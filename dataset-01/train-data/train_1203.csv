3,Decent thriller,"The stars of this film are what attracted me to it. Besides Willis and Berry, I've always enjoyed Giovanni Ribisi as well. The premise itself wasn't all that interesting to me, but I gave the film a try anyway.It's a decent movie, not a ""good"" or a ""great"" one. It was worth a one-time viewing and had an interesting plot with a great twist at the end. I thought I had it all figured out, but the ending proved me wrong.You might want to rent this one first rather than purchasing."
1,WHY??????,"Until this I thought Derailed was the worst film EVER. Boy was I WRONG. Dialogue, Direction, Acting... HORRIFIC. A Giant mess from first to last. Hitchcock was turning in his grave. And the ending? WHY"
2,Disappointing,"This movie tries way too hard. It is such a struggle to be suspenseful, but it never quite makes it. Willis' character is boring. The dialogue is not very interesting. I think this is the most I have ever heard Berry say the F-word. Wow.DOn't waste your money on this one."
2,Bad Movie,"After her friend is murdered, journalist Holly Berry, with the help of a friend, goes underground, working for Bruce Willis who she believes is the murderer.The performances of Berry and Willis were enough to keep me interested, but they weren't enough to cover the crazy plot and implausible ending. It has a few good moments of suspense and tension, but I was completely lost and confused as the finger of guilt bounced from character to character. The plot was all over the place, confusing me at every turn. To make things worse I felt cheated by the ridiculous ""twist"" at the end. Viewers who invest their time and money deserve much better that this cheap and trashy finale.The only question I have is why would Berry and Willis agree to do this mess?"
2,Weak and disappointing,"What in the world has happened to Halle Berry? Can't she act any more? Judging from this movie I'd say: No - she can't... And Bruce Willis is ... well, he's Bruce Willis. And why does she have to participate in a mediocre thriller like this one? Because it is very mediocre. The beginning is quite promising, and I was ready for a nice, clean thriller. But what followed was like a bad version of some Michael Crichton novel. Perfect Stranger lacked meaning, taste, and creativity and is just another one of those ""movies with a twist."" FYI: The movie was a long advertisement with way too much product placement.Then they must have chosen the worst ending. The film is not creative, not inventive, implausible, sometimes ridiculous. No, it's not a disaster. But a major disappointment."
2,Not impressed....,Not nearly the movie I thought it was going to be. It seemed to me a big foiled mess that the writer's tried to make sense of in the end but it just didn't wash. Totally unbelievable and down right messy film.
1,I don't know what to say ;-l,"I have a theory that you can tell how bad a movie is going to be, based on the trailers that come before it. When I saw some bad trailers at the beginning of this dvd, I knew I was in for a bad movie and I was right. To be honest, it's hard for me to write this review because I don't get what the movie was about at all. Not only could I not follow it, I wasn't actually interested in following it even if I could. I normally love Bruce Willis and Halle Berry and when I knew that Gary Dourdan was in it too, I really wanted to watch this, but none of these actors could change the fact that this is a weak plotted movie that doesn't thrill or excite. In hindsight, I wish I hadn't bought this. I wouldn't even tell my friends to watch it on free to air tv.I'm sorry to say that I thought this movie sucks. Right from the start and even to the 'thrilling and twisting' end, I couldn't have disliked a movie more."
4,Not Barry's Best but good and gritty,"As this movie runs It's course I was always drawn In with suspicions of what was the ending, and the way the movie has this dirty undertone that runs through It-Together these elements along with what I thought was a good plot grant It with flaws.(If you want bad enough you can pick the flaws out of any movie). And these two as best friend's? Not a good pairing.(Barry & her cohort)But It's good old fashioned entertainment. I was entertained and liked the gratitous sex with Barry. Willis Is good acting and makes his small role good.And to be real this movie deserves at least 3 stars. How It can be generating an average of less Is beyond me.Some of the complaints I've heard (Close ups by the director) ridiculous.Movies are made for widescreen now!This Is so worth the rental price.There are surprises nobody will see coming about all the characters.And of course the best surprise of all at the end."
3,BORING,"This movie was so BORING...up until the last five minutes. I'll have to admit, though, that those last five minutes were GREAT. I just wish the whole movie would have been that good."
3,Not the Best But Worth the Watch,In my opinion not the worst film I've seen this year but not the best from Halle Berry or Bruce Willis.A few unexpected twists the acting can be a bit wooden at times but worth the watch.The Blu Ray transfer is not too bad but there are better films to show case the hi def experience.
1,HORRBILE MOVIE!! Very bad!!,"I have to say...this movie is the worst movie that I have seen so far this year!!!Bruce Willis was okay in it but Halle Berry was the serial killer??? Everything..EVERYTHING pointed to Bruce Willis as the murderer and then Halle's friend ""finally"" figures out that it was her that was killing everyone because she had buried her dad several years ago. STUPID MOVIE!!I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!"
2,OK THRILLER SAVED BY A SURPRISE ENDING! 2 1/2 STARS!,"'Perfect Stranger' starts out promising, but quickly begins to meander and become routine. This isn't helped by the lackluster performances by Berry, Willis and Ribisi who I usually love to watch. The film has a good start and a good ending which makes it watch-able, but in the middle there is too much filler and not enough meat! I rated it 2 1/2 stars 2 for the film and another 1/2 for a good ending. Rent it.....don't buy it!"
3,Not as bad as I initially thought it would be! I enjoyed it!,"Investigative reporter Rowena Price (Halle Berry) is trying to track down leads in her friends murder. Suspecting that it might be, business man/philander Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis), Price goes undercover as an employee in his advertising agency. What could have been the typical suspense movie, ends up being a decent thriller with a twist at the end. There is everything that would make a story interesting...blackmail, suspense, romance, etc. And I'm not saying that Berry deserves an Oscar or anything, but I did enjoy the movie, and think that you will too!"
2,How far would you go to keep this movie from being released?,"I was severely disappointed of this advance screening of the new Halle Berry-Bruce Willis vehicle. In trying too hard to have a twisted plot, the writers neglected to give us admirable characters. There is so much pin-pointing and flip-flopping, that Perfect Stranger becomes irrelevant as a movie. Because no one cares about the fate of any of the characters, their fate becomes inconsequential and the audience gets bored with the movie.The movie's stars try to do an admirable job of saving the script, but their efforts can go only so far. Even Giovani Ribisi, who I consider one of the unsung, but one of the most talented actors of today, can't save this movie from sinking to new lows.I would only recommend this movie to Berry's die-hard fans, and then only when it plays on demand or as a Netflix rental."
2,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""I WISH I STAYED A STRANGER TO THIS UNPERFECT STORY!""","The advertisements for this flick, try to pull you in based on Halle Berry's looks and Bruce Willis's name recognition. Those are the last two semi-intelligent things the producers of this movie attempt. The acting is wooden and any attempt at any true human emotion is plastic and insincere at best. Halle's acting is phony and Willis seems to be sleep walking through his role simply for a paycheck. The ending is so contrived, that it is an affront to any viewer with a semblance of intelligence. When they give the myriad of ""last-minute"" scenario's, they are all from so far out in left field, that the producer could just as easily put you and me in a final scene and have it be more plausible."
2,Terrible movie,"After this, Halle doesn't have a prayer. And Bruce Willis had better PRAY that LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD redeems him. This movie was completely awful! Very slow, lacking in suspense, and just a huge waste of $9. I haven't been in a theater since RENT (for good reason!), and so I was surprised that the trailer for this movie intrigued me. I typically wait for the movies to come On Demand.The lead part could have been played by any typical TV movie star. I guess Halle and Bruce only gave big name recognition to the film. The movie was raunchier than it needed to be and the story just diddn't flow quite like you would want. I will give them props for the twist at the end...that was unexpected, but the movie had dragged on so long that it was hard to care by then.SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,"Fair beginning, but terrible ending","I'll admit it, the beginning of the movie was pretty good. It kept me interested, the acting was good, and so far the script was pretty good as well.But after a while, the movie just got completely predictable and the script became horrendous. Whatever beginnings of a plot line the writers had soon diminished and the ending was completely ridiculous. The movie was not satisfying in anyway; it left me with an incomplete feeling. The only thing that was up to par, in my opinion, was the acting. The actors did a pretty great job with the not so great script they got.My advice is, save your money and buy another movie(or rent or however else you may see it)."
1,"She is the bad guy....no, really she is!","That is the ""twist"" at the end and trust me, it is not worth the wait! Shame on James Foley and crew for this POS - should have simply gone straight to DVD and then forgotten. Talk about a waste of talent and energy - including my (and hopefuuly not your) time to watch it!"
2,Not very thrilling,"I knew this film got bad reviews, but the trailer looked sleek and sexy and I thought: Halle Berry, Giovanni Ribisi, Bruce Willis--how bad can it be? Well, it turns out, quite bad.The main problem is that, for a thriller, this film is not very thrilling at all. You never get much sense that there's impending danger to Ro (Berry) or, for that matter, to any of the characters. And yes, the end comes as a total surprise, but that's mainly because it's so damn ridiculous and nonsensical. It's almost as if aliens had landed at the end of the movie and we saw Halle Berry being taken away in a UFO. Surprise!"
2,The surprise ending can't save a bad movie,"Halle Berry and Bruce Willis can't save this boring thriller in which a investigative reporter(Halle) tries to catch the supposed killer(Bruce) of her friend with the help of a computer spec(Giovanni Ribisi).I won't get into details because I don't want to spoil the pleasure for those who will see the movie.No thrill, no suspense,a weak plot, too many computer details,worth seeing only for Giovanni Ribisi(in case you're not a fan of Halle).Better to leave it a ""Perfect Stranger""."
1,Building Down as Opposed to Building Up.,"If you are like me and decide to ignore all the opinions of people like me, half way through you'll probably feel that the film was somewhat slow, but as I did you probably won't understand the bad reviews. The characters are very strong and the acting as actually quite good; the tension is rising and the threat of death is imminent. The film though goes backward from their. All the tension dissolves; the characters petter out; flash-backs change the events that have already occurred; new motives for characters undermine the momentum of the story; and the threat of danger disappears. The film ends without ever having a single validated moment of suspense. Actually builds down as opposed to building up."
1,Doesn't fit the NB-2LH canon batteries,"I bought this charger along with my new Canon SLR camera, but it is made to charge Canon BP-208/308/315 batteries only. I am in the process of returning the product."
5,Just what the PT orderd,With arthritis in the base of my thumb some days and nights I need warmth and support. This gives me back my ability to function and sleep.
2,This is not a movie,"These all can be found on netflix streaming, thought I was buying a movie. There are no Diego movies, your better off getting a scooby Doo movie."
3,It's OK.,"The product, First Aid Kit Stafta-25 Person, is fine however the item description is in correct for seller acehardwareoutlet. The dimensions are 10 1/2"" X 7 1/4"" X 2 1/2"".Metal case.No gasket - this is not water proof or air tightRough edges - it snagged my pants on first inspectionThe ingredients appear to be as listed."
4,What you see is what you get,"This is a good, affordable metal first aid kit that will hang on a wall. Delivery was prompt. What you see is what you get."
2,Save your time and money,"Okay, so I liked the premise, and I liked the Sherlock Holmes references. But that was all I liked. This novel plods. The characters are sketchy, the plot barely there, and the narration put me straight to sleep."
2,"Scary looking, but terrible to wear","This thing is really awful wear. It sheds fur constantly, if you have any stubble at all it will get all over your face and tickle like crazy. You can't see out if it, and you look out the mouth. I put it on for pictures and then took it right back off."
3,Werewolf deluxe mask,Fast ship. Mask not as realistic in appearance as in the picture but satisfactory. Thank you.
4,Evil horde destroys any technological advances,"Any time a technological advance is about to occur an evil horde totally decimates the area, This goes on for centuries. The main character is asked to take a letter, believed to have been written by Christ, and get it authenticated. The evil horde tries to stop the journey. You will have to read the book to find out how it ends."
4,A beautiful coffee-table style book with some helpful info.,"As other reviewers have said, this is a gorgeous book. It's very oversized--larger even than most coffee-table style books--and has lovely pictures throughout which cover every aspect of wedding celebrations. Included, of course, are many samples of Wang's own work as a bridal gown designer as well as photos from her own wedding. As a wedding planner, however, this book is less useful. Although Wang does include her own commentary, some of which is interesting and helpful, there really isn't enough information for the book to be used as comprehensive planner. Furthermore, the organization of the book is somewhat confusing, as it does not follow a typical wedding planning chronology. Despite these issues, brides-to-be and others are likelyto enjoy this book, if only to ""look at the pictures."""
5,For those who expect the best,"This book is a must have for those who enjoy weddings and the celebration that surrounds them. Ms. Wang not only provides a detailed description of the perfect wedding but also shares her insight on receptions, invitations, guest lists, flowers and bridal jewelry. The second half of the book is devoted to the construction of wedding finery and gives the reader a glimpse into the House of Vera Wang."
3,Disappointing,"Quite frankly, I expected more from this book, particularly from the photos that were used. As a wedding florist, I have seen many of the photos in other publications and was disappointed at what seemed to be laziness in obtaining and creating original ideas and examples. The information is wonderful and very helpful. Vera Wang certainly knows the wedding fashion industry quite well. But, if you are looking for fresh, new ideas and have a large selection of wedding guides in your collection, you will see lots of overlap."
5,Elegant Fabulousness,Beautifully presented... a wonderful showcase of blissfully simple yet incredibly elegant gowns... also features glimpses into fabulous famous brides & their weddings.... very inspirational & truly lovely ....
2,Just a coffee table book,"Please don't buy this book if you need honest, reasonable tips for your wedding. This has some beautiful photographs and makes a nice coffee table book but it is waaay to huge to lug around as one may wish to do. Photos are nice but that is basically it. In addition, I wish it had more photographs of gowns. Doesn't have as many photographs of a variety of gowns as I had hoped."
4,Delicious,"Vera Wang presents weddings that make you want to find YOUR GUY right away. If you are already married, it may fill you with regrets. The layout is large and inspiring. In terms of details, you will be happy. I do agree about using the vows and song in Ken Agori's novel (carried by Amazon). I understand a CD is available and Celine may record it...Vera will make you a romantic, even if you're cynical"
3,"Complete, but for the vows and music...","check out Katherine's wedding scene in Defenders of the Holy Grail (skip the rest of that novel if you want). Really, Wang's book is very thorough and will help you, although it's a bit pricey...."
3,Simple Production,"Not as excited as I think live music should be...Simple camera angles, lighting effects were almost annoying because the lights are pointed at the audience in a well light hall. A theatre setting may have been a better choice to spruce up the atmoshere, I found myself looking at the people and not the band. The production did not match the girls talents and abilities."
3,CD,"I wish that I liked his music, but I don't. I like a couple of them pretty well. Having the CD is mostly useful to me because I am a French teacher in Maine and I wish to be able to play his music to my students. I want to understand what is important to the Québécois people and to pass that onto my students. I know this folk singer was important to them, but also he was loved in France. Unfortunately, the text is not included for his songs -- this is most unfortunate."
5,GREAT HILLBILLY PUNK RECORD,"IT WAS ACTUALLY RELEASED IN 89 ON A DIFFERENT LABEL SO IT PRESEEDED ""HAYSEED"" - WHICH IT BLOWS AWAY. WHITETRASH COWPUNK AT ITS FINEST - TRAILOR PARKS, DRINKING, WALMARTS, GIRLS, T-TOPS AND MUSCLE CARS. IF YOU LIKE CRYPT RECORDS, AND YOU LIKE ROCK AND ROLL, YOU MUST OWN THIS ONE. ITS VERY LOUD!"
4,Eela Craig - self-titled (Garden Of Delights) import CD,"Eela Craig comes from Linz,Austria,staying in existence for a bit - long enough to put out six lp's.This one originally came out in 1971.Eela Craig plays somewhat progressive mid tempo rock,laced with blues and jazz influences.One element of this disc that really holds my interest is Harold Zuschrader's superb flute playing,specially on ""Selfmade Trip"" and ""A New Day"".Also dug the eleven-minute somewhat jazzy ""Indra Elegy"".The vocals of sax player Wil Orthofer are okay,but the band's true talent seems to lean toward their playing.Wanted to mention the two short but sweet psychedelic tracks,""Irminsul"" and ""Yggdrasil"".Overall,this is a CD reissue that will probably make an impression on MOST prog fans.Mostly because it's got a style all it's own.Should appeal to fans of Gentle Giant and maybe early-mid '70's King Crimson."
3,Not as bad as I thought,"Although still not as explicit as some of the titles from Penthouse or HotBody, this video did show a lot more than was is normally expected from a Playboy video. In fact, I was very surprised. Anyway, if you like strippers, this one is worth a look."
5,Hallelujah!,"Let me just say that Tod A. is God and this album proves it. What a swagger! What an sneer! What a voice! This album will bring you up when you're down and keep you up when you're up. I read a review saying the songs are like little bastard children dancing on the devil's grave. Can I hear an amen, brothers and sister?"
5,Royalties,"The songs from the fifties are classics. They bring back many memories of good times. The sad memories were never getting paid royalties for our hard work and efforts in recording those many wonderful songs. The royalties always seemed to vanish. How about doing the right thing for a change and contact me so we can talk. My e-mail oddly enough is no1passion@aol.com. Original lead singer of The Passions. Come on Gene, Elliot, Sol do the right thing. Anyone who can contribute any useful infomation I would like to here from you."
5,Great DVD,"Having never seen Norah Jones live in concert, watching this DVD in surround was the next best thing.Great production and it is like you are there."
3,Norah is of course wonderful. Video...not so much,"Norah Jones if of course wonderful in this performance, however the video work is iffy. Sure it has merit but the art is lost and the shots are VERY dull. The director was just throwing takes around for no reason. I am a professional director specializing in this line of work and I am just surprised that Norah would want to use this as it is fairly bland.Maybe I am being critical, however there are a bunch of mistakes that are just unacceptable."
4,Norah pleases her audience once again,"I love just about everything Norah Jones does including this dvd. I think she sounded good, and I don't think the dvd was too dark in places. But because I gave this dvd 4 stars instead of 5 stars was because of her nasty comment to the audience after she sang Rosie's Lullaby. The audience clapped their hands and she snapped at them as if they did not like the song. I guess she wanted then to jump for joy or something, I don't really know why she reacted that way to them. I still will continue to buy most of her cd's and dvd's however."
4,Very spiritual Sounds,"The first time I heard it, it didn't do much for me. After the 2nd or 3rd time, I was truly touched by his spirit. I especially like the title track as well as the jazzy ""More Than Life"". ""Bless Me "" takes you to a higher plane. The speak over by Pastor Eric Alexander is truly annointing. I feel the best is yet to come from this talented young artist"
5,Solid and Handy,"Perfect for home jobs. Holds everything I need. Great, sturdy construction. Couldn't ask for more."
5,Awesome Program for teaching to read...,I love how the Saxon phonics K is setup to teach children to read. We are still currently using this curriculum and it is wonderful. My daughter loves it because it includes neat projects that ties into learning.
1,two tines came loose second time used,The second time I used the rake two tines came loose and came out about three inches. I had previously used a bamboo rake (not this brand) for six years without a problem. This Bamboo Flexrake was purchased from Amazon.
4,World Tour of Healing TEas,"This is an excellent book for people who are into healing teas. The author divides the book up by region with a section on China, Japan, India, Tibet, Arabia, the Americas, and Europe. She talks about the healing traditions of each region and the types of teas they used. I especially enjoyed the section on HIldegard von Bingen. This woman contributed much to herbal healing in an age when women didn't have the privilages and opportunities they have today. The book also contains recipes and the photography is superb. It was the picture on the cover that caused me to pick up this book. -- Val Lull"
4,"Catchy Punk Gems, Hailing from Father Deutschland","This album is great. Catchy dance-able punk tunes not unlike those of the first King Khan & BBQ Show record. This group is obscure, and it is tough to find out much about them, but this I know: They are proteges of the great Billy Childish, who produced this album. This even brings to mind The Oblivians, and their peers. If you like Childish, The Black Lips, Detroit Cobras, The Willowz, or any of those sorts of groups, you will love this rare gem. The songs are in German, which I do not speak, but I can still enjoy this. It's just some great punk, with a Thee Milkshakes sort of feel. Excelent record."
2,Mediocre From a Talented Writer,"I really like this author and have read a lot of her other work. However, this novel was a disappointment: the heroine is insipid and passive (she's the daughter of a famous novelist with a cult following but it never even occurs to her to wonder why she and the grandparents who raised her don't have any money from her mother's work?) and the subplot about the raised riverboat is too factual to really serve as a plot point for character growth. The timing of the events at the end also felt really rushed and contrived. IMHO, the relatively minor ""father"" character was the best one in the book.Take my advice and read _Summer's End_ by this author instead (highly recommended), or _More Than You Dreamed_, or _Again_."
1,Last Resort,"Read this book only if you have nothing else to read! Both the characters and dialog are boring. I cared less about the characters after I read it than before I started. The author does capture the feel of small towns, but without interesting characters who wants to read about small towns! If you can't sleep, this is the book to pick up."
2,Save Your Money!!!!,"This book is so poorly written that I thought it was a writing project for a high school class. The characters' thoughts are silly one liners without any depth. Their feelings for each other are shallow and the heroine's excuse for remaining aloof from the hero is trite. The story contains the usual fare rehashed into a silly romance without any connection between the characters and a limited story line. I could live with anything if the writing style were not so amateurish and the plot had more depth and the lovers actually connected in a believable manner. Eleanora's Ghost is just a means of moving the story along, but you never really believe in her possible existence and never feel her emotions. I'm not sure what else this author has written, but I for one will stay away from any of her romance novels."
5,"Foundations for OOP, C#, and .NET Framework","This is the only C# book I currently own, but after reading the reader reviews, this one seemed a good choice. It is 2 weeks later, and I have finished going through the book and the downloaded code examples that come along with the book. There is not much I can add to all the praise the other readers have given this author and this book, but let me say, ""I agree!"".I think this book is the best ""Intro to ... "" book I've ever read. I needed to not only learn C# and the .NET Framework, but OOP in general. Robert J. Oberg's Introduction to C# Using .NET book teaches all these things in a very natural way that makes it easy. I've learned more reading this book over the past week than I learned in the $1700 5 day Intro to C# class I attended using Microsoft training material."
3,decent beginner's tutorial,"If you just want to spend the bucks to quickly get started with C# without understanding it much, this book will help. It covers a lot of ground fast, but very much on the surface. Unfortunately, examples often do not prove the point and events example was more erroneus than helpful. And this book is virtually useless later on as a reference material, because the material is not well organized and depth is missing."
1,Did they photocopy this book?,"I just opened up the OOP section and noticed that the diagrams that are in the book appear to be photocopied. One diagram shows an inheritance relationship between some banking objects. There are nine objects in the diagram and you CAN NOT see the lines bordering each object, nor the lines between the objects. Most of the other line diagrams are fuzzy and not solid (imagine taking a faint line drawing and photocopying it). Two big thumbs down on printing quality. As for the material, I have read about 3-4 paragraphs, so I can't comment on it. I am seriously considering returning it since some of the diagrams are unreadable."
2,Zeroxed Book?,"I didn't like this book. It does not go into the individual concepts enough. I found it to be really unhelpful. And sorry, but my desk already has a paperweight. And I have issues about spending any amount of money for what amounts to a bound version of copied paper. The entire book was a very poor zerox copy."
1,Don't buy off this page,"Shows price which should be for dozen, but charge that for 1 ball. Returned it am waiting over 3 weeks for refund"
2,received the used helmet,"ordered brand new, but received the used helmet.attached pics for proof.color of helmet is in black and also its matte."
4,Perfect Fit,I bought these for my nephews to accompany their new skateboards. That have loved every minute of them. The black color was perfect for both the little boys and the teenagers.
1,Mushroom head,"So I'm sure this helmet will protect me from scrambling my brains on the road. That's a very important feature, duh. But as far as looks...mushroom head."
3,Dot Recordings,"The multi-talented Roy Clark is showcased here with another volume of late 60's to mid 70's hits. This has some good ones but is not nearly as vital as the Volume 1 disc. Good singer, Great picker, Good collection. Roy Clark needs to be included in the Country Music Hall of Fame."
5,One of America's best novelists,"This one or ""Try"" are the novels I usually offer to those of my friends who have not read Cooper yet but may be uneasy about some of the content. What is often missed is his pitch-perfect ear for contemporary dialogue, his wit and marvelously graceful prose. Some compare him to Jean Genet. This is fair, and perhaps a nice thought to have when you begin reading his work, but in fact Dennis Cooper is better than that. Better than William Burroughs as well. He is one writer here now who will definitely be read in one hundred years (if people still by then read -- which I think they will)."
2,"Kiddie Porn, LSD Trips and other uplifting themes","Cooper is a good writer and a -self acknowledged- very sick man. His only value, nice prose.Cooper is very much into violent descriptions of his own -dreamlike- homosexual activity.Basically this is an account of Cooper's violent sexual urges and activities involving runaway, drug addicted boys.It's not really that good..."
1,No Magic For My Motorcycle Tank,"I bought this product based on the positive reviews, hoping it would at least ameliorate the threadlike scratches on my motorcycle tank, where the previous owner had used a tank bag. To be fair, the scratches were deep, most going through to the metal. Still, I had hopes that the scratch stick would at least fill in the scratches with a temporary waxy plug.After several attempts, I realized it was hopeless. It was basically like coloring over the scratches with a waxy crayon, but as soon as I wiped off the excess wax, the scratches came clean as well.I tried the black fluid polish, with the same result. No matter how I applied it, or carefully removed the excess, the scratches were unveiled as if never treated.So if you're just looking to improve some very minimal surface scratches it might work for you as it apparently did for other reviewers. But if you have scratches to the metal, even hairline ones, don't expect anything at all from this treatment."
1,Didn't work for me,"Was really excited to try this on my black Chrysler 300. It has some minor and not so minor scratches. I tried multiple times, following the directions to the letter, but never had any success with it - not even on the minor scratches."
3,"Works, but.......","I wasn't really impressed with this wax. I followed the directions to a tee. I was hoping to hide the swirl marks that have started showing up on my motorcycle, but was a little disappointed in the products ability to do so. It did hide some, but not many."
5,Perfect Product,"The product is just what I needed to cover some small nicks and scratches on the hood of my black vehicle. The way is dark and creamy, goes on smooth and wipes off easily. There is even a ""scratch pen"" (black wax pen) to fill in deeper marks before waxing."
2,Marketing Gimmick,"Just an average wax/polish...there are many other better products for similar cost. The chip stick doesn't fill and stay. The shine is no better than most others. This goes for any color, not just the black showed here...I tried red on my Yamaha, black on my Honda - no difference."
5,Cheaper than a body-shop...,"I've owned several older cars with minor paint and scratch issues.This stuff is a great way to revitalize your car's appearance withoutthe hassle of touch-up paint or the expense of a body-shop. As longas you don't mind putting some muscle into it, using this wax will freshenyour existing paint and camouflage minor scratches and scuffs, since thepigment in the wax blends in with your car's paint. If you don't want to breakthe budget while also seeing the fruits of your own labor, ColorMagic is a goodsolution for you and your vehicle."
3,Nothing special,"I'll lead this by saying I'm a bit particular when it comes to my car. With that said, this product doesn't do that great a job in covering up even faint scratches. My car is black and I used this product to cover up some hairline scratches, and although it did improve the look of the car quite a bit, you can definitely see the different coloration from even a few feet away. For $12, it's not bad and my expectations may have been a bit high after reading all the positive reviews but don't purchase this item thinking it's going to magically make the blemishes on your car disappear completely."
3,turtle wax color magic with chip stick,"I have a three inch long, down to the metal scratch on one of my car doors. I worked on the scratch for about 30 minutes. I discovered early into the job that the chip stick is the most important part of the process. Once I was ""finished"" the scratch was still visible, but not as pronounced. It worked well on less serious scratches. I am going to try and work on it again, maybe if I get more of the chip stick wax pushed into the scratch the results will be better."
5,It is a great book to get great information from.,"This is a very good book. This guy can turn a completely rusted out car into a new one. I am talking about a car that anyone else would take the motor out, and put in another one. He shows you how to patch and repair anything, without having to go and buy a piece of the car. And how to do it with budget tools."
2,Sketchy at Best,"An adequate overview of car bodywork - but not an authoritative, or exhaustive treatise on the subject. A reasonable starting point, but don't just read this and then charge off and begin a full-scale body restoration on your expensive classic car."
4,Light fixture,"You get what you pay for. This was a ""cheap"" light. It does the job, but seemed pretty fragile when installing it."
4,A Good Primer to the Science of Names,"I have found this book to be an excellent example of an introductory offering on the subjects of surnames. It has a good sampling of names from many language sources. The author illustrates the need to understand that names do not ""come from a place"" but from a language. I am using this book as a textbook in a class that I am teaching. All of my students are American students..that is to say, they are all American citizens.This is a good book about a very ineresting subject.....geographical politics notwithstanding."
1,Be careful with this book!,"This book was conceived from an incorrect perception of ""America"". United States is not only America. What about the other countries such Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Argentina, etc. Maybe, the correct title for this book is ""Some surnames in United States of America"". Since the United States of America were forged with immigrants, the author did not respect the particularities of other surnames established in the United States as jews, russians, germans, frenchs, irish, among others."
2,Manufacturer will not sell replacement parts!,"The ES-6000 is indeed a powerful unit, but the case started breaking apart after a few years. First the sides where the battery clamps attach fell off, then the center handle broke off. The company refuses to sell replacement plastic case parts, and instead only offers a ""refurbishment service"" which costs as much as a new unit. With the clamp holders and handle missing, there is no place to safely store the the clamps (which are always ""live""), thus making the unit in this condition extremely dangerous and unsafe to use."
2,Junk product,this is junk battery pack do not buy any battery pack from Amazon.com as you can not return due to it's hazardous malarial
3,Good lichen guide,Very nice lichen guide. Good color pictures and lots of information that will enable amateurs to identify common alpine lichens. Covers about 60 species - wish it covered more! Money well spent.
5,Every Track Is a Delight,"Several years ago The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website included a list entitled 500 Songs That Shaped Rock And Roll. The Delmore Brothers' ""Hillbilly Boogie"" made that list. After picking up this CD it's easy to see why. Though they were a country act, they incorporated blues, boogie and rockabilly elements into their sound. Rabon and Alton Delmore recorded for King from 1946 until 1952, when Rabon died of lung cancer. [Alton died in 1964.] The twenty tracks included here (half of which are originals) provide a terrific overview of two musicians who--as the liner notes point out--""were too modern for the determined traditionalism of bluegrass, (but) too oldtime for the hip-swivelling of rock 'n' roll."" Every track is a delight. This is important listening. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
5,Simply the Best,"What a superb album. Taken from the Brothers' years with Cincinnati based King Records (1945 - 1952), the album features classics such as 'Blues Stay Away From Me', with its highly distinctive guitar work, and my own favorite, 'Hillbilly Blues', as well as the title track. The album is a nice mixture of blues and boogie-woogie, with the Brothers' sweet harmonies backed up by some great musicians. Apart from Wayne Raney's superb harmonica, check out Zeke Turner's electric guitar work on 'Boogie Woogie Baby'. And is that Merle Travis backing up on 'Hillbilly Blues'? And then there's Roy Lanham's electric guitar on 'Peach Tree Street Boogie'. But every track on this album has something to commend it. So don't mess around. Buy it! You won't regret it."
5,these guys RULE!,"I saw these guys as Sleazefest in Chapel Hill, NC a few years back, and there is no describing how much they rocked! It was freakin' crushing! They stomped all over yer balls dude! I totally freakin' ruled! Nine Pound Hammer rules yer (...)!"
5,Thank The South For Nine Pound Hammer!,"There are not many decent ""Cowpunk"" acts out there but even if there were a million of them these guys would shatter their asses and teach them all a lesson on drinkin' whisky, living in a trailer and playing the raunchiest Rock-N-Roll committed to the digital medium.""Hayseed Timebomb"" is nothing short of a punk masterpiece equal to the like standards of The Ramones and The Sex Pistols. Hard driving chords and lyrics that are so natural and filled with humor that you'll want to listen to this one over and over. Blaine Cartwright from Nashville Pussy is in the lineup here and frankly as much as I love NP, nothing they've ever done remotely comes close to this collection and that's saying a whole helluva lot!You're a fool if you love Punk/Southern Boogie and you don't pick this disc up. Do yourself a big favor and buy this."
4,Nice hillbilly power-pop.,"Trashy, slick, deep-fried power-pop/garage here. Packed with good cuts, but man, the title track is simply exceptional. Good cover of ""Wreck of the Old 97,"" too. It's on Crypt. If you like the genre, you need this."
5,book,"I owned a copy of this book back in high school and somehow lost it during moving or something. Glad to have it back in my ""library""."
3,Recent purchase,"This is a fun book of somewhat unique cartoons that I am delighted tohave in my collection of Kliban books. His work is not of universal taste but for those who find his humor delightful, it is a treasure."
5,Can't sleep without finishing this one!,"Michael McDowell is indeed one of the best horror fiction writers, and all fans of the genre should scour the used bookstores for any of his works. However, this is one of the best. I literally was too scared to turn out the lights reading this book, so I read it all in one night!!"
3,Just OK,"The first half of the well-written ""Cold Moon over Babylon"" by Michael McDowell is an atmospherically-drawn whodunit which holds the readers interest, due mostly to some very wise curveballs thrown by the author. The second half is solely based on the villain evil ways and is, alas, the weakest part of the story. Karma does take its time, and the development in between gets tiresome rather quickly. In the end, what was supposed to be a horror novel is actually more of a whodunit with ghostly benefits. Don't get me wrong, their apparitions are fun and descriptive but they happen so much later in the plot that the rewards are not as strong as they should be. McDowell is a fine writer indeed but the overall enjoyment I got from this book is still pretty much average.-----Martin Boucher"
2,A LITTLE TATTERED,"I was told the book was like new, & I got it in time and I'm glad to have it but it was a little tattered. The cost was good though even for the shape it was in."
2,piano music,"I have always been fond of soundtracks especially by James Horner but I thought I'd try The Winter Guest by Michael Kamen. I'll stick to James Horner. There is little variety in this soundtrack, and it's all piano. One's life is not all piano! One's life is a mixture of many different instruments so there is no boredom. This was boredom."
5,Wow!,"Such a beautiful soundtrack! One listen and I fell in love with the nuances of sound, the way the music flows together, and now I cannot stop playing it. Easily the most soothing item in my collection. I highly recommend...you will not be disappointed."
5,A must-read for anyone with an immigrant past--most of us!!,"Patricia and Elda's story brings to heart not only what it was like for immigrants at the turn of the last century, but what it must be like for today's arrivals--coming to America without English or many resources, armed only with a strong love of family and desire to improve life for their children"
4,"Inspiring tale of determination, compassion","I read this book over a 24 hour period, a personal record. Elda's voice comes through clearly in every page of Patricia Henley's writing. The early part of the book, Elda's journey across the Atlantic by steerage boat and then across the country by rail, sets the tone for the later adventures of her family in San Francisco's North Beach district. Elda survived the Depression and further challenges to build her life and family with determination and compassion. It's no surprise that her philosophy is that ""the only real disability is a bad attitude""."
5,"Superb tool, thoroughly pleased","This is yet another tool I purchased from Amazon.com that I have been completely happy with. The price was great, along with no shipping and tax, and fast delivery again made it a pleasure to buy from Amazon. Now on to the tool. I bought it about six weeks ago and have put it to heavy use. Cleaning rust, grinding welds, sanding fiberglass and metal. The tool has been used for hours at a time, sometimes non stop for 20 minutes or more. It is light and small enough to get into tight spots, but it has plenty of power. It is very noisy as all these grinders are, so wear ear protection and safety glasses. My only problem is that Amazon lists this tool as being USA made, but it is actually made in Mexico. This was disappointing to see when I got it, but then again few tools are USA made now a days anyway. Remember to buy quality grinding, sanding, and wire wheels as you do not want a cheap one spinning at 10,000 RPM being out of balance, flying apart and right into you."
3,Not that heavy duty,DeWalt makes good tools for the homeowner. I purchased this grinder because it looked and handled well. I wanted to use the grinder with a cut off wheel but found it can not without an adapter. DeWalt needs to put this information on the box. I had to return the grinder for this reason. This heavy duty grinder only does light duty tasks.
4,don't like the switch,"a job came up where i need a grinder quick so i ran down to the store and bought this one without shopping around or really thinking about it. first i don't like the switch, is feels strange to me, but that is probably because i have spent many many hours with a trigger switch type sander/polisher in my hands. second this tool sounds flimsy to me, like the motor dosn't run that smooth. but i put a ($$$)cup type dimond blade on it and i have been running it with the trigger locked in the on position for countless hours grinding the edges of flagstone pavers and it hasn't acted up yet, so that's got say something...seems like it will last?"
5,Buy it DO NOT HESITATE,I bought this at my local home depot for grinding down welds preping metal to be welded and rust removal on my dads old toyota coralla soon to be mine when I get it all fixed. It work perfectly right out of the box. only thing is it is a littel to easy to disingauge the trigger lock but that is problebly good for safty. It is solid the thing is perfect Listen to me buy it now and do not purches anything but Dewalt.
1,If you like to get grinding dust in your eyes buy this!!!!,"I work in a major welding and fab. shop. where we really use the grinders, not like the other reveiws. Dewalt has made the worst grinder ever.The DW402 was designed with very serious flaw which could send you straight in the ER. (several of my co workers ended up in the hospital)1. Where the exhaust blows out, everything that is grinded will blow right in your eyes. Believe me I know it happen to me.(with safety glasses on) Also so many people were getting eye injuries the Company I work for pulled them from the shop floor."
4,Who's your favorite big red dog???,"It's Clifford of course! My 15 month old has never seen Clifford, but I could not pass this up when I saw it on Amazon. We had already bought him a hobby horse, but returned it and bought this instead. I'm thoroughly impressed! It's sturdy, soft, perfect size for my toddler, has cute sayings, and is quite safe. Even at his young age, he didn't fall off!!! I'm so glad we got this for our son!!!"
5,great clifford toy,"well we got this for the grandson for xmas. he loves clifford. he really likes it. buy it on sale. was easy to put together, very sturdy and durable. this will last for years and behanded down from child to child for sure. this is a winner."
4,"adorable, sturdy and fairly priced","I was very pleased with the Clifford rocker. It appears to be very well made. My 17 month-old granddaughter loves Clifford so she loved this. At first she needed a little help getting up on it as it is quite large, but with practice and supervision, she is able to get up on it by herself and rock. She presses buttons on his collar making his mouth move while he speaks. Very nice toy."
3,"Beautiful to look at, painful to listen to.","This radio has proven to be a conversation piece in our dining room, as it does look rather cool and elegant. And when you play older recordings, say some Bing Crosby on Decca or Billie Holiday on Columbia, it does a fine job and seems to match the period it's trying to represent.When you play a newer recording, say the new Michael Buble CD, however, it falls majorly short and flat. This has probably the worst sounding stereo sound I've ever come across on a unit like this. Those who like to listen to newer music should look elsewhere. I am just lucky I like to listen to the older stuff, and for that it works just fine."
4,Sounds good with CD. Radio difficult to tune in.,"The CD player in the Crosley CR32 Cathedral Radio With CD Player is a good, solid transport. The playback quality is good considering the small speakers, but the 1/8"" stereo jack output on the front works great for routing the output to powered PC speakers or headphones, and with that setup, it sounds much better. Two minor issues: The radio tuner dial is not centered in the window so the vertical reticle does not line up with the frequencies on the dial; and the FM antenna wire could stand to be be another foot longer. In short, it's worth the price."
3,Returned the first one,"I only gave it three stars because I had to return the first one due to a defective CD player. It was a Mother's Day gift for my wife, so we were extremely disappointed when the CD player didn't work. Amazon sent me a new one within days and the new one works fine. It looks nice and sounds good. I just hope it lasts. I'm always leery of a company that makes products, especially electronics, that I have to return."
1,this thing is a joke,"Some things you should know that Amazon doesn't list: the two speakers are on the side, not the front, and they are only 3W. That's right, 3W. Hardly enough power for the smallest room. Also, it's powered by a ""wall wart"" AC adapter ... no decent stereo would be. It's made in China, big surprise. The ""wood grain"" is actually some sort of plastic coating, applied over plastic or cardboard. For $15 at a garage sale, it might be tolerable, but $95? Also, it makes a click noise through the speakers when you forward to another track. Whoever designed this atrocity should be embarassed. I'm embarassed at myself for buying it, I just want to save you the trouble of sending it back like I did."
3,Old time radio listening,"Nice little unit. The big disappointment was the fact that the sound comes out of either side, not the front. If you have ever seen an old photo or film showing people listening to their radio during the 30's or 40's, they are not listening to the sound coming out the sides of their radio."
5,Exactly what we were looking for!!,This radio has the old time look and feel with the new technology. The sound is smooth and full and the look is classic!! The only draw back is the LED screen for the CD is too bright. It should be more hidden for antique effect.
3,It's OK for a copy,"To bring nostalgia for a bygone era into your home, it is better to buy real antiques!, rather than knock-offs of the original!"
2,Poor Quality,"I was very disappointed with this retro radio. It looks great but the quality appears cheap. When I first set it on a table, the radio would not sit level. The rubber pieces on the bottom were not all the same size. The sound quality was not that good in my opinion. It was also disappointing that it cannot read mp3 files on a cd as most modern ones can. I returned this radio and I would not recommend this one."
3,CD/Radio/Disappointed:,Poor reception with certain local stations which I have not saw the past 20 years with our technology. Not haapy with this product.
2,Bad FM reception,My 15 year old radio gets better reception. I am still using that one. Do not buy. Huge waste of money
3,Disappointing reception,"The radio works well enough for the two or three strongest local stations, but poor selectivity leaves many stations with too much fuzzy noise. FM should have a good clean signal."
2,Read the description carefully...,"Ordered this item for my husband's birthday and was really disappointed when it arrived. Although the radio appears wooden, it is not- and glaringly so. It was also much smaller than expected - check those dimensions!- and appears to have been poorly soldered as it works only intermittently. Luckily, my electrical contractor husband looks on this cheerfully as a problem to be solved, but I, as the gift giver, see it as shoddy workmanship."
4,Watch it on the radio!,"I am pleased with my purchase of the Crosley CD Cathedral radio. My main ambition was to find a radio with the Cathedral style to fit in my personal apt style. It has a CD player, which has good sound. The sound quality is not 100% but I did not expect it to sound like a Bose system. The AM/FM radio has good sound. My only negative comment is that whomever designed this particular radio did not think very much about the placement of the buttons on the front but the instructions did help me. It is a beautiful, wooden Cathedral radio and so far I am glad that I made the purchase. It arrived very quickly and I did not spend extra for S&H. It was here 3 days before Christmas! I do have 2 Bose systems but they are about 15 years old and are not working very well. With the economy being what it is, I think the Crosley is a good purchase. I purchased the radio per the Amazon.com system, which I try to do more & more."
4,Crosley Cathedral Radio/cd,The radio reception is great. I do wish it had more then a single CD slot. I love the look of it.
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE,"A one star rating is too much for this piece of garbage. As soon as I opened the box I put in a CD and it wouldn't read it. The only reason I bought it was to play CD's. So not only did I pay $150.00 for something that doesn't work, in order to ""hopefully"" get my money back I had to pay another $54.00 to ship it back to Amazon! I WILL NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON AGAIN!"
3,Interesting subject,"I bought this book because of the series ""Most Haunted"" and liked the professional manner that Derek Acorah portrayed in the series. I liked this book because it was about his life and his ideas of life after death.Even thought I am not interested in becoming a sensative, I felt that I could use the meditation techniques. BUT I felt that it was dangerous if a person did continue to follow directions in the book to channel spirits etc. Not everyone is as grounded as Derek to use this gift.Overall, the writing in almost half of the book is not professionally done. I had a hard time keeping interest in it because of it. However the other half was written well and I wondered if Derek's co-auther had written these segments."
5,Great Product Worked Perfectly,The product worked great and sloved my issue of having the power supply at the bottom of the computer case while the connector to the motherboard was at the top. Great price too.
2,Neither Love Nor Rockets,"As a huge fan of Jaime Hernandez's work, I never really 'got' that of his brother Gilbert, and generally ignored his sections in the comics. The artwork seemed sloppy and unattractive, the stories seemed a touch sophomoric - relentlessly and earnestly beating us over the head with obvious truths in P.C.-themed narratives. Perhaps all that could be forgiven if there was some warmth or humor at the core of Gilbert's world, but there seems instead to be an atmosphere of nastiness. He loves to use (and show) brutality to make a point, and the characters don't have any empathy with each other. In summary, avoid and concentrate instead on the awesome stuff from Jaime."
4,"Well made, fits well, but small","This will do what we're after, which is a sling bag to carry a small camera, small bottle of bug spray, ID, smartphone and keys while doing a one hour hike at the local park. We like to wear either shorts or warm ups while fast walking and waist bags aren't fun and using pockets not an option for that much stuff. This does it.BUT, it is quite small. The model they used for this picture must have been quite petite."
2,Very small!,"It is clearly well made, substantial, and protective. But not practical - why have such big bag overall when only a pocket size camera will fit in the compartment? Does not fit fugi x10 with lens hood, which is not big at all. Also, it is black - based on the picture, I thought it would be lighter. Disappointed - it is going back."
3,"Nice, but too small for me.","I could live in Colombia clothing, with Kata Bags carrying all my stuff.Wanted to get this for shooting stills and video on two cameras on a media mission trip. Needed a bag to do quick swaps between the two smaller cameras. A Sony Handycam, fitting in my palm, and a mid size mega zoom point and shoot.This bag is very well made, with several handy pockets and could work as a waist bag just as well, but only big enough for a larger rectangular point and shoot, nothing with a lens sticking out. The girl they show wearing the bag must be about 4foot tall...Great bag, but a bit too small...I have two of their other bags, one that will hold a 13"" laptop, and another for a 19"", both great!"
5,Been High So Long,"Charles Reisen has rummaged back into the sixties and seventies to write a surprisingly intelligent and stylish novel about a thinly disguised himself version of himself. A must read for class of '67 Columbia High School people who want to pick out what's recognizable from what is made up (just as we do with the Sopranos, where the Lincoln Tunnel is real but not the route through Elizabeth to Verona). I particularly like the description of medical school in Dublin in the 70's, where the local girls would say they needed some coffee to go to sleep, but the insider's account of the '68 Chicago riots also has the ring of truth. There's a touch of Richard Farina in the Cornell portions and a bit of Philip Roth in the old neighborhoods of Essex Country. Much distress to this reader when the hero Carl is murdered by an envious writer. Reisen is surprisingly good on the politics of the era, from the wise guys at SDS to the hoodlums of the IRA. Check it out."
1,Physician-Writer :Heal Thyself,Unless you are a neonatologist from Dublin forget about this book. It is a stream of concsiousness rambling autobiography of EVERY detail of one person's perhaps exciting life. It requires megadoses of caffeine (or cocaine?) to keep up with the dialogue. Plot line? There is none. Some sentences and even paragraphs are interesting but so far buried in forgettable minutiae that it is barely worth the time. Many physicians feel so entitled that they want to think us mere mortals hang on their every word....we DO NOT!
2,Cheap but functional,"This is a cheap DVD with all the basic functions. Works okay! However, get something else if you are looking for a high quality system."
4,"Great Player, Terrible Remote Control","I bought this unit after I had a problem with some other brands while trying to play foreign language (specifically Indian) DVDs. This unit had no problems playing all of the 'problem' DVDs. I do not like the remote control though. It needs too many keystrokes to access most of the features, and you have to coordinate between pressing different keys on the remote and looking at the on screen display to see where it is in the menu system. I also like the 'upgradeable' feature, where the firmware can be updated onsite by running a special CD from Phillips. I have not tried it yet.However, overall a great unit. I would buy it again, if I had to."
5,Very Nice System,"I bought this system today and I am very impressed with what I got for under $200. The picture quality and sound are amazing. I tested out my only 2 DVDs (Jaws and The Sixth Sense) and they run great. So if you want a good, but affordable machine, buy this one now!"
5,4 years and still love it,"I bought this player 4 years ago and at the time it was one of the top players. It's built quality feels so much better than the current generation players which are exclusively made of plastic unless you spend at least $500. The player has never rejected a disc, never frozen or made any kind of error even with the worst rented dvds. I've always been a great Philps fan and as long as they keep making products like this one I will always remain one."
1,Avoid at all cost!!!!,"After minimal use, the DVD player did not work. Although able to recognize audio CDs, it failed to recognize any DVDs, ejecting them after attempting to read the data. I bought a lens cleaning disc for $10, thinking the laser had to be cleaned. Still, no DVDs played. After calling customer service, they told me there was little I could do since the product was no longer under warranty. In addition, I was told that no Philips authorized retailers would be able to repair it. So, after such minimal use, my DVD player is simply a CD player.Now that DVD players are a little more advanced, playing MP3 CDs and DVD-R, do not fall back on the Philips DVD711 because it may be the most inexpensive. You'll end up having to buy another DVD player anyway."
2,Horrible VCD Support,"This player is great if you just want it to play DVDS. But if you bought it for the use of VCDS watch out. Homeburned vcds have problems on this player. Some play fine, some are only in black and white. If it played VCDS perfectly this would be a perfect and cheap player, but it does not."
1,Don't expect it to last or for Philips to stand behind it!,I read all the great reviews and I bought this DVD player for my fiancé last year for Christmas. We were moving and didn't even take it out of the box until March. We're busy people so I'd say we watch about 3 movies a month on it... If you're going to buy a Philips make sure to get the extended warranty or go with a good brand like Sony.
5,The Saga Continues,This great saga continues in page turning excitement! Jaime and Claire combine a rich passion and love of life that makes you feel that you are there with them.
4,Voyager,Very good. Hard to put down. Interesting ending. Characters constantly getting into sticky situations. Looking forward to reading next book in series.
4,Another bonanza read by Diana Gabaldon,Fans like me will love this novel as much as the previous ones in this series. As close to perfection as it gets in historical and adventurous romance. Already dreading the end of the series. I wish Jamie and Claire could go on forever.
5,on the edge of my seat,The Voyager will keep you turning the pages. It is very good. Must read the whole series.
4,Voyager,I really like Diana Gaboldon's books about Scotland and have read many of them. This was just another good example
5,Another great book,This is yet another great book in the Outlander series. Thank you so much Diana Gabaldon - I love all your books.
4,voyager (outlander),"excellent writer, already read previous 2 books of this serie, would love to read the next to continue..very interesting story"
4,Voyager,I just love the Outlander series. It is really hard to put them down...even to go to sleep!Voyager is not quite as enthralling as the first two books. Too many unbelievable things occur. But it is still good and a must read to be able to go on to the next book.Thank you to the auther for her wonderful imagination. Such a talented writer.
5,Outlander,"I have totally enjoyed reading the Outlander series. I am on my 3rd book,look forward to many more, and will be saddened at the end of the adventure."
3,XXX rated,"Just not as good as the first two books. Too much sex and not enough substance disappointed! I really missed the historical research of the 'outlander' and ""Dragonfly in amber"" works."
4,voyager,I've not read anything from this author before but have had friends rave about her series. it's been very un-put-downable and I'm racing through the books.
4,The first 300 pages are fantastic!,"After reading Outland and Dragonfly in Amber, I couldn't wait to read this third installment! What happens 20 years later? Well, guaranteed, you won't be able to put the book down, as it summarizes the lives of Jamie and Claire during their 'hiatus'. I thought the book would drag, with the two being separated, but it was even more compelling to see how they carried on with their lives. Not to mention that you can't WAIT to see what happens when they meet up again. Unfortunately, after they finally reunite, it drags a bit...there's little subplots that keep you entertained, but it's nothing compared to the joy you'll experience when you read the first half. A good read, and I'm looking forward to Drums of Autumn...."
2,Lovin' Jamie and Claire to death...,"After reading the first three books in the Outlander series, I have to say I am absolutely fed up with the whole thing with Jamie and Claire. Nothing ever seems to resolve in their relationship. It's always hanging by a thread. This book in particular had a lot of repetition of minor details which is also annoying. In my opinion it took way too long to describe a teeny bit of action."
2,A Big No.,"I liked the first book in this series, really enjoyed the second book, but I had a really hard time getting through ""Voyager"". There were way too many mini-stories in this novel, way too many characters, and a lot of the story didn't sit well with me at all. I enjoyed the beginning (that's where the 2 stars come from), which was set in the 1960s, but the book dragged on and on and on. I thought I would never get through it. I'm afraid that this one may have convinced me not to continue through the series."
5,Amazing,"I love this author, I love this book, I love everything about the Outlander series!! Def must read the series!!"
4,I wish I could marry a scotsman!,"Have been getting into these historical romances lately, and I have to say, I'm really likin this one! Although its the 3rd in a series of 6, all weighing about 6 lbs a piece, I think I have the summer booked! (lame, i know!)I do like the humor in this series, though. It has actually made me laugh out loud, scaring my co-workers. Jamie, the leading man, is larger then life, and I go around with a horrible scottish accent after reading this for a while.The story goes that that in the 1940s, our lady Claire fell into a fairy hill in Scotland and was whooshed back in time to the 1740s, meets and falls in love with a big burley Scot, and they get into trouble everywhere they go. Witchcraft, history, si-fi, romance, passoin, Royality, Family fights... its all here baby!I wish i could marry a big burley Scot! (No, I'm stuck w/ my crabby German, I guess! Love u honey!!!)"
4,Really love Gabaldon's Series.,"I just finished re-reading Voyager, the third book in the series. Great book, good storyline, interesting characters, and it definitely holds up for a second read. Can't wait to read books four and five! My only complaints (and the reasons I gave it 4 stars rather than 5) were a) waaaay too many sex scenes. After a while, they all started melding into one and I skipped most of them - they didn't add to the story just pulled it to a grinding halt, and b) the book is TOO long. 800 pages or so is fine but when they get to be over 1,000 pages, it had better have a little bit more to it than this.With a good editor though, this book could have been amazing. Still, all in all, good job - and I plan on starting book four tomorrow."
5,Great Book,"Enjoying the book very much.Bought second hand book because of price. Even though it had been used, it was slightly used and in very good condition, for a used paperback."
2,Give us a break!,"Loving adventure stories and being of Irish/Scottish decent, I thought this a good fit for me. Well, I've read much better books and this one really drags. I don't need Claire and Jamie's sexual adventures portrayed for me, it's just cheap filler material. And agree with some of the other reviews, how'd Jamie become captain of that group anyway? The book seems a little like The Perils of Pauline."
3,Just so-so,"I know all of the other reviewers loved Voyager, however, I found the book to be uninteresting and unappealing. The first two novels in this series had depth and character in the events of history and the romace between Jamie and Claire. Voyager left me feeling like....oh well, big whoop they got back together. The story is disjointed and I found myself saying..okay...who cares. I expected more and I was disappointed."
5,Voyager,"I havent' enjoyed a novel this much in a long time. The series ""Outlander"" is an incredible journey into the history of the Scottish Highlands and it's culture. And the best storytelling ever!"
3,another one,"too many coincidences & sex scenes are rather amateurish and long. I felt like ""get on with it"" and skipped many pages."
5,The Voyager,"Best book of the ""Outlander"" series . . . for me. I have enjoyed this series many times and look forward to the next one."
4,Voyager book,The book was well paced and very interesting to read. The author kept my interest throughout the book and I would recommend it to anyone interested in historical fiction of 18th century Scotland
5,The best!,"Third in a continuing series, VOYAGER is my favorite thus far. There's nothing more I can say that hasn't already been said about this series, except to reiterate that you will wish this book was longer. There's really nothing more for me to say or do except speak-up for its rightful place in superb Literary Fiction.Catherine (...)"
3,"Not Diana's best, but still thumbs up","The story follows Clare back in her current time through her pregnancy and the growing years of her daughter until she's ready to venture back through the standing stones to spend the twilight of her life with the man who owns her heart. At the same time, we get a glimpse of Jamie's life in post-Jacobite Scotland as a war criminal and his struggles to survive after the Battle of Culloden and the disbanding of the clans.Although I love Diana Gabaldon, in this third of her Outlander series, the always-in-trouble hero is in trouble too often and the traveling left me with whiplash. She has a lot of ground to cover to get the hero and the heroine back together over a span of years and unfortunately, it was a rough ride. I would still recommend it, the meat of the story is well worth it and the detail is still good reading."
2,Poor in comparison to the first and second books.,The whole scenario was annoying and far-fetched with the jewels. The reunion of the two lovers was touching. But everything was ruined by the movement of the storyline setting to the caribbean island. It was just utterly ridiculous and bored me to tears with the whole thing. Did not like this one at all for those reasons.
4,Stll love the story,Jamie a Pirate! I love this series and love the dynamic between Clair and Jamie. I liked how they come to the new world and how they reconnect after so many years and pick up right where they left off. A beautiful story.
4,Not up to the level of the rest of the series,"In all, this book was very, very good, but not quite on a par with the rest of the series. It seemed to me that the characters were acting against their former natures - doing things they wouldn't do. In all, I do recommend it, and not just because you won't be able to follow the next book. Some of the scenes are breathtaking, and the writing is superb."
3,good read,Diana Gabaldon is a good story teller -good writer - not so much -However her characters have non-stop adventures that keep the reader turning pages -If she used fewer and less extensive details of the love-making and fewer instances of physical injuries to the male character it would have been more believable -I kept reading the series just to see what she would come up with next!
2,Dinna Trouble Yourself,"So, OK... I admit that I liked Outlander and Dragonfly... but Voyager was just ludicrous. But after slogging my way through Voyager, I feel complete with the series. I realize that this book is supposed to be over-the-top action and people admire it because the lovers aren't in their 20's. But Gabaldon over-uses phrases and all judgements about people are based on what their eyebrows are doing. The setting of the various boats they are in are claustrophobic and Claire is taken hostage so many times in the three books I have read, you would think that she would be used to it. If you want non-stop action, then go for it. But this is definitely a book for plot junkies."
5,Loved the Voyager (Outlander,"I spent time in Scotland this summer, which made me want to read novels with Scotland as a setting. The Voyager(Outlander) fit that need. This book and the series that follows was recommended to me by one of my tennis partners. In the process I have learned that others in my group have read the series and loved it as well.I will be reading the rest of the Outlander series."
4,"Consider this a bridge to ""Drums of Autumn""","I loved the whole Outlander series, but this book was my least favorite. It has many of the elements that I enjoyed in the other books -- historical detail, great characters, interesting plot twists. But. I was disappointed in the reunion between Claire and Jaime after 20/200 years of separation. The first thing he does is wet his pants (by sitting in something). Then they have a Keystone Cop-style set of adventures with fires, revenue agents, etc. I thought the Chinaman was silly. It got better later, though there were times I had trouble following what was going on -- and why. I did like the introduction of the teenage young Ian, another endearing character. Also liked getting to know Roger and Brianna better. And the next book gets much better."
2,Voyager Audiobook - Abridged version,"Cheated of the whole story, this is a version you do not want to own or listen to. After listening to the first two books in the unabridged version - narrated by a different person, this rapidly read, less than excellent version will leave you wishing you hadn't ruined the book in this way. Diana Gabaldon is an excellent author, that can tell a historical tale that has you gasping and looking for the next installment. This ABRIDGED version leaves too much of the story out and is read at a frantic pace, with little emotion. Don't waste your time or your money on this one."
2,Not even half way through,"I have to keep reading, because I started and have to know what happens. Like the 2nd book, I will skip through pages. How many more to go?"
3,The third book,"After reading the first two in the series, I am about to sit down to this one. The cliffhanger ending of ""Dragonfly In Amber"" makes me want to pick it up right away - however, after reading here about Jamie's life after Claire returns to her own time, I'm having second thoughts. Can someone tell me - how traumatic is it? I can't believe that he would be with someone else, even if she DID leave! How is this dealt with? If he falls in love with someone else, or goes to someone else without feeling remorse, I don't think I'll be able to take it. Can the reader manage to forgive him? Please spare me the emotional truma if at all possible!Also, I have to agree with the reader who commented that Claire missed her chance to set the record straight with Jack Randall in ""Dragonfly"". I wanted to shake her! Come on! Jack may have had Jamie's body in one depraved episode, but that's nothing compared to his soul and the love he and Claire share. Just no competition..."
1,These Books Get Worse and WORSE,"I liked OUTLANDER. I found the next book in the series, DRAGONFLY, to be a bore. It's wholly flashback. But mostly it's too longwinded. By the time I got to VOYAGER, my patience ran out. Good writing comes from revising and cutting those precious pages. I didn't bother with DRUMS because she's lost me as a reader. I wish she'd kept the style (freshness) she had with Outlander."
4,Unbelieveable!,"This third book of the Outlander series will not disappoint fans of Jaime and Clare Fraser and leads us into new characters for the next generation of timeless romance! Finally, they are together for what appears to be always; There are at least three more books, so what will happen next? I gave it four stars instead of five b/c it took them FOREVER to get to the 'promised land' of the New World. No real couple would make it through some of the scenarios that Diane envisioned, but then, isn't that why we love them and her? Read on!"
4,Slightly Harlequinesque... yet worth the read,"The first two books were utterly compelling and impossible to turn off my kindle. This one is not quite in the same league as the first two but nevertheless riveting. My biggest complaint would be the recycling of all the characters. Well I think Jaime would say it best: ""Christ Sassenach, who do ye think Gabaldon's going ta be resurrectin next? The entire Highland Army?"""
4,"As good as the first in the series, better than the second book.","Escapism, adventure, easy reading, and spicy - good for a long trip or snippet reading when you can steal time. Recommended for adult women with a healthy sense of imagination. The romantic aspect appealed to me less than the adventure and historical aspects. Not particularly well written or profound, rather for busy women who like to read to escape - this is a great series. The first book was best, the second slightly feeble, but this, the third, picks up steam and the content is varied and captivating. I want to visit Scotland now!"
5,Historical Romance Novel,I have read other books in the Outlander series and this book offers a good deal of history as well as adventure and romance.
5,Great book in a great series,"I have read this series many times, so that my hardcopies have fallen apart and I am now collecting them on the Kindle! This book in the series continues the superb story telling of Diana Gabaldon where she chronicles the lives of Jamie and Claire. If you like historical fiction with a strong cast of characters, mystery, adventure and a bit of romance, this book (and the series!) may be for you."
5,Excellent read,Excellent read. The third book in the Outlander series keeps you wanting more. I would highly recommend. Great story. Cannot say enough about the Outlander books
3,"Still good, but...","Fantastic author, but book one and two were so fantastic, that I'm a little disappointed with book three. I had a terrible time putting down her first two books, but it hasn't been the same with this one."
2,it was ok.,I enjoyed the book until it got to the ending. It seemed as though she tried to get too much material into it. What was with the voodoo stuff? What was the purpose of the minister who ended up a serial killer? Too much for me. I couldn't wait to finish it and not in a good way. I'm hoping the rest of the books will be better.
2,Supremely disappointing.,"I am a huge fan of Diana Gabaldon and the Outlander series, however, this installment came up grievously short. While the Jamie and Claire reunion was great, the rest of the book had too much going on and was too hard to follow, she just went a bit too far. Be that as it may, I'm still looking forward to the next book."
3,"Not bad, but not quite as good as the first two","Voyager was an interesting addition to the series begun with Outlander. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite in the same league as Gabaldon's previous novels. To put it bluntly, this book loses some of the ""believeability"" of the first two books. There are simply too many plot twists that come flying in from left field. This makes much of the book feel strained-- as though Ms. Gabaldon knew she had to come up with SOMETHING for Claire and Jamie, but she wasn't sure what. Still, it was entertaining, and I can't say that I didn't enjoy reading it. I suppose I was just spoiled by the excellence of the first novels in the series.One other thing, this is kind of a non-sequiter: I hope the next novel(s) by Diana Gabaldon have a bit less flagellation in them. Someone always seems to be getting hit with a whip, belt or razor strop. Maybe I'm way off here, but the whole punishment-thing seems to show up in all her books. Hmm."
3,Missing pages,"I love the book but there were about 100 pages in the wrong spot on the book! There was also pages missing altogether. I'm to sure why, but I was disappointed."
5,Master storytelling.,"I would recommend this series to anyone who loves a good series that doesn't get boring. Sometimes, i wish the chapters were shorter because I can't stop reading until I get to the end on the chapter and I need to go to sleep."
5,"It's the best, spellbinding escape reading ever!","I have read all of the books in this series, and have foundeach one to be more compelling than the last. The attentionto historical accuracy is refreshing and each book has beenworth the wait. I look forward to ""Drums of Autumn""."
2,Something's quite different,"After reading the first 2 books in the series, I was overjoyed to sit down and delve back into the lives of Jamie and Claire. How disappointed I was as I got further and further into the book. I didnt like the changes that were made to the characters, and at points, I actually was disgusted with them. This book pales greatly in comparision to the others."
2,Getting annoyed with the characters,"Basically speaking, this book is not as good as the first two by far. A lot of the excitement and freshness of Jamie and Claire's relationship is not there, and I found myself getting annoyed with many aspects of the book. Overall I would recommend this book for anyone who simply loved the first two, but do not expect the same power from this novel. I would not recommend this book to anyone who thought Dragonfly in Amber was just okay. Reading this book will not add anything special for you."
3,The first 300 pages are fantastic!,"Voyager, the third book in the New World Series (or Outlander series, depending on what your preference is) is pretty enjoyable. The first 300 pages are, in particular, quite enjoyable....I couldn't put it down. After that, however, it slows down, and becomes somewhat dull. Regardless, I'm looking forward to book number four, but didn't enjoy this one as much as books one and two. Still worth a read, and still more enjoyable than most historical romance-type books."
2,Horrible headache and stomach unease,I love Now products but for what ever reason every single time I take this Omega I get a nasty headache and stomach unease. I tried it 3 times and on the third time I gave up. No other Omega product that I've tried has ever done this to me. Very disappointed.
4,No burps!,"I trust Now brand. These have no fishy burps. They are a reasonable price, and although they aren't the best or designer Omega-3 out there, I have been using them several years and would recommend them."
3,Review,"Solid information which not covers the basic development lifecycle and it's components but also the bigger picture e.g. predictive analyses, reflective metrics, customer satisfaction measurement, etc. A good read, informative and it won't scare a novice. Recommended."
4,"Remember those ""B sides"" of 45's you thought were great?","This is a collector's CD for those growing up in the 1950's who turned a hit rock 'n 'roll ""45"" over to hear the ""B-side"". ""Fabulous Flips"" is the only way to hear some of these songs again (unless you saved all those singles). Some flips were as great as the original hit, but many were EVEN better. Yes, it's nostalgic, but the high quality of the sound and the new availability of these recordings created by defunct rock labels, makes this particular collection unique. Technically, ACE records (UK) used the original masters or a pristine ""needle-drop"". OUTSTANDING!"
5,Inspirational Masterpiece,"The collaborators of this CD have done a masterful job of blending famous artists, news reports, comments, and speeches of the participants of this historic event. I have continued to listen to this CD long after its initial release in 2001. I think it should be re-released on each anniversary of 9-11. It is one of the most inspirational albums I have ever heard. It comes highly recommended."
5,Delighted!,"I was wary ordering on-line, but despite my concerns I am so happy with my purchase. I had never hung anything that would hold so much weight but with the directions it was easy - even though I totally recommend two people. Looks beautiful and I love it every time I look at it, especially in a space starved kitchen where I didn't have room for a real ceiling hung rack. Very happy with my purchase."
4,Decent double filter,"It is a straight forward item. It uses two standard filters. My plumber had no trouble on installation. If you have done some checking, a lot of filters look good, are cheaper (a bit), or are a lot more expensive. This one bridges those gaps. It also has a high gallon per minute rate..which is critical for a whole house filter. A lot of those posted are not capable of being mounted for whole house. We have had no problems with g.p.m. since installation."
3,Good price for what you get,"The filter is nice and does what is promised. When my new filter arrived it was sent without a filter cartridge. So I would guess this explains the better price from amazon vs Home depot. When I was shopping and comparing filters, both Home Depot and Amazon showed this filter complete with a cartridge. So, amazon got the balance of the money I saved with the replacement cartridges I just ordered. Keep this in mind when ordering this product from amazon."
4,The Rating Actually is 4.5 Stars,"The main reason for the purchase of this collection of music from the original series is the inclusion of excerpts from George Duning's beautiful score to ""The Empath."" His music for the episode is comparable to the melodies that he composed for the both the installment ""Metamorphosis"" and the feature film ""Picnic.""Fred Steiner's contributions for ""By Any Other Name"" and ""Mirror, Mirror"" are further examples of why ""Trek,"" like no other show at the time, so effectively intertwined music in its storytelling.Thankfully, only a snippet of the score to ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" is heard. When listening to the entire CD, I skip this one entirely.Overall, however, ""Volume Two"" is a worthy successor to the first on the Varese-Sarabande label."
3,Not what it used to be.,"Like some others, I have the older version. The gel was soft, comfortable, and still gave me great support, so I was excited to get another one. But in this new version, the gel is really firm, which I personally don't prefer. The size is reduced a lot, so it does not elevate my wrist high enough to feel really comfortable. The surface still feels smooth though. I don't understand why they changed such a great product. Overall, it's an okay product but I would really prefer the old one over this one.Update:So I've tried the wrist rest from Allsop called ""ALLSOP Small Ergoprene Gel Wrist Rest, Black 30211."" And it's much more comfortable than the Fellowes one. I've also tried the 3M wrist rest, which is also very firm. I highly recommend the one from Allsop."
4,Comfy but a tad small,Overall a nice product but with a larger monitor a tad small.Takes some getting use to. Good gripers on base doesn't slide much.I would recomend this product.
4,Works well.,"having experienced the development of sore on my wrist when using a mouse without the wrist rest, discovering this has brought me relief from that."
4,Good product,This a good product. It is very comfortable and easy on the wrist. If I have one complaint it is that the pad itself is a little small.
3,Not as good as the original if you have a corded mouse,"I use a corded mouse and the cord keeps getting caught in the container of the pad. In the older model, the pad and the container were flush. In this model, the pad is slightly below the container. My mouse keeps getting s tuck. If you have a cordless mouse, you should be fine."
3,Mouse area is too small and wrist rest too firm,If you like a hard surface to put your wrist on this is for you. But after a while my wrist starts to become numb and in order to continue working I have to lift my wrist off of the pad or try to reposition it.
1,Totally Bogus. The real good stuff is missing.,"I'm sorry I bought it. I would have been ahead to buy some NEW AGE recording. Whereas the movie soundtrack, which was what I thought I was getting, was absolutely haunting, this Cd reminded of the old Peggy Lee recording, ""Is That all There Is""."
1,The good stuff is missing,"Unfortunately, the most memorable music from the movie is not included on the CD. This borders on fraud. What is included is rather boring."
4,Lovely yet missing one song,"I found this soundtrack haunting the first time I saw the film and have enjoyed it for years. I always wondered why, though, they left out the opera song, which was so important to the film's mood and theme. I still love this compilation and it is gorgeous stuff. Jarre at his best."
2,"Not as good as the others, pretty boring actually","I couldn't wait for this book to come out. I love Jane Green's books, but this one was a dud. Not at all as funny, engrossing, or captivating as the others. I put my toddler to bed, poured a glass of wine and curled up w/ the book - and was hugely disappointed. It's ok, nobody's perfect. Still love her books."
3,Good Book,I did enjoy this book. I was a little disappointed with the ending being so summed up but other then that i enjoyed it & think Jane Green is great!
2,Boring,"This book started off interesting but I kept waiting for it to go somewhere and it never did. It was overall boring and repetitive. It is well written for a fast read, but overall no real plot."
3,one amongst many,"Having read all of Jane Green's books I must admitt I didnt find this one nearly as interesting as the previous ones, however I did enjoy it and as usual it is light reading."
3,Just So-So,"A so-so book in my opinion, not horrible, but certainly not the greatest book I've ever read. The writing style was different, and came across as a bit amateur to me. I sometimes had to reread paragraphs to figure out who was actually saying them since the point of view seems to change every paragraph. The story itself was interesting enough. I think Alice was a sad creature, and Joe a complete jerk."
1,Find another chick-lit,"I usually love chick-lits but this one was annoying to read. I had no sympathy for any of the characters. I couldn't stand how oblivious Alice was and how Joe kept on with his infidelity without even a bit of remorse. I managed to finish reading the whole book and happy now that I can move on to a better book. But I mean, if you're a girl that enjoys reading about people being unfaithful and reading the details about it, then this book would suit you."
4,Good read,"I got about 1/3rd into this book and thought I didn't like it. I was really having a hard time with the main character changing who she is for her cheating husband. That theme was dragged out a bit too long for my taste. However, her husband's cheating is discovered at his job and he is transferred to New York. There his wife starts to change and begins to acquire a ""real"" side to her personality. This is when the book picks up for me and I couldn't put it down. Jane Green is a good writer; she pulls you right in."
2,Jane Green - this isn't your best!,"I loved Jane Green's Jemima J. I loved her other books as well, although none compared to Jemima J. This book, however, was not up to par with the other ones. I bought the book at 10:30 am, forced myself through the first 73 pages, and returned the book at 12:30. I have never returned a book because I didn't like it before, but this one drove me to it. I could not identify with any of the characters, and the spinelessness of Alice made the book a chore to read. I have not lost faith in Jane Green's ability to write, and I will definitely pick up her next novel when it comes along, but this one was definitely not her best work. I gave it a two stars only because the writing style is still Jane's easy-to-read style."
3,Blah.....,"Jane Green's other novels have all been great reads, but this one was a disappointment. The characters are relatively bland, and the plot predictable. What annoyed me about this book is that none of the characters actions are explained very well. Why does Alice try so hard to please her husband when later in the book she does a total 180 late on in the book? And we see very little evidence of love between Alice and Joe to begin with, so it's difficult to see why they are married. Leave this one on the chelf, or get it free from the library. Better yet- forget it altogether and pick up any of Green's other, much better works with likeable characters, like Bookends or Jemima J."
1,Boring Main Character,"I was looking for a good read, but I couldn't finish this one. The main character is just too boring to care about. I mean, if she's willing to spend years with a philandering husband in a dissatisfactory marriage, why should I want to read about it? There wasn't enough conflict or plot here to engage me and, coupled with an doormat protagonist, I just couldn't be bothered."
1,Doormat Becomes Desperate Housewife,"I'm not sure what irritated me more: the fact that the book's protagonist allowed herself to become her husbands fantasy woman, sacrificing her business, her cats, her fantasies of her wedding, her fantasies of her home, her Christmas tree, and her comfortalbe wardrobe...Or the fact that once they move to CT, she pretends to be this down-to-earth chick living in ""the country"" like she's in the simple life, but in fact, is living in suburban CT housewife hell, complete with SUV and expensive casual wardrobe. Anyone who lives in or near the barely-fictionalized Fairfield County-area of CT knows that it's hardly the country haven described in the book, but a bastion of snobbery and pretentiousness. I can't accept the new Alice as down to earth, but rather just a different brand of snob."
2,Mildly enjoyable,"Like many other reviewers, I found this (my first book by Jane Green) to be a mildly entertaining beach read but ultimately disappointing. It was spoiled for me by Green's rather wooden style of writing, flat, unconvincing dialogue and one-dimensional characters. A pity, because I thought the author did an excellent job of creating a sense of place and I could tell - even though I didn't enjoy this book as much as I'd hoped - that she could do much better. I look forward to reading her other novels."
3,Mediocre,"I enjoyed Jane Green's earlier books a great deal, but her later books are focused on more domestic issues, and are as about as interesting as an afternoon in the 'burbs. In this case, I found the lead character to be a total pushover, and felt more annoyed than sympathetic toward her."
1,Truly a disappointment!!!,I really wanted to like this book but I couldn't like the characters. Oh I got that she just didn't really want to know but come on how could she not make him suffer some. I so wanted to see him hurt! I wanted him to realize that he can't do these things to people and expect to walk away unscathed!!! It really was slow and there were a lot of descriptions of him with the others. I suppose that in the end she was just totally indifferent to him but . . . well I wanted to see him down!!!
1,Cheated,"Thanks for the heads up. I feel Jane Green, her publisher and Amazon are trying to cheat loyal readers. If I could searched inside the book, then I would know it is a rip-off. This happened to me with a Joanna Lindsey novel and I haven't read her since. Let the buyer beware."
2,read backwards,"if you read Jane Green backwards, starting with this boring book and ending with say, Jemima J, you'll think Jane Green really improved with experience, and her novels got so much better over the years.In fact, they're just getting worse.The chick-lit author's pattern continues:Book 1 single and searchingBook 2 boyfriended and in a panicBook 3 married life- amusing ""adjust-to-mishaps"", but lovey-doveyBook 4 married life- bad, bad bad- divorce? (baby added at page 192 to cement outcome)Book 5 older, wiser, staying, but really boring now."
4,Great,"I absolutely loved this book, I read it a few years ago and it was the first I ever read by Jane Green but thoroughly enjoyed it."
3,"I love Jane Green, but this one was disapointing","I absolutely love Jane Green's books, but I was disapointed with this one. The plot line seems great cheating husband in the suburbs fresh from London, although I must agree with some of the other reviews on the connection between the author/former owner of the house; All I can say is WHY? Some of it was just completely unbelievable. Alice has this great catering business and she gives it all up to stay at home and do absolutely nothing, on top of that she will agree to move to New York at the drop of a hat.Another thing, what is up with the dog trainer just up and moving across the world, but not telling Alice he was there???Jane Green has had much better books, this one is a quick and easy read, good for a slow saturday when you are out of fresh reading material. I do worry, at the end of the book Green seems to give the impression that she might continue with this story. I really hope she decides to start a new one.Kim in Austin Texas"
4,My First Jane Green Novel,This was my first Jane Green novel and I really enjoyed it! I have since finished Jemima J and am now working on Babyville. The wit and charming style of Green's writing makes it impossible to put the book down. I personally can identify so strongly with the main characters in all of her books and I love that. I did like Jemima J best of the two and I can't wait to be able to say that I've read all of her work. If you're considering this book it's an excellent first Jane Green novel or one to add to the list of what you've already finished and it reads very quickly.
1,What a disappointment! ... not worth your time or money,"I have long been a fan of Jane Green books and I was counting the days until the release of this book. After 160 pages I could not take reading another page! It is completely stereotypical, cliche, redundant and its plot goes no where. I did however enjoy Mr. Maybe and Jemima J... definately pass on this one, it's trash."
3,Not bad,"I, like many of the readers before me, enjoy Jane Greeen's work. However, I do have to agree that this book is not very deep. Joe is a complete jerk and I kept wishing and wondering why Alice just didn't pop in to Manhattan to see what he was up to. That would have been a great twist. Also, there is no way and girlfriend would take another girlfriend's ex-boyfriend regardless of what she says. Emily seems to do this pretty willingly however at the end. There are just too many ""duh"" moments to make this a classic Jane Green read."
2,"A light read, nothing more","This book tackles some pretty heavy subjects -- illusion vs. reality, love vs. passion, the enduring nature of friendship. But it handles them in a rather superficial way. I know women who have dealt with the issues Alice faces, yet I never felt she was a flesh and blood woman. Likewise Joe really never came to life for me. And I wish the author had actually shared more of Rachel Danbury's life story and work with us. This feels like junk food. It's enjoyable while it lasts, but it doesn't stick with you."
3,Shockingly Disappointing,"After reading Babyville I was ready to add Jane Green to my ""Must Read"" authors list....after reading To Have and To Hold I crossed her off. I am utterly disappointed by this point which has great backbones. The story line is easy to follow but the book is filled with endless narration. The ending is quite abrupt and leaves nothing to the imagination. Which if you like finishing a novel and having ""closure"" then this may be the perfect read for you. I loved the character Alice but really wish she would have ""caught on"" sooner to her husbands philandering ways."
3,Not Jane Green's best,"Hmmm...I go back & forth with Jane Green. In this case, I wasn't so thrilled with the novel. It is entertaining, I will give it that. But it is cheesy and predictable. And I had a hard time reading how the characters in NYC were going ""down"" to Connecticut....that would be ""up"" to Connecticut according to a map!!I am not giving up on Jane Green yet, though. I've read all her novels except for Straight Talking and this is only the 2nd one to get a so-so review from me."
2,"NOTE: ""Spellbound"" is ""To Have and To Hold""","When I saw this on Amazon I thought, ""Hey there's a Jane Green novel I haven't read before, or even heard of."" Turns out, I had read it. Called ""Spellbound"" in this UK edition, the American version was retitled ""To Have and to Hold"" but it is still the same story. So while this cover art is much better than the US version (in this graphic designers opinion) if you've already read the US version, you've already read this too!"
2,somewhere in the fair to poor range,"I bought this book while on vacation in London back in March (it's titled ""Spellbound"" in the UK- wierd!) Just finished reading it. I agree that it was pretty intereting 2/3 of the way through, but I definitely began to lose interest towards the end. I was rooting for Alice, but she became so DUMB about what was going on with her husband that it began to annoy me. As a married woman myself, it was hard to read some (ok many) scenes where her husband was cheating on her. Disturbing.I would suggest reading some of Green's other novels first, they are much better. Hope this helps."
2,disappointment,"I loved Mr. Maybe and Jemima J by Jane Green, so I thought I'll read her newest novel, which is titled Spellbound in UK. It's the story of Alice, and her husband, who's constantly cheating on her. Too many descriptions and the story is going too slow. And then, suddenly, Alice changes totally. This book really got me frustrated, annoyed, depressed, anything but to have a good time ! I forced myself to finish it, but I couldn't, because it was really too hard to continue until the end."
2,Not Jane Greens Best,I have been enjoying Jane Green books very much just recently. This had very mixed reviews but I tried it anyway. I could not sympathize with the heroine at all. She was utterly spineless and I was never really convinced of her love for Joe and obviously not his love for her. I really thought the mystery surrounding the house would have more importance in the plot besides Alice living with a philandering man. I won't give up on you Jane.
1,Re-Title,"I hate when they re-title a book or put a new cover on it and trick us into buying it. Chances are, if you are an avid reader of said author and you see a new title or a cover you haven't seen before you are going to buy it! Get it home and whoa la! You've read it before! Such a bummer!"
1,Depressing,"I like a good ""chick lit"" book as much as the next girl, but this one was tough to get through. The heroine is just pathetic, constantly changing her ways to please her horrific (and cheating) husband. I know it's just a story, and certainly not the first to cover infidelity, but nothing about it drew me in. This was my first Jane Green read, and although some of her other works may be deserving, I'll likely pass on any more - there are too many other great books out there!"
2,"enjoyable, but.... jane green is slipping!","Having read all of Jane Green's books, I was disapointed by this one. Rather than bringing creative and fresh characters to life, Green has fallen back on stereotypes. There is no one in this book I would *want* to know in real life, and the book's plot is entirely predictable. Of course, all chick lit books go in the same direction, but this one is just flat as day-old champagne.What happened, Jane? : ("
3,not up to her usual standard,"i was frankly disappointed by this. most of green's writing is so tight and clever. this just seemed slack by comparison, not to mention the irritatingly downtrodden central character! grrrr!"
3,full of nothing,It looke d like a cute book but it was full of nothing and it was so predictable that I don't know why I continued to read it!!! The premise was good....but that was it!
4,Slow start.. but all in all a charming read,"I am a big fan of Jane Green's, and I have to say this wasn't the best book I've read by her. It started out very slow, and I almost lost interested in it, but once the book progressed out of London, the book began to take shape, and I found I could not put it down.Alice's situation is common to a lot of women,who married or not, find themselves in, and most women can relate to this book. It turned out to be a charming read."
4,Green delivers,"This book didn't have the most thrilling storyline but once again, Jane Green delivered with an entertaining, well-written book. I liked the main character even though she was a little wishy-washy and weak. I still found her endearing and Green brought to life both her life in London and Connecticut/NYC. The women in this story are really what make it worthwhile, a varied bunch that you could imagine being friends with."
5,My favorite Jane Green so far...,"The first of her work that I read was 'Mr. Maybe' and I had enjoyed that light, casual romp of chick lit. To Have and To Hold is much more sophisticated, darker, and more alive. Jane has the gift to convey human situations in a way that all of us can understand. Her ability to build a beautiful story of an often sad situation is intriguing. I would highly recommend this read, as well as other Jane Green novels. This one is much more than a light little chick lit romp. I look forward to Jane's next."
4,Excellent,"I enjoyed it very much, but i dig Mick's sound more with Blacktop and even the dirtbombs. They sounded insane at Maxwell's in hoboken. Tiny cramped space = perfect space for el rock n roll."
4,Nice Case Except For The Cover,"I've had the Grip Case for about 2 months and here's my take on it.Overall I very much like this case. I have large hands and it definitely makes it easier to hold and play. I like how the handles fold into the case to make it smaller. The rubber coating on the grips is nice too. I also like the fact you can store 3 games and an extra stylus.There are a couple of things I don't like. The case cover is flimsy and seams like it's easily breakable. Also once the case is opened there's nothing holding the DS in place. A good jolt can send your DS flying right out of the case.Despite those 2 downfalls I'm still giving the case 4 stars based on it's usefulness of protecting the DS, the grips, and extra storage.If you have large hands and find yourself having trouble holding a DS, this case can definitely help with that problem."
3,Tis ok but not that great,"The DS Lite does fit inside the grips snuggly, but there is nothing to hold the DS Lite inside the grips so it has a tendency to fall out if you hold the Grip case at an od angle. The plastic tops is pretty flimsy so it could break if not cared for very gently."
2,Disappointed,"Now that my son has broken our 2nd case in less than 2 months. I certainly see the need to have the Ninetendo DS in a case, but not this one. The clear plastic top breaks off very easily. We're trying another brand."
2,Only good for non-stylus games,"I'm not happy with this case. Yes the grips are nice if you like holding an xBox controller but there is no access to the power button. If you play a lot of stylus games than it just makes the DS heavier, rather than easier to hold. The case doesn't seem to be very protective either."
1,A pile of junk,I have this saw. You can't put any pressure on the saw because it will kick the breaker. It vibrates unbelievably. The threads on the vise screw got messed up the very first time I used it. I've only had it for a couple of years with little use and the motor burned out already. I'm looking to buy a new chop saw and it will not be a Dewalt.
2,Tough Love,"Someone should blow the whistle on these Dewalt Characters. This model is not even a D.I.Y. tool, the best thing I did is save the reciept and the box for returning every couple of months, use two blades up and replace the brushes, use six blades and it won't cut more than one stud or one piece of 3/4"" conduit. Time to return/exchange for the next one, and repeat. To the defense of Dewalt is that several other manufacturers have been the same and several of those were made for each other, change the color and decal. Poor work clamping and miter adjustments of any accuracy are not able to be done. This works fine if you want to cut a brick or two and a stud once in a while, steel over 1/8 inch is a load and results in brush/motor failure. You wonder why I own several, purely price. Save a little longer and buy a portable band saw and later a stand for it and enjoy."
1,Worst power tool I have ever owned!,"I bought this because I liked my brother's DW-874. Bad move. This thing is a piece of junk. The clamp is horrible, It comes loose, the screw striped out after 6 months. If you make 45 degree cuts the back of the clamp is so far back the blade can not cut all the way through the metal, to correct this you have to put an extra piece of material behind what you are cutting to space it out far enough to cut through. It vibrates no matter what you cut. I've used saws with less horse power ratings that have more power. It trips breakers all the time on circuits that don't trip when I use my 110v welder. If I had it to do over I would buy a hack saw!"
2,Not worth the high price,"I've had this for ~ a couple of years now. It's ok, and has decent power. It trips the ciruit breaker constantly when I try to cut through 1/4"" square though, which gets annoying. It'll cut angle or thin stuff pretty quickly though.But worst of all, is that weak miter clamp. First, it's hard to set it at the angle you want b/c you're never sure if you're exactly hitting the angle you want.. But when you do finally set it, after you tighten the work down, the whole clamp will move, and now you're at a different angle. Cheap!"
1,a SAD!!! peice of work!!,"I'm a dock builder that uses chop saws reguarly and I found this saw to be a JOKE!! It lug's down stalls out trips the breaker in the breaker box ( a 20 amp breaker using #10 wire at 15 feet long cord ) won't use all the blade like the old saws. WILL NOT cut a miter cut without angling off crooked it even cut the base of the saw itself, is how bad it angles off!! The saw acts like it has a mind of it's own. it works when it wants to. The only thing I have to say good about it is, the handle is more easier to grip being horisonatal. Other than that it would't make a good trot line anchor!!!!!"
1,burned up twice,"I bought the dewalt 871 14"" chop saw because I was told it would cut metal. It cuts thin walled stock, but it doesn't cut a 3"" mechanical tubing with 1/2"" wall or 3"" solid stock like promised. I could barely put pressure on the blade to keep it cutting. I don't feel like replacing the motor again."
4,Pretty Good Equipment,"I have given this chop saw some almost abusive use (Cutting 3"" schedule 40 pipe at 45 deg. angles). It cut the angles fine, but the thread that tightens the vice was damaged. That's the only weakness in the saw that I own. It performs very well cutting anything I've put through it so far (2"" 11Ga. square tube, 1/2"" bar stock, 3""X3"" X1/4"" angle, etc.). Other than the thread problem, I find it to be an excellent tool."
3,Mazda won't touch it,"I was wanting to replace this because I got oil all in my airbox, but Mazda wouldn't touch the thing because it's not an official mazda product."
4,"High flow air filter, perfect fit for RX-8",My car ran much better with these replaced on my Mazda RX-8.I like the fact that I can wash these once they get dirty.
1,Far Too Obtuse,"I am an advanced adult rider who is looking to refine the aids used in dressage. I found this book far to obtuse and inflated with 'chat' to be useful. The author expresses ideas such as 'lifting with the thighs' and 'bearing down', and certainly it is understood that there should be muscle tone and activity in these areas of the body. However, beyond expressing anecdotes of the miracles created by using these muscles there are no solid explainations. The promise of biomechanics leaves one to believe there will be explicit detail but instead the descriptions are more poetic. I lost patience halfway through the book."
1,Wordy,I am also an advanced adult rider and did not find this book useful at all. It is very wordy with not a single photograph. A ridiculous way of trying to impart information about dressage or any other riding discipline. Very prissy writing style perhaps favored in some circles on the other side of the pond.
5,a lot of twists and turns,"I've know about Tont Leung for awhile now and know that he is a superb chinese actor. He was the undercover cop in the movie ""Hardboiled"" with Chow Yun Fat. In this movie he is cool, as other reviewers have noted, he plays a corrupt cop. You really have to pay attention watching this movie. The little details such as phone numbers of a restaurant and the number written on a hand of a headless corpse. My favorite part is where the assasin tells Sam that he'll know what will happen in an hour, talk about suspense. This movie was made in 1998 is I'am not mistaken. The languages that are only available for this movie are cantonese and mandarin. The pace that the subtitles appear is a bit fast, becomes even more important because there is no wasted dialog in this movie. Longest nite is a bit violent, Sam likes to snap off fingernails as a form of torture and he is generally sadistic."
4,Nice set,"We love Corelle and needed to buy new - looked at lots of designs (almost went with Urban Red) but settled on this one. Liked the extra plate. Colors not the same from picture to real life. They are not grey/blue tone, they are brown-ish. Only issue I have is that on some of the plates the ""rings"" are off-center, mostly on dinner plate. The Lifestyle Corelle is thicker than original but I liked both."
1,Oops! Read if color concious,"The description on color lists black lines w/ gray, it is actually dark brown w/ tan. It is pretty, but if you are matching w/ black or gray save yourself some time and pick something else. Corelle is wonderful quality."
3,Pewter is not the name for this set,"I just ordered this set for my wedding because I love pewter and all things grey. I read the reviews that said it actually was more purple-ish or brown than grey. I admit I was sceptical and that's why I ordered them. Well, they were indeed kind of a light brownish color. I didn't see anything resembling grey/pewter/silver about them. I'm pretty dissappointed because I love pewter and am not so fond of brown. If you like brown tones, you'll probably be great with this set. But if you actually like pewter, DON'T ORDER IT!Corelle, change your description of these dishes. It's deceptive."
1,wildly broken in delivery,Usually break free product but SMASHED in Amazon delivery and then had to wait 4 weeks for credit.BOO!
1,"BEWARE! Not pewter, black or gray!!!","The description for these dishes is wrong! There is nothing Pewter, black or gray in color on them. The stripes are light and dark BROWN and the rest is a mottled BROWN."
3,Where's the Pewter????,We recieved our order of dishes today about a week earlier than expected!!! A great surprise! The color of these dishes are brownish/tan... Do not buy these if you are expecting them to look like the pictures.
2,Don't let the picture decieve you,"From the picture and the fact that this set is more expensive than the average Corelle set, I was expecting a really nice set of dishes that I could have for years, since Corelle is so durable. Unfortunately, I hated the set so much that I returned them all. The print on the border is made with a dot-matrix printer, and if you don't know what that is, it's the old style of printers that prints everything in a series of dots. Even from a couple feet away, you can clearly tell that the set is made this way and is very pixelated. Not only that, but when you rub your hand over the print, it's like rubbing your hand over a piece of paper. The plate itself is smooth and feels like glass, then when you touch the border it's really rough and not what I expected. Unfortunately, you won't find anything that's better unless you spend more, but this set still isn't worth the price."
1,Worst NB shoe ever.,"I normally wear an 11 1/2 in 574s but had to return the 420s for an 11. They run large, which is strange for being from the same company. They are super thin, light, and only stay comfortable for about a half hour. Afterwards your feet WILL hurt. I don't recommend them, even though they look cool. Comfort is a must, so I will be going back to my beloved 574's."
3,"Good, but not great","Strong points: interesting and unusual setting in Rio, good pace and atmospherics. Weak points: main character is a flawed, ornery man 'with a history', similar to many detective novel protagonists, but ultimately not as likeable or sympathetic as I prefer in this genre."
1,Horrible,"I wish I could review this item a -50 stars.. This product sucks. It broke on my 50th shot, the whisker bisquit itself kept falling off. I'm plain out pissed at this horrible product. Don't recommend it to any one. Words can't explain my anger"
3,Nice but difficult for me to wear,"I have a fondness for this scent. My grandmother wore for a year or two before she passed, and it reminds me of her. I bought it for that reason. Unfortunately, I can't wear it. The jasmine in Diamonds & Sapphires just dominates on my skin. I wish that I got the fruit or spice notes with D&S;, but I don't. I'm so terribly disappointed because.This is how white florals often wear on me. It will be worth a try again in cool weather, perhaps one of the first crisp, cool nights when Summer begins to transition to Fall. Maybe then D&S; will reveal its fruits & spices to me.I'm spraying D&S; on shawls & on clothing so that I can enjoy it. It's lovely. I just wish I could wear it on my skin."
2,open immediately,"I purchased this item well before Christmas because I felt the price was excellent, a really great bargain. However, I did not open the box immediately as I still had an opened bottle. When I opened the bottle earlier this week (1/26/2009) it was only about 1/3 full. The package was still sealed in the cellophane wrap, but the bottle was only about 1/3 full. Needless to say, I was slightly disappointed that my bargain was not such a bargain after all. I'll know better next time."
2,Did not care for the fragrance,"For whatever reason this fragrance did not blend well with my body chemistry. It smelled like cheap ""dimestore"" perfume on me."
4,Like Dislike,My wife likes it (thats all that counts since it was for her) I hate the smell. Smells like that awful Musk that I cant stand... Delivery was fast.
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this primarily to move files between the desktop and laptop I use in my classroom. After less than a month the drive stopped working entirely, so I exchanged it for a new one. The second one stopped functioning after less than 2 weeks. It was great while it was working, but very unreliable."
1,Usable but not great,"It's only my opinion, but NOT a GOOD BUY. Cheaply made and overpriced. The ""Single Syringe 1 Piece"" for $2.95 is a better deal. Or better yet, just buy a toothbrush holder."
4,this is NOT a rap album,There is nothing objectional or profane on this cd. I think amazon looked at the cover and decided to prejudge the material
4,Cute story,"We got this book for our little girl. The story is really cute! I did not, however, expect for half the book to be in black and white and the other half in color. I don't know what the technique is called where two pages are color then the next two are black and white then the next two are color and so on and so forth, but I'm not a fan. I may have just missed this in the description, though. Overall, it is a really good book and I would recommend it to others."
5,Wonderful Story I had somehow missed,"I thought I knew all the Dr. Seuss books, but this one came to my attention recently and I had never heard of it before. I bought it immediately in order to read it to my youngest daughter before she outgrows children's books. She loved the story and I had one more wonderful message to give her from Dr. Seuss, ""Keep thinking of all the wonderful things that are possible!"""
5,How can you not like Dr Seus?,"My father had the original printing of this book. The pages have have torn away from the binding and the cover is tattered and worn. But for 23 years it has delilighted and enticed me. There is never a moment that I pass by a pond and wonder where it connects to the sea. Oh what kinds of fish could there be, if I sit and I stew and am patient like you? And bait my hook and have a look and wait all day for McElligot's Pool to connect from me all the way to the sea."
5,Classic and timeless.,"I loved this book when I was a child. I introduced it to my son when he was 4 years old. He too was immediately smitten with ""McElligot's Pool"". The humor and the silliness is quintessential Dr. Seuss. The illustrations are expressive and vibrant. And the message conveyed; looking beneath the surface before you judge, the importance of keeping an open mind, and following YOUR heart, despite the negativity or criticism of others, is expressed in such an optimistic and whimsical manner, children and adults will adore this story."
4,A guideline for in-house facilitators,"If you are already familiar with the theory of TQM, this book is helpful for you to implement TQM in your company. The author presented his methodology Five-Phase Approach(TM) in detail, so that the in-house facilitators can incorporate this approach into their own implementation plan. For those companies want to save consultation fees, this book is a good saving."
5,Great debut,"Almost forgot about this little sucker. This was just an EP but it was the first release for LW, and it's quite a little firecracker at that. I had heard the first 2 albums (Death of Innocence, and Your Weapon) before I ever heard this, but this goes hand-in-hand with the style of those albums. There are a couple of earlier recordings of songs released later (""No Sorrow"" and ""Pow Pow""), and they don't sound a whole lot different. These are the only recordings by the line-up that included bassist Patricia Morrison (The Damned, Sisters of Mercy, Gun Club, the Bags... wife of Dave Vanian).Bottom line: If you like Your Weapon and/or Death of Innocence, or just good early 80's punk in general... then this is a must."
3,"Great concept, poor reproduction of images.","Of course this is an exceedingly interesting project. Great care has been taken for historical accuracy & authentic material/s..why then, can we not see the images? They should be larger & the book more expensive...or fold-outs...or not at all. There was a compromise here and I am sorry for it."
5,Excellent Classisal Music!,I just want to recomend this c.d.I am a big fan of the orginal Star Trek series and recently started buying the D.V.D.s and when I heard the music for the Corbomite Maneuver boy I just had to have it.All the peices are excellent and I would recomend this album to any classical music lover.Sadly these tv composers where not really accepted by the classical crowd but all to their loss not ours as because if these composers where obscure 19th centuary finds they would be climbing over each other to hear them.Trust me you will enjoy them.
4,Excellent Symphonic Treatment,"The music compositions for the original Star Trek series are very artistic and more like first-rate movie scores ... this symphonic re-recording with the melodic themes and subtelties emphasized, finally brings this music into a form that can be fully appreciated ... highly recommended to any Star Trek or movie soundtrack fan ...- Scriptor"
5,A circus like no other,"It is a rarity that a video has me awestruck after watching it for the first time. The only other video that did that to me was Riverdance. Cirque Ingenieux is one of those experiences that is satisfying on so many levels. The artistry of the performers, both musical and acrobatic, is outstanding. Colleen Ryan (The Angel) sings with an etherial yet powerful tone that sets Kitaro's work wonderfully. The dreamlike setting makes for a sometimes chilling backdrop to the performers that do feats that you would swear no human can do. The two asian contortionists who stretch their bodies in incredible shapes and directions. The two strongmen that perform an act so mindboggling, I had to rewind several times and see it again. Jugglers, acrobats, mimes, and other street performers fill out a video that is as visually stunning as musically beautiful"
3,It's an OK movie...,"I have watched it and found that it is not as good as some of the newer Cirque du Soleil movies, such as Dralion. It is sort of weird at the end. It has strange music which I didn't like personally, but you may find it enjoyable. I would have rated it 2 1/2 but you couldn't do that."
1,Waste of Time,"After trudging painfully through the first half of this book, I simply could not take it anymore. I threw it into the trash last night after finishing Chapter 12.The plot is ridiculous. The characters have no depth. The author has no grasp of technology or physics. I truly believe the author set out to make this story as implausible as possible. He succeeded...Pick up a Joe Buff book if you want to read a real submarine adventure story."
1,Tom Clancy should sue,"What a complete travesty of words.An almost implausible storyline, characters who can't seem to do anything without causing huge problems, and a plot so insipid that it would get an F-minus in any creative writing course in the world.I won't go into the technical inaccuracies, other reviewers have done that, and done it well. In fact, all I will note is that I spent four and one half years in the air force, and yet I seem to know more about naval operations than Mr. Rovin.One jarring thing that kept leaping out is Rovin's insistence on using full rank titles, all the time. This is done only when the person being addressed is in deep trouble for something. Constantly calling someone ""rear admiral"" is a sure way to get a stern talking to.This had all the makings of a good, maybe even a great story. Unfortunately, those makings were left to rot.Tom Clancy should sue just for having his name on the same book cover as Rovin's.I feel like I was robbed."
1,Not worthwhile - I almost gave up,"Agree with many of the earlier reviews. This book was ruined by the glaring errors. The author has obvously never spent much time under water or he would know some basic truths:Ice floats.air bubbles rise.Air bubbles have the same pressure as the water around them.Decompression sickness is a function of many variables, including depth, time at depth, body fat content, physical activity, temperature, etc., but one thing is for sure, you will NOT be symptomatic in any way after only thirty seconds at six atmospheres. Embolized, maybe, but not bent.Errors like this put this in the realm of fantasy, and pretty much detracted from the entire story. Give this one a pass. I probably won't waste my time on future work by this author."
3,Not What You Might Think,"This CD contains the contents of 2 LP's, plus two bonus tracks. The first LP (Story) consisted of alternate takes of many of his best known songs. It's pretty good, but may take a little getting used to if you are familiar with the original releases. The second LP (Everybody's Movin' Again) was recorded years later (1970's or 80's) and sounds it. More country boogie than rockabilly."
3,Disappointing,I bought this as a guidebook for mantra meditation and its not that so I'm disappointed in it. It might yet prove to be worthwhile.
5,Over 90 and loving it,This tape will let you appreciate growing old. It shows that we can achieve anything we aim for as long as we are breathing and have the energy to do it. It is the feel good tape of the year.
5,Over 90,"I found the video to be inspirational to two generations - my parent (age 95), and my generation (age 65), not simply for the accomplishments of the Over 90s but what we may aspire to also achieve."
3,King Kong Backpack,"Great design item, but feet on bottom (so it can stand alone)have come apart from the bag. Bag itself is decent.. but foot on bottom came apart early in school year.. hope it makes it too the end of the year..."
5,The best text on Southern Filipino Swords,"The most comprehensive guide to the bladed weapon tree of the Muslim Filipinos of the South also known as the Moros. 103 pgs devoted to the manufacture and background of the Kris, Kampilan, and Barong are covered as well as the sheaths for these swords, lesser known swords, and even the background of the popular Muslim Weapons Plaque souvenir."
3,Hitchcock film music without Bernard Hermann? Yes.,"Although less complete than other compilations this anthology's marit is to remind the general public that Hitch worked with many great composers (Hugo Friedhofer, Miklos Rozsa, Dimitri Tiomkin, Franz Waxman and John Williams) through his carrer, a fact usually overlooked because of his remarkable partnership with Bernard Herrmann (""The Trouble with Harry"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", ""The Wrong Man"", ""Vertigo"", ""North by Northwest"", ""Psycho"", ""The Birds"" and ""Marnie""). What really makes this CD special, however, is the only available recording of ""Family Plot""s main title, composed by John Williams, making it a ""de rigueur"" acquisition for Hitchcock and Williams fans."
2,Music From Alfred Hitchcock Films - Utah Symphony Orchestra,"Although this is an older CD (released in 1985), it still is a marvelous collection of Hitchcock film themes. The CD contains collaborations with composers Hitchcock used after his break-up with Bernard Herrmann. The music is elegant and highly polished. It is a full digital recording and a must for Hitchcock fans."
5,FRESH makes you want to eat,"FRESH is best summed up as this: if Food Inc. opened your eyes but made you not want to eat, FRESH will show you what's possible for the food we eat and make you want to cook up a storm of fresh, local, organic, and sustainable food. Definitely watch it!"
5,gooooo Joe,"Mr. Salatin seems to me to be a wonderful man, and if the politicians who run this showboat (america) or (the government) could eat the food from the animals he has raised. THEN go back to eaiting the crap they get from drive thru windows, they would understand the necessity of this way of food production."
5,Bio-Dynamic Agriculture is the Answer - It healed the Grape infestation in France,Not seen it yet. Plan to do so very soon. We must treat our animals with love and respect.Anne E. Bingham
1,Good start but falls very short,"Where this is another good example of the changing mentality toward our decrepit food system that is wrong in just about every aspect (except for churning out enormous volumes of crap product and corporate profits), it falls short in not dealing with the actual consumption rate. We simply cannot produce enough food to feed the population with these methods-to convert to these methods it would take more land than we have in the US. There has to also be a change in our consumption, a lot less of everything-and if some can handle it-eliminate animal flesh and their secretions all together-the land and resources nor our health can handle consuming all that we do-organic-free range-industrial-it all takes finite resources that we just can't keep wasting when there are alternatives."
1,Not Fresh at all.,"I totally regret buying this dvd! And I destroyed the dvd after watching it all the way through, because I didn't want anyone else to come across this dvd if I simply threw it in the trash can, because they would have their health jeopardized by the misinformation in this dvd.This starts out with a good message, but as you watch toward the end, it starts recommending animal food products...It is widely known now that any animal food product is bad for the human health.The human body is meant to eat only plant foods. Chronic illnesses in humans originated from eating foods our body wasn't mean to eat, and that is animal food products. I was thoroughly disappointed that the message is seriously flawed by recommending animal foods. Boo! bad health advice."
4,No Regret for this Plot,"I am NOT a reader of western novels, but in a Writer's Online group, one of the members noted they had written westerns under a psudenym of Wolf MacKenna. I thought it would be cool to read one of the books to see how well the author wrote.I was pleasantly surprised. The characters are 'real' and have a life of their own. The plot, while simple, moved along swiftly and dramatically. ANd, luckily for me, their was a pivotal ending, crisis averted, and everyone lived happily ever after.This book is definitely worth picking up and the 217 pages should be only a night or two worth of reading for speed readers.Definitely a good pick for a casual reader with (or without) western tastes in reading."
1,Worst score ever,"I watched Mad Max on Saturday and I don't think I have seen it in since it was released. This score was so out of place, out of context and so 70s movie-bad-orchestral-overdone. I think it might be the worst-matched movie score of all time."
5,Real Rock'n'roll baby!,"I gotta say that the mighty Devil Dogs kicked out some of the best rock'n'roll ever! These cats never got to enjoy the fame that they deserved and it's a real cryin' shame 'cause there will never be another Devil Dogs. The Dogs played a hearty mix of 50's rock'n'roll, 60's punk and mixed the whole cocktail up with a healthy dose of Ramones-like energy creating a modern hybrid sound that blew all the squares away! This band WILL go down in history as one of the all-time greats once the ever-[bad] music industry and indie hipsters wake up from Strokes mania. I'm sure the Devil Dogs ain't sweatin' it!"
2,Sorely Disappointed,"I expected a little more after reading the first volume, but several negative points about this manga became clear only a few pages in. The artwork is decent, but I lost track of where characters went and where they came from often. There was no smooth transition from scene to scene. Additionally, the storyline came off as highly sexist. I thought there would be some shounen-ai, but the main character's former status as a woman was over-emphasized, and any weakness or deception was criticized as a feminine trait. As the second, and final, volume of the series, there wasn't much development, nor a clear resolution. I was annoyed halfway through the manga, and downright furious by the end. I don't advise buying this, let alone reading it."
5,Great Pudding,This is great pudding. Very easy and simple to make But has Great taste and flavor. Will be buying more of this for our food storage system.
5,Carrying The Fire: An Astronauts Journeys by Michael Collins,"I was reading Deke! By Donald K. (Deke) Slayton and Michael Cusset. Deke Slayton was the highly respected chief astronaut and godfather to the astronauts of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions; In this book, I noted a positive reference to Michael Collins's book Carrying The Fire so I figured this as a must read.Michael Collins takes the reader through the stages of astronaut training and spaceship design and his own flights of Gemini 10 and the pioneering Apollo 11 with self- depreciating humour and irony. He manages to present a great amount of technical detail in an easily understood fashion in an articulate, intelligent, flowery, almost British manner.With a forward by Charles Lindbergh himself, this book is nearly 500 pages but seems only half that by the man who stood station 60 miles above Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on that historic first lunar landing."
5,"Michael Collins' ""Carrying the Fire""","I found this to be a highly-entertaining, very insightful look into the life of an astronaut during the Space Race of the 1960's. Col. Collins has an unique blend of humor, drama and history in this selection. I highly recommend this book for astronaut buffs!"
3,It's okay.,The reason I don't like this book is because of Mr Collins self serving remarks about he has had it with being asked what it was like in outer space.He makes the stupid remark about punching somebody in the gut for smoking a cigar.Maybe he shouldn't have signed up for the program if he doesn't want to talk about the experience that most people will never have.Also I don't like him saying that People who want autographs deserve a special place in hell.
1,Seeing Stars on the Moon?,"In the Press Conference just after coming back from the Moon, Michael Collins said, ""I don't remember seeing any"" (Stars).Later in his book ""Carrying the Fire"", he says that he did see Stars. Which is it Michael, Stars or No Stars? One way or another he is Wrong.I won't be reading a Book Of Lies from Michael Collins.Of course, seeing No Stars then seeing Stars means, we DIDN'T GO TO THE MOON.There is proof of Mr. Collins on Video, saying, He Did Not See Stars,then in Print saying He Did See Stars."
1,wrong battery for U205,"in Amazon product description, it listed the U205 as the compatible model.well, it's not. the bulge on the back of the battery prevent the LCD screen from opening. yeah....the battery fits in the compartment but you can't open the LCD screen; thus, cannot use the laptop.so, ONE star for wrong description. when you buy stuff online, the only thing you rely on is the product description and previous buyers experience. i hope my review save the headache for other potential buyers."
2,Laptop Battery for TOSHIBA,Did not fit the laptop battery conveniently as advertised. Though it works with the laptop screen opened partially.
4,mix of old and new,"Kate's website points out that all of her songs on this CD are previously released, while those of her husband John are new. You might consider buying the movie itself. Kate and John play 2 songs in a pub scene."
2,non-weatherproof to a surprising degree,"An earlier generation of this model had brass screws and o-ring gaskets to seal the battery compartment and the circuitry from insects and weather, and it took some bugs 5 years to work their way inside and damage the thing. In the current incarnation, the battery cover is just a plastic slip-on thing, like a cheap radio. Within a month outdoors, some slugs had managed to find their way inside and make a mess of it. If you plan to put one of these outdoors, I guess you could seal it in a ziploc bag."
5,The Real Deal,"This Icon Hulk figure is by far the best of all the others. Its sheer weight gives the feel of an incredibly made figure. Every musculature is detailed. The coloration is a deep green that is realistic and not cartoon-ish. The articulation allows for a variety of posing positions. Its heavy legs balances well with the massive torso and arms. The joints are tight, never having to worry about it becoming loose. It is definitely one of the most impressive figures in the Icon series."
5,Instrumental Heaven,"This is an incredibly eclectic collection of instrumental hits (and non-hits) released between 1957 and 1964. If you're in the mood for guitar solos only, or surf music only, or organ music only, then you're out of luck here--it's all mixed together! And I can't stop listening to it! You want to hear the Champs do ""Tequila?"" OK, it comes right after the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra and chorus doing ""So Rare,"" which follows jazz-great Cozy Cole's awesome but really hard to find ""Topsy Part II."" This 30-cut essential CD finishes with a couple of Lonnie Mack tunes that prove he is one the R & B guitar masters of this or any era. If you like this CD, go ahead and get Volumes 2 through 4. All of them contain a really smart mix of familiar tunes and stuff you've never heard before."
3,Think twice,Ipurchased two cds in the Teen Beat series with the intention of replacing my old vinal collection.Istill have the vinal.The Teen Beat versions are not the originals and in some cases are re-recorded.Very dissappointed.
4,LÉO THE LION,"No,this is not DAVID BOWIE,who recorded a song of that title,but LÉO FERRÉ,one of FRANCE's enfant terrible de la chanson ,who had several faces over the years.This collection gives you a sample of his work.Four songs can be considered classics of his repertoire:PARIS CANAILLE,MONSIEUR WILLIAM,LE PONT MIRABEAU and PAUVRE RUTEBEUF.If there were a perfect song for him,it was MONSIEUR WILLIAM,the story of a middle age man who suddently is caught in a tragic love affair;LE PONT MIRABEAU is a famous poem by APOLLINAIRE set to music;PARIS CANAILLE makes good use of a sort of FRENCH slang(argot)and PAUVRE RUTEBEUF is a four hundred years old writing(i am not kidding).A good buy to get acquinted with LÉO FERRÉ.You can go deeper after that."
1,lost!,"I would like to know which chansons are actually on this CD, as I don't like all Ferre's songs."
5,Great Antenna,This antenna is connected to a tower PC in my application. The acces point is around 250ft away. Before installing this antenna the PC connected at 1 to 18 Mb/S( 11 Avg). After the data rate has held solid at 36 Mb/S. I think the PC may have a poor WiFi card because my laptop connects at a higher rate when using external antenna. Also the 26 ft Trendnet cable is being used. A shorter cable would probably increase signal strength.
4,"Funciona muy bien, versatil y facil de usar.","Realmente es un buen producto, he usado esta antenna para hacer un enlace de 1.5 Km de distancia con linea vista y me funciona correctamente. Conecté la antenna a mi tarjeta de red inalambrica PCI y la apunté hacia un vecino que tiene un router inalambrico a 1.5 Km y me conecto con mas de la mitad de la intensidad de la señal. Hice pruebas dirigiendola hacia un hotspot que se encuentra a 7 Km de distancia y me detecta la señal pero la calidad a esta distancia ya es muy baja y no me conecta."
4,A fine addition to the Chess essentials,"""Bo's Blues"" brings together 22 of Bo Diddley's more blues-oriented sides from the Chess catalog, many of which you probably have already (""I'm A Man"", ""Who Do You Love"", ""Before You Accuse Me"", the hit single ""You Can't Judge A Book By The Cover"" etc.).But there is also some rare stuff here, including ""I'm Looking For A Woman"", ""Run Diddley Daddy"", the soulful ""Bo's Blues"", a (predictable) follow-up to ""I'm A Man"" titled ""I'm Bad"", the superb, driving boogie of ""Live My Life"" and ""Blues, Blues"", the swaggering shuffles ""Little Girl"" and the harp-driven ""She's Fine, She's Mine"", the melodic ""Heart-o-Matic Love"", and a silly, jive-loaded ""Cops And Robbers"" that features maraca shaker Jerome Green more than Diddley.This is not the place to start (that would be MCA/Chess' ""His Best"" or the magnificent ""Chess Box""), but once you have the essentials, this well-annotated 22-track collection is a fine stop to make."

5,Amazon Product Review,"Someone broke into our secured mailboxes and stole mail from 20 homeowners, so I never received my CD. Nonetheless, I'm certain I'd have rated it as EXCELLENT because the 2 songs I heard off the CD from a radio station were superb.. (Smile). Thank you anyway."
4,Good Jarrett marred by 20 minutes of doodlin',"Good Jarrett still means it's is miles ahead of most piano trios but the program is bedevilled by the long title track with its boring repetitive/live crowd pleasing/ caravan like doodlin'. On the other hand, I LOVE YOU is as good a piece of piano trio improvisation one is likely to hear on this planet with a masterful drum solo (mainly using the cymbals) included by Mr De Johnette. Worth owning."
5,A treasure,"Everything you've come to expect from the group, executed with inimitable grace, flair, and taste. As a longtime serious fan of this trio (owning their entire catalogue, besides Jarrett's solo recitals, etc, as do most diehards) I do consider myself somewhat of an expert where appreciation of this music is concerned! So it is without reservation that I insist that this one is a desert island Keith Jarrett Trio classic, among the many already recorded. The real benefit to this recording, besides the strength of the playing, is the freshness of material. Also, to mix things up a bit, you have the advantage of hearing just about everything the group has explored so exhaustively in the last two decades: straight ahead standards, moving ballads (the second track is Jarrett at his most romantic), blues and the looser free form improv the group has been playing around with of late.Not to be missed, neither for the beginner nor the seasoned listener."
3,no surprise,"...I want to heave a heavy sigh. My dream or my hope is that one day Keith plays with the young lions say Drew Gress on bass and Bill Stewart or Ari Hoenig on drums... just to see... I'm sorry folks, but after hearing this one, you'll find out that there's no surprise (except I Love You and Out of towners which are perhaps the best tracks)"
3,"Musically great, but what's with the singing","I have not listened to Keith Jarrett in years. I had enjoyed some of his long contemplative piano solos in the past. So I picked up the Out-of-Towners to see where he'd got to.Musically, the trio sounds great. But what is with that semi-out-of-tune, whiny singing along with the piano? I find it really distracting and annoying; it gets in the way of the music.If that is typical of the Jarrett trio on these albums, then this will be the last one I buy..."
4,On the wings of an eagle....,"As old as the film is at this point, somehow the soundtrack never seems to be outdated. By far one of the best New Age albums I own. Junior Homrich excelled at combining native instruments with etheral synthesizing that is evocative and dream-like. The visuals he attempts to represent with his music come through in a way that the listener will feel transported to misted rainforests, through the eyes of a bird of prey that is the spirit animal of Tome, Charlie Boorman's character.No amount of description can truly honor what Homrich is able to do with his compositions. They are surreal, abstract compositions that impart an opiate experience, clouded dreams of virgin rainforest and mystical shamans. Even if you have not seen the film, the soundtrack can stand on its own and will no doubt soon become an integral part of your cd collection, as it has for mine."
4,Great book for beginners,This book was very informative. I used to run and was thinking of getting back into it. I loves the walk fun plan that is in the book. I like that he encourages walking some during every run.
5,Love this!,"I am a huge CHIPS fan! Especially, since I have an obsession with ride-a-longs with the CHP. I am an inspired law enforcement student who hopes to one day be a CHIP, but is unfortunately not yet! I hope the people who put this out on the market gets their stuff together and finishes the job by getting the rest of the series out on shelves for true fans to buy to complete their collection! I cannot wait!!"
4,Teaching Marching Band Techniques Book,"This text covers all aspects of ""how to"" for teaching a successful marching band program. The examples are clear and the prose is easily understood. The information is very pragmatic. The text contains three selections as examples with accompanying drill charts. It lacks an index."
4,Great Resource for Newer Band Leadership,"This is a very helpful resource to someone putting a marching band program together. The authors share positive philosophies such as setting things up so your band can continually succeed, breaking down the show into conquerable pieces, etc. They provide several field show diagrams and a master sheet that can be reproduced to draw one's own. Their expectation is that a band director would prepare one elaborate field show per year and spend the season learning and perfecting that field show. There is also guidance on parade participation. Especially good if the reader is new to marching band, but experienced leaders would also get good reminders."
2,only good if you know nothing,most of the things I read in this book I already knew just by being in a marching band. its made for bands that are lacking in skill.
5,Jayhawk,I have read this book so many times since I was a teenager! I finally ordered this because it wasn't at the library to check out that day!
5,Awesome,This is one of my favorite books I've read it over and over again. It's defiently worth reading I couldn't put it down!
3,Nelly & Mr. Arnaud (Region 2) available only,"Nelly & Mr. Arnaud is an excellent french movie - I have seen it many times on the old VCRhowever when I got the DVD through Amazon I did not realize that the product, Region 2, would not work on my DVD player - unfortunately I was not sent an additional copy compatable for Region 1 - this was done previously by some other company. -So unfortunatelty I am not able to play this DVD as sent. Reminder when you order a DVD make sure it will play on USA machines, which is for Region 1 ONLY. Thank you."
3,Subtitles Cut off on Widescreen TV?,"Can anyone confirm that the 2nd line of subtitles are cut off the bottom of the screen when played on a widescreen tv? I began watching the film on my Sony 46"" Widescreen and anytime a 2nd line of subtitles appeared on the screen I could only see the top of the words barely. I tried on another DVD player and it was the same. I tried all settings, (Full, Zoom, Wide-zoom, Normal) and all 4 cut the subtitles off. I ended up watching it on my 4X3 Sony 36"" TV and I could read the subtitles. Anyway, good movie, just wish I could watch it on my Widescreen.Edit. This is due to overscan on many TVs. You should be able to see the subtitles correctly on displays without overscan, or 4x3 televisions."
2,Film ruined by mistake in DVD transfer,"I can confirm what the previous reviewer remarked, that the editors did something wrong with how they recorded subtitles on the DVD and that they are not readable on a widescreen TV on at least several types of DVD players, while the picture itself is recorded in widescreen anamorphic. The only way we could watch it with my non-French speaking wife was to set the TV to 4:3 aspect, set the DVD player as if it was pluged on a 4:3 TV and watch the movie with gray bars on the side and black bars on top and bottom. And while the anamorphic picture looked like a beautiful transfer, for some reason two players that I have tried had trouble scaling it properly to letterbox and many ""venitian blinds"" artifacts appeared during pans."
2,Bad Consulting Information,This book was not what I expected. It does not describe actual consulting practices used in the field of education or medicine. The practices discussed are general areas such as meeting planning or sales training.
5,Ah! My Goddess,To the point. The Art is consistant and well done. I like the way the first DVD takes off and keeps building on the story line. I enjoyed this more than the Movie. This is the type of story line I like so much I want to drink it slowly and not waste a drop. I wanted to find a series that filled my HAIBANE RENMEI (Worth Seeing!) attraction. This Series starts off doing just that! Not Many Anime titles motivate one to post a review right after you watch them. I believe that supports why I gave it a FIVE!
1,Media Blasters blows it,Volume 1 was available at Otakon 2005 and the voice acting on the dub is the worst ever.Tamyia sounds like Cookie Monster.The voice actress who plays Belldandy is some newbie that has no emotion in her voice whatsoever and she's playing the most emotional character in the series.[...]Media Blasters just successfully destroyed one of the best Anime Series of the year with this crap they call voice acting.If you want it for the japanese version buy it.If you want it for the english version don't bother you'll be poking your eardrumbs out with Q-tips.
5,Ah! My Godess the TV series,"This is the Ah! My Godess the TV series originally aired in Japan in 2005. This series pretty much follows the managa. What happens when a college student wishes a Goddess to live with him forever? You get to see the fateful meeting of Belldandy and Keiichi in the first episode, then follow their adventures with friends and enemies, and finally reach the climatic ending with the Terrible Master story arc in the manga.The region 2 DVD release is in anamorphic widescreen, eventhough the series was originally aired in a cropped, 4:3 format. Hopefully Media Blasters can get hold of the widescreen masters and give it the proper treatment."
4,A delightful and worthy anime,"I'm glad that this story is finally getting told the way it was meant to be. The previous OAV was good and had a lot of potential, but it was just way too short.I gave this 4 stars only because of a couple of minor complaints about the series box and the style of some of the subtitles.The series box on the bottom has an impossible to cleanly remove sticker...Would recommend to the manufacturer to use a stronger paper stock for the sticker and a weaker adhesive.I was quite pleased with the size and color of the subtitles, they were quite easy to read. However I was annoyed with the western-style name changes (it's Morisato Keiichi, not Keiichi Morisato). I had hoped for translations of all Kanji and Hirigana seen, but there was almost none."
4,Voice Actor Worries No More,"As an Ah My Goddess fan, I was a bit worried to initially hear that the voice actors would be different than the ones used in either the OAV or movie.But I am relieved now that I have experienced it for myself. The voice actors in no way ruin the series and in my opinion do a very decent job. Granted, Tamia's voice does resemble the Cookie Monster's voice, but even so it only adds a bit more flare to his colorful character.The only possible complaint that I can give is that of the character drawings, particularly Belldandy's. For those who have come to love the illustrations from the comics and OAV's, you may be a bit disappointed with the changes in the TV-series' character illustration.Overall I'd say that this is a pretty safe and worthwhile buy for AMG fans."
5,Worth the wait,"It's been 6 years since ""A Man Under The Influence"" as Alejandro battled (and still does I am sure) Hepatitis C. The production on this album is different than his others, there is less space and Alejandro's voice is up front. I think it works to the music's benefit as Alejandro's great songs sound terrific. Worth picking up for sure."
3,Waiting for the Austin City Limits album.,"Like some others, I saw Escovedo and his band on Woodsongs, and Austin City Limits. Those performances are what I want to buy, not this album. The songs are worth 5 stars, but the production by Cale sucks. I bought the album, but I hope they put out the Austin City Limits performance - that was worth 5 stars!"
2,"Energy, uneven vocals","I'm new to Mr. Escovedo so I don't know what ""illness"" was referred to in other comments. May have weakened the vocals? If these are typical, I've had enough. I bought this CD for ""Notes on Air."" It and ""The Boxing Mirror"" work. He runs out of breath but these songs work because he's speaking more than singing. The rest of the CD features nice guitar work and some high energy, but they can't carry the weak vocals."
3,Disappointed,"I really wanted to like this album, but it's simply not one of Alejandro's better efforts. For me, it's much too similar to his old Buick MacKane days, and lacks the simplicity, richness, and emotion that make Alejandro so unique.Save your money and see him in concert."
3,Brut 101 blaster,I was very dissipointed in the delivery time. It was well over 2 months with many delays. The instructions were a copy of a over memographed copy. Very poor. The Blast Hood included was of a very poor cheap quaility. Not worth using. I found the pipe connection at the bottom of the Sand Blaster loose. The circular metal welded to the bottom of the third leg bends easily. It had been bent by tilting the blaster. Should be thicker metal.
2,Frustrated,"I bought this unit in the hopes of sand blasting my truck frame. My first mistake was not screening the sand so I plugged the sand blaster up. After screeing the sand I still can't get it to flow. The instructions were a very poor memographed paper or a over copied copy. I think there is a backflush feature, if I can read the instructions. The small circular plate on the bottom leg bent easily. Should be thicker. The ""T"" connector on the bottom is loose and I can't seem to get it to tighten."
4,Engineering classic,"Open Channel Flow by Henderson is an engineering classic. It's a solid coverage of the material, easy to read, and contains some interesting discussion on the origins and experimental results for the empirical equations that we Water Resources and Civil Engineers use everyday. The book was copyrighted in 1966, so it is not modern, but I don't see this as a drawback - fundamentals haven't changed! I'm about a third of the way through the book in a graduate course, and I can only identify two problems. One - the book is only available in paperback, which makes it rather fragile. Two - some of the graphics are old, particularly photos of experimental setups, and could be improved. Altogether, a good text and I recommend it. PS - For a fun throwback, read the Appendices, which give advise on how to solve various problems using a slide rule, and briefly mention using computers to solve problems in the future!!"
5,Henderson's Open Channel Flow,"Along with Chow's ""Open-Channel Hydraulics"" and King's ""Handbook of Hydraulics"", this volume forms the classic triumvirate presenting hydraulics theory and practice. Even today, when it gets down to the technical nitty gritty, it is not unsurprising to see ""recent"" textbooks refer back to Henderson. In many ways, his approach to theory formed the basis of modern teaching approaches - so don't be scared off by the 1966 publication date. However, feel free to be frightened by the price - Yikes! One thing for sure, while hydraulics has not changed much over the years, textbook economics have!"
2,Not great,"This textbook describes the logic and theory behind open channel flow, but it leaves the student on his own as it has no explanations or examples to follow. Not a good learning tool."
2,"""Les Plus Belles Chansons""","These songs are boring, the music completely lacking in originality. I wish I had not spent good money on it."
2,Well it sounds good...,"The product did not come drilled for the Mass Air Flow Sensor. I had to spend several hours drilling and carving a hole large enough to allow it to fit. The product show's little improvement (1mpg<)to my mileage (I drive very conservatively as is). Sounds good under the hood, if that is what your willing to pay for. Did notice slight increase in overall engine power, but again, not enough to really make a difference."
5,Great music,"This is a wonderful CD - perfect for the car. The musicianship is excellent, and selection of pieces perfect for good listening."
3,NOT THE BEST,"When I started reading ""the sand lot""I thought it was the best book in the world but as the story went on I got more bored and the book lost my attention.It was hard to read the final chapture I don't know if it was because i had other thing on my mind or because the final chapture was really boring.It was still a good book but, i thought it was going too be a better book than it acttally is.Overall I thought it was o.k.If your into sports you will like this book.If a friend ask me is the sand lot a good book.I will tell him it is a o.k book but it is not the best.THE END"
4,Wonderful but slightly repetitive,"Gillian White has done it again. Copycat is a terrifically engaging novel about two neighbors. At first glance, it appears as though Jennie is extremely disturbed because she has developed an obsession about her neighbor Martha. But later on we realize that Martha is equally dependent on Jennie for her own particular reasons.Fast-paced, original, excellent plot and dialogue. My only complaint about the book was that certain parts seemed repetitious; however, it's possible that the author was simply trying to emphasize the repetitive nature of obsession.In general, I enjoyed this book very much and stayed up late at night to finish it. A real nail-biter with scary yet believable characters.Sigrid Macdonaldauthor of D'Amour Road"
1,God! This was terrible,This book was a big disappointment. It turned out to be a Christian-based approach to money management that was not mentioned in the editorial. I hated it.
3,good monitor,"I like this monitor. the chest band is a little tricky, but for the price this is a good deal."
3,"Good deal, okay product","This is a good heart rate monitor if you are going to be working out away from any interference. Otherwise don't expect accurate information, because when working out in the gym I was getting so much interference from other equipment that it was pretty much useless."
3,"Why the entire ""Right Stuff"" score wasn't released","This is old history, but I believe the reason why the entire score for ""The Right Stuff"" isn't available is because Bill Conti had a falling out with the film's producers. They wanted to use excerpts from other works such as Holst's ""The Planets."" So the entire soundtrack was never licensed. Track #4 on this CD is an alternate cut written by Conti for the Glenn launch sequence; this is what HE would have used, not the montage from ""The Planets"" substituted by the producers."
3,"Good try, but I think Bill Conti missed the ""Right Stuff""!","The score, what there is of it,is very good, but I was expecting a Main Title. I hoped to get the feeling of pride and exultation that accompanied the space program in the early days like in the film, but was sadly let down. Maybe this is ploy to sell more videos in order to hear the magnigicent music. Try again Bill!!!!"
3,Wonderful Music,"I love the music of ""The Right Stuff"" and this is as close to the soundtrack as I can get. The quality is good, but there are only a few ""Right Stuff"" pieces on here and I don't care anything about ""North/South"""
2,"This is all that Conti wrote for ""The Right Stuff""","The music that Bill Conti wrote for ""The Right Stuff"" is all here... the rest of the score heard in the movie was not written by Conti, but was mostly classical music. Thats why there is only about 15 minutes of original Conti music on this soundtrack for that film.North and South shows more originality and the actual London Symphony does a great job on this CD.... unfortunately, the entire 2 scores are less than 40 minutes. I gave this to a friend who is a Civil War buff.Conti is a far better conductor and arranger than a composer and he is also a champion of film music, so I give this recording 2 stars."
5,5 Stars for North & South,"The score to North & South is fabulous, and there is nothing else like it. It suited the mini-series perfectly, and it's too bad all 12 tracks are not devoted to the score. Some tracks from The Right Stuff score are very nice as well. I think both deserved their own soundtrack."
3,Where is the entire movie soundtrack?,The best part of the movie was the exciting and moving soundtrack. I was very dissapointed when I found out that I had to share only a portion of the score with a movie that I did not even like. Is anyone at the producing company listening to the buying public?
3,WHERE'S THE REST OF THE RIGHT STUFF?,"I would like to know how a film score that wins an Academy Award isn't avaliable in its entirety? The job done by Conti is admirable but most of the best music from the film is missing. Maybe, if were lucky WB will release the score or maybe put it on a DVD where you can listen to just the music throughout the film."
4,Definitely the Right Stuff but more South than North,"This academy award winning score is one of the best music scores in recent memory. It is stirring and patriotic while communicating the danger and the daring that was required of the Mercury astronauts. It is a hummable theme that can get you charged. It has lots of full orchestra with deep and fleshed out tones. Worth the money. The North and South theme is so-so. It is fine, okay music, but doesn't really stack up to the Right Stuff theme."
5,Tiptree Tawny Thick Cut Marmalade,I have been hunting for this marmalade without success on every visit I make to the UK. Apparently they no longer make it for domestic consumption. I was overjoyed to find an outlet in the US.
3,marmalade,it does not have the taste that i expected. i like the smuckers taste better. this has a different texture and color. i cannot say it is bad because i am not use to it. their lemon curd is great
4,Nice solution for those who do not like tool belts,"I purchased this vest because tool belt rigs fall off my pear shaped aging torso. It performs as I hopes it would. I purchased only after contacting Skillers and asking if they would guarantee the stitching for a reasonable period of time. I do not believe they can be expected to guarantee the fabric for any great length of time but stitching should be covered. After talking with Johan and being assured thet they would stand behind their workmanship I purchased a XXL vest with a screw gun holster, a hammer holder, and a tool pouch. Everything works well and I have not had any problems after nearly a month. I wish that I had found something like this years ago as I have owned at least three tool belt rigs and always ended up working out of a bucket. I highly recommend this vest and only hope that Skillers will add a hang up loop so that I do not have to lay it on the seat of my truck"
1,Don't bother with this one...,"Poor sound quality mars this collection of unremarkable early `60s doo-wop-ish girl group recordings. Only for the most passionate Patti LaBelle fans.I usually like the compilations of UK label Ace/Kent Soul (those for Irma Thomas, Carolyn Franklin, and the Ikettes are particularly good), but this one is sub-par. These recordings do not sound (and are not credited as being) digitally re-mastered. The sound quality is just terrible. And the last two tracks (both previously un-issued) have loud scratching/feedback on them. ""The Early Years"" may be the only available collection of Patti, Nona, Sarah, and Cindy's 1962-1965 recordings, but I would advise waiting until a better quality collection is issued in the future."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I thought this was going to be a good DVD about the Butcher boy was I disappointed I wanted to see some of his matches like against the shiek, Dusty Rhodes and so on but all I got was an interview and him asking all the time about when am I gonna get paid. Very disappointed."
3,"Was Good, But now it doesnt work!","I bought this controller a while ago. Like a year or more ago. It has been a really good controller. It does like batteries, but thats why you buy 2650 mah rechargable batteries, with a 15 Min. charger, Paul. Then you can play for hours, charge in 15 min, play for hours. The built in Headset jack is ok. It does have interferance which can be annoying. But that didn't stop me from using it. I have used MANY wireless controllers, and they all have messed up. This is by far the best one I have used. The only one I want to try is the Logitech Wireless controller. If fact, this is my favorite controller because of the bluetooth and turbo. I am going to buy another because after more than a year of torture, (dropping, throwing, etc.) it doesn't connect to the receiver anymore."
3,Great while it worked.,"This controlled was great while it worked, but it died after about six months. Power was a significant problem, if you were using the headset extensively. Still, it was probably the best controller for XBOX live as it was the only wireless controller with headset support except the Intec controller, which is terrible.If you can still find it, buy it. If you're just looking for a XBOX wireless controller try theXbox Cordless Precision Controller."
5,A Great Story...,"Secretly, I think all of us want to find sunken pirate treasure. Am I wrong? Benchley tells another ocean oriented story about a married couple on their honeymoon who happen upon something very interesting while on a routine wreck dive. There are many myths about what this ship was carrying, and now there is a race to confirm the whereabouts of the long lost treasure.There are no typical monsters (as we are used to seeing from Benchley) however, when we see how people can act when gold is at stake, we see a monster more fearsome than anything seen in Jaws or The Beast.Buy this book, its a hidden treasure to be sure...Relic113"
4,Don't expect Jaws!,"By that, I mean, although this book is well written and entertaining, it is definately not Jaws! So, don't buy this book expecting to read something as frightening and gripping as Peter Benchley's Jaws which as you know, was a blockbuster book! The Deep, although sometimes slow in sections, is a story about two people (a man and a woman) who are deep sea diving for treasure. While on the ocean bed, searching for artifacts which they've heard are supposed to be down there, they accidently come across thousands of little glass vials which seem to be filled with some kind of fluid. From there, the story is more of an action movie between the good guys and the bad guys. Yes, it is written in the same Benchley style as his other books but it just doesn't have the kind of 'pull' that Jaw's did. Even so, I would still recommend it as I would all of Benchley's books."
4,Well written,"I have the original 1976 first edition from Doubleday, small and handy and a great read specially when you're on vacation somewhere tropical. The premise is fairly simple about honeymooners in Bermuda running into some really bad people and sunken treasures. The main characters David, Gail and Treece come alive as Peter Benchely weaves mystery, danger and the possibilities of finding long lost treasures in the deep. Treece is more well defined as a character but I was a bit shock when he actually kills his own brother, Kevin for telling. The plot is easy to follow but it got a bit dizzy during the underwater fights. If you're not a real mystery reader but prefer to read something light, away from the biographies and non fiction, this would be a good break. Benchley builds enough mystery and defines his characters skillfully for you to care what's in the next page and how the story ends. And ofcourse this is the hallmark of a good mystery novel."
2,"Sexist, boring book","Did men really think this way in the seventies? Wondering how a sexual assault of a girlfriend will affect their own sex lives? Wow.Otherwise, there is too much boring detail and very little action. I won't read anything else by this guy."
4,Halloween reinvented,"I've been a fan of John Carpenter's Halloween for several years now, and a love for the film's classic score goes hand in hand with that. Here, the music is reinvented and modernized, and creepy new themes are also introduced. Plus, we get Mr. Sandman, the song that is probably more ascossiated with the Halloween series than any other. More great music for Halloween night."
4,"GOOD,BUT NOT GREAT.","""HALLOWEEN 2"" WAS A GREAT FILM, BUT I'M CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR THE SCORE.THE SCORE HAS A KIND OF DIFFERENT FEELING THAN THE FIRST ""HALLOWEEN"". TRACK 1:""HALLOWEEN THEME"" IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ""HALLOWEEN THEME"" IN THE FIRST ""HALLOWEEN"", IT'S THE SAME THEME IT'S JUST THAT IT SOUNDS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.BUT, I LIKED TRACK 12:""MR.SANDMAN"".BUT THIS IS A MUST FOR ANY ""HALLOWEEN"" OR SLASHER-FLICK FAN,BUT,OTHERS MAY WANT FOR SOMETHING ELSE.OVERALL ""HALLOWEEN 2"" IS A GOOD SOUNDTRACK TO AN EXCELLENT FILM."
5,HALLOWEEN II: ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK,"HALLOWEEN II OST IS ONE EERIE SOUNDTRACK! HALLOWEEN II STANDS TO ME AS ONE OF, IF NOT THE CREEPIEST HALLOWEEN SOUNDTRACK. HERE'S WHY: 1. HALLOWEEN II MAINTAINS THE ""ORIGINAL THEMES"" ALONG WITH SOME NEW IDEAS. 2. JOHN CARPENTER'S ASSOCIATION WITH ALAN HOWARTH BRINGS TOGETHER TWO GENIUS FORMS OF TALENT. WHILE THE ORIGINAL HALLOWEEN SOUNDTRACK IS A MASTERPIECE, HALLOWEEN II'S FEATURED ELECTRONIC ORGAN BUILDS VOLUME TO THE ORIGINAL THEMES WHILE STILL KEEPING SOME PIANO-BASED TRACKS, SUCH AS ""HE KNOWS WHERE SHE IS!"" OVERALL, HALLOWEEN II'S ENHANCED SOUNDTRACK IS A HALLOWEEN ""CLASSIC."""
4,Outlaw's Fortune,"""Outlaw's Fortune"" is the fifth of six Western novels written by W. W. Lee who is best known as the mystery novelist Wendi Lee. The main character in all of Lee's novels is Jefferson Birch, a former Texas Ranger who does work for Tisdale Investigations in the Old West. Tisdale asks Birch to find and capture the mastermind train robber, Tom Hogan. Hogan had just robbed the gold on a train in Albuquerque. He dressed as a helpless old woman to get on board the train. Birch is very reluctant to find and capture Hogan because of a past connection with the train robber. Birch finally agrees to bring Hogan in to face justice. To give away any more of the plot would give away the mystery of Tom Hogan. Birch finds him rather easily and they set out to recover the gold and bring Hogan in to the authorities. The first four of the Birch novels have a strong mystery plot, but ""Outlaw's Fortune"" is much more Western than mystery. It is a fine Western as are Lee's other Jefferson Birch novels."
5,Don't Say 'Roots Rock',"Hailing from the darkest back rooms and dirtiest saloons south of Eight-Mile Road in Detroit,The Gories single handedly capture the basest values of rock music. Predicted by Lester Bangs, The Gories existed for but a fleeting moment, yet left an indelible mark an all that followed. This CD, their final assult on the recording establishment, contains some of their greatest recorded moments. ""He's Doin' It"" is about Dan's freaky cat, who 'danced' to whatever was on the stereo. ""Omologato"" is Mick's paeon to his favorite type of car and his rendering ('rendering'-think of a glue factory) of ""There But For The Grace Of God I Go"" is the best version of a disco song never played on the radio. All in all, this album is a stomper from start to finish. And don't call them 'Roots Rock' (or 'Damaged Blues' for that matter) because they transend any pigeon-holes a labeling could ever try to stuff them in."
5,Pure Post-ProtoPunk RetroGarage Rockand/or Roll etc...,"Pure rock energy puts to shame 99% of the material put out by other ""Punk"", or ""Rock"", or just about anything! Adolescent energy, without the ignorance, and put out without any real pretension, just for fun. Hey kids, if you want something really cool and really ""indie"" that nobody else you know has even seen, THIS is the CD!"
1,Waste of money.,I bought this to replace holster I sat on and broke. This holster does not fit on my phone. It is about a 1/4 inch to long. Trashed as would cost more postage to return that to replace. Needless to say will not order another from this company.
1,Fits bill but looses the phone,"I bought this as it should be an easy holster to use. I find it does not lock the top part of the phone. I regularly hit it, open the phone, and have lost the phone twice. My other holster for a Motorola phone was not designed this way. I have stopped using the holster."
1,It would be better in Japanese,"This book is sooooooo boring it would be better in Japanese. If it were in Japanese we could at least make up our own stories and/or try to lear Japanese (It sounds boring but its a blast compared to the book). If you realy want this book Ill sum it up for you. Harry is good, I look like him, Voldermort is mean. I play quidicth on the ground using brooms like golf clubs and I have a scar that looks like a thunder bolt if you squint on my knee! There yah go! The whole book! Oh yah! I couldnt understand what the pictures were either."
1,Tells us what we already knows,"It's basically a bunch of kids telling us that ""We loveHarry Potter,"" hence the title. It's basically full ofpredictions and other material that you could find on a web page. If I where you I wouldn't waste my money on it. It's compltely usless. If you really want it try getting a copy from the library but I don't see why you would..."
1,A Terrible Waste of Time,"If it was possible, I'd give this book a zero. It was a complete waste of time!Most of the book consisted of pointless letters from children seven and under to who knows who and said things like ""I love Harry. Snape is mean. Harry is nice."" over and over again. The editor's comments on the letter that were supposed to clarify it for the people who haven't read the book usually just restated what the letter said- I doubt seriously that Moore read the books herself.A lot of the information in the kids' letters were fraudulent as well- some made comments about teachers called ""Madame Pooch"" and made comments about ""Filch's cat having to die"". The sections after that were just as worse, consisting of ""what we want to be in the Harry Potter books"", playing Quidditch on the ground, and other stuff that was even more boring... a terrible book. Don't waste your money."
5,Great addition to the Potter books!,"Though this book isn't a Harry Potter story, it is very neat and interesting to read. I just love seeing how my kids and other kids feel about the series!"
1,It would be better if it were never written,"I loved all the Harry Potter books, but was very skeptical to read them beforehand because of books like these.It turns a really good and mature book and turns it into one of those stupid ""ralphie ralph and the detective club"" books. The kids who wrote in the book don't sound smart enough to understand it. This more than anything I have ever seen before does shame to the image of the Harry Potter books, it is truly stupid."
5,IIIIITTTTSSSS BBBBRRRRRRRRIIIILLLLIIIIAAAANNNNTTTT!,"this book tells you all about how to be a wizard and letters to harry,hermione,ron,hagrid and of course lots more. there are also fhard anagramsand lots more ! Its brilliant so get it right now.and PLUS!"
1,Most disappointing,"When someone gave me that book to read, I thought it would be fun to see what children think of Harry Potter, to see how his story fuels their imagination. Instead, all I found was incomprehensible gibberish (and proof that few of those children have really understood the Harry Potter stories), and boring and pointless comments like ""I love Harry. I hate Snape."" over and over again. Any guestbook on any Harry Potter website provides more insight into kids' thoughts than Mrs. Moore's book. Good thing I didn't spend any money on it - the waste of time was bad enough."
1,This is just pointless.,"I wish they WOULDN'T tell us why they love Harry Potter... or, if they must insist on such behavior, then I secondly wish that they would say something other than ""I love Harry; I hate Voldemort"" until they are blue in the face. The book's just a gimmick to make money off of Harry's fame, so don't buy into it (literally). There's nothing new to be gleaned from this unless one is specifically looking for a bunch of monotonous 8-year-old praise."
1,And we DON'T need a book to tell us!,"Along with any popular idea, whether it is new technology, new fashion, or new literature (ahem!) there are knockoffs and cheap attempts to make a buck off the wave of success. This book is an example of someone doing something completely uncreative, simply throwing the name ""Harry Potter"" in the title, so it would come up in searches for the genuine thing. The Harry Potter series is wonderfully successful, and rightly so. It is full of magical adventures, real trials and tribulations, and enchants adults and children alike. Let's discuss why we love Harry with a neighbor, cousin, neice, grandchild, or friend, not with an inane book that manufactures these conversations for us.I would have given this cheap knockoff negative five stars....and thrown an invisibility cloak over it, and shipped it off ot Azkaban!"
1,"Most disappointing, I thought it would be so much better.","In this collection, children talked about the Harry Potter books. Unfortunately, the entire first half of this book was endless reviews of the books, many of which were wrong and/or repititious. I was bored out of my mind by these reviews, which told the storyline but not what the children enjoyed about the books, and HELLO, we already KNOW the storylines, right? The last part was some letters and recipes and other things, and overall the title ""We love Harry Potter; WE'LL TELL YOU WHY"" is completely false. I wish it had been thought out more and better edited."
5,One of his Best,"Read it when it first it first came out inHardcover, it's been a while, but it stillsticks out in my mind as one of the besthorror novels I've ever read. And I have readmany. ""Midnight Sun"" is also highly recommended."
3,"Great Build, but a Poor Ending","I wanted so much to just love this book, but I'm sorry, I just don't. Campbell is great with building tension in his novels. This one is no different. As the story progresses, I felt as if the lead character and a major life-changing fate was bearing toward a collision course.However, once I reached the ending, I was soundly disappointed. All the buildup and all the tension was summed up with a one-chapter ending that lasted all of maybe three pages. It was as if Campbell was writing this book ""his way"" until he looked up and saw a deadline looming, so he rushed to finish it.Do I recommed this? Sure, it's a great and tense novel, but just be warned - the ending is very weak."
2,"Campbell, Ancient Images","Ancient Images is not my first Campbell read, but it is the first one I have managed to finish. I thought this novel had a lot of good ideas but overall was a mess of everything it was trying to do. I love the idea of trying to track down a surpressed film from the thirties and finding out why it was hidden but then weird monster/creatures get involved, ancient rituals, and I just didn't really care about much of it. The plot totally lost me after the first half of the book and I had to force myself to finish. As always, I respect this novel because I know others somewhere will love it, but I didn't get any enjoyment out of it and remember about 1% of it after finishing."
3,The Hollow Lord of the Dark,"This collection of Russell Kirk's supernatural fiction ranges in quality from simply lordly and brilliant(""What Shadows We Pursue"") to utterly hollow and bombastic (""The Last God's Dream""). And too many of these stories are predictable. In other words, there aren't many chills here but the ones you will find are first-class. I think the reason for this is because Kirk put too much of himself into these stories. If you ever read at his autobiography, ""The Sword of Imagaination"" (written in the third person, incidentally), you will find its style digressive and ponderous, a style that is amply reflected in these stories. I am not advising you to pass on this collection, but just to get it at the library or wait for ""Ancestral Shadows"" to come out in paperback."
3,Short and simple,"Comparing this to what the real Ludlum or Clancy, or (looking back) MacLean gave us, there is a shortage of complexity and plot turns. Not BAD, actually a page-turner that I enjoyed, but not up to even Mayer's Atlantis or Area 51 plots."
3,Good read.,Wasn't everything I hoped for when I bought the entire green beret series but it has set the foundation for deeper back grounds and improved scenarios.
5,Mayer does not disappoint,"In his typical style , Bob Mayer does not disappoint. This is a page turner you will not want to put down."
3,EYES OF THE HAMMER,A BOOK LIKE EYES OF THE HAMMER IS THE TYPE OF BOOK THAT I READ FOR FUN. NOTHING DEEP IN THOUGHT BUT SOME ACTION.
4,Hits the nail on the head,"Military action novels are usually not my cup of tea. To often military writers pad their novels with detail and plot devices that speaks 'never been there, never done that'. Such is not the case with Bob Mayer's 'Eyes of the Hammer'. Highly recommended."
4,Special Ops Hammer Drug Cartels,"Bob Mayer did an excellent job creating an action packed thriller - Eyes of the Hammer. The premise being to utilize the special forces personnel from the Air Force, Army, and Navy to ultimately ""hammer"" drug production facilities throughout Columbia. The story line is 5 star but I rated lower due to lack of sufficient editing; there are hyphenations within sentences which were a distraction."
3,Hang in there!,"Is this a manual for a military video game? Well, no but you have to hang in there to get to say 35% through before Mr. Mayer grabs you by your mental images and yanks you into the story. I don't know how much of the story is based on reality in Columbia, but I would say everything seems to point that way. Recent history points toward insight by Mayer on Columbia and Venezuela. Also, the raid portrayed in his story brings to mind how the Navy Seals took out O Sama. The reader ends up with a hero worth rooting for and a heroine to save his ""bottom"".No regrets on your book Mr. Mayer."
2,Boring,"If you like action, read the first 3 pages, then the last 30 pages. You can rip out everything in between."
3,Standard Rambo fare,"Set in the 1980s, a small group of military fighters, sanctioned by higher-ups, carry out illegal incursions into a foreign country. There is a high body count and an invincible hero. Weapons and equipment are described in loving detail but people are mere cardboard cut-outs.Nevertheless, the story keeps the reader's attention and I found myself reading it to the end."
5,Great Action/Adventure Story,"Bob Mayer knows Special Forces and knows how to write a great story. The action is in Columbia and the battle is a life and death struggle for a captured SF sergeant involved in strikes against drug labs. The action is fast and tense and the heroes, a SF warrant officer and a female CIA agent are a great duo. Mayer also gives us an inside look into spec ops tactics and equipment in this tightly written thriller."
5,Mayer makes great characters,I really enjoy Mr. Mayer's stories. His characters kind of seem real and their sense of humor in the face of danger makes for fun reading. I can lose myself in his books and just enjoy the story. I really do enjoy this character and storyline.
5,SPECIAL FORCES PRESENTED REALISTICALLY,"As a retired Special Forces soldier, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how it 'really is'. Yes, the plot may seem strained at times, but weird stuff like this used to happen a lot. Always had to be looking over your shoulder like these guys had to. Besides, it was an enjoyable read to lead into the rest of Mayer's Riley series. GO FOR IT."
2,Seriously flawed,"In the rush to catch the Da Vinci train, this stew of ideas was allowed to skip the editing process. Numerous incorrect spellings, no bibliography, only thirty odd footnotes (three from the author, two from Dan Brown)and even chapter 18 following chapter 10. His true sources which had to include Ovason, Baigent etc., go uncredited. His premise, of ""salt-line"" families goes unproven. It could literally be claimed that millions are included in ths select brotherhood. His claim of no proof of Jesus being Jewish is contradicted within pages as the brother of Jesus, James, says only Jews can be part of the Jesus faith. Overall, a huge let down."
4,Handy helper,Easy to set up and use in a very crowded garage. Can be moved if necessary. Fine product at a fair price.
1,Maybe mine was just a lemon.,"I have one of these ""punks"" (cross between pump and junk with emphasis on junk). The second time I used it it started making lots of noise. I estimate I have used it about six hours now and have taken it apart to see what was wrong with it. It has a broken second stage vane and I can't find any place to get one. Robinair does not seem to offer any parts for what they refer to as the ""module"", which is the pumping section. They will sell you a new module for 250 some dollars.Or you can ship the entire thing to one of their few service centers and let them repair it. Haven't checked the cost of that, but am betting their fees plus two way shipping would not be less than $250. All for a part that should cost no more than $2.00 and I am perfectly capable of replacing myself. As I say in the title, maybe mine was just a lemon, but I will never buy another Robinair tool of any kind!"
4,Great for Composites,"This pump is working great for composite work, vacuum bagging. It pulls plenty of vacuum very fast and holds it for hours.If the bag has a good seal this pump can be ran with no complaint however if there is only a slightest leak in the bag seal, this pump will smoke similar to a smoke machine at a discotech. The fine oil mist smoke will remain airborn for up to six hours. It is not designed to be an air pump, so just fix the seal on the bagged part and no worries.I like the pump so far and feel it is a good value. I purchased the pump from [...] through Amazon.com and have had a great experience. Each order from them has been filled imeadiatelly and I have always received my orders many days ahead of schedule."
4,good pump,"The vaccuum pump arrived in just a few days and I have already used it for a couple of jobs. It does a good job on residential hvac equipment so far. I was glad that the oil and the fitting tee came with the pump. That was something that I could not determine before ordering and figured that I might need to get locally. I was pleased with the price. I had previous experience with this model before, so I was already confident in the pump."
5,Great Pump,years ago this was the state of the art vacuum pump I wanted at $600 - when I moved to Washington I got back into the A/C business and at $250 at Amazon - I jumped on the deal - this is a workhorse that should outlast me. Delivered on time - I have been a very satisfied Amazon customer.
5,Wonderful,"This book has it all -- great pictures, great ideas, even great recipes. A good resource for those who want to build their own herb garden."
3,last solo effort from Skid Roper,"Skid Roper may best be remembered as one half of the duo Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper, a college radio and MTV favorite from the 1980s. This 1991 release is the second and (so far) last solo effort from Skid, preceded by the 1989 release ""Trails Plowed Under"". And a genuine solo effort it is, the CD says ""all instrumentation by Skid Roper"". If you are familiar with his previous work, this is more of the same: good roots rock / rockabilly with an amusing slant. The track listing:WhirlwindThe Emperor's New ClothesMisconstruedCalling All PlanetsHouse of CardsDark Side of the SunShe Walks AwayShack Out on 101Lydia's CafeI Was A Teenage CavemanRed Ridinghood RoadStop the EarthThe RiddleSkid, where did ya go? We miss ya.P.S. The album title which appears on the CD itself says ""Two Car Mirage""."
3,Good for showing you stiches,this book is OK if you need instruction on how the various stiches are done....I was looking for more patters I could copy
1,Customer Service,I placed a book order in mid-November and it is now December 21 and I still have not received it. Promised delivery was November 26 - December 13. How hard is it to put a book in the mail? Not likely to order again any time soon.
3,Good quality but overpriced,The quality of the baseballs is standard compared to the competing brands but these were about 15% overpriced. They were the only ones available on amazon when I needed to buy them so I had no other options from which to choose. Ii will not buy these again at the inflated price.
5,OOOOH YEAH,"I have played many games based on this book and never really read it. I have finally got a chance to read it, and it is very thorough. The books tell you about things that are not told in any of the games. Now, that I understand the story line better and can appreciate the games more.The book starts around in the Yellow Turban era where the 10 eunuchs are misproperly using their power. Liu Bei (Xuanbei) meets with Zhang Fei and Guan Yu and become oath brothers. The book has many violent scenes which is a plus because Zhang Fei chops people in half.The down side to these books are there are very many spelling errors. The book is also more lenient towards the Shu side rather then the Wei and Wu.I would recommend these books to people who would like to know more about the three kingdoms and are interested in the games."
1,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of The Three Kingdoms saga. I wanted a version that in my mind was worthy of the wonder and significance of the work. This version, for the cost, is very disappointing. I am through the first nine chapters or so, and I must say that this version does not live up to expectations. I see typographical and spelling (!) errors on seemingly every other page. There are also numerous references within the text to other works and versions that make me think there have to be more comprehensive, superior versions out there. I wanted a version that I could hang onto for decades, something worthy of prominent display on my bookshelves, and this one isn't it. If you are new to the ROTK world, this could be a great introductory work, but only if it were $40 cheaper. Avoid and instead try the local library."
3,Great Story bad revision!,"Ok, Three Kingdoms is a amazing volume which mixes history with mythlogy during the three kingdom period of china's past. It really is a great story! The only bad part is that this volume seems like a rough draft. There are literally tons of spelling errors and mis-use of english language. Obviously they should have put more effort into translating this better for the english audience. And the price of $39.99 is a bit hefty for 4 paper-back books! I would look for a different translation for a cheaper buy."
5,"Wonderful, with one major flaw, but still Wonderful!","I don't want to leave a long comment because the truth is the book is a great classic. My only problem with it has been constant grammar errors. Once Lord Guan Yu is referred to as Lory Guan Yu, and just things like that. In fact, on the back of the book their is an error in the first line, so I will say that I wish the editor would have done a better job with the errors, but other than that, it's flawless!"
5,Read this before buy!,"This is a great book! But, before you buy this, you have to remember that it is 2000 some pages long. This isn't a book that you can't just sit down to read for the heck of it. I suggest you should be fimilar to some of the names, like Cao Cao, Sun Jian, Liu Bei (or Xuande as Moss Roberts translates it in the Paperback edition, the one I'm refering to). I am fimilar with the Dynasty Warriors series and other games related to this subject.Even if you don't know that many names, don't let what I said stop you from buying this book. If you have [money] to spair, some free time, and don't get fusterated when the book has its boring moments, because every book does. Believe me though, this is a good book, and you get your monies worth."
1,Horrible Quality of Materials,"This is the most difficult to read book I have ever read. I mean this literally. I am not talking about the reading level or the quality of the translation. The pages are the thinnest I have ever seen in a book. You can clearly see the text from the other pages quite clearly. The low contrast makes the page literally difficult to read. I know they did this to cut costs, but this is stupid if you can't even read the book. I would have rather paid an extra 10 to 20 dollars for some thicker pages and an extra volume. Try and find a better version if you can."
2,Disappointing,"I was greatly disappointed when my granddaughter opened the jar. 90% of its contents is shredded paper. There were only 10 sheets of paper, a few feathers, pipe cleaners, pompoms, popsicle sticks, and lots of sequins. There should be a lits of the items contained in the jar. I cannot understand how people could have given this item five stars. I would give it two (2)."
2,kind of skimpy,this was a christmas present for my granddaughter. It was not exactly what was expected. It was kind of chinzy. Had lots of cut up tissue paper but not much else.
1,Don't buy - it's 70% shredded paper!!!,"This ""art jar"" is practically worthless. Sure, there are a few pieces of paper, a handful of pipe cleaners, and other miscellaneous goodies, but this jar, no kidding, was filled at least 2/3 full of shredded colored paper! My son was so disappointed."
2,90% shredded paper,"This Art Jar is packaged beautifully, but once we got it home we realized that it was mainly shredded paper. Great idea, but very deceiving."
1,Extremely Disappointed with contents,"As other reviewers stated, 80% of the jar is filled with paper confetti. The value of the included items is probably less than $10. That being said, my three year old son loved it - he didn't seem to notice that there wasn't that much included, but I had expected a lot more. It was very disappointing."
2,Very Disappointed,"We do a lot of crafts with our daughter, so we received this item with great excitement. Then we opened it. We were expecting a large amount of quality items. Unfortuneately it was mostly filled with a bunch of crepe paper. The felt stickers were crappy too. I would not recommend this item."
1,disappointment,"I agree with other reviewers, this jar is filled with confetti. I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this. I was excited that it was eligable for free shipping because it wasn't before. So I just put it in my cart. I would rather have picked out things separately at a craft store..pretty junky."
3,Nice!,"Enjoyed the product, a lot of great stuff and many types of activities that I can do with it. Definitely recommend!"
3,"Cool buckert if crafts, but has a lot of filler.","This bucket of crafts is cool but they put a lot of colored strips of streamers in it, so it looks like it has more in it then there really is. It's about 1/2 filled with them!"
5,love it,"My kids love the jar and so do I. SO many things to work with. My kids make ""Gifts"" for people. THey love creating things. Keeps them busy for a while."
5,Tom Shannon Presents the Rockin Rebels,"Wow...what a time machine! Put this CD on and it transports you back to the late 50's early 60's. Even if you never listened to WKBW DJ of the time, Tom Shannon, the music of the Rockin Rebels is still meaningful. Fully intrumental, it allows you to cruise down a 21st century highway, but the aura in the car is the time when life was simple and fun. It is a great buy!"
3,Rare but not that rare.,"I don't know what these people are on, but i just bought this album from a guy in germany, bran new. for 15.00 Euro, that's $19.16, includes shipping. $ 163.00 $149.00 thats insane. Who's laughing now. Hopefully not these clowns."
1,Really disappointing,I was so disappointed when I received these. The wood was really sloppily PAINTED brown and the locking mechanism is very cheap. You get what you pay for I guess. Returning immediately.
2,Works for 3 Months,"I purchased this bag for my daughter, who is in 4th grade and totes around 3-4 large textbooks daily. The entire handle broke off after 3 months. Only buy this rolling backpack if you or your child intend to use it for light loads."
4,Backpack/Rolling Cart,Awesome as a traveler pack or semi-brief case of which I use it for. Very durable and has lasted me almost 2 years and many trips now. Was priced right and is highly durable.
2,Did not last more than 3 months,"Bag fell apart at the bottom stitching after 2 months. If you use it as rolling cart, the seams at the corners at the bottom of the bag, beside the wheels are not protected and will wear away quickly causing the bag to open up at the bottom. On a regular rolling case these are normally protected by a piece of plastic or rubber.Have noticed that a lot of other back pack / rolling bags are built like this however I have since replaced with a Samsonite version that does have the plastic protecting the seams."
4,Watch it for Tony Leung Kar-fai,"First-rate Taiwanese drama about the tainted politics of the island. Despite having two leads from Hong Kong, this is not a Hong Kong movie. Mak's taut direction moves the well-thought-out script along in a compelling and gritty fashion, and the drama never slackens. Andy Lau plays a righteous cop trying to track down proof of the corruption; he looks good here, but he is no eye-candy (for once). But Lau is upstaged here by a staggering Tony Leung Kar-fai of ""The Lover"" fame (no relation with Tony Leung Chiu-Wai), who plays a ruthless gang leader - he is worth the entrance fee alone. This performance proves once again that the best of Hong Kong is more than a match for the best of Hollywood. And you get more than a glimpse on his tattooed butt. Definitely worth catching."
2,Didn't do what I wanted,"Either I am doing something wrong, or the letters are not stamping clearly enough. I hoped to stamp washers in order to make necklaces. Didn't work and the set seems a bit unimpressive."
3,Can you please put on the CD cover please?,Can you please put on the CD cover for other future buyers?
3,Good & Bad,"Some rare rarities here - beware though that the quality is poor, none are seemingly off master tapes and some are quite crackly & hissy (all vinyl). Liner notes about some of the groups would have been nice too - there are no notes whatsoever. Interesting release though as some of these tracks would be next to impossible to find elsewhere."
3,doesn't even pretend to have a plot,"This movie doesn't even prretend to have a plot, it's just one fight scene after another. The director is smart enough to know if you can't think up good dialogue don't use any. The acting never get's cheesy. It's very funny and easy to watch."
3,good resource,"This book is a revised edition of a previous text and is good for a new teacher looking for a job, but not as useful as I had hoped. I purchased this book to get information on creating a digital portfolio, but I was disappointed that the section on digital portfolios was not more informative. It really wasn't helpful and I had to look elsewhere for the information I needed. I would have appreciated more specific information, examples and directions. The information was to general to be useful and not information on how to actually do it."
1,"Somewhat helpful, but that's all.","I got this book with the hopes it would shed some light on the beginnings of my new business. I was severely disappointed. I had learned more from 30 minutes of talking to a friend of mine than the entirety of this book. One major qualm I had with this book is the uncountable errors, misspellings, punctuation errors and errors in word usage. If it was one or two errors, it would've been ok, but there were probably hundreds(literally), which was extremely distracting to reading. I don't know how this book got through the proof readers! Overall, I would not recommend this book. You can learn just as much by getting on a pressure washing website and reading discussion boards."
4,"Informative, short and to the point","Herman helps lay the foundation for others considering entering the world of the power washing business. It was a quick but informative read of the in's and out's of starting your own business in power washing. I would recommend this others. Quick, to the point and not too technical for the beginner."
4,Great mp3 player,"I now have two of the Lexar LDP-200 players. They are simple to use and the sound is terrific. One AAA battery will last about 15 hours. With SD cards getting cheaper the storage is unlimited. Simple to add music if you have a decent desktop or laptop computer. I use Windows Media Player and just drag and drop the songs (or albums) onto the storage card.The usb connector (comes with the player) makes it even easier.I bought my players for $20 a few months back. They are more expensive now, but may be worth it if you want a reliable and simple player. Being able to use a storage card is a huge advantage. Being able to replace the battery is also a great feature."
2,I was there too,I was on the crew of the Glomar Explorer but I also agreed not to dilvulge details. This is a poorly written book but does have some truth in it. I would like to know how he got away with printing it.
3,?,"(to the reviewer below me) : so how do you explain the fact that you personally signed a contract saying you would never even divulge the words ""jennifer project"" when you have just done it in print for all the world to see? it seems to me that you are either dumb or are making it up."
2,Jennifer Project: I was there,"I have immensely enjoyed all the speculation concerning the Russian Golf submarine. I have but one question for the author. I was personally involved in the ""Jennifer Project"" while serving in the United States Navy. When I left the program due to PCS orders, I was debriefed by the CIA. I signed and have upheld my promise to ""never"" divulge anything about the ""Jennifer Project"" including those words ""Jennifer Project"" to anyone.I'd like to know how the author, claiming to be a former CIA employee can get away with writing a book about this program without spending the rest of his life in prison for violating a security agreement."
3,Error prone,"A so-so mix of fact and speculation with a lot of errors. This, and most books about the recovery of the K-129 have been made obsolete by the public the release of project details, photos and videos of the operation. The definitive work on the project isProject Azorian: The CIA and the Raising of K-129by Norman Polmar. There's also an excellent documentary,Project Azorian: The CIA and the Raising of the K-129, which has interviews with key participants and actual videos of the raising of the K-129."
4,Enlightening,"The Jennifer Project tells the whole story. It's the only source I've located that takes the project from the initial legal issues, which almost killed it, through the actual sub recovery and the subsequent exposure of the mission. How he got all this info must be a tale in itself."
5,Best fan I have ever bought,"Just buy this fan, use it to dry floors, move air, lower your air conditioning and heating bills, whatever. It's really amazing you get so much air flow from such a small fan."
4,Why companies win & lose,"Discusses 3 important categories of Corporate IQ(or how perceptive are those who work for the organization & their willingness to adapt to the competitive environment) and their subcategories:A)Strategy1)Marketing2)Innovation3)Product Technology4)Product PortfolioB)Organization5)CEO Attributes6)Managers7)Culture8)Formal Structure9)Intelligence Systems10)Corporate Strategy11)Attitude towards Change12)Internal Technology ApplicationsC)Character13)Values14)Ethics15)Value of People16)Excellence Rating17)Quality and ProcessHe does a good job of discussing companies that have high IQ's, such as Southwest Airlines, Costco, Mary Kay, AG Edwards, Dell, Kingston, & Lens Crafters/Sunglass Hut.A good read that helps the reader assess his own organization's IQ w/ a quiz at the end of book."
5,"""The beloved Disciple""","George builds a very strong case that the gospel of John was not written by the apostle John but rather by a very close friend of Jesus named Lazarus. He methodically examines all of the references in the Book of John to the phrase ""the beloved disciple"" and concludes that in many cases John could not have been that person and that Lazurus was he. Highly recommended for those bibical scholars looking for a new perspective of the Books of the Bible"
5,Spellbinding Power of Palmistry,"I relished this book because besides the lines this also shows the whorls, heights of fingers, seems to go more into depth of the hands; which wanted me to learn more."
3,Dissapointing,"I bought this book cause I am very interested in palm reading. I had one book, but dont have it anymore, so I was looking for something very similar. Book with pictures, that you recognize everything without any problems. In this book is too much talking for not enough pictures. I expected more than I got. So I will look for another one."
2,info too scattered,"Bought it book intended to give it to a 5 y/o for xmas. I looked through the book and found the info to be too scattered. It's arranged by: intro, info about dinosaurs, and time period. Each page has bits of info here and there. Personally, I just did not like the arrangement of info. If you are looking for a book with a different dinosaur on each page with some info about them, this is not the book for you."
4,She loves it,I ordered this book for my 5 year old grandaughter. She loves it!!! we have to read from it every night before she goes to bed.
2,Terrible A-D-D Version,"The book is full of great facts and interesting artwork, there is no doubt about that.However, as I flip through the book, it becomes obvious the books writing philosophy models a MTV video.There are so many disjointed facts combined with smarmy quirky bits that often lead the reader confused.I truly detest the short quip talk soup bubbles where the editors assume you cannot pay attention more than 5-10 seconds at a time."
4,A fun engaging learning tool for young readers as a reference reading source,DK have gone through a whole array of information books in its series this next book in the series is a information knowledge factual learning tool reference on prehistoric earth and its inhabitants on earth the incredible dinosaurs! Ancient large and small powerful beasts that no longer exist in a wide variety of bright and dark colours but have still captured the fascinating creative skillful imagination of palaeontologists and readers to come in a lifetime of these amazing weird colourful creatures.All in all a must have basic information learning tool resource with the only let down being that it is too bloody and gory in some of its pictures of prehistoric wildlife.Still it is nonetheless a start for young readers to get interested into prehistoric wildlife and its abundance of educated learning knowledge in it.
3,encyclopedia?,"A few supposed scientists allegedly dig up some giant bones and we're all supposed to believe in dinosaurs? Well, I'm not buying it. Scientists are always coming up with bogus theories.Dinosaurs are only a theory or an exciting myth. It's not right calling this book an encyclopedia. Calling this book an encyclopedia creates the impression that dinosaurs are a proven fact, when they are not a proven fact.If you believe in The Bible, why would you want your children growing up believing in dinosaurs? Where in The Bible does it say that dinosaurs roamed the Earth?I'm giving this book three stars because there are a lot of nice pictures. If you like dinosaurs, and don't care that they didn't really exist, then you'll probably like this book."
4,7 year old loves it,I bought this as a gift to a 7 year old that loves Dinosaurs. She loved it and still reads it a year later. The book started break down after a while though but I think that is normal with anything you give a 7 year old.
5,Japamation,"I suggest this to any amine fan as it contains the drama, action, and intrigue that any good story should. Now you ask yourself, ""If this one has what all good stories should.The legend begins when a mysterious blond stranger confronts a teenager girl Yuoko, and she is pulled into another world to face her destiny. Thus begins Yuoko's perilous and mystic journey to the Kingdom of Kei on an epic road of espionage, terror, and betrayal."
3,Slow epic that eventually pays off,"I had a difficult time getting into this series at the start. The main character was whinning about why is she in this dilemma so much I had to stop watching it until I had regained my patience. Had to fast forward through a few episodes which is never a good sign. There are some very nice moments here and there that make it worth watching.For the price of this series, I'm not sure if it's a great investment. If there was a novelized version, I'd get that instead. Perhaps it's just I'm not the right audience for this, because it's a highly recommended series and a lot of people like it."
2,OK- but 2004 COMPLETE Moscow Symphony recording is MAGNIFICENT!,"THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD complete film score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold and performed by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra is the most magnificent rendition of this remarkable, hauntingly beautiful music. COMPLETE is the key word here as the Moscow Symphony performance has not edited the score for time considerations. John Morgan of Marco Polo Classic Film Music Series has restored bars of music previously taken out, and returned to the original full orchestration the score deserves. Don't buy this old, almost tinny recording when an infinitely better rendition awaits you.It is available through Amazon. Play the previews and hear the difference!The Adventures of Robin Hood, film scoreComposed by Erich Wolfgang KorngoldPerformed by Moscow Symphony OrchestraConducted by William T. Stromberg"
4,Korngold sets the proper mood for Robin Hood,"The soundtrack for 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' is outstanding. You can almost see in your mind what action is taking place. Korngold did numerous scores for various movies, but none as great as the ones starring Errol Flynn."
1,Nothing is as good as the original,"I do not own any of the ""rehashes"" of the Adventures of Robind Hood soundtrack. However, I feel with the soundtrack I do own, I can say that this soundtrack and any others are terrible compared to what I have. I'm sure they're okay since I assume they are professionals, but the soundtrack I'm going to tell you about is the best out there.This soundtrack is the COMPLETE, ORIGINAL, and OFFICIAL recording of The Adventures of Robin Hood conducted by the composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold. This cd was never intended for a public release, but it is now thanks to the guys at Tsunami doing their best to convert any old movie soundtracks that were a vinyl recording onto a cd without skimping out on the original sound. This soundtrack sounds just as well as you hear it in the movie.Anyone who is looking for the original soundtrack can find it by searching with the serial number: Tsunami TSU 0139. Expect to look hard for a while and have to deal with foreign money. [...]."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book at a superficial level appears to be intelligently written. If you are a scientist who has studied human sexuality you will know what a sham this book is. The author apparently doesn't understand the fundamentals of the field, like minimal parental investments and its evolutionary consequences. Don't buy this book."
3,WHATCA GONNA DO,"From the Clyde Mcphatter era, you can't leave 'Whatcha Gonna Do' off the listAnd frome the Ben E King era, you can't leave 'Oh My Love' off the listToo much filler. And I love me some Drifters"
5,Stunning!,A fantastic collection of the 60s and 70s funk/soul combo's greatest hits. A couple of mediocre slow numbers but for the most part this is a delight for anyone with an interest in funk and breaks. Can you afford to miss this?
4,"So far, so good","I must say, the assembly instructions were horrendous! However, with a little common sense, one can easily figure out how to put this tent up. Seems like a nice quality and sturdy tent, so far. Perfect size for two people with ""stuff."""
2,Tough and Deadly REVIEW,"After joining forces in 1993's ""Back In Action"", Billy Blanks and ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper reunite for this dismal follow-up. This time, Blanks is a special agent with amnesia and Piper is the bounty hunter trying to keep him alive long enough to figure out who he is.The action sequences aren't as spectacular this go around and the story gets tired fast. Fans of either may want to check out but overall, it's very underwhelming."
1,The ultimate no hoper.,"Billy Blanks is a poor man's Wesley Snipes.Wesley Snipes is a poor man's Eddie Murphy.A lot of people find Eddie Murphy very irritating. Even as a movie aimed squairely to demonstrate the martial arts and brawls, this is a very boring and cack handed affair."
3,"We love this, BUT...","My five-year-old loves this bus, and carries it everywhere with him, to the point we have a spare in case it gets forgotten at home.HOWEVER- it is supposed to be a pull-back motion toy, and that breaks pretty quickly. I wish they just put normal wheel on it lie a hotwheels car and left it at that."
5,An important tool for graphic designers,"Brochure Design That Works deserves a very high recommended as an important tool for graphic designers and business executives charged with the responsibility for creating effective, attractive brochures. Nationally and internationally recognized brochures demonstrated here for efficiency range from corporate client work to institutional, educational and arts brochures. Individual chapters probe each completed work for the elements which make it a success, from its initial idea to technical aspects of its production."
3,An okay presentation of different genres,"This is a decent collection of different works, offering a wide array of samples to, well, sample. Nothing too radical here, nothing too memorable, nothing too exemplary of really anything. Kind of a safe play in presenting nice designs of safe works. Worth perusing, perhaps not purchase, though?I give them credit for including descriptions of the product and why the designers went with certain designs in the end. But, in the end, it was still just a brief look over a bunch of different brochures with nothing. If you're looking for a rainbow of styles, this is for you."
2,The designs are quite regular,"I dont really like the content, the designs are not really creative, the one who design or did the book layout, didnteven seem like an artist. I would have returned the book, if the shipping fee did not cost more than the book itself. You can just check out the other books on brochure designing, that might be better."
4,Works fine but sensitive to dirty/scratched discs,"I bought this DVD player as my second one to use in my bedroom. Overall, I'm quite happy with its quality in both audio and video. It's not a high-end model but I believe it would serve your need well if you just want to switch from VHS to digital to get a much better audio/video signals. This player has also the capability of playing CDR and CDRWs that can't be found in other similar players. It's surely a plus. Only one drawback I found with this DVD player is that it seems too sensitive to dirty/scratched discs. If you intend to watch DVDs from rental places like NetFlix.com watch out for those old and scratched discs due to heavy usage.I'd like to mention that it's hard to detect the differences in quality between this DVD player and others in the same price range if you don't have high-end stereo/video systems hooked up with it. In conclusion, except you do have expensive high-end audio/video systems, this DVD is a good buy."
1,Worst investment ever made,"I had the same problem as the other reviewer in this section. The damn thing just stopped working. It goes to show you that Philips doesnt know a damn thing about ""Quality"". Why should I go through the trouble of returning a piece of crap. This was maybe the worst decision I have ever made trying to save a buck. Trust me it's worth spending that extra [money] to get a top quality brand ie,""Sony""."
1,Worst Choice I Made Buying This,"All I can say is that I am very displeased with this item. I purchased one of these Dvd players in October, got it and set it up, picture and color faded in and out. From my experience with this product I would advise you to look at other players and not purchase this one."
3,It Quit after 9 months,"After very light usage during the past 9 months, it suddenly quit working. Philips will replace it for a ""Reasonable"" charge...plus... shipping charge after I send it to them via UPS at my cost. I'm tempted to just dump it with a note saying ""PARTS ONLY"" to a second hand store and get a different kind, brand new from Amazon... I can't see paying [this money] every 9 months just to keep replacing a faulty DVD player."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"This is a good BASIC DVD player. Some people have complained about the load times, but I did not see this as a problem. The picture, sound and ease in hooking it up were selling points. Don't expect it to be top-of-the-line, and you won't be let down."
5,intriguing and informative...educating those unfamiliar,"having had no exposure to the hardcore scene before, this documentary opened my eyes to an interesting and exciting world of music and culture..."
5,What 1990's punk rock is and should be.,"A compilation of many of the 'Turks singles, Pissin' Out The Poison is a must for any fan of REAL rock 'n roll. The songs barrel out of your speakers and crush you beneath their overpowering force. Faster than the Ramones, harder than AC/DC and more out of control than Iggy, yet with a connection to Rolling Stones style basic rock 'n roll. The 'Turks have properly reclaimed hardcore punk from heavy metal/thrash to its rightful home in the garage."
4,New Bomb Music,I WILL SAY THAT THE BOMB TURKS DO DELIVER A STOMPING BRAND OF FOOT-TAPPING ROCK AND ROLL.THIS COMPILATION OF THEIR OLD SINGLES WILL HAVE YA SINGING AND ASKING FOR MORE. THIS RELEASE OUT-DOES ANY OF THEIR CURRENT RELEASES OF THE PAST FEW YEARS. IT IS A GOOD BUY. NO REGRETS.
1,"Commands for Use With IEEE Std 488.1-1987, IEEE Standard Dig","IEEE Standard Codes, Formats, Protocols, and Common Commands for Use With IEEE Std 488.1-1987, IEEE Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instr"
5,fascinating study,"I highly recommend this book. Bates demonstrates the link between the theory of evolution (which includes the Big Bang Theory), UFO phenomena and the New Age (many-ways-to-God) Movement. He explains how beliefs which have come from the NAM are but a new form of an ancient evil and are designed to prevent people from knowing the truth and God and His Word. I was an agnostic and a believer in evolution for most of my adult life and only recently came back to Christ. So I understand how belief in ""historical science"" theories can undermine your faith. For more information, go to creation dot com and/or Alien intrusion dot com."
3,Good for beginners,"I'd say this book is excellent for beginners, as he's done his research and provides a good historical review of the phenomenon. Where I was disappointed was in his speculations at the end, in effect saying ""The Devil made me do it."" I cannot fathom how anyone can read John Mack's works and recent contactee case histories and not appreciate the overwhelming spiritual elements or the enlightenment coming from this movement."
5,mcqueen,"good movies, on time shipement, good price, good value,i would recemend to a friend, i have watched all of the movies"
3,Good movies,I didn't personally buy thses for myself they were a gift but my fathe rin law loved them and thoguht the series was fantastic.
4,Essential Steve McQueen Collection,I always love a collection of movies from a particular actor and this one is great for Steve McQueen. Not sure if it has all of his best but it is a good start. Now I just need to watch the entire set.
5,Simply Wonderful Entertainment !,If you're a Steve McQueen fan (and who isn't) this collection should be on your shelf at home the your viewing pleasure.
5,Wonderful Value,"For those of us who enjoy and respect Steve McQueen's acting ability, this collection is almost faultless. ALMOST, because 'Never So Few' has been included in the collection - obviously to sell an unsellable movie!Bullitt, The Getaway, The Cincinnati Kid, Papillon and Tom Horn are acknowledged classics - rightly so. However, Never so Few is unadulterated rubbish, from first to last.In fairness, however, one has to say that the 5 excellent movies make the cost of this 'Collection' well worth while.Fans of Steve McQueen and those who enjoy quality movies with good acting and good scripts will delight in this 'Collection' - in spite of the putrescent Never so Few!"
4,"More chinks in the cholesterol only theory, needs dbl blinds","This book adds more chinks in the armour to the Cholesterol theory of heart disease. The author has lots of experience, but fails to mention many double blind tests on meat eating... particularly on fat consumption. The author does present lots of information on various groups that are healthy and are meat eaters (Eskimos, tribes in Africa). He also presents some longevity statistics of vegetarians vs. meat eaters... that favors the meat eaters. I think the definitive book has yet to be written, and the cause of atherscerlosis remains to be determined. Overall I thought it was a good book and I'll keep it next to my Ornish/McDougal - vegetarian-style, low-fat books.Easy to read, well organized.John Dunbar"
2,"If statistics are your thing, this is your book","I had to read this book for preliminary work for my upcoming year in Paris. The title makes it seem like it would be somewhat interesting. Granted, I'm not that much interested by politics and things of that nature but I thought I'd be able to reasonably get through this book. However, there was only one small section on language and culture that actually peaked my interest. I thought that the bulk of the book was taking up by Hargreaves throwing statistics about ethnic groups in France and not so much analyzing these stastics or how to better the situation of these groups. However, if you like politics and statistics this is the book for you. Students writing on this subject might find it helpful as well to quote statistics from for their own analytical work."
5,Great Chairs,Easy to blow up and deflate. We keep them on the boat and use them when we anchor and swim around for the day.I bought the lounge versions also. Good quality.
1,Poor,Within 3 hours this cair was already ripped and it was not overused***It was just from sitting in it****Would NOT recommed it for the moeny they want**
1,nightmare,It was the worst inflatable device I have ever bought.I returned it because I assumed I recieved a defective one as it lost air the second day..Kindly I was sent a replacement..Guess What!!!!!!!!The same thing happened..I would not reccomend this product
2,Disappointed - product ripped in no time,"Wish I had read some of the other reviews prior to purchasing because if I had, I would have been concerned about the quality. Similar to several other people who purchased this product, I'm disappointed because after approximately 2 hours of use (translation: simply sitting calmly in the water), the stitching has ripped open on one of my floats (I purchased two). Generally speaking, I wasn't thrilled with the actual product to begin with (size of backrest, etc.) but for the price I wasn't going to bother returning it. Now that it ripped just from climbing in and out maybe a dozen times, I'd recommend to anyone who is thinking about purchasing this item that they look for something else."
1,kelsyus floating chair rippped after an hour in the pool.,"We looked forward to receiving the inflatable chair so we could read in our new swimming pool. We purchased several floaters and two chairs, received them, and then filled them with air. It was only after a few minutes in the pool that we noticed the nylon had ripped. Very disappointing!"
2,Disposable,You can only count on getting one or two seasons from this float. We've had 3-4 and they all leaked. The fabric cover is great as it doesn't stick to your skin when hot but it also keeps you from getting to the vinyl to patch the leaks. We have the chaise version too and haven't had the same leaking problem as the chair. The chaise is a little more difficult to get into and I prefer the chair. But I'm not going to waste my money on another one.
1,Junk,"We bought 2 of these for our pool. They both were great for about 1 1/2 months before both started to leak air along their seams. They lasted just long enough to fall off Amazon's return policy. Beware the money spent on these is wasted, they did not last 2 months."
2,first two defective,"Ordered two of these pool floats. Both were defective and would not hold air. Called the company and they did provide replacements at no cost and both of these were OK. Still, that is only a 50% rate on quality."
3,Radio Gold,ACE comes through as usual except for the linear notes which don't exsist. I knew this before ordering but still a dissapointment. CD sounds great as ACE continues excellancy. I'm giving 3 stars for lack of linear notes.
5,Nothing like an original...,The original battery is so much better than the after-market ones I bought for less money.
2,Disappointing after JumpStart Baby,"Our son loves JumpStart Baby, with Teddy, and the ease of ""press any key"" to make things work. JS Toddlers often doesn't give you a clue if it wants a key to be pressed or the mouse to be clicked - at least Teddy would politely remind you of what to do, whereas the duck will just stand there and tap its foot impatiently, which I just find annoying. A little verbal prompting would go a long way! Graphics and sound weren't as smooth as JS Baby, either - it's very jumpy, skips, etc."
1,Buyer Beware - May not work on your computer,"I love the JumpStart line of products. I purchased this for my child and tried to install in on a computer that operates on Windows XP. No luck. The sys req are for Win 95/98. Tech support says that it MAY not work on the XP sys, but should on older versions. So I pulled an old computer out of storage that has Win 95 on it. No luck there either. Tech support won't help because they no longer support Win 95. Maybe it would work on Win 98, but I give up. This is the 3rd disc from Knowledge Adventure that I have encountered problems like this on...and I am pretty handy with computers."
2,Diappointing,This game is very disappointing. There is actually very little to do and see. It requires a parents help to point and click the mouse and has very little interaction. Other CD's capture my 21/2 year olds attention for 3x as long. It is rather expensive and keeps a young childs attention for only 10-15 minutes. I read several other reviews saying it would be better for older kids - but my 5 year old daughter complains the CD is boring with nothing to do. I suggest Reader Rabbit or Fisher Price Little People instead.
4,"I LIKE ALL THE SOFTWARE THIS COMPANY PUTS OUT, ON THE OTHER","HAND I HAD TO BE CAREFULTO NOT USE THE COMPUTER AS A BABY SITTER! AND AS FOR IT BEING FOR TODDDLERS... (18 MONTHS )... AND UP PUL-EEEEZ! TAKE YOUR 18 MONTH OLD BABIES OUT SIDE! DONT SIT THEM IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER SCREEN. This company makes alot of fine, fine software and this is no exception but marketing it to what I consider to be babies is a bit much... it can't be good for them and I know it's not good for my keyboard....apple juice doesn't clean up well. Buy this program but wait till they are a little older...."
2,The CD won't work in my Windows 98 or my Mac Os X.,I cannot return it either (J&R policy). What a rip--no wonder it was only $10--it won't work in any of the current operating systems. DON'T BUY IT!
2,Don't Walk Away.....,"Your little one might be cruising the Web with this software!If the feather (used as a pointer) winds up on the right side of the screen, there's an option to go to the Jumpstart website. The next thing you know, your sweet little baby is pushing keys, opening your browser, and going online. I think it's very strange that this software that's geared to toddlers tries to take them online.My daughter (3 1/2) likes the duck, but she really hasn't figured out how to get from one place to another on this. I find it difficult to navigate, myself. All in all, this isn't that great. And having to worry that the Jumpstart program will open up my Internet browser is pretty bizarre."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"We bought this for our 2 year old daughter for her birthday as she had been expressing interest in using the ""puter"". This program is easy to install and run however we are somewhat disappointed that it isn't easier for our daughter to use on her own. The feather that is used as the pointer is small and somewhat difficult to follow and it isn't always clear what the activites require you to do. Our daughter does ask quite often to play with this, however, she usually ends up watching mommy or daddy as we need to move the mouse for her to get from one activity to the next. Additionally, the sound often skips (especially in the ABCs) although I don't really think that our daughter notices. It does offer a great range of activities, but given that it is marketed to 18 months and up, we feel the navigation could be made a lot better."
5,Excellent game for toddlers,"It works with Windows 2000, even though the box says you need Windows 95/98. It knows how to set up the video mode automatically, and restores the screen correctly when you return to Windows 2000. (Other games such as Reader Rabbit appear in a small box on the screen when you do not have 640x480 resolution.)"
1,"Worst comic book adaptation since ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen""","There have been many bad comic book movies but few have come from such great source material as ""Whiteout."" The Greg Rucka comic book is one of the best investigative thrillers out there, but this movie is just terrible. It's boring, the actors are terrible and even a Syfy Channel knockoff would have known to have some action or something in it to make it watchable. This tries to be a more serious capital F ""Film"" at times like the great comic but just comes off boring. I could barely stay awake and ended up fastforwarding through most of it. Though Rucka's ""Queen & Country"" would make a great film series and put ""Bourne"" and ""Bond"" to shame, if it's done as poorly as this I'm glad it hasn't happened. One star only because there are no zero star reviews."
1,bad item,"Received the movie just before an extended trip so I didn't have time to watch. Got back after the return time was up and discovered the dvd, which showed no marks, would not play. The disc is the correct reagion and everything. Not pleased that I bought a movie only to be given a defective product that I'm unable to return. The disc should have been tested for funcionality before being sent out."
2,A Whitewash,"Man, this was one, long tedious movie. You've probably read all the other criticsms, and I agree with them. I gave it two stars instead of one because (1) it had the semblance of a plot, and (2) I was surprised toward the end as to who the bad guy was. I also liked the ""heck with physics"" part:POSSIBLE SPOILER! POSSIBLE SPOILER!You're after a guy who is trying to escape by plane. You get there, and he's gone: somehow he got by you and was headed back from whence you came. Reminds me of an MST-3K laugher (Wild Rebels), when the cops set up a roadblock but somehow forgot about one of the roads (easily seen by anyone). How did that guy get past them?OK, I'm going to mention the nudity part. What in the heck did that add to the plot? Why is it this young lady straps on a gun but would rather run from someone than use it? Does she have no hand-to-hand combat training? And the whining..."
3,rosy cheeks,"Am I the only one bothered by the fact that all the characters were running around outside in -55 degree weather with bare faces?! Other than that, the movie is pretty standard fare for its genre with a no surprise ending."
4,Whiteout,"For U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko, things are about to get even more dangerous. The only law enforcement in this unforgiving territory, she has just been sent to investigate a body on the ice. Antarctica's first homicide. A shocking discovery in itself, it will plunge her into an even more bizarre mystery and the revelation of secrets long-buried under the endless ice--secrets that someone believes are still worth killing for. As Stetko races to find the killer before he finds her, winter is already closing in. In the deadly Antarctic whiteout, she won't see him till he's a breath away. The outside shots are beautiful. The whole idea of being on Antarctica was fascinating. I think this movie will give you the kind of intelligent thriller fans of this genre of movies enjoy. This movie is more tasteful than a slasher movie but still just as gut-wrenching."
2,Antarctic ignorance,"This movie had the potential (and budget) to be a decent thriller. As someone who has spent a lot of my life in the Arctic, I wonder why they couldn't have bothered to hire an environmental advisor, or simply Google what it's like to be exposed to extreme cold? Or at least be consistent? I.E: frostbitten fingers turned black immediately after exposure and had to be amputated, while faces exposed to much longer periods of cold weren't white, red or even chapped. Hey, anyone out there tried to even move their lips after coming in from extreme cold? Guess we wouldn't want to miss any of that brilliant dialogue. .."
5,Whiteout Keeps You Guessing,"I really enjoyed the movie ""Whiteout"" that is filled with mystery and action, as did my family. It starts with a story a bit similar to a few other movies but keeps you guessing each minute as to who or what the bad guys are. This movie filled with suspense and action is a favorite of ours. Well written screenplay and the actors are very believable in their character rolls and portral. The twists and turns leave you wanting more and the ending may surprise most of you. If you like action, mystery, suspense and a sound script with great acting, watch ""Whitout.""Satisfied Carol in Virginia USA"
3,Great Opening sequence,"The opening scene of the Russian aircraft going down is wonderful. Watch for Julian Cain, he will be a star soon."
4,TRIED & TRUE!,"Yes, it is virtually the same story as always - people confined in small space, it's REALLY cold, there is an unseen threat, someone goes crazy, some running, some blood, pretty girl makes it to the finish line - the end. And, we liked it!"
2,WHITEOUT IS A STRIKEOUT,"Kate Beckinsale plays a U.S. Marshall stationed in Antarctica. (Do they have them there?) She investigates a murder which develops into a series of murders including an attempt on her life. The number of suspects is slightly more than a Scooby-Doo episode, but not by much.The film opens with a Russian plane crash in 1957, then shifts to the present with a gratuitous scene of Kate peeling off layers of clothes to take a shower. However, that is not the ""some nudity"" promised in the rating box. It is male streakers. Yup. So don't get your hopes up.In addition to the murders, Kate has to battle the elements as well as frequent annoying Miami flashbacks, explained about midway through the movie. I found Beckinsale unconvincing in her role. In fact all the characters are stiff without any memorable personality traits. Not worth a view. Soundtrack wasn't that good either."
1,Absolutely Ridiculous!,Only in the movies can a human being go outside in 55 to 65 degrees BELOW zero weather without skin and facial protection with no problems!!!! WHo knew!This movie is beyond stupid. What a waste of time.This one can go back in the freezer!!!
1,I'm tempted to write Gabriel Macht a letter...,"...that goes something like this:""Dear Gabriel Macht,You need to have a talk with your agent. He keeps getting you these s*** parts and you're way better than that. You're talented and you have reassuring puppy dog eyes. I love you. Stop making s****y movies.""Whiteout started out godawful and never got any better. After a while, it numbed me with a constant barrage of bad: bad acting, bad writing, bad direction. The word stultifying comes to mind. And, in a film of this ""quality"", making me wait 35 minutes for Gabriel Macht to appear is just unforgivable. I knew it would be awful, but the promise of Gabriel Macht gets me to watch some awful movies (I'm looking at you, The Spirit). Well, at least what I saw in the trailers and read in the reviews wasn't misleading. It was every bit as terrible as it looked. Bad movie lovers, rejoice; your search is over."
3,WHITEOUT (Kate Beckinsale),"WHITEOUT was an enjoyable movie. Alot of twists and turns and ""WHO DID IT'S"". But without Kate Beckinsale (as always a great actress!) it probably wouldn't have been as good as it was."
3,Mediocre,"Maybe I just expected mroe out of the movie, but I didn't find anything about it to be thrilling, heart pounding, or even unexpected. Just kind of an average movie to watch if you're bored...which I was."
2,A Vast Wasteland!,"What coulda been a contenda for a great thriller about nuclear material missing for over 60 years, turned out to be nothing more than a tired old mystery about valuable gems. The only saving grace was looking at Kate Beckinsale and seeing Tom Skerritt, two actors whose skills were wasted in a wasteland. The setting may have been novel but not the contrived story.And let's get real, going out in 60 below (Centigrade or not) temps for longer than a minute is VERY dangerous!It took four screenwriters to come up with this crap?Unless you have 87 minutes to wile away or don't mind briefly seeing a hottie in her underwear, DO NOT buy, rent or steal this movie."
2,WHITEOUT IS A WASHOUT,"Remember John Carpenters THE THING? The loneliness, the foreboding awe of the polar wilderness, the terror of hopelessness. If you're expecting that kind of feeling from WHITEOUT, you might be as disappointed as me!The plot is almost indiscernible. It's shot so sloppily, there are times you can't even tell what's going on. Kate Beckinsale who CAN act (e.g. THE AVIATOR and NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH) looks totally disinterested; Alex O'Loughlin, Gabriel Macht and Tom Skeritt are flaccid and dull. I had expected more but the problem with WHITEOUT is it's just boring!"
3,"Good landscapes, bad remake of ""The Thing""","Okay, except the airplane crash episode the movie follows all ""The Thing"" control points - from the very beginning and straight to the hole in the ice.After that Mr. Sena tries to do something without Mr. Carpenter's help, but... I just don't want to repeat what was said before - just watch any of those one star reviews.The movie is not that bad, if you like Discovery channel, of course, and Mrs. Beckinsale in the shower supposed to be attractive replacement of bearded Mr. Russel playing chess with computer, but I expected a little bit more from ""Swordfish"" director."
2,***Blackout***You'll***Wish***,"When a movie panders to the star's appeal in one useless elongated opening shower scene, you should know what to expect ahead. Kate's tough gal schtick ran out its welcome not long after she opened her mouth.The unimaginative appearances of the killer, red herring, trap hole, mind-(D)umbing final twist and the 'whiteout', GEEZ.... can these elements be more stupifying cinematically in their timing? Then again, this is the same uber-auteur for Gone in 60 Seconds and Swordfish.One star for the Antarctica setting and one star for the scientists who ran across the pond naked. Who said geeks can't party? Too bad I didnt while watching this, maybe I would have blacked out this crapola."
1,Boring Beyond Belief,"Kate phones in her part and i don't blame her because as soon as she saw the script she probably started laughing, but if someone is going to pay some nice bucks to do a crap movie i think most people would, Dominic Sena really ought to do everyone a favor and retire, this guy can't direct his way out of a paper bag, why does anyone hire him? This pile of dung will be as quickly forgotten as Kate's other ""masterpiece"" from 2008 ""Winged Creatures"" aka ""Fragments"". Kate needs to start making some better career choices before she gets type cast as a ""B Movie"" star - but maybe it's too late."
1,looks like a Made-for-TV movie!,"the plot is very ""scooby-doo"", and not in a good way the way Buffy used to do it...Kate plays and American girl with a troubled past (flashbacks)nothing stands out in this film...except: how did they keep going outside in such temperatures without hoods!"
1,Boring Blizzard and 'Who Dunnit',"Whiteout is a chopped together mess of a murder mystery movie. A murderer at the South Pole must be caught and it happens a U.S. Marshall is stationed there. There were several sub-plots in Whiteout that just did not flow well into the main idea.Whiteout focuses on the activities at Amundsen-Scott Research Station and the exotic setting of Antarctica is the ""hook"" for the movie. The wind and snow are blowing as the first ever murder is discovered.Kate Beckinsale plays the lead as Carrie Stetko, a U.S. Marshall, stationed in the remote station. In the opening scene she has been sent out to investigate the first murder in the snow and ice. She realizes the body must have been thrown from a plane and the investigation begins. Whiteout then produces way too many slasher scenes as well as disjointed logic throughout.The script was uninspired and lifeless as the winter landscape it was set in."
3,An O.K. murder-mystery,"This movie bombed with the critics and at the box office and I'm not sure why. Well I get why critics panned the movie. It's poorly written and not very well acted, but what did the audience expect? Maybe they were thinking this was another remake of ""The Thing"", I don't know. Frankly, once you get past the lame writing and lame premise the movie serves pretty well as a murder-mystery-thriller. Granted I was able to identify the ultimate bad guy but for the usual reason, the other possibility was just too obvious. Park your brain and just go for the ride; it won't hurt even if you chuckle when you shouldn't.The 1080p Blu ray conversion is presented in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio. The look is inconsistent at best. Some scenes look very good, others murky. Still, given the harsh outdoors scenes the video is pretty good. The Dolby TruHD 5.1 on the other hand is excellent."
1,Didn't work,"Kate Beckinsale, Tom Skerritt - cool setting but it adds up to near nothing. Even the basic script was decent but the execution took care of that. A lot of poorly and overdone CGI didn't help much either nor did the actual cause of everything add up. Or the storyline - which in parts was silly.In total a really bad movie in a nice package. Kate and Tom could do nothing to salvage what was or wasn't there."
4,Underground,Great humorous take on the history of Yugoslavia. Hilarious lead characters Marko and Blackie.
5,outstanding...unforgettable,"Spellbinding, moving , comic and tragic at the same time, this movie portraits in a amazingly focussed manner the chaos that is Yugoslavia... its beauties, virtues, its paradoxes, treacheries, its people full of life... when is the DVD coming? (the music by Goran Bregovic is a treat by itself)...."
2,pretty worthless/disconnected,Quite disconnected from my point of view. Hard to know what the heck is going on withour reading the VCR jacket and I'm not sure it was right! Slapstick quality but just too disconnected. No real story.
3,A bit too long.,"An okay film. (Do you people give five stars to absolutely EVERY movie you see?) A little believability problem here: Do you really think that a hundred people would have spent twenty years in a cellar without once wanting to sneak outside for some fresh air and sunshine? Do you really think that these same people would have an extremely LOUD wedding party featuring a brass band without worrying that the Germans would hear all the ruckus and come investigate? The movie runs almost three hours long and could have been editted down. The recently released (in theatres) ""Cabaret Balkan"" is so much better."
2,Palme d'Or? Palme D'OH!,"Those crazy Europeans. They suckered me again. Finally I realize that Europe's prestigious ""Palme d'Or"" award is not awarded based on artistic merit, but rather on political agenda. Take for example this years recipient, ""Farenheit 9/11"". I rest my case.While not as politically in-your-face as F911, ""Underground"" is very much a political commentary. To be honest, I agree with that commentary. But that doesn't change the fact that this is not such a great film. I've never seen such a good plot/theme wasted on such a lousy presentation. The characters are so 2-dimensional that you find yourself not caring about anyone. And if you don't care about the characters, the story becomes pointless.I give it 2 stars (instead of 1) because it was a good effort, and I'm willing to cut Emir Kusturica some slack because he did ""Arizona Dream"", an excellent film which is nothing like this one. My last words of advice: beware of any film Cannes praises!"
5,Tito loves children...I love this film!,"If you only see one foreign film in your life, make sure it is this one. Kusturica's humorous view of war in Serbia is truly a masterpiece. Watch it for the monkey, watch it for the gypsy band playing hanging upside down, watch it for the aptly placed flower arrangement, watch it for the gypsy band playing in a tree, watch for the gypsy band playing while running after at truck...(many Kudos to Goran Bregovic for the excellent score!)"
5,5 stars best movie ever,"Mozart's written music on paper, A Michelangelo sculpture, Mountain Dew (hey I like it), JFK in our hearts and The Thinking Man at the Gates of Hell. This movie fits in with the best of them all. I wish there was a man like Emir Kusturica in every country so he could introduce us to others worlds. Tragic things happen in this movie but yet it is funny. This movie makes you smile but tears come out of your eyes and your heart sinks. The more I think about this movie the more I realise how great it is. This is entertainment at its peak, the ultimate. Hmmm...lets see what other great movie summed up the history of a country...Forest Gump. It doesn't compare to this movie."
3,Over-the-top,"Although I never ""got"" this movie, Underground is a unique and strange movie experience. It seems likely that it conveys aspects of Balkan culture, especially through the music. It is occasionally hilarious. It has great energy, and ends well. So I can see part of Underground's appeal.Even so, I found the humor, irony and satire in Underground to be so over-the-top that much of the movie just seemed silly, and therefore also seemed much too long. There is no mention of the racial divisions that so decimated Yugoslavia in the 90s. And I've seen movies about the region I liked much better, especially Beautiful People by Jasmin Dizdar, and also No Man's Land by Danis Tanovic. It is clear that many people really love Underground: perhaps they really love quirky movies, or have a deeper knowledge or better perspective of the former Yugoslavia. My knowledge of the region is probably typical of Americans; as such, I recommend one of the other movies suggested above."
5,"brilliant, emotional, touching, fantastic acting, and music!","I saw this movie on TV in Ukraine in 95 or 96. I am so happy it has finally been released in the US. I absolutley wept and also roared with laughter with this transedescent picture of Yugoslavia. Maybe it's more poignant knowing the history and culture, but this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Absurd, political, funny, witty, heart-wrenching."
5,This film has become my homeland,"I am a Bosnian refugee of mixed ethnic origin. Without any intention to be melodramatic, I have to say that the loss of my homeland was expressed so purely in Kusturica's film that it tore open old wounds and healed them at the same time. I used to dislike Kusturica's style; now I see how wrong I was."
5,"A superb Flann O'Brien-esque yarn of love, loss and politics","Brilliant! Like a Philip K Dick, Flann O'Brien or Michail Bulgakov novel come to life. Insightful commentary about the relationship between politics and the life of the individual. Moving from full-fledged slapstick to tear-jerk sentimentality in the same scene, simultaneously maintaining a cohesive whole, this movie has phenomenal direction and amazing performances."
3,Big Bill Smith,"First off, I am a big William Smith fan so I can overlook alot when it comes to films I know are ""B"" movies. My biggest complaints are the pan & scan done on this are lousy. There are those scenes where you see someone's shoulder and their heads are out of frame. Some profanity was taken out -- which leads me to believe this was edited tv version. But, let's be real, there will never be a better version of this pretty obscure film. If you loved him in Laredo, as Falconetti in Rich Man, Poor Man and a number of biker films then add this one to your collection to stand alongside Run Angel, Run Invasion of the Bee-Girls, The Losers, the Ultimate Warrior!"
3,Not a Lewton but worth the Shootin',"Saw this for the first time recently. Not bad, but not a Lewton. I became interested in the work of Lewton after the recent TCM festival of his work. Thought this film lacks the serious talent of Lewton, but it can be said to be ""Lewtonesque."" And this may have been deliberate by the film maker. As far as the plausibility of the story...well, in fact, the very thing happened to me recently when I visited my old hometown in California. Only I was not possessed by the spirit of a witch but it turned out to be my kindergarten teacher...who was probably a witch."
5,colorado confidential,i'm sorry i can't review this book i only received them two days ago i've read a few books written by this author so i'm sure i'll enjoy it
2,Deviled egg receipe book,Was rather disappointment that each recipe did not have aphotograph of the finished article. Very seldom do I make anything if there is no photograph to see what the end result will look like. Would not receommend. Wish I had not purchased.
2,The creative well has run dry,"If the title track was indeed written by Dylan, his creative well has run utterly dry. The sledgehammer imagery and juvenile rhyming scheme sound like something you might have come up with at summer camp as a teenager and something that would make you cringe with embarassment when listening to it 20 years later.The second song is pretty, but the lyrics are completely mindless. Disappointing stuff from the artist who wrote Sour Suite and Dreams."
2,NOT WORTH THE BIG MONEY!!!,"My favorite band of the 60's but very poor sound quality makes this disc not worth the $40.00 or so I paid for it.But being a big Blue Cheer fan I have something that not many people own.If you don't own anything by this groundbreaking group,buy Vincebus Eruptum,you won't be disappointed!"
3,All right episode,"The show is called Jackie Chan Adventures... yet at times I felt as if Jade Chan Adventures was a more appropriate title for this show given how annoying Jade could be and how she could get into situations. Instead of taking this episode and using it to explore some history (how did Shendy get free of the Void, to be turned into a statue by Lo Pei?) we get a Jade-centered episode. Blah."
5,Awesome episode,"The search for the Thunder Demon Chi is on, and is in a sunken ship called the Oceanic. The title refers to the ship Titanic of course, but also to the clash between Drago and Jackie and their search for the Thunder Demon Chi, referring to the Clash of the Titans movie of Greek mythology. Drago's team makes a submarine out of their van - scientific impossibility aside, this is an entertaining episode and definitely one of the best in the season."
4,Cute episode,"By accident, the Earth Demon Chi finds a new host, a nerd named Larry who is also authoring/drawing his own comic book. he is a big-time nerd who dreams of being a superhero. With the Earth Demon Chi, he gains the powers of earth and tries to become a superhero... but turns out he is not very good at it! :P"
4,Awww,"So Jade's teacher, Ms. Hartman gets the Sky Demon's chi. However, she was rather nice to Jade, and Jade learns why she is the way she is. Overall a pretty good episode, definitely one of the better ones this season."
4,Les Bon Temps Rule!,"OK. Sorry for the intentionally mangled phrasing on the review title. Jon Cleary smokes the ivories, and this is a fabulous CD. If I were inclined to argue, I might take a *slight* issue with another reviewer's position that this version of ""Big Chief"" is better than Professor Longhair's. Some would call such a claim heresy. I'm only going to say, Wow. This version is fantastic and probably arranged better than anything on the Professor's (much older) albums. (OK. Maybe it IS better.) And the Cleary original ""C'Mon Second Line"" blows the roof off. Yes, it's rather a slim volume for the dollar. But it kicks funky butt, and is a worthy addition to anybody's New Orleans collection."
1,gift wrapping,"I recently bought Alligator Lips & Dirty Rice by Jon Cleary and 100000000 Bon Jovi Fans Cant be Wrong by obviously, Bon Jovi. As these were a present for a friend, i bought & paid for the option of gift wrapping. Lo & behold they turned up butt naked, so to speak. I was never going to be able to time it so they turned up at my friends place exactly on her birthday, so the gift wrapping was important for her to be able to save the gifts for then. Needless to say this wasn't good enough & i'm extremely disappointed.Alligator Lips & Dirty Rice100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong"
1,Disappointed,"I have tried and liked the Maple Pecan flavor so I wanted to give the Strawberry a try. It may have been the batch or the nature of the Strawberries, the cereal tasted stale and the strawberries had a funny cardboard-ish texture. I don't think I would order this flavor again."
4,Rit Special - Pure Delight!,Lee Ritenour proves that he truely is a master at his craft. And his choices of band members says it all...It was a delight to see this performer who is seldom seen on video...Rit is a very versatile guitarist. He plays from one end of the spectrum to the other...definately worth the money!
4,good answer,"I recently purchased this preamp and I like it. I now have real control over my sound. The unit seems solidly constructed, it functions well in general, is low noise and I have nothing bad to report for it, saving perhaps that as a 'preamplifier', it is a little weaker than I expected. At mid level and even above mid gain, it provides just about the same through put to my power amplifier as connecting the source signal directly. But it does a good job of allowing me to adjust EQ, the 'loudness' is excellent and it is a good platform to switch from differing sources. It is nice looking as well. I would buy it readily now knowing what I do."
3,Pyramid PR2500/SEA2500 Preamp,"The Good: Inexpensive - nice case, smooth controls and decent sound. The MIC input allows me to run the output of my electronic drums or bass guitar into the mix to play along. That is the main reason I purchased the unit as I was previously using a mixing board to do this.It has a phono circuit. Probably not top notch, but it is livable.For the price the pre-amp has a lot of features.The Bad: It is rack mount but the height is non standard. It looks like a 1U device but because of the hole layout it takes up 2U (1/2 U below and 1/2 U above are open space. Also the circuit board mounting standoff sticks out below the unit which means even if it were a true 1U unit, you could not flush mount it above anything."
2,Less than desirable sound quality,This Pyramid pre amp looks neat and has enough functions but the quality of sound reproduction is nothing to brag about.I was running the larger Dayton power amp with a pair of Polk TSI 200 speakers.(All from Amazon.) Connected to my PC audio out.I really liked the sound but added the Pyramid pre amp to switch in more sources.Some may not notice and may live with this but I do not like the sound being altered.
2,THE ITEM IN THE WEB SITE NOT IS THE SAME WHEN YOU ORDER,"previously I buy one of those, the picture show source selector with buttons and this model is good , because each source button have light indicator in each function , that model is PR2500/SEA2500. but when I order, the sources selector are switched per knob ""not light indicators"" this model is PR2500/SEA2500X. not liked."
1,Piece of junk Don't waste your money. Their whole product line is terrible!!!,This unit lasted just long enough for the Amazon return policy to expire. I wouldn't waste my money on it. Very poor quality!!!
3,Good for the price,I use this premap with my Alsesis mixer. Track out to the premap so I can create a bass end with along with reference speakers that push out high end sound...not much bass. Play back is great.. You need to experiment to achieve the best response...Great for the money!!
4,Candy Babies crochet book,"Absolutely adorable patterns in this book! The yarn they recommend you use can be a little pricey, but it can be subsituted with other yarns."
3,Single Crochet,"The color suggestions are nice, and the babies are adorable. But it's mostly single crochet with little pattern variation. If you can adapt patterns, it makes a good reference book, as all the schematics are included.Perhaps I'm spoiled, as I have a Jack Frost original book... that I use to adapt to the new yarns.As I love the author's other book, Candy Tots, I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed with this one."
4,Another one from the heart,"Well, like a few of Dan's projects, I wonder at first if this is the one where it just will not live up to his previous standards. He has a lot to live up to each time he sticks something out there. Once again, he delivers!!! The"" Reach haven Postcard"" song is just beautiful and the rest of the tunes connect to give anybody hope that sits at 50 plus hoping that love enters their world finally too. Thanks again, Dan, for putting yourself out there where few artists will or can say it as honestly, melodically, or as cleverly as you always do. Hope you stay well, your job here is not done yet, Thank God!!"
3,"Still a fan, just not of this album","I've owned pretty much everything Dan Fogelberg has put out in either record, diskette, or CD format. I could always count on expired lyrics, some great songs, and lots of good songs on each album.The lyrics on most songs on Full Circle are as thought provoking and memorable as on most of his former work.There is almost no range to Dan's vocals on Full Circle. Everything is done in a fairly flat, almost monotone style. There is also very little energy or passion in his performance of any of the songs.I've played some of the songs on the album about once a month since I received it as a gift several months ago. I enjoy listening to some of the songs. It's kind of like getting in touch with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time. You enjoy being together again, but you're both older, a little tired, and don't really have all that much to say to each other any more."
2,"After all this time, should have been better . . .","As a big Dan Fogelberg fan, I am very disappointed with FULL CIRCLE. The album starts out well with the haunting HALF MOON BAY (too short), the melodic WHEN YOU'RE NOT NEAR ME, and the quiet but likable REASON TO RUN, but it quickly falls into the all too familiar with FULL CIRCLE - hello HIGH COUNTRY SNOWS. ONCE IN LOVE, WHISPERS IN THE WIND, and DRAWING PICTURES are dull and all too reminiscent of the dreadful days of WINDOWS AND WALLS. THIS HEART and ICARUS ASCENDING show a little more imagination, but not much. REACH HAVEN POSTCARD can at least hold its head high. Where the haunting HALF MOON BAY opened the album with so much promise, the dragging EARTH ANTHEM leads us out, wondering what, after so many years, has happened to Dan Fogelberg?"
2,no wonder it took 6 years to be released,I have always been a fan of dan. Even to put up with ridicule when I play his songs on my ipod in public.I read the previous reviews and bought the album. The songs were all written in 1997 and the album not released until 2003 by an obscure label. It appears that there is a reason for the gap and lack of a major label. Sad to say (sounds like a title of a fogelberg song) this album is not worth the purchase price.Evendently the reviews listed are Dan Fanatics and absolutely love the man. I dont think we will ever hear any of these songs on radio. Save your 13.99
2,Guys! A Christmas Shopping Bulletin.,"Think you can't go wrong buying this new Fogleberg CD for your sweetie this holiday season?Think again!As good as this boy's music has worked for you in the past...RUN!....DO NOT WALK...away from this CD as mood music. (Unless, that is, you like being snarled at.)We've all become accustomed to popping in a Fogleberg CD and just dropping our defences...just relaxing into the music. By title and cover photo, ""Full Circle"" promises yet another such indulgence.It is not. Especially with respect to tracks 2-7.Women: Please, please do not expose yourself unquestioningly to this CD on the 1st pass. It will hurt.Besides if you find I am wrong, you can always lose yourself in the promise, THE SECOND TIME THROUGH."
2,Correlle dishes & packing?,"The price of the dishes was ok and the dishes were nice. They were a gift for my son and his wife so I had them shipped to them. They got two sets, the first set arrived ok. The second set was broken. This was shipped back and reshipped and the next set was broken...Evindently they do not know how to pack glassware."
5,Excellent!,Great popular tunes from the 50s and 60s that are only heard now on Sirius or XM. Definitely recommend this one and its companion Vol. 1
5,The bass to listen to.,"As a bass vocalist, I listen to Ghiaurov more often than Siepi, Christoff, Chaliapin...His singing is so legato, so bel canto. The voice is big, rich, vibrant, and simply gorgeous.If you enjoy this cd, i recommend getting Bellini's I Puritani with Ghiaurov, Pavarotti, and Sutherland. Listen to Ghiaurov's ""Cinta di fiori."""
2,Split open in a week,Been looking for a decent replacement that would last. THIS IS NOT IT!The seam between the base and the cloth started splitting within a week of using it. Save your money and look elsewhere.
2,Too hard for carpal tunnel sensitive person,The wrist pad is tooo hard for me to use. I feel like I have large bruises on all contact points when using this wrist pad. I don't find the flat wrist pad ergonomic at all since there are no contours to provide the desired relief. If you have already had nerve issues I do not recommend this one.
1,Horrible Item - Fell apart within the first week!,"I ordered this item to help out in the office - very comfortable at first, but within a matter of days it fell apart! the fabric covering came unglued from the base and all of the gelly substance started coming out from the inside creating a sticky mess all over my desktop. I have had much cheaper and more comfortable wrist rests in the past."
4,For an herbal Supplement It does something,Its no narcotic you wont feel a buzz or anything. But after taking it I would say 3/5 times I notice that I am in a really good mood. Talkative happy and joking around. Sometimes its hard to tell if its the phenyl doing this or just the circumstances or maybe both. But Im pretty sure there is something positive to this product.
4,Loved the movie,"I was glad to find this cd still available, especially since the movie is one of my all-time favorites. My only complaint with it is the fact that the inside cover is very disappointing. It has a few pictures from the movie but the only information on the cover is all about which other movie soundtracks are available from the same company, Varese Sarabande. When I buy a soundtrack, I like to have as much information on the movie as they can squeeze into a cd cover. So, this one's a little bit of a bummer. But....I'm still glad to have the music."
5,A Great Score,"Can the 49 reviewers who preceded me be wrong? Perhaps, but then I'm going to make it an even fifty. This is a very fine soundtrack album whose main theme is compelling in the extreme -- I believe it's used now in television coverage of The Players Tournament. Much but not all of the music consists of variations on that main theme, but the score maintains enough variety and change of mood to be engaging. My only quibble, and it's a very small one, is that while the film is presumably set in the late 1800s or early 1900s in Australia, some of the music has a bit of a modern quasi-pop sound. That effect doesn't last long, and if we take the score just on its own that incongruity really doesn't matter -- it deals with the relation of the music to the actual film. Even with the quibble I'd give it five starts."
5,Just Love It.,The soundtrack takes me back to the movie. It provides great inspiration when I play it while covering long distances on my horse. It keeps me motivated to continue.
1,Chain him back !!!,"This is the second of Reeves' Hercules movies. You can tell he really wasn't interested in making the film. However, if you can find the MST3K version, in which it is being lampooned, the movie then becomes a classic. Worth watching if you are into bad cinema (like me), otherwise it's a stinker."
4,The Herc is back!,"I greatly enjoyed this DVD - the colors were vivid and the sound was strong. There was only one problem. If you select chapters, chapter 1 starts 15 minutes into the movie. Not a big deal if you plan to watch it all the way through, and I didn't check the other chapters (there were only 4 listed) to see if they match. For the money spent, not much to quibble over."
1,Damaged goods,Didn't even bother to put this SCRATCHED/DAMAGED DVD into player wasn't worth the effort you get what you pay for.
2,The Golden Age of the Herc,"If you like poorly made movies from the 50s and 60s then the Hercules movies are good ones. This is the second movie that featured Steve Reeves as the title character and he was clearly the best of the lot. The way he looked and moved and spoke, you could really believe he was Hercules.In this movie Herc and his wife and young Ulysses are headed to his home city of Thebes when they get sidetracked. Herc drinks from an enchanted pool of water and forgets who he is. He ends up with Queen Omphale, convinced he is married to her. Ulysses pretends to be Herc's deaf mute servant and tries to restore the Big Man's memory. There are other political elements to the plot but not much of it makes sense. Herc flexes his muscles, Omphale flexes her cleavage and there is a big free-for-all fight scene at the end. Hercules ends up back with his wife Iole and everyone lives happily ever after. The acting is cheesy, the direction erratic and the script bizarre."
1,Bad quality digital transfer,"This DVD is produced by Westlake Entertainment Group. It runs for 107 minutes and is presented in the fullscreen format. There is an interactive menu that includes scene selection, photo gallery and very short biographies and filmographies.The real problem is that the digital transfer used Westlake Entertainment Group is very poor quality. The resultant film imagery is like a very old VHS tape.I would not recommend you buy from this distributor. This is symptomatic of a wider problem in which classic films that were made before the advent of the digital age are being treated disgracefully by producing bad low budget DVDs transfers. Show some respect to the director, actors and movie viewer and do it properly or dont do it at all and leave the market open for some other distributor to do it the way it should be done."
5,4 Disk delight,"If you don't love these 4 CD's of music, then you don't like Canadian Music. Period. None of these disk is ""Crap"" as mentioned in earlier reviews. This set (and its retarded little brother Oh What a Feeling 2) are mainstays on my MP3 player. I bop to the stuff my much older sibs and cousins loved (first half of disk 3). I rock to the stuff I grew up with (disks 1 and 2, and some of 4). The later tracks on disk 3 still bring a sentimental tear to my eyes everytime! Ok Celine and K.D. make me barf, but this is gold!I think it is OOP - find a way to get your hands on it!"
4,Great Resource,"This books is a ""manual"" on facilitation that prepares you very quickly. Great examples, good checklists, good index - well worth the price. My only quibble is a small one: charge a few dollars more and improve the paper and printing quality."
3,"Kind of a joke, but you can make it work","Packaging was inadequate as others have stated. Luckily no real damage, but I only have 3 of the 16 screws I need for the casters. I was annoyed at this at first... then I tried one, only to find that they hadn't even tapped the holes anyway! lol. Off to home depot for some bolts and nuts.If you're getting this for music gear, like me, and you're used to racks made for music gear, be aware that your music rack screws aren't going to work, and the nut inserts and screws you need for this are far more pricey. This comes with a set of 20 screws and nuts. Be prepared to spend another $50. I wasn't aware of this difference. Now you are. :) Search for ""cage nuts and screws"" and save yourself another few days of waiting when you order."
3,Nightie,"Very pretty, but think that this would be better if it had actual cup sizes, ie : 16C or 18DD etc as it is an underwire and reasonably specific for breast size."
5,I love it!,I might not have the best chest but this made me look hot! So much so that i can't wait to get it back from my ex's house! A Must!
5,what a scene! what a CD!,"Legal Weapon's assets are its songwriting and Kat Arthur's vocals. Their sound is based around buzzsaw guitar that creates a raw powerful sound that back powerful lyrics that focus on the dark shadows of underground life. The bets of which are the comments on how women were treated (badly, by the way) in this so-called openminded hardcore punk scene.This CD will blow your safety pins off and hopefully the trashy tattoos off anyone else. Get it and learn about the LA punk scene beyond the Germs and Black Flag."
3,O NO! Do I have to (gag) take my cod liver oil again?,"Actually, the regular doestn't taste that bad, and Vitamin D is a must for winter blues. This brand has all the goodies at a great price."
5,Worked great!,"Went to the Carribean Islands and went snorkeling 3 times with my wife, and our two daughters(7 and 8 years old). These worked great for all 3 excursions on various islands. My wife and the girls did not submerge, but I did and it worked as described. The valve would auto shut and I was able to go down 7-8 feet and come up with no problems. My wife and the girls had great fun just snorkeling above water, with their faces fully submerged at all times checking out the abundant sea life.Can't wait to go back again....great buy for the price, not 100% water proof, but worked as well as expected. Would definitely recommend to others."
4,Good Value,"This Snorkel is not totally dry, but blows out easily enough and is a very good value for the price. I did not see any of the problems with the mouth attachment that one of the previous reviews noted. The mouth piece is comfortable and seemed secure to me. I would recommend this product as an inexpensive alternative to renting the ones on the beach from venders when you get to your vacation destination."
1,Defective,"I ordered two of these, and I'm glad I tried them out in the pool before going on vacation. The clear, flexible joint piece was leaking at both ends, on both snorkels. There is clearly a manufacturing defect in this product, and I'm just glad I was able to get a full refund."
1,It leaked,"I was pleased to receive the snorkel I ordered within a few days. After receiving my GetWetStore blue prescription mask that I also ordered thru Amazon, I was disappointed that the snorkel was not a good match in color to the blue mask, but I can live with that. A few weeks later I headed off to Santa Catalina island for a week of snorkeling and kayaking. I snorkeled completely on the surface of the ocean but had a lot of trouble with the snorkel filling up with water. It was difficult to blow out/purge the water and it would fill up right away again. I ended up borrowing a snorkel for the rest of the week."
4,i like them!,awesome goggles but they felt a little tight on the nose and i don't really have a big nose :)
3,could be improved,"This camera bag fits the camera it was made for nicely, but in my case-I have 3 children who dance, play sports, etc. I like to carry as much extra stuff as i can, including spare charged up batteries plus charger. Therefore, although it has ample padding, there is not enough space and compartments and padding for they extra stuff you need."
1,Do Not Buy!!,I purchased this product and had to return it twice. It is still not working correctly! It does not switch files correctly.Lexar sent me a replacement with no improvement. Spend the extra cash. Don't buy a Lexar MP3's!
4,Really nice and soft,"I bought this as a present for my girlfriend, it is really nice and soft. i loved the smell and she loved it too. she likes the little lotion because she can carry that on her purse and use it all day long. Very nice product, arrived on time."
2,Hardly has any smell,"I read the ingredient in it and thought it would be a perfume that I would like, but it is like water down toilet water. Even if you put on five or six sprays...you can barely smell anything. So now I have a big bottle of...hardly smell...lol."
4,the very best of nat king cole,nat king cole excellent singer! ramblin rose is one of my favorites it'snot on this cd but it's good!
1,not Greatest Hits,"As was mentioned this CD does not have ""Ramblin' Rose"" or ""Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer."" Try another one."
4,Glad I tried,"Sometimes when you buy a ""best of"" it often isn't, or I find that I don't like the singer as much as I thought I might despite the couple seconds you can listen to before purchasing. You see I tried a Natalie Cole DVD couple years ago and was terribly disappointed so we don't listen to it very often. Nice background music, very pleasant. Glad I bought it."
5,Have always loved Nat King Cole's unique voice,"Wonderful artist, timeless through the decades! Remember listening to him with my parents....he appealed to me then and still does."
5,puts me in a good mood,"This is a great collection of his hits. It makes you feel like you're walking in a romantic comedy starring Meg Ryan. Love it, love it!"
2,Records are better,"Although i'm far from an audiophile, more than half of the songs on this CD don't even sound like Nat King Cole! I had several of his record albums and they were much better. Overall, I'm very disappointed."
5,Just love this Album,Ever song that listen to brings me very fond memories. There is nothing like listening to the music that your mom and dad helped you grow up on
3,ehh,"i didn't like it that much. it was entertaining to read through, but the title itself seemed needlessly pessimistic (""survive"" as opposed to ""thrive"" or ""excel""). ultimately it served a purpose as entertaining, but i got my serious advice from other sources and older students."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I have never written a negative review for any book before, but this is one awful, unhelpful book, and it's not just me that thinks so. I bought it for my soon-to-be college freshman and she told her high school sister; ""Don't read that book, it's just stupid."""
5,Four murder stories from FBI Files Season I & II,"This package contains four stories about murderers and the FBI agents and police who captured them. Episodes / Cases include - Murdering Cowboy about serial killer Claude Dallas; Hunter's Game about serial killer Robert Hansen, Human Prey about serial killer Thomas Dillon & Death in Alaska about killer Kirby Anthony."
4,AWESOME,This is a great cd: 1 Part Hank Williams 1 Part Sebadoh III 1 Part Guitar Wolf Mix it all up and it rocks like nobodys business
4,great!,He is still one of the most relevant voices of my time. I wish the world still worked like that.
4,Star Wars Clone wars DVD review in my opinion,"It was the best DVD a star wars fan can ever buy and I was so excited to have the dvd box set of the entire season 1 of star wars the clone wars with all 22 episodes.However the only thing that was a little disappointing is that the dvd cover said that you'll also get the 22 commentary interviews and a sneak peak to star wars the clone wars season 2 but this was no where to be found in the dvd box set only the 22 episodes were included,so maybe next time when you guys are selling this product exempt the 22 interviews and sneak peak of season 2 from the box set unless if you are sure amazon that the product from the producer has all the details in the disk as shown from the product details, this will be better for other customers who are buying and not misleading.No need to apologize to me I accept that it was not your fault but Lucas' fault and DON'T GET THE WRONG IDEA I LOVE THE DVD BOX SET it's great."
5,Clone Wars is Star Wars,"Clone Wars Season 1 is great! Sure there are some cheesy parts with battle droids and Jar Jar Binks in some of the first few episodes, but after the team behind Clone Wars gets some episodes under their belt they really get good. The thing that makes me like Clone Wars so much is that it reminds me of the original 3 Star Wars movies. The special features make you understand why because the people making this actually care about making it feel like the originals. The special features are great and some of the episodes are extended cuts. There is even a booklet inside the case that showcases some of the artwork. The Clone Wars looks great in 1080p and the 5.1 sound is good too. Overall, the series is very well put together and is more enjoyable without the commercial breaks. It really lets you explore the characters, even more than episodes 1-3. Don't let the cartoon look turn you away. There is plenty of action and it really has something for everyone to like about it."
3,Impressive,"If I could, I would give this 3.5 stars, not just 3.Okay, some of the episodes are a bit kiddy, but hey, that's the business - right? However, many of the episodes are great in terms of story and art. Highly recommended for ANY Star Wars fan or for those weirdos who love to watch action-packed video game trailers.BTW, season two rocks a little harder, but still, that occasional ""kiddy"" stuff does rear it's head; however, never does it take away from the bigger scope of things."
5,Great addition to the Star Wars Universe,"I admit I was a little skeptical after seeing the Clone Wars movie on Pay Per View. However, after seeing Season 1 in its entirity I believe this is a great addition to the Star Wars Universe. The picture and sound on the Blu-Ray is incredible. The writing and voice acting is great. The colors, textures and modeling is extraordinary. I can't wait for season 2! I will be purchasing it on blu-ray certainly!"
5,Great!,I purchased this for my son! He loved it and it didn't look like it was repackaged! Great movies as well!
1,More Style over Substance,"Good lord this show looks and sounds absolutely amazing. Really Stunning. Unfortunately, the story doesn't make sense and the characters have no depth and aren't interesting. If you need a lightsaber cutting up some really annoying robot armies, then by all means proceed. But you have been warned."
2,pretty awful show,"The old animated clone wars is far better, this is just full of ridiculous and embarassingly bad droid humour. What a waste of time."
5,This is what the other seasons should base their dvd sets on!!!!!!,"I don't know why seasons 2 and 3 had to get cheap on us and leave out the behind the scenes commentaries for all 22 episodes. The first one is just a perfect match, great and beautiful animation and awesome story lines. Its unfortunate but overall the show is creating quite a buzz with star wars fans and will hopefully always be held in high regard after its finished!!!!"
4,better than the movie!!!!,a lot better than the animated movie. shipped quickly to an apo address overseas. im very glad i bought this item.
5,BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!!!!!!,I have been watching the tv show star wars the clone wars for about a year it is one of my favorite shows so i asked for it from my birthday. i had so much fun watching it. there is 22 episodes on it and 7 directors episodes wich was cool to see the extended scenes on the episodes.
3,Enjoyable movies.,"This is a good product for Blu- ray movies. My 11 year old son really likes the Clone Wars movies. I do however wish that the package included DVD's too. He mistakenly took it in the car on a long trip, and could not play the movies because we only have a Blu Ray player at home."
5,Very nice DVD season,My boyfriend loved this as a gift. He loves Star Wars and really enjoyed the animated series. It does not feel like a cartoon. The graphic quality is really good. I recommend this to all Star Wars fans.
5,My son loves it!,My son is a huge Star Wars fan. He loves this DVD! There are multiple episodes on multiple DVDs - a good buy.
5,My son loves it!,"Whats great about this is that if you are a Star Wars fan, you will enjoy it. Be it as a kid or adult. In some ways you can say that the Clone Wars series does better than the Episode 1-3 movies. The timeline is between episodes 2 and 3. The stories are engaging and have a theme to each one with a very slight story arch."
5,Something my boys can agree on - It's AWESOME!,"I bought this DVD set for my nine and ten year old boys. They are huge SW:TCW fans. They usually don't get along very well, but this is one thing they can agree on. They would watch it all night long if they could!"
3,Fun but disjointed,"The Clone Wars is fun to see but there is not real story to speak of. Sometimes there are three episodes in a row that can be stung together to make an longer plot point, but for the most part it dose not matter the order you view them. The worst is between ""The Hidden Enemy"" and ""Blue Shadow Virus"" (between disc 3 and 4). In it Aniken an Obi-one are stuck surrounded by droids then the next think you know they are the only to available Jedi to help on Naboo. (They are surrounded by Jedi).Coherence to the side this is still a fun adventure for any age."
2,It could have been so much better,"What a let down. After watching and totally enjoying the first Clone Wars cartoons, I was sadly disappointed when this was released. All of the characters appear carved from stone with their total lack of facial expression, and it is very distracting from the story If they had told the same story as a real cartoon, and not this cg garbage, it would have made a HUGE difference. Do your self a favor and skip these video game cut scenes and go buy the real Star Wars Clone Wars cartoons, still available used on Amazon.Star Wars - Clone Wars, Vol. 1Star Wars - Clone Wars, Vol. 2"
4,Fills in the Missing Bits?,"I'm only a casual fan of Star Wars (not into the books and graphic novels), so the Clone Wars TV series is perfect as it continues the story with familiar characters and fits comfortably between the blockbuster films. The animation is high quality and the choices for the character voices are spot on, evoking both the animated Clone Wars movie and the live-action films.I admit a little bit of the thrill is taken out when the realisation sets in that all the main characters are going to survive until Episode 3 ""The Revenge of the Sith"", where many of them won't even make an appearance or warrant a mention (Ventress? Ahsoka?).I find the characters a little 1-dimensional and the back story development nearly non-existent - but my 8-year-old loves everything about the Clone Wars, so they must be doing something right!"
4,Clone Wars,"Many things have been written about the problems with epI, epII, epIII. But if you really are a fan of Star Wars then you need to check this set out. It's got action and the animation is pretty cool. Clone Wars explains some things from Star Wars and overall is extremely faithful to the main story. Once you start watching, you'll want to keep on watching."
5,Fun to watch,My kids love it. Great image fidelity. I don't really care about DVD special features and so cannot comment on that.
5,Excellent retelling of the years between movie episodes,"I saw ""The Clone Wars"" movie on Blu-Ray and I enjoyed it. I then purchased this set also on Blu-Ray and I was hooked on the TV program. The mini documentaries for each episode are excellent and entertaining. I love having multiple audio tracks in alternate languages with their corresponding subtitles. I love the scene from episode 1 where Yoda teaches the clones about their individuality. I watched that scene five times in all the languages! It is a beautiful scene reminiscent of the ""Empire Strikes Back"". I love having two Spanish audio tracks; the original Castellano is SO COOL!!"
5,star wars the clone wars,I got this as a gift and they absolutely loved it!!!! :DIt was awesome and I would recommend it to anyone looking to buy!!
3,"5 stars for series, -2 stars for a higher priced downgrade in packaging","So, the original releases of Clone Wars Seasons 1 & 2 came in nice DigiBook packaging which included concept art in a book inside the hard cover book that held the 3 discs. Something that made these releases unique. So now, Season 3 comes out in a standard 3-disc Blu-ray case, so in order to prepare for this change in packaging, WB re-releases the first two seasons in standard cases as well apparently back in September about a month before Season 3 comes out. But here's the kicker. The digibooks ran around $40 new on or around release day, and now the prices on these re-releases are over $50. What's up with that? Downgrade in packaging and you jack up the price? These should be discount releases. $20-25 max. The only justification for the increase in price would be if these include DTS-MA HD sound over the original 640 Kbps DD tracks. But that's stretching it. Anybody got any actual specs for these?"
5,Star Wars gets even better,"At first I thought a cartoon version of Star Wars could never be good, until I was bored and bought The Clone Wars movie. Absolutely awesome. The stories are unbelievable. While the series seems to be geared toward children, it is great for adults as well. I actually couldn't wait for the first season to come out on DVD and bought it on iTunes. I even think the campy droid humor is awesome. And yes, beings are killed in some episodes. They couldn't have picked a better way to bridge the gap between episode II and episode III. I have seen all the movies multiple times, read all the 110+ books and even the comic books and I say this does Star Wars Justice. A must get for any Star Wars fan."
2,You sould tell all the pokemon`s real attacks.,I READ ALL THE POKEMONS ATTACKS AND FOUND SOME ATTACKS ARE MADE UP! SO FOR THE NEXT TRANSLATION BOOK HAVE THE RIGHT ATTACKS.
2,Sorry Horwood!! It is a mistake to follow genius.,"Reading ""The Willows In Winter"" is a chilling experience after reading Grahame's classic, ""The Wind In The Willows."" Comparing the first chapter in each book is impossible! Grahame wrote a work of art in literary prose, while Horwood's attempt at a sequel cannot even capture the character of Mole correctly. How sad. If you thoroughly respect Grahame's Wild Wood, do not buy or read this attempt to capitalize upon another author's genius."
1,Absolutely horrible - no I mean painful,"First let me say I love the Wind in the Willows and really looked forward to reading this sequel. But it is difficult for me to express in words how Horwood utterly fails to capture the characters and just creates an absolutely painful experience. The original was a masterpiece and the characters - even toad- were gentle, loving creatures, with transcendent subtle nature. These characters are somehow mean, shallow, and just plain awful. Reading it (and I promise you I longed to do so and meet them again) just so ruins these characters that it made me cringe page after page. Why did he do this? Did the positive reviewers fail to see the night and day difference between this and the original. Garbage just garbage."
1,Horwood utterly fails to capture the spirit!,"With The Willows in Winter, Horwood creates a dreary mimic of Grahame's beautiful world, failing miserably to recapture the wonder of the River, or the dread of the Wild Wood. The characters are pathetically portrayed and I cannot believe the writer of such stunning classics as Duncton Wood and its sister novels could ever fall so undeniably FLAT!"
1,not my thing...,"Fine for a 12 year old! One member of our book club wanted to read this, so we all did. To be fair, I didn't care for this sort of thing when I actually was 12, so was pretty hopeless. If you have a bright 8 year old, would probably work just fine!"
3,"Yes, helpful",This little booklet helped me assure myself that my dog does not have separation anxiety. I did use the suggestions about giving her a Kong to slurp and lick peanut butter from when I leave and to be casual about leaving her instead of having a complicated routine.
4,Anxiety or a training problem?,"This book was very helpful in determining if your dog has actual separation anxiety or if the problem is more of a training issue. It's not as black and white as I would have liked, but neither are pet problems all the time.Gives ideas and step-by-step plan of how to deal with either problem. Recommended to figure things out either way!"
2,Nice ideas,"The ideas in this book are nice and have been discussed in training programs and other books, but they just don't work. I don't know if my dog is just a horrible case but it's been months and there is no improvement. My dog won't chew on anything I give him as a distraction. If he even hears the door, forget it, he's howling. I live in an apartment and I really need something that works. I've practiced desensitization techniques when it comes to my leaving routine, leaving for short periods of time and then increasing it, leaving a sock that smells like me with him, giving him a stuffed Kong to keep him busy, a citronella collar, a comfort diffuser with dap, and just about everything else and he is still a nightmare when left alone. I guess if your dog's anxiety isn't too bad this might work."
4,short but to the point,"i was a bit surprised that it was really more like a pamphlet than a book, but actually, it was quite helpful.. i will challenge anyone out there to the separation anxiety problem they have with their pet as compared to mine. the crazy viszla that wants to attach to me permanently. i have him on prozac (doggie style) and it is necessary to use behavior mod in addition. this pamphlet helps identify what else you have to do, rather succinctly. if you are as desperate as i am, you will really appreciate any and all info. don't want to have to give up the dog..."
2,Rip off,"For $11, I thought I was getting a BOOK. This was a big pamplet, maybe more like a booklet. Not worth $11. I have another McConnell booklet and one that's an actual book, and I will read them because her info is good. But not worth $11. Please don't gouge me again - I cannot afford it."
4,Good quick read,This book is brief and small but I liked that because it contained a lot of good information and gave me some great pointers to do right away. If you want more than this you'd probably need to hire a dog trainer or behaviorist to help you anyway.
4,Separation anxiety counter conditioning,"I bought this little booklet because I have had a dog in the past who had problems with separation anxiety, so I already know I don't know what to do to help such a dog. Also, the breed I am considering for my next dog has a high need for companionship, and I wanted to know how to forestall any behaviour (on my part or the dog's) that would result in separation anxiety. The author defines what separation anxiety is (and is not) and explains how it can develop. She then gives examples and exercises that will help you and your dog, inch by slow inch, learn a different behaviour and become sound of mind again. It's a short book that doesn't sugar coat the seriousness of the problem or the work and time involved in solving it, but it is also sprinkled throughout with good humor and clear evidence that the author loves dogs and wants to help them lead happy lives."
5,Best book out there for separation anxiety,"We adopted our rescued puggle nearly four years ago, and when he came to us he had a severe case of separation anxiety. I did tons of research on how to help him - materials from our vet, other books - but it was this little book that gave the most thorough, effective and sensible approach to overcoming the problem - and IT WORKED :-)! McConnell doesn't downplay the hard work it takes to get your dog past this difficult problem, but she also tells you that once it's solved, it's solved forever - and this has proven to be absolutely true. We thank you so much, Ms. McConnell, and so does our dog Hank!"
4,pretty good,Overall this is a good refrence book to keep handy as review incase you forget something. Most of the things in here we had heard before
3,Short booklet on helping determine separation anxiety with some useful tips,"This book was slightly helpful with our separation anxiety husky. It did help us notice he did definitely have it (we pretty much knew it was genuine prior to getting this booklet).The booklet is very easy to read and understand, but it didn't solve the issue. It did help with some *ideas, but desensitizing doesn't work...offering a stuffed kong (puzzle toy, etc..) doesn't work...cage/crate ha-ha not acceptable for our situation...we tried each of the suggestion for leaving him alone & no success.*Our best solution has been A- the huskies come with (whenever feasable) B- when they can't, we have a babysitter (family or close friend) stay with them. They are never left without a human (that they connect with).Otherwise, our huskies (including the one with separation anxiety) are well trained, well mannered and very good all around."
3,You can't win em all.,"A little disapointing considering the actors. Fun to watch, but I wouldn't reccomend anyone buyiung it. At least it didn't cost much."
3,Light comedy,"A nice, light comedy from the 40's. It is dated and if you don't have any knowledge of life then, you may not connect. It's nothing really special except fairly good acting by a fine cast with only a fair script.The film doesn't do much for the status of women in that the intellectual heroine is portrayed as a ""know-it-all"" and becomes all-a-twitter for a flyboy (John Wayne). You can find better performances of all the actors elsewhere but this movie can occupy some time."
4,Romantic Comedy,"John Wayne plays a Marine on leave, Claudette Colbert plays an arthor looking for a real he-man to play the hero she created in a movie, and of course they fall in love with each other. This being a Hollywood romantic comedy, there are a lot of bumps in the road before they can get together for a lifetime of happiness. This is a good, enjoyable comedy-recommended."
3,Too long,This book needed to be edited. It is much too long. A lot of boring and unecessary details that could have easily been edited out and still have kept the book entertaining. I too did not like the southern cliche's. The simpleness of Charlene and her brother were a little more than I could stomache....these characters were downright stupid. But...it did have it's good parts...just too many boring ones. I enjoyed First Wives Club and The Bestseller much more than this one.
5,This is one book I don't loan (I'm afraid I won't get it bac,"I have read Flavor of the Month recently for the second time. Both times were in the summer when I needed something that I didn't have to think about, that was exciting, This book fit the bill. It is large, but I flew through the pages and was dissapointed when it was over. I pride myself on being able to figure out hidden meanings and pick up on endings, but this book totally surprised me! I am usually a literary snob who sticks to the classics and was a bit ashamed to be reading this one, but it really kept me interested and entertained. What is wrong with that?"
5,Best Sleazy Beach Book I've Ever Read!,"I read this book a couple of years ago on a Florida vacation, and I still remember the details (which is amazing,considering how many books I read). It has everything you could want in a beach book: sex, shopping, scandal & sleaze. I've been searching for a book this entertaining ever since I read it!"
3,Pretty good but not her best.,"I liked the character Mary Jane but wasn't crazy about some of the others (Lila Kyle and especially her mother, Charlene and her brother and don't even get me started on Candy and Skinny). Parts of this one were a little too far out there for me. Still like all of Ms. Goldsmiths books I couldn't put it down and ended up reading it more than once."
1,Remember the cliche-'trees died to make this book'? Waste!,"Paper-thin characters, implausible plot, way too long. The writer includes a pet peeve of mine; she pretends to show outrage over violence against and physical exploitation of women while offering drooly examples of violence against and physical exploitation of women. Just an example of how carelessly this book is written; the book is set in the 1990's and one of the major characters, Lila, is around 18. However, Lila's mother was a star in 1948."
3,The book drags on but the end is a kick,"My mom gave me this book and the only reason I kept reading through this slooooow plot is she said it had a terrific ending. So I plowed through it, and I'm glad I did."
5,This book was so long................,"and I wish it was even longer. This is my all-time favorite Olivia Goldsmith. Her characters are so much fun to read about. This book is more like watching a movie than reading a book. It should be made into a movie. Miss Goldsmith, please write a sequel."
2,I disliked the characters so much I quit reading it,Not since Gone With The Wind have I so wanted to reach into the pages of a book and slap the whiny women in it.I had great hopes for a fun read with industry insider plot but was disappointed.
3,"Good fun, but come on . . .","What I liked about this book is that it's every bit as dishy as Jackie Collins, but in a totally fictional way. Think about it. Jack and Jill and Compromise = Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune, which makes Mary Jane = Kathy Bates, and Sam becomes a heterosexualized Terrence McNally, with Crystal Plenum as a dumbed-down Michelle Pfeiffer. I'm laughing hysterically just at that. What was even funnier was that Olivia didn't sue Carrie Fisher for lifting most of her salient plot points and cramming them into a very similarly themed teleplay, These Old Broads.On the whole a better read than the novel it was ""spun off"" from (you did catch Phoebe van Gelder and Brenda's brother in there, didn't you), The First Wives Club, as Goldsmith has developed a better ear for dialogue (or at least taken on a set of plots where stilted dialogue seems more in place)."
4,the intellectual's jackie collins,"olivia goldsmith is a higher brow talent than jackie collins. so with this assault on the hollywood star making system, you may think of hollywood wives, but this is a more indepth look at the hollywood insider's system.true the cliches are overripe: southerners, agents, and actresses do not get off easily, but it's easy to watch goldsmith ridcule them and you don't necessarily feel too badly about their troubles.the ending's way over the top also, but it kinda all feels like a good 80's primetime soap opera a la dynasty.a long but fun read like most of goldsmith's novels."
5,wonderful guilty pleasure,"For lovers of _The Bestseller_, you will also love _Flavor of the Month_. A delightfully witty, clever, creative romp through the lives of three women who stumble into great luck in Hollywood, and all the people who try to make money off them. I read this book on vacation after reading _Valley of the Dolls_, and I must say that I much preferred it. In fact, I could barely put it down. I have since sent it to all of my friends in the entertainment business. Even though it is about 10 years' old, it still feels very current (with the exception of one plot twist which is far less shocking these days than it was even 10 years ago). A great book."
4,Trashy but fun,"I know what you may be saying...you never read these type of books. Treat yourself to a guilty pleasure.Flavor of the Month deals with this simple idea, we live in an age where beauty can be bought, and if bought does it really make a difference. The book was engaging I flew through it in about two days. Since reading it, I've loaned it out to friends who remove the cover jacket so as not to be seen reading it, but pretty soon their recommending it themselves."
3,Doesn't fit Audio Technica AT2020 USB,This mount doesn't fit the Audio Technica AT2020 condenser mic even though Amazon presents them together. The threaded collar bottoms out against the mic and doesn't pull the mic in tight. The result is a loose fit that rattles - defeating the purpose of the shock mount. There's no flaw in either product; they're just not meant for each other.
4,Works with AT2020 with minor adjustment,"I just received this and the AT2020 mic. The threading on the mic fits perfectly into the SP01; however, the threading on the mic isn't long enough to get a snug fit onto the SP01. There was still a small gap which allowed the mic to wobble very slightly while in the mount. The easiest solution for me was to use a fabric washer...the kind you use for a car battery. I just put this in between the At2020 and the SP01 and the problem was solved. Very snug fit once I installed the washer."
5,It really works for MXL V67g,"Hi, I bought this shockmount based on the review of ""sanjipeppe. ""I have a MXL condenser microphone v67g.I did what he explains, Mr. sanjipeppe.I removed the original nut Samson SP01 shockmount and use the MXL Microphone v67g, great, fits very well.This shows very robust shockmount and is adjusted to many positions of use.I recommend it to everyone.Greetings., Ali.Hola, yo compre este shockmount basado en la revision de ""sanjipeppe"".Yo tengo un microfono de condensador MXL v67g.Yo hice lo que èl explicò, Mr. sanjipeppe.Yo eliminè la tuerca original del shockmount Samson SP01 y utilicè la del microfono MXL v67g, grandioso, se adaptò muy bien.Esta shockmount se nota muy robusta y se ajusta a muchas posiciones de uso.Lo recomiendo a todos.Saludos., Ali."
3,BE WARE!! ONLY FITS SAMSON CONDENSER MIC!,"This looks like a really good Shockmount, and I was really happy to find it... until i tried to put it all together and realized that it didn't fit my mic... apparently it said somewhere that it only fit a specific Samson condenser mic, but I never read that!!! So, bummer for me... looks really good though, so if you do have a Samson mic, give it a try... good thing was that my mic came with its own mount, so phew!"
5,I can smack my desk and type with no vibrations,"I was hesitant in buying this shockmount because I didn't think it was that necessary. But the price was too tempting. I'm very glad I bought it because I didn't realize how much I shake the desk when I'm typing and just resting my arms. I have a relatively sturdy desk but I can still get vibrations in the recording if I don't attach my mic to the shockmount.I use this in conjunction with the following products to make a killer home recording studio. And I bought it all on Amazon for a great price.On Stage DS7200B Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand, BlackNady MPF-6 6-Inch Clamp On Microphone Pop FilterAudio Technica AT2020USB Studio Condenser MicrophoneIf you found this information helpful, please read my other reviews and let me know if they helped!"
4,Doesn't Fit Nady SCM-800,"This mic isn't advertised for the Nady SCM-800 (an older condenser mic I bought in '05), but I took a chance after reading so many positive reviews on here for other mics. It doesn't, after all, fit the Nady. Still, it is a quality mount with potential for other mics. For my purposes, I can stand the mic on end and the cord weighs it down enough to hold it *fairly* steadily in place (it's not in danger of falling over). But from any other angle, the mount simply would not hold the mic. In fact, it could damage your mic if you use it in any other position. Bear in mind, this is NOT a design flaw of the Samson -- it's a great product. I just wanted any potential buyers to know. I would rate it a strong 4 1/2 stars if I could."
4,It Does What Just What It's Supposed To,"The Samson SP01 Shockmount Spider Mount for Condenser Microphones works quite well with the Samson CO1 and CO1U condenser microphones. It probably works equally well with any condenser microphone that has the same form factor as the CO1 and CO1U.The spider mount looks professional and cuts down significantly on vibrations. The locking mechanism could be somewhat better as it doesn't tighten quite enough, but unless you yank on it it does the job as well."
5,Works Great,This shock mount is perfect! I use it with an AT2020 which fits perfectly and provides good support. I would highly recommend this product
4,Does NOT Fit the MXL 990 Microphone,"I bought this based on one of the reviewer's comment that it fits the MXL 990 microphone. It DOES NOT! Now, I have to take the trouble of returning it and paying shipping to return. Just goes to show you can't always trust the reviews. As for the product itself, it is a good quality product and I would have rated it 5 stars and recommend it if it fits your microphone. Too bad it doesn't fit mine as I would have loved to keep it."
5,Very nice quality mount!,"I been using these for years and they are strong made of quality materials, great looking, having this razzmatazz character mounts! The clams are stronf and realible and keep mike in a right position. The screw mount allows easily fix them up on the correct angle and use mike up or down!All this said I assume you realize this is Samson's quality unit for Samson's mikes like C01 to C08 (at a moment of writing) or their equally terrific ribbon mic."
3,fit?,"im just wondering does this fitMusician's Gear Tripod Mic Stand with Telescoping Boom, Blackbecause this condenser came in today and i couldnt figure out if i was doing something wrong with the stand i have or what."
3,"Uuugggh, same old story...","Things seems to work fine, but like many other things that I've purchased via Amazon, the packaging was poor and showed wear. How do I bloody know whether what I""m purchasing is new if it's not shrink-wrapped? Seems like sellers really cut corners because one can't see the product (packaging, etc.) before purchasing it.- Disgruntled Customer"
1,Does not fit Yeti condenser mic,"I saw the title ""Samson SP01 Shockmount Spider Mount for Condenser Mics"" and bought it, my mistake. It doesn't fit any condenser mic, just Samson mics looks like. Looks a good product, but it's not for my mic."
4,"Fine, but it obstructs the pop filter","I got this along with an Audio Technica AT 2020 microphone. It fits fine, except that it extends so far over the mike that I can't get the pop filter close to the mike (for that extra bass effect). This is better for a polar (end-on) pattern than a side-address mike."
4,Good quality shock mount,"Does a very good job in isolating the mic from its surrounding environment. The threads are quite rough and of questionable quality, you have to position things just right or else it binds up when attempting to screw the mic down. Likewise, the threads to attach it to the boom are also rather sloppy, but it does hold firm once screwed down. The rest of the build quality seems fine. It stays locked in the position you put it and the shock cords have held up well in the time that I've had it. At the end of the day, it is an inexpensive shock mount that works fine."
4,Pretty good shock mount,"Although it was not made for it, I bought the SP01 shockmount to go with my Audio-Technica AT2020 microphone.The screw-on base part threads are the correct ones for this mike - but the mike does not ""snug"" up to fit tight.So I went down to the local Ace Hardware store and bought a rubber o-ring that worked perfectly as a ""spacer"" of sorts.With the o-ring, the SP01 fits the AT2020 perfectly."
2,Doesn't work for AKG mics,Bought this for my AKG Perception 220 mic ... doesn't have the right thread. Aside from that it looks pretty good.
4,Good product for semi-pro audio recording,"The Samson shockmount is a decent product for keeping vibrations away from your condenser or dynamic microphone. It's a must for professional or high-end amateur recording if you're using the Samson C01, C03 or QU1 mics. It's a bit heavy and awkward to attach to some mic stands, though. This is relatively new, so we'll see how well the rubber bands hold up."
2,It don't fit,This shock mount doesn't fit my V67G consendensor mic. Maybe they forgot to pack a suitable adapter ring. I'll have to take it down to the workshop and have it modded.
2,White Noise,"Added the shockmount and instantly started getting white noise. Didn't even think to attribute it to the shockmount so I was checking all my settings/etc... doing the whole routine. Took off the shockmount to have the white noise stop immediately.Not sure if I am the only one who has experienced this... perhaps it's just a fluke, but sucks on my end. Wasn't expecting a shockmount to create noise.Bummed."
2,"It's a great shock absorber, with a few problems.","This item is a great, universal shock absorber that mounts on my mic stand without any problems. For the price, the build quality is pretty good, but not great.I have a mic that has a shallower threaded lock ring that does not fit the SP01. The SP01's lock ring threads do not extend far enough to engage the threads on the mic. It's a real issue, as my mic is not a cheap one, and the threads on it are standard. The SP01 should work with it. And I see no way to upgrade."
3,Croc Rock,"The part of this score that I noticed most was the main theme, played in the opening and closing tracks. Thats the outback-style guitar, drum, and digeridoo theme. It is a catchy theme that works well in the movie and it will stick in your head once you've heard it on CD. That theme is the most enjoyable, memorable part of the score. Other tracks to be noticed are Track 3 which is a pleasant, bouncy guitar tune. The rest of the score is mainly pop, 1980's kind of sounds, but it does work great for the movie and sounds okay on CD. It can get a little annoying but the other music I think makes up for it. Another Paul Hogan movie score to look out for by Australian composer Bruce Rowland is ""Lightning Jack"" which also contains some catchy tunes. Maybe Peter Best will be back to score ""Crocodile"" Dundee 3, which is currently filming in here in Australia."
5,A soothing night-time ritual,"I got this CD prior to the birth of my son, now 16-months old. Since his birth, we've listened to this CD every night at bedtime. You'd think after 16 months I'd be sick of it by now, but I'm not! The songs are all very soothing for a baby's (and mommy's) ears, and the flow of the tracks moves along nicely. We've tried other CD's for our bedtime ritual, but keep coming back to this one. As other reviews have noted, Wilson does have a ""baby whisperer"" voice, and the song selections are a nice mix of classic tunes, covers of more modern music, and original compositions. I wish she'd make another lullaby album, I'd buy it in a heartbeat!Update Jan. 2010: We still listen to this all the time. Not every night, but quite frequently. So glad to see it's available again on Amazon, so that more people can discover this wonderful little lullaby album."
4,I like it!,"I bought this primarily because I'm a huge Brian Wilson fan and I wanted to hear him and Carnie sing together. They do a great job on ""You Are So Beautiful"", the song that Dennis Wilson used to sing at Beach Boys concerts. Brian sounds as good here as he has anywhere recently, which is saying a lot. His vocals since 2004's release of ""SMiLE"" have been excellent.Lots of the Wilson clan perform on this CD:Justyn Wilson sings on his father Carl's ""Heaven""Wendy Wilson sings on ""With The Sun""Daria and Delanie Wilson sing on ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star""Marilyn Wilson (The Honeys) sings on Dennis' ""Forever""At first listen I enjoyed the classic songs like ""Over The Rainbow"" and ""Wonderful World"" the most, but the original songs are quickly growing on me. Carnie's voice is soft and soothing with a Karen Carpenter quality to it.I'm giving a copy to my grandchildren. Meanwhile, it's a relaxing and pleasant listen."
4,TRULY A GIFT,"Simply put, this is a beautiful CD. Makes you want to lay down and relax.Great job Carnie! Look forward to hearing more of your work. Another Wilson Phillips CD would be fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,headache band,"Being a migraine sufferer, I was really anticipating trying this item BUT the product has an EXTREMELY strong perfume/soap ODOR that is from being on a shelf next to strong smelling items or possibly being packaged w/ them. Therefore,once I have a headache, it is not possible for me to even try the product because strong perfume smells ALWAYS make migraines much worse. So, I am extremly disappointed that I can't give it a fair shot. I used to work in a natural foods store so I am very familiar w/ this smell. A lot of the natural soaps have a very potent smell. I'd like to try one right off the production line!"
2,It's truly a clicker - LOUD!,I wanted to like this remote and it does do everything that it says it does. But it is so loud - the clicker can be heard and is picked up by the microphone. This is a product that I wish I could have handled in store to check. I'm going to keep it as a backup but it will not be my primary one.
5,Excellent product,Exellent product.Easy setup and easy to use . Arrived well packaged.This product has really enhanced my presentations. Will always recommend .
1,Forget 100 ft. It does about 30 feet.,I could not get this to connect from my front room to my study (up one flight) which has a 40 ft direct line to the tv. It is said to be radio frequency but it needs to be pointed at the computer to attain 30 ft. I returned it. Thanks Amazon.
4,Good pointer,"I have enjoyed using the clicker so far, and have been impressed with its features. However, I did notice a little lag time from when I started my power point slide to when the buttons on the clicker started working. This may just be user error on my end. Great product over all, and I would recommend it to anyone so far."
1,It does not last,"This device is great when it works. The green light is a bit dim but that is OK. However, the device started to malfunction only after half a semester. First, the prev button acted as next and the next stopped working. Then the receiver was off completely. I thought I could just use it as a pointer. Surely. My only trouble is how to turn it off. I examined the electronics. It is probably due to cheap and crapy pushbuttons and circuit. Recommendation: buy a red laser remote from Logitech. The light is dim red. But it last for years."
1,HATE IT!,"Pro:1. noneCons:1. it says it works on Mac, but doesnt seem like it2. keys r hard to maneuver. unlike the logitech ppt remote, which has indentation that sort of guides ur finger, this one doesnt. the indentation feature on the logitech remote allows u maneuver the remote without looking at it & u can focus ur attention on the ppt.overall really disappointed since it has received phenomenal reviews."
3,average,"You can probably find a better presenter for the price. It looks very slick, but takes a while to start and the range is fairly limited."
2,SP400 FEEDBACK,"Initially, I really liked this presenter remote. I was using it during an all day presentation. The buttons stuck during the latter part of the day..causing me to have to use the laptop to advance my slide. Maybe I just had a defective unit....up until then I was really impressed. I returned it for a refund....have not heard back from them yet...I would like to try another one....the verdict is still out!"
1,inconsistent,"For a little while this pointer worked fine for me. It lasted through two semesters teaching one class per semester. However, once I started full-time (this past year), it was so inconsistent that I finally just had to stop using it to avoid constantly interrupting my classes. One press of the button would either skip through 2-3 slides at a time, or the delay would be so great that I'd push the button again and after several seconds it'd follow orders. Other days it just wouldn't work at all. I was literally standing 15 feet away from my laptop whenever this happened. After a frustrating semester with this presenter I finally broke down and bought a Kensington, which is what my professors in graduate school always used."
4,Smart Pointer Review,"This rf remote is great to use as a presenter tool. It's a little twitchy as a remote mouse, a bit jumpy."
4,Point and Present,"I was searching for a wireless presenter for months and months. I don't want to say that I settled for this one, but I was up against a deadline and needed one quickly. this one had the highest rated reviews so I chose it. I really wanted one that had the mouse functionality with it as well. I was looking for one with a rubbery knob that would control the mouse. I still haven't found one of those.I have really enjoyed using this device. It has helped me appear more professional in my presentations. I can easily switch back and forth from presenter to mouse. It is very comfortable in my hand and lightweight. I would recommend this device to anyone looking for a wireless presenter."
5,Thumbs Up From Teacher Using Interactive Whiteboard!,"I'm a middle school teacher who uses lots of presentations to engage my students. This remote has given me mobility and the kids are intrigued by it! It was so easy to begin using, plug & play and has a fantastic range that more than suits my needs. I even walked down the hallway to another teachers door to test it out--even through one foot thick concrete walls it worked like a champ!"
2,Not reliable,"I used to own an older remote and I bought this one because of its many features. I returned to my old unit. This remote is extremely unreliable. When you plug it into the USB, it takes a while for the remote to activate; it stops working at random; some features are very difficult to program; it is extremely unreliable for class presentations. Sorry to give this negative review, in spite of the fact that its features look promising."
4,Good bang for the buck,"Use this item regularly for powerpoint presentations and only complaint is sometime it seems to get stuck. When this happens I have to pul lthe batteries and restart it. Distance is good as I am maybe 75' from my laptop that is on a balcony. Tried once to use it as a mouse to control the laptop pointer, but that proved very difficult. Overall it meets my needs at a fair price"
4,"Great device, but it does skip slides every once and a while","I used this device daily in my science classrooms and I cant tell you how much time it saves me while teaching. I am able to put practice problems in power point then walk around the classroom and check how students are doing. When I see that most of them get it right or wrong, I can click through each step explaining the process while pointing it out on students paper. I love this device because of the one on one time I get with my students throughout my lectures.My only problem is that it does skip slides every once in a while, which is not a problem in my classroom because I can just go back. The cost of the device for what I need it for is a perfect match."
3,Good product with one major flaw,Love the look and function of this product with one significant exception. Mouse functionality is great. Slide navigation is great. Setup is easy. The laser pointer is only bright enough to project from inside of 5 feet and the spot is too small to be seen from more than 15 feet.
2,Didn't Work as Expected,Purchased this item on high reviews. We tried it in our auditorioum. Needed to work for 70'-75' from the computer. Advertised to work to 100'. Wouldn't work consistantly to past 20' from computer. Worked very sporadically at distances past 20' and often double clicked through slides on powerpoint presentation. Would loved to have had it work but it didn't. Returned it to get a Targus model that we've tested and works fine.
4,Very Good,Everything is great about this product except the fact that using mouse and keyboard at the same time is not possible.. you need to use a switch (like on/off) switch to go to each mode.
3,"Not too bad, but had to return.","The buttons were a tad stiff and so was the pointer, almost robotic in its movement across the screen. Decent little machine, though I had to return it and find another that suits my purpose. I thought it was going to act pretty much like a mouse does, but it didn't really. Does anyone know a pointer that has some sort of trackball to make the cursor movement on the screen a little less stiff? If anyone knows of any, I would appreciate the advise. Thanks."
2,Too sensitive and no on/off button,"I found the device too sensitive and was always clicking forward more slides than I wanted. Also, I do not see an on/off switch which means I have to always take a battery out after use. I recently used a logitech at a clients boardroom and am switching to that."
2,Batteries drain when in case,"It works well, but if you put it in the carrying case, the battery drains because the buttons get pressed. There is no master power switch."
3,good pointer,Just needs a track and ball they mouse movement is not as functional as I need it. It slows down the presentation
1,Worked for About Three Months,"And then I couldn't get it to work again. I'm hoping to return it to the manufacturer for a replacement within the one year limited warranty because maybe I got a DUD. But I need this clicker to function as I am a professor who presents lessons every day. This is the third clicker I've tried, but to no avail. The batteries seem fine - the laser pointer works, but there is no signal to change the PowerPoint slides. Very frustrating!!$35 I think should get a clicker that would last at least two years, not 3 months. I've had it nearly 6 and hoping to get a replacement."
2,Laser pointer is too weak to be useful!,"The slide changer works fine but the laser pointer is too weak to be useful! So, now I use the presenter AND a separate laser pointer."
1,Good when it works,"This remote was great and did everything I needed for a good price, but it only lasted for about half of my semester. The computer recognizes the USB, but the remote no longer will connect. The laser still works though. Very disappointed."
5,As a school teacher I love it....,"I use this in the class room to run the over head. It works great, allowing me to roam free around the room to check on the students."
4,Great,"Product is easy to use and I chose the color so I would find it when placed anywhere in the classroom. Very small to conceal, but not too small where you cannot work the buttons. Once you get used to switching from presentation to mouse it is fun and easy to use. Great product and would highly recommend it."
2,Warning if planning to use with MacBook Air,"Anyone planning to use this with MacBook Air (the new 13"" one) should know that the receiver unit is wide and blocks the adjacent port. if you use it on the left side, you can't connect the power and if you use it on the right side, you can't connect the display. That problem plus the fact that the instructions contain no information about how to connect to a Mac make this an expensive laser pointer. Uh-oh."
4,"Works as advertised, running on Windows 7","Great pointer with a great cost point. I am running Windows 7 Home Premium (official release), and I just plugged in the dongle and it works great. I haven't had the chance to test it extensively, but what it does, it does well."
4,Not bad,"I've used this for teaching with Windows XP machines for a few years. It feels flimsy, but I guess it's also lightweight. The click is a bit too loud for my taste and sometimes I have to hit it a few times before it registers. I've held more comfortable pointers but the ergonomics aren't bad on this one. The laser is alright. I make sure to take the batteries out when I am not using it, and I don't think I've had to replace them yet.All in all, it's not mind-blowingly amazing, but it's not bad and the price was a bit cheaper than many other models when I picked it up a few years ago. There may be better options out there now, but I'll stick with this one until it breaks."
2,looks good...doesn't work good tho,"my unit has only worked 40% of the time. I plug it in and hit the forward button and sometimes it works, other times i have to advance slides manually and only use the laser pointer function. i would not recommend this unit."
3,Not so much Mac friendly,"According to previous reviews this item was very easy to use on Mac computers, which was the main reason I got it. Indeed it does work on my old iBook G4, but it doesn't recognize the device right away as offered it takes a little work. the mouse feature, is not really very practical for me. I didn't find any use for it.nice bright red finish, easy to find, comes with a nice little case for it."
5,Powerpoint Smart Pointer,"This is a light weight, easy to use device. I used it with my ASUS netbook and it worked great. I highly recommend it."
5,Terrific Presenter/Pointer!,Great product - simple to install and use. I teach at a university and use PowerPoint several times each week - this is indispensable! It even comes with its own zippered black case with room to carry extra batteries. Great value!
5,One of my best purchases,"I cannot believe how much I love this. I am a school teacher and used it to show a PowerPoint presentation, so I could walk around the room. It worked fantastic, the laser pointer helped me to emphasize areas of each slide. It is highly sensitive to touch and had to back track, but wasn't a big deal to me. The range is phenomenal. I tried it out from one corner of my house to another & it still worked. LOVE it."
3,"Fine as presentation remote, ""mouse function"" nonsensical","Pros: The presentation function is fine. The laser pointer is fine.Cons: The USB receiver cannot be stored in the body and is large--the size of a regular USB memory stick (but without any memory).The so-called ""mouse function"" works by pressing one button to go up, another to go down, and a third & fourth to move laterally--not a mouse function at all, more of a joystick. Nonsensical and misleading to claim this has a ""mouse function"", in my opinion.Previously I owned the Kensington SlimBlade presenter mouse, and that was an actual, functioning mouse AND a presentation remote. If you want the mouse and presentation remote functionality combined, I'd recommend that a thousand times over, despite its higher price point."
4,lots of sound for something so tiny,Great lil speaker the only downfall is the battery life and you cant keep it plugged in to charge while using it and the cord for the charger is kind of short overall though the product itself is great i would suggest it over others i researched......
2,For product I am looking for,To scroll pg. down instred of switch moving need schrolling whell or ball. So we can excess web faster but all other feature is ok.
3,Button malfunctioned after two years.,I used the SP400 Smart-Pointer for about two and a half years in teaching courses. The button for advancing a slide became somewhat collapsed and usually advanced a couple of slides instead of one.Also I never found the mouse function very useful because one can only move vertically or horizontally. This is too slow and awkward for most presentation situations.
4,"Satechi SP400 Smart-Pointer 2,4 GHz RF.",Enkel bruke. Fin design. Jeg vil anbefale den til mine venner og andre som er interessert i et slikt produkt.
1,"Can't truly give a review on the product, because I received a lemon","The shape & portability of this item seems reasonable, but I was upset having received a device that worked for only 1-2 days. Never worked since then. Changing batteries does diddly squat. Bought it from (what I thought was) a reputable seller...maybe I just received an unlucky item."
1,Connection is inconsistent,This remote is quirky and doesn't always work. I often have to walk over to my desk and use the mouse which defeats the purpose of being mobile in the classroom while teaching. Too bad the buttons on my old one quit working as I never had any problems with it. The old one was a Targus brand...which I will be buying again since this one is a piece of junk.
5,Fabulous,"Use for work for Powerpoint. It works great, setup is easy, it even has a hard drive on it for saving your presentation as an emergency. Simple to use and the design is great, can walk 50 feet away and not even point to the computer and it works, a must have."
1,Doesn't work with my Mac at all,"I bought this to use with a Mac and shouldn't have bothered. When the USB is inserted, it proclaims that it doesn't recognize the keyboard and you have to jump a couple of hoops to get past that. Once you fuss with that and try to start the presentation, it knocks Powerpoint out of slideshow mode and back into slide view - and then won't do anything else. The pointer works fine, and the mouse is controllable as long as you don't mind it being really slooooooooow - but otherwise this is a worthless piece of crap. Save your money."
2,Does NOT reach even 50 ft.!,"This pointer would be fine for in-class use if you are a teacher; however, if you are wanting to use it in a large room, go with a Targus. I purchased this remote specifically because it said it had a 100 ft. range. It does NOT. Once you exceed about 30 feet it begins to behave erratically, not moving when you push the button, then skipping through 2-3 slides the next time you press it. I have now had to spend more money to purchase a Targus. My personal Targus remote advertises that it has a 30 ft. range, but works perfectly in our 50 ft. room. If you want reliability, do not purchase this remote!!"
2,It's Not at Home on the Range,This remote does everything I expected/needed EXCEPT span the 100ft range claimed in the specs. I have direct line of sight (although that shouldn't matter) and the effective operating range is only about 55'. It still works at this distance but is sketchy at best. I tested with three brand new sets of batteries with the same results. Otherwise if my need was only 40' I would have given this 5 stars.
1,Looks Better Than It Works,"Simply put, this has been the most inconsistent device that simply just doesn't work. I should have reported it to the vendor more often as having to power down and restart as they suggested the first time just didn't work. I wanted to try something different from Logitech but I learned a valuable lesson in ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". I contacted support and again, they responded right away and are willing to replace it if it's still under warranty. I purchased it in July 2012 so hopefully it is which I will gladly right another review pending my test."
3,Pointer,I liked it very much. I don't like the requiement the I need to have a number of words to complete this review. Pain in the but.
1,"Broken, after just a few months of occasional use. (1 hour a week)",Look elsewhere if you want quality that will last. If you just want cheap then you have found it. More junk for the landfill.
3,She recommends this product,"I bought this product at the request of another person. But I can say That the delivery was on time, he bought because he liked the price and I think he liked the product."
5,Satechi SP400 Smart-Pointer,"This product was delivered very promptly. It was easy to use. I was able to take it right out of the box and began using it in my classroom during a powerpoint presentation that had already been started when I recalled that I had it. I am pleased with this product overall and was appreciative of the fact that I didn't have to spend a lot of time trying to figure it out; just insert batteries, plug and play."
5,satisfied with Satechi Smart Pointer,"I've been using the Smart Pointer for the lectures I'm giving to classes at a local university. It's very easy to set up and works great. I use a MacBook on which I run both MacOS X and Windows XP. The pointer set up works fine in both systems. There are no problems whether I use Keynote on the Mac or PowerPoint in both Mac and Windows versions.For it's cost, this product is an outstanding value. I have seen pointers for sale at more than twice the price and I can't imagine any can be better than this one."
1,Moderate functionality - inconsistent connection to USB,"I had purchased 5 of these as we were wanting to replace some Hiros that were wearing out. I saw the great reviews and felt that these would be a win. Unfortunately, the mouse function is less than functional. The bidirectional movement does not allow an educator in front of a class of 75 students to be able to quickly move to the desired icon or location on the screen. That low functionality coupled with poor/inconsistent reception to the USB device located in within 50 feet created multiple embarrassed educators. We have a reputation for excellence. These remotes have failed us."
2,Laser Button Didn't Last Long,"I liked this model in every way, but it didn't last, and that's the bottom line. I decided to try a AAA battery powered model because the laser pointer I used before used expensive batteries. I loved this model, but after only a few months of use, the pointer button gave in. It ended up being as costly as the special battery using laser model I had before."
1,didn't last long,"I bought this wireless presenter to use in my classroom. The price, carrying case, fashionable color,and laser feature made it very appealing. Sometimes light weight can be a bonus, but this product just felt too light and cheap. The laser feature never really worked, but advancing from slide-to-slide was fine for a couple of months. Then it just gave out. I was sure it was the batteries, but that was not the case. Soon after, a guest presenter was visiting our classroom & told me that she had purchased the same one & that it turned out to be a piece of junk. Lesson learned: you get what you pay for. (Now I'm on Amazon to invest in something better. My friends have had good luck with Logitech, & I'll probably go that route, too since I've been borrowing from them for months.)"
5,Greate for the classroom!,The use of this item has freed my to walk around my classroom. I don't have to stand at my laptop to use my smartboard.
5,Works as advertised,The port to hook up my computer to the projector is upstairs in balcony of a gym and I wanted to stand on the floor at the other end of the room to teach a Bible study. This device was the only one I could find that had the kind of range I needed (75-100') at a reasonable price. It works as advertised! I have no complaints at all!
4,My clicker!,"I became ""hooked"" on a similar product that my employer had, and when it came up missing I decided to purchase my own. I love this one because it is not just for power point presentations, but can be used as a mouse as well. Great product!"
2,"Ok, but not great","I purchased this remote instead of the logitech one, as it seemed as though it would have more functionality. While I do like that you can use it as a mouse, the range is so poor that it only has a 50% chance of working. I have primarily used it in a classroom size space at maybe 10 feet away and it isn't that reliable. I have used it on both a pc and Mac with the same result. I would not reccomend unless you are standing still right next to your computer."
3,Remote works well. . . . laser a little weak,"I ordered this product because it had both slide advance and mouse function. Each of these work as expected on my macbook pro running Keynote. Great! However, the laser is really weak. I suppose that I should have known better. I am lecturing to a room of 500 and the little dot produced by the built in laser is hardly visible to me when I stand in front of the screen. People 3 rows in can't see a thing. The device has been relegated to our small conference room. Works well for ""around the table"" meetings."
4,SP400 Smart Pointer 2.4 Ghz RF Wireless Presenter,Bought this before leading a school-wide pep rally. Had good range and made it a much easier task!! I know I'll find many other uses.
3,super mario brothers super show off the map,this was a good movie. my 6 year old watched it but did not hold his attenton like other mario movies he has had in the past but the 3 year old loved it and it has a better story line than most mario movies
4,Kept my kids quiet for the duration of the movie.,"So this ""movie"" is a B-rated as they come- meaning extremely low budget and cheesy. It's 75 minutes- but broken down into short episodes. But I ranked it 4 stars because my kids LOVED it. They quieted down and sat still for 75 minutes (all episodes). For my son's Mario-themed birthday party, we had 16 children ages 6 and under and twice when I turned on the movie, at least 14 of them came in the living room quietly sitting on the couch while I prepped for the next birthday event. That being said- I just can't bring myself to give it 5 stars."
2,beware of release date...,"I purchased this item for my little 4 yr old nephew who adores mario bros. and although he loved it, i was disappointed at how old this movie was! the release date for this dvd says june1, 2010. Well it's NOT! it's actually from 1991 so when i got it in the mail, i was a bit hesitant to give it to my nephew but did anyway. although he loved it yeah i would have not bought it if i knew how old it was, it was extremely outdated. :("
1,detox your wallet,"Works on basic chemistry. Salt water reacts to the electrodes, and produced iron/rust. Lab test have proven it with testing the water after a so called treatment. The water will change the same color with or without feet. This is just old fashion smoke and mirrors, snake oil. The fact is that if someone spends money on an item to make them feel better, the mind will tell them it does."
1,"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL","I was a fan of David Bach and his financial perspective, but after anxiously awaiting this book's arrival I was sorely disappointed. It's a dictionary plain and simple with a couple of excerpts from his best-selling books. This does not help explain these financial terms, although I know this isn't true, most people should know 99% of the terms. The other 1% are for people involved in corporate takeovers (and I doubt they are the target audience.) This is a rip off and condescending. I know ATM stands for Automatic Teller Machine and I don't need to know the words orgin. I expected to gain a more well-rounded knowledge of how to apply these terms in my own life, more situational stories. It is simply a dictionary with no discernable use."
4,1001 Financial Words you Need to Know,The book provided basic terminalogy. I found an explanation of abb. very helpful. Many of the terms with which I was already familiar became much clearer in definition.
2,Lost money,"I bought this item on november 2004 to use with my excellent new DSC P100. My expectation was take good shots wtih wide angle, I don't have previus experience with how much mean 0.7X in terms of reduction of scenary angle. With the first photos, I really felt disapointing because the ""wide angle"" is not enough, actually the difference between the scenary angle with the lens and without it, is pretty low.Now I'm searching for lens with bigger reduction, maybe 0.45X"
3,Sony VCL-DH0730 Wide Lens 30MM,Recently purchased this product to take X-Mas photos.Pro - All family members were able to fit in the picture.Con - A shadow is produced at the bottom of pic when the flash is used. This is because the lens protrudes into the flash area.Anyone else have this problem or solved this issue?
3,so-so,"The adapter wide lens provides an ok performance. The adapter with the lens causes pics to be dark. the lens doesn't provide much more than original lens. so, if you want a little more in your pictures and have great lighting, then the adapter may be ok for you. just don't have too high expectations."
3,okay,"Not quite sure what to use these for. Bought them with the Tuitan Quick Disconnect for a couple of extra dollars. But again, they would stick out way too far from the little Bosch PS20 drill i bought. They didn't cost much, so they are still in my garage."
4,Decent quality socket adapters,"I bought these for use with the Rockwell 3Rill impact drill-driver and they work well. The hex end locks solidly into the drill and the square ends hold sockets firmly, but they can be removed easily. I prefer sockets and extensions to be chrome plated, and these adapters would be perfect if they were. But they were inexpensive and they work well."
5,best socket bits,I like using these bits for tightening and loosening bolts. makes things go easier then a regular ratchet or wrench
2,Cant expect much for the money,Its a cheep set. Extensions fit sockets loosely and sockets don't stay on. For under $4 what can you expect.I have replaced them already.
2,Poor quality,"The shaft of each piece is a different length, therefore only one of them actually locks into place on my Makita Impact Driver. Poor quality... But luckily the end is too long so I can grind the end of the two to make them fit."
4,Got extra cash buy two sets,"They work good. I say buy two because they are handy and when you miss place one it sucks. I used them to put together trampelene and drive lag bolts, good for junk yard runs too.BEES THERE EVERYWHERE!!!!!"
5,2nd set,I purchased 1 set of these and then decided to order another just in case I misplace one or break one. They are super low cost and I've used them 4 times in the last couple weeks with my impact drill. An awesome piece of arsenal to have in your box. Period
5,Extension bits,I often thought it would be nice to be able to attach a socket to my cordless drill. Now I can. They work great
5,Good Quality extension socket bits,Pros:Does the job. fits perfectly to the impact driver and to the 1/4 3/8 and 1/2 inch sockets.Cons:Did not really find any.
5,3 sizes of Socket Adaptors,Bought this for the Dewalt impact driver I just purchased these are invaluable to a impact driver owner. Great addition to my driver.
4,Great for home use,"I bought these to be used in my Makita BTD142ZW impact driver with stuff around the house. Long deck screws, lag bolts into the rafters, speeding up the removal of wheel nuts (NOT breaking them loose) and so far they have been great. I've only used them on 3 projects and will update later after some more use."
1,Avoid this product...,Easy... broke the 3/8 in size one in five minutes with moderate force. Bought these because they were cheap... bought a set of Craftsman that have now been through serious abuse- true it cost more ... but just that one time I needed the driver to work (on my boat) it failed. Not worth the aggravation.
1,Weak for an impact driver,"I ordered this set with a Makita corded impact driver. Tried to see if I can loosen up the wheel bolts on my car. Could not loosen one, took out the second and the attachment snapped on the third. It may be just too much to ask of this set. I bought a replacement piece, forged, for more than the cost of the whole set. So far so good, but I am clearly more timid to apply full force. Realistically, with the narrowed part on the hex shank, it may be too much to expect the tool to take the abuse of the impact driver.I believe Amazon should not be recommending this set to go with the Makita driver."
2,rust,"rusted within a few weeks, while still in the package.functions fine.would never buy again basically disposable.the rain in spain falls mainly on the plain."
1,Very poor quality,this is a very poor quality socket adapter set. the first time I used the 3/8 adapter the metal ball flew right out of the adapter. If you want a cheap adapter set I would recommend that you buy it from Harbor Freight.
4,Good Quality,"I needed an adapter to connect my sockets to my cordless drill. I came across these on Amazon for only $3.50. I really only needed them for one repair project I was working on, so I didn't care if they only lasted me for the one use. To my amazement, the are actually built really strong! My craftsman sockets and drive extensions snap on really snug. It took some work to remove them, but it's way better than the alternative (being too lose).You get 3 adapters to fit sockets for: 1/4 inch, 3/8 inch and, 1/2 inch.The quality of these way surpassed my expectations. Now, instead of throwing them away after my project was complete like I expected, I am put them in my tool box with my sockets. I definitely will be using these more often!"
5,hubbys present,came quickly in great condition. My husband loves it. I got it for him for Christmas and he never leaves home without them. Uses them for work.
5,CHRISTMAS GODDESS JUST KEEPS ON WRITING,What more can I say? My husband thinks these along with the other bits that went along with the DEWALT DCK211S2 12-Volt Max Drill/Driver/ Impact Driver Combo Kit make for the perfectly finished garage tool makeover. Which makes me the best gifter ever!
3,complemento,"son accesorios que pueden ayudar con el bosch ps20 para utilizarlo en otro tipo de dispositivos que requieren un ajuste mediano, cumpliò mis espectativas"
5,Quality on a Budget,"I bought these for my porter cable impact driver and they work as advertised. Sturdy, strong and I expect them to last awhile."
4,three piece set,This set of socket wrench adapters fit well into a number of my cordless tools and with the hex shank assure a positive power feed to the sockets used.
3,"just works as discribed, nothing special","These are for light duty use and expect the lock balls to pop out. Great for the around the house urban experience LOL, but your not going to make a living using them every day."
3,Alright for disposable tools,"The bits perform the job of attaching sockets to my drill. The bits don't fit as snug on the sockets as my dewalt extension bit (I lost it somewhere in my house) but the three cost about the same as the one dewalt bit on amazon. They work for disposable tools, but I wouldn't try them with a hammer drill or any project requiring higher force or pressure."
2,"Inexpensive, but barely adequate","Sockets do not stay on the bits.Usable, but not very....Spend a little more, buy something that works well..."
5,great combo pack for a low price...,"If you want the convenience of an battery operated impact wrench, but can only afford an battery impact driver, these bits will do the job as long as your impact driver has enough torque. Even if your impact driver does not have the torque, you can manually loosen lug nuts by hand, and quickly take off all the lug nuts with these extensions...kind of a poor mans way to do it, but....hey! you do what you gotta do! :)I use the 1/4"" and 3/8"" bits with my sockets to quickly re-install bolts on many of my projects. You'll be amaze how much faster you can work with small cordless screw drivers or impact wrench, especially when you are working in tight spaces."
5,good addition,"Order this as a a on to my tool set. workss as promise.Always can use a power drill extension bits for your sockets goes much faster than racheting, makes quick work of a project."
5,Simply great deal,"It does what it is supposed to do. With a prime account, they are only Dollar-each to your door. Unbeatable price!"
2,r,not the best. sockets slip out real easy. i suggest getting a better quality not this set. If you need a cheap set that works then this is ok.
3,Not too bad...,"These extensions are only OK. They don't click in tightly to most bits and extensions, and they wobble a bit.Not high quality, but still function passibly."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this for use with my portable impact driver and the very first time I used the 1/2"" Socket the bearing and spring popped out of place. I have no plans of useing the other extensions but I'm sure they would peform the same."
5,Cheap and useful,"They are exactly as described, no problems. I haven't strength tested them, but at least they spin in my impact without wobbling. Harbor Freight has the same thing cheaper, but these are great."
5,Work great! :-),"I've used this set in my cordless Black & Decker drill a few times now and they work great. Now, I can use my cordless drill not only for drilling and for driving screws but as a nut driver too. :-) Very handy to have around and I recommend the set."
4,SE 3 Pc. Power Extension Socket Bits,I wish I would have bought two set due to the amount of use I have found for these around my shop. it seem like I can never find them when I need them. They are a good product
5,cheap good tools,For this price I received 3 drill socket adaptors for light use and so far they have held up well. those of you looking for adaptors for high torque applications should look elsewhere.
1,Does not always work in standard impact driver spring-chuck,"I have purchased two of these from the same seller via amazon. The first set was perfect and exactly like in the picture with one slot in the shaft for the bearings in the driver chuck to connect. I liked it, and ordered another to have one in a dedicated portable tool chest. The second set was ordered using the same link, but was not the same socket adapters at all. There were two slim slots in the shaft and got immediately stuck in my dewalt 18 volt impact driver. I had to rip it out with the assistance of vice-grips and persistent knocking with a second wrench. The first set is nice, but the second almost damaged my far more expensive tool."
4,Cheap and Effective,"This served the purpose of exactly what I needed, to be able to use my drill with my many socket sets. And for only a few dollars, I cant complain. Obviously this was not made for impact wrenches, but then again neither are drills. :)"
2,Good enough for a few bucks..,"I bought them just to have in a milwaukee kit bag I have. I used the 3/8"" once and put it back in the back with the rest of the attachments and bits. I went to grab it again about a month later, and saw that all 3 of them were rusted to hell. Its fine for what it is, a cheap set of adapters to get you by, but def not high quality. They did hold onto the sockets nicely and didnt crack or bend with an 18v impact on them.Bottom line in my opinion, if you want a set to last you a while and look nice in your toolbox, look elsewhere. If you dont care and just need something to get you by for a weekend, then these will definitely do that."
4,Does fine,What can you really say about this product. It fits in my drill fine and the sockets fit on the end fine.
4,"Clearly low quality, but good value","Update: Haven't given me any trouble, but do add a lot of length which may be a problem in tight spaces. I don't know why most are made this way as they would be much more useful shorter.If you are going to be using these regularly (or in high-torque scenarios), you might want to go with better ones. Though I have not encountered any problems, it's clear from the irregularities that they are of the lowest quality."
4,Helpful power tool addition,Most drills are used for making holes and driving screws. These adaptors allow me to use the power of my drill for driving nuts and bolts as well. It makes it nice that my hands are not as sore at the end of my work day as an assembler.
4,Nice add-on tool product,"I purchased this to use as a second set for my tool bag, I have only used them for low torque jobs but they do the job well. Mostly I am using them for driving the wall bolts for flat screen mounts, so far no problems. Love the price, thats what pushed me to buy them, and the add-on free shipping idea is great too. Would recommend for anyone needing a low torque set or back up set."
5,Grate,I put thees to woor with my millwakee impact with a 115 ft lb every day and havent broken one yeat
5,Socket Bit Set,"I bought this set to be able to basically lessen the need of hand ratcheting a hex bolt. Hand ratcheting is necessary in many applications but when driving long bolts or hex shaped screws that would normally be done by hand, this set helps out BIGTIME. For $3.85, you can't beat it. Its a nice set of attachments to have. Good stuff."
2,It's not bad but if you have the means spend more money...,"You get what you pay for with products like this and I did not pay enough. The product is not 'bad' but unlike a camera or a chair you cannot simply replace it once it is installed. Well you can replace it but it requires a general contractor, a plumber and the loss of the use of your shower for 8 months while you try to find out where the contractor disappeared to after demolishing you shower stall. So six months down the road when you are feeling solvent again after paying for a bathroom remodel you realize you are going to have this for the rest of your life (or until you sell the house) and it could be better. Bottom line is buck up and fork out, buy something REALLY NICE because otherwise you have to live with the disappointment staring at you every morning. Byers remorse rarely kicks in when you buy something of true quality but its almost guaranteed when you cut a corner and save 1% on a big investment like a remodel."
5,This CD Is Amazing!,"For the Melodic Trance connoisseur, you have just found a precious gem. Every song is a good one. It is golden, it really is. You will really beef up your collection with this title and the previous one, equally good, called Ethereal Melodic Trance. Get them ASAP!"
4,The Didache for ordinary people!,"Here is high quality scholarly work on a shelf reachable by an average Sunday School teacher! The book has greek text one the left (average SS teachers may skip this ;-) and his own english translation on the right, for the 16 chapters of the Didache. His delightful commentary follows and gives the reader a quick grasp of the basic use of the Didache as a first century oral means of ""membership training"" under a ""membership mentor."" After reading this short book most hungry minds will want even more. Thanks to DaVinci Code the laity are interested in works that did not make the Canon-cut... the Didache (and Clement I) are considerably more helpful reading than books by Dobson, Hybels, Rick Warren (or me). Aaron Milavec has helped the ordinary person understand the early church through study of the Didache --Keith Drury, Associate Professor of Religion, Indiana Wesleyan University"
3,"5 stars for actual document, 1 star for intro","The translation is quite adequate, the commentary . . . not so much.The introduction closes with the most laughable paragraph included in any book that I actually own.Included are prayers to trees to forgiveness, an equation with virtually all modern industry with ""The Way of Death"", a more than comic helping of self-loathing, and a warning that poor children in the Pacific Northwest may have to bathe in polluted water because of the paper mills (no, even in Washington, are there people so poor that they must bathe out of doors-- while there are some who do, but out of mental illness). Upon reading such drivel, I thought it more than likely that the author wrote it in lip-stick on his bathroom wall.I am sorry to be so rude to the author of such a competent translation, but I can't help it because it is just so wickedly absurd."
5,this IS extreme,"You want a jack like this? then you ARE going to abuse it. I liked the ""extreme"" version but decided I can add all the good stuff myself for less than $10,There isn't a better jack that approaches this range."
5,Built like the 50s,"Solid and tough. Put it to use as soon as it arrived on a 1950 DeSoto that had settled into the ground. No clearance for a hyd jack or forks, the heavy chrome bumper being just a few inches off the ground it was no problem jacking the old tank up and placing blocks under it. No need to always fire up the tractor/loader when this simple tool will easily accomplish the task. Procrastinated and put off buying one of these for far too many years."
4,"great, but watch for loose bolts","Great jack. Able to lift most anything you can get in under. Rusts when exposed to weather.Mounted it to my equipment trailer with 2 bolts. Went to use it 2 days ago, and found the direction lever missing. The lever is held in place by a bolt. They must have not used locktite on that bolt...."
2,Stuck after a year,"Nice jack, but it will need maintenance if you dont use it for a while.I put it inside my Jeep rear seat, and after a year it really hard to release the spring."
4,Worth buying this Made-in-USA Jack,Initially bought a foreign made knock off of this jack. The workmanship on that jack was terrible. Can only imagine how bad it would have looked before they painted it. It was also irritatingly obvious that they used the Hi Lift jack as a pattern to copy. This Hi Lift jack is made in USA and quality is much better. It is well worth the extra $20 to buy USA and keep the business here in America. Also nice to have the the peace of mind knowing that the device holding that load for you was built correctly.
5,satisfied customer,I'm very satisfied with my purchase. It's exactly what I expected and saved a few bucks in the process. The item arrived promptly and in great shape.
5,Fun and Entertaining,"It's very funny comedy about a genie named Jeannie who stuck inside a bottle for 2000 years before finally discovered by astronout named Major Anthony Nelson. Jeannie swore that whoever set her free from the bottle will become her master. Jeannie can make all major nelson's wishes come true. But, Jeannie's magic always cause him in trouble. It's one of the best comedy I have ever seen. two tumbs up !!"
5,Loving this!!!!!!,My one year old knows A - G and 1 - 9. These videos grabs my daughters attention and she has learned soooo much. I hope she continues to advance in this steady pace.
4,Meets expectations,"Some of the examples for the letter seem to difficult for children of that age. An example includes ""goggles"" for the letter ""G"".But it must be that they have researched that this word is frequently used in a child's life and not as hard as I am assuming. Who knows?!"
2,Not worth it.,"This case looks nice, but is hard to get to the camera, and has no room for anything else. Look for a better deal."
1,Not for DSC-V1,This bag is NOT for the DSC-V1. The box says this bag is for DSC-P10/P8/P9/P7/P2. You can not fit the camera in this bag. It's a nice bag though.
2,NOT for 2nd Gen,"I had a DLO armband case for my 1gen and thought it worked great. Got a 2gen and found the case doesn't work very well. After dealing with this for awhile I decided to get another armband, this time one built for the 2gen. Found this on Amazon and had liked my last DLO, so got another. Received this and found it to be the SAME case. This case is built for the 1gen - opening for your earbuds is on the WRONG side on this case, it's a little bit too small (though will work), and the plastic covering isn't positioned quite right to be able to control your scrolling. Very disappointed I spent money to receive exactly the same thing I already had and know isn't what I want."
4,GReat armband,"This armband was a great deal for the price. I like that it came with an armband and it also has the waistband clip that I actually have used. The one downfall is that I have to take out my ipod to lock it and sometimes I can't get my ipod to turn off due to the cover, so then I also have to take it out of the case. It does fit snug in the case so that I am not worried about it falling out. But it also comes out easily if needed."
2,Limited usage,"The Action Jacket fits snug but covers the data port on the bottom. The plastic film covers the wheel and makes it difficult work the controls as you lose the ""feel"" of the wheel. The belt clip is not removable.Bottom line, I took it back."
1,Doesn't even fit,I bought this for my Ipod nano (2g) and it didn't even fit in. It was a total waste of money!
4,The other reviews are right on,"This is better than my last one, but it's got some flaws like the other reviewers have said: 1) it isn't made for my generation iPod (i think it's 2nd), so it doesn't fit exactly right. it's a snug fit; 2) it isn't made for the nike+ foot pod connection, so can't close the strap when the nike+ is plugged in. The problem with that is, when you're exercising, unless the nike+ is facing upwards (i.e., the strap is on the top), the whole iPod will slide right out when you're exercising. But the quality/size/placement of the velcro, etc., are good, so it fits well around your arm without velcro issues."
1,This product sucks! Don't get it for 2nd gen nano!!,"This is a very stern warning. DON'T BUY THIS FOR YOU'RE 2ND GEN NANO! The first time I bought it, it didn't fit. I mean, damn, you need the jaws of life to get it on. Maybe I bought the one made for the 1st gen. Fine. I return it and buy the one that explicity states it's made for the 2nd gen ipod. I put it on and it still doesn't fit! Even worse, I couldn't get the stupid thing off! And I didn't want to scratch or chip my investment (the ipod, not the crappy, poorly designed case). I got fed up and just cut the damn case with a pair of scissors, just to pry it off. Go with the sport armband from speck. A MUCH better product. This awful product, though, gets a -5 stars from me."
5,Very useful,"I use it all the time with my iPod, I have to take the iPod out to use the controls but I can easily slip it back in."
4,Like it a lot.,Fit my ipod perfectly. It even fit my ipod mini despite a little sticking out. So really you can use it for both.. my only complaint is that the fabric is a little uncomfortable on my skin esp when you are running and sweating but it never falls off.
4,DLO Action Jacket Armband,This item has a somewhat snug fit. Can't really velcro the closure all the way. Very nice item overall though.
4,Gift,"My boyfriend bought a different armband and I bought this one. The one he bought didn't fit his iPod, this one fit so we traded. He seems to be very happy with it, especially since there's no sort of cover to it that will peel away like both of our last ones did."
4,Functional but not easy to change using the wheel,well made can be used on your arm or clipped onto your belt.....a bit difficult to change volume or menu selections using the slide wheel.........but EXCELLENT for holding my IPod nano I would buy another
2,spend the money on an actual case for ipods,"This case does its job. It holds your ipod securely while you run etc. There are several drawbacks. It is a very tight fit if you have the plastic protector on your ipod. in order to change the volume, you have to take the ipod out of the case. Trying to use the clear window to change the volume doesn't work. Overall, its okay if you are on a budget. I think I will be investing in an actual case made specifically for the ipod."
2,Nano block,"The armband fit well and the clip on back of unit was great to clip onto waistband. However, biggest drawback was that the Nano controls were partially blocked by the case, unlike the photo in the ad."
3,Cel phone holder,The price was great. I wish the clip had more tension on it. The phone pulls out to easily.
2,Get what you pay for,I believe the cost was 1 cent but shipping was ~$4. The holster is cheap but what would you expect for the price.So far I haven't lost my phone so THAT's a good thing.
3,Just to reiterate....there are better books for beginners,"I just started knitting a few weeks ago and picked this book up at the library. While I love Debbie Bliss' designs, there's no way I'll be making any of these projects any time soon. The first pattern is a bag which is relatively simple but it would take forever to finish it as a beginner as it uses neither big needles or bulky yarn. As a beginner I belive you need to start with a small project to feel like you are accomplishing something. I feel like the book covers a huge range of abilities and thus isn't apptly titled.It does have a good amount of directions on how to do many different patterns which is nice, and like I mentioned before, the designs are good."
3,I would not buy this book again,"I'm not a big fan of this book, really. Here's why:1. It's not at all comprehensive. I've had questions about how to do certain techniques (provisional cast-ons, for example), and the book had nothing on it.2. The instructions were not the clearest. I'm not a beginner, but even I had trouble with a few of the explanations.3. The patterns are not great, but I'm not a huge fan of Debbie Bliss designs in general -- the garments are simply too boxy and bulky for my tastes. The baby blanket and some of the kid garments are ok, though.4. There are some pictures of finished projects that are not actually given in the book.The stitch dictionaries are nice, but not very inclusive, and most of the stitch patterns can be found in either the Harmony Guides or other books by Debbie Bliss."
3,"Not really ""How to Knit""","I am teaching myself to knit. What better book than ""How to Knit""? Right? WRONG.While there are a lot of techniques and a some very good patterns, I would not recommend this for a true beginner. I made project #1, a simple bag. If you've never knitted before, you don't know that you can't cast on 132 stitches on regular needles. You don't know what it means to ""cast off 60 stitches at the beginning of next two rows"".There are recipe books for true beginning cooks that say things which might be obvious to someone more experienced, ""In a bowl, mix"" or ""measure after chopping"". I need a knitting book to approach their patterns in much the same way, explaining EVERYTHING. This book is not that.If you do have some experience or someone you can turn to for interpretation, I could say buy this book, otherwise, find one for REAL beginners."
4,Good Book for Intermediate Knitters,"Debbie Bliss has provided intermediate knitters with a very good resource.While her book does cover the basics of knitting 'how-to', most of it is for those who have had at least some knitting experience.The book is divided into several 'workshops': Beginner's, , Aran , Simple Stitch Patterns , Lace, Entrelac, Color, Decorative Details, Design and Finishing. Each 'workshop' provides instructions with nice illustrations, a sample of stitch techniques, and a project to complete.I like this book as a reference but I am a relatively experienced knitter and I would not be able to use this book very much if I was a beginner."
1,Not fit to knit,"This is NOT a ""definitive course"" in knitting. It is a single DVD with a photocopied ""manual"" of about 3 folded pages slipped inside the DVD cover. The presentation is unforgivably elementary. The contents cover only 10-12 of the most basic topics. The first 6-8 minutes after the introduction is a guide to how to use your video remote. Each button is explained with about a second between each explanation for us to absorb this groundbreaking information. The ""skin"" of the presentation template is attractive showing interesting yarns and colors. Clearly a purchased skin given the divergence from the actual video portion. The actual video portion was filmed against a white screen and is very elementary. My middle school child has produced better product than this. Do not waste you money on this one."
5,"Well, thank goodness","As a beginning knitter with no experienced mentor to ask questions of, making the jump from scarves to ""real"" items was intimidating, to say the least. The patterns were all in another language, and many other books (including those written by Debbie Bliss) often showed beautiful but very complicated patterns. Finding this book was a gift. So that's intarsa! That's how to cable! Best yet, the items made are attractive and useful, so you don't feel like you are doing your homework until the real fun starts. A wonderful resource for those not blessed with an experienced friend to show the way."
4,"Great pictures, explanations etc. First class reference book","I am a self-taught new knitter. I struggled with not knowing at times where the yarn was supposed to be placed etc. I checked this book out of the library and the explanations, diagrams and descriptions are excellent. I have bought this book as reference for my collection. Debbie Bliss keeps the language simple, informative and the projects are good. Not too hard but defintely challenging. She also has good taste and a nice color sensibility. It is like having a knitter by your side. I certainly will refer to this book for a long time."
5,Cute,"I actually did not stick them up, so if you're having trouble getting them to stick you can nail them up like I did. I only nailed them because we live in a rented home and when we move it would be easier to cover the nail holes instead, but it also works because I'm sure my son won't love Cars forever, so it's easily removed anyhow. I think they look great, but I did not order enough, so I am going to have to order a couple more."
2,Same Problem As Won't Stick,I was just sitting in my bedroom and heard what sounded like someone walking on plastic went to investigate and found my sons border half off the wall and still falling
3,Cute but wouldnt stick,"This product was very cute to add to my sons room. However, it would not stick to the walls and kept falling off moments after applying it. Unfortunately we have to return it and go with a prepasted wall paper."
2,don`t stick more than 5 minutes,"Really disapointed , it looks good but it doesn`t stick I followed the instructions and the thing doesn`t stay in the wall :("
2,Partial-Stick,"This ""self-stick"" wall border doesn't stay stuck to the wall's in our son's room. Not sure what the issue is but it keeps coming off."
3,Good,The gum on the border does not stick very well - it kept falling down initially .But overall very easy to apply .My son loves his room.
1,Pathetic!,"This product didn't stick on the wall for more than 5 minutes. We had a freshly painted, clean wall and it just fell right off. Complete waste of money."
1,Bad Product - Does not stick to walls,I was so excited to receive this product and surprise my son by re-decorating his room for Christmas. It took me quite some to put up the border around my son's room - I followed the directions exactly. Everyone loved it and it looked awesome....it really finished the cars theme well in his room. Then about 5 hours later I walked by his room and the border was falling down. I climbed back up on the later and reaffixed it to the wall and really focused on pressing it down well. A few hours later it fell down again. Then I got thumbtacks in the corners to hopefully keep it from falling but the middle of the border sagged and is now only being held up by the thumbtacks. It absolutely doesnt stay affixed to the wall. Really good looking product but the quality is TERRIBLE!! Unfortunately this was a complete waste of money =( I didnt even want to give it one star but i had to. I'm completely unsatisfied
3,Easy to remove.,"We bought our house with a Car's room. This wallpaper was really easy to remove. We just took the top layer off then sprayed the backing with water in a spray bottle. Removes great. Looked a bit cheap as does most wall paper. The design repeats itself over and over. Wasnt a huge fan, but for a quick flare of ""cars"" it works great."
3,Doesn't stick well,"We got two rolls for our son's bedroom and they only stuck for the first day. The day after we hung them up we went in his room and one roll had completely come off the wall and the other one was halfway off. Very displeased, but as there aren't many other Cars borders out there and this one matches perfectly, we are going to just buy some adhesive of our own to hold it up."
4,looks great but...,it looks so cute on our sons room except the fact the it did not stay glued on the wall so make sure u hav wall paper glue to make it stay up...dont put it up without because it will come down and tangle then it will be useless..i would still but it again eventhough i hav to buy extra things for it because it really adds to his room..hope this helped
1,I am so frustrated,I painted my grandson's room because he will be living with me while his parents are deployed in Afghanistan. I bought this border to complete the room and it will not stick to the wall. Why do they state that a border is self-sticking and easy to use if it does not work? I am so very upset. This was expensive and my grandson will be arriving in a few days to find the room incomplete. Is it possible to add an adhesive to make the border work? Has anyone had success with this?
1,HORRIBLE! Don't waste your time/money,"We were so excited to put this border up in our sons new Lightning McQueen room. We had done a border before in his nursery, and it was no big deal. This product, however, was a disaster! It would not stick!! The walls were freshly painted and clean. We even let it hang for a day to straighten out. We even tried using border paste (even though it is supposed to be self-adhesive border)... still nothing!We were able to take the product back to where we bought it and the lady there even said she couldn't get it to work for her.Bottom line: Don't waste your time or money.We are looking for a good rated black and white checkered border to complete the look."
1,THIS SUCKS!,"Bought this product and it didn't stick at all except to one wall in my son's room. Bought some more thinking that maybe the wall wasn't completely dry. Waited a week and tried it again, same result. Called Blue Mountain (the company that makes it) and was told there was nothing they could do and to call Amazon! I'm like, ""It's your product?!!"" DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
1,Can't figure out how to set the time ???,Wery poor user manualVery bad soundVery bad pruductNo # to call for helpMine is going back
1,The author should be ashamed,"Ashamed for capitalizing on a tragedy with this vapid, rush-to-press book. Horrible writing, infantile theories, sensationalistic garbage."
1,More Mainstream Misinformation,"Reader beware! The editors website - Brain-Mind.com - is so full of bizarre material, I don't know how anyone can take any of their books seriously. This book is chock full full of factual errors, for example: on page 194 it says that the Boeing 757 that crashed into the Pentagon plowed a crater 100 feet wide into the ground. Photos of the crash site reveal no such crater. There are many more errors much too numerous to list here. This book is being sold in many supermarkets in the tabloid section and should be regarded as tabloid reading material!Those readers wishing to find out the truth about what actually happened on September 11th. should avoid this book and look elsewhere to more credible sources of information."
4,Would have had 5 if it wasn't for Kanye.,"Smart choice on getting Kanye West to produce most of this album. On the same note. Really stupid choice on letting the brother drop lyrics on this album. Which basically is my only beef with it.Those that listen to Common listen to him for his smart and thought provoking lyrics which you get once again with ""Be"". Kanye just does not have the lyrical skills that the other mc's have on this album and it shows. One track in particular stands out. ""They say"" with John Legend will have you from the first hook, until the verse with Kanye is given really just takes a intelligent and smooth cut and kind of hamstrings it. Other then that the cd is tight and much better then the over eclectic Electric Circus. Go grab it you won't find intelligent hip-hop much during a summer season anyway."
4,"Solid, But Not Quite A Classic.","I'm usually loathe to compare one release by an artist to a previous work, but coming on the heels of the brilliant, sprawling masterwork that was ""Electric Circus"", ""BE"" sounds tame. However,tame in this case, is a beautiful thing. This stands as some of the most beautifully textured and mature music of Common's career. I deduct 1 star for the following flaws; the vocal ad-libs on ""The Corner"" by the Last Poets are utterly ridiculous and totally out of place. The Black Power sloganeering is ineffective, out of touch and laughable in the 21st century, drop it. Secondly, track 5 ""Testify"" is a complete waste, start to finish. The vocal sample overwhelms Common's rhymes, the beat(if you can call it that)never catches on and the storyline isn't a story, this track should have never made the cut. All in all, ""BE"" is a fine addition to any music library and will receive repeated play in my ride and at home!"
4,Classic............ close but not quite,"With raving reviews from Vibe, the Source, and other various sources Common's album seemed destined to be a surefire classic. On the eleven track album, the production is handled mostly by Kanye West, combined with Common's lyrical skills, and thought-provoking content this combination makes a great sounding album with the lyrics to match. The song order flows, the guest apperances are kept to a minimum and common kills every track. With all that said, this album is without a doubt a great album, perhaps the best album out this year; however I do not consider this album to be a classic. Be! does not have that special something that albums such as illmatic, but it does bring something original to the game. I would recommend this album to everyone."
4,great chill rap,"I like all Common albums exept Electric circus that was his disapointing album.But now he is back with this noncomercial album(produced by a comercial producer/mc).It realy suprised me,because i was thinking ""there goes another great MC into a sell outs"".Usualy i dont buy albums by comercial artists,but this time i ll make an exeption and i can recomended to everybody who knows what hip hop should be.KEEP IT REAL.PEACE."
4,Great vibes,"Sounds like the spirit of Marvin Gaye oversaw the production. Mostly strong, one or two bumps in the road, but Common's nice slow flow fits beautifully into the mix."
4,little too much kanye,"common is my favorite rapper, which has been the case for years. i was so excited to get this album... but i was a little disappointed to hear so much kanye on it. i know they are friends and all, but common doesnt need one ounce of kanye to shine. i felt like it was a gimmick to guarantee the album's sales, since kanye is ""so hot"" right now. when it comes to common though, his lyrics always make me stop and think, they grab me when i least expect it. i agree with his lifestyle (veganism...no animal cruelty), and i always admire his progressive way of thought. little less kanye, and way more common and you have a classic album."
3,"ITS ALRIGHT,BUT ONLY 11 TRACKS..AT LEAST FIVE MORE","COMMON DID A GOOD JOB, BUT I FELT HE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER...AT LEAST ITS NOT OUT OF THIS WORLD LIKE ELECTRIC CIRCUS...HOPE HE DOES NOT FALL IN THAT SLOT AGAIN."
5,"""Always fresh""",Another classic release from common. Urban & thought provoking beats. Flippin straight to ya heart raps. Ill all around. You'll never get tired of it.
5,Simply DOPE!,"To put it simply this is just a beautifully written, well thought out album. I cannot recommend it enough. If your worried about it being 'too much' Kanye West then dont be, I was but suddenly realised that it gives the album a consistent flow, which is missing in so many modern hip hop albums."
3,come on guys be real it's just OK,"c'mon guys be real it's just OK. Best rap album 2005? man if that is true then the music is at a low. the songs sound nice enough, in that kanye way. this sound will sound terribly dated and out of style in about, well, five minutes. nothing here to really remember. common has always perplexed me. i generally like his mc style and his lyrics can be inspired at times (other times not so much - like i said, c'mon, be real) but i went through the whole thing in one go without ever feeling i needed to hear a track a second time. i'll probably throw it on a few more times and enjoy it just like i enjoy laying by the pool or walking my dog. but at the end of the day, hip hop ain't supposed to just sound nice. hip hop needs to be urgent and vital or it really means nothing. this album means nothing. buy it for your mom and she'll like it too."
5,An Instant Classic,"Kanye and Common did their thing on this album. One of the best of the year, cant wait for ""late registration"""
3,"pretty good,but kind of desperate","Common is One of the Most gifted MC's Ever. the Cat has words&subject matters downpat for days,minutes,seconds,hours,etc... I've always said&felt that the same thing that makes Common good is also the same thing that holds him back.He is very knowledgable,but also Heavy-Handed to the point that you can go either way with him. this album mainly suffers from the Kayne West syndrome of too much shine&Polish.I know Kayne is the ""IT"" Cat in Hip-Hop at the moment,but dude got his stamp way too much on this Project.but hey that is the politics of the game.I truly Believe that common has that knock-Out Albm in him yet,but going for that acceptance this being his 6th album makes me wonder how much more might He sacrifice in the future to being fully accepted??"
3,"C'mon now, Common.","Is this it? If this is the album I wanna hear the throw-away cuts. For real. If your bold enough to only have 11 songs, at least have 9-10 straight bangers! I think the current state of hip-hop has lowered peoples expectations. I'll give him 5 out of 11. Far from classic. One of the greatest gifts my mom ever gave me before she died was the ability to NOT judge people based on skin color. So when I hear Common say ""Black men walking with white girls on they arms, I be mad at 'em, as if I know they moms"", it's like, huh? Something that ignorant coming from rapper so-and-so wouldn't have even caught my attention. But coming from Common it's dissapointing. Better luck next time, I guess."
3,Like Common Sense,"Decent album! Kanye West aint Tim, nor does he possess the diversity of Pharell and Chad, he (West) is a credible knob turner. Common does not disappoint!"
1,Absloute rubbish,"Poor copy of a bad VHS. YOU WON'T ENJOY WATCHING THE PICTURE AT ALL, WE COULDN'T. SELLER SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES AND HOPEFULLY WILL GET RIPPED OFF BY OTHERS WHO DO CROOKED BUSINESS LIKE THEMSELVES."
5,Must have for Shih Tzu owners,As a trainer and breeder of Shih Tzu for over ten years I highly reccomend this book. It has great practical advise and is full of great pictures and stories. I give this to all my Shih Tzu puppy buyers. Enjoy your bundle of joy!!!
3,learning about a ShihTzu,This book was somewhat helpful. It was interesting to know about the personality of this breed. But I have a lot of unanswered questions now that I have had the puppy for two weeks.
3,"BACK TO SCHOOL! (oh, yeah and some other 'peewee' nonsense)","Peewee's big adventure is easily one of the most popular and beloved movie scores out there. It's dynamite! Who can argue with that? The 3 stars that I do give the CD are solid. Unfortunately, there is only 20:43 of Big Adventure here. No incidental music. And apparently the only available version of the score. I have no problem with Back to School's soundtrack, but Peewee's is pure magic. Of all of Elfman's work, Peewee's most deserves to be heard, complete. Very disappointing."
3,The DVD does have the original score,"""Thank you"" to all the previous reviewers who pointed out the limitations of this re-scored music. I thought I'd chime in with a discovery. The DVD of the movie has the isolated original score! Yeah!If you buy or rent the DVD, just go into the menu options and there's a way to play the movie with only the music score isolated. (There's commentary by Danny Elfman too, but he doesn't talk over the music.)"
3,It's Okay But There Isn't Enough Of The Music From The Pee Wee Movie!,"I like Danny Elfman, he writes movie scores that are always great and one of his best is the score for Pee Wee's Big Adventure and while the Pee Wee tracks with the National Philharmonic Orchestra are great it would have been even greater if they had used the original master tracks and the scores on this CD are just too short. I have never watched the movie Back to School and that score does seem to overshadow the Pee Wee's Big Adventure score. Now I do recommend this CD but be prepared to be a little disappointed with the Pee Wee score getting the short end of the stick!"
1,I want an actual Pee Wee's Big Adventure Soundtrack CD too!,"Well, Pee Wee's Big Adventure is on the Hub a Cable Channel right now. During the Rube Goldberg breakfast scene, I turned the volume WAY up.It sounded fantastic. I LOVE that music.So I would LOVE a whole, actual Soundtrack CD of Pee Wee's Big Adventure."
4,Boring (Especially For Me) But Does Seem To Help,"This is simply a CD of songs that repeat addition-related math facts over and over to different tunes and in different patterns. I bought it at the same time asSubtraction Songsand play both in my car, for my 2nd grader (with my twin 5-year olds also listening.) I find it extremely dull, but the kids actually like it, and sing along. In some places the CD stays silent in the answer portion, so that the kids are supposed to sing along and fill in the blank, which they like. It does seem to be helping my daughter with the rote memorization of these math facts needed to do well on the timed math tests many schools begin at this age. And it is certainly less painful than flash cards, which both my daughter and I hated.I don't think my kids would listen to it at home though, it is really best used in a car, so if you have some regular car-time and need some math facts enforcement, this is a good option."
1,"Oh, so boring.....","The only place I could hold my children captive long enough to listen to these very ""un-catchy"" tunes was in the car. That proved to be a mistake, because these ""songs"" are somewhat hypnotic and practically put me to sleep! This purchase was a waste of money for my family. (And my son learned to add just fine without them.)"
4,"Great projects, but difficult to follow at times.","I like the animal projects (including but not limited to: elephant, cow, raccoon, tiger, and of course, anteater) but the ""guide to basic folds"" included in the book could be better (more clear), and as an inexpirenced folder, I found most of the projects too hard to follow and complete. If you get this book and can do the anteater, I need your help. --Phil Stokoe"
2,Be careful you get what you want,Product wasn't what we were looking for. These are not typical suspenders. No stretch but great for holding up a tool belt. Amazon was very gracious on this return! Thanks!
3,Had to Return,"This particular model was supposed to fit our truck, which is a 2008 Dodge Ram 1500. The length was ok, but not the height of the part that covers the outside part of the tailgate. When my husband took off the factory piece that came with the truck, there were factory holes in the metal. This piece does not cover those holes!So sorry to say, it went back. I would have just given one star, but if you happen to have a dodge truck with no pre-installed tailgate cover at all, maybe you won't have the factory holes to worry about. So I thought I'd give 3 stars just in case it could work for some trucks. Other than the scant coverage, it seems to be made well."
2,Roomy... poor quality,"The tent is generally OK, but the poles are awful. One ferrule started to bend after the first use and I had to hammer it back into place. The second trip was OK but on the third trip, yet another ferrule disconnected and had to be re-crimped to work it. So with only three camping trips, I had trouble on two of them. Tried to get the poles replaced only to find out that the warranty only covers 'manufacturing defects.' You get to pay for shipping to send your poles to them and they'll tell you whether it's a real problem or not. Just getting a replacement pole was going to cost me almost fifty percent of the original price. Save your money with this company."
2,Does it make a difference?,"The answer is that I cannot tell an appreciable difference in proximity. In addition, you need an adapter to use it and this has to be bought separately. I would not buy it if you expect to get much closer to the subject."
1,Bad Lens,I bought this lens for my P10 Camera. All pictures I made with it are blurry. Autofocus does not work with this lens. Do not buy this piece of junk!
3,okay shirt,"Well, it's a nice shirt, but the 15 1/2 collar is large on my neck relative to the other 15 1/2 dress shirts that I own. Also the button tab seems really tight over the necktie knot to the point where it sort of bends the collar a bit."
2,misleading reviews,"I wasn't really a fan of older Android Lust material. It always seemed a little cheesy and melodramatic to me. So, naturally I was interested when i started seeing ads and reading reviews for this release. I was also very happy to see DVM in operation, as I am quite fond of I, parasite. Anyway, I ordered the CD and have to say that I'm dissapointed with it. Granted, the production value of the CD is great. I just can't get into it because I don't feel like it goes anywhere... The drums sound very stiff and rigid... and though the vocals aren't effected as much than on the older CD's (don't get me wrong I don't like overly effected vocals) I just didn't get into them at all. I don't know... This CD was definately not for me, but maybe it would be perfect for you!"
2,Very disappointing,"I rarely am moved to write reviews unless an album is really good or really bad. I was a big fan of the earlier albums, Revolution and Evolution, but Dividing isn't up to par. Most of the tracks sound like market-driven, formula industrial. Shikhee is capable of much better than this. The only worthwhile track is the mournful siren song of Burn.Furthermore, the album will not play on your computer AT ALL. I've tried all three of my boxes with different operating systems. It just gives you an artsy-fartsy flash presentation and an uninspired mp3 remix of Burn. The RIAA definitely has their hand up this one (which further supports my theory that this album was about cashin' in instead of showcasing Shikhee's talent).In a nutshell, you're better off buying an earlier album by Android Lust."
5,A perfect ransition tool,"Richard Harrington has gift for presenting a complex subject in a straight forward, easy to understand way. Knowing how to use Photoshop is not a guarantee of success in video editing. They are two separate disciplines, and this video goes a long way in bridging the gap. It is recommended for anyone new to video and who is trying to integrate elements from Photoshop into their work. Highly recommended."
5,It was everything I needed to pass.,"I thought that Holme and Thomas did an excellent job of writing a book designed to help students prepare for and pass the 70-290 exam. They provide a credible alternative to memorizing the thousands of pages in the win2003 Admin Companion, Deployment Kit, Security Guide, etc. The authors were able to distill it down to a dozen or so chapters, plus additional recommended readings before taking the test. Some other reviews seem to criticize it for being disjointed, but the book is clearly designed to help you pass the test, not administer a server (there are lots of other good books for that). Two weeks after buying this book I passed the test on my first try. 'Nuff said."
4,Just the right level,"I enjoyed working through this book. It was written in a pleasant administrator to administrator style, and I especially liked the ""Why this chapter matters"", and ""Troubleshooting Labs"". Nice touch.What I especially appreciated, is that the exercises don't take you through every mouse click. They often just say ""do this"". If you don't know how, you can find out using online help, but it doesn't waste the time of those who (should) know how.Just the right level for me, coming from Windows 2000 server, and a vast improvement on the Windows 2000 training guide!"
1,HORRIBLE test prep from Microsoft,"This book was one of the WORST test prep books I have ever used, across ALL fields.The book skims the surface of various topics, and if indeed all the test wanted you to do was have a superficial knowledge of how to ""sort of"" get things done, you'd be set.However, the 70-290 test requires you to have an in-depth knowledge of how to get around the 2003 environment, something which this book IN NO WAY prepares you for.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you want to pass your test! It will give you a false sense of security and knowledge.Oh, and the CD that's included WITH the book? It references ANOTHER book throughout all 400 test questions! Want to look something up from the test review to study it better? TOO BAD! It's in ANOTHER book!Again, let me state, do NOT buy this book if you want to prepare for the 70-290. Perhaps buy it if you're preparing to prepare for the test, or want a generalized overview of Server 2003."
1,Never again...,"If those books, called self preparation kit, are supposed to prepare you to exam, without the need to attend to course, then this is plain rubbish. I know that I'm late for party, but If anyone of you still consider buying this book and still has chance to take 70-290 exam, then search for something better. This book doesn't cover GPO at all, doesn't even mention it, dosen't cover Certificates and many things that appears on exam and lack of this will really help you to fail. Hopefully there are other ways to prepare to that exam."
3,Helps to get the job done,This book alone covers about 85% of what you need to know to pass the test. I would recommend a cbt or transender on the topic as well.
1,A complete waste of money,"This book had a lot of promise - lots of lab activities, a sample copy of Server 2003, a CD with sample test questions, and even a 15% coupon off the cost of your certification exam. But I only made it to chapter 3 before giving up in frustration. The lessons are disorganized and hard to follow, the labs skip steps, and some of the review questions at the end of the chapter don't cover stuff discussed in the chapter. I think the final clincher was the lab where I had to create user accounts from a command line for ""Danielle Tiedt"" and ""Lorrin Smith-Bates"". With all the text I had to type, why not use a simple name such as ""Bob Smith"" so I don't have to worry about typos?"
2,Don't count on,"Chapters are very informative and a must read. However, answers of the Objective review questions in the book are not matching with the answers of the same questions in the CD.Example: Objective 5.3 Questions section, question #3 has ""(A)THe server will continiue operating and no data will be lost."" as correct answer.The same question on CD is answered as (B) All data will be lost, a stripe set rather than RAID-5 is required for fault tolerance.""And the erreta has no correction to that along with other mistakes.CD has also incomplete question lines and poorly constructed questions."
2,Look elsewhere,Poorly written and way out of context. My advice to anyone wishing to learn the real ins and outs of 2003 server would be to buy Mark Minasi's book - he offers much better advice geared towards the real world and his chapter on DNS is far superior to the drivel written in this publication.I particuarly dislike the monotonous tone that so often is the down fall of Microsoft publications.On the upside - this book is given it's blessing by *Microsoft* - so it must have something going for it. The section on Group Policy is not bad.However - just go to Borders and compare the difference - Minasi's book on 2003 server is *the* bible to have with regards to decent technical writing and explanantions of real world situatios with regards to 2003 server.
1,Another disappointing MS Press Title,What do you get when you take the Exam Objectives off the Microsoft site and add a bunch of random filler? Another disappointing MS Press title. I use to be able to rely on a MS Press book to get me through an exam (along with my extensive experience). I remember when MS Press meant something. Here I am with a NT4 and 2K MCSE and after reading this book fail the test. I knew something was wrong as I read the book. There is/was NO DEPTH. If you are studying for the 70-290 go elsewhere.
1,Not for beginner,I bought the whole set of MCSE. I took the first one 70-290. I found that it is difficult to follow.
1,useless for veterans or newbies,"If you get handon experience with Windows admin, you will pass even without this book. If you don't have experience, you will fail for sure with this book.So this book is useless for both. As a reference book for exam, I think this book is not well target at all! consider the contents in this book and what covered in the real exam."
1,I'm not sure what book everybody else was reading,"This book was terrible. It was disjointed, and very difficult to follow. The organization and flow made no sense to me, and I felt the author, as it typical with MS Press, was long winded. In addition, the additional study tools were useless, unless you had some additional background. Needless to say, I failed this exam, and this book is to blame."
5,curio cabinet light,Perfect light to use in your curio cabinet. the shipping wasfast and it does a good job highlighting whatever you are displaying.
4,Finally good black sugar free Licorice,This is the best sugar free black licorice I have found to date. This has a good strong licorice flavor up front with a good salt taste in the back of the flavor. I also did not detect any funky after taste. My only complaint is the delivery system. And that is the only reason for the four stars. I found I needed to put about four of those little bears in my mouth at a time to have a small mouth full. And the problem with that required me to chase them around in my mouth while eating them. They are also not all that soft and chewy. And require pretty good teeth to eat them. But all in all they are very good and I would never hesitate buying them again. And I am very particular! I am still looking for some really good sugar free Red Licorice?
2,Not very tasty,"With pre-diabetes in our family and we love licorice, these sounded like a perfect treat, but not to be. Not tasty or even pleasantly sweet.Will discard and not purchase again."
5,Gustaf''s sugar free licorice bears,If you love black licorice but can't or don't want the sugar you really should give these a try. Me and my brother think they are great. They are soft and have a good flavor.
1,Yuk,"If you like Licorice, DON'T buy these. If the manufacturer had spent another nickle on licorice extract this candy might be palatable. The consistency is fine, like a soft gummy bear. The flavor is severely lacking. What flavor there is is almost acrid. The manufacturer also missed the mark on the nutritional information. Each package is 7 oz. The per serving information is listed for a 42 gram serving with no indication as to how many pieces that is. There is also caution about eating too much will cause you lower tract distress, but again, there is no indication as to how much is too much. Since there were both positive and negative reviews I thought I'd take a chance. I did and I lost. Be forewarned and don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Hard Tasteless Licorice,"If you like soft sweet chewable licorice candy, don't buy this brand. It is very hard to chew and lacks the traditional licorice flavor. This was a waste of money."
1,BUYER BEWARE...HORRIBLE,"YOU CAN'T CALL THIS PRODUCT LICORICE...HAS AN AMMONIA TASTE AND GAVE ME GAS. IN RETURNS IT SAYS THERE ARE NO RETURNS, YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH THE MOST HORRIBLE TASTING BLACK BEARS. ANY ONE THAT GAVE THIS PRODUCT A FAVORABLE REVIEW IS LACKING THE SENSE OF TASTE. I HAVE BEEN BUYING THE VINE BRAND LICORICE WHICH IS GREAT, AND WILL THROW GUSTAF'S SUGAR FREE BEARS IN THE TRASH BIN."
2,Tastes Like Amonia,I am not sure how good something can be for you that tastes distinctly like amonia.
1,Not for ME!!,"I hesitate to rate this product because taste is an individual thing. However, I tried to give this product away to anybody who would take it at work...and no one would take it!The licorice flavor is very different, if one could really call it licorice.I would not recommend you invest in a quantity of this product unless you KNOW that you like the flavor."
2,Shoe cpontinually falls off foot,Shoe is not well secured around the heel of the foot and would frequently fall off of the foot. With diabetic neuropathy I am not always aware of when it does this and several times and to look around the house to see where the shoe fell off at. There needs to be a strap towards the rear of the shoe.
3,One big epilogue for all the previous books in this series...,"I won't rehash what other people have already said, I know skimming through the same thing gets tedious.I love this author, but this wasn't one of her better novels. The main plot, second-chance love, got lost among the horde of the secondary characters, and their children and grandparents and their servants, and..... you get the idea. You really see very little story about the main couple.If you've seen these people in the previous novels, it may interest you, but if you have not, like myself, you will find yourself being bored to tears. Sorry to say, I couldn't finish this."
2,Printing quality really bad,Quality of print is pretty bad for the price. The content is outdated. Not worth the money.
2,a bit outdated,"It was an interesting book when it was published.It has neither the experience of Geoffrey McNeil-Moss - an Army officer who wrote the Epic of the Alcazar right after the siege and met real actors of the events, nor the advantage of the present day historians who have access to recently discovered documents and photos."
3,Quality not as expected. Not a perfect product.,"Bought this Koehler for a remodel, to replace a Koehler that had significant scratching on bottom of basin and was less than 4 yrs old.Enamel coating was not consistent with company's description of being thick and harder than our pans. Had a few thin spots where cast iron is slightly visible. Installed for less than a year, it started showing scratches from normal use. Seldom have used scouring agents, most often just cleaning with the scouring side of a 3M sponge.Now, 2 yrs in use, and bottom has significant scratching clearly visible. Has not lived up to Koehler's self-hipe. Instructions did not have info on how to handle this and currently their website does not either.As far as design, it is great. The large side is perfect for those large roasting pans, and the small side is great for drip-drying washed items."
1,Junk,The bagpipes are junk and a waist of money. Holes not fully drilled. The reeds don't play or sound anything like a bagpipe. it sounds like a party horn. The video instructions for assembling them Are a joke and the instructor is from a Third World country you can't understand him and the video quality is 1980s ripoff for $154
3,Okay book.,"The first 3 books in the series were great and prompted me to purchase ALL of the books in this series. I have since found out that the author of the first 3 books is NOT the author of the others in the series and it is obvious. It is still a quick read but I was irritated that the team was so focused on eating. It was always about eating. Granted, the team has to eat but I don't need to hear about it everytime they sit down."
3,Cajun Anger - 'No Trespassing' (Cellar Records),"Sort of tough to describe,but I'll do my best...melodic thrash,MAYBE.One simply could say they're a decent metal band.Most of the cuts here were decent,I thought anyway.Tunes like ""Twisted Fate"",""Pot Of Gold"" and ""Psychotic Fantasy"" appeared to feature some nicely penned song arrangements intact.I looked around online and wasn't able to find much info on this group.A decent find."
5,A very good and complete concert suite,"Before buying this CD I only had, from ""The Sea Hawk"", the very good recordings of Charles Gerhard, produced by George Korngold, who also produced this CD. But they were two extracts in two separate records. This suite is the work of the composer's son, and it is easy to notice, in the booklet, his intention to leave for posterity a new, good and complete recording of the incidental music his father composed for ""The Sea Hawk"". And he succeeded. The recording is very good, the cues are well chosen, forming a real ""Symphonic Poem"", and sound quality is also, at least for me, very good.A good companion for a collector, together with the already mentioned Gerhardt's recordings in the early seventies, is the original sountrack released by TSUNAMI, with extremely good sound quality, considering the age of the recordings."
2,Bad Design,"What the description doesn't tell you is that the SD card does not fully insert into the player. In fact, half the SD card sticks out. Not only can it fall out but it can also be bumped and lose its connection. When it worked, it worked as advertised. However, I bought this for working out and the design just does not work for that. I returned this product and bought something else."
5,cute little thing,great addition to my sony V1. very sturdy. well built. looks great. it comes with a carrying case and a soft towel to wipe it down with. overall good.
4,Nice but short,"Nice little tripod, but ended up a lot shorter than I thought it would be. Well built though."
2,"Lasted two years, then failed","This is not a very convenient tripod, there are much better options out there that will attach more easily to unstable surfaces. This tripod actually is difficult to use, you have to unscrew to move around the camera's direction and then screw back on. Works better with really small & light cameras as opposed to mid-size Point & Shoots like mine. The screw become really difficult to use after continuous use, and then eventually failed."
5,Absolutely wonderful!!!,"A similar tripod I owned was great if it's paint hadn't begun chipping after 1.5 year of gentle use; since I've only had this tripod for about 2 months, I hope Sony's paint is more durable! Otherwise, this is one of the shortest compact tripods that becomes one of the longest when its legs are fully extended. This makes for better camera height and angle versatility especially when used on or at near ground level. It's also sturdy enough to hold any typical (not just Sony) point and shoot digital camera (I have not used it with a camcorder) stable even if mounted sideways for vertical pictures. Furthermore, this is the only tripod I found that comes with a pouch; it's wonderful in avoiding scratches and other damage if you tend to store your camera and its accessories in one bag."
3,Table Top Tri Pod,"This product works great as long as you keep in mind it's a tiny tri pod. But that help's in some respects because I use this as a perch in most respects. It allows you to put your cam corder in tight spaces and leave it. For nature shots, for ""What Really Happened at the Party last night"" shot's it's Ideal. They don't stress it enough but I will in door use only and that's about it."
5,Great tripod for a small camera,"Very, very small tripod which is great for a small camera. The legs have two friction extensions and rubber feet. It comes with a little pouch and a lens cloth. I've used this tripod for an Olympus Stylus 600 (small pocket camera) and Olympus C3020 (point&shoot; at 14 ounces). Perfect companion for your small camera, well made and looks good too!I give this tripod 5 stars even though it has only one drawback:The tripod is just not sturdy enough for a mega-zoom crossover or DSLR. I now use an ""Ultra-Pod II"" for a Canon SX1-IS (at 1.1 pounds)."
5,Great tiny tripod,This tripod is tiny ... smaller than most table-top tripods but it's better built and sturdier than my previous tripods of this type. Surprisingly it can hold even a mid-size DSLR with a mid-size lens (for example my 40D with 17-55mm F2.8 lens). The included bag seems a nice and useful addition.
5,Lots of useful information!,this book has helped me tremendously in my CA Real Estate Escrow class. it provided me with adequate information to use on the state exam and in class exams. i highly highly recommend this book.
2,The Original Bobby Vinton version is not the CD,I bought this years ago. I have to give it a low rating because the original Blue Velvet by Bobby Vinton is not on the CD.
5,Stylish & well made Mighty Mighty Broncos t-shirt!,Very pleased with this t-shirt & the entire buying experience through Amazon. Would definitely buy again.
5,Best Reference EVER!,"I'm awaiting the next edition. I believe (hope) they're waiting for the last Century to ""offically"" end (Rumor) before the next edition. FYI: the first day of the 21st Century is 1/1/2001."
4,"Great statistics, but the CD is a catastrophe","This is a great book of sport statistics, but the CD is a catastrophe. It didn't work on Win98, it didn't work on Win95, it even destroyed the registry of Win 3.11, and it seems to be incompatible with Microsoft Office (and I'm not a computer beginner). This book is also available without the CD, so my recommendation is to buy only the book."
3,Book - great; CD is rotten.,"The book is great for baseball statistical fanatics, but the CD would not work on my machine. I made numerous calls to Macdigital with no response. So I recommend the book but not with the CD."
4,Ok for the times,"Didn't know it was such an older movie. For the time it was made, I guess it fits, not for children to watch."
4,A Wonderful Compendium of Sly's Early Work,"This collection is a collection of Sly's production and writing work for the Autumn label. It has a number of Sly originals which are capably performed by Sly in the early 60's beach and doo-wop style, as well as work he wrote and produced for others on the Autumn label. If you are a fan of Sly or of early 60's soul, you will thoroughly enjoy this album."
4,A TOTAL JAYNE DELIGHT! CAMP! CAMP! CAMP!,"This movie is a howl from beginning to end! If your a Mansfield fan, you'll love it! Jayne looks fantastic with her overprocessed cotton candy bubble hairdo. She's Funny, sexy, and camp, all at the same time. As far as Jayne's later career b-movies, relying on Jayne's name to make it worth seeing, this IS THE ONE! BUY IT! You'll watch it more than once..... Guaranteed!"
3,Brings Back Memories!,"I saw this movie on late night television back in the early 1970's. Certainly not a great movie, but Jayne Mansfield has always been fun to watch. I give it 2 stars for moviemaking and 4 stars for nostalgia. The picture quality is very good, the extras are poor, but it satisfies all my expectations."
2,Dog Eat Dog is a Turkey.,"Not good on any level, though passable as camp. If the actors didn't repeat all their lines five times, this film would be eight minutes long. Not Agatha Christie and not ""Reservoir Dogs,"" this film's closer ancestors are ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" or ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" though lacking their delightful excess. You'll be entertained for ten minutes, checking your watch after twelveThe bonus features are the best part, but total maybe seven minutes long. Mostly interesting was the fact that Jayne, who's pitifully washed up in the film, wasn't 33 years old."
3,Predictable,"Contains every cliche of Spanish musical expression so you know it's Spanish. There is some Morrocan or is it Gypsy wailabing? Nothing challenging or innovative here, all very safe and comfortable. It might move you. It bored me."
5,"Oh, my!","If you consider eating at Taco Bell as dining on fine Spanish cuisine, this is for you.If you enjoy hearing every Spanish musical cliche known to man, and then some, this is for you.If you like sound effects, MTV-style musical glitz and are an avid follower of Spanish novellas, this is for you.If the music of Soler, Falla, Albeniz, Granados, Gerhard, Ginastera, John Adams--and yes, also the Gypsy Kings--is unfamiliar to you, this is for you.Five stars for deception."
5,I love it!!,It really is what I expected. Nice and long lasting fragrance. I will def. buy it again and will recommend the product to my friends.
5,body wash,"I really like this wash. It smells great and is not over powering. Also, my husband does not complain about it making his eye water as some others do. It's great and I sometimes buy it to give as gifts."
5,Great product!,I also had trouble finding this item at the dept. stores! I will buy again for sure. I use in the bath and the scent is wonderful!!! Thanks for the quick service.Tempe
2,This tape is for the Novice,"The Title is MisleadingThis video should be called ""Write to get a Job"". Most of the video is about how to write a resume and follow-up letters. Write your way up the corporate ladder connotes advice for people who are already employed who want to be promoted. I was disappointed."
5,Great Wrench,"OK, this wrench is heavy (at least for me!) but totally worth every penny. It has a great measuring tool on the head to show you how far you have ratcheted. A GREAT tool!"
3,girls will be women,not a bad movie about hell school and what some girls have to endure.the movie follows in the same path as mean girls.it's going to be a movie for teens or parents as a learning tool.but will not appeal to everyone.
1,great movie - but: another Pan&Scan DVD,"This movie has been filmed in widescreen - like all movies today. Sadly, we only get a P&S; Fullscreen DVD. What the....?Despite that, the movie itsself is very good and needed to be seen"
3,My daughter loved it!,"My daughter & I watched this movie togehter and she loved it. We had recently watched the Chrissa movie, similar theme but much more in-touch with middle school-aged girls. Just be aware that there is a little bit of profanity, a few words that your daughter hears every day in middle school!"
1,i read the first two chapters........,".....and i had to put it down. The little boy 'jamie' annoyed the mess out of me. He is a little two year old that acts like he is at least five. he has the manners of a much older child even for the regency era, and he speaks much better than my own five year old and she never shuts up! i get annoyed when authors write the child talking like an adult. a two year old would barely be talking in complete sentences and reading this book was like having a itch that you just can't scratch. Maybe i put the book down too early but when i feel like i want to throw said book against the wall and shake the author for ruining a wonderful plot, it is time to go into the trash heap."
2,Disappointing,"The sequel toThe General's Daughter (Zebra Regency Romance)was truly disappointing. I'd looked forward to reading about Philip and Isabella because I enjoyed their story in the previous book but this was not well executed. When featured in their own book the characters appeared to have lost the growth and depth they'd attained as secondary characters. I found it nearly impossible to root for them as individuals or as a couple.A number of reviews have touched on the ridiculously precocious two year old but the largest hurdle for me was that the author never addressed what his parents planned to do with him. Admitting Jamie's true parentage would have created a huge scandal; Isabella would've been completely ruined whether Philip married her or not. And neither of them ever addressed how they were going to handle the presence in their household of an intelligent, illegitimate child who would've been the heir if his father hadn't been such a selfish gutless prat."
4,Real morality takes guts!,"""Real morality takes guts."" (p. 224). This is a profoundly moral book that is sorting out the choices people (especially men in this story) make. One can feel throughout the book that the author is coming from a deep sense of faith in religious, personal values long associated with simple working class, farm, rural, mountain people in the American South. ""All the rustic learning in his growing years was to be anything but a fraud...A man's word was his sacred honor."" (The passages of respect for women should be in schools for discussion with young people.) As we read this story, we too are gripped by a nostalgia to ""drink from the old well the water that was magic with its power to restore feelings of well being."" (p. 171). And there is poetry, ""The murmur of pines in a summer breeze always seems to sing of eternity."" (p. 243). With the scope of Biblican history, John Rice takes us from the ancient hills of Judea to Shands Cove in Southern Appalachia."
2,Missing banjo playing from Raising Arizona.,The Raising Arizona part of the CD is almost exclusively electronic and only one 90 second track of the great banjo that I remember from the movie. I recommend listening to samples before you buy.
5,Superb Early Burwell,"I still think Blood Simple is one of Carter Burwell's best scores, and to get that along with Raising Arizona - a completely different style and mood - on one CD is a great deal."
3,Burwell's Burrs,"Carter Burwell's music fits. I mean, if you like the zany but inescapable reality that the Coen Brothers (and you must or you'd not be reading this review)create, you gotta like Burwell's music. As a classical music fanatic and celtic music main-liner, I think the OST to Miller's Crossing is pure magic. I mean, the opening oboe solo [I'm an oboist] still haunts me (titled, The Long Way Around, in the album-- the melody is the well-knownLament for Limerick, but here woven into a great piece). OK. The album's great. Buy it. Listen. Enjoy. Burwell's a damn good arranger and imaginative composer."
2,Sons of the Pioneers,"The song ""Way Out There"" was done back in the 40's by the Sons of the Pioneers, a group of singing cowboys that once included Roy Rogers. They would sing and yodel in 4 or 5 part harmonies. They were amazing but mostly forgotten now a days."
4,"sensual voices, blockbuster song","Three girls in a great voice union.The single includes four tracks: an extra song and three overload version.The star is the first track, the original version: very sensual and rythmical voices with a soft but dinamyc instrumental help."
5,Patsy,"Patsy's cd is awesome...every time i go with my grandparents (one happens to be Cynthia Johnson who wrote a review) we HAVE to listen to it! I have 2 copies and i had Patsy sing at my school because i thought everyone else should hear her. Patsy is my piano teacher and she is THE BEST! (sorry grandpa, your good too though) If you don't belive me you should buy her cd and listen for yourself..."
2,Very simple basic stuff,"This was not particularly useful to me. It contained very rudimentary information, mostly common sense stuff. I was looking for a much more detailed description of high-end waitstaffing, or something more in-depth about the tricks of the trade. This was a very matter-of-fact, limited description of the work. It felt like something from a High School Guidance Councilor's office."
2,2 stars for pattern not for corelle,Didn't like the pattern at all when it arrived. It looks a bit different in the pictures but the actual pattern is not very elegant and looks like a cheaply painted one. I love correlle though!
4,Practical asthetically pleasing plates for everyday use,"Great price for these break resistant plates. Plates are made in the U.S.A. Wow!! Wish other companies would do this. Also, it is often reported that in China they often have substanard rules in manufacturing thus the lead in many of the toys produced there and contamination of some food products. Although the plates and bowls are made in the U.S.A. the coffee cups are manufactured in China. A negative!"
2,NOT AUTHENTIC,"Product arrived on time. But the only downside is that the markings of CORELLE is not original and clearly stated ""MADE IN CHINA"". I'm in Singapore, so I got no choice but to stick with the product."
5,Love my Corelle,"I've been using my Corelle for several months now. I love the clean, crisp blue floral pattern. I bought service for 12. There are some extremely minor manufacturing flaws (such as a tiny, tiny black mark on the bottom of a plate and a tiny, tiny bump on outer side of a bowl. But after years of using melamine plates, I'm very pleased with these lightweight, microwaveable, beautiful dishes. I would buy them again."
5,Good.,"This album feature Cannibal Corpse vocalist George""Corpsegrinder"" Fisher...The music is a lot like that ofCannibal Corpse. The newer music, not the old. The stand-out track is ""Dark Messiah"". Download it and you will see the similarities and differences of this and Cannibal Corpse. Definately would recommend purchasing for any death metal fan."
2,Wrong Color,"I didn't see the ""colors may vary"" blurb, and I definitely didn't know that one of the colors was pink. I received the pink one, which did not make me very happy. I'm returning this and buying one from an actual store."
2,Pink Bag - Color not in description,Received a Pink Bag for a boy...Color was not mentioned in description so I assumed it would match the picture. Called to return and customer service was very helpful with the return.
2,It's Pink Again!,"I am an older Female Nintendo DS Lite Game Player (Brain Age etc.) but I DON'T LIKE PINK! I wanted what was advertised a BLACK (which was shown) or a GRAY (which was also shown) Naki G-Pack Nintendo DS Lite case. My children talked me in buying the game(s) but at 50+ I feel a little silly walking around with a PINK case. I never liked PINK when I was 10 years old! The only good thing about it is it will STAND OUT IN A CROWD so I shouldn't lose it! But at 50+ I DON'T want to stand out with a PINK case that looks like a lunch box. Hey I'm a big girl! And the only other good thing about this is that I am a girl, I mean a woman. But I can't stand PINK!"
1,Another unhappy customer with a pink/white case,"Like several other customers, I purchased this for my son and received a white and pale pink case, rather than the black case pictured. It seems this is the only one Amazon is shipping lately, so buyer beware!"
2,Pink is not my color.,"This organizer arrived today...looks like it would hold my DSS and games just fine but it is lite pink, not black like the picture. I am returning it due to the color."
5,Great Bag,"Kids got these bags to go with their DS Lites and it is great. Shoulder strap helps them carry it, enough space for a ton of DS games as well as larger spots for the GBA games.

2,TD bangs out another soundtrack,"Tangerine Dream has got to be one of the busiest groups when it comes to releasing music. The problem is that quantity does NOT equal quality. The 1980s saw TD score a ton of movies, and judging by some of the titles, they sure didn't discriminate. TD's soundtrack output started wonderfully with Sorcerer (1977) and continued with great work on Thief (1981), The Keep (1983), and Firestarter (1984). Then it went pear-shaped, and they started banging out soundtracks like they were paying the rent. They went from scoring moderately big Hollywood movies that people had at least heard of to doing flicks like Dead Solid Perfect, Deadly Care, Catch Me If You Can(!) and Three O'Clock High. What happened? And this says nothing about the music itself."
3,For diehards,"TD kicked this album out several years ago during their soundtrack years. The cuts are much more in line with the late 80's sound of TD than the atmospheric electronic work previoius to that, or the up-tempo work of the 90's. The cuts are varied, but mostly short cues.Sylvester Levay (who cut teeth with Giorgio Moroder) adds a few TD sounding tracks to the mix."
3,"CUTE SET, BUT.........","This set needs a bit more stabilizer, as it just doesn't hold weight well at all~~When the child leans over in the chair, even slightly,the side just collapses;therefore ends up tipping over onto its side~~CHERYL A. MICHAUD"
2,Definately not the original!,"I'm surprised this was actually manufactured by KitchenAid, it's very thin and will be easily breakable, and the shape seems slightly off??"
3,thinner glass,"Compared to the original glass, this one is a light weight. I broke the original through being a klutz. This one could break without even being a klutz. The glass measures great and they have made the shape a bit oval. At $20 the markup is too high. Packaging was great."
4,"""Got an 8 cylinder motor and a jet-propelled overdrive""","I bought this one for the raw 'Buick '59' and sweet love song, 'The Letter'. I was surprised to find some other good tracks as well. Worth a listen!"
4,This book was very informative.,I enjoyed reading this book. However I noticed a number of errors. Since I paid $131 for this book I felt that I should have gotten a more accurate book.The content was very thorough. I felt that the author did a good job in explaining step by step how field oriented control theory works. Since I make my living selling Field oriented Control drives I find it very important to know as much about it as possible. This book was very informative.
