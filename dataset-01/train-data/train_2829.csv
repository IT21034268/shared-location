5,Wonderful,"I experimented with salmon flavor and chicken flavor. None of my four cats will touch salmon but gobble the chicken up quickly, pill and all with no hesitation. I do make sure if the pill is large I cut it in small pieces with one piece in each pocket. When I have more than one I drop the next piece right away so they don't take time to chew a lot. I also keep them in the frig so they will be fresher."
5,Love These!!!,These are a live saver! My vet's office recommended these when I asked about ways to give my cat her medication. I have a very finicky cat and it's very difficult to give her pills. She eats these with the pills in them like they are her regular food. I've tried both the salmon and chicken flavored. My cat has a strong preference for the salmon flavor. I highly recommend these!!
2,My cat wouldn't touch these but my dogs love them,After reading all of the positive reviews here I thought I'd give this a shot when one of my cats needed a course of antibiotic pills. She would not touch the pockets even without a pill in them. It may be because my cat routinely eats wet cat food so moist pellets like this are not so much a treat for her as they may be for cats that eat a dry diet. I had high hopes but this did not work for us - our dogs do like them though!
2,Cats won't touch them,I have 2 cats and neither would eat them without a pill in them. They are spoiled by the brand Temptations and don't like anything else for a treat. They only eat 9 lives dry and canned so i guess they are picky. I have bought every brand cheap and expensive and guess i'll give up.
4,Kitty loves them until they dry out.,These seem to be the only way I can get my kitty to take his daily pill. But I find that they tend to dry out pretty fast. I make sure all the air is out of the bag before sealing it and place it in a Ziploc. After all this they still seem to get dried out before we can finish the whole bag. My cat wont eat them once they start to get hard.
4,Worked for my cat,"I purchased these along with some tapeworm pills for my cat. He loves to eat treats so I had an optimistic view on this product working. I think you need to determine your cat type before you purchase these, some cats don't care for treats. However, I stuffed the pill in, closed it up, and put it before my cat and he chomped it down. I was nervous when he bit into it and figured here is where he tastes the icky pill and spits everything out. But NOPE! He ate all the bits! I gave him two empty pill pockets for being such a good boy. And he's worm free now. I hope these last awhile, because I only used 3 out of the whole bag."
5,Wow - so easy!,"Pilling my cat used to be awful. She hated being restrained and having something put in her mouth. She would struggle and often times spit it out, than run and hide. I would end up feeling so mean, dragging her out of her hiding place and trying again.I wasn't confident these pill pockets would work. My cat normally doesn't like treats. So, I put her medicine inside the salmon flavored pill pocket, then put it in a dish with a tablespoon of Fancy Feast salmon appetizer, which she loves, and spooned some of the juices over the pill pocket. She ate all of it very happily. Hooray!"
2,"Dusty, And It Reeks","They were out of Tidy Cats at the grocery store I shop at, so I picked up a 14 pound jug of this stuff, figuring that all the lower-priced scoopable cat litter brands were about the same. I was wrong.This litter puts out a lot of dust, and the ammonia smell was so bad that I went through the entire jug almost twice as fast as I do the Tidy Cats. It also does not clump as well as the Tidy Cats, which probably explains why cat urine odors are so free to travel.I do not recommend this product."
2,We Had to Break Up,"Gross. This litter doesn't clump hard and crumbles. When that happens, the ammonia odor escapes the clump, and the whole litter box instantly stinks. You get what you pay for."
3,Not flushable like the artwork shows,"This litter works fairly well, and it clumps fine. There is a bit of dustinvolved with this product, but not so much as to be a nuisance.This was supposed to be the flushable type litter, but I was shippednon-flushable. It had the same UPC, and the item # is the same.I don't know if this item is changing formula, but this litter is only worthwhile if it is the flushable type."
3,Romatic comedy,It was ok. The male strippers scenes should have been left out. otherwise it was an ok movie.
1,Uninteresting,"This movie did not capture my attention or keep my interest, ACTING WAS POOR, no real storyline, very unrealistic and unbelievable"
4,Good,"I liked this movie better than I thought I would. The plot was good and there was some pretty funny parts throughout. It was good seeing ""Flex"" again. I would recommend to a friend."
2,Not the 3 musketeers,"I have really appreciated Joel's recent books & had great expectations for this one also; however, I was greatly disappointed. To me heros are also honest, trustworthy, honorable people in everyday life. Do sorcerers & magicians automatically come along with dragons? For some reason I didn't think so. I prefer reading books without unnecessary ""language""."
3,OK for beginners,"When this book was written 14 years ago, it was much-needed, and I used it a number of times to help in my research of certain questions. However, in 2000, there are so many other books like this available today that are much more detailed and better organized. Several include When Skeptics Ask and When Critics Ask by Norman Geisler. Even McDowell's A Ready Defense is better than the Answers book. But if you are looking for a simple beginner's manual, then I suppose this could be very useful to you. It's small, inexpensive, and McDowell is very clear about his answers. For many, though, a good look through the apologetics section of Amazon or any Christian bookstore worth its salt will turn up better choices."
2,I'll be slightly more charitable than most skeptics.,"As a skeptic, I'm well aware that the arguments in this book are lame. But, to be slightly charitable, the book is about 20 years old, so I think it slightly unfair to judge it by modern standards.When I first read it, back when it was new, I didn't know anything about skeptical arguments. And so, at the time, I enjoyed the book. The author intended this book to be ""light"" and it is. And he has other books he intends to be scholarly (Evidence that Demands a Verdict) which really isn't, but gives the appearance of being so to the uninitiated. So, for what the author intended it to do, at the time he wrote it, I think it fit what he intended. It is of course complete garbage now, but I suppose for its era, I figure I should give it about 2 stars."
2,OK Book,"This book was just OK to me. A ""mini"" pocket book with questions that the author finds answers to in the Bible to fit his belief, not necessarily with anything else to back it up. Don't get me wrong, I'm a Christian, I love many of his other books but this one, unlike his others that give Biblical as well as scientific answers, this one skips the scientific back up.I'd pass on this one unless you can check it out of the library."
5,Perfect for New Believers,"I've checked every book I can get my hands on for a book that would answer the questions that almost every new Christian asks. None have the answers or even pose the questions that this book does. Most authors approach it from a theological perspective instead of looking at the evidence. He answers questions about where we get the Bible from, how can we know its accurate, what about apparent contradictions, what about the theory of evolution, all the answers that I had to come up with on my own, Josh presents in a succinct format. I'm getting 10 copies to give away to people that have decided to follow Jesus. The only criticism I have is for the last question which is out of place for this book."
4,a good book to start with,"This is a good book to start out with for someone who has never read any of this type of material before; it's in a Q&A format with answers to basic, tough, honest questions. For someone looking for more ""technical"" historical evidence, who has already read basic apologetics, I would recommend ""Evidence That Demands a Verdict"" over this one. As far as the claims that McDowell uses the bible to prove the bible: false. He first objectively establishes a case to believe in the bible, with reasoning apart from itself."
1,This may very well be the most stupid book ever published,"This book seems to have been written for an audience of five-year-olds. None of the ""answers"" McDowell presents make any sense whatsoever. He completely ignores any factors or evidence which would be against his point of view, and he basically makes up supporting material and presents it as certainity. Even deeply-believing Christians should be offended by this gross insult to our intelligence. This is true of everything this author writes. Josh McDowell is a moron. Ignore this book; spend your five bucks on a hamburger instead."
2,Songs for sleepers,"Got a bunch of slow stuff that didn't sell very well the first time out? Repackage it as ""Songs For Lovers"" and try again.If you tend to fall asleep after doing it, this is the album for you."
3,So much energy!,"Tarantula, Shake it fast, etc. These songs (clean version) will pump you up and get you going for that morning walk. I really like the beats!"
4,Good Investment,"I bought this book to complement a senior level financial accounting course that I took. The book is concise, provides plenty of examples, and helps to solidify theories & actual practices of financial accounting. There are plenty of exercises to go through to help solidify your practical understanding of the material. I found that it was particulary useful to help me review & brush up before my tests in my financial accounting course. Overall a good investment."
3,Poor Man's Casper Bizarre,"If you are a Donald G. Jackson fan, or just a fan of horribly bad-good movies, this movie is a definitely for you. Not much in the way of visual stimulation, aside from the baby ghost's horrible effects, but the drawn out dialogues (especially between the burglars) are laugh out loud funny, and bizarre. Probably not the best movie for a party, as the pacing is slow, but it is nonetheless very entertaining."
1,Acid Jazz ?,"Call it like it is...This would never PASS as Acid Jazz in ANY community of listeners. I'm sure that old school jazzheadz would agree w/ me.Like my father/great singer once told me...It's rare when someone covers a tune 'better' than the original artist. So, it's vital to apply their own signature. Sometimes that fails greatly, too."
4,A view into the first family of civil rights,I read this book a few yrs ago and can find a little of the truth behind the present day drama of the king family.I liked Dexter's explaination of the protection of his father's intellectual property and I can get a better perspective of Dexter the man from reading this book. Dexter uses undiagnosed ADD as a reason why he couldn't complete his studies at Morehouse and why he spent years moving from occupation to occupation from Atlanta cop to Project Manager to King Center president to Actor to King Center Chair to King Estate Chair...He gives us some insight on why has yet to marry.I came away with the view that it is tragic to allow yourself to coast off of your family's legacy without creating your own.
3,This is (kind of) the cartoon I remember...,"Bought this hoping it was the original animated Lorax cartoon I remembered from my youth, which it is - after a fashion. With this ""sing along"" format they've added some (useless) animated ""follow the bouncing ball"" type of lyrics at the bottom of the screen. It gets in the way more than anything. I wish they'd just left the cartoon as is!"
2,DON'T BUY IT IF YOU HAVE THE 2004 EDITION,THIS BOOK IS IDENTICAL TO THE 2004 EDITION AND HAS ABSOLUTELY NO UPDATED INFORMATION. IT HAS THE SAME STUDY GUIDE AND IDENTICAL SAMPLE TESTS. DON'T BUY IT IF YOU HAVE THE 2004 EDITION OF THE SAME BOOK!
4,A Way To Live,"Dr. Nassar gives a practical guide for living. It's a straight forward approach, using personal experiences, that shows how to deal with adversity through changing your perception of traumatic events from turmoil and crisis to acceptance and peace. It's a positive philosophy which negates the negativity which drives so many of us. Through this CD, you begin to realize that anything is possible when you empower yourself with the beliefs presented in Dr. Nassar's thoughtful presentation."
2,"If you're looking for a DJ mix, look elsewhere","I must say I'm dissapointed with this disc. I would hardly call it live, since I know Taucher mixes better than this. If you're looking for a well-mixed, great sounding disk, this isn't it. The tune selection is good, there are some standout progressive trance tunes with melodic synth lines. What concerns me is that the mixing is non-existant. Transitions between songs last about 5 seconds, maybe lining up for 16 beats total. This makes the cd somewhat jumpy, rather than a fluid set. I'm surprised that Taucher would put his name on this record."
5,My new Favortie Trancer,"Dj Taucher is Awsome, i never heard of him before, and i am into melodic Trance. Like Kimball Collins and such. I was looking for some new stuff, and came across this CD. Now Dj Taucher is my new favorite DJ. His Mixes go into smooth transitions and his song choices are awsome melodic hits. ANyone that likes melodic Trance Will Love this CD Garaunteed!.....Well back to the Club- Cya there"
3,"Good, but could be better","This is mainly melodic trance, with prominent keyboard/synth lines. It starts off slow but then progresses to faster beats. The mixing is not especially smooth, and while one song may be under 3 minutes long another one may take about 7 minutes. (I suppose it's all right for a live public performance, which this is.)My main complaint is that somehow I don't feel an energy rush when I listen to this CD. Also there is no track that really stands out to me, so these uplifting melodies all start sounding the same in the end.Note also that the quality of this recording is not as crisp as professional CD quality.Conclusion: very accessible melodic music on the ""easy-to-swallow"" side of trance, a bit slow in the beginning, and ultimately somehow lackluster."
4,Funk Has a Fever,"Tell Bootsy I'd like to write a album collaboration with HIM.Michael ""I.I. Inky"" LoveI meant the gang in San Antonio, Tx at the Mother Ship Tour along with the Brother Johnson's in 1976.We all ended up at the Crocket Hotel after the show.

2,missing something...,"I didnt actually buy this, but something occured to me as I read through the track list...how can you have a boy band compilation album featuring boy bands of the 90's...and not have a single Backstreet Boys song?"
3,Decent book,"Decent book, good photos, easy to carry to a nursery. It is designed like a ""dictionary"" of roses. I like it better when they are organized by rose catagory ( old roses, hybrid tea etc) but this is a nice book none the less."
5,Where's the party?,"I was saddened to read of Julius Wechter's passing last week.Wechter was the vibes player on Martin Denny's ""Quiet Village"", which was one of the most important songs of the lounge music revival of two years ago.In addition to his work with the Baja Marimba Band and Herb Alpert (marimbas on ""The Lonely Bull"", composer of ""Spanish Flea""), Wechter was the Musical Director (and vibist) of those great Chris Montez hits like ""Call Me"" and ""There Will Never Be Another You"".Whenever a new Baja Marimba album came out, I always searched the cover to find the fellow in the background inconspicuously going to the bathroom!"
4,unique sound from a unique band of the 60's,"This is a great collection of 25 songs from a unique band from the 1960's. Extremely light-hearted sound at times, the BMB presented Mexican flavored music at its finest. Fowl Play and Comin in the Back Door are highlights of this great collection."
4,Memories of the Baja Marimba Band,"As a high school student in the mid 1960's I was fortunate to see the Baja Marimba Band live ""in the round"" in Houston, Texas. Their rendition of ""The Look of Love"" gave me goose bumps. Still does today. It's a fine cd that I can associate with many fine memories."
4,"Sony BRAVIA KLVS32A10 32"" LCD WEGA review",So far so good. Very easy to quickly get familiar with the features.
1,Poor image quality,The image quality of this LCD is terrible in high def. No wonder its only $1599 and going down. Go with Plasma 37in or greater. Its worth the extra money.
3,Bible or Paperweight? I hope you are a mathematical guru!,"This text is more of a formula-reference with examples and is written for persons with substantial statistical / mathematical background. While I am sure that the text represents substantial value for those with substantial backgrounds in statistics / mathematics/ calculus, the rest of us may be somewhat less enlightened by the text. Make sure you have read over your Statistics 101, 102, 201, 202, 301, 302, 401, 402, 501, 502, Calculus 101, 102, 201, 202, and committed these texts to memory before reading this text. If you never met a formula you didn't like...this text is for you. The author does not hold your hand through the math and if you lack the background required, the book may have better use as a paperweight."
5,another wonderful art quilt book,A nice book to turn to when you want to learn this pretty technique. Best Sashiko book I've seen so far!
4,This is not a turkey. Read in front of log fire and smile.,"Stephen Nissenbaum has created a wonderful curio in ""The Battle for Christmas""and I found it well worth reading. If this subject peaks your interest, I suggest reading the extraordinary ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" by Richard G. Patton. Where Nissenbaum provides a scholarly encapsulation of the commercialisation of one of our favourite holidays, Patton depicts a spiritual giant untouched by orthodox doctrine. Both these books are hugely enjoyable though I think Patton's will fuel more dinner debates. Although comprehensive in it's coverage, the only thing it didn't tell me about, was what to do with all that left over turkey?! The Battle for Chistmas may appear cynical, but I'm sorry to say - I think it's a fairly reasonable represenation of market forces on an otherwise Pagan celebration."
4,Revealing look into Xmas,As a Christian I have recently come to realize that Christ was never in Christmas...the origins of this holiday are very pagan. This book reveals more truths about this holiday. Christians have been deceived and need to research...start with Saturnalia. Where in the Bible does God tell us to celebrate Jesus' birth? The early Christians did not celebrate it. Do some research. This book is interesting and I learned more truths about early American history and Santa. Worth reading.
3,Serviceable murder mystery.,"Tony Pratt, mystery novelist, gets roped into helping with a Japanese television Western and ends up with more than he bargained for.Nothing stands out about this book in either a good or a bad way-- there is enough humor and style to keep the reader going and enough mystery to make it an acceptable cozy. Do not expect the world from this book, and you will not be disappointed."
2,Not Region 1,"No opinion, since it's not in region 1, but it takes time to convert regions, I guess. I'm sure it's a great movie, once I get to view it. If I don't buy it somewhere else and it goes to Region 1, I'll give another review."
2,Unless you're Scottish-YOI!,"Aside from the difficulty in understanding the Scottish dialogue, and what turns out to be a slightly forgettable, muddled plot, the performances are what carry this movie forward. Jonny Lee Miller, as always, is incredible. Though he's lost some of his thin faced freshness, he still has an appeal that remains universal. He and his co-stars do an admirable job with less than great material, but in the end (and at the end) what good's a movie unless you're kept interested. An unexpected, fairly dumb ending. 2 outta 5."
1,No upclose view,"This sweatshirt turned out to have some ugly stitching under the back of the hood. It's cute, for a girl but i guess thats why it was so cheap."
4,Overlooked 80's Metal band,"I caught Seduce on the documentary ""The Decline of Western Civilization Part 2, The Metal years"". Seduce is a power trio from Detroit with a sound that is all thier own. When I first heard Seduce I was struck by thier bottom end guitar sound which is tuned down to a D. Add Mark Andrew's barley audible vocals in and you will find yourself listening to this disk over and over. The songs are well written and capture the bands energy. Too Much Ain't enough still holds up, Give this disk a try....you might be pleasently suprised."
4,heaviest LA glam band ever heard,"these guys looked glam proably lived there too but they took thing to another level.they were rough&crude like GnR and had a touch of Crue (wildside,kickstrat my heart&shout)but i think they might have seen megadeth play once because they had some fuel injected riffs too."
1,useless tripe,"This video is nothing but an extremely boring review of what happens at this school. It could help you decide whether to go to the school or not, but it won't give you any information specific to finding and hooking bonefish. There are long stretches of pointless information, including some abstruse details about graphite rod construction. If you already know how to cast a fly, you won't learn how to catch bonefish, and you wouldn't learn what you needed to know if you were a beginner either. At the end, where they actually go fishing, they catch permit, a different species entirely. If you want to know how to catch bonefish, don't waste your money."
3,Good but....,Ordered it for a trip to Yosemite. This National Park not listed..hmmmm.. strange. Looks good for a lot of other parks. Next time I'll stick with Woodall's directories.
2,It 's not a complete guide,The material is important...Forest service campgrounds are great places to camp. But the Coleman guide is hard to use. There is not a good map to be found in it...(and these are the same folks who are publising the DeLorme Atlas?) You can get a feeling for the camping if you have a separate map and flip around in the directory from alphabetical listings tht aren't all in close proximity. It WILL work for you if you have the individual national forest maps that the forest service publishes!
4,Great Resource,"Finally, a book that has all the National Grasslands and the Army Corp of Engr. sites in it as well as the Forest areas! Another nice feature of the book was that it listed some regional campgrounds as well if they were in the area of the Nat'l campgrounds.There were a couple of items that could be corrected: 1.On page 314 #'s 264,265,&270 were written about on page 637 under Tennessee (because they are in Tennessee). 2. On page 623 #36 is on Map page 50 rather than 44 and not near Los Angeles but muchfurther northwest than where it is indicated if it truly is in the Visalia area.Not to be picky, because I really like the book and find it a valuable resource but the color brown used in the numbering on the maps is a little difficult to read at dusk or later. And it seems like a lot of times we look for campgrounds late in the day."
5,Coleman National Forest Campground book,"I love it. Very informative, beautifully printed, easy to use."
3,It`s ok,It`s ok. It is an older book lots of information I have read that the newer book is a lot better. I should have spent ihe extra bucks for a new one!
5,Shine 10 shines like platinum,"This is a very good album for any indie music fan, i bought when it just came out a few years ago, so its got sum classic tunes, but i believe its a must own album. i just started playing it again a few weeks ago and it got me hooked again, possibly a nostalgia trip. but hey. BUY IT NOW. 11 OUT OF 10. (OR 6 AMAZON STARS)"
2,Where are the ghosts?,I think this was a genuine exhibit of a groups search for the Supernatural - but again mostly based on what a medium has to say rather than real evidence. There were a few of the group who really made sense but the DVD fell short of producing anything other than what came out of the mind of a human being who probably researched the sites before he did the investigation. Please don't misunderstand - I do believe mediums have there place but this DVD relied too much on his observations with nothing to prove what he was seeing in his mind. Again too much attention to orb activity even with one member stating she could see a face in one of the orbs - give me a break - she needs to do her homework. Another don't waste your money. This two DVD set even has a segment of wathcing and listening to juvenile banter between members of this group which were not funny and truly unprofessional - I would 't want them investigating any paranormal activity for me or my friends.
3,"Anthony Steffen, Italy's Clint Eastwood","..in this case Anthony Steffen is the ""Gentleman Killer"". A film to be liked or disliked, depending on the individual watching. There is a good plot for the slaying of Steffen's brother, a good music score, directed by Ennio Morricone, plenty of gunplay and action...not so great video transfer, ""letterbox version"", - not 16x9 widescreen, and the fighting and shooting choreography seems to lack good direction. This spaghetti does have some western extraordinary, ""classic"" moments, making the film for collectors worth the price of admission, rating it 3 stars for the not so good Wild East video transfer and the thin letterbox version."
5,john b,"just recently purchased this dvd by WILD EAST PRODUCTIONS,and ihave got to say,they did a fantastic job on restoration andsound of this movie,plus the extras thrown in.And an interviewwith anthony steffen,the star of GENTLEMAN KILLER.No it's notSERGIO LEONE or SERGIO CORBUCCI.But GIORGIO STEGANI Did asuperb job of this.the story is good,the action is good as wellwith a couple of fine fimiliar faces of 1 or 2 character actors.This ""SW"" is a must see.I'm not going to ruin it by tellingyou what happens.Just check it out for your self if you lovethe ITALIAN WESTERNS LIKE I DO.ALSO,ENNIO MORRICONE AND BRUNONICOLAI DOES THE SCORE AS WELL.GREAT SCORE FOR THIS MOVIE."
2,Things Fall Off,"I really liked these at first. They are the right height and the peak out daintly over several long dresses. They even added interest the day I wore them with jeans. But then it started to unravel, the rhinestones which add much glam started to fall off. So yes if you are looking for something to wear over say the holiday period and this is all the 'wear life' you want. No if you want for beyond one season."
5,Powerful Water Crystal Cards,"Wonderful! I love how you can use these cards to fill a room with a specific energy, or you can rest your glass of water atop one to have that chosen energy to be transferred to your water as part of your healing. It's a great gift for anyone; even someone who doesn't yet know about Dr. Emoto's work will appreciate them for their beauty!"
1,"""From"" Palaestra and ""Authored by"" Ranny Levy?","Ranny Levy copies/pastes movie reviews from Kids First and written by teenagers, and posts them as her own. Is this book any different? I am not spending $5.95 for 5 pages to find out, but I suspect it's more plagiarism and would not recommend it to anyone valuing their money."
1,Camo capri,"There is no way the size I rec'd was 'WOMENS' sizes (and I went up one size when I ordered it). Also when I gave a poor rating this was the email I rec'd: ""Our feedback page ideally is to rate the transaction you had with us, not per say to rate the product you received.

1,what?....,Delivered on time but it takes some assemble that is very confusing.if u do not know much about that stuff you will be lost. Also does not come with the receiver so if u set it up.....its just a beam.....expensive beam. Mine are still in the box and ive had them since september.i wouldnt get it.
4,Lose weight by tuning your mind and behavior,"The secret to losing weight is creating a program that you can stick with. This books reveals all of the things that you must do in order to lose weight and keep it off for life, most importantly of which is the ability to tune your mind to succeed.Victoria includes several ideas that you can incorporate into your own unique program.Read this book and highlight all of the ideas and solutions that you can use and refer back to the book as often as possible. I keep a copy of this book in my car and I read from it daily."
4,Huguette's review,Really enjoyed this book. It pertaines not only to loosing weight but a positive attitude to meet any chalenge we meet in our daily life.
2,short stories and subjects...,"The book was interesting and had some nice essays. I agree with some of the other reviews that it is little more than articles we ahve all read before, tied together to create this book. The author also states that she was once overweight....I have searched for her before and afters, even on her site and can't find any....does anyone know where I can see what she looked like ""before""? I just love before/after stories, I can relate to them more than a person who doesn't understand what it is like to be fat. thanks"
5,Worked for me,Worked well on my 2004 Subaru Forester XS. Easy install was done in about 10 minutes and the fit was perfect.
3,Good information - Very poorly printed,"As an original copy is seldom available, this bad reprint provides the best source for this data in one book. WARNING - have your reading glasses ready - this edition is a poorly scanned copy of the original - most type is readable, but blurry. Pictures have too much contrast and lack detail. Line diagrams have fine lines and small type faded away.Even with these faults, there is still a wealth of data to make this a keeper"
5,Refreshing New Look Into The Mexican/American War,"Mr. Thom's novel, Saint Patrick's Battalion, ia a refreshing new look into the U.S. invasion of Mexico in 1846. Through Mr. Thom's description of the men (mostly Irish Catholics) who comprised the St. Patrick's Battalion, we are provided with a realistic account of the invasion itself and of the noble reasons that scores of Irish-born U.S. Soldiers switched sides and joined the Mexican Army to defend a weaker, Catholic nation. And they did it willingly and with the knowledge that they would face the gallows if American forces should defeat the Mexican Army, which of course they did. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever questioned the ""manifest destiny"" philosohpy that was used to justify the war against Mexico."
5,St. Patricks Battallion,"As usual, Mr. Thom has written an exciting tale of the Mexican/ American war.I couldn't put this book down!"
1,"America is bad! Bad, Bad, Bad!!!","Having read all of Thom's novels I am increasingly disappointed at his slide into sterotypical, revisionist story telling. Reading Mr Thom's novels starting with From Sea to Shining Sea, where Americans are brave, noble frontier folk you can follow the descent of the pioneers to brutish, amoral thugs interested only in killing as many indians as possible while stealing their land. Native Americans however become ever more noble and without blemish as persecution by the evil whites increases.Even taking into account the realities of frontier history, such simplistic stereotyping (Indian=good, Whiteman=bad) ruins what were once enjoyable novels of America's early years transforming them into just more ""Evil American"" trash. If that was not enough, now we're stealing land from the Mexicans and persecuting the Irish Roman Catholics.This is the last time Thom suckers me out of the price of a book."
4,Want to keep the Christmas Spirit thoughout the year?,Dave has assembled a nice variety of Chistmas favorites. If you enjoy listening to Dave's truck driving songs you will enjoy this CD as part of your Chritmas festivities as well as throughout the year.
2,A bit disappointing,"My first read of a Jon Jackson novel, and after reading the reviews on here I had higher hopes than the book delivered. At times it was very good, well paced, clear characters and action and then it would wander of on some side road for a period of time. Given that the Detroit detective's name is featured on the cover, I kept wondering when he would appear. Well, not for quite a while and then the most interesting aspect of his life is his living arrangement with his ladlady. I believe this needed more re-writing than it got."
1,Not my way,"UHH! So disappointing. Track#9 is why I bought this album. A perfect house song, sexy-streetstyle. I had to have it right away. But the rest of the album is 60's style Cuban jazz...and while I could be cool with that, there is not one more quality track on the album. Nothing passionate or progressive. Just one great house song. If you're looking for good music, look elsewhere."
5,You'll Be Blown Away!!,"I thought Rob Halverson's first album was a brilliant piece of work indeed. Now I've heard ""Second Whirled"" and I have to admit I now have a new favourite!!Besides the absolutely gorgeous arrangements, he has somehow gotten even ""gritty-er"" than on the first Cd. Some of the songs sound like Lenny Bruce in a nightclub. One sounds like a Barry White song, low voice and everything!!Can't say enough about the songs. This group goes straight to the heart of me. This Cd is great!"
5,Good running watch,"I recently bought this watch and have been very happy with it as my running watch. I have had similar models in the past. It is easy to use and has all the right features. The pink is a little much (bright), but I think it is kind of fun."
3,Interesante,"La accion de esta novela transcurre en Nueva York. Brad Rowan, directivo de una empresa de relaciones publicas, precisa obtener un contrato con un poderoso magnate del acero, Matt Brady. Mientras se halla ocupado en su ultimo proyecto, Brad recibe una peticion por parte de su amigo: ayudar a una dama de la alta sociedad neoyorkina, quien piensa efectuar una campaña contra la poliomielitis. La mujer, Elaine Schuyler, perdio años atras a su marido y a sus dos hijos, victimas todos ellos de tal enfermedad. A pesar de ser hombre casado, Brad no tarda en enamorarse de Elaine, quien le corresponde. Casualmente, Elaine es sobrina de Brady. El magnate, enterado de las relaciones extramatrimoniales de Brad, le ofrece un ventajoso contrato a cambio de interrumpir el adulterio. Una novela interesante con un final para refleccionar."
3,a good semi sim text book,"This is a very good book for learning semiconductor device simulations and concepts of general PDE solving. Though it did not include the latest techniques or cover various methods, it can be used a starting textbook on the subject."
2,"Skimpy ,not worth it","There are two problems with this purchase: One is that when I attempted to order large size, it continually came up as SL. The product that was shipped to me was XL, but surprisingly they do not fit as such. They are cut far too skimpy. There is no freedom of movement with these. I am wearing a pair as I write, but I doubt very much if I will use them. It will cost me more to send them back than the transaction is worth so I will probably donate them to a shelter or something. Very disappointed."
5,I love this video,"This video I bought on line and it has all 3 workouts on the same video. It is a great motivator and it's nice to see the success that the actual WW members have had on the WW program. It took me awhile to get to level 3, but it's worth it. When I can't get to the gym and too cold to walk outside, it is the greatest thing to put the video on and just move! You can even add more moves to the video if it's not challenging enough by raising your arms, using heavier weights or putting more bounce into your workout.It makes you feel very virtuous when you can finish 2 of them without a problem."
3,Not instructed clearly enough,"I bought this DVD to try to get started on the right track to weight loss. However, I found it hard to follow. The instructor had already changed her move before she instructs the viewer to do so. Then it is hard to catch up with the right rhythm when you are two beats behind. She keeps counting before you get a chance to change. Maybe if you do it every day and memorize the routine, you could be able to do it without screwing up and getting behind, but for beginners its not all that great.I find the ""Crunch"" fitness DVD's to be the best as far as instruction goes. They tell you which side to start on, left or right, and how many counts you will do before you even start counting. I think I'll list this DVD back on amazon.com for sale since its not working out for me."
5,Still using this video years later,"I bought this video in my earlier Weight Watcher days a few years back and I still love it. I got away from it for a while (about a year), but am back using it at least once a week for the last month or so (I alternate with other videos and jogging). There are 3 easy to follow videos that are 3 different intensity levels. All use free weights - whatever works for you - or no weights if you're really a beginner. The 3rd workout (Get Fit) is what I use most - it never gets boring, just up the weight and it's suddenly a challenge again. I love that the workouts are with actual WW members - at least mostly WW members - I'm a little leery about the blonde in the back :)What I really love is that they tell you the activity points values unlike the newer videos they have put out. I would recommend it to anyone who can still find this video to get it."
3,Get in shape,It was okay. I only did it once. I would like to have more of the same routine and not so much jumping from one routine to the next. I am going to try it again to see if i like it a little better.
1,Pressit very BAD,"Save your self [some money]. This is one of the worst java aps I have used. Also you can not get blank labels in the US. I called the US distrbutor listed on the box. They told me they no longer suport Pressit. They sugested I call Momorex as they where now handling it. Called there and they where clueless. So what do you get for your [money]. A few sample labels, a nice applicator to put them on and a realy poorly writen java program. Not intuitive or user friendly and very slow and this was on a new 17""PB 1ghz. Mac. You would be better off to just down loading their free templates for photoshop. Oh I emailed the company twice in the UK no resonce after 2 weeks. Oh well, let the buyer beware..."
1,Software doesn't work,"The program just hangs constantly. It hangs when you try and save. It hangs when you try and print. The only thing I've been able to get it to print is a simple label with plain text. If you add an image or try and use any effects on the text then the program hangs. And its slow.As a programmer, I understand that programs have bugs. The problem is this company has never released an update in three years. Never! This means the chances of any of these bugs being fixed is nill. Save your money and use something else. Anything else!"
1,dont order,"Im reviewing the service of Amazon. I placed this order not realizing it was an audio cd. The order wasnt even placed for 10 minutes when i tried to cancel it. Its being shipped anyway,after 3 e-mails within a few minutes. There customer service really sucks."
3,"Good music, problematic sound quality","The 1st half of this album is from a 1975 session with 5 guitarists playing unison lines,""Tony Rizzi's Five Guitars Play Charlie Christian"".It features 8 standards (with cutesy renamed titles) made famous by Benny Goodman's band with Charlie Christian, and is technically excellent, but could prove a bit much for a casual listener.For guitar nuts only - The 2nd half is taken from a 10"" record circa 1953. While the music on this portion is fine and even very lovely early 50's jazz, buyer beware! The sound is very bad.I am a huge fan of 50's jazz, but the surface noise on these sides is intolerable.If you want 50's guitar, I recommend you try Jimmy Raney, Mundell Lowe, Johnny Smith, Tal Farlowe Kenny Burrell etc.Not to knock Tony Rizzi in the least, he is superb.It's just too bad they couldn't find a cleaner source for the 1953 sessions."
3,Not what I expected,"If you are as familiar with the songs from the Bugaloos TV series as I am, you may be somewhat disappointed with this CD. The versions of the songs are not the same as on the episodes. There is different production, instrumentation, and mixing, including on the vocal tracks. While the essence of the songs is the same (and I do enjoy them), I would have preferred to have a CD with the songs as they were heard on the show."
3,collectors only,"A steep import price and a playing time of less than 30 minutes makes this a real indulgence. This is fluffy, anodyne pop that's really only listenable in short bursts (about the length of this release,actually) by kitsch aficionados, so if you fit the bill, spend away. The sound quality is pretty good (apparently remastered), but there's practically no further information or exclusives apart from Japanese liner notes."
4,"Surprisingly solid, for an acquired taste!","Yes, budget packaging contrasts with the import price. However, one gets their money's worth with this reissue. With arrangements by Al Capps (think Bobby Sherman's hits....it even sounds like some of the same session players backing the quartet) and the vocals of four unknowns (separately or harmonizing as a group), it all gels. Good sound quality, though VERY minor problems are audible; this would be due to the tape's condition, and not the remastering. The feeling of these tracks falls somewhere between the recordings of the Monkees and the Archies, and to good effect. If only bonus tracks featuring music from the show that didn't make it to record were included (even if they had to be dubbed from the original video masters), this set would be perfect! Anyway, it's a good buy, no matter how long it runs. More enduring than Jack Wild and a talking flute (that looks like a pretzel rod)! All the best, Brother Fang."
4,Not Hanna Barbara,"It was actually a Sid and Marty Kroft show that's why there were british actors. Kroft also did Lidsville, HR Pufnstuf, Land of the Lost, Sigmund the Sea Monsters and many other shows that varied in an hour and 1/2 format each show running about 1/2 hour per episode. The US CD is being released March 14, 2006 at a much cheaper rate. Same songs less than 1/2 the cost. Is it as good as the import? I don't know, but it is worth a listen."
5,Drakes Funny Bones,"Well, it worked out great because they were bought for a friend who now resides in California but is originally from New York.They arrived in a timely fashion and they were in good condition and enjoyed by all.In fact I would order them again.."
2,Drakes Funny Bones,When the package arrived the expiration date had already passed by one week & the Funny Bones were smashed. So needless to say they were already dry & inedible. A waste of my money!
4,Always A Solid Performer,"First of all, I must start with the fact that Funny Bones have a lower melting point than Helium. You breath near them and they basically start to liquify. Anyway, onto the review...Drake's Funny Bones consistantly deliver a product that I am very happy to put in my mouth. The peanut butter-chocolate combination is executed with style and dignity, and this snack is fabulous. The end."
1,Football games are the worst!!,I think football games are the worst kind of games ever! Why would anyone want to sit and play a electtronical football game.I mean football is only fun in real life dont get this game
5,The Best Madden game,"This game is great, period. I love the QB Vision, Hit Stick, Truck Stick, Superstar Mode, and the list goes on and on. The graphics are outstanding, and the little extra things they put in there are terrific. (I love seeing the lineman argue with the ref over if the ball carrier got over the first down line!) Overall, I love this game and almost play it daily. A truly great football game.GO FALCONS!"
5,Class reward,I purchased this as an end of week reward for my students. It kept them busy for the 40 minute period. They can't wait to earn it again. Perfect! [for the moment]
2,Stability and Service Problems,"Overall the laptop works fine but after several months of use it started powering off randomly. I suspect this is due to the fact that the laptop gets extremely hot when in use. It took four calls to HP support to actually get a service ticket logged (each agent said they were doing this but never did). I finally was able to ship the unit to HP for repair, three weeks after logging the first service call I receive a still broken laptop back from HP. They where suppose to replace the hard drive and motherboard, instead the service notes say they reloaded the OS? The hard drive still fails diagnostics and it has no OS loaded on it? I think with their new found popularity HP is having big problems keeping the customer service side up to an acceptable level. You may want to look at another vendor."
3,Haven't Notice Much Difference,"The heading says it all, and I've used the product for about 3 weeks. From the research I did, this seems like a really quality product but it is not for me, although it probably did me some good in a subtle, undetectable way. Will obviously not purchase again."
2,not what it is,does not plug into any connector on 96 explorer with JBL audio system as described i still had to hard wire the speakers in
1,Mucinex Made me 100 Times Sicker Than My Sickness,"Yes, it sure did relieve me of my cough very fast.Then came chronic diarrhea for about 6 hours.Chronic disorientation and nausea.Extreme loss of appetite.Hot and cold sweats randomly despite being in a well air conditioned room.And worst of all, I took 1 single pill at 2:30 pm yesterday, and I have not slept all night long. This pill was taken about 30 hours ago as I typed this and I am still feeling the insomnia, disorientation and lightheadedness.STAY AWAY. I have no idea when I will finally get to sleep and get the rest to end this nightmare."
1,No effect,"I have tried this a couple of times in the past year with absolutely no effect. I coughed just as much with it as without, and had no more productive coughing than I did without it. So neither the expectorant nor the cough suppressant seem to work. I didn't experience any side effects either, as some reviews have noted. My current cough is the result of recovering from thyroid surgery and a respiratory infection that has been quelled with antibiotics. Now I have a lingering cough."
2,check the date,"I could not argue the price, but the medication's expiration date was just months away. But I was desperate, so I can't complain. And it still worked well even after the use by date."
1,Sorry but the order is not here yet!!!,I have not received my order! I hope I get it. We use it every day. The last time I had a order mix-up it took almost a month to get my correct order. This time I didn't even get a wrong order!
1,Gave me major diarrhea,"Gave me diarrhea so bad I couldn't even keep water in me. Kept me up all night going to bathroom. It did help with the congestion and cough, but not worth the side effect. I tried taking it for 2 days but had to quit."
1,Too Strong! stick with Robitussen DM!,"I've been taking Robitussen DM as per ER doc for Viral Bronchitis along with Albuterol inhaler & antibiotics... slow but steady progress in recovering... decided to give Mucinex DM a try instead of the Robitussen DM, thinking it would help me better thru night hours... Big Mistake!I have had disorientation, joint aches, nausea, waves of flushing & heat flashes, for over 15 hours since I took 1 tablet of the Mucinex DM ... Strongly recommend you consult with a doctor before substituting this for Robitussen DM or trying this for any reason.I do not recommend Mucinex DM for anyone without doctor's approval... I'm not even sure this should be OTC!"
4,MucinexDM,"The Mucinex DM I ordered was OK. It did not help my sinus problem, which stops up my nose when I sleep. My daughter told me I should have ordered MucinexD."
2,"My pharmacist says ""no""","I intended to order mucinex alone but opened the package before seeing my mistake. So I asked my pharmacist if the additional ingredient was OK. He said the two ingredients fight each other, so that the combination makes no sense."
1,This drug should be removed from the market,"I took Mucinex DM, 1 pill and then another dose as perscribed and it does what it says. It relieved my mucuos congestion. However, it also made me dizzy, plummeted my blood-pressure down, made me break out in cold sweats, gave me insomnia, wiped me out and was as if I had taken some form of LSD (not that I've ever tried that). I'm astonished that this product is sold over the counter, let alone be allowed in the hands of comsumers outside the confines of a hospital."
1,Severe hive reaction,"I would caution you about taking this medication. My sixteen year old son is not highly allergic to products, but had a severe hive reaction after taking two tablets. I called the 800 number on the bottle and they instructed us to go to the emergency room since he had hives over most of his body. I'm not looking forward to getting the bill since I don't have insurance that will cover it. Even after giving him three medications while he was in the hospital, it still took four days for the hives to go away entirely."
1,Does nothing for me. Try hot tea with honey instead.,"Well, I bought the product based on mostly positive reviews. Unfortunately, I must be among the 50% or so of people for whom Mucinex has no effect whatsoever. Took the pill at 8:30 PM. By 1:30 AM still awake and coughing. Altogether I've tried the following products:Mucinex DM. Result: no effect on cough or production of phlegm.Pseudophed. Result: no effect on cough or production of phlegm. Sleepless night with high pulse (pseudophed is a stimulant like caffeine).Cough-drops (active ingredient Menthol): taste good, but no effect whatsoever.The only thing that works (a little bit) is hot tea with honey. Allows me to sleep. Check out the articles on cough at webmd.com - they'll tell you that cough medicines aren't worth the paper they're packaged in."
1,made cough worse,"I have taken 3 doses of Mucinex DNA (36 hours). It absolutely has made my cough worse and not ""productive"". I don't feel the suppressant side of this medication at all. Never again"
2,Value missing,"The product is great, but the price/value relationship is not. The same product but 2x the dosage is available at a much less per pill cost. Other products purchased on Amazon have far greater value and don't disappoint like this one did/Mucinex DM Extended-Release Bi-Layer Tablets, 40 Count"
5,Very strong compared to cough syrup,"My wife suggested Mucinex after I developed a post-flu cough that kept me up at night. This stuff allowed me to sleep. Then I ran out of it and went to the store to get some more, but it is expensive, so I bought some cough syrup instead with the same active ingredients--dextromethorphan and guaifenesin. Well, I just compared the potency of the Mucinex with the cough syrup. 12-hour Mucinex has 60mg dextromethorphan and 1200 mg guaifenesin per tablet; the 4-hour cough syrup only has 10mg dextromethorphan and 100 mg guaifenesin per 2 tsp dose. In other words, the Mucinex has six times the dextromethorphan and 12 times the guaifenesin as the cough syrup. Even adjusting for the time difference (12 hours for Mucinex and 4 hours for the cough syrup), the Mucinex is much more powerful. No wonder it works. I don't know how they get away with packing such a punch in the Mucinex."
1,Caused bad reaction,"After taking this I was up for three hours with a hard heart beat, hot/cold flashes. Hallucinations, gas, chest pain, diarrhea this lasted for over 24 hours an i only took one pill. I am 5'7 and 240 I thought I was having a heart attack."
4,Surprise!,"There actually is a plot. Julie comes from a much smaller town to a still-pretty-sleepy local newspaper. She splits amicably from her friend/boyfriend, makes some new friends, and nails everything in sight. From a fellow reporter with interesting ideas on delayed gratification, to a earnest young cop who is trying to be domineering, to the motercylcle-riding, philosophy-reading bad boy, Jon, to the fierce Monica. The characters in this book are pretty developed, the setting is more than backdrop, both the town and the news office seem real, and the background mystery plot stays within grasp, no matter what other hanky-panky is going on. Julie is unapologetic about her sexuality, and despite the variety and frequency of her encounters, it never seems truely gratuitous. This is a well-written keeper."
3,"close, but not quite!!","Even when said is compatible with 2003 and up F150, did not fit in mine, the plug is too big."
3,Needed a better discription,"This harness mates well with the male half, therefore five stars. Just be warned that there are not enough leads to connect to the factory harness, therefore minus two stars. I noticed right away that there were several wires not included on this harness when compared to a factory Male. The wiring schedule that came with the harness had a little to be desired. It took me some time to figure out the wiring color description and what was function of each wire. I mainly held the two next to each other and tried to line up the pins.Bottom line, it worked for the most part but I now do not have the use of my on steering wheel volume, media selector, and tune buttons. In my opinion, this would work just fine in any situation other than mine, where I have steering wheel controls. Knowing better, I installed anyway because I wanted to get the radio back in. I will be changing it out asap."
3,Missing Wire for Pin 19 to Steering Wheel (-),"I bought this adapter to go with my Ford Focus and the Pioneer AVH-P2400BT. I also purchased the Metra Axxess ASWC Steering Wheel Control Interface. The Metra wiring harness was very easy to coordinate with the aftermarket radio harness, and instllation was a sinch. My main gripe with this harness is that it was missing the wire going to pin 19. The steering wheel controls on the Ford Focus use pin 18 (SWC +) and pin 19 (SWC -). Pin 19 needs to be grounded (i.e. connected to the negative terminal of the battery). This would have been simple, had the wire been provided. But since the wire wasn't provided to pin 19, I had to cut the OEM harness to ground the wire at Pin 19, ultimately defeating the purpose of the Metra Harness.Overall this product fits is purpose, but if you are looking to keep your steering wheel controls functional go with the Scosche instead."
3,Missing a wire for Lincoln LS,"The harness was fine except there was a missing pin/wire for one of the signals coming from the dash connector in my 2005 Lincoln LS. There were a few pins/wires in the harness that were not needed, however with this connector design it is not possible to remove a pin to move it to another pin position without a specialized tool. The only solution was to cut and splice the wire in my dash directly to the new radio. This harness should be packaged with at least one spare pin/wire not already placed in the connector shell so that customers will be able to insert it into one of the empty pin positions if needed."
5,Worth 10x the price,"Plug and play for a 2008 Ford F150, saved having to butcher the factory wiring harness and made the new stereo install trivially easy. Can't recommend highly enough!"
1,Very Poor Reliability,"Purhased this TV on 12/06. TV stopped working 4/07. How good can a TV be if it stops working 120 days (approx.) after it is purchased?? The picture quality is great, the sound is very good, but it breaks down virtually immediately! And getting it serviced is another nightmare. I do not know about Sony products in general, but if this is an example of them, any prudent person will stay away from Sony."
3,Pedantically poor.,"This John Stillwell character clearly knows what he is doing; however, this does not help those who are neophytes to abstract algebra. The main text generally has nothing to do with the examples which have nothing to do with the exercises which have nothing to do with the main text. An excellent tool - for those already familiar with the area."
4,Loved his writing style!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I listened to it on CD, and the talented narrator was one of the best I've listened to--He definitely added to my overall enjoyment. I found myself laughing out loud at some points, and sitting on the edge of my seat in others. I really liked the protagonist, David, who, depsite his success, seemed to be a genuine, nice guy. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because I was not at all surprised by the twist; I had assumed it right away. How's that for being vague so as to not give away the climax? Overall, I would highly recommend this book. This was the first book I've read by Howard Rougham, which, apparently was his second. I am now going to read his first book."
3,Yes and No,"This book was so exciting in kind of a simple way, certainly not a difficult read, with nice twists. I was anxious to keep reading it each day, and then anxious to finish it, but then the end left me sort of disappointed. It was a fun ride, though."
5,The Promise of a Lie,One of the best mysteries I have read in a long time. I read it in one day. Where has this author been hiding? Write more soon. Highly recommend. lalagee
5,"Superb, as always","This concert contains the expected excellence with the singing talents of Mr. Ball. The best part of the concert is the anatomy of a love affair through song, incorporating the acting and vocal talents of this gifted man."
5,great as always,What a wonderful voice and great perfomer. I have all of his DVDs and all of his CDs (most of which I had to order from England. Great that some of them you can not get from Amazon. Hope they start to carry all of his. Michael Ball has one of the best male voices around and he puts on a long and great concert. Well worth every $$ you spend.
2,limited use,"This is handy to keep in the car to transport hot or cold items short distances. However the top doesn't seal tightly, so in many cases a cooler is a better option."
5,"So simple, so true and definitely funny!","Got it from a friend before my first son was born. What a blast I had going through the book, looking at my wife and recognizing the ""symptoms"" described in the book, my own reactions and the simple fact that not only a child was about to be born, but also ourselves, as parents,Go for it, nice buy, wonderful gift."
2,This is NOT American Idol Casey James!,Not his voice and not his band. He is the band with his bro and Mom Bybee Debra James which he sang on 1 track on her CD. It is availabe on MP3.
4,Julie,"A novel of how Julie, a young Eskimo woman, wishes to live by the old Eskimo ways, but the world is changing. What Julie hated the most, was, the Minnesota law wolf to kill live stock, is a wolf to be killed ""She must try to lead her wolfs to safety...or her family back to the old ways"
5,"In her father's eye's she's Miyax, but in others she's Julie","WONDERFUL!!!!!!! You will fall in love with this book, it's got adventure, romance, laughter, and culture! This is not a short book, and I read it in three days!! If that doesn't show you how you get pulled into it, I don't know what does. I think you should absolutely read it!!!!!!!!!a 12 year old in the USA"
5,Julie,"This one, in my opinion, is a bit better than the first one. Since this one has more social interaction, it makes time seem to fly by much quicker. It also contains the same friendly wolves, which also makes it exciting for anyone who read Julie of the Wolves."
5,Amazing Sequel!,"This book is very amazing, it is just as good as it's original, 'Julie of the wolves'. I really loved reading this book, and I'm sure you'll love it too, if you love animals. Don't waste your time on another 'tundra imitation' book, get Julie of the wolves, Julie, and Julie's wolf pack now!"
4,Julie,"Julie tries to deliver a baby calf in the Arctic. Her stepmother Ellen helps her. While they were delivering the calf a huge storm kicked in. It was so bad that the temperature dropped to thirty below zero. Ice pellets came pouring down as big as hockey pucks. Julie and Ellen try to build a wall of ice blocks around them to keep out the strong, howling wind. Will they finish the wall before the wind gets too cold or too strong? Will they die, or will they survive in this harsh storm? To find out, read ""Julie"" the sequel of ""Julie of the Wolves"" by Jean Craighead George."
3,GOOD and BAD,"This is a textbook for study in preparation for testing. There are sample test questions at the end of each chapter and a sample general test at the back of the book. That's good; however, there were no answers to the questions. . . . that's bad. Where were they? Were there ever any answers so one could check to see if they understood the answers to be correct ? OR, is it a guessing game with a price tag ?"
3,Not Explicit Lyrics-misleading,"I just bought the MP3 album and this does not have the explicit lyrics. The bad words are like you would hear if you were listening to it on the radio, you can't hear them. ARGH! I want my dirty words! I am very disappointed. Shame on Amazon."
5,Sweet Jesus!!,"Sweet Jesus Mary Mother of God!!! This is the best album I have bought in a long time! I bought it along with Aperitif for Destruction, and ever since I put the disc in my CD player, I haven't stopped smiling. I would recommend it to those who like uplifting tunes, who always see the glass as half full and honestly believe that every cloud really does have a silver a lining. Honestly, they do! It is such a fun album. I am now a Richard Cheese addict and am spreading the cheese as far as it will be tolerated! Every song is pure genius. Happy listening. xx"
4,Swiss Cheese has holes,"Richard Cheese makes the kind of music that you'll want to enjoy once or twice, tap your foot along with, nod your head, then put it on the CD shelf to get dusty. ""Hot for the Teacher,"" is a notable standout, with Dick really going to town with the whole big band.On each song, Cheese's rich voice and crazy piano solos make them worthwhile. Each note he sings is sustained with that powerful and suave lounge groove. If this kind of satire has to be made, its good that it was made by Richard Cheese!"
2,Crude laughs,"Give this a two for the number of times you'll think it's funny. Maybe a three over all the years you'll own it. It's crude and not real clever. Stinky Cheese! I knew better, somebody slap me!"
4,very convenient for me,"I have only owned one flash drive before this one, and I lost it. Since I am a college student, I use one very often and I can't afford to lose it again. I searched for a flash drive that could be hooked onto a keyring. I wear a retractable reel clip with my ID access card and my dorm key. And the hole thingy at the end of this flash drive makes it very easy to attach it to the key ring, and it is very small too."
5,Finally - a great Birds & Bees for boys,"After starting with my daughter on ""The Care & Keeping of You"" (by the American Girl Co.), I really wanted to find a book for my son. He is almost 11, and things are starting to happen. This was the first book that tactfully goes thru all the changes & challenges that face pre-teen and teenage boys. I was very suprised at all the areas that are covered - even more than my husband or I would've thought of talking with him about. If you are going to start with this book with a pre-teen, I would just caution to either wait a little, or read thru the book yourself first. I felt it was more geared toward either a more mature pre-teen boy or the actual teenagers. I purchased the ""Bloom"" book for my 9-year old daughter at the same time. The American Girl book is just the right stage for her. I will be waiting a while before we start on the ""Bloom"" book for the same ""maturity level"" reasons."
5,Excellent and STURDY,"When I bought this table, I also bought another style - one with two legs at the top end of the table, which come down and slide under your chair. THIS table is excellent- compared to the other which is not nearly as stable, and won't slide under all chairs - for example a recliner's leg supports are closer than the connected metal tubing which supports the second style. With THIS table, you can move the legs as needed, it has a foot rest as well and is considerably more stable than the other style. I recommend it without reservation."
3,"Good Watch, Crummy band","This is an excellent watch. very visible numbers, easy stopwatch, beep or no beep, works flawlessly. I've owned it before for many years, but had to replace it since its not quite tough enough to survive getting run over by an SUV.This time around, however, I noticed the band was more flimsy than before. Its weaker and tends to slip around on my wrist a lot. Makes it kinda annoying to wear. I've noticed that I barely wear it anymore because of the slippage."
2,"Timex makes great watches, but the band is very weak","I purchased this watch because I was looking for a digital watch with a metal band. I have always had great experiences with Timex watches. However, this band is very weak and doesn't hold up to much. It broke the first day I wore it for work. The watch itself I'm sure is good. I had a Timex watch that lasted eight years before the battery ran out. I just don't suggest this particular band."
2,"FOR A DEBUTALBUM, ITS OKAY.","This album, though not up to the mark, is still okay. Leaving out ""Where do you go"", the other tracks aren't impressive. ""Where do you go"" is fantastic !"
2,EXCELLENT book,This book is a must. The insight into how religions teach that salvation is only 'through' a church or a religion is exposed for the lie that it is. This author helps us understand that finding God can happen through our own self growth and personal relationship with Christ. Extremely well written!
3,PREVIOUSLY RECORDED MATERIALS,"THIS RECORDING PUTS TOGETHER PREVIOUSLY RECORDED MATERIALS FROM TWO OF CUBA'S GREATEST SINGERS OF ""FEELING"", BOTH SADLY GONE AND ONE, LA LUPE, MUCH BETTER KNOWN THAN THE OTHER. FREDDIE WAS A VERY CORPULENT WOMAN WHO DIED IN PUERTO RICO WHILE STILL IN HER TWENTIES, FROM A HEART ATTACK, AFTER HAVING RECORDED ONLY A HANDFUL OF SONGS, MOST OF WHICH ARE OFFERED HERE. HER MATERIAL, WHICH IS RARELY FOUND, IS FAR MORE VALUABLE THAN LA LUPE'S IN TERMS OF RARITY. SHE IS THE REASON TO BUY THIS RECORD."
4,Exxcellent results,"This is one of the best ever products I've used for my small poodle.I'd give it five stars if it tasted better to the dog. However, buried in cream cheese or sour cream she takes it gladly. I would highly recommend this product."
5,works!,"I tried this formula for my 13 year old yellow lab when the arthritis in his hind legs was no longer responding to the formula I had been using from Costco (which I still use on his younger brother). Warren Echstein, the pet expert, recommends NaturVet ArthriSoothe-GOLD on his radio program. It's the step up my lab needed. I'm very pleased with the results. His mobility is improved. The strength in his hind legs is much better. His arthritis isn't going to disappear, but it is as improved as I could hope with this formula. I highly recommend it. And he likes the taste of the chewable wafers!"
5,The very best product,"I tell everyone about the product, I stop people all over the world. I'll see someone walking their dog and it's limping and my heart just goes out to the poor thing. I'm having some cards made up so I can hand them out. My own dog would have had to be put down over a year ago now he's able to run and play...I'm so greatful for this product thank you Amazon.com for carrying it and most of all thank you NaturVet.Your loyal customer,Bernadette"
4,Noticed a BIG difference!,"I really noticed a big difference in the way my senior dog moved around after putting him on the supplement! The only bad thing that I noticed is that he seems to not like the taste! Too bad for him, though, because he acts so much better when he is on it! I recommend for any older dogs with arthritis!"
1,babies did not like,i have 5 dogs and not one like this stuff.im sure its probably a good product if you could get your dogs to eat it.
4,DIZ WAS A WHIZ,"THIS IS THE STORY OF ONE OF THE GREATEST PITCHERS AND MOST COLORFUL CHARACTERS TO EVER PUT ON A UNIFORM. DIZZY DEAN WAS A SIMPLE COUNTRY BOY WHO MADE GREAT HEADLINES WITH HIS MOUTH AND HIS GREAT PITCHING ARM. DIZ WAS VERY COCKY, BRASH, AND OUTSPOKEN ABOUT HIMSELF AND HIS BROTHER PAUL'S ABILITIES. A VERY COLORFUL AND HUMOROUS CHARACTER. AFTER HIS CAREER ENDED WAY BEFORE IT SHOULD HAVE, DIZ BECAME A VERY POPULAR BROADCASTER WHO LET HIS NATURAL, COUNTRY, HUMOROUS STYLE BECOME HIS TRADEMARK AS ONE OF GREATS ON TV AND RADIO. A VERY INTERESTING BOOK ABOUT BOTH DIZ AND BASEBALL IN GENERAL DURING THE DEPRESSION. VERY RECOMMENDED."
4,Way better than no coffee at all,"I have bad reflux and had pretty much given up coffee and I've been drinking decaf for years. So I'm not a gourmet coffee drinker by any means (although I remember how good coffee can be). That said, this is better than I hoped and I drink my coffee black. It is a French roast and has that taste so you may not like it if you don't care for the French roast. It doesn't bother my throat like regular decaf even if I drink 2 cups. Makes me happy every time I sip a fresh hot cup!"
5,Great low acid coffee,"I have IC and cannot tolerate coffee, regular or decaf. I tried the herbal coffees and I liked them but they did not like me, caused bloating etc. Found this on-line and thought what the heck. I personally find the french roast quite robust un-like a few others but generally I'm more of a flavored coffee person. I also buy the hazelnut beans from them and mix the two. I can drink two cups of this along with a couple of prelief and feel fine. I wish there was hazelnut decaf but other then that am very pleased and will continue to buy this coffee."
3,Best of the acid reducing but still...,"Best of its kind. But really I had no idea that reducing the acid in coffee would also materially change the ""taste"" quite so much. I tried and tried again but in the end I switched back to normal coffee. I had read from some sites how the acid really does effect the taste but I didnt believe it until now."
2,Not so good,"If your table has a lip that comes down, just a couple inches inside the bottome edge of the tabletop, forget this chair. It will fit on in most cases, but instead of being belly up to the table, the baby will sit 2-4 inches away from the edge. Also... this is not safe on a small table. My son barely weighs 22 lbs and just about flipped grandma's table over!"
5,Effective Therapy - I Recommend It,"This book was very informative, clearly written, easy to understand, and gave me new insight into alternative approaches to therapy. Dr. Hurd is direct and to the point, which is a writing style that I enjoy and benefit from significantly when I need to get a new perspective and some new ideas. I learned alot from the book and would recommend it highly."
5,Classic Gospel,"I truly appreciate this being released. Doug Miller was the man in the 80's. Songs like ""Pass Me Not"", ""How Long Has It Been Since You Prayed"" and many others. I reccomend this one. Twinkie Clark is wearing that organ out on ""Send It On Down"". I wish they would have put ""I Still Love THe Name Jesus"" with this cd but hey, I'm satisfied. If they could have also put the ""Light years"" stuff on here. (Unspeakable Joy) that would have been on the money."
1,BAD MEANS BAD AS IN REALLY BAD,"I GOT TRICKED INTO BUYING THIS CD. THE LEAD SINGER SUCKS.I KNOW THERE ARE ALOT OF GREAT BANDS OUT THERE WITH A NOT SO GOOD LEAD SINGER. BUT I WOULDNT LIE. THIS GUY TAKES THE CAKE.NOT TO MENTION, WEAK LYRICS. NOT ORIGINAL AT ALL.GO TO THIER WEBSITE AND DOWNLOAD A WHOLE SONG. SEE FOR YOURSELF. YOU WILL THANK ME LATER."
1,"Great design, in a useless prdocuct!","The problem: Size. This bag can't hold even the smallest tripod on the market. Let's face it, it's beautibul but i'm using it to carry my External Hard Drive, which is not what i intended when i bought it. I had to buy a Pelican Padded Tripod Bag, 48 Inch Length, and i'm really satisfied."
4,"Cool Sim game, old though","This game came in the six pack that was for $20, back in 2000.I still own this game, though I'm probably going to get rid of it because it messes up on my Windows ME.The graphics are well done for an old game, and it's fun to choose the different weapons and cars. On some levels you start out with $20,000 which gives you a chance to buy a bunch of stuff. The two best weapons are the machine gun and missle launcher. The Spiked tires are cool because their useful against oil slick. One thing that wierd is when you hit one of the cows grazing on the pasture, they fly up in the air and smash on the ground like porcelain.(It's funny to hear the moooo as the cow flies up)Buy this game here on Amazon, cause it's cheap."
3,NO Director's Commentary,"I love this movie, and that's why I bought it.However, the box says that there is a Director's Commentary option on the disk. I couldn't find it. Could anyone else?"
3,It has it's good points but could be better,"I've had this watch for about 3 months now. Prior to this I was not a watch wearer, so comfort was a major issue. This watch fits nicely and is very comfortable. It's a bit too bulky and I accidentally bump buttons pretty often. Although, the fact that it's still in good shape is a good point.It's easy to operate. The indigo is bright enough, but the night feature doesn't seem to be a feature at all. It doesn't do anything. The alarm could be a bit louder. Also, it only has one alarm, and with two kids in school at different times, I need more than one alarm. The blue part of the watch looks knicked already but the band is still in great shape. It's a good watch for the price, but I think next time I'll go a bit more feature heavy and a slimmer style."
3,WATCH,The watch works fine. The white details around the face and band are coming off already. I've only had the watch about 2 weeks. I do like all the functions on this watch and brand.
4,My favorite East German musical!,"This movie is great! Obviously inspired by American beach movies of the sixties, I think it out-performs them. I don't care much for the ending, but I guess in the end the two who are still together kinda deserve each other.Loved the music!"
4,Interesting take on interstellar civilization,It was interesting to read a story about interstellar civilization addressed from the point of view of its affect of instantaneous travel on a planet's economy. It was interesting to see a man from a civilization based on doing a little real work as possible thrown into a civilization of Rational Christians where he is required to do physical labor. All civilizations seem to have all the nanomachines and AI that they want. The reader watches the protagonist grow in understanding of the strengths and failings of himself and the civilizations.
4,A sprawling Sci fi Adventure,"A million open doors is the first in one of John Barne's most popular series. I re-read this book with anticipation and hoped it would be as good as I remembered. It's a little slow-paced in places, but the displays of imagination are fantastic. Barnes sets a big stage in a future where Springers, interstellar gates, have spread humanity across the stars. When the book starts, our heroes are ridiculous overpriviledged kids who bicker and posture and fight just to pass the time. They have it so good, there's nothing else to occupy them. A million open doors really starts to take off when Giraut has leave to nest. Following him as the scales fall from his eyes is a great adventure."
3,"What's All the Hubbubb, Bub?","Even though the book is a fair read, good for a rainy weekend, or putting one to sleep of a night, I don't find it the award winning fair that so many critics' opinions say it is.If you like a bunch of dandies waltzing about, drinking and wenching, then having the hero throwing himself into an altogether stange, socialistic society in the aftermath of a romantic betayal, this is your book; but I found it lacked enough action to keep the storyline moving, and to hold this reader's attention.I am waiting to read ""Earth Made of Glass"", in hope that it is more attention keeping than ""A Million Open Doors""."
4,A good read,"If you enjoy science fiction of any sort, you will enjoy this book. While it is not the ""hard"" science fiction that I usually enjoy, it is ""hard"" enough not to include any Wizards, Elves, Halflings, Trolls, Druids,Unicorns or sentient cats.Read it, you won't be disappointed."
2,flopped soufflé,"overhyped. the recipe was sound, the execution poor. enjoyable premises, hence, the generous two stars. Nou Occitan, with its troubador bravura and artifice is a winner. alas, the choppy writing quality, narrative gaps and descriptive flatness are tiresome. an overlong novella fit for speedreading at best. nebula nominee? in future, i won't be suckered by that line again."
5,Great resource,"Wow, this is a great book! My wife and I are planning a trip and this book has been worth every penny we spent. It gives you tremendous insight into the various cruise lines, what to expect, do's and don'ts, excursion planning etc.If you're spending the money to go on an Alaskan cruise, buy this book, it will help you pick the right one for you."
2,Nothing new here...,"If you are a CRM novice or a manager this book will confuse you. The book is probably useful if your background is data warehousing.I found the book poorly structured and difficult to read. The book is chock-full of tables and checklists, full of trivial information. It is little wonder that most CRM initiatives fail. Management-by-checklist appears to be the norm in the industry.Effective CRM requires re-defining front-end and back-end processes. The basic CRM rule is simple: technology and features change, processes endure. Unfortunately, how to design, modify or tweak processes is not covered in this book or others in this genre. Unless and until managers understand the basics of multi-channel process redesign, companies are bound to fail at CRM."
2,Tangible intangibles??,"Suppose a company puts a lot of money and effort in the research and design of a product. These are intangibles. The product, however, does not sell. The research and design have not turned into tangible profits. Then what? In my opinion, they are wasted. This is market risk. Intangibles matter only when they turn into tangibles."
3,Aren't we just supposed to be friends?,"I enjoyed Courting Courtney.Though I may just be biased because I have been a fan of Dana Gould for about 4 years. Late bloomer in that department I know. This movie attracts indie flimmakers, bleeding heart 20somethings, ""nice"" guys, ""nice"" girls and the classic guy/gal... ain't we just friends? Okay it is bare bones, but that is grand in my book. It has the feeling of a play. Hey you will recognize some names in the cast, so there.Get the film, get a bag o' snacks, grab your other half and be glad that's done or drown your empathetic heart into the chocolate bar ya just bought.Cast ListDana Gould Eliza Coyle Taylor Negron Sean Masterson Anne Mattingley Al Schuermann Ryan Stiles Doug McKeon Julia Sweeney Kathy Griffin Chris Hardwick Ana Gasteyer Lance August Joseph LawsonHave fun recognizing So Cal lo-cals! Lookout for the freeway overpass! Yikes!"
1,Don't Bother,"The acting is terrible, the script is contrived, the lead characters aren't likable, and the dialogue is not funny. Also, the ""great moments"" are a direct ripoff from ""When Harry Met Sally""."
5,Crazy as a Jay,"Suzy's book, ""The Naked Bird Watcher"", is an autobiographical account of her struggle with bipolar disorder. It is very well-written and speaks to bipolar and non-bipolar folk alike. What I liked best about the book is that Suzy documents what worked for her and what didn't, something that is important for all mentally ill folks to pay attention to and to work on in our own lives. Suzy's positive approach and hopeful message make this book a must-read.The new 2004 Cairn edition is revised and contains a great deal of new information about Suzy's recent work in the Mental Health Awareness and Advocacy fields."
4,The Naked Bird Watcher,I don't read much. This was good and said what I feel like sometimes and it made me feel better about it.
2,Did not last one whole day,Addie our 5 year old pit bull mix had gotten one of these balls (identical size and color)as present about a year ago. she loved it and played with it everyday. It lasted her almosta year before she chewed thru and it had to be tossed out. I wanted her to have a new onesince it was her favorite toy. Took her about 4 hours to chew thru this one and it hadto be tossed out. In all honesty I waited too long to send complaint or ask for refund.So that is my fault for procrastination. but if you have a chewer this ball probablywont stand up well for unsupervised play.
2,Hard plastic ball,This ball has a great concept but my dog does not care for it since the outer portion is hard plastic. I also do not feel it is worth 20 dollars.
2,my dog isn't that interested,"it looked cool and is probably a good toy for a lot of dogs, but my very active 2-year-old lab mix rarely goes for it."
5,Dog Goes Crazy Over This Ball,I have a German Shepherd that loves this ball.It is made of heavy plastic so it doesn't get destroyed like allot of her other toys do.
3,Warning: Can Cause Injury,"My 8 month GSD loved his 10"" Teaser Ball - too much. He chewed the edges of the openings until rough, then picked it up and shook it proudly. It sliced off a patch of his previously beautiful face, taking skin with hair. If you can quickly train your dog not to chew on it and shake it, it's a great toy. Definitely supervise play."
3,Can be chewed through quickly,"My dog has had several of these balls and loves them. We've renamed them Crack Balls because he is addicted to them. The only thing is that he can chew through them fairly quickly. I think that they've started to make them with thinner plastic, so they don't last very long. It's kind of disappointing because I love watching him play with it, but I can't justify the price when they only last a day or so."
2,Not good for chewers,I bought this for my golden retriever and american bulldog hearing it was nearly indestructible. After about 30 minutes of playing it was completely destroyed. Very disappointed in this purchase.
5,Durable,My dog likes to chew. A lot. She destroys soccer balls and volley balls in less than 5 minutes. But this one just doesn't pop or get destroyed. And it keeps her busy - she literally tosses it around and throws it for herself to catch! I should really make a video of her doing that and send it to the company because it's so cute...
4,fun and entertaining toy,"Bought this toy for an English Mastiff puppy, and he thinks it's great. He pushes it around with his nose and tries to get the smaller ball out. I have been incredibly happy with all of the Jolly Pets products that I've purchased and will continue to use them."
5,Long lasting and a good play toy,"I bought this product because my dog could chew her way through anything. I bought Kong toys, even the Kong itself which she figured out how to dismantle and they were all a waste of money. This is about the only toy that remained undefeated by her. I would recommend it to any dog owner but especially ones with strong chewers!"
5,Excellent choice,This was a replacement because I drove over her other one; but my Boxer just LOVES this ball. She plays a solo game of soccer and runs all around the yard pushing this ball and growling at it. She even sleeps with it on her bed (not allowed on mine). She won't even let my Pit play with it. He has to steal it when she is not looking; but very determined to get it back from him. Too funny!
1,What the heck?!,"If I could give 0 stars and still write a review, I would. This came with no inner ball. I've ordered one of these before and it was fine. I can't believe something so obvious was overlooked. So much for quality assurance Amazon."
3,Cool Toy for Your Dogs,Cool product with a great concept. My dogs love it. The material on the outside is well made and perfect for chewing. After fetching the tennis ball the dogs are excited to try to get it out of being hidden in another ball.
5,Jolly Ball's Great,"My Collie loves to play with her Jolly Ball, she rolls it all over the house and keeps bringing it to me to roll and then she chases it."
2,maybe okay for some dogs...not for labs,"When we received this ball, I thought we would really like it and for about a half day we thoroughly enjoyed watching our lab nose the ball around, but shortly thereafter we had to take the ball away from her and throw it away. She was nibbling the plastic off around the ball opening. Again, this may be an okay toy if you don't have a strong chewer, but I would not recommend this ball for labs."
2,Jolly Ball doesn't hold interest,"My labrador retriever hasn't shown an interest in the 10"" Jolly Pet Teaser Ball. I have tried to encourage her to play with it but no luck. She doesn't have any sort of obsession with balls or playing fetch, one or two throws and she's done, so possibly it just isn't her thing. It looks fun to me and I can certainly see where some dogs would find it fascinating."
1,Stop teasing me!,"I've bought my dog a lot of toys over the past few months and her reaction to them has been predictable: A lot of initial interest and less interest over time. With this toy, however, she rolled it around for a minute, trying to pick it up or get the ball inside, and got so frustrated that she started barking at it nonstop! She barks at it every time she sees it now. :( She has some major issues with frustration regulation and obsessing over things both positive and negative in many areas, but this has been my only experience of her just hating a toy. I felt pretty bummed about that given the price and other reviews."
1,not what I ordered,"I ordered a red teaser ball and the title specifically says red. received purple. if wanted purple, would have ordered purple. if red wasn't available, should have been notified. don't like surprises."
3,Average,"The ball doesn't roll off course and the dogs don't really play it with it on their own - only if it's thrown. They lose interest quickly. Our dogs are two labs who love balls, so it's suprising that they don't engage as much. However, the ball is very sturdy and it can't be chewed through, so it's durable!"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the 10 in teaser ball for my goldendoodle after seeing a smaller one in a store because she has loved other ""teaser"" type toys. Unfortunately, not this one.I have had it for a while now and she has not shown much interest in it. The only time she plays with it is when I stuff it with other things that she can retrieve out of it.It also would have been helpful on these kinds of items to have a size recommendation based on weight or breed.I don't know if a different size would make a difference.Maybe I didn't get right size."
1,dog owner,This ball is fun for dogs. Mine loves to chase it while it is rolling. The ball cracked after only having it for only two days when I threw it across the yard and it landed on grass. I had a smaller jolly pet teaser ball before that lasted over a year before cracking. The hard plastic just doesn't work on bigger sized ball.
1,edge chipping and staining,"After only one hour of play time with my 7 month old JRT, this product failed.The edges of the circles began to crumble off, and when I touched it a deepdark blue came off on my fingers.I would not recommend this product to ANY pet owner."
3,Won't buy again for my dog.,"I usually buy the smaller version for my heavy chewing dog. I bought this larger one for her on Christmas and she had ruined it in about 10 minutes. She is a medium sized dog, but she was able to get more access in the larger openings to chew and bend them. I had to throw it away that night because I didn't want her cutting herself on the sharp edges or swallowing any pieces. I'm sure this would be fine for a larger dog who doesn't chew quite as much. I'll stick with the smaller version now. She's never broken the one she has."
3,too heavy,"This was too heavy for my Border Collie mix to push and roll with any speed, but she could grab hold of the openings to carry the ball, which was a plus. All in all, it's not a total waste of money as others have been, but it would be much better if it was lighter weight."
5,Dog enjoys it immensely,Sturdiest ball we own. I have several teaser balls. They do get the inner ball out but continue to play with the outer ball for months. My pups love them.
3,india in black and white,india in black and whitethe editing for this book is not the best --some of the images should have been excludedthere are some very strong images here but the editor should have gathered a larger body of work from the photographer before producing this book
2,Poor recording quality...Perhaps disc oxidized...,The music recorded as such of poor quality...will scuttle of as gift to someone not particular.or simply throw away...in the garbage
3,Not Lovely,I expected more from this CD. My recollection of the music from the film of the same name was of better produced music. Try another CD for Cole Porter
4,A powerful take on a misidentified issue,"A wonderful book, although I believe the title of the book (at least that of its main essay) does not accurately describe the content of Quine's argument. Without providing any basis for such a step, Quine equates ontology with a study of the implications of the meta-language. True, language is a crucial part of how we form our conception of the world, but to assume that there is nothing (or very little) else to the foundational possibility of such a conception is to be too dismissive of what Fichte argued, with a set of very strong arguments, to be the main problem of philosophy: does the human mind's propensity to ascribe objective existence to the putative referents of its own ideas (and words) represent an illusion or a truthful induction?"
4,Love Fat Daddio's,Great quality pan. I needed something for single personal cakes and this was perfect! I have recommended this brand to a co-worker. Would recommend.
5,great pan,great pan. i haven't used it much but it seems to heat evenly. don't handle roughly because it could bend (i have a rectangular one from the same brand and it bended in one spot)
5,Great quality,Professional quality baking pans at a great price. I have other Fat Daddio pans and they work like their supposed to.
4,Purchased to make granddaughter cake for 1st birthday,Excellent product and was well pleased with the resulting smash cake. Would recomment the pans for small cakes. Cleans up well.
5,Fat Daddio pans are great!,"Fat Daddio pans are consistently good. I have a couple different sizes in both the round and square pans, and they always yield evenly baked cakes. They are not nonstick, so I always line the bottom with parchment paper and make sure the sides are greased and floured. For cleanup, I usually have to wash the pans by hand since the dishwasher can't quite get the baked cake that makes its way into the corner. If you're willing to do a bit of extra work for really nicely baked cakes, these are great pans!"
5,A great pan!,"It is heavy and very well-made. A lot of pans are short, but I bake sponge cakes, so it should be deep and I just found those and purchased. It was a good purchase."
3,Cake pan,"This cake pan was fine...nothing special but nothing dissapointing, just an average cake pan, I selected it for its price."
5,No rust.,"Most other pans, even non-stick, will rust after a few uses. But not these fairly heavyweight anodized aluminum. I found them to be the longest lasting pans, and stay nice looking too.The same brand Fat Daddio's makes several other types: such as oblong cake pans, sheet cookie pans, meat loaf pans. All these are my first choice.In fact these are so good, I find excuses to put them to use double duty like this:Small diameter 2"" high cakepans as rugged non rust mini meatloaf pans, not too tall for a toaster oven:4x2 = 25 cubic inches5x2 = 396x2 = 577x2 = 77A one pound hamburger meatloaf pan (8-1/2 by 4-1/2 by 2-1/2 inches) = 96 cubic inchesLarger diameters of the same height can serve as no spill/no mess serving trays for away from the table meals, e.g.holidays or TV. For instance five trays stored nested, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12.Fat Daddio's round cakepan sizes are inside, a 14 inch pan will be a tiny bit under 14 inches inside, 14-1/2 outside (two quarter inch rims)."
2,They fade in dish washer,"I would like to say I loved this pan when I first seen it. I used it twice but I didnt was it in my dish washer I hand washed it and it was fine. However as soon as i put it in my dishwasher it faded to an ugly ruined color so i really dont think theses pans are dishwasher safe. I will keep the pan because it make a perfect cake, but my concern is whether this pan will cause problems. All of you that posted great reviews have you put it in a dishwasher as of yet."
3,Non-stick??,"I read the reviews about cakes coming out clean from these pans and I was very excited-- I just got a cake decorating kit and I was incredibly excited about using it so I got a set of new pans... well the cake was an ABSOLUTE disaster. When I flipped the first cake pan over, the cake was stuck. I tried to use the tried and true spatula around the side of the pan method, only to discover that bottom was stuck too so about 1/2"" of the cake did not come out of the bottom of the pans.Long story short, a cake with too rough of sides to decorate and uneven bottoms... NOT what was I hoping. I am giving it a 3 out of 5 because I know that I am not a pro baker and thus my cake may have been partly at fault, but I figure most people buying cake pans are just amateurs too."
1,Made in China,"I contacted Fat Daddio's via email to see where these pans were manufactured. They never got back to me and I needed the pans fast so I ordered. The Wilton's are available at AC Moore and Michael's but are made in Indonesia. I checked Fat Daddio's website for info and although it doesn't say where they are made there are pics of a large manufacturing facility located in Tenn. When I received these the first thing I noticed is the sticker on the bottom of the pan that says ""Made in China."" I may send them back. I really want Amazon to list the country of manufacture on all items right below the name of the item. Amazon shoppers, please encourage Amazon via email or phone to do this, please."
5,Fat Daddio's Round Cake Pans,The quality of these cake pans is exceptional. Item shipped quickly. I am pleased with this purchase. Amazon offers amazing bakeware.
3,Poor manufacturing quality.,"I must have gotten a bum copy. For several of the races featured on the disc, the video quality is extremely poor. The screen will flicker about every second. In their coverage of the Indy race, the top 1/3rd of the screen just shows some garbled mess that never moves throughout their coverage! This mess only happens in 3 races, but it's still very annoying. The coverage of the other races comes in crystal clear."
1,Milanoguy,"I bought this DVD in spite of the bad review from the guy in Laguna Beach. Well he was right and I was wrong. This is a terrible DVD. It is much worse than the season reviews on VHS that I've buying and watching for years. It is very hard to watch a complete race, there is less racing footage than before, and you can't watch the complete season in one sitting. Get familiar with your menu settings on your remote control you will be using them a lot."
4,Where are the word's?,"As a formula one championship review it's by far the most excelent ever done, but in my opinion, in a race there are other significant moments such a pre/post-race interviews with pilots, managers & others, funny moments and behind the scenes moments that maybe can make this feature more atractive.Once you saw 5-6 races resume, you begin to feel that the other ones are kind of boring because they have the same camera takes, and the lenght's are almost the same too.Either way I'm expecting the release of the 2001 championship review, thinking that perhaps the producer's maybe have been thinking about it before.Be sure if you buy it you're going to enjoy every race because it has some details that you can't see on the TV transmission"
3,"Not as good as the latest F1 Reviews, but still not bad....","In addition to the 2000 review, I also have the 2004, 2005 & 2007 review DVDs. I think it's just a natural progression that they get better as time goes on. I for one didn't really like the way that this DVD was broken down into so many menu items. Too much navigating to watch it. It would have been much better to have just added the extra footage into the race video. However, having said all of that, 2000 was the year that Shumacher and Barrichelo in their Ferraris fought it out with Hakkinen and Coulthard in their McLarens. Although the race footage wasn't the highest quality, it was truly enjoyable getting to watch the season progress. If you're a true F1 fan, you'll enjoy this video. It was a great recap of an exciting year in F1."
2,Could have been much better...,"I have to say I'm a little disappointed. I was under the impression that this DVD contained the full races. Instead, you are provided with a narrated highlight reel of the race....not even the original announcer is heard. I has also hoped for at least one full lap shown ""in-car"", but again, they only show highlights for a few seconds of a lap. The interactive portion is confusing at best, and it's difficult to know if you are missing things and you end up watching the same clips multiple times as a result.Overall: Come out with a DVD of the entire season, showing each race fully. Comment on the off-track events of the season. Show some behind the scenes F1 footage. Show some full lap in-car scenes. This DVD has none of what I just described, and will now sit and gather dust."
5,Looks Great!,I put this on the back of my truck and have gotten lot of comments! Good and bad since we do live in a very religious area...
5,It sticks to the car,It's been through several washings without coming off. I don't know what else you can ask of a car emblem.
3,"Neat, but...","While I certainly enjoyed the looks of this symbol and having it on my car, the adhesive is none too impressive. It has since fallen off of my car in the month I've owned it. I'm going for the magnetic one next time."
4,Darwin fish,I wanted this emblem for my vehicle to replace the ones the fundies keep ripping off. They sure don't like it when you express your right to free speech which is what I see this emblem being used for.
1,The Truth will set you Free!,"I can't wait to put this on my car, upside down!!!! I'm sure I will be tailgated, given the middle finger and spit upon! and possibly have my car vandalized. The Truth will set you free!"
2,Adhesive doesn't stick,"It was a lot cheaper feeling than I thought it was going to be for $10. I didn't realize it was just really light plastic. It also had terrible adhesive, and fell off of my car after about a day without any precipitation. It's currently sitting in my glove box because I apparently need to buy new adhesive because the old one simply does not stick."
4,Excelen!,"Este artículo, es de plástico, pero luce metalico.Se ve muy bien, quizás el único inconveniente, es que el adhesivo (que se pega muy bien, y nunca se ha movido) es una franja rectangular, que no pega ""la cola"" del logo. De todos modos, pega bien.This article is plastic, but it looks metallic.It looks great, perhaps the only drawback is that the adhesive (which sticks very well, and has never moved) is a rectangular strip, which will not fit the ""tail"" of the logo. Anyway, sticks well."
4,Wonderful quality,The product came in great condition. It securely attached to the back of our car. I am pleased with the quality of the item as well. Great fun for a great price.
5,Great little emblem,"Looks good, sticks well. Can't say too much more. I guess I probably wouldn't recommend it if you are a fundamentalist Cristian."
3,Glass Harmonica Doesn't Rock,"I'm sure it takes a great deal of talent to play the instrument Benjamin Franklin invented. I've heard stories that it slowly drives it's players mad because of the purity of the crystalline sound. The same could be said for the gentle listener. One or two tracks is fine for a diversion but an album full grates on the ear in short order. That said, I will listen to it from time to time just for the truly AMAZING SOUND."
5,Brilliant -if you can get it!!!,This is a work of honesty and humour. If you can get your hands on it and you are interested in travel in the east of Oz. you would be mad not to! I know some towns were pretty angry at the author but - well - he was just telling it like it is... Very witty and insightful!
5,Superb as always,"What can I say?It's beautiful music (Not all countries can say the same)with the super production of David Foster, the magic of the Vancouver Orchestra and the excellent voice of Lara Fabian.It takes your breath away when the drums goes in.Extra recommended if you're a David Foster fan."
4,Chart Your Success on the Compass is a Real Help,I teach Intermediate Algebra for a two year college in the North East Georgia Mountains. My students using this text have had great success in focusing their study time when preparing for the Compass Test. The book is laid out in short 2 - 6 page chapters and does an excellent job at keeping the information compact and precise. Students studying for the compass exam are sure to find the text's layout and design easy to read and understand. Each section gives students the opportunity to work sample exam problems and provides answers to these problems at the end of the text.
2,"Focused on politics and mush, not on hiking","I know of the AT and the PCT, and I'd hoped this would be a travelogue/guide to a coastal trek. There's some of that, but also way too much of the author's personality and political views."
3,Label Factory,Somewhat outdated. Watch for version dates! I can't blame the company of the product when I don't check it a little better. It is over 10 years old.
5,Excellent Book,"""Fire Up Your Metabolism"" is an EXCELLENT book for anyone who wants to lose weight in a healthy manner and keep the pounds off. One of my favorite parts about the philosophy the book provides for losing weight is that I am able to eat carbohydrates and still lose weight. Thank you Nutrition Twins for helping me fire up my metabolism!!!!"
1,Didn't Work for Me,"I tried this plan and promptly gained three pounds!! This diet has a heavy emphasis on carbs, which is the kiss of death for someone like me who is carb sensitive. Those of you who are carb sensitive beware!!"
4,Great Book- So Easy to Read!,"I bought this book 2 weeks ago and I love it.It was very easy to understand.I am an identical twin too so I thought it was cool. Both my twin and I are trying to lose some weight so this book will help us. I wont make her a ""guinea pig"" though. Smiles! Great book!"
4,Trainers in a Book,"In the introduction there is a quiz which reveals if your metabolism is slowing. Your score is an indicator on how many percentage points you should follow in the book. But there is so much information just what constitutes a percentage?Throughout the book there are tips on certain food groups and/or individual brands of food. It also includes Myth busters which reviews certain myths about food with updated info. Chapter 5 Favoring Fabulous Fats provides plenty of information that will help manage fat intake and power up metabolism. Additionally, I like the self dietary experiments that the two presented ie What happens to your body when you skip breakfast? Lack of sleep? Not enough water?"
4,Very enjoyable and interesting,"I've just started to read more about Churchill and I thought this was a great summary of some of his most important speeches. I thought it was well edited by his grandson. I throughly enjoyed his grandson's commentary and it was very helpful in having the speeches listed by date. Churchill's speech style was incredible and he wrote his own speeches, which in today's world is amazing. I would highly recommend this book and I look forward to reading Churchill's account of WWII next."
5,The greatness of Churchill's speeches,"One can feel it from the very first speeches. Churchill had a spirit , a life, a kind of vitality and energy in all that he did. Even in the most ordinary matters he conveys a certain excitement and drama. This is of course especially true in the great speeches that rallied the British people in the Second World War. The Dunkirk speech, the ""we will never surrender"" words, the ""Finest Hour"" words of determination and defiance. Along with the great sweep of heroic feeling there is a language somehow so visceral, so capable of stirring the emotions.And it is important to remember that these speeches were not simply brilliant rhetorical performances, but were historical actions of the first order which had meaning in the great struggle to save freedom and human civilization."
4,Grim determination,"Despite the sometimes ponderous language the man's grim determination never to give in on important matters is evident. His respect for parliament, the niceties of formal relationships and his conviction that democracy is the only acceptable form of government also stand out. His tremendous stamina is amazing. I'm glad I bought the book."
1,Deceptive,"The label shows the ingredients as: Vitamin C 500 mg, L-glutathione 50 mg, L-Cysteine 200 mg. ONLY 50 mg of what you think your buying."
2,jerry pickens,"Well this review isn't so good,because I wanted the product mainly for the Glutathione which was Only 50mg.! Followed up with Vitamin C 500mg&L-Cysteine Hydrochloride 200mg.Not that the others were not ok,but in my opinion the Glutathione should have been 500mg.If someone else needed this product in the order prescribed on the label Fine,Not for me.The ingredient label wasn't noted on webpage description."
1,"Lets play, ""Whats In The Box?""","Whoever packed the box, really... It wasn't even close.I shoulda known that $65 for a 4 pot caliper was kinda pushing my luck.Caliper came from ""Source Media Group"".Obviously not a auto parts shop or they would have known that what they put in the box was junk, or was that the intent? I guess Amazon is going to play ""hot potato"" with this box until somebody keeps it."
4,Great Beat!,"The first time I heard Boa Drape is while checking out the latest MP3's on line. I heard ""Another Day"" and totally fell in love with the song. Just checking out the other samples of songs..so far so good."
5,What a find!,"I never heard of Cesium 137 before until recently. I was checking out the different albums people had bought in the industrial genre, and I came across a few who had gotten Cesium 137.So I checked out this album.It was a good choice to check out this album first. Their style is very different from a lot of the other industrial artists out there, and they seem to be going in the same direction as most forward thinking industrial bands, like Mesh or Seabound, taking on this lighter feel, with more emotion in the vocals, more of a...joyous, sound rather than, sad and monotonous. Perhaps they are going off to found a whole new genre of music in themselves!But anyway, key tracks on this album are ""Gravity"" (my favorite), ""Agonist"" and ""Transient"". All these tracks show the band's ability to manipulate sound, and layer things in an intelligent and pleasing way to the ear! These songs truly immerse you in sound.Pick this one up. It's a good buy, I'm not lying."
5,"Concise, to-the-point guide to happiness.","Yes, it is really possible. You can be happy. This little book is worth much more than it's weight in gold. I've read it several times and find that the Option Method really works. Even as a professional counselor, I always thought that most of the fear and hurts of life just had to be coped with. I had always been taught that unhappiness was just plain inevetable. Now, I find I was wrong, thankfully. This book shows how our beliefs cause most of our unhappiness, and it shows how to change beliefs in order to become a happier person. It works."
1,BAD BOOK! BAD BOOK!,"I could not believe the format and content of this book when I requested it from NU's library. How did it get published? There are so many typos and it was badly written; it's an insult to refer to this material as a book, let alone allow it to represent Black/Latino life. Please attend workshops in creative writing, take courses at your local university, read other literature, something, but don't publish anymore!"
2,African Americans? Hispanics? African descent or HUMAN RACE of one mankind.,"This book and the play was not what I expected. It is basically about two different cultures and African Americans trying to point out that we are like them because we have African roots. I agree that we do share African roots but the similarities stop there. African American culture is not as influenced from Africa as the Hispanic culture is. You can hear the drums and rhythm in our music and taste the herbs & spices in our food. Yes, we both hail from African roots the same way Middle Easterns, Brazilians, Scilians, Asians, etc. do however our cultures are different. Either way, why drone on about ""blackness"" when we should embrace all cultures and just get along instead of feeling you have to prove who is of African ancenstory or not. In the end, we are all of the human race. And that's ONE race and that alone is a beautiful thing."
5,A must for all 'Little House' lovers!,"This CD is a perfect complement to the Little House book(s), bringing to life many of the songs written out in the famous series. It embodies the spirit of these fascinating pioneers, who turned to music as a welcome respite after a long day. As the CD begins, one can easily imagine the comforting sounds of Pa playing by the fire while the prarie winds howl!Mary DesRosiers sings with traditional musicians (fiddle, guitar), bringing new life to these old songs with a clear, melodic style. Children love ""Camptown Races,"" and Mary does a beautiful version of the traditional ""Barbara Allen.""A copy of the Little House book and this CD would make a great gift for young people discovering the books, or older people REdiscovering the books! It's a great family CD, that *everyone* can enjoy (not just the kids.)"
4,Some Good Blues,"Pretty good stuff. Especially liked the rendition of TV Mama. Lots of other good stuff although Shotgun Blues is a bit too depressing. Otherwise, fun stuff, a lot of variety."
5,AIC collectors should buy this..........,"In the start there is about 10 minutes of footage before the band became famous, and between the videos there are clips of the band being silly and having fun. If you are a fan of the band, I would definetly invest in this video. You wont be sorry."
5,Awesome...,"If you're an Alice in Chains fan or just a fan of the Seattle sound, this dvd is a must. It's amazing but makes me feel sad for what could've been."
3,Defective DVD?,"I am a huge AIC fan, and was thrilled when I saw the VHS copy of this. I've watched it more times than I can count. So why the 3 stars? Something is a little goofy with the sound on the DVD, and I've heard the same complaint from other people. The harmonies are the most affected, with Jerry completely drowning Layne out on some songs.All in all, stick with the VHS copy. It's outstanding."
5,One of the best home videos ever made,"Without a doubt one of the best home videos ever made, ""Video Bank"" captures Alice in Chains greatest accomplishments, their videos aren't just music clips, but forms of fantastic art. The documentary in the beginning is pretty cool and you get to see AIC before they went big, they were just a humble bunch of guys wanting to play music. Every one of the videos are great, but the standouts for me personally are ""I Stay Away"" and ""Grind"". AIC will always have a special place in my heart, and if the band is indeed gone, with this video they'll live on forever."
5,The sound couldn't be better,"Let's get this straight: this DVD has great sound. They took the time to mix it for multi channel, and the result is completely satisfiying.Some people here have said that the sound is awful, and (as some other users have pointed) it must be because they heard the 5.1 mix in an stereo equipment, getting the sound only partially. They should have chosen the PCM audio track instead, before writting misleading opinions.So, wether you are an AIC fan, or a fan of grunge, this is a must have. This DVD visually documents the work of a great group, with the best sound you can get. Some videos could be considered ""ordinary"" but most of them have great quality of images and/or concepts. And they are intertwined by home footage and concert images, so basically, we have a 1 and half hour peek of the work of the band."
5,"A ""Must Have""","This video collection is awesome. The variety is great. The home videos give some insight into ""regular guys"" with GREAT talent who are a little uncomfortable in front of the lens (except when they are performing). In other words, you can tell that, with them, it's definitely about the MUSIC. And they did some of the very best made in the nineties (and looked awesome doing it, from the female perspective). Highlights include Grind, Again, We Die Young, I Stay Away, and Rooster. I highly recommend this collection to any AIC fan."
2,Not what I hoped for,The DVD was shipped and arrived in a timely fashion and in good shape. However the DVD content was too much of a documentary style (with some language) whereas I'd hoped for just music videos. I'll just regift it to a die-hard Alice in Chains fans and I'm sure they'll be excited.
4,Jerry Anderson's first series,"More marvels from the United Kingdom. Supermarionation is a the name that producer Jerry Anderson came up with to describe his unique shows that shows that used marionettes in amazing miniature sets of building and vehicles of the future. The shows included Thunderbirds, Stingray, Captain Scarlet, and of course Supercar the show that started it all.The Supercar can drive on land, fly, and go inot the depths of the sea. It is housed at a secret location in the Nevada desert, and Doctor Beaker and professor Popkiss are its inventors. The heroic pilot is Mike Mercury, and young Jimmy and his monkey Mitch are part of the adventure.Jerry Anderson went to also create live action shows such as UFO, Space 1999, and more."
5,Indispensible!,"I bought this stovetop espresso maker because I live abroad (without a Starbucks, or anything like it, in sight), and I really missed good lattes and cappuccinos. I didn't want to pay $500+ for an espresso machine, though. I've been using the coffee maker for over a year now, and honestly, I don't think I could live without it. It makes a great espresso (depending on the quality and grind of the coffee you use), and along with my Aerolatte, great lattes and cappuccinos as well. I only replaced the gasket twice during the year, so it's cheap and pretty much maintenance-free to use. I bought the 4-cup size, which is perfect for a big mug of latte. It does make 4 reliably sized espressos. I doubt this coffee maker will wear out anytime soon, but I would buy another one in a heartbeat."
5,roots out hidden threats,"I used Norton IS, Norton AV, Trendmicro (which is better than Norton), Microsoft AV, AVG (also excellent), and scanzilla/stopzilla found one more virus than all the others. I have to give it five BIG stars."
1,Why Bother? Just Use Netscape or Mozilla--it's free,"I don't know why anyone would bother paying for pop-up blockers. The latest versions of Mozilla and Netscape web browsers have built-in pop-up blockers. All you have to do is go to either Mozilla.org or Netscape.com and download the software for free. Install, and go into the Preferences and disable the pop-ups. Not only does it work better than any third-party software, it increases the speed of your Internet connection because you don't have addiotnal programs eating into your system memory. Why anyone would waste their money on junkware like this is beyond me.Now if only Internet Explorer would do this..."
1,Go get the Google Toolbar instead,I've been using the Google Toolbar for months now and have found it to be exceptional at stopping pop-ups. Why pay $25 for something you can go download right now for free?
3,"Does what it claims to, but misses the cause.","First of all, this software _does_ stop pop-ups; as can many other completely free programs.However I think the approach of blocking pop-ups is completely missing the point.Why bother killing the individual bee, (the pop-up ad), when you can take out the cause, the bee hive (spyware/adware).In my experience, if you are already protecting yourself from spyware, you shouldn't be getting a lot of pop-ups, unless you are visiting unsavory sites or using file swapping programs. To protect yourself from spyware, there are many fine programs available including; Ad Aware, Spybot, and Spyware Blaster. Try these out and you will see the number of pop-ups you get decline dramatically."
1,Not worth it,Bought Stopzilla. Uninstalled it - caused too many problems and didn't work well besides. Just received another charge for $29.95 for what I don't know... Still trying to reach someone about it...
2,It is not good as seems,"I can not a good anti pops up software so far. Stopzilla indeed suppress many pops up but not all. You have to add websites with pops-up to its black list which takes awhile. It also destroys functional windows in many websites, in your e-mail, etc. Perhaps, it causes script error messages as well. Overall, in my view, it is not worth to use."
3,Good value but...,I was happy with this paper until I got the Ilford Galerie Smooth Gloss paper and it can not compare. Good value at Costco which used to sell it in a pack of 100 for $20 but for eye popping results go with Canon or Ilford glossy paper. More expensive but you get what you pay for.
4,Good for making flip calendars,I use this photo paper to make flip calendars. It is the only product I've found so far that allows me to print glossy photos on one side and the calendar on the back side. The only problem I've had is that the photos tend to fade overtime.
1,Pictures Fading,I printed quite a few pictures for my daughters and after 3 to 4 months the color faded so fast you can barely see the pictures any longer. I have used the HP 4X6 paper and this has never happened with HP.
2,OK for non critical volume printing,"I have never been a big fan of Epson papers, this one isno exception. Has a tendency to deform even under 200 ppi.For unbeatable quality get the HP premium photo matte. Thatpaper rocks !"
1,Don't buy this,"If I had a choice, I would have given this shaver a ZERO. It worked fine for my teenage son for about 6 months when the foil broke. When I called the company, they told me that I had to buy the whole set of foil and blades which cost as much as the shaver (@$40). The replaced foil broke again, almost at the same spot, with the new blades after only 3 months. Now I am trying a different brand. My advise? Check if you can buy individual replacement pieces before you buy the shaver."
1,very disappointed,"I opted for this card, because of the advertised ""free remote""I paid $ 10 extra for shipping to get the ""free remote""I never received the remote - customer service said they triedto deliver, but I wasn't home (excuse me for having to work fora living) and so I'm out the $10 and of course, no remotemost disappointing was the indifferent attitude of customer serviceI'm so sorry I had the audacity to bother them"
1,All Hope Abandon,"I had a previous all-in-wonder on a six year old machine. The picture quality wasn't great but it basically worked. Six months ago I upgraded computers and the new motherboard required a new video card. I went for another all-in-wonder, because I like the notion of saving deskspace.Big mistake! The picture quality of the new ATI unit did not improve over the older one. If anything, it's worse. But the bigger problem is that I can't use it anyway. The sound is intermittent. The picture occassionally freezes and a reboot is required to get rid of the window.To top it off, the support from ATI is incredibly bad. The instructions are often unclear. When they are clear, they're inaccurate. For example, I've been given URLs for web pages that don't exist.I'll never buy another ATI product as long as I live."
5,"WILD, WILD WEST, BETTER THAN THE MOVIE","I LIKE THIS TV SERIES, BETTER THAN THE MOVIE THAT MOVIE WAS A DISASTER IN ALL FRONTS, ROBERT CONRAD IS WONDERFUL, & THE CAST IS GREAT."
5,wonderful memories,"I admit it has been some time since I've seen these shows, having worn the images right off my video tapes. When I was young I would have put James West up on my wall only they didn't publish him in the teen magazines. I confess, I couldn't really afford the magazines and may have missed him inside but if he'd been on the cover I would have found someone's kids to babysit to get the money I needed. I didn't miss an episode. So WHEN will the series be released on DVD? This one I would buy even over the Avengers and Ilya Kuriakin."
3,Portable? Not Really.,"Don't get me wrong, this is a nice DVD player. The only ways to operate it though are by using the car adapter or the wall adapter. Don't ever plan to take this on long flights, because there is no battery in this player. So portable? Maybe, as long as you are near an electrical outlet or are traveling by car and can use the car adapter. Other than not having a battery, i would have given this 5 stars."
2,Lasted only 5 months,"My son received this DVD player as a gift. He loves to be able to watch ""Nemo"" in the car. The picture was great and it worked well for the first month. After that we would have to turn it on and off to get it working. Sometimes I had to push different buttons and play around with it to get it to come on at all. After 4 months it started sometimes working and sometimes playing sound only, no video. Finally, after 5 months of using it it quit completely and now won't come on at all. I do not consider 5 months long enough and I am very disappointed in this model. To be fair, I did leave it in the car during the hot Florida summer pretty much all the time. Also, my son did kick it now and then."
1,Very Bad!!!!!,"BAD DVD PLAYER. Stop working after a month. Returned it and got a new same one, it still works terrible. Stops, freeze and had to spent half an hour trying to turn it on everytime. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE."
1,Video quit working after 30 days,I bought this July 24th and loved it. Today is September 8th; I am 8 days out of my warranty and the video stopped working. Sound is fine. Video is there but you have to look very close it is so dim. Very disapointed.
5,Perfect little DVD players for the kids!!!,"I bought 2 of these specifically for use in the car and the hotel room on our spring break. They are perfect! Reasonably priced to begin with, I was amazed at the value of what I actually got, which included AC adapters, DC adapters, a cable to connect 2 or more units (to watch the same movie), remote controls and cases that attached to the back of the headrests in my car.The picture is crisp, the sound clear and the unit perfectly sized. The kids watched them in the cases in the car and then in bed in the hotel. The cases were well-designed to hold the unit securely while allowing access to all of the controls and the dual headphone jacks. The unit can also be used with video game players.I absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a decent product at a great price!"
4,Another solid effort,"The story is summarised elsewhere. The plot is well thought out and executed. I like Harvey's skills as a writer. So why not 5? I felt it lacked pace at times. There were niggles in the wrap up, it was all a bit too neat and I am not sure it was consistent with what I knew of the characters."
2,Good Harvey Standalone,"This is one of John Harvey's better books. The standalone works for me because I've never been able to get into the Charlie Resnick novels for some reason. This, however, is an interesting and suspenseful work."
5,hmmm... a little stealing here.,"I should probably let you know that this is the game ""Swarm"" by reflexive. I have no clue why camaj entertainment would rip this game, put thier label on it, name it galactic swarm, and go sell it for a buck or less. you usually buy this game for $20.00 on some game sites. even though the box is different, it is %100 swarm. on to the game!the game itself rocks hard. it's kinda like a ""astroids"" but with a bigger field, funky aliens, and some lasers/missle/bombs. your supposed to collect some element called EZT. you move with your mouse and fire with your mouse. it's a really fun game. get it foo'! Still dont know why camaj says its thier own, it even says ""REFLEXIVE INTERTAINMENT"" as it loads up. (by the way, if your not willing to spend a buck witoust trying the game, go download a demo!)"
4,A very good overview of Corona with much new information,"This book brings together quite a bit of new information about early satellite imaging in general and Corona in particular. It covers many interesting political, technical, military and personal aspects of the subject. The author combines information already in the public domain with new information from sources who have spoken with him now that the program has officially come out of the ""black world"". It is heartily recommended for anyone interested in the development of military space technology but is also a fine source for those who are mainly interested in Cold War politics. Hats off to anyone reading this who was involved in Corona. You folks did a lot to make sure the good guys won!"
5,An exciting and thrilling book. Very well written,"Do you like spies? Do you like mysteries? If you do, read this book. IT is packed with fun facts and a history that will blow your mind!"
5,A Home Library Gem,"""Aging Without Growing Old"" is a great addition to the reference section of any home library. I found it helpful in determining my personal vitamin and mineral supplement routine."
5,Unique and beautiful!,"I came across one of Don Hinely's songs by chance while listening to Pandora.com and immediately sought out his work on Amazon. Fans of minimalist music will love this unique seasonal album, although I honestly think his version of Pachebel's canon stands out as earnest and original. In short, this is just a fun, really cool CD."
4,Good beginner book on Emacs,"This is good beginner book for anyone who is un-initiated to the world of Emacs. Since this book is in a tutorial format like other Sams Teach Yourself books, one can read through this book pretty fast and get up and running using the power of Emacs very quickly. The author does a good job of introducing the reader to many of the powerful functions of emacs and also contantly mentions ways to customize the various functions.One of the sources of irritation while reading the book is that the author refers too many times to the libraries on the CD rather than the generic functions available in Emacs itself. However, this does get the reader accustomed to the idea of customizing Emacs, which is what makes Emacs such a powerful editor. There is also a introductory chapter on Lisp, which should suffice most beginners."
3,"Simple minds, simple plot.","The idea is this - in the future great battles between civilizations are no longer allowed. Glory, honor, rewards, treaties, ownership of planets, are all decided now by a game. Spaceships fight each other and those who win gains everything for their side. you even insert a coin to start the engines! Too bad the Terra Team suck.Now Earth has gone back, a thousand years, to get the best fighter pilot of all times. With her at the head of her team, all girls like herself, she and the Earth can't lose.I am not sure who the anime is pointed at. Girls? Boys? It seems to bounce all only the place. One second cute, one second the leader of the Red Snappers is jiggling her boobs in your face. It is in fact two small three episode OVAs put onto one disc and while it has some interesting extras without any real plot it's only worth watching if you have a cold or it is raining outside.Get used if you get it at all."
5,Pleasing Gift,"I got this rack for my mother as a Christmas gift. The styling is one I liked and the received product matched that of the image. The straps are of high quality and wrap around the outside of the frame, making it particularly strong when in use. The finish is even, rich and smooth. It was beautiful and she absolutely loved it. I will note that in my case the shipping box was damaged pretty badly when it arrived (crushed on one end and a large hole), but there was no damage on the product."
5,Sturdy & nice looking!,"There are a lot of cheap luggage racks out there! This isn't one of them. I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a luggage rack, but I wanted something that would look nice and stand up to a lot of use. We travel quite a bit and there's almost always a suitcase on top of this rack.This rack is attractive, it holds heavy suitcases without creaking or falling apart, and it didn't cost me an arm and a leg... what more could you want?"
5,Fun game for two!,"Great game, easy to learn the basic rules but changing strategies make it still fun after play after many, many times. Would absolutely recommend this game!"
2,Much too tight,I bought these for my husband in the size that should have fit him but they were so tight even I couldn't wear them. Seemed to be well made and looked very nice but I'd suggest buying a size or two bigger than you think you will need.
5,Read the fine print,I bought this used from Amazon and have reviewed the seller also. I am learning that the fine print is very important at Amazon. In this case ONLY the lid was for sale which the seller clearly stated on his site but not on the Amazon description. It was exactly what I wanted; it meant I didn't have to replace the whole teapot when I just broke the lid. I have bought abridged books and then been disapointed because I hadn't read all the description. Reader reviews are wonderful if you actually read through all of them. I've avoided many mistakes since then.
4,"Dortmunder, funny as always.","John Dortmunder is a burglar. While on what should have been an easy job he's caught by the pistol-toting homeowner and gets caught. That's bad enough, but the homeowner, wealthy Max Fairbanks, adds insult to injury when he claims that Dortmunder's lucky ring actually belongs to him. Big mistake. Dortmunder vows to get the ring back no matter what which leads to a series of funny capers where Max Fairbanks loses more and more wealth until the slam-bang finish in Las Vegas.I've been reading the Dortmunder novels for years and they never disappoint. They are always funny with a little cockeyed slant to them that Donald Westlake is famous for. They are just fun books to read and I'd recommend any of them."
4,I can't wait to read more about my friends...,"I wish I could have John Dortmunder over for dinner. Westlake creates such a likeable, believable character. All the characters - they became my friends as I read, I rooted for them, I wished I was on the caper with them. Excellent storytelling - brilliant characters."
3,Good Comic Crime.,"I'll read anything that Westlake can crank out about his eccentric gang of professional criminals, even though the series has lost some of the zaniness and hilarious ineptitude of the characters in some his earlier efforts (like The Hot Rock). In this book, Dortmunder and his crew go head to head with an arrogant tycoon. Donald Westlake invented the genre of ""Comic Crime"" and never disappoints."
5,Works wonders for head and neck pain,"I've used the Oriental Neck Therapy since they became available and swear by mine. I suffer from migraines and have found that using this device for five minutes a day radically reduces the frequency of my headaches. It also works wonders to help avoid pinched nerves and other extraneous back pain. I bought one for my parents, who have had the same success with their Oriental Neck Therapy. It's the next best thing to daily chiropractic treatment and massage!"
4,Great stuff from Harlow.,"Just as the cover shows, a very young Ismael Miranda does lead singing on this album. This 1969 release includes several great tracks including ""Oiga Mi Guaguanco"" and ""Guasasa."" ""Lo Que Quieras Hacer"" starts off a bit slow, but picks it up after the chorus followed by a fantastic piano solo by Harlow and nice trumpets. What peculiar is the use of what seems to be an electric piano on several tracks, which give it a certain funky sound, although I'm not completely thrilled about this. The standout track for me has to be ""Guaguasa"" with a heavy sound, great piano and trumpet playing. I also like ""La Revolucion"" because of its lyrical content, a cry for peace. Overall the album is not outstanding, but still solid. A worthy addition to your collection."
5,Harlow has got the funk!,"i cannot believe this only has one review. i do not buy or listen to many spanish albums, but larry harlow can bring down the house. i grew up in miami (and still live in south florida). so i grew up with all this type of music back in the day. if you like old school salsa (ie celia cruz, ruben blades, willie colon, hector lavoe etc) you might want to pick this up."
3,Good book but First Edition was MUCH better,"I've just received a copy of the second edition in hopes that the authors or editors had found a way to improve on an already useful book.Unfortunately, the most striking difference is that the new edition has about half the content. I'm planning on returning the new edition because there are plenty of other, less expensive cursory books about herbs for pets."
3,"Great herb book, but . . .","Very thorough description of the different herbs and their uses, but the book is organized by herb. It would be much more helpful if it were organized by malady, and then listed which herbs would help."
4,Very informative,I work in a business that sells all natural herbal remedies for both people and pets and this book has been very helpful and informative in educating both myself and my employees about the herbs in our products.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about how to treat your pet naturally.
4,Love it!!,"I love the song seein' red!! it is in grind, it plays when they skate the park!! i have been looking for this for a long time!! finally i found it.. well i am going to go! cya!Love -??-"
2,"OK Camera, Pretty Bad Support","I used this little cam to setup a video conference with my brother for Thanksgiving, and it worked ok. But when I upgraded by computer to Windows 2000 Professional, here's the Ezonics response:> We do not have drivers for the EZcam USB and the Windows 2000 Professional OS. We have no plans at this time to have drivers for the Ezcam USB and the Windows 2000 Professional OS -- EzonicsIf you have Win2K, or plan on installing it, stay away from the Ezonics products."
3,EZ Cam Pro (USB),"First of all I would give this product normal 4.5 stars, because it is a really good webcam for this price, but I got problems with the driver, which was sent with the camera. So I had to download a new one, to get it run. But if this don't mind you, you can buy it confident."
4,"Good Book, Entertaining","Good book. Likeable characters and decent plot. There were a few things that I would like to see wrapped up in another book. The author never addressed why one of the children doesn't talk. This was the first book I've read by Karen Hawkins and although it's not one of my top 10 books, it was good enough that I will read her next one."
4,Great for the genre,"I'm not always into ""regency romances"" because I generally prefer my romance novels to be a little spicier. But this was a really good book. I was interested in the characters and genuinely liked them. While there really isn't much action beyond kissing, there is a lot of steamy build up which makes me wish for a Greyley of my own! Great book."
4,Her Best Yet!!! 4 & 1/2 stars for this one!!!,"Hawkins has written an engaging, beautiful story...unlike the others, this one has intrigue and memorable characters, not sappy ones. I loved Anna and Anthony such personalities! However Anna's grandfather stole my heart...sweet and cunning old man. The children are cute, especially the youngest one and they had me laughing outloud!!! Didn't give the five stars because I wanted to see what happened with Richard, he never spoke, I wanted to see his grandmother exposed and thrown out on her ear, and I wanted to see what happened to the other couple???!!! The ending needed a little tweaking, that's all. All in all I loved it, this one is your best Julia! Keep it up!!!"
3,Not that memorable,"An affair to remember??? I don't think so. This book had a good, though typical, storyline. Anthony becomes the guardian of five young mischievious children whom he apparently doesn't get along with. He can't keep a governess employed for more than two weeks at time. After he goes through many he hires the best governess, Anna Thraxton. She comes to the estate and gets the children in line and everyone else too.This just wasn't the story I thought it would be. Anna and Anthony had sparks flying off the pages but it wasn't enough to keep me riveted to the pages to see what would happen. The children kept the story entertaining, along with Anna's grandfather. He was such a sweet old man. This story just seemed to drag by until the last few chapters. This is much like the other Hawkins book I read, The Seduction of Sara.Sorry I couldn't agree with everyone else who apparently seemed to love this story. I just don't think it's a book I'll remember."
1,This is NOT Scorpio Rising from Austin TX USA,This is NOT Scorpio Rising from Austin TX USAThis is NOT Scorpio Rising from Austin TX USAThis is NOT Scorpio Rising from Austin TX USA
3,But it's pretty good,"Some photos would have been nice, but then I'm sure the book would have cost much much more, and the price is one nice thing about it. I also didn't have any of the problems of the first reviewer- it was all clear in my edition. I found some Austrian wines to go with the dishes at www.winemonger.com and had a great party!"
2,Suspicious,"I have done a lot of research on NDE's so when I saw the people in hell burning in flames I became suspicious, Usually when someone says they saw fire and brim stone it's coming from the religious right. I have read hundreds of NDE's and no one has ever claimed seeing this. I thought it was odd that there wasn't one review of this movie so I did a search on ""The Final Frontier by Johan Sturm"". Turns out there is a Christian web site where you can watch it for free if you feel the need."
3,you get what you pay for,"It works pretty good although it has some problems with shuffle and you can't read it in the daylite, the worse thing is the directions, their bad.Sam Mi."
5,Complicated,"I would give 5+ for the servvice.They really care about customers.Mp3 is pretty good,however before using it I highly recommend to download online sansa program so that you can upload and set latest vorsion on your mp3.otherwise you are gonna have problems with mp3:it will randomly stop playing,or become unable of turning it on. Visit sansa forum for more information."
1,Sansa express-WorldWide Distributors,"I bought two of these players, and one of stopped working just a few days after I received it.I tried everything that I know or found on the web(forums,sansa support,) but I have not gotten any positive result. The reseller(WorldWide Distributors ) has offered me to pay the shipping back to them, but as soon as I asked how am I going to receive the corresponding payment, they just quitted touch with me.As a result I took the decision of not having a business with them anymore."
4,"Ijunk, eat your heart out!","I'll admit I'm biased. I prefer simple, inexpensive, drag-drop-done players like the Sansa. As one of of those, this device is a champ. It's quick to load and charge and the micro sd card, fm radio, and voice recorder make it that much more useful. It's added plus that I can pop the cards between this device and most mp3 compatible phones.The controls are admittedly tiny and take a little bit of fumbling.If you're the type that leaves an mp3 player on shuffle, It's not a deal breaker.I'd give it a five if it allowed more than one play list,but it's a terrific device for it's price range!"
1,Looks good ....But,"I really was excited to get this unit. I had planned to have it for my upcoming travel. I got it on time. I unpacked it and the instructions were easy to read and understand. I plugged the unit into my usb port and noted the easy to read display, very clear and good definition.I set my timer for 2 hours as it said to charge it before use. Came back when the timer dinged and unplugged it and turned it on , nothing, reread the instructions and tried again, nothing.I thought perhaps the port was bad on the laptop. CHANGED laptops and plugged it into the new laptop and the screen on the unit was dark. Charged it for 30 minutes. Unplugged it and tried to turn it on. NOTHING. I have had 3 different usb mp3 players and they are all the same it appears. Shabby.I will take my IPOD with me instead, I urge you to look for a higher dollar unit. This is trash and that is where it is now.Terrance L Smith"
1,okay until it dies,"This is a nice size, and I liked that it could be plugged into my car stereo's USB port and played from there. It has a pre-set and customizable equalizer, which helped with the earphones. They weren't bad, but I wanted more bass than they could put out. I don't like the way I had to scroll through the many menus to get what I wanted, but I became familiar with it pretty quickly. All in all, I was happy with it UNTIL IT STOPPED WORKING yesterday. I've had it barely a month with VERY light use - probably used it only 8 times. I used it yesterday, but then it wouldn't turn on later. I figured maybe the battery had run out somehow (it had power when I turned it off). But now it won't charge. When I plug it into the USB on the computer, it doesn't start charging. I can't turn it on...it will flash the Sansa name briefly and turn off. It's kaput. Maybe the internal battery died, but nothing I can do about that."
1,The USB does not recognize this device,"Not even three months later, and it is not working now. This thing was annoying from day one. Mixing up tracks on albums, hiding others, it was never very coherent when it came to hearing what I wanted to hear. Quite frustrating, and thirty dollars gone. Thank you Sansa!!!Save your money, this thing is cheap for a reason. The only reason why people are saying they like it is because they just got it."
2,Sansa Express needs a makeover!,"This item has a horrible user interface; the controls are just wacky as Sansung's devices are VERY intuitive (but they have their own flaws). The equalizer is just for show. The 'random' feature will never remember where you left off, so you only ever get to listen to the same 10% of the songs stored as it plays the SAME exact list each time it's powered on. I guess it's OK for the money, but very frustrating to use. I won't buy another."
1,Ughhh,"Peice of crap.No play lists, impossible to update unless you want a hassle. No good software that is out of date and unsupported by the company. Withing 4 days of barley using it it froze on me then shut off and became a brick. Dead. Looked on several forum for advice and no help, went to old forum threads and found out how to turn it back on and another way to update. Bricked again. Now nothing works.Oh by the way, the advice i followed for updating another way was on their official site by an official staff member with the company.HA.I will not reccomend this to anyone nor buy again.ProSoundSizeBatteryLooksConsEverything else."
1,(in this case) you get what you pay for,"Pros:Small, Portable, Lightweight, Good sound.Cons:The micro chip section never did work correctly, The neck attachment is a joke for any type of active use (walking / jogging), It stopped working after 1 month.Final analysis:I guess this would be fine to record business meetings or sermons at church, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for a listening device while doing an activity. It is too fragile for this type of use, and the neck rope is at best a pain in the neck (no pun intended), and at worst a fatality (watch ID or movie ""Hang Em High"" for a better explanation of what I mean). The micro SD slot will work on your computer, but not for listening on the device (what's up with that?).This device should perhaps not be sold by this company as it gives the company a bad name. It may be good for some uses, but not for what I use it for."
1,avoid product at all costs.,"I received this product the week before last, and was rather impressed for around an hour. At that point, I decided to do what any good nerd does and update the firmware from Sandisk.Sandisk does not provide direct download links for firmware. They only provide an updater, which is fine. However, this updater does not tell you what the new firmware does. it installed the firmware, and rebooted the device. At that point, the 2gb microsd card I had purchased to go along with it was no longer recognized, even though it worked in my cell phone and in my card reader.Sandisk's support was nearly useless in fixing this issue. After seeing numerous reports of problems with this device, I have returned it to amazon and I am hoping to get a refund, because I do not want another sandisk product."
4,Miss Mines,"I bought 2 of these; 1GB and 2GB. Works great. Very easy to carry around, batter life was longer than expected (6hrs), plays by songs, artist, genre, etc. Easy to upload songs onto MP3 without have to use a primary source like ITunes. Great Products"
2,Poor Battery Life,"Product is just okay. The firmware seems to lock up from time to time, and since you can't remove the battery the only way for it to reset is to wait for the internal battery to run out. Not the best purchase I have made. Next time I'll pay a little more for better quality."
1,Worst product ever.,"When I first came across this product I thought what a sensible alternative to the apple nano, hey it even has an FM receiver. I was even willing to overlook the one comment posted by another amazon user claiming the product was a dud. Well I am here to confirm that review, that this bit of silcon and plastic isn't worth the raw materials it is made from. While loading songs on the flash drive was easy, getting the unit to even turn on is not. It DOES not work as advertised, it DOES not work period. Had I the inclination and time I would have returned it. To be honest had I bought it from a store and not via the web I would have returned it immediately. Instead I am out the $45 or so I spent.Please don't waste your money on this piece of c&@p. And I only gave it one star because it won't allow you to give zero stars."
2,crashy little bugger eats own battery,"I got one of these to give out as a gift and one for myself - both the 2 gig version - both crashed enough that i never gave it out as a gift. When it crashes it doesen't reset, it just has to sit unresponsive for days and one of them came back to life when I pluged it into USB after a while. It crashed attempting to read a Microsd card - it crashed in the middle of listening to the radio - several crash while listening to mp3s. So, pretty crashy. The other thing is that the battery sucks itself dry if the unit is off but you were listening to the radio before you turn it off - so I always have to go into the menu and play an MP3 before I turn the thing off. Pros is that it cost about as much as a usb 2 gig stick and gets decent radio reception. The blue light looks great in the daytime but is awful at night."
3,New to MP3 world,"The SanDisk Express 2GB MP3 player is my first experience with an MP3 player. I'm amazed at the technology that allows me to easily carry audio files, listen to and record FM stations, and even record my spoken notes.I purchased it after reading several reviews of MP3 players, looking for something that would allow me capacity to carry numerous files with a purchase price in the $50 - $60 range.The ear-plugs aren't comfortable for long periods of listening, but the jack accomodates padded headsets, so I can get by."
1,loved it at first,"I bought the Sandisk Sana Express with 2g. For the first 3 weeks it was wonderful, just what I wanted. Then went to turn it on and NOTHING. Recharged for 3 hrs. Nothing. Call the support desk. Must use email for help. Never did even get to email. Kept returning me to the log on page and then refused to let me log on. I returned the player today. It really was what I wanted if it just would have worked."
4,Needed very portable music,This product is exactly what I need for a cross-country motorcycle ride. I have limited space and this fits the bill. It's hold all the music I will need and without a bunch of cords for downloading. Just plug it into the computer and download. Very easy to use. Now I'll have all my favorite tunes along with me on the ride.
2,Okay if you get a good one,"Apparently Sansa is dropping the ball on quality control or is farming out production to a low end third party. From the reviews I read before purchasing I agree that the device is an excellent value IF IT LASTS. I had mine for maybe six weeks and then it died. Would not turn on at all. I bought one for a niece of mine and hers would not play for more than 30 seconds before shutting down. This is right out of the box! I took mine apart for fun of it and the construction and design seems fine and sophisticated. So apparently there's a quality control issue at the plant. If you luck out and get a good one, it's a great little player. But so far for me they're 0 for 2."
2,Software for Dummies and Sandisk failed,"With horrible software design, awkward button positioning and bizarre crashes, this Sansa Express made me realize why companies are struggling to displace Apple.I wanted a cheap USB style MP3 player and I got a nightmare, even with the newest firmware.Buy the Sony USB style MP3 player. It's designed much better but has no microSD slot."
1,Dont buy the express,I bought this Express for my daughter for Christmas. It worked great for about 1 week. Were having the same problems as everyone else. If you go to the sandisk website you will see an overwhelming amount of people with Expresses that dont work. It wont turn on I tried the hard reset and it turns out there is a firmware update. I am on dial up - (no other option where I live) and it will take waaaay to long to DL the patch. I bought this based on the reveiws which were good mostly. I wish I had the foresight to look at the sandisk webboards to see what kind of probs they had. Hopefully we will be able to exchange for a different one. As for the Co I bought it from J&R. They shipped very quickly no probs with them.
3,"Nice, Neat Little Mp3 Player","I recieved this player in good condition and it worked right away after i charged it for almost two hours for the first try. It is very easy to put music on it with the drag and drop or copy and paste options. I however was so excited to use the player that i placed my memory card with close to five hundreds songs in it. Unregrettably the player wiped my card clean, no more songs. the player automatically formated ny memory card. I was so devastated.But other than that, it was awesome. Should mention that it was bought for my four year old son who aleady knows how to function it properly."
2,It's got issues,"I like the fact that it's got a built-in USB connector, and that it plays a variety of different audio formats, but that's about it. It does some very annoying things - like for example, it often doesn't remember settings, so every time you turn it on, you have to adjust the volume to your liking. Also, if you like to use shuffle, as many people do, you'll have to turn shuffle on every time you use the player. It won't remember. I never got it to work with Rhapsody. The worst part is, it just died on me a few days ago, after only having it for a few months. Won't turn on. No reset button or anything. It's just dead."
4,Good enough for the price,"If you look for a practical, good and cheap MP3 player this is for you. Good sound (not great though), connects as mass storage device so you just need to drag and drop you mp3 files by the windows explorer. Recharge is very fast and the battery holds well the device for about 3 hours.The buttons not always works as they should and looks fragile but for the price is a very good gadget and no doubtly is much better than ipod shuffle."
1,Avoid!,"I purchased this product, charged it, downloaded songs onto it, attempted to play it, screen went black and hasn't turned back on since. Waste of money!"
2,"decent player, but seems kinda buggy","Pros:- compact size (although it could've been a bit flatter/thinner)- sound quality was nice (i'm not an audiophile btw)- good priceCons:- it just randomly goes off by itself- the shuffle option is kinda lame because it plays almost the same sequence of songs all the time.- included headphones are somewhat cheap, might want to just skip the them and get your own"
5,Satisfied,"Small, but powerful. Just what I needed at a great price. Key features for me were the USB interface and power recharging, along with manual file management... without special software or synchronization."
3,Good Value,"I got this because I had a gift card to use and so had to pay very little OOP for it. I like it because it is very small, has a built-in battery, and has that MicroSD slot. I guess as long as they keep making memory in MicroSD format in greater capacity, this unit should be usable until they stop making batteries for it! I got a 2GB MicroSD card for it, with a different gift card. You definitely need to run the SW update when you get it, just like you do with any updateable piece of gear."
4,Pretty Good Deal,"I really like my Sansa Express, except for one thing. You can't create playlists. There is something called the ""Go List"" but I like to have a few options. The sound quality is pretty good with the standard headphones. It's easy to use and super easy to upload songs onto. Even my technology numb boyfriend can figure it out!"
5,good mp3 player,"I like the sandisk sansa express because it's cheap and still a good product. This seller had to good of a price to pass up. Good product, excellent service."
3,Headphone jack problem right out of the box.,"The MP3 player works fine but mine has a loose connection in the headphone jack. I should send it back but I'm so busy that the last thing I have time to do is send back a cheap MP3 player. In any case, I'll just deal with it."
4,Versatile!,Great little 2 GB music player with built-in radio can hang around your neck with a stereo earbud lanyard! (See Sennheiser's good quality units -Sennheiser CXL 400 Stereo Headphones with Integrated LanyardandSennheiser MXL51 Stereo Headphones with Integrated Lanyardsold separately.) It still finds time to be a USB storage device.
2,waste of money,I had one before and had no problems so I upgraded to a 2GB. Radio freezes and no sound will come out. Power on can freeze and you have no way of turning device on and have to wait util it decided it is the right time.Item freezes up too much and then not only does Amazon and the Factory Depot give you the run around for a refund but they want you to get confirmation form sansdisk something is wrong with the item. So a refund isnext to impossible. Most of the items going out now form Sans for the Express are refurbished items!! Buy your electronics at a store!!!
4,A good option,"I purchased four of these so I can put books on them for my mother in law. We found even with her poor vision she can read the screen to select chapters, a feature not in my old shuffle and at a good price. They work very good, can be loaded by my MAC or PC and have a fine FM radio. Give them a try."
4,First one didn't work ...,"The first one that I received did not work properly; the forward button would not work, so I returned it. The second one worked properly. They should also tell you that they install half-a-dozen sample songs on it before it arrives; I was beginning to think that the first one was ""used"" because it already had songs on it, and it wouldn't work properly. It's a pretty decent MP3 player but it's impossible to see the screen when I'm outdoors, even though the screen is crisp and bright indoors."
3,3 starz,"The player is ok. Not very good, not very bad.The plus of sansa is its reasonable price and its many functionz. Voice recorder, radio, radio recorder. Battery last long and be charged fast.The biggest minus of the sansa is in its songs locating. the screen only have 3 lines, so we can only see 3 songs name at a time. without ""fast scroll-down"" function like ipod, sansa still take lot of time (and a bit of effort) when you have to keep pressing ""down"" button to find the exact song you want.One more thing Sansa better let user make/edit playlist and information of songs in Windows. Once music is synced into sansa with media player, you can't edit song info anymore. Also, When open sansa with computer, I don't like the way it organize music into artist's name folders."
1,Arrived in missing parts..,"My son needed a bike for a summer camp and I decided to get this online.First one came but there was nothing to fasten the seat and no connecting pole for the handle.What a bummer..And I had to return the item and received the second one...Lo and behold!The second one came with the missing parts again...I am returning it again for the third replacement, my son did not get to use the bike for the camp and I would like towarn those who might consider buying the item, make sure you are willing to do this iteration for a couple of times.."
3,It's so-so,"Well this item is a bit of a disappointment, it's kinda small, and none of the batarangs are detachable which though not necessary, would be a nice little touch. The ends of the wings of the two small batarangs are a little uneven. It's good but not great."
4,A very good record,"I'm going to dock this record one star because, in all honesty, maybe five stars should be reserved for the truly great, timeless records, and this isn't Midnight Marauders or Paid In Full or anything like that... but it is another example of Scarub's great lyricism, his spotless flow, etc. The beats are awesome. Scarub gives you stuff to think about, but he doesn't shove it down your throat. A rising star."
5,This fool did it again,"Scarub's first album ""a fact of the matter"" was probably one of the dopest hip-hop albums in a long time. I didn't think that Heavenbound would be as good as his debut. Damn, this album is so good. It's different and has a more messages and when I heard it I was fascinated again. This fool is so dope! I reccomend it to anyone, and if you don't have his first one get that too."
1,I can not understand how it even got published as a Children's book,"Although it is a moving book, it is from a very mature perspective and totally inappropriate for young children. As the mom of a 4yo typically developing child and an 8yo with autism we read a lot of books on feelings and emotions, and I am accustomed to taking uncomfortable topics head on, but this was horrifically bad for that age bracket. I kept hoping there was some redeeming value at the end, but it doesn't. I have never returned a book so quickly in my life.If it were a book that was clearly aimed at adults, I can see it having some value, but is so inappropriate for kids that I think I would be more comfortable showing them pornography. (well, that might be overstated, but it is just as inappropriate as pornography). If you are looking at it from an adult, artistic perspective...beautiful, moving, and deeply sad, but it shockingly bad for children."
1,Inappropriate for children,"I am a Doctor of Psychology student specializing in work with children. I help to do our program's major research and teaching on children and adolescents. We borrow this book from the library every semester (because we don't want to contribute to its sales!) to show classes the developmentally INAPPROPRIATE things that are out there for children. This is NOT a good book for children in that the pictures are disturbing (though some kids do like them) but the words, in particular, are beyond the emotional maturity of children. Personally, I think it's a bit scary even as an adult, but the best word I can use to describe it from a young child's perspective is ""burdensome."" Only adolescents have the capacity to deal with something so dreary, and frankly, even then, I'd rather show them something with a message of hope behind the sadness. It's crazy that this book received an award--apparently those who decided were not child psychologists."
1,Deceptive photo... ultra cheep product... Junk!,This product is requires assembly.. is not painted as shown in photo.. looks like something your kid made as a school project... not worth the time and trouble much less the money.
4,letter holder,I bought this product because i really needed a bill organizer and it works great once i put it together.
3,Striking a blow for feminism.,"With ""Doctora Duran,"" Joana proves that young, slender women are just as capable of writing cliche-filled narcocorridos as paunchy fortysomething men. So in honor of this groundbreaking step, I suggest ""The Joana Duran Drinking Game."" Everyone knocks back a shot of tequila every time they spot a cliche in ""Doctora Duran."" Let's see-the song features 1) A Chevy Suburban 2) Double entendre (on the word ""medicine"") 3) Mexican states of Jalisco and/or Michoacan 4) Bragging about never getting caught by Customs 5) Singer telling us where she was born. That's a good start, but I'm sure you can do better, especially if you know a bit about music theory.Anyway, at least she sings with verve, and the ranchera title track is a fun song with a lot of potential. But if she is studying medicine for real as her PR suggests, she would do well to have a little more mature attitude about drugs."
5,A Very Promising New Artist,"Inspired by the deep sad and touching movie ""Mask"" (the 1985's film based on a true story, not Jim Carrey's heroic fantasy), Jens Lekman's second EP is not only a tribute to ""Rocky Dennis"", also a solid sophomore work since his breakthrough debut ""Maple Leaves"". Among this EP, I like ""Rocky Dennis Farewell Song to the Blind Girl"" the most. With the slow and melancholy melody, Jen's rich tenor voice captured my heart effortlessly. This is the music you can hold the repeat key on your CD player."
3,A diffrent out look,"When I first started this book, I had no clue what to expect. The title tells you very little, and the short blurb on the back isn't much help either. Books about people growing up are generally something I find interesting though, so I gvave it a whirl. The book is fairly interesting, and you are motivated to read it, but a bit let down after you've finished it. A good book for teens."
5,"Magnifcent, to say the least","A wonderful, warm, authoritative biogrphaphy. It is obvious the Hammerstein family cooperatied fully with the author. The author is meticulous in his research. I advise next reading the autobiography of Richard Rodgers, and then reading the suburb biography of Stephen Soundheim, to whit, ""Stephen Sondheim : A Life"" by Meryle Secrest. Ockie was a great man...a man who never in his life visited a whore house and yet tried to write lyrics for a musical that was about a prostitute (i.e., the unsuccessful musical ""PipeDream""). It fascinating how this book reprints some of the correspondance where John Steinbeck argues, in vein, for Oscar to stop sanitizing PipeDream to the point where the audience never knew the woman character was a lady of the evening. The book tells the story of every musical Hamerstein wrote lyrics for. I found myself buying CD cast albums as I encountered the story of each in the biography. The book is interesting and never boring, not even once."
2,NOT the TV series,"I absolutely loved the Captain Tylor TV series, and I couldn't wait to see the OVAs. Unfortunately, I was badly disappointed. There is a plot, but half of the series is taken up by side stories about various characters that do nothing to further the main action. Moreover, Captian Tylor just wasn't the same hilarious, happy-go-lucky guy I had come to know and love. Though he hides it well...to me, it almost seemed like the Irresponsible Captian had become...responsible.Go ahead and watch the OVAs, if you want. They're not horrible. Just don't expect them to be like the TV series."
2,The price is wrong.,"I own this book. It is very small so it might fit in a shirt pocket. If you want a devotional book for ten bucks, consider buying ""Day by Day with the Early Church Fathers"" (also ava. from Amazon), a real bargain."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the Briel Artemis for my husband, for Christmas, but it's now on its way back to Amazon. I don't know whether the one we had was faulty in some way, but the espresso it produced was very weak and tasted more like coffee made in a coffee press (like the Bodum). We have had an old Gaggia for years and the espresso and cappuccino made in the Briel do not compare with that from the Gaggia. Although we got a nice crema on top of the espresso, the flavor just wasn't there. Very disappointing!I had taken some time to review many kinds of machines in this price range before choosing the Briel but I guess we'll just keep looking for an alternative for our very old Gaggia."
2,Cannot recommend it,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but my wife is right. Our cheap Krups Bravo machine works better that the expensive Artemis I bought to replace it. The Krups makes 4 shots at a time, and they come out a lot richer, and there is no supervision of the machine to avoid making the shots too weak. Also, the steamer really does not make a very nice froth. The Krups folks have that process down much better, I'm sorry to say.If you have a warranty issue, like I do, don't expect any help. They won't even answer my emails.If you're going to spend this much money, buy the higher-end Krups. I hate it when the wife is right!! =)"
2,Not worth it. Buy a different brand.,"Simply put, I bought this machine, and I recommend spending your money elsewhere. Don't think that long warranty is worth anything, because the company won't return your calls or answer your emails.Buy one of the brands that are more reputable."
1,1/72 scale model of a Type VIIC U-Boat makes a dull mantel display,"Revell's 1/72 scale model kit of the German WWII Type VIIC submarine is an undemanding job for an adult modeler.After the two halves of the sub are glued together, there's little left to assemble and paint. Furthermore, it makes a dull mantel-piece--not Revell's fault. On the positive side, the made-in-Germany kit holds tight tolerances"
5,great book,"this is a great book, it is really neat that all 4 volumes are in one book. it was a great price for these volumes"
3,A Cumbersome Masterpiece,"This single volume edition of Darwin's four most noted books masterfully brings together his pioneering analysis and conclusions. However, in a practical sense, the 4-lb volume is difficult to read. I would prefer four volumes, preferably paperbacks."
5,Bought for a friend,I bought this as a gift for a friend who shares my passion for science and learning. He was incredibly please and happy with this book.
4,Good reads,This book set was a gift and I was told well liked. I would purchase this set again. Also the service was excellent!
3,Colorless dyeing,This is a retread of a much older book that I have in my collection of dye books. The illustrations are not clear. The instructions are fine.
3,"Affordable, but needed updated software","The cable was very affordable, but I hed to find a v4.36 download to make the software compatible w/ a V3xx."
5,An engaging tribute and fascinating wealth of insight,"The Volume 23, Number 2, Quarterly, 1996 Alaska Geographic issue, Native Cultures In Alaska offers an informed and informative introduction into the daily life of modern-day Native Americans of Alaska. Full-color photographs and a variety of vignettes and anecdotes about tribes such as the Aleuts, Yup'ik, Tsimshian, and more make Native Cultures In Alaska an engaging tribute and fascinating wealth of insight into enduring cultures and traditions that would enhance any personal, school, or community library Native American Studies collection."
1,Should have stayed with PhotoSuite III,"All the slick advertising led me to purchase version 5 and I still have not been able to use it. It would not function at all after the download so I emailed the technical support staff. They responded with instructions to manually register four different files, uninstall the program then reinstall it. The results were that now the program opens but none of its features function. Their email stated ""If the information provided does not resolve your issue simply reply to this email."" How long will this email interchange go on and when will this program start working? I expected, for the money, a program that would function at first try as every other program that I have ever downloaded has."
1,Junk Charger/Jumper,"Bought one new, used it one time. It then sat for 8 or 9 months before I charged the internal battery to be ready for use. It would not take a charge no matter how many times I tried to charge it.It should have charged because the flashlight still had enough power to light dimly. That means it should have taken a charge.I used to build and race cars in my younger days so I have knowledge of how this works, or is supposed to."
4,250+ Activitiesand Ideas for Developing Literacy Skills,"excellent book, recommend for teachers, librains, etc"
3,lot of copy from Gloria,"I bought this OK read ,but then I bought Gloria Swanson's memiors found Axel had taken huge section of his book from Gloria's memiors,just buy her memiorsget everything thats here plus more"
3,Short annonation of William T. Ellis' biography on Billy Sunday,"Written by the authorization of Sunday at the prime of his evangelistic career, this 432 page work covers the life of Sunday with the majority of the text focusing on Sunday`s evangelistic messages, quoting large sections and complete texts of Sunday`s sermons. Sermons are not indexed or included as appendixes."
1,Wobby hinges on expensive mirror,"Easy to install, but mirror hinges wobble and mirror won't stay in place. I'm returning for refund. Poor quality for a mirror of this price."
1,The Truth,"Have you ever wondered why a bully picks on some one smaller than himself? Maybe it's because he believes putting someone down will lift him up. Maybe it's his low self esteem, or his poignant past. Whatever the circumstances are, this book is appalling with nothing diminutive of lies, fantasy and outright pure jealousy. I believe that the author of this book is invidious of Bruce Lee and therefore just trying to dishonor his legacy. Save your money and save your time; this is not the truth - and nothing close to it."
1,Grossly inaccurate,"This book made me terrbily sick. As mentioned in a preveous review Mr. Bleeker sets a negative image of Bruce Lee. Many people that have read this book may think that this is the true story of his life, that he wasn't the hero that we should have. What many people don't know is that Mr. Bleeker had written this book to get back at Bruce for marrrieing Linda Lee Cadwell. If im not mistaken an attpemt to hinder the publishing of this book was made. This book also reminds me of one of those phycic hotlines that claims that they will bring you closer to your dead loved ones. People do alittle more research on Bruce Lee before you read this book. Bruce Lee for me will still and always reamin my hero."
1,Still A MYSTERY,"People are reviewing this book saying its about time the truth came out but I couldn't be sure what was fact or fiction. One review says ""god bless you MR Bleecker"" but why, I can find nothing here to prove his findings correct. I didn't buy this book I borrowed it from a freind who agreed there were no facts to be sure this is the truth. And Mr Bleecker small men don't use steroids"
1,Totally False,"Obviously the author had a hidden agenda here. If Bruce Lee took steroids, why wasn't he real big and bulky? Steroids don't make you lean and mean.For those of you out there want to learn what steroids actually do to the human body, do some research. It's obvious that looking at Bruce's physique that he wasn't on steroids. The only thing Bruce was addicted to was his love for the Martial Arts."
1,It confuses me. And why should we accecpt it as the TRUTH,"The book reads easely. But it is a bad book for believers in Bruce Lee. Why is he the only one who knows about those facts ? Why should I believe him, he has no prove."
5,"A Bruce Lee Fan, JKD and Kenpo Student","The book Unsettled Matters provides shocking insights on the life and death of Bruce Lee. Tom Bleecker knew Bruce Lee personally, researched his life, married Linda Lee and wrote Unsettled Matters."
3,Interesting read,"This book is a bit dated (published originally in the 60s and later updated). Unlike most juicing books, this one does not tell you to rid all meat from your diet (though it suggests cutting back). It provides interesting formulas for juice fasting and reorganizing your diet. The book suffers from a lack of update. Consequently, I was wondering if the philosophies purported in this book could be improved upon given what we now know about nutrition."
5,St. Anthony is outstanding!,"Scholarly, thoughtful blend of fact and fiction. Writing style is exceptional in bringing to life a real saint into reality. An excellent resource, well annotated."
1,Don't buy this!,"The description and picture of this media cabinet are very deceptive. The long sides and middle piece are delivered in two sections, which are then supposed to be stuck together with little plastic sticks. The entire cabinet is very flimsy, poorly designed, and made with only the cheapest materials. It's not worth $10 let alone what they are charging plus shipping. Keep looking."
5,Best for price,"It's a DBlock, so not to many features here. You could pay more but why? This works perfect and given the opportunity or the need I would not hesitate to buy a DB product again. one(1) 4awg input/output and four(4) 8awg inputs/outputs."
5,"A solid, recommended library reference","Deborah W. Cutler and Thomas J. Cutler's Dictionary Of Naval Abbreviations translates and defines many brief, common forms of naval communications which professional sailors may readily understand, but others may miss. Even staff briefings are filled with such abbreviations and special terminology, and any who regularly need to understand naval proceedings would do well to keep Dictionary Of Naval Abbreviations as a translator's reference. It and its companion Dictionary Of Naval Terms are written for Navy neophytes who have a need to understand the language of their new profession - and for outsiders such as journalists. A solid, recommended library reference."
3,The slave escapes.,This film is well done but mostly boring.The cover art is better.But that is not at all surprizing.
1,forget it,"Forget about, not even good enough for the trash can. Spend your money if you want, don't say I didn't tell you."
1,This book sounded better than it actually was...,"To be entirely truthful, the more I read of this book, the less I remembered why I was so interested in it in the first place. Trynin's writing style seems to be a like *most* of her lyrics--a bit nonsensical and completely all over the place. I also felt as if she whined an awful lot, whined about how the label wouldn't do things exactly as she wanted, then whined about how they didn't put in the effort required to make her an actual rock and roll star. I'll tell you this much--I barely got through the end of the book."
2,Short & Sweet Saga of a One Trick Pony,"I found this to be a light, fun, even informative read, but ultimately there's something missing...Make no mistake, I enjoyed it, but nonetheless, as I read, a certain undercurrent sort of burbled to the surface. Which was, I think, neatly summmarizable in this question: ""what DOES Jen really care about?"" It's obviously not really the music. To her, it's just a matter of getting the formula right...along with the right tight pants, big shoes and leather jacket...the right amp and guitar. Everything is in the service of Jen, whatever it takes for her to ""make it"", to no be a nobody. Very short shrift is given to her ""art"", what it means to her, etc...for those of us who care about such things, we're left with an empty feeling and, even more to the point, the observation, ""if she doesn't care deeply about her music, why should we?"""
4,Small things matter,"This book chronicles the lives of two human beings and several spiders and their tiny families in the humble cottage near Santa Rosa, California affectionately called ""Petunia Manor"" by its renters, Yvette and Terril. While they are completing their college studies on limited incomes and a lot of ingenuity, they look out for several other small creatures like an alligator lizard which insists upon making Petunia Manor its home. Interspersed in the chronicle are several essays about animals encountered on the campus of the college. The essay on the banana slug is worth the price of the book by itself.After finishing the book I came away with the idea that small things do matter, and we CAN make room in our homes for spiders."
2,Santana Redux,"The playing on this CD is actually pretty good. A couple songs are standouts, namely ""Forever"" and ""My Lady"".....The percussion section is top notch, fiery and very musical. The bass player is a monster and the keyboards add nice flavors throughout. The guitarist is good, especially if you like Santana; however, his mimicry of Santana is so relentless it takes away from the overall feel of the music. If you like Santana music, and feel the need for a little more, check this out. If you're not a Santana fan, STAY AWAY!"
5,Quoridor Review,"I ordered this game on the recommendation of a coworker and not only did I receive it in a timely manner, both the children and I love playing this game. I highly recommend it as a way to help stimulate critical thinking skills in children and adults.I love the wood design which means it will be around for a long time."
5,Great item and a great price!,Found this game originally in store for a higher price....it was great to find a deal during this holiday season and receive it so quickly!
3,"Quality game, but can become redundant","It seems the best of these newer type, original games. Best if played with four, as opposed to two, people."
4,Gigamic Quoridor Classic Game from Amazon is great,"Gigamic Quoridor Classic Game from Amazon is great. My 12 year old grandson beat me 50% of the time, my Masters Degree notwithstanding."
5,Another winner from Gigamic,"Terrific, original boardgame -- beautiful wooden construction, simple rules lead to a surprisingly complex game for 2 or 4 players, small pieces are easy to lose but company said they will replace at no charge if necessary. We love it!"
1,Limited players!,"Inspired by the other reviews of this game, I got it for my 6 and 8 year old. I was sorely disappointed, though. The major problem I have with it is that it really has to be played in multiples of 2--ie, 2 or 4 people. 3 people doesn't work very well at all, because then there's not really an opposite opponent for the 3rd player. I found this very limiting, since it's usually my 2 daughters and I who play games together.That said, it was easy enough that my 6 year old could play with my 8 year old while I did other stuff, but I was looking for a family game."
4,The VHS tapes are good -- the DVDs are SUPERB!!!,"Go here (to the DVD versions) to see my full reviews of these great episodes:Avengers '67 - Set 3, Vols. 5 & 6Forget the VHS tapes -- buy the DVDs! They are MUCH clearer and sharper."
3,"Underrated as an artist, underproduced album","Although this album came late in Joe Bataan's Career, it only touches on what his musical influences and styles are. His sounds are mostly old-school (think Billy Stewart) and real New York Salsa/Caribbean. Few know of his real roots, which are African American and Filipino, and grew up in Spanish Harlem. He was Latin by association, and has every right to call himself a Latin artist. Another of his pre-Afrofilipino and Rap-o-Clap-o albums which better exemplifies his work is ""Saint Latin's Day Massacre"", from 1974. Joe Bataan is now reportedly working as a juvenile counselor in NYC, and is happy to hear that his works are gaining life through a new audience."
2,music of the Renaissance,"While most books and documentaries on the Harlem Renaissance focus on the writers and the painters of the era, this work focuses on the musicians. Most of the musical coverage is of the grainy, black-and-white motion picture productions of the time. This is accurate but may not appeal to modern viewers. Some of the vibrancy that comes through in the materials art just isn't here. Further, the transition from performances to narrative and commentary and back does not flow well. Still, this would be a great work for students taking jazz courses or for fans of classic jazz. Unlike many of the Renaissance's writers and artists, the musicians covered here survived for decades. It's hard for me to even pigeonhole them as Renaissance figures."
2,"Good Look, but...","The first shipment came missing two bolts for assembling. Found that the Chinese manufacturer does not have an office in US and therefore not been able to get the parts. Took quite an effort to put the parts back to the box for returning to Amazon. Good return/pickup service was provided by Amazon. The replacement came. After assembly, it looks very good. But after using it for a while, we found that the lumbar support is at the wrong place, too pronounced and the whole cushion is too hard to conform to you body. So you don't get a more uniform support sitting in it. It is not quite comfortable sitting in it to watch a movie. More recently, I start to develop a discomfort in my back muscle. This has never occurred before I acquired this recliner. I wonder whether the strain in the muscle sitting on this chair has caused it."
3,"Flashy good as ever, but the plot a major letdown","One thing Fraser has never done in the Flashman Papers before is to play fast and loose with history, except to the smallest extent necessary to insert Flashy into the action. In this book he invents a pre-Civil War secret group of immense power and with no basis at all in fact. What a disappointment."
4,Informative and Entertaining!,"Now I'm sure you all know that I love the Flashman Series and consider George MacDonald Fraser to be our equivalent of Dumas so it'll come as no surprise to find that I really enjoyed this book. What surprised me is how ""serious"" it was. Oh yes, there's still those moments of totally insane and ribald humour as our poor hero falls from one frying pan into another - quite often as a result of his own inability to control his lustful character but, and here's the meat of the matter, this is a very serious book at times. I almost felt I was reading a real history, about the situation in the United States just before the Civil War and leading up to John Brown's attack on Harper's Ferry. Poor Flashman tries his hardest to prevent the act but... even when he's being good, the fates are against him.Once more this is a cracking read; informative and entertaining. But I'm fast running out of Flashmans... how will I ever be able to cope?"
3,Disappointing,"I enjoy this series and have had many enjoyable hours laughing at the 19th century's most outrageous cad. But this one is a bit thin and takes a lifetime to finally get to Harper's Ferry. When Harry and Co. finally make it there, even then it drags a bit. Not Flashman's best by any means."
4,Great book for kids,"This is a very good book for kids in the fourth and fifth grades. It deals with complex issues, requires children to envision a photograph inside a story, has a lot of symbolism, serious subject matter, and in the end, like any good novel, a sense of redemption. Great for teachers to read aloud or for children to read independently. MacLachlan can be a little heavy-handed with the themes at times, but hey, it's a kids book; they need the heavy-handedness to get used to interpreting themes."
4,A very good book to read.,"This is a good book to read even if you are in the third grade. It's a little hard to understand at first, but once you get into it,you'll really love the whole book."
2,Sloppy if not downright wrong,"I bought this for half price from a used bookstore (they had several copies) so I should've been warned. Within a few pages of starting this book, in a section of vector algebra, the author states that all vectors in an orthonormal basis are eigenvectors of all unitary operators. That's a ludicrous statement that is trivially wrong. Being a bit afraid that I might be led astray when reading sections on material I didn't already know, I checked the web for other mentions of this book. The only website I found (besides the publishers) was one hosting a lengthy errata for the book, full of corrections to sloppy mistakes in this book. Warning number two. Here it is (you'll need it):w3.pppl.gov/~hammett/talks/ 2001/core-theories-errata.pdfI think the idea behind this book is great, and I haven't found anything yet as aggregious as the mistatement about unitary transforms. But beware. This isn't a book by a physicist, and it shows."
3,"Six Core or ""hard"" Core?","While it's pleasant having an overview of physics in one place I am unhappy with the lack of care in writing the text. For example, the section on functional calculus frequently changes notation during an explanation. Also, much more emphasis should have been placed on the fact that the differentiation of functionals produces functional DENSITY derivatives. However, with some effort, I DID succeed in understanding this section. Needs greater clarity of presentation, perhaps with more diagrams."
3,Pc transfer,Product did work. Several attempts were needed because you were not aware of transfer completion. Better directions are needed to complete transfer. Not all programs worked on new computer. Some had to be reinstalled manually. Installation took approx. 2 hours.
5,Great Book!,"This book is wonderful, Chris Ingham did a great job gathering all the facts. The opening section is my favourite, it has all the facts you want to know from The Beatles -- Though I would liked to see more about the breakup and why they stopped touring. Another great section is The Canon - Ingham covered amazingly well the 50 essential songs (not the best, the essential).Buy the book if you like The Beatles ... You won't regret it!"
3,Nickel Dreams: My Life,"I recently bought this book off of a sale table at a book store, and I was pleasantly surprised at what a good book this was. Tanya Tucker has definitely had a very interesting life and career, so far, although it seemed to me while reading this book that she is always skating very closely to edge, no matter what she undertakes, and it seems as if she enjoys pushing the envelope as far as she can, without thinking of the consequences until AFTER the fact. I would be very interested in reading an addendum to this book in another 5-7 years, to see how her life has progressed and also to see how the lives of her children (I've read that she now has a third child) have progressed, as well."
5,Nancy and Frank,"Personally, I think that Nancy and Frank should somehow work out their relationship. Frank should dump Callie and Nancy should dump Ned. This book was by far the best one of the series. Frank and Nancy FINALLY kiss. I have also heard that in the book The Last Resort, there is some more stuff dealing with their relationship. So far , I havent read that book but if you have and konw what takes place, please email me. lady_eagles_golf@yahoo.com"
5,Great book,"This was a really good book, probaly the best of the Super Mysterys. The super mysterys are a harder read than the regular Nancy Drew books, and they're longer. ^_^"
1,Missing Pieces!,This puzzle would have been great if it had all of its pieces! Boo MB puzzle.....this is the second time in a row!
5,Garfield as Himself,"I believe I was too young to remember Here Comes Garfield and Garfield on the Town when they originally aired. As for Garfield Gets a Life, I don't remember it every being aired on CBS. Anyway, I have enjoyed watching these three specials on DVD. I laughed out loud when Garfield realized that he didn't have any front claws in Garfield On the Town."
4,"Garfield, Then and Now","The cover of this DVD shows the 1998 Garfield gazing in the mirror at his early 1978 self, the subject of these three specials. In 1980, Mt. St. Helen's blew it's top, and Garfield's first book, Garfield at Large, topped the New York Times bestsellers list. Two years later, Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez, the team that brought Peanuts to the screen, unleashed Jim Davis' fat cat in his first prime time special, Here Comes Garfield. His first special was an Emmy award nominee, but the next year he took the Emmy with 1983's Garfield on the Town, and returned in a disco-era update, Garfield Gets a Life. Each of these specials was originally released on video, and all three are now together on this bargain-priced DVD for a flashback trip with Garfield down memory lane."
1,Piece of junk,"Don't waste your money on this product. It looks good in the ONLY picture the seller has provided, but when you get it, look at it and hold it up, it looks to be made from the cheapest materials possible. The lens is probably going to pop out any day now. The head strap doesn't stretch to a far enough length. There's horrible vision issues. I think i am going to buy a pair in an actual shop from now. Amazon can't be trusted when it comes to clothing and things like this."
1,vision issues,Not full vision and I wish my son at age 11 would have returned it but he is far from home and cannot.I will not purchase this again.
1,no thank you,First day out the lens popped off and is in the mountains somewhere. Dont bother with junior glasses. just get the small adult goggles.
2,So/So,"I bought a pair cheaper (kids Giro) than these and the quality of the other ones were much better. These were purchased for a 5-6 year old girl and it seemed they did not want to stay centered above her nose. We tried adjusting them, but they kept sliding to one side to the other, up or down on her face. In my opinion...bad design over the nose. On a positive...she does love that color pink."
3,short strap,these goggles had trouble fitting around my 3yr old son's helmet. At the most expanded position they still squeezed up against his face a little bit. We had to fiddle with them to find a comfortable position for him.
3,"It's cool, but not what I expected.","This is great, but I thought it was a video about how to make a haunted house. It's clips from scary movie's though. I misread the info :("
1,virtual haunted house,"I ordered the DVD assuming that the ""virtual haunted house"" would provide background ambiance to highlight my Halloween decorations. I assumed the ""virtual haunted house"" would be just that...a trip through a haunted house. It was nothing more than snippets of bad movies, mostly in black and white. ...and if I wasn't disappointed enough, the DVD wouldn't even continue to play towards the end. I ended up making a coaster out of it. Very disappointed!"
1,Halloween haunted house,"This was the worst!!!! I was looking for ideas on how to decorate my house, needless to say I got nothing I couldnt even get through it :("
2,Honestly...,"The best version of this song is the one on the ""Changes"" cd album. The mixes here are not enjoyable, nor do they add anything to the song. Unfortunately, they only terribly try to ""mix"" the song in no good way. This comes from a big fan of Christopher Williams and the New Jack era of music I still enjoy."
2,Yonder Stands an Unfinished Book,"I've enjoyed Barry Hannah's short stories in the past, but this novel put me to sleep 8 nights in a row. There are way too many characters to keep up, the story is confusing, and the characterizations weak. Aside from an amusing quip about former president Clinton (on page 212), this book failed to elicit even a snicker. One of the few books I've started, but not finished. Even an abundance of dogs and an absence of cats couldn't redeem this stinker. Sorry. HHD."
2,Incomprehensible,"I haven't read a book like this since I had to read Gravity's Rainbow in college; I didn't understand that one either. The more enlightened might argue that one needs to suspend convention when reading a book like this. I would respond by asking such a person to explain the story; their blank stare will betray them. Say that Hannah is writing ""beat"" or he's ""bold and original"", per the critical comments on the back cover. Just don't say he writes with any clarity."
1,"""yawn""-der stands...","this is my first exposure to barry hannah - and if his other work is anything like this novel, i can do without him. i read this for a class where most people were praising his prose but i found it inconsistent - flowery/harlequin through some passages and gritty/masculine through others. this didn't hold for me. hannah's writing comes across as fake and forced. i'm a big fan of po-mo lit and hannah doesn't hold a candle to delillo."
1,The first I've put a book down and stopped caring in a long time.,"This novel is for self-absorbed pseudo-intellectuals who like to read out in public with the cover facing out. Hannah trades emotion, strong characterization and plot development for flowery, inconsistent writing and not-so-witty asides. Only buy it if you're giving it to someone you don't like."
3,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"I agree that some of the writing/sentences are brillant, I didn't find the story cohesive. I read all the reviews and couldn't wait to sink my teeth into this book and half way through I felt I must be really dim not to be enjoying this book. By the end I decided perhaps many of the reviewers were afraid to admit this book was simply bizarre. The story was in solid 2nd place to the 'style'. I never forgot I was reading a work of fiction, few things rang true to me. I have a wide varity of likes in reading, but I would never be able to include this book."
2,"Over-rated, over-hyped","So this is his best book? Yeah, sure, he writes great sentences, but the narrative weaves, stumbles, and circles so that you are left with pages of mindless, incoherent, blather. Why couldn't he write paragraphs, pages, and chapters like he does the occasional sentence. Like a sports team loaded with showboating stars who don't play as a team and therefore can't win."
1,It's too big,"Be sure to make sure that you know exactly how large this actual watch is when you buy it. It's size is listed in millimeters, which is my fault for not paying enough attention to, but it should be clear before you buy it that this watch his huge. It was actually wider than my wrist, and I am a medium-to-large build man. It was like having a grandfather clock on my arm."
4,The Seasons of America Past,A very graphic and informative depiction of an era that is no longer with us. The people who lived this are no longer able to tell us about it.
2,Not Whitnell's best,"Set in lush, fairy tale land of Arthurian legend, Whitnell's book, The Cornish Legacy, seems to have forgotten the rule of authors - having her readers care about her characters.I don't mind a predictable plot if the author makes me feel the main character's feelings. I kept hoping for the Whitnell of A Charmed Circle, and A Clear Blue Sky. Not until the last 1/8 of the book did she finally appear, but by then I didn't care.This book was a disappointment. Skip this and read her older works if you want Whitnell at her best."
3,"""The Cornish Legacy"" Barbara Whitnell",Pleased to find another of Rosamunde Pilcher's book shelf authors that fulfill my expectations of a colorful saga from Endgland. I enjoyed the story from beginnig to the end. It was so easy to picture the country side and smell the sea while reading.
2,can't get into it,"i won't hate on this record. i just don't get it. bejar's work with the new pornographers led me here, but try as i may, i can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. it's as if i've heard all these songs before. maybe for you, definitely not for me!"
1,college rock,This precious little gem of college rock is barely quirky enough to make you feel smarter than your co-workers while sitting in your cubicle waiting for the end of your life.
3,could have been better,"I'm a big x raided fan but this cd wasn't very good for him. First off I dont like the beats, his lyrics are good but his voice sounds distorted because he's in the pen and I dont like how they did the voice over with him. Maybe he just wanted to try somthing different but I dont think it worked out for him. I liked his style on unforgiven. Favorite tracks are post war syndrum and who they wanna kill.db"
4,another G raided album,raided came through once again. i dont think this cd has many songs that arent tight. buy it if you like raided.
3,GOING DOWNHILL,"X-RAIDED is just going downhill since his last album NEFARIOUS/SPEAK OF DA DEVIL. He is just running out of stuff to rap about,it seems like. Vengeance Is Mine is nothing like PHYSCO ACTIVE,XORCIST,or THE UNFORGIVEN VOL.1 which were his best albums put out. Well I'm not going to hate on him or anything but I think it is worth the money i guess.It is also better than SPEAK OF DA DEVIL."
4,Nice idea. Imperfect execution.,"Now these are Expanded Universe figures I can get behind. I love the idea of using the Marvel Comics colors as a way of showing an alternate view of the Star Wars universe. It leaves hope for an eventual release of some of the Marvel-only characters, like Jaxx.Unforunately, with this one, they chose to use the ""Tarkin"" figure from Episode III, rather than one based on Peter Cushing. While it does help re-inforce the ""otherworldiness"" of the figures (by not looking much like Cushing), I would have preferred it if a more accurate mold had been used. Still, a lot of fun and adds a new Stormtrooper to the ranks. Well worth it."
4,Great to collect,If you are a sports fan they are great to collect.Very accurate and made well.Also like his tv shows.haha.
4,leadsinger review,WE have enjoyed using this with our Karoke mic. Some of the songs were duplicated on this which were on the original. Might have chosen different songs for each one. It is easy to use.
5,love it,"this skillet is great. very easy to clean and light to handle. i cook a lot of oreintal food, which using high heat has ruined my other nonstick skillets, nothing has stuck to this thing. im impressed i see why rachael ray uses this on her show. i cook a lot and love to cook, this skillet and the others in this line that i've bought make it more of a pleasure than it already was and are worth every penny i spent."
1,"rachael ray 12"" open skillet","Never again will I order anything from Rachael Ray. This was supposed to be a christmas present and my daughter never received it. It's bad enough that she lives italy and we live in the states ,so when you order something you want her to get it at a reasonably time. I had to order her something else from a different company. It was delivered as estimated but it wasn't there for xmas. But at least she received the order from the second company. If there was zero stars that is what it would of been rated."
5,Love it,There's nothing I don't like. I just need to remember to not put in dishwasher so I don't ruin the finish
4,Great Pan,"Pan is very light and cleans up with a wipe of a cloth. Only issue is I wish base had a bigger diameter, but works well for most food items."
4,Love this pan,"This is a great product that lives up to it's product description. The surface is great, nothing sticks. The handle is soft and easy to grip. It cleans up in a snap. I've had the more expensive version of this pan, and would take this one any day. My only complaint is that I wish it had a lid."
5,My Favorite Pan,"This pan has become my favorite pan, it is the perfect weight for me, so easy to clean, the shape makes it so easy to move your food in the pan, and it has a comfortable handle. I have also ordered the smaller version and soon to get the other one. If you order this pan you will not be disappionted. Great pan at a great price.I just love this pan, it has made cooking fun again."
3,"OK, but ...","We had one of these and really liked it, but then the Teflon started coming off - big time. There were three people in the house using this, so I can't vouch for how the pan was treated, but we do tend to use plastic with Teflon.In September, I bought another just like it, and I was determined to make sure that only plastic utensils were used with it. After just three months, the Teflon is coming off. I know that the problem is with the pan and not with the users because I was the principal user and the only washer, and I know the others used plastic tools when cooking.This is a nice-looking large pan that cooks very well, but I don't like eating Teflon.Speaking of ""large,"" measurements can be deceptive. The 12"" on this product refers to the cooking surface, while most other pans measure from the outside rim. This makes it difficult to know what you are getting unless you buy in a store - something I seldom do. Give me Amazon Prime every time."
5,My husband says it makes him feel like a chef!,"We needed some new pans and I was looking online at the usual Calphalon and more expensive brands when I came across Rachel Ray's collection. We definitely wanted hard anodized, nonstick and these pans looked sturdy and fit the bill so I figured I give them a try. I was impressed by the quality and heaviness of the pan. You can tell it's quality. The nonstick surface is flawless and the hard anodization distributes the heat evenly. My husband uses this pan almost every night and he says it makes cooking so easy he feels like a professional. If you haven't tried Rachel Ray's products give them a chance. I would by more of her cookware in a heartbeat."
3,Too Pricey,I really enjoy these dvd's but I think it cost way too much $24.95 for 50 min of time. They need to lower the cost of their dvd's or I won't buy anymore. The cold case files are good but on this dvd their is only 2 cases and for the price their should be a lot more. I would have given more stars but for the price they get only 3.
4,A sad look from the guys on the other side of the lens.,"I thought the book was enlightening, showing a tiny glimpse into another facet of Diana's personality. The stories told by Glenn and Mark sometimes were funny but most of the time sad, showing how strange life with the British royals must have been for Diana and how confining her life continued to be when she tried to break away and make a life on her own. I just kept asking ""what if"", if she wouldn't have spent so much time running away, would the paparazzi eventually have moved on to another target and left her alone?"
3,"Pets Healthy Pet Diner, Off-White, 12-Inch","I specifically ordered the off-white version to match the off-white pet diner that I already have for my other dog. However the one shipped to me is black. My local pet stores have the black ones in stock for a little cheaper price. If I had known that I wouldn't receive the off-white one that I ordered, I would have saved a few bucks & helped our local store."
4,Perfect for my Boxer/Lab,"We have always had taller food bowls for our dog this one was just the next step on his growth outlook , it is outside as we feed him out side due to the fact he likes to make a mess with his natural diet. It is so easy to clean and take care we had metal dishes in a metal holder before and they rusted this works well for our family have not tried the water bottle holder as we think our dog might chew up the bottle but having the hole there is nice. Like I said our Boxer/Lab is a big dog and this fits perfect so he does not have to bend over to eat."
4,Bigger Bowls would make it better,The product is great except for the fact that the bowls could be larger. Having a large dog......she goes through the water very quickly.
5,Perfect,"We needed something for our 2 dogs, one medium size and one a bit larger and this has worked perfectly for both of them. We loved it so much we bought another for our camper"
2,Misrepresented Product,"I ordered these, and while they were a good price and a pretty good product overall, one was blue and the other was cotton candy pink. Not exactly what I want in my kitchen and not exactly in the product description that they will deliver any color they want to. It leads you to believe they are just white. Make sure to check on that, I will be returning mine."
2,Unsanitary,"I'm surprised nobody has said anything about this major design flaw...We bought the 12"" feeder for our German Shepherd and at first I really liked it, but whenever your dog slurps the water everywhere or even if you spill a little while filling it up the water seeps down underneath the bowl and after a couple of days if you lift up the bowl the dark crevace underneath is growing eyeballs and reeking like you wouldn't believe! I've had to wash it every other day since we got it, but we're going to have to recycle the plastic holder and find an iron one that will hopefully fit the bowls.Don't waste your money. If you want an elevated bowl get one that won't trap food and water underneath and grow bacteria. Yuck!"
4,Just what I was looking for..,"I get the feeling it might slide on my stone kitchen floor, so it's in a corner. Other than that, the color is good, height is perfect and the water add on is pretty sweet."
2,Great concept.. awful to keep clean!,"We bought this product the day we adopted our short hair Border Collie from the pound. I really love the height and sturdiness of the product. The one thing that drives me absolutely nuts is how hard it is to keep the black looking even remotely clean. Even with soft water and a daily scrubbing from its first wash it has never gone back to looking right. I cannot tell you how much this drives me nuts as I pride myself on keeping my kitchen very clean as well as our animals feeding bowls. The bowls themselves clean up like a dream, the actual container not at all. I have tried traditional soap and water, Magic Eraser, etc,etc,etc. Anyone have any ideas or tips to help me out?"
2,Not what the picture presented,"While this looks like a sturdy product and would be good for someone, it is NOT what I thought I was ordering. The picture was misleading. Then when I called customer service, they said I would have to pay to send it back. And they won't refund shipping costs. So I would actually end up spending more to send it back!"
2,"Better for a tiny, short-eared dog","My 20 lb mutt could not get her snout in there to eat in a comfortable manner. Further, her long ears dragged in the water bowl beside the food bowl, making a mess. I can't use it."
1,I have never received this - can you please tell me where it is?,"I ordered this item with the Duck Dynasty book but only receiced the book. PLease advise as to where my purchase is, and I will be looking into my Visa charges because if I was charged for it and never received, I would expect a credit. Thank you - Steph Olsen"
3,good for small dog,"pros: fairly good design, easy to cleancons; light weight, gets knocked around, water gets under bowlgood, but for small under 20# dogs"
1,No customer service,"As if one would need customer service for a dog bowl...The issue is that the thing was shipped without the metal bowls which are supposed to sit in the plastic frame. Amazon apparently has no customer service advice that I can find on their site other than 'if you have problems, contact the manufacturer.' Which I did try doing but have not received a reply after four days. If anyone knows how to contact Amazon's customer service about issues such as these, please let me know. I am a frequent Amazon customer and this is the first time that I have had to try to resolve an issue with something I bought from the site. I have always had confidence in Amazon but now am seeing a flaw in their business model that I do not like."
5,worth it,"This product is well worth the money I spent. Good price and great quality unlike the ones you see at walmart for just as much or more. I love that it came with metal bowls. The only thing I didnt like was the loose packaging not a big deal but when I get something ""new"" it should be without any blemishes. perfect size for my 2 y/o pit bull."
4,raised pet diner,"Not fancywork but excellent. Two good size bowls for my very old cocker spaniel, outer margins of holders around bowls catch spills and drips. Easy to slide over to her when. being blind, she can't find it easily."
2,Not good for laptops,"I wouldn't recommend this for most laptops. I have an alienware laptop, and the lid is a cross between matte and glossy black ( a muted kind of black ). I tested the #2 on a small area on the lid. It would probably remove the fine scratches, but I didn't use enough to find out. However, it leaves your plastic looking permanently extrememly shiny black. It looks like a grease spot, to be honest, rather than something desirable. You have to know what this is good for- don't use it on things that you don't want to have a greasy-like shine. It would work best on clear plastics.The novus #1 is a waste of money. I'm pretty sure it's just windex. It smells like it and does the same job. Also, the ""cloth"" it comes with is just a thick paper towel.I recommend Plexus plastic cleaner/polish for laptop use. It mutes the look of scratches (its not an abrasive) and makes it look like new, protecting against fingerprints, ect."
2,Does not fit for my 2005 Subaru Tribeca. : (,Does not fit for my 2005 Subaru Tribeca. : (Creaked on the first day. Genuine spare part has a lug in the attachment point. This spare part is flat base and stabilizer loose.
2,"Pearl was okay, chain was not","I ordered these necklaces as a gift for my bridesmaids. When they arrived, the pearl looked nice, but I immediately noticed that for all three necklaces I ordered, the chains were discolored in several locations. It was pretty obvious to the point that I didn't feel I could give them as a gift as they were. I even tried using a jewerly cleaner to remove the brownish discolorations, but it didn't help. I'm wondering if it's really a sterling silver chain as advertised..."
1,doesn't hold up,Gave this necklace as a gift for Christmas. My friend was wearing the necklace recently and realized the pearl had fallen off the mount.
1,Pearson's Salted nut roll,Received the product which took forever and then when the product it was old candy. I had to call the company and they resent the product which also took forever.
5,"Models(several of them well-known),NO make-up,pure!","I'm sick too death of glossy,airbrushed,pretentious fashion photography books.Unnatural lighting&poses,loads of thick,spackled-on make-up.This is the antithesis of all that-models(a number of them well-known),without ANY make-up or unnatural lighting,in their own clothes,in natural poses of their own choosing,giving the camera a glimpse of their true selves,without any artifice of any kind.MAGNIFICENT book,probably the coolest fashion photography book I've ever seen.Can't WAIT for J.T.'s Photographs.He contributes an awesome spread to Joe's,you should buy that one too if you haven't already.This is an AWESOME book."
4,LOVE this hand cream,"Although it is a little greasy, it definitely works. I get terribly dry hands in the winter, and this definitely works to keep my hands soft. I wish it was easier to find!"
5,Fantastic Swashbuckling Fun Read,"Arielle Benoit, Comtesse D'Ambois and her cousin Dolpho fled their home in St. Cyr to ferret out the spies of Napolean who are a part of the English aristocracy. When Dolpho is killed...by the Fox of Grandquest, Ari must expose this murdering spy and is shot when she attempts to board his ship and shoot him...The Earl of Grandquest is searching for the same spy and thinks he's found his spy in Arielle...a less than perfect speciman of womanhood that both intriques and irritates Fox...and makes him feel responsible for her when her attempt on his life leaves her injured...and with a case of amnesia!Can both overcome all obsticles in their paths and find the real spy? Ms. Darkwood has created a fast and fun swashbuckler here reminiscent of the old Errol Flynn movies I so loved way back when! I can't recommend this book highly enough as Ms. Darkwood has outdone herself...again!"
2,Could get most of this information for free,"I did not find this book any more helpful than the Charleston Area 2003 Official Visitors Guide that I ordered for free on the internet (I'd give you the url, but it's not allowed, so do a search). It did offer information on hotels, which the free guide did not. However, the free book gave more information on local events, tours, and sightseeing. This book is not worth the money, get the free one!"
3,Helpful hints!,"It was very helpful in giving me a good insight about the museums, arts and dining scene of Charleston."
4,good book,"Has a lot of nice tables and diagrams. Comprehensive chapters on PM&R problems (i.e. spasticity, pressure ulcers) and tools (i.e. orthotics, pharmacology), but doesn't have chapters that breakdown/summarize management of patients with stroke, TBI, SCI, etc. Reading it feels more like reading something in paragraph form (details, explanations), as opposed to quick outline form (for instance like those BRS books). In my opinion, too large to carry in your white coat pocket, but good to keep as a reference."
2,Not serious enough!,"The beginning of the video shows women telling their husbands that they're pregnant and the husband then boasts ""I did it"". Too corny if you ask me. I made sure I fast forwarded through this before my husband saw this or he would not have watched it at all!! The rest of the video was so-so with some more corny stuff. It was informative but I would try and find a more serious video before purchasing this one."
5,an excellent recount,"International Journal of Dermatology, August 1998 ""...The genocide, the pathos, and the grim details of war are recounted with objectivity and compassion. The author is an excellent war correspondent and medical journalist."""
2,Croatian Propaganda,"Dr. Blaskovich is an ethnic Croatian who merely parrots the party line from Zagreb that all Serbs are evil and all Croats and good. He ignores Serb victims of Croatian war crimes and exclusively documents crimes against Croatians. That is an inexcusable bias. Little surprise then that the book sheds no light on the destruction of the Serbian minority in Krajina and the Croatian army's pillage of Serb churchs and entire communities. The root causes of the war are also simplistically examined. The reality, as we now know, is that the 13% Serb minority of Croatia had genuine fears of of a resurrected neo-Nazi regime - much like the one which carried out a Holocaust against the Serbs in World War II - and wanted no part of an independent Croatia. The Serbs fought for their own right to secede from Croatia and were in turn exterminated.Blaskovich, being pro-Croat, naturally ignores this fact.A good book for any student of military-historical propaganda."
1,An instrument of croatian and muslim propaganda,"The author cleraly turns the facts upside down, picturing croats and moslems as the victims. Mr. Blaskovich tries to pass himself as an American, yet his name alone tells us that the man is croatian and thus deliberately spreads false information about so called atrocities by the Serbs, most of which were in fact conducted by the Croats and Moslems (I have seen it happen). I also happen to know that Mr. Blaskovich enjoys the support of one of the most extreme moslem fundamentalist fanatics, namely Mr. Muhammed Sacirbey, who is wanted in many places for co-engineering the genocide of the Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia. The Croat-Muslim axis in this book is clearly evident. Read it, have a great laugh, but don't ever believe a single word of it."
1,Paranoid ramblings,"In the canon of conspiracy theories and hate mongering, Blaskovich's work stands as a classic. His contribution to historical dialog and insight is what Jeffrey Dahmer was to quality childcare.Anatomy of Deceit is little more than a half-baked rationalisation for Croatian sponsored ethnic cleaning and a twisted apology for Franjo Tudjman's quasi-fascism. Substitute Tudjman's name with Pavlic's and we would be dismissing this work as Ustache state propaganda.Add Blaskovich to the long list of reality-challenged doctors, poets and professors who have blighted the Balkans; maybe more effort should be given to analysing the combined effects their delusions have had on the region."
1,apauling piece of propaganda,"This is not the first time that one's biases are being sold to the general readership in the form of a book, but readers need to be aware of the author's background. A Croat himself, Blaskovich has portrayed only one side, at the expense of history and factual background. As someone who served with the Red Cross in Bosnia and aided the refugees, I happen to know that Mr. Blaskovich's account is not only biased but also ignorant of other people's suffering. And that exactly is the problem with the Balkans: only when people there are willing and able to recognize their enemy's suffering and destitude can there be peace in that troubled region. Mr. Blaskovich only ignites further hatred and animosities by spreading one-sided propaganda, which is in clear violation of his professional ethics - both as a doctor and a want-to-be writer."
1,Silly,"Silly, silly, silly. I can forgive Blaskovich his middle-aged ""gee, I'm a writer"" brush with celebrity and the fact that he's in all the photos. I can forgive the his fumbling facts and dates on every page, I can even forgive his over-the-top apologetics for the authoritarian Croatian regime. After all, its expatriates in the ""diaspora"", exactly like Blaskovich, who support dictatorial President Tudjman in power. No, the really really annoying thing about this book is the fact that the editor spoke no english. There are literally grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors on every single page. How can you take Blaskovich seriously when he doesn't even bother to proofread his own book. Silly, silly, silly."
1,Nonsense,"Don't bother. The book is terrible. The writer can't write. The editor didn't edit. Dates are wrong, facts are wrong. Spellings are wrong. There are so many books out there about the Balkans... do yourself a favor, read any other one."
1,Croatian-American writes book on his 'homeland',"Dr Blaskovich is a ethnic Croatian who returned to his war ravaged 'homeland' to investigate war crimes and wrote a book about it. Unsurprisingly the book takes a very pro-Croat view of the conflict, casting it a struggle between good (the Croats) and evil (the Serbs). Instead of shedding light on the topic, as he purports to do, he only strengthens prejudices. Although his intentions may have been good and the book is sometimes interesting reading it is not a balanced or very knowledgeable account of the conflict in former Yugoslvaia."
5,Nutritional,"I asked my Vet if this type of cat treat would be good for my cat, Mischa. He said it was one of the more nutritional treats to give to cats.Mischa loves his little fishie's. That is what they look like. So I would recommend this product for any cat owner.Sharon"
4,the BEST !!!!,"I am owned by muliple cats and they all LOVE this product. I have recommended it to other cat ""owners"" and they have had the same results."
3,Finicky cat,"I can't really review this item because the cat for which I bought this product will not eat it. I have another cat that does eat it, but he doesn't have a need for it."
5,exactly as described - easy to program and works great.,bought these as replacements for my 2004 ford focus wagon - they were easy to program and easy to use. very quick shipping too!
4,Enfamil Prosobee Liquid Formula,"Good product even though I hate feeding my baby formula. Easy to mix, however, you have to use it up fast, but they come in small enough containers it worked out well."
3,This is not powder,I bought this thinking it was powder formula. It is concentrated liquid. Now that I look at it more closely I can see I was wrong but it isn't specifically stated anywhere. I thought I was getting a heck of a deal :) but it turns out I'm paying more than what powder costs.My baby requires soy formula due to digestive issues. We tried Similac and Enfamil. Enfamil does not smell as strong as the Similac and my baby seemed to do better on it. Both of my kids needed to be formula fed/supplemented. My older child did better on Similac. Sometimes it takes trail and error to find what your baby does best on. Your doctor usually has free samples to try until you find the right one. Delivery was prompt and I had no other issues with my order.
2,Where did this formula come from?,"We received the multipack of formula reasonably punctually. No complaints about its quality, but on the last container (might conceivably have been on others and wasn't noticed) is the following label:For sale at CVS/Pharmacy only (lists a store number) - If found at other outlets phone this number (lists number)caveat emptor!"
3,Bad taste in general,"In general, I found my son did not like the taste of Prosobee formula and we switched back to similac sensitive. I did not like this product because it comes in cans, versus the plastic-like simlac bottles"
3,A little outdated,"The book has a lot of good information, but being published so many years ago, alot of the medical information is very outdated"
5,"Just listen to it, and you'll see!","A gave this album 5 stars, just because is one of the best salsa albums ever.I have a bootleg split cd bought in Medellin , Colombia from this guys and la orquesta narvaes and is one of my favorites cd's.If you like old school salsa brava you have to own this one, you will never regret!"
5,insightful book for those interested in the biblical prophets,"ms. mckenna has written a very readable book for a broad audience. i think it is a good book to start with if you are unfamiliar with the hebrew prophets, getting to the heart of their message and passion. i also think its a good book for those more familiar with the prophets. the final chapter, which i enjoyed and found refreshing in ways, may be a bit edgy for those who take a stricter application of the word ""prophet"" in the hebraic sense. i will admit that while i did find the last chapter relevant to our current situation, i do think it steps outside the mold of classical biblical prophecy. but it demonstrates ms. mckenna's view of a God who passionately cares about the whole of creation, and that the Divine is constantly speaking to us, often is ways we don't expect."
4,"Many questions, no answers","Never saw the first doc on this case, but this sequel seems sufficient to explain what happened and why. A group of media savvy LA scenesters have taken up the case of the three convicted teens, and this movie tells their story as they try to link the step-father of one of the victims to the 1993 crime. Informed viewers still don't get enough meat here to make a judgment either way, but the film, despite pretensions to neutrality, certainly makes its viewpoint clear: the crazy guy did it, not the teens. But Damien, the oldest teen, is his own worst enemy in raising suspicions. You wonder how did the evil stepdad manage to hold down three squirming 8-year-olds long enough to murder them as they played in the woods? Maybe it took three teens to do it? You just don't get to hear enough solid evidence to decide what is innuendo and what is fact here. You do see some gruesome crime scene pix."
4,Eye-opening,"The only problem with this DVD is that there isn't enough info about the original investigation. This is truly a fascinating watch, and a very sad commentary on the state of mind of middle America even nowadays. That these children were screwed over so obviously by our ""justice"" system is sad and really burns in the heart of anyone who believes in justice. The most fascinating character is still the crazy Step-father who is totally ""sketchy"" really appears to be much more capable of murder than the docile children who were convicted. I haven't seen the first film and would love to know more about just HOW these kids were railroaded. Did they have alibi's, what was the argued motive etc., etc. These details would have been a nice addition to this film just so that everyone was more familiar with the background, however, this is still a very interesting flick. Very sad."
1,Totally Sick,"I cannot believe this. It is such a mockery of justice. F'n robbed of their freedom just because the law couldn't pin it on anyone else. These teens may have liked heavy music and dressed in black , but that does not make them murderers. The loss of evidence(which was not there to f'n begin with) is ridiculous. In my opinion, the Byers guy is guilty as hell(toothless liar). Just because they were different the cops blamed them for the murders of those children to make it look more obvious to the victims' families and to the public. Even talking about this B.S. angers me. Good film. Paradise Lost II will sure make you mad as hell to watch it though. FREE THE WM3!!!"
3,WM3 continued...,"While the first documentary was pretty unbiased, this one was definitely in favor of the WM3 convicted of the murders. It was unfortunate not to have a more balanced view, as the murdered boys' families chose not to participate (can't blame them for that), save for the creepy stepfather of Christopher Byers. It still made me believe that there was not enough evidence to convict the WM3, but left many unanswered questions. Unfortunately, truth can be like that. Hopefully it caused people to sit up, investigate the case, and DNA evidence testing will provide a permanent sequel that will answer questions once and for all."
4,Interesting but ....,"Like it's predecessor, this is a fascinating and probing look at a case that continues to rouse many questions and controversies. Made a few years after the original ""Paradise Lost"", it is interesting to see where the people, especially the accused Memphis Three, had come to, and how they now viewed all that had happened. But a great deal of this documentary is just footage from the first - which is important in giving context - but it means that there is not all that much new content here. But what is there is very good, and very interesting. I just in some ways think it would have been better to have found a way of adding the new material onto the original documentary, turning into a single ""extended version"". If you watch the two together, chances are you will find this second one just a tad tedious because you will have already seen so much of it before."
4,Creepier than fiction,"Remember the freaky mother of one of the victim's, the one that put her dead son's Boy Scout handkerchief over her head and did a little dance for the cameras in the first movie? The same kind of weird displays are seen in this sequel, as the film chronicles events after the first trial. Most disturbing of all is Mark Byers, the father of one of the boys killed. His improv rantings and melodramatic displays portray a freak in a freaky small town. This guy is more disturbing than Hannibal Lechter, and more so when you remind yourself the guy is for REAL!A little weaker than the first film, yet still a fascinating documentary of a small town thrown into chaos by a big-town crime."
3,Lots of history and recipes (which need more detail for me),"I've found it to be a very interesting book to read for the history as well as the recipes. I would, however, like greater detail in those recipes because while they are probably good enough for a good cook an amateur like me would need a bit more detail. You may also find that you'll need an English/American dictionary (Amazon has one or more)because this book was written by an Englishman and some terms will likely not be familiar."
2,"shapes fall out easy, must be a better clock out there!","Although the construction of this toy is sturdy, the shapes always fell out when being stored and really bothered us. Plus the logic of how the each shape was shaped bothered my 3 year old (she thought the 5 sided one should have 5 sides) we ended up giving the toy away."
2,My 2-Year-Old Son Doesn't Play With It,"Toys like this upset me with myself. It's cheap so it's not a big deal if your child doesn't like it, but all these cheap toys that my son doesn't like add up to a lot of money spent that could've been used for better toys or educational programs."
1,I bought this and then sold it at a yard sale,"Paint chips off (all too common with Melissa and Doug items)which is hazardous to the little ones, especially those who ""taste"" everything. Too many pieces."
2,A hexagon has 6 sides.,I'm not buying this product because the pentagon has a 6 on it and the hexagon has a 5 on it.
1,A Disappointment,"Although Melissa and Doug products are known for their excellence, this product was a disappointment. I intended it for my grandson, who is learning the basic shapes and is also very interested in clocks. However, most of the shapes in this product are not the basic shapes that children learn(square, rectangle, etc.), and the clock is small and uninteresting. I returned this product to Amazon."
4,Good way to explore telling time,"I like this clock -- it's good for exploring how to tell time. It's different from a Judy clock in that you have to move the hands yourself, that is, they move independently of each other. The Judy clock has gears that move both hands together if you move the long hand. There are benefits to both, so you should consider which you like best before making a purchase. I do like the variety of shapes to learn. It's nice to go beyond circle, square, triangle, and rectangle."
5,Excellent product,"I think some people are just expecting too much. I bought this for my three-yr-old and am very pleased. My daughter has a TV program that comes on at one o'clock and I wanted to teach her how to recognize that particular hour. The shapes were a bonus for us. And I can teach her at a later time to count minutes. She's having fun recognizing numbers and matching them with the shapes. She also likes stacking them and making towers and watching it fall (an added bonus)! She's too young to know the five has six sides and the six has five sides. And if she did figure that out, then I'd praise her for noticing, not be negative about the product. It is, after all, a toy. Toys aren't perfect, and after a while they fall apart. But if they've accomplished the purpose for which you bought it, then it was money well spent, in my opinion."
5,Great educational and durable toy!,"My 4 year old was interested in learning to tell time from our kitchen clock, but my husband and I were not succeeding in getting through to her. This clock is perfect! She is learning to tell time, and our 2 year old is learning her shapes. We love all the Melissa & Doug toys, because they are very durable and educational."
5,Christmas Clock or anytime clock,I really got this for my little cousin who I thought would like it. But instead his twin sister took it and played with it all Christmas night. So it is not gender specific. (Little girls are move advanced-proves the point).
5,"Great Toy, Great Gift!","I have given this toy as a gift many times and they all, including my own son, love this toy! It is educational, fun, and the reliable durability that Melissa and Doug is known for!"
1,Heavy and boring,I ended up returning this item because I was so disappointed. It weighed a ton so was awkward for a little one. It didn't really do anything. Putting the shapes in a box is way more fun than putting them in a little indent on the clock board. And anyone ready to tell time is way too old for this shape sorter. I normally love Melissa and Doug toys but this one just doesn't work.
1,clock,"real primative, no real dog toy made more for the younger child,it seems a bit simple minded for the age group they advertise to"
5,gft for a 1 year old,"I know this is probably not designed for a 1 year old, but this child loves to work with shapes and I know it will get used in many ways over the next few years...first as a shape sorter, and later to learn time. We like this toy."
4,Educational Tool,"Toy provides excellent opportunity for my 16 month old granddaughter to learn shapes, colors and time. She thoroughly enjoys it and often points to the clock on the wall to compare them. Appears well made and sturdy."
3,too much for toddlers,"my 3yr old mastered it in like 1hr although she asked why did we need a clock when she could just read it on the cell phone or the cable box, but does motivate my 2yr old to try picking the right shape and say the number out loud. Would give it a 5 except its kind of clunky (seems more like a classroom toy) and tedious to put away... I have to store the lettered numbers in a Ziploc bag."
4,Very Good but not Great,"Got this for my 2 year old for Christmas. I love the concept of this toy. My son LOVES clocks, he loves shapes, he loves numbers, he loves colors. It's a pretty sturdy toy, but the clock part is MDF not wood. Not that it makes it a bad toy, but it's only the SHAPES that are real wood, not the clock that the shape numbers go in. I just would have wanted to know that before purchasing. He doesn't know the difference of course, and he loves the toy,"
4,"Great clock, educational and fun.","My mom got this clock for my son's 4th birthday. He loves it. She would hide a couple numbers and ask him which ones were missing. The purple circle has the minutes written there to help children learn time. The hour and minute hand are labeled. I like that the numbers are different shapes, so a child can learn shapes too. Melissa & Doug toys are fun and educational! Well worth the buy."
3,It's a clock... and a puzzle...,"Congratulations, you've just bought a clock and a puzzle. Have fun keeping track of all of the pieces. Wooden toys are fun and simple. There was nothing too fancy about this product."
5,cute,"I love the clock so much for being wood, educational for learning time, colors, shapes. Pretty much the old fashioned way. I bought two!"
4,newbie,"The Melissa and Doug Wooden Shape Sorting Clock is great quality and great as a teaching tool. The 3yr old recipient of this gift enjoys it quite a bit. However, I was disappointed in the complexity of ordering this on the Amazon site. I only ordered one - or thought I only ordered one and received three of these clocks. The return procedure was extremely easy -- easy printable return label, but Amazon refused to refund postage on the return saying the error was my fault. I felt the error was due to the complex ordering. Therefore, the product ended up costing triple what was listed. Other than that-- the product was great."
3,Good product and appropriate for different ages,"We purchased this toy for our 2 year old. She is too young to get the ""clock"" part of it, but currently she is enjoying using it as a puzzle and matching the numbers on the puzzle pieces to the numbers on the clock. This toy should grow with her. Nice colors."
3,Fun and colorful but INACCURATE,"I agree with previous reviewer that this toy is fun and colorful, my 2-year-old loves it, but it makes me insane that the number 6 block is a pentagon and the number 5 block is a hexagon! Seriously, what would it have taken to just reverse those 2?This is also the case with their peg shapes -- but in that case, there are 4 blue pentagons on the number 4 peg and 5 red squares on the number 5 peg. They obviously went to some trouble to design these games and they're durable, appealing, etc. but HONESTLY, that's pretty sloppy user interface design!I, too, have written to Melissa & Doug to provide feedback, without response. That said, my son who turned 2 last week has now learned the words ""pinkagon"", ""eightagon"", and ""crapazoid"", thanks to this toy. :-)"
4,Solid toy with a few minor issues.,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter who was really into clocks at the time and she really enjoyed playing with this for a short time. It wasn't a toy that she went back to frequently.My biggest problem with it is that the blocks will fall out easily and get lost. To fix that problem, I bought some small Velcro stickers and put the hook side in the hole and the fuzzy side on the block. As long as you don't push too hard when placing them in, little kids can easily pull them out and put them back in and they stay with the clock when you're done playing with it.The paint is durable if it arrives in good condition. The paint on the face of the clock was smudged when I received it, but it was not bad enough to be worth the trouble of an exchange.It's lasted a long time, but unless you use it to teach shapes or telling time, it will probably just sit around your toy room taking up space."
4,Great clock: educational AND fun,"One of my kids is interested in telling time, and another is interested in shapes. They both like playing with this clock.I read a lot of reviews that complained that the 5 has six sides and the 6 has five sides. Mine must be a later model, because the 5 has five sides and the 6 has six sides. But even if they were the old way, I wouldn't have been bothered by this at all: the 2 has four sides and the 9 has four sides and the 10 has four sides and the 11 has four sides and the 12 has ten sides---so the number of sides don't correspond to the number on the shape, and they're clearly not supposed to."
5,My boys can't get enough of this toy!!,"We love this toy! While my boys are still a little young for the clock function of this, it is teaching them shapes, numbers and really just the basic look of the clock in general. Most of our clocks are digital so it's nice to have this to show them."
4,Excellent,"My daughter is three years old and she enjoys this toy a lot. I also like it a lot, since Emma can learn colors, shapes, numbers and the clock while playing with it."
3,Educational and Multipurpose,"I'm using this clock in therapeutic playroom. It is turning out to be used by the children to show their skills, increasing their pride and sense of accomplishment. Also, used frequently by anxious children to ask how long something (the session or visit) will be."
4,NEAT FOR OLDER CHILDREN,I got this for my 5 year old and it's a great toy. She likes to put the different shapes in the holes but isn't too interested in learning the time part of it. I have a 1 year old and she likes to get the pieces and put them all the way in her mouth so please beware around smaller children.
5,Wonderful learning toy from early toddler to Kindergarten,"I recently purchased this clock to teach my 5 year old how to tell time. I have an almost three year old as well. Both girls love it! Older daughter is learning about the minute and hour hands, o'clock and half past, while she teaches her younger sister about the shapes and colors. It is very sturdy and well-made as are all the items we have gotten in the Melissa & Doug line."
2,Researched a European recall on this product,"My child received this toy for Christmas even after we requested no toys made in China. I did my research to make sure I wasn't being overly obsessive and found that this exact clock was recalled in Europe last year for lead paint. Melissa & Doug makes their toys in China and feels the need to test them in China and again one they arrive in the US to ensure safe toys. We are returning this clock.We also have a puzzle from them and a push lawn mower. The puzzle makes animal noises when no one is near it, so we removed battery. The lawn mower was poorly made and has to be continually re-assembled so my child can play with it. I think the MD toys have good intentions, but poor execution."
3,"Nice toy, but probably for older kids",My daughter is 3 1/2 and hardly finds any use out of this toy. The only thing that interests her is putting the shapes in their correct spot. I don't think she's ready for time telling....
3,Toy looks great - however it was NOT made in America,"This year I wanted to donate items made in America for Marine Corps Toys for Tots. I was quite pleased to find that amazon had many items which they listed as made in America. You can imagine my disappointment when the clock arrived and was labeled 'made in China' Since I am donating the toy, not giving it to someone I know, I cannot comment on the quality or durability. Next year I will not trust amazon and will buy everything directly from U.S. manufacturers, as I did this year with K'nex Lincoln Logs - which ARE made in America."
4,Very versatile,"I bought this clock for my 2 year old to learn shapes, numbers, colors... & for my 5 year old to work on telling time. I actually relearned a few shapes I hadn't thought of in a while :) My kids like the puzzle aspect the best, but I think this is a great learning tool & is definately very sturdy."
5,"Had it 7 years. Nice to see they have changed the ""5"" and ""6"" shapes.","I'm glad they made the ""5"" shape a pentagon and the ""6"" shape a hexagon -- it always bugs my kids that those are mixed up.We have the old version of this toy, so I can speak for its durability. It's basically impossible to harm this toy. There is some minor wear to the shaped pieces, but the hands and the clock base and the pieces themselves look like only one very careful child has ever played with it. Heh ... Instead of my boisterous boys. Seven years of use, and still going strong.I got it out this week to teach my kindergartener how to tell time. Actually, the brothers worked together and made up a game with homemade flashcards to teach the little one. Great review for older kids, great way to learn for younger kids.Just a great toy, a great value. I'll probably hang onto this until my kids have kids."
5,What a great buy!,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter, who likes identifying shapes. This set has all the basics and then some (a parallelogram, trapezoid are included). Beyond that it also identifies quarter-hour, half-past and quarter-til, the minute and hour hands, and provides 60-step increments (seconds or minutes). Brightly colored and quite a grow-with-you educational piece that we will be using for my 13 month old too! Side Note: Not sure where one of the previous reviewers saw an incorrect photo depicting a hexagon marked 5 and a pentagon marked 6, but the photo I see corresponds to our set which correctly identified hexagon and pentagon."
4,Educational Wood Toys,"I really like this toy. It's durable, has lots of items to learn from, and the kids ranging from 4-8 can learn from this. The colors are bright so that makes it fun for kids, catches their eyes."
4,Good sturdy starter clock,"The puzzle is sturdy wood, various shapes, different colors and provides a good starter clock to familiarize toddlers with time. My twin boys like it very much."
5,"Fun ""clock"" & good for shapes, colors & numbers too...","My 2 yr old and 5 yr old enjoy playing with this ""clock"". It's good for the 2 yr old for shapes, colors and numbers and good for my 5 yr old to practice telling time! They like to lose the pieces frequently, but other than that, great buy!"
5,Well made,"This is well made, colorful and has different shapes too! Can't wait for her to open it on Christmas morning!"
3,A Problem with Two of the Shapes,"I love that this clock combines the functions of shape-sorting and telling time, and in that respect, I think it will be a great toy for several years. We've found a problem with the shape sorting function. The hexagon piece actually fits into the octogon slot well enough that it seems (to a two-year-old) to be correct. Then he only finds out it's wrong when he struggles to get the octogon into the hexagonal slot. Very frustrating! Melissa and Doug may have corrected this--I'm not sure--but if that's the case, Amazon still sells models like this."
2,"Great subject, poor style, bad Kindle editing","The subject is excellent and the feel of realism is good, but there are many points where it seems like someone dropped the ball. The point of narration seems to almost randomly switch from first person to 3rd person at times in a confusing way. My main complaint is that, once again, I have a purchased a Kindle edtion of a book that is not fully Kindle functional. There is no way to advance by chapter or go to a specific location, no table of contents and no ability to go anywhere other than the next page or previous page. If you want to check out a certain part of the book, the only way to reach it is one page at a time. Amazon needs to start cracking down on crap like this, it's far too common. We, as buyers, also need to complain more frequently or nothing will change. In spite of these issues I would have to give this subject matter and the stories told 5 stars for excitement."
3,"got rather boring after a while, same stories over and over","got rather boring after a while, seem like same stories after a while.I have always been interested in true stories but sometime they go on and on about the same thing."
1,Over the fence,"I found ths book boring and dragged out. I have read a lot of Nam books some edge of the seat good ,Many very good , some just ok , but not many boring sorry just didn't do it"
5,a well balanced read,"This is a first person account of the secret war our Green Berets fought ""over the fence"" in Laos and Cambodia. It gives the reader an incredible feel for what it was like to be there. That anyone could do what they did, day in day out, and not lose their minds is almost unbelievable.The book is written in a very matter-of-fact style, and the author does not try to embellish the facts or interject his opinions about the ""big picture"".I highly recommend this book for someone who just wants to get an appreciation for ""what it was like out there"" and does not want a whole lot of editorializing."
5,Across the fence,As someone said were do we find these people. They lay it all out for us then get dropped. We did this Viet Nan and we still do it today.thank you john Meyer for leaving a mark for history .and thanks for covering my butt.Davidcfaulkner@gmail
2,Intelligent Writing for the New Web,"The wireless web is expected to eclipse the wired Internet and it is difficult to find books that treat the many emerging forms of this technology well. The book is easy to read, and ranges over both the practical and the theoretical in a well balanced and useful manner. With the many connections and devices forming the new wireless web, Peter Alesso and Craig Smith outline and describe the key underpinnings and implications that every technologist and business person should be aware of. This book is useful to business and technology planning. It details the relevant and hard to get information about the emerging wireless technology. With intelligence, it goes further to sensibly describe my favorite parts - the challenges and opportunities of each technology. I recommend it to any senior technology professional - aspiring or already practicing."
5,new age dolphins,"This book is good for new agers...the author is a bit naive, but very well-written. Enjoyed the book for some of her insights; but did not take it very seriously. Enjoyable read!"
1,High Beings Need Less Human Invasion and More True Peace,"The dolphins in this book are wild, but are being harassed increasingly by humans who want something from them. They are now being seen with less frequency in many of the bays they use for calving, resting, nursing - scientists relate this to human intensive (although mostly unintentional) swimmers and other recreationists who think the dolphins have nothing else to do but to commune with them. As if those humans are that special."
1,Chicabiddy BORRING!,"I'm 11 and I'm insulted that some one thinks we're this un-sufisticaded! Also, I found that this story, is just made out of other books. There are parts from: Walk two moons, Absolutely normal chaos, Are you there god? its me margarett, The quilt trilogy, and more! And, since I've started, let me tell you! If there is an 11 year old in the world, who wrote such a stupid news paper, or had such an eventfull summer (GIVE ME A BRAKE! I'M 11 AND MORE THEN A HALF, AND I DONT KNOW ONE PERSON WITH A SUMMER LIKE THAT!)Then I'm 1,000 years old!!!! If you want a good fiction story for a girl ages 10 to 13, get the Sharon Creech books, or the Linda Ellerbee books in the ""Get Real"" storys. Or for an older girl, Star girl! Dont buy this book!"
2,Confused,"This book is okay, considering a 10-year-old wrote it who has no sense of originality. I have no problem with a 10-year-old writing a book, I think that itself is awesome but I didn't like her style of writing. This book is very much like other books that I've read like Walk Two Moons, Are you there god? It's me Margaret, and Absoulutly normal chaos. In my opinion, authors should at least have the brain abiblity to think up there own characters names and try not to make it a replecca of a different book(s). Plus, Emma wrote this book when she was ten, not having any experience to what the characters did in the book. The main character is only 11 and had some experiences 14 year olds may not have had yet. Not very realistic.For sure NOT one of my favorite books."
2,Published proof of plagerism!,"I have had an interest in literature since I was very young, and when I saw this book on the shelf of my school library, I thought it would be fascinating to read a book by a child of ten. I have heard of teens who started writing at fifteen or so (such as S.E. Hinton)but to think that a child so young go throught the rather dismal process of editing and such was amazing-right? WRONG!! The Diary of Chickabiddy Baby was total and complete plagerism. There were parts of the award winning Walk Two Moons and the much acclaimed Absoloutly Normal Chaos by Sharon Creech, and the hilarious Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret by Judy Blume. The Tricycle Press publishor company who printed this book for the whole world to read must either be blind, or ignorent of Sharon Creech. Theis is a waste of precious time and money. If you want a great book for children 10+, I reccomend THe Wind Singer by William Nicholson."
1,"""A highly original and sophisticated piece for such a young author!""...not.","A friend purchased this book for me a while back, and I knew by the time that I'd read the first sentence that I was not in for an entertaining time. The entire book was completely insulting to my intelligence; it was so saturated with plagiarism that it flabbergasted me as to how such a book could have been published in the first place. However, I do readily congratulate the young author for having the courage to write this book and have it published without getting sued by certain better-established authors. I hope the author will continue to write in the future, as she certainly demonstrates considerable promise, as long as her future works don't borrow pages word-for-word from other books."
2,???!!!!,"this book was such a total copy of walk two moons, absouloutly normal chaos and are you there god? it's me margaret.if i hadn't read those books before i read this though, i would've liked it way better. this isn't such a bad book, or at least for a ten year old, but i think she should have been original."
1,cult classic?,"weird. I think if I was in a cult and was forced to listen to it, then I might grow to like it. Just not my taste."
3,"This is not by the band, ""Breakfast Included""","I arrived at this CD from a link on the page for the band, ""Breakfast Included""(http://www.amazon.com/Breakfast-Included/dp/artist-redirect/B002B1OY3U)). However this CD does not have any music at all by that band. Nor does it even mention ""Breakfast Included"".It has some okay music, but it's not at all what I was expecting."
5,The DEFINITIVE book on the Blackbird,"If you want one book on the history, development, and flight operations of the Habu, this is the one to get. This is just one incredible encyclopedia on the SR-71. The text reads well, and there are some excellent picture sections throughout the book. Paul Crickmore has established himself as the one true expert on this remarkable and nearly fifty year old masterpiece of Kelly Johnson's Skunk Works. One cannot help but think how much of the research and testing that went into the SR-71 laid the ground work for Felix Baumgartner's record-breaking high altitude parachute jump in October 2012. I was fortunate enough to pick up a copy of pilot Brian Shul's book ""Sled Driver"" years ago, and these two books probably represent your best bet for a solid knowledge of the Blackbird, as well as a wealth of great color photographs."
5,Learning to read is fun!,"We have purchased other Brand New Readers sets, and have never been disappointed yet. Our kids (5 1/2 year old son and almost 3 year old daughter) love the simple stories and illustrations, and while our son is sounding out the words, his little sister is enthusiastically shouting out the story based on the picture clues and memorization. They both feel a huge sense of accomplishement when they read to us, and we all love the humor used in the stories. Move over Dick and Jane; Brand New Readers make learning how to read fun!"
4,Brand /new /reader,"Our five year old grandson likes these because they offer a certificate of acheivement and stickers as a reward for completing the book.Before he reads it ,we review the new words."
5,Great Reader Books,"Two of our children- both on different phases of learning to read- delight in these books. The younger one is able to memorize the storylines and have a sense of success, our older one can truly look and decipher the language in the books. We have 4 different sets and like them all. A great tool on the road to learning to read."
1,dumb or dumber,"if you spend money on crap cd's like this rap crap, you deserve the future you will not have.....who is dumber? those who listen to it or those that pay for it and listen to it?"
4,Schirm; Charme und Melone,"The Avengers were and still are very popular in germany, too and I am glad to get hold of all the episodes. I personally would have liked the DVDs subtitled since english is not my native language and I do not get all the lines of the witty conversations. What I also object is that the original film material is often quite unclean, spots and scratches should have been removed digitally before putting the episodes on DVD. That is my only objection, I am really glad to have these TV treasures on DVD."
5,Brings back fond memories,"This set brings back fond memories of watching The Avengers with the rain beating down outside during my childhood in London. For those of you who like The Prisoner (McGoohan) for the surreal situations, coupled with humor and early James Bond type plots on a smaller scale, don't miss this set!"
4,Steed and Peel -- you either get it or you just don't,"Like a lot of classic TV, this show's appeal (ahem) is hard to explain to the uninitiated. To call the plots outlandish would be gratuitous understatement; they border on cartoonish. Yet, somehow ""The Avengers"" never cease to be contagiously watchable. There's some sophisticated interplay bubbling just beneath the silly surface between Macnee and Rigg, which one may choose to ignore. Or one can overthink the whole exercise (fear of new technology is a recurring theme), and still extract a lot of enjoyment. Watch a few episodes on the Starz Mystery channel; if you decide you in fact ""get it,"" then get this DVD set."
5,The Avengers - The Complete Emma Peel Megaset,"I have loved this television show since the 1960s. The Emma Peel shows, I feel, were the best. A touch of mystery, a touch of tongue-in-cheek, and a whole lot of the ""bubbly""."
4,The Avengers - nice jump back in time,"The series has gotten a little old-fashioned... but the stories are still quite funny, and the rythm interesting. I liked the characters a lot when younger... so a good moment to watch them again."
5,ESSENTIAL Emma Peel Megaset is sensational!,"Incredibly pleased with the quality of this item! Kudos to A&E; for a job well-done! Discs are well-sequenced, and the menus are simple and easy to navigate. Reproduction from the original sources has been done faithfully, and the clarity is even more vivid than on the VHS tapes, which were excellent for their time. Emma Peel and John Steed have never looked or sounded so good!!Practically speaking, the chapters are well-organized, so that you can skip past the main title or the credits easily without missing any of the story. The bonus disc was a terrific addition, too! This will occupy a treasured place in my collection!"
3,CD Single Contents,"This CD single (Gasoline Alley 54596) contains the Radio Remix of the song ""Comforter"", and also excerpts from the songs ""Baby I'm Yours,"" ""Sexual,"" and ""Waiting For The Day."""
1,Watch no good to get wet,"I jumped in my daughters pool and forgot to take the watch off and it is now not working as it has water in it,It is water resistant to 100m.I have a watch I got for 5.39 at Walmart and have worn it in the shower many times and it is still going...."
5,Mythology class book,This was a book that I read for a Mythology and Folklore class. I liked the book because it was easy to read and it contained a lot of history. Having the background information to accompany the stories was helpful and made the reading more interesting. Highly recommended.
4,Myth and Knowing,"This is a book I could recommend for teaching about mythology. It is well laid out and has a lot of good background information that is excellent for teaching purposes. Mythology is a class I teach at the community college level. My greatest fault with it, though, is that there were not enough actual stories in it for a broad study of the different archetypes. If you are a beginner at teaching mythology, this may be the book for you. It is well written and definitely academic in tone.If however, you are more experienced at teaching this subject, you may want to consider a book that is more of an anthology of mythical stories to give a broader base experience.This is one of the better academic mythology books on the market, but could use more actual myths to lift it a notch towards perfection for teaching purposes."
4,Introduction to world mythology,Great book for someone who wants to be introduced to general mythology of cultures around the world. Very easy to read. Thorough explanations.
1,Martin Landau should fire his agent for putting him in this!,"I bought this video because I'm a big fan of Martin Landau, but after seeing this film, I think he should fire his agent! This film was obviously made on a very low budget and it shows. The dialogue is so stiff it has splinters. I felt bad for Martin Landau, you could tell he knew this was a bad film, but he probably needed the money as this was made before his 'comeback' in ""Ed Wood"". Speaking of Ed Wood, he was a better director than the guy who directed this stinker. I'm just glad Landau has moved on to bigger and better films and he no longer has to make garbage like this to pay his bills."
1,Breaks too much,We purchased this toy for my son. Within one month of having it we have had to repair it three times. My child has lost intrest in this toy because it breaks too often.
2,scooter,"This scooter has been very easy to use for my 3 year old. Unfortunately, after only a short while, the lights and sound broke on the scooter and can not be fixed. My son is very disappointed and wants a scooter that works."
2,scooter,"As soon as we put it together, the handle bar broke and son was not able to ride it. Just bought a whole different one."
4,Great if bought for $5. at a garage sale,"I hope that this toy makes it through the plays of my 2 grandchildren intact with its motor cycle sounds, flashing lights and all."
2,"Junk, and dangerous!","We bough this scooter believing the three-wheel design and urethane wheels would provide safety. Wrong!The scooter tips very easily, the wheels are hard and don't ride smoothly as would rollerblades or a skateboard, and the turning front wheel/handle design is an accident waiting to happen. The rear wheels are covered by plastic fenders molded into the riding platform that make it difficult for a toddler to place their ""pushing"" foot onto the platform. Also, the reving sound on this particular Harley-designed model gets nervewrecking after only a few minutes. We removed the batteries.If you're seeking a scooter for toddlers (ages 3-4), look for a different model with a lower, flatter platform and softer wheels."
1,Accident waiting to happen!,"My som got this scooter for his birthday and what a waste of money. My [...] has been riding scooter's since he was 18 months. This scooter has the worse design. There is not even enough room to barely get one foot on the scooter and the way the back wheels are designed it makes it very difficult for a child to even get his foot on it. It also tips over very very easily. My [...] nephew tried it and as soon as he turned it, it flipped over (and he also is used to riding scooters). This toy is a waste of money. I threw it out. I wouldn't dare give it to another child. Oh and the noises it makes - will drive parents crazy. I have bought other Harley Davidson products and thought they were made very well. This is just a waste of money!"
3,Cute book but didn't hold my daughter's attention,I purchased this book to help my daughter get over her fear of the Dr.'s office. The book is cute but the story just didn't hold her attention. She ended up walking away about one third of the way into it.
4,great book,who doesn't love these books! great book for kids of all ages and always have a little lesson to learn:)
5,Check-up,"Its the cubs time for their first check-up. Sister is VERy nervous, but both of them are worried because they thing that they might get a shot.It is a good book to read to your kids if they are going to be going for their first check-up or anytime."
3,Princess dress up,My daughter loves to play dress up and welcomed this to her collection. Only downside is that it's a bunch of 2 piece costumes that make 1 dress vs. the normal 1 piece dress. Cute set.
1,too small for intended age,"I would really recommend this for a girl at least 3 years old, but the clothes are so small it's more like they are for a baby. They should be big enough to put on over regular clothes, but no such luck here. Also, the velcro on the back makes it necessary to help. If they were really making something educational, at least make them so they are easy for the girls to change themselves. My 4 year old was frustrated and we quickly donated these ""costumes""."
1,DISNEY PRINCESS DRESS,"SIZE TOO SMALL. DESCRIPTION SAID TO FIT 3 TO 5 YEAR OLD GIRL, BUT IN REALITY ONLY FITS SIZE 1 OR 2 PETITE."
1,dresses are for dolls not kids,My daughter was very excited when I first showed her the cute outfits but only one or two skirts fit. I had to take away the small accessories so my youngest wouldn't find it(and eat it). trunk is not worth a dime unless you want to dress your child's dolls.
4,Little Girls will love it.,My grand daughter loves it and there are four outfits so her friends can play.
4,it keeps going and going....,"i've used this chain for hours and it's just now starting to get dull. every other chain I've had would require sharpening each gas fill up. I was so happy with it, I bought another one as a back up."
4,Soft TRA works to a point,Software is easy to load. It is somewhat intuitive. It has many useful tools but more frequencies could be displayed when using the 1/3 octave audio analyzer. It would make it much easier to pick out the frequencies that cause feedback when setting up a room. The 1/6 octave maybe a more usable option. Will consider it.
3,you still need an interpreter for the responses....,"This would be most useful to someone with a few Spanish courses under their belt who needs to brush up (see first 2 chapters) plus medical jargon and practical medical terminology and questions. The phonetic pronunciation is a help but seems more Castillian than Hispanic as Americans would use more often. It is very thorough with the questions so it would be useful to a non speaker in an emergency room AND doctor's office or hospital if there was no interpreter available. It would take a while to look up the correct question and then you might not understand the patient's response if you didn't have an interpreter. Questions to ask over the phone such as ""What is the injury?"" won't help much if you don't understand the response. Good for practicing I guess and trying to improve your second language skills."
3,General needs,This book is a generalized spanish translator for health care professionals with little to no spanish skills. It is not specific to any specialty in health care. The key word here is very general. I did not find it to be helpful as my needs are specific to oncology.
1,Not a fan,"Sorry, I am not a fan of this particular book. I have taken very lilttle away from it and frequently put it down after starting it. On the plus side it is an easy read with most entries a few sentences and then the next one follows. I find each chapter like reading fifty fortunes from a bowl of Fortune Cookies. Maybe it's not for me b/c I am not interested in defeating anyone, rather leading within a school."
4,Rich with meaning,"Krause translates each paragraph of each chapter of the Art of War into simple and easy to read business language. On the first read, it may seem almost too simple. But on the second and third reads, the deeper meaning began to shine through. I suspect I will uncover some new insight with every reading."
4,"A Simple, Useful Guide",What I liked about Krause's book was the way he explains the teachings of Sun Tzu for the simple folk. He wrote the book to help the business man or woman. It helped me see the deeper lessons Sun Tzu has to offer as well--lessons about life.
2,Weak on all counts,"Pretty much bottom of the heap for available productions of The Magic Flute. The Behrens review is right on target in most respects, although I can't think why he gave it 4 stars. Average singing, racism (typical, however for Europeans in 1992, who still thought racist images were cute - they are just getting it now), boring production, not really modern or post-modern, just simple-minded. My sympathy to all the people who worked hard under poor management. Nevertheless, it's only for those whose curiosity gets the better of them."
1,Not what I expected,"Unimpressive as to the quality of this musical presentation, and it is not staged as I would have expected. I wanted to learn more about this opera, having neglected to add it to my collection. From this version, I did not get a picture of what Mozart must have had intended. Maybe I should have read the description better. Having searched for a desirable version, I passed over the Met's presentation. More expensive is not necessarily better. Note that Amazon recommends ordering these two together. What I experienced tells me why they recommend buying two versions of the same opera. I missed getting a discounted price. Do order both, if you order this one."
5,better than I expected,"I have read the other 2 reviews and don't understand them. I picked this book up at the library, quite by accident. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the characters were well written and that it wasn't your usual formula romance. This is one of those rare books that you pass along to friends."
2,Will not suggest to anyone.,"Not a very good text for beginners. There are other good books like the ones by Mendelson, A. Margaris and tons of others."
5,Everyone should read this outstanding book.,"I am very selective about books I choose to buy and display; I prefer those that can really make a difference or illustrate a method or a new perspective. Mack's book does an excellent job of debunking and explaining the Christian myth and deserves widespread reading. If superstition and myth can be recognized and understood as such, society will be strengthened and enriched.It is like the Emperor's New Clothes - someone has pointed at the Emperor and written an accessible and enlightening book on the subject."
3,"Wrong title, right subtitle.","The subtitle of this densly written book should be the title. Who Wrote the New Testament is a very densely written book full of interesting speculations on the evolution of early Christianity and the New Testament. The author presumes the reader has at least some knowledge of textual critism before reading this book, for example he discusses how the three edits(?), revisions(?) of the Q document affected the early Christ Cult, without describing the evolution of the document itself or the evidence for the various changes in Q.I did not find the writing style to be very engaging and often found my brain tuned out as I was reading.If you've got a strong foundation in the development New Testament Criticism, and you want speculation on the origin of the beliefs that make up Orthodox Christianity, this book may be for you.If you're looking for a review of where the books of the New Testament came from and why they were included in the Cannon, I sugguest you keep looking."
4,Great survey,"The text was chock full of information new to me. I especially appreciated the historical details and perspectives. His lack of attribution or sometimes scanty attribution such as; ""Herman taught us.... (Herman, 1965)"" reminded me of Eusibius."
3,Title Misleading,The biggest problem I have with this book is the title. It is misleading. It is not about who wrote the new testament. It is NOT a good sequel to Richard E. Friedman's excellent 'Who Wrote the Bible' (which only covers the Old Testament). It is an exploration of the history of Christianity and does put the gospel writings into some context. But I was disappointed that it didn't live up to the title.I think this book is more for those looking to explore more about Christian traditions and writings and less for those looking for answers to the the question on the front cover.
2,Scholarship lacking.,"Disappointing. This is way too off the cuff for a subject that needs objective treatment. Poorly written and not well documented. Short on specifics. If you want to know about this period, see the books of Ehrman or Pagels.Doesn't satisfy anyone who wants to seek knowledge.It is written more like a speach than an essay.Only 4 pages of works cited. No footnotes. Few parenthetical links.This would get a D grade in Theology 101.I think I agree with what he says, but could not support that view as he documents it.Definitly not a book to refute Bible Thumpers with.Choose any of the books by Bart Ehrman, if you are interested in this subject. Ehrman is more objective and coherent."
1,Opinions and bias,"There are many reviews of this book that are on target. I will keep mine short. The author of the book is hostile to Christianity and hides behind supposed scholarship. The book is largely biased opinions. If one strains, one can find some useful information. For anyone who wants to see the author's bias most clearly, get a copy of the book and look at the last page of the last chapter. There, the author puts forth such an absurd anti-Christian, anti-Bible, and anti-American vision that the rest of the book is put clearly into the context from which the author writes. I read the whole book, looking for a few nuggets, but finding few. My recommendation is that this book is not worth reading and certainly not worth buying."
1,who wrote the new testament,"I agree with the historian. I am not religious but as an avid reader of New testamnet books, and as a teacher of history and arceology, I can say that this book is more of the authors assumptions and imagination with no evidence whatsoever. He takes you on a long trip of his obviously suspiciousmind. Very dark mind I would say. Bottom line: DONT BOTHER!"
1,You should also read...,"You should also read ""The Case For Christ"". It is a story of a devout atheist's crusade to disprove the divinity of Jesus only to end up a believer in Him."
2,Not for casual reading...,"The title is deceptively simple. The subject is anything but.I don't recall where I saw this book discussed, however, clearly, it was a scholarly article.I cannot speak to the credentials of the author, therefore, I won't get into critiquing style, content, organization, etc...Let's just say, this was one that missed my interest...."
2,It was... sort of OK. I reckon.,"As a reader and collector of books on the subject, especially Pre- and Early Christian History, I just *had* to get this book. (I didn't get it at Amazon, however. Sorry, guys.)I am torn on how to treat the book. In one sense, it is a fascinating theory put forth, not only by the author but a great many others. Lots of stuff to back it up. On the other hand, he tends to interpret things, take things a certain way when it suits, and that just turns me off to quite a chunk of the book. It's not even *close* to better books on the subject, but it isn't a bad read, in the end.I think the author could have done a substantially better job being honest to where the evidence (and lack thereof) led. Instead, I believe he started with a destination in mind, and that's bad scholarship."
2,The author is too dogmatic with his views.,Mr Mack has his views but doesn't allow for differing opinions. It is his belief that the authors of the Gospels tailored their writings for their audience and copied from earlier authors. It just may be possible that the Gospel author's individuality and writing style was the determinant. Mack never allows for the possibilty that the stories about Jesus might be true and not myths.
5,A great read,"This book, which was the subject of a Master Piece Theater presentation is witty and fun to read. Even though it is a work of fiction, The story takes the reader directly into the world of the RAF early in the war."
2,Hammer House of Horror Television series,"The price for Hammer House of Horror at US$62 is extravagant. Believe it or not this box set was available in Australia for AU$14.95 at Easydvd,Eastlands shopping mall store,Ringwood Australia. It is poor compared withHammer Films from the late 1950's to mid 70's which are very good.The Silent Scream and Children of the Full Moon were ok. Two stars."
4,An excellent collection. Totally worth the price.,"Bought this one on a whim. Looked interesting and I didn't know anything about the series. Basically, you get 10 hours of television episodes. The shows are very good. Like 10 mini-films. I wish they had TV shows of this quality in the United States. They seem a lot more open-minded, too, about what they censor in the U.K. Which is very refreshing. The shows don't get gory, but they also don't shy away from violence and nudity. A lot more humor in the writing, also, that you would not expect. I recommend this highly. Especially considering how much you get for the cost."
3,"Good, but could be better written","This book is meticulously thought through and very persuasively argued. But it lacks the eloquent writing of E.O. Wilson, or Matt Ridley. Fortunately, it's short."
5,An Excellent Text on ADHD,"The first edition of ""Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder : A Handbook for Diagnosis and Treatment"" was generally considered a must-read for all Clinical Child Psychologists and other practitioners who worked or planned to work with children with behavior disorders. The second edition is even better, as it should be. This edition clarifies how we have learned much about ADHD in the past decade. The book's coverage of relevant literature, findings, and data-based theories and treatments makes it one of the very best books on ADHD available on the market. I recommend it to all who plan to work with behavior-disordered children. Also, this text should be in most public libraries to allow parents the opportunity to read accurate writings about ADHD."
5,"Impressive, touching, thought-provoking","I saw this documentary in a theatre when it showed in NY and remember being so impressed with what the filmmaker had been able to do. She wove her own personal story into the broader story of other womens' lives, and marriage in general, and it made for a really interesting movie. Some of the moments she captured (like a birthday party for her boyfriend where his ex-girlfriend was also there) were just fascinating. Totally worthwhile to see this movie."
5,Superb Documentary!! Nina Davenport Rules!!,This superb documentary of marriage and relationships rules!! It is highly reccommended!!It will broaden your horizons!!Yeah Babe!!
1,beautiful but very cheaply made,I brought two of these bracelets for my sister n bff but when i recieved it was very excited until i open the package and felt how cheap the material was made almost like the kind of stuff u will find in a bubble gum machine will not return them bc the shipping will be about the cost of bracelets will never buy anything else from this company
4,Very sweet,"Lovely gift, for some special sisters who are my best friends , the bracelet is elegant with a pretty dangling heart big hit!"
2,eh,"bought this for my little sister for Christmas.. still haven't sent it though because it looks cheap, and I had to take some beads off because it was even too big for me . I'm 18 and she will be 13 In February. I think next time I will buy a bracelet in stores, or make one myself."
5,love!!,"Beautifully wrapped! Im giving this to a close friend of mine and it is very well made! And for such a low price to, its a great gift Im tempted to buy one myself cause they are just so well made and pretty!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Initially, my dog liked this, and she was very active and healthy on it. I believe after the first bag was done, and i bought a second, i must have gotten one that was manufactured after Procter & Gamble bought the company. The food started giving my dog diarreah and she will not touch it. I have read SEVERAL negative reviews on other sites regarding this brand and dogs getting very sick. i DO NOT recommend this."
5,Great food for any meat eating animals with alergies,I tried 20 different dog foods for my Maltese that are prone to allergies.With this food they get to eat less and maintain their optimum weight.The Maltese stopped scratching and biting himself. I have read on many web sites that the Evo diet is the best in the world. My Maltese and my Golden Retriever maintained there ideal weight and their coats were beautiful.The food is a bit more expensive than the junk food with all the fillers but my dogs are worth it. With a little research you can find it at great prices.The main thing is if you have any dog with allergies this will cure it.Good luckMike Griffin
4,Very useful if you have a good mathematical background!,"I found this book very useful for a better comprehension of Markov chains and for understanding the theory, but you need a very good knowledge of mathematics like calculus, matrix, differential equations and statistics in order to keep going in your reading. Don't expect full numerical examples, be ready for demostrations! I recommend it for students interested in stochastic processes or looking a good approach to the basis of Markov processes."
4,Heroes,"This 2 disc set chronicles the lives and mysteries surrounding Abraham, Joseph, King David and Jesus. Through use of biblical references and actual historical facts the veiwer gets to know these heroic figures better."
2,carlos,Very simple stories about well known tales of the bible.I expected added value from this films
4,An awesome bike for kids!,"I bought this bike as a birthday gift for my 2 year old son and he loves riding it from day 1. It was unbelievable how a 2 year old toddler can quickly learn how to maneuver and ride this bike. The mechanics and functions are so easy for toddlers to pick up and the overall design was awesome. The way my 2 year old ride this bike I thought he is ready now to shift into high speed. But when I tried hooking up the high speed connector, I found out that it was defective. I followed every instructions on the manual but it really has a defective high speed mechanics. It was just one of those things, you just bought a defective one and I understand that, at least I know my 2 year old loves this bike. He only had this bike for less than 3 weeks so I will just return it and exchange for a new one. I will not get a different bike for my boy, this bike is awesome!"
4,Great toy good durability,"The battery lasts as long as can be expected for a toy like this. It is frustrating when the battery is out because the kids love to use it so much. The rest of the toy has sustained jumps, hills, and ditches (within the toys limits of course) and my youngest son loves it. It was too small for my older son so we had to get him a Peg Perego brand. But the boys equally love to ride them. The only time my son isn't on it is when the battery is charging (yes, he's practicing his tricks when it's out of commission)."
3,For beginners? Not really.,"This visually appealing book - the coil binding is great - has some great recipes, but not for beginners. Real beginners will not be making Asian Dumpling Soup or Fettuccine Alfredo, unless it comes frozen on a microwavable dish covered in plastic. Beginners want to know how to scramble and boil eggs, make buttered noodles, and BLTs. Beginners tend to buy their ingredients at the Gas N' Sip on the way home from class. So, change the book's audience description to the sophisticated, middle level cook, who is now ready to throw dinner parties for her future in-laws or her fellow book club members. This book gets higher marks as an intermediate cookbook and, in that context, it is quite nice.50 Ways to Leave Your Mother"
4,"A solid beginners' cookbook, tailored well to its audience","Cookbooks are always kind of hit-or-miss for me--I'm a male in my twenties, kind of a picky eater, and often have more ambition than equipment or knowhow. I bought this cookbook when I had my first kitchen in college, and four years later I still consider it one of my better purchases. This is not a particularly large cookbook, but it has a thorough tips section at the beginning, and the recipes it does have are a good representative sample for beginners and can be altered as the chef gets braver and more creative. If you can make a party-dip, roast a chicken, bread and pan-fry pork cutlets, and make cranberry sauce, you can get pretty far as a college student."
2,Practically useless for the average student!,"I bought this for my daughter who has almost no time to cook and is on a tight budget. What college student just happens to have a bag of avocadoes, asian dumplings, or fresh basil leaves lying around? The recipes in here are strong on the hippie vegetarian San Francisco side rather than the ""top ramen"" quick fix side. What a college student really needs is ideas of what to do with NORMAL ingredients and items that can be stocked without going bad. This book may be better for someone who actually has some interest in the ""art"" of cooking rather than just getting something on the healthy side in your stomach quickly. I guess I will keep looking for a true college student cookbook."
4,Helpful for poor college students!,"This book is a good cookbook for poor, mac and cheese eating college students. The receipes are easy to follow and cheap to make. The only thing I didn't like about it was that is was too short...more receipes please!"
5,Gorgeous!,"This ring is gorgeous! I love love love it! I have incredibly tiny hands so I have to have a small delicate looking rings so they don't look too big (I wear a size 5). The stone is a little bit of a brighter blue than in the picture, but it is a lovely color. I would recommend this ring to anyone that has small hands. Oh and to be so tiny it sure is durable! I am going to try to upload a picture..."
4,Good intro to security for management & non-technical users,"Computer security is not rocket science, but it is often so hard to secure a computer, that is seems like rocket science. Have You Locked the Castle Gate? Home and Small Business Computer Security is a book made for the average user, who may not be so technical, yet wants to have a somewhat secure computer.The book is short on theory and get straight to the point with specific and practical ways to secure a system.This book outlines the fundamental concepts and techniques for most users. The book details the most common security issues facing users and small businesses today.The reader won't be a security guru after reading the book, but will be familiar with concepts such as encryption, authentication, viruses and worms, registry, event logs and more.Those looking for a to the point book on what they need to know about home and small business security for their computers will find significant value in the book."
5,Review 2,Order arrived on time and in perfect condition. Our teachers were very pleased with the stools. All items were as promised.
4,great small stools,"These 24"" stools are very sturdy, but the seat is a bit slippery. They are the perfect size for my counter top overhang. There are no blemishes in the white paint. They look great in my newly remodeled kitchen and cost far less than those at stores. They are a very good buy."
5,Quality barstool for a great price.,I ordered 4 of them and they are great. Perfect height. Great price!!
5,Great Bar Stools,Good Quality for the price. Was not protected well for shipping but there was no damaged. Would recommend.
5,barstools,stools very well built and i use them every day and nothing seems to losen the legs or cause them to wiggle would recomend them to others
3,Good Toy,The stuff animal of Brian is fine toy to have if you are a fan of Family GuyThe right ear on my is different from the picture that is on this website.
3,Sirius Ready?,I got this because it was Sirius ready but I have yet to figure out what Sirius reciever will connect to it
2,Common sense lacking,"The bath seat was easy to put together and satisfactory to use. But some of the metal hardware that was provided for use in assembling the seat was not rust-proof, and rusted after several weeks of use. It makes no sense to make a product used under water that contains metal parts that are not rust-proof."
3,Good Enough for the Price,"We put the chair together and sat on it. It was stable and sturdy which is what you want. But, it was a pain to put together. Most likely a more expensive chair would have been easier to assemble."
2,Serviceable if Care is Taken,"I bought this while recovering from spine surgery for use in a fairly large shower (it's probably a bit large for most tubs). I still use it from time to time. However, unless one is able-bodied with no balance issues, I would not recommend it. Simply put, the lack of bracing among the legs leaves the seating structure wobbly and somewhat unstable. Lowering the seat platform in relation to the legs helps, to some degree. However, caveat emptor."
5,Wake up call!,"How far we have fallen! One example in this book shows how easy it is for good people to spiral into debt and disarray if you break one ""rule."" Breaking one rule leads down the path to all of the new rules and those rules fall like dominoes. The laws that protect us are punitive, while those who make the rules win the game. This book makes a clear case to take back our rights, before they are all gone. Thank you for the wake up call!"
5,Best Ever,"This is a high quality product. I have used other brands trying to imitate this product however they do not come close. This HHS 2000 lube, sprays-out thin and runny, then as it dries it has a thicker grease constancy. When you can't get grease into hard to reach areas, this does the trick. It penetrates then thickens up. Highly recommend it. Worth the price!"
4,Tube Too Short,The only complaint I have about this item is that the tube which comes with it is only about two inches long. This makes it very difficult to get into the right position to spray on some of the bushings on my truck. I can't really speak as to the effectiveness of this lube as it turned out to be something else which was causing the noise in my front end.
2,not good value,"after placing equiptment in case,closing,noticed later back panel poped out.I epoxided and is holding.I had purchased from 47th street before,different model,it was much better.I noticed also the model just recieved is not the same as I thought I purchsed.The joining edges are much more narrow compared to the case shown."
4,"Good case, good price","I bought it to carry my camera on trips with me. Mostly I have used it to store items I'm not carrying around with me for the day's shooting. I have Cannon XTI. It will hold my camera and my favorite lenses, and their hoods securely. You have to cut the foam to fit your individual lenses and equipment which is kinda a trial and error thing honestly. Cut it, fit it, cut again. The foam smells funny and not in a good way. I hope that will fade. The case is solid, but not too heavy."
1,WRONG CASE SENT...,"I ordered the Opteka X-Large Pro Aluminum Hard Case because of the good reviews I read and was sent another case that I couldn't find any reviews on. ""...our shipping department made a mistake and we will take care of the exchange ASAP."" I never received the case I ordered so I have no information on the quality of this case. I EVENTUALLY... received a refund for the returned case and reimbursed the postage fee for the return."
1,Piece of Crap,"I bought two of these cases, and they are crap. They're poorly made, and they fall apart. The whole front of one of the cases came off while I was unloading my truck and nearly cost me over $8,000 of camera equipment. Thankfully, I eased the fall of the rest of it with my leg and foot. I didn't have them for a month before they broke....DO NOT BUY!"
2,Cheap...but works. So far.,"I was very encouraged when I read the reviews of others...however, mine has not turned out to be 100% amazing. First off, I got a DIGICOM case instead of Opteka. The locks are a joke (I.e, I couldn't get them to lock, and the keys feel like they are made out of tin). The border around the case feels like it will come off in a month or two. The hinges feel cheap; after just a week of use, when I would close the case, the top would be a few hairs off of dead center - enough so that I have to nudge it over to get it to close.But when it comes to protection, it does it's job. I've had it for just under a month; and I wouldn't recommend it for an everyday use case, as it will break down rather quick. But if you need to travel with it, and don't want a camera bag up in the overhead airplane bins, this wil probably work."
1,Bait and Switch,Although this is what I ordered...I was sent a cheap imitation. Good Luck getting the right one! Order at your own risk!
3,Good But....,this is a nice case seems strong i like the size of the cubed foam nice for customizing i found that i ran out of room really fast if you need a rugged awesome case go with pelican cases
3,Not the Best if You Have a Smoker,"This books is worth having, but I was disappointed in that it doesn't 'exclusively' deal with smoking food in a real smoker, which was what I wanted. For those who smoke food on a grill, it probably will meet your needs, however. Since my smoker only goes up to 250 degrees, I will have to make some alterations to the recipes to meet my needs. Buy it used and you probably will be satisfied if you smoke food on a bbq grill."
5,Back to Real Country,"I really enjoy this collection of classic,traditionalcountry songs featuring the fine storytelling of songwriterBrenda Heffernan and the powerful,soulful voice of Jay Sattiewhite.They make quite a team,supported by the clever arrangements and production work of Michael Martin.The songs - honest and heartfelt but never syrupy- deal with themes popular in country music - rodeos,cowboys, young romantic love, lusty one-night stands, married couples struggling economically, victims of alcoholic parents, and mature love.""My In-Laws Are Outlaws"" puts a humorous spin on relatives.Take this ""country"" with you on the road and you will always feel right at home!"
3,A hoot,"Well, perhaps I'm made of titanium, but this book didn't affect me in any way other than to have a good read and a couple of laughs. After you have been downsized (which I have) it's a hoot to imagine what lengths a person would go to to get a job. What I found so clever about Westlake's plot is that the guy doesn't want to kill the people who fired him, the kneejerk reaction, but, rather, his competition for ensuing jobs! In fact, I bought a copy of this book for my former boss who, like me and the rest of our department, was escorted to the door by the HR dept. of our former company. We both liked it but, no, neither of us planned to use it as a primer."
3,First Time Reading Westlake,"I have mixed feeling about this book. It drew my attention in the same way as watching an ""autopsy"" special on television. I was discusted yet I continued reading. I give it a low score for several reasons. First, murder after murder in the same fashion becomes too repetitive. Second, the murders were way to easy to pull off. And third, the ending of the book was pathetic."
4,"Very topical, esp. when read in today's millieu",I thought this was a very enjoyable read. It's supposed to be black humor and the author did it brilliantly.The ending totally adds to the satirical bent of the novel.Loved it!
3,A Future World Of Competition,I saw this movie by Costa Gavras a couple of years ago at the TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL. The movie moved me so much...that I decided to buy the book a year later. I loved reading it but it was so much like the movie that I knew what was going to happen...I probably should have read the book before the movie...I don't know. The MOVIE is simply excellent. I couldn't help seeing excerpts from the film as I read the book. It's a scary dark noir thriller of what could happen with outsourcing jobs to other countries and how one's home country could falter for it...very interesting reading.
2,Well Written but Disgusting,"I actually read this book. Now that I'm done, I really don't want to admit that, but the writing was too good to put it down, even though I grew to thoroughly hate the lead character. I kept hoping something bad would happen to him. I kept thinking up the possible endings that could cause this book to justify itself. The actual ending was the only one I never thought of. And the only one I can't condone."
4,Dark an realistic thriller with great ending.,"Interesting, disturbing and realistic book, about a man downsized out of his job who winds up doing some disturbing things in order to find the job of his dreams. I really got hooked onto this book, from it's first person point of view, the detail that he goes through not only to commit his acts but to conceal them. I also like the fact that the narrator wasn't a total monster. He's written as a man normal man who only has this alternative. He also makes you actually have some empathy for the narrator, which makes this book all the more disturbing. I found myself actually wanting him to get the job. And the ending was the best, I really didn't suspect it would end in such a dark way but I still loved it. Recommended but not for the recently axed"
1,"Empty novel, hanging on a gimmick","Donald Westlake has always been one of my favorites, but this book is absolute garbage. Missing are all of the hallmarks of his standouts -- wit, narrative tension, and an affection for the flawed protagonist. This novel is supposed to be a topical twist on the tired notion that in American society, the end has come to justify the means. All Westlake does with it is invest an angry Babbitt with homicidal rage, have him repeat the same modus operandi over and over again, then cheapen this flaccid plot even further with an ending so contrived that it insults the intelligent reader. The social problem Westlake hopes to address acquires no resonance because his writing is so disaffected and his characterization of our dilemma so offensively simpleminded. THE AX appears to be an earnest literary experiment gone badly wrong. Don't bother with it."
1,Book Club Book,The book was boring and filled with pages of descriptions that filled up space. I would not any other books by this author.
1,Too intense,"I didn't like this book. I thought it was going to have a more interesting storyline but nope, it didn't."
2,What the...?,"Okay people... There's a part about two thirds into this book where the protagonist calls his college age son, ""My darling, my sweetheart, my love..."" and it's not to be humorous, it's a sentimental moment. Does that seem quite normal to anyone? Or does it seem completely ridiculous? And although the first hundred pages were fantastic, the story lost me after two hundred."
5,"Histerical. Engaging. And, yikes, plausible!","Westlake creates characters so well that I feel as if they're friends. When discussing the book with others, I talk about them like they're friends. In The Axe, Westlake spins a tale that is frighteningly realistic in today's competitive world. I work in a very cut throat industry and believe me, this could happen."
1,Disturbing Westlake,"I love Westlake books. I collect Westlake books. I've even flown to NYC to get the chance to meet Donald E. Westlake. (And it was worth every penny too.) But The Ax really disturbed me. The storyline is creepy. I felt uneasy reading it. For all the enjoyment and laughter Mr. Westlake's writings have provided me, (and if I had a dollar for every timed I've laughed out loud at Dortmunder the cost of the plane trip to NYC would be more than reimbursed --I'm not exaggerating), I cannot recommend this book. Instead I'll say: Buy ALL the Dortmunders. Buy ALL the Parkers (Westlake as Richard Stark.) Hunt down the books by a writer named Tucker Coe (another Westlake pseudonym.) And by all means read Mr. Westlake's Trust Me On This which is as funny a novel as I've ever read. All of these other titles are true gems written by a true master."
2,A really disturbing book.,"I read this book from cover to cover and when I was done I wished I hadn't. I can't ever remember reading a book that left me feeling so upset. I guess I am swimming against the tide of ""great read"", ""wonderful book"", ""dark comedy"", etc., but I can't relate to such desperation as ""the assassin"" had. That's just what he was, an assassin. I hope there will be better books in the future from Mr. Westlake."
4,excellent thriller with deeper insights,"The title is clever in its double meaning and the events are unpredictable, frightening and almost believable. I believe Westlake shows the effects of prolonged unemployment on a man's self-esteem, emotional stability, and family relationships. It is a page-turner with no unnecessary descriptions or psychobabble."
5,This book was a hoot. I finished it in 2 sittings!,I found myself rooting for this unlikely hero/loser to get away with his outrageous murder plot. Totally original and fun.
2,Slow read from start to end...,"I was excited to read this book based on a recommendation. However, the pace of the book was just too slow for me to really enjoy it. The plot is plausible, but once again, the story progresses just way too slooooow."
4,A Lagging Indicator of the American Zeitgeist,"Burke Devore is the Willy Loman of the new economy -- with a few critical distinctions that reveal as much about our times as they do about the two protagonists. Where Willy aspires to be ""well-liked,"" Burke just wants a damn job. Where Willy dresses up his son's accomplishments, Burke destroys evidence of his son's larceny. And where Willy's sense of failure leads him to kill himself, Burke's leads him to murder others.This book is chilly in its moral ambiguity. But -- offering further proof of our accelerating cultural cycle times -- the novel seems slightly, just slightly, out of date now that the economy has strengthened. An otherwise excellent piece of writing, The Ax misses the Zeitgeist bullseye by about fourteen months."
4,No more Mr. Nice Guy,"Westlake echoes an earlier Herman Kahn's ""thinking the unthinkable"". This gristly chiller has a middle aged, middle management victim of corporate downsizing decide to ignore the rational norms of civilized society to resolve his dilemma. Burke Devore (devour?) methodically eliminates his perceived job competition by murdering each possible candiate for the job he wants. Devore, who has led the most conventional of standard American life, is completely frustrated in his attempts to continue that life through fair play. From a frightening analysis he comes to realize that only a brutal rejection of the accepted ethic will restore a semblance of what he has lost. This story is a jarring read, and unpleasantly suggests that even in peace we can be victims as much as we could be in war, when individuals are sacrificed in the determination to win at all costs. Devore's actions are an extension of modern corporate will."
3,Escapes are okay,"But in retrospect, they all seem to choose the same escape, a tunnel, which becomes boring."
3,"""Bushmasters"" a good read for WWII history buffs",This is an excellent accounting of a little known military unit's involvement in the war in the Pacific. It is well written and a very readable historical account of action on some of the lesser known islands in the Pacific. I was made aware of this book by my eighty six year old neighbor who fought with the Bushmasters and is mentioned in the tale.
5,Loved this!,"I wish this was a book. There is love, betrayal, fantasy, loyalty, death, a quest, and a mystery. All in this series. I had to get all of the volumes and watched it several times. I think this story was somewhat based on a Japanese folk tale about an angel that was ""captured"" and forced to stay on earth. This story takes place in modern Japan, but the roots begin in old Japan. The English dubbing was very well done. The voices used for the characters are well suited for their personalities--Tommy Campbell--wow!If you'd like to see a part of the dvd before buying, check it out on YouTube. The music from the dvd is also beautiful."
4,Nice little necklace,"I bought this for my two-year-old daughter because it was pretty enough to make her feel special and inexpensive enough that I wouldn't have a heart attack if she lost or broke it. For those purposes, it's very good -- tiny, but so is she. ;-) I got it on sale, so it was a pretty good value -- just don't expect sparkling, huge, clear diamonds."
3,OK pendand - for a little girl,"I bought 4 of these to give to my nieces as christmas presents and I will probably only be able to give 2 maybe 3 of them to the kids. The chain is really small, and I don't think that it will be large enough for my 10 year old niece (who is the oldest). For the younger ones, I think that they will like it because it does have real diamonds. [...]"
3,"Miranda's best solo effort, poor ""remastered"" sound.","Great mid 70's work by Ismael Miranda with a killer studio band. This is essential listening for those into real salsa. The MAJOR letdown is the remastering. As of late, Emusica, the new keepers of the amazing Fania records catalog seem to be carelessly reissuing this material. I could guarantee you that this reissue has been ripped from a record. The sound is a bit flat and there are even places were one could hear the needle skip. This is not the master tape. I happen to own this on the original LP and it sounds way better.I must give credit for the insightful and informative essay and the cool packaging, but Emusica guys, if you are reading this, please let the consumer or collector know if these recordings are taken from a master tape or an LP.If all this technical stuff doesn't bother you then YOU MUST BUY THIS CD!!!!"
3,"fun, even if not completely verifiable","Ok, I can believe that alternative etymologies are out there for some stuff. Credibility is a touchy thing with this topic. That aside, I enjoy this book. As someone else send it is fun to have on the desk and refer to every once in awhile for a random kick.The differing fonts are both cute and distracting.Fun for mad money, as said earlier. I agree."
1,Book has very little credibility,"I was assigned to review this book several years ago for a magazine and was so disappointed with its content that it still annoys me.Some of the etymologies and explanations in the book are probably true, however, there are quite a few instances where Korach and Mordock are demonstrably wrong--enough, I felt, to doubt the credibility of the rest of the book.Read the review from the School Library Journal. See where the reviewer mentions ""disagreements"" with other sources and how difficult it is to pin down etymologies? That's a very delicate way of saying Korach and Mordock's book contains a lot of poorly-researched entries and very dubious explanations.Spend your money on a different etymology book. This one is simply not a reliable source."
2,A hobbyist's speculation about origins,"This is a non-scholarly, non-academic collection of word origins compiled in the 1940s by a lawyer. Many of the expressions are out of date (""go to the dickens,"" ""catch a tarter""). Explanations for many of the origins are simply speculative, with dubious support. Probably the greatest value for this book is as material for small talk or trivia questions. Save your money and check it out from a library."
2,Common Phrases and Where They Come From,"I was very disappointed in this book. Most of the phrases he choose to research were either uninteresting and obvious, or so obscure, I didn't really care about their origins."
3,It's OK,"It's alright if you're looking up Very Familiar Phrases, but the more obscure Phrases are harder to find, or not at all."
2,I'm not impressed,"I'm not impressed with this book.Sarah Plain and Tall is a near perfect novel in it's simplicity and depth but it is evident that MacLachlan spent neither the time nor the care to develop this story. I felt jipped with the cliches and predictable unfolding. This is definitely not her best writing.Plus, the way the father Jacob is portrayed (an angry unforgiving man) takes away from his character in the first book .. shy, strong, deep and wise.This book is a classic example of an author monopolizing on something good (Sarah Plain and Tall) knowing her fans will buy it. In the book ""Caleb's Story"" MacLachlan leaves herself plenty of loopholes so we know there will be more books.I'm disappointed and kinda disgusted."
3,Caleb's Story,The book was great but the delivery was aweful. I paid extra money to have speedy delivery. I was supposed to get the book within 2 business days. However it took more than a week to get the book after the seller send me the email confirming shipping. Will not buy from things seller again.
1,Looks good...,"on the outside and when you browse through it looks to be pretty concise, the problem lies in the fact the book and cd don't match, I've seen other reviews that say they received no .fla files I have the .fla files but the work files are actually the same as the finished files except for the small fact that they don't work (code is exactly the same from what I can tell actionscripting wise but the examples never work and I spend more time deciphering the mistakes to double check my work than I do learning the ideas. Maybe they should have made this a bug testing book at least you would have a chance to learn something."
1,Rip off,I was disappointed to find that the .fla files that the book says the disk contains were not actually there! I want my duckets back.
2,I could't see the point of the book,"i had tryied this book for about 2 weeks, i do agree that a lot of codes are not really working, poorly explain the reason why should we du that, and the code itself is very hard to follow even just trying to copy it from the book to the action window bcoz there is no line indecator there.i am not really sure if this book is for begenner, intermidate, or advance flash user, since some workshop are just as simple as the tutorials that come with the software, but some are very long and hard to understandthis book is not to teach readers how to use the shoftware(or it just fails to teach), and also is not a book of creative idea that will help us out when we run out of idea while designingthat's why i said "" i couldin't really see the point of the book"""
4,4 stars for customer service... 2 stars initially,"I bought this book initially for the panoramic project. Come to find out that the .swf file did not work. Looked on the web site, and at the time, there was no corrected file. I was disappointed because I was going to apply technique to a project at my job.Then...I wrote to newriders and they referred me to Matthew David, author of this book. He has helped me out and files will be uploaded on the newriders site shortly.Whenever you can get a source .fla from 2advanced, which was a nice surprise, definitely worth the price... YES, a tute from 2advanced."
1,Bad investment...,"Throughout the years I have read many goob and bad technical books. What I can say about Flash MX Magic is simple, do not purchase this book if you realy want to learn or master Flash. I'm still looking for a book that teaches in an easy and clear way. I have wasted my money on this book.In overall don't fall in the trap by purchasing Macromedia Flash MX Magic."
1,MX magic is not magical,"First I give two huge thumbs up for the two previous books Flash 5 and 4 Magic. I will not say the same for Flash MX Magic. Unfortunately I wasted a weekend trying to understand chapter 14 in this book. The files on the CD and the updates didn't match the files in the book. This book ONLY teaches through example and poorly explains the thought process on why and how things work. The mistakes are so often and so irritating you wonder if the book was ever proofed before publishing. The best metaphore I can come up with is a cook book where the ingredients are mixed and matched from different recipes and you have to guess whether or not you mix, stir or even cook the ingredients to come up with your final product. I lost a weekend of my life to this book. I want my weekend back!"
1,The magic of disappearing acts and files.,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Where's the magic?? I should have read the reviews before I bought this book. Instead I was lured in by the step by step projects, some of which matches what I want to do with my current project. The CD that came with the book doesn't contain any .fla files or project files in the ""projects"" folder. Just useless .swf files. The same damn files are repeated in the sample ""movies"" folder. So as you read the chapter and attempt to follow the instructions to recreate the project, you can't! You don't have any of the files the chapters refer to. You don't have anything to work with except your imagination.I called the publisher and got the run around. Got transferred to five different numbers each with their own automated menu or message. Shame on you New Riders/Pearson Education. Never again will I buy another New Riders book!!!"
5,"Simplified, Advanced, Well Designed and Written","I just received my Flash MX book about 3 days ago and what a find it is. The book itself is well designed with plenty of pictures in full color to follow along with, and easy to read directions and explanations.This book would be great for any user as many of the applications within the book are real world examples of things most of us would actually use! A rare thing to find.You need two books, your big fat flash book with everything in it, and you need Flash MX Magic. You name it, Audio, Programming a Game, Preloading, A great scroll bar routine (Ch 4) which anyone can use for many different types of applications, and a great chapter on Dynamic Database work in Ch 14.Two Thumbs Up!"
4,Magic with Flash,"FLASH MX MAGICMatthew DavidPUBLISHER: New RidersREVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: Flash MX Magic' is divided into four sections that discuss Fundamentals, Scripting Tools, Site Management and Advanced uses. Each chapter begins with ""It Works Like This"" which will prepare you for what is in the chapter. At the end of each chapter is a Summary and ""How To Improve"" which will give your creative juices a nudge in other directions.It would be a good idea to have the basics of Flash down before reading this book. If you already know ActionScript, then Flash MX Magic will present a vastly more challenging version of ActionScript that comes close to JavaScript. A CD is included to help you through the exercises.Step-by-step instructions and clear writing will give you the necessary tools to use Flash MX Magic to the best possible advantage. By working the exercises and using your own thinking ability, you can come up with new and different uses for Flash!"
5,"As always, a great asset for developers",I can bearly keep up with Flash! This book is a great addition to the Flash Magic Series.
1,Another waste of time and money,"I've been developing sites for over 5 years now. I don't know if that makes me an expert, as there is always something to learn, but I know a good book when I see and use one, and this is not it.When I am given a project to follow along with, I need clear instructions that make sense. This book doesn't have them.When I am given code to dissect, I need to make sure it works before hand. This book doesn't have it.When I am given ""final"" examples, they should work. Heck, the example animations even play backwards in this book.Don't waste your money. New Riders should be ashamed of putting this garbage on the market."
2,"Great ideas, terrible code","I have been designing Web sites for years, and was a Network Engineer for years before that. This book is well written and talks about great examples, but it doesn't work. I know Flash. I know a bit about Flash Action Scripting, but I have not been able to get one single script to work correctly. You shouldn't have to read a second book just to get the one you bought to work right. Like someone else said, even the finished examples don't work right, so you can't look at that code to see what's wrong.I expect much more than that from any book, and I would return this book if I still could. I spent too much time thinking I was doing something wrong to be able to return it now, though.In summary, buy another book. You will probably be happier."
2,Errors in codes,"The book looks good but can be frustrated to work with. I bought it last week and was working up to chapter 3 when I realized that the ActionScript codes supplied from the book did not work at all. I've had good experirence with New Riders with great books such as 'Flash Web Design, The Art of Motion Graphic' by Hillman Curtis. But this time, I'm very disappointed with this Flash MX Magic. ..."
2,hard to understand,I had trouble with this book. The instructions were hard to understand and the examples didn't start from the beginning. The action script was already done for you and there were bugs in some of them. Not for beginners! If you have none or even little knowledge of flash forget about his book. It's not for you!
1,flash mx magic,The CD that comes with the book did not have the supporting files for the lessons. Opps!
5,"Not a kid, just don't have my own Amazon account.","When I first got this album, I wasn't sure what to expect.. I'd listened to Beast of Blood and Gardenia, and also merveilles (although that's not from the Klaha era). And I was.. Well, only word I could think of was ""..Wow"".If you're expecting another merveilles, you'll be let down in that aspect, but quite honestly Bara no Seidou is quite a bit better than it. This album is a lot darker, and not near quite as poppy as merveilles.There are really no stand-out songs on this album for me, they are all equally fantastic and Bara no Seidou is best listened to all the way through. This album kind of reminds me of a sort of dark cathedral music.Over-all, if you've listened to anything by Malice Mizer and enjoyed it, you need to buy this album. It is their best stuff I've heard."
5,"Wonderful, Heartwarming movie",The Song of Norway is one of my favorite movies. The music is beautiful and the performances are outstanding. Angelic Florence Henderson makes a lovely Nina Grieg!
3,"Beautiful music and scenery, cheesy '70's production","I love the music, the scenery is breathtaking, I adore Florence, and Edward G. Robinson is always fun. However, the titles, the sudden camera zooms, and some really awful choreograhy all glaringly point to the period in which the movie was made. Watch and enjoy, but be ready to flinch. I've got a bad VHS copy, but when is this finally going to be put on DVD?"
3,Memory from Childhood,"I remembered this movie from my childhood and I remember that I liked it very much. Although the scenery was gorgeous, it is definately a movie for kids. It's a sad knock-off of The Sound of Music. I still enjoyed viewing it but wish I didn't have to buy it to see it."
1,Owww -- too much sugar for my metabolism,"Okay, it's not a cultural thing (I'm half Norwegian). Maybe it's just that I keep expecting the rest of the Brady Bunch to come streaming into the scene (they'd be right at home). Tho' I have to admit that Florence Henderson is a real cutie in this movie. But the acting seemed too wooden and the cinematography was too heavy handed for my taste (eye popping scenery heavily synched to the music)."
1,Still getting Spammed,"I purchased this software hoping to eliminate the sexually oriented pop-ups that I keep seeing on my desktop PC. After I installed it, it did nothing but slow up my log-in. I didn't understand the activation process; it appeared that it was asking me to subscribe to a monthly service in order to stop the pop-ups (which confused me because that's what I though this software was for. The pop-ups keep coming.I e-mailed for support (not 24/7 for calls) and was requested to send them a diagnostic report following their instructions and using a utility that was included. I did that and sent it back to them, and I'm still waiting to hear back.Surely there must be a better deal than this out there."
1,Never worked,I never got this program to work. I have emailed Safeworld twice in four weeks and have not received any type a response. What a waste of $30!!!!
1,This Software is bad news,"Every since I loaded this program I have had problem,the pop-up part never did work. I cannot shut down my computer unless I activate Windows Task Master and end the Safeworld problem,I have tried every thing to unstall the program, after I got it off my desktop I unstalled it from add/remove(control panel)and it still restrick my shutdown,it's still in Task Master,and every 3 minutes I get an error message from it. I e-mailed their customer service, I got one answer back saying someone would get intouch with me, they never did and now my e-mail to them just comes back. All I want now is help getting it off my computer.Thanks."
2,Broke,"I bought this to replace the original scraper on my snow thrower. The original lasted two seasons with this driveway. On the second usage this scraper cracked and about a third of it broke off.I do not know of any alternatives, but am not happy with this one."
3,good basic manual,"Manual is good for an overview, but only a small portion of the book will actually apply to your engine. You wont get a lot of detail for repairs, but has some good maintenance tips in it."
3,force outboard shop manaul,"manual helps but very confusing at locating what we are looking for,when you think you have what you are looking for its not a match dose not have info on if the parts can be changed out with diffrent year but same motor, electical wireing does not help if one of you is color blind, pictures were you think you may be able to compare are to dark. personaly I don't like the way the so called index is it is very confusing"
2,Funny,"I purchased this CD but thought the person on the cover was actually Neil Diamond as I did not have good graphics on my old computer! So when this arrived I laughed as it is a look-alike! But we all got a good laugh and he actually does a good job. The CDG has 2 versions, 1 with the dude on the cover singing and one where you can sing on your own. I would say it was not worth the price I paid, $19.95 but, oh well."
2,not for me,This book may be good for tose inclined towards Wesley or Methodism but it is not my cup of tea.
3,Good set of knives to abuse....,"Look...you get what you pay for. These knives are made to use and abuse...then throw away. You use these knives for box opening, prying things loose, and just cutting things along concrete. If your expectations for this set aren't too high...you wont be dissapointed."
4,good product,"i gave 4 stars only because it's not as powerful as the other brand i've tried before, and I like capsules better than tablets. overall it's a good product, i've been taking it for low milk supply along with goat's rue and blessed thistle."
4,"Dog loves it, but easy to destroy","My dog loves this thing, she takes it everywhere with her. The only problem is, it didn't take her long to tear through it and get the stuffing and squeeker out. She still plays with the deflated one, and it works fine for tug of war"
2,It's a matter of taste,"One of my favorite composer is Bartók. I like old recordings and I bought this CD in expectation of something special. Unfortunately I don't like it. The first movement of the piano concerto maybe OK but the second and third are not for my taste. Mr. Sándor slows down when I would like faster tempos and speeds up when I expected slower tempos. The melodies are strange, he skips some beautiful moments. The Concerto less wrong but nothing special. Tempos are rather slow but in this case it is boring not beautiful. The last movement is fresh but nothing more. So I don't like this CD but I think it is a matter of taste.The transfer is acceptable considering its age but dynamics are extremely compressed. It is great that hiss almost completely filtered without too much influence to the sonority."
1,BEWARE: Don't Buy This From Amazon,Amazon will tell you that this product ships in 3 to 5 weeks -- don't believe it!!! We ordered 6 cases on in early Feb. 4 cases arrived in 3 weeks -- but we're still waiting on the other 2! That's 9 weeks folks! I could have grown the soybeans and canned the stuff myself in 9 weeks. We made the mistake of trying to buy other 6 cases in early March -- and Amazon is now estimating delivery in JUNE! That's 12 weeks!!!It's a crime Amazon still sells this product to unsuspecting customers.
3,Better Delivery,"We only waited one week for 2 cases.The cans were not in the best shape, though. The cases got pretty beat up in shipment. Many cans were dented, but none were leaking or unuseable. Best price on-line that I have found. Right on track with the best price I have found in discount stores with tax. I would order again knowing that it will be one week or more."
4,The Kennedys Season 1 interesting,"I was not around when these Kennedy's were around, so seeing some of how things were was interesting. I did not know quite how much the sons were prepped for their political career. It was enlightening to see."
5,Five stars for this movie,I really liked this movie! It was probably the best of all the Kennedy sagas I have seen. Katie Holmes was outstanding as Jackie.
3,Just Okay Movies,"A $5.00 dollar collection is right, since this is what I paid for at Walmart. A lot of low quality horror on most movies listed. Some viewed as a vhs tape transfer. Some gory one's such as, ""The Greenkeeper"", and ""The Dead of Night"", are your usual teen horror flicks. There are some scary creatures in some of the movies. These movies are violent, gory, funny, scary, some more than others.Some familiar movies are included such as, ""The Prophecy II"", ""Dracula III: Legacy"", and ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"". I wouldn't pay more than you have to for this set. For twenty movies, $5.00 is a bargain at 25 cents a movie."
2,impossible to assemble correctly,"Sheets of cardboard do not slide in easily and align poorly. I have it together, but not properly because cardboard was bending. not goo"
2,Based on Duncan's earlier efforts...,"His weakest to date, no question. I've listened to it over and over and I've tried to like it but in all honesty these are all sub-par songs at best. I loved the debut and ""Humming"" is still one of my favorite albums of all time. I loved the pop' aspect of ""Daylight"" but try as I might I don't like this album. If you are new to Duncan then you may like this album. However, if you are a fan of ""Humming"" this album will be a real disappointment. It's too bad as I thought Duncan would be able to tackle our political atmosphere in the US and write beautiful tracks. Alas Duncan should stick to love songs and deep thoughts. Leave the politics to someone else."
3,Soothing.......,"As is typical with Duncan Sheik, you are going to get a relaxing ride with this album. Mr Sheik has a lot of powerful things to say this time up, with political satires and of course, difficulty in love but you have to be in the mood for it. My recommendation, not for long drives in the car!!"
2,Yawn,"I mean no disrespect, but why do I feel like everytime Ilisten to a new Duncan Sheik record, I'm either going toa funeral or coming away from someone's wake. And eventhough the music is melodically interesting, the lyricstake too long to get into. I feel I cannot to what he'ssinging about."
4,His best since Humming.....,This is the Duncan Sheik I've been waiting for since the 1998 album Humming. There's nothing wrong with his more pop oriented work but personally I prefer music that's a little more introspective and even intense. White limousine is his most in depth album in my opinion since Humming and that's a good thing believe me because Duncan has the ability to be right up there on the list with people like John Lennon. It is my perspective.Highlights include hey casanova and white limousine...yes we won the war....indeed.
1,A Senseless Method,"The so-called ""Grape Cure""was popularized about 70 years ago by the author who claimed that she cured herself of what she assumed was cancer through fasting and eating nothing but grapes. (She did not have a bopsy, so it is impossible to be certain of her diagnosis.) There is no scientific evidence that the diet has any value. Even worse, the diet it advises is deficient in several important nutrients and can cause constipation, diarrhea, cramps, and weight loss -- all of which are undesirable for cancer patients. This is a book worth ignoring.Stephen Barrett, M.D.Quackwatch.com"
5,Nature's cancer cure....,I absolutely loved and believed this woman. I tried the grape cure just as a cleansing and it blew me away. I have never felt healthier. People are too much into traditional medicine. I really believe that this diet could cure cancer. What happened to me was astounding. It totally cleaned my intestines and colon.
3,Bollywood Tarzan,"Well, I was entertained for over 2 hours by this amazing amount of nonsense. Probably set in northern India (there are lions as well as tigers, Indian elephants, and large rubber crocodiles and anaconda-like snakes). Tarzan looks the part but Jane, I mean Ruby, wanders through the jungle in high-heeled boots and flimsy, often soaked transparent dresses... not that there's anything wrong with that. The typical Bollywood song and dance routines break out right on schedule and the budget makes a Troma film look high-class. I wish Tarzan had been a bit more macho, but overall this was a pleasantly jaw-dropping way to spend a rainy afternoon."
5,The Crow's Magick Tarot Deck,"This deck has beautiful color and metallic imagery that captures your eye against the black card back. It is a great deck to look at and use after learning from white card backs. It feels like a new level of tarot reading. Truly capturing the magic of the crow and incorporating other animal magics as well. I use about 8 different decks, and this one is my favorite for evening readings."
2,Disappointed in Crowe's Tarot,"I have been looking for a tarot deck with birds, ravens or crows in particular as Ravens are familars for me and I have had a family of them at my home for years.In purchasing this deck the picture on the cover and the internet's assessment of ""beautiful cards"" made me choose this deck. The deck itself was commissioned by a person with ""shaman"" tendancies which would be good for anyone with native american blood or connections.Upon arrival and looking and ""feeling"" the deck, it severely lacks ""cohesiveness"" with me. The cards are more abstract where the artist attempts to impress with visual images rather than real life bird images. The deck is for someone wanting ""entertainment"" at parties NOT a deck for someone who connects with the true spirit of the tarot."
2,Save your money!,"I am so mad at myself for buying this! The commercial is very misleading. It makes you think the toy does and has a lot more with it than it does. It is made with flimsy plastic and is not easy to get it to stay on the shower wall. The paint on it was poor at best. It took nearly an hour to get it out of the box because of the wires, tape, etc. I only gave this item a 3 on the educational value because my daughter is autistic and has a terrible fear of bubbles and sitting down in the tub. It has helped us there. If it wasn't for that, this toy would be returned so fast! For all you other parents, though, I strongly advise not buying this toy. (Unless it gets marked down to a dollar!)"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,I also purchased the item for my daughter because of thecommercial. This toy does nothing and my daughter playedwith the toy for a total of 5 mins and lost intrest.The only itme she liked was the whale because the watershoots out the top.
2,Not what you expect,"Unfortunately, if you're looking for the same creative juice Dolinsky poured into some of the old ""Outer Limits"" episodes, you're going to be disappointed. This book is boring and very predictable, except for the ending where Dolinsky completely gives up trying to get out of the corner he wrote himself into.Such a shame."
3,Better for camp cooks with some experience.,"The introductory material on buying, seasoning and cleaning the oven is excellent. The suggested additional equipment is reasonable and easily obtainable. The lack of temperature information and baking times of the individual recipes is a serious shortcoming to beginning dutch oven cooks as is the lack of information on the amount of coals necessary to produce a specific temperatures. Overall, an excellent cook book, but better for more experienced cooks."
3,okay book,Bought this book hoping to get a little more info on dutch oven cooking. I agree with the others it needs a coal breakdown for temps. Some recipes gave temps so if you know the breakdown your okay.Most of the recipes and coal breakdowns can be found on the internet anyhow.

5,women ministry handbook!,"I was the women ministry leader of my church back in 2000. Trying to find out ways to improve the existing ministry at that time; I ran into this resource book. The book was well organized and provided much information to lead a women ministry in any size. I still read it every once in a while. If you are priviledged to lead a women ministry, this book is a prayer-answered."
5,Excellent Introduction,"This is a very solid introduction to Aristotle and very thought-provoking as well. It is very lucid, well-organized, and one of the best in the Introducing series."
5,it works,this is easy to use and it works quickly. it is not a nail polish. it is a liquid you paint on twice a week.You dont need much so the little bottle lasted me over 6 months. one dip in the bottle for 5 fingers is ample.I put it on at bedtime so it doesnt get washed off .It makes your nails harder and healthier almost immediately. It is a good product and worth using.
4,Very good since the first time you use it.,"I've just started using this product. My nails tips are still aplitting, but I can feel it's on the right track. I recommend it."
1,Deceptive picture,The magazine rack pictures a picture on the front. The front and back is plain off-white material. One of the dowels was so badly warped it could not be used. I wrote the manufactor and then gave me a credit immediately.
3,"Good, but loses air every few days","The pillow is good, especially for people like me who suffer from upper shoulder & neck pain. The pillow is an air pillow - something that is not obvious from the product description. But it is good none the less.I recommend using a cotton pillow case to slide this under, and to fill the pillow about 3/4th way (its too firm if you fill it completely).The one reason I did not give this a higher rating is because the pillow loses air every other day. I returned one unit back to Amazon thinking it is defective, but the replacement I received had the same problem.I prefer this pillow over most other neck rolls because you can fill up air and make it as firm as you want. The other pillows I tried were either too firm or too soft, and I did not like it as much. I'd recommend this pillow if you don't mind filling up air every other day."
3,"Good quality, but not comfortable to sleep on","I've used a good dozen neck/snore/cervical pillows over the years, because of chronic upper-back issues. I've been looking for a new one recently and figured I'd give this one a try because it was inexpensive. I wasn't able to fall asleep while using it."
2,"Plastic, noisy, slippery","I found this to be unusable for me. It is too slippery (even in a pillow case), too noisy and feels uncomfortable and smelly plastic. I will stick to a softer material. I do not recommend this. You get what you pay for."
4,Mckenzie neck roll,Very good support for my neck for sleeping at night. Fits easily into the pillow case with the pillow. Gives me just the right amount of support to keep from having those painful morning and all day neck pains.
2,Leaks every time you use it,It would be comfortable if it wasn't leaking. I only fill it 3/4 full per the directions but it is half full by morning.
1,Caused more pain,"I read great reviews about this item and was looking forward to trying it. I have a lot of pain in my neck and shoulders and my old pillow was shot. Unfortunately, it caused me more pain. The pain it caused was at the base of my skull - something I had not experienced before. I was very disappointed!"
3,Comfortable if you don't switch between back and side sleeping,"This air neck pillow provides adequate support for your neck, but it can be uncomfortable if you switch from your side to your back or vice versa. That's because you need less volume under your neck when sleeping on your back than on your side. This pillow is cylindrical, providing the same volume for either position.However, if you don't switch positions, it might work for you. Also, it is lightweight and collapses, so it would be convenient for travel.PROS:- Reasonably priced- Works if you sleep only on your back or only on your sides- Lightweight and collapses for travelCONS:- Doesn't work if you switch from side to back or vice versa"
3,Not very comfy,"I had a hard time getting the right amount of air in this. First it was too hard, then too soft. Once I finally got it adjusted to the right firmness, it kept slipping every time I moved. I ended up rolling up a towel, it worked better."
3,I didn't realize this was air-filled blow up pillow so I returned it.,"The photo looks very similar to many other cervical pillows listed on Amazon that are foam or fiber filled, so when I ordered this product with this price I thought, what a steal! Turns out it is actually a blow up air pillow. ""Medic-Air""... I should've paid more attention to the title but I just assumed that the ""air"" was in the product name for an uplifting/pain relieving effect the pillow might have on people with neck problems. I guess I read too much into it: PAnyway, this would have been great if I were looking for a neck pillow to travel with, but it did not suit my needs so I had to return it."
1,"Painful, Dated and Inaccurate","I am an enormous fan of Japan, widely interested in it's politics, economy and culture. Perhaps that is why this book disappoints me so much. The text is hard to read - much more appropriate for an academic journal than a general text. (There are 40+ footnotes in each chapter, making it seem like a list of quotations rather than anything real) This would be forgivable if the conclusions were either clear or accurate. (Example: The comment that Japan is on the verge of inflation. I'm sure most policy makers in Japan wishes this were true, but it's been stuck in a quagmire of deflation for quite some time) Lastly, the book just is not timely. For a work with 1st and 2nd editions in 2000 and 2003, most of the references are from the 1970s and mid 1980s. There has been a lot of post-bubble scholarship that is missed.I am wholly dissatisfied with this book."
3,Beautiful!,"This is a beautiful book with spectacular photography. I was disappointed, however, in the lack of historical background and descriptions. The other issue: the type is TINY. I bought this for my mother and she needs a magnifying glass to read the copy! It appears to be set in a 7- or 8- point font, which is virtually unreadable."
3,"Awesome Pictures, Poor Binding","Ordered this as a gift for a family member, and while the pictures are wonderful and it would make a great coffee table book, I can't help but feel the one I received was well on its way to falling apart. The binding was already broken in some places. Looks like most people had better luck than I did though, so it may have been a fluke."
3,NOT SO SPECTACULAR,Selected this book for my Sister and Brother in law who are making there first trip to Ireland.......the pictures are wonderful but the descriptions are very long winded and does not hold your interest..........I was disappointed but they seemed to be happy with it....
4,Nice book,"The photography in this book is good and worth the money as a general introduction to Ireland.If you are a photography fan and it is great images of Ireland you are after then I would highly recommend a great Irish photographer, Sean Monaghan as he explores the Irish landscape and food characters in his book 'A Taste of Cork'. Also available from AmazonA Taste of Cork: A Gourmand's Tour of Its Food and Landscape"
3,I want to buy an English version.,This book is translated into Chinese in Taiwan. I want to buy an English version. Please infrom me when the publisher has stock.Thanks
3,Series listing error,"pywrit.com gives Harlequin Superromance No. 236 as Carla Neggers, Winning Battle. That is an error. The Neggers book was a Harlequin Temptation. No. 236 is the correct listing for Pamela Bauer, Halfway to Heaven."
3,Fun but shameless comercisalism really!,"We all loved the groundbreaking show right? That's why we are here and thinking about buying/playing the game, alongside the fact that we really miss Carrie and the gang. Unfortunately it's quite dissapointing, the box is large and glitzy and kind of fools you into believing an interesting board game awaits you; not so, just a few pretty pink cards and some dice. The cards are to be collected based on answering questions about the series but some of the answers are just wrong! (SACK THE RESEARCH ASSISTANT!) Like another reviewer here I have checked out the answers I felt suspicious about by rewatching episodes and I was correct. You would think the manufacturers would have made the effort wouldn't you?A shame this doesn't do fans nor the series justice, not unlike the album of the series I have also reviewed. Not worth the investment really, unless you buy it never to open it as an antique of the future."
2,I love SATC but...,this game is not representative of it at all. Some of the questions are just dumb. They are specific and trivial to the point where you had to remember props. My girlfriends and I just ended up making up our own rules since theirs is not a fun format. And you're really just buying trivia cards in one giant tin box. nicely packaged but really not worth the money. Save it to buy the complete SATC dvds instead.
4,Fun girls night in game,"The SATC Trivia Game is fun, especially if you get a group of watchers together for some cocktails to go w/ the game for a girls' night in. Just like the other reviewers, I have noticed a few mistakes on the games answers. Overall, if you love the show, you will have fun with the game. The rules are a bit confusing at first, but you'll get the hang of it afer trying it out. When I played, we changed the rule instead of acting out the word if you roll a 6, to be more of a Catch Phrase or Taboo type of question where you would give hints to the players as to what the answer was w/o saying the word. Some of those words were just impossible to act out."
2,Disappointing,Purchased this game before a beach trip with friends as we all love board games. It was very disappointing to find out that it doesn't even have a board. The whole concept how to play the game is pretty lame and boring. The questions on the cards are ok but sometimes refer to really obscure situations for the show. We attempted to play the game according to the rules but never got into it. We ended up reading the questions out loud for everyone to guess while preparing meals. I gave it away after we came back from the trip as I knew we would never open the box again.
3,okay but a few mistakes!,my husband bought this for me for christmas. i was so excited to open it and test it out. i've already found 2 answers that are WRONG!! i'm positively sure they're wrong too b/c i went back and watched that certain show. it's okay but it could've been a lot better. sex and the city is still the BEST show EVER!!
4,works as promised,"It works well.My only complaint is that the buttons are so large and sensitive that nothing can touch them. Which means I can't lay down, or lean the side of my head on anything, or even turn 90degress in a high backed chair (car)Audio quality is great. Construction is sound.I use these with my computer and my cellphone. Because of the simplified pairing interface, and the limit of profiles, it can be really tricky (and unstable) to use with two devices. Maybe the right two. But for sure satisfaction, assume that you will only be using this with one device, and not re assigning it very often at all."
4,"Cool, Fun, and Easy",These are cool fun and easy once you understand the buttons. The bottons aren't really labeled but how would you read while they're on your head anyway. Good range with the bluetooth and they sound great in the full stereo mode.I haven't used the call functions. I bought these to use with my computer and home theater when the wife is sleeping and both she and I love these headphones.
2,"Good sound, but very uncomfortable","I should have paid more attention to the reviews. I went ahead and ordered these, mostly due to price - nowhere can you find wireless stereo headphones for $35! There's a reason, though. After wearing them for only 30 minutes, my ears were very sore. No way of adjusting them. Sound is pretty good, but certainly can't overcome the discomfort. Will be returning for credit."
5,Jabra Bluetooth Headset,"I love it, I bought it at an AT&T store when it first came out for almost $140.00, so you can see that its a great price here. It pairs easily and has excellent sound quality (and I'm extremely picky when it comes to quality sound). I want to buy an extra set in case anything ever happens to these. They charge fast and work great. Only problem I ever have is without a case, you can accidently turn them on way to easy and when you need them, the battery is dead. The on button is on the right ear and pushes very easy to turn on the unit expecially when you handle them to just move them. You have to always be sure that the light is not blinking or you'll drain the battery, whose charging connector comes with a standard small USB connector found on most phones and headsets today. It comes with a charger and a black protective cover that a bit too small, so fighting to get it in the bag can cause you to accidently turn it on."
3,Pretty good value for the money,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive Bluetooth stereo headphone to go with my Samsung Juke. This unit has excellent value and the sound is very good. It takes a bit of getting used to the way it works as you need to tap on the sides to start it up and use the telephone. The switches on the cups are a bit small. I like the comfort of the unit.My only concern and this is because of the type of headphone it is, is when you sweat working out the sponges are going to get nasty.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Flash forward to August 2010The headphones suddenly stopped working last week. The charger continues to stay on red but apparently no charge is being stored. I can't start the unit up and it seems to be dead. It may be the constant sweat, as I work out five or more times per week. Next pair needs to be more for workouts and less susceptible to sweat damage. BTW I reduced my rating by one star."
3,Too big,"For 50 bucks was a bit to much... kind of big and for some reason it keep re-starting my phone. But it is ok, good sound and some what practical."
2,Mediocre at best,"Audio Quality is poor, very poor. Even new, It sounded like an old burned out headphone.too much functionality is packed in those huge buttons at the sides, wich are too sensitive and get a lot of fake presses.the side lights are ridiculous"
3,These things are huge!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I used it for about 1 month, yeah it works, nothing wrong with it. But its SOOOOOO HUGE. It looks like im wearing ear muffs in the snow. and some time you accidently press the on button once that thing will keep blinking blue the whole week, it seems to never run out of battery. i charge 1 every like 5 months literaly. Some say thats a good thing. But for some reason i dont like it."
3,"Easy to setup, but not loud enough.","Everything went smoothly with the JABRA BT620s setup, they are comfortable to wear, although I wish it had 2 more clicks up on the volume. I set this up with a moto Q and when I use the voice recognition to call out using this headphone, it sometimes does not shut off the music, it is best to pause before using the voice recognition."
1,GARBAGE!,"I got these as a Christmas present with no gift receipt. I was really excited when I got them. I tried to pair these headphones with my cell phone (Sony Ericsson w580i), worked great.... for the first minute, then all sound was cut off. Even when I turned off the bluetooth and unpaired the headphones from my phone the sound never came back till I restarted my phone. I tried un-pairing and then re-pairing my phone to the headphones about 3-4 times and the same thing happened each time. My husband has the new Blackberry 8830, I had him try to use my headphones, SAME ISSUE OCCURRED, worked for a minute then stopped working all together.If I could return these headphones I would in a heartbeat, these are a complete WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,Volume too low,"I purchased these headphones to listen to audio books on my AT&T Tilt while working around the house. They were cheap, and I figured my usage and expectations were low. The volume, even when cranked up to max, is too low to hear when any other noise is present. I could barely get 15 feet away from the Tilt before the audio cut out entirely. I hadn't planned to actually use these headphones for phone calls, but just for kicks I had my husband call my cell phone while I was listening (well, trying to listen) to music. The headphones correctly answered the call but did not pause the music (phone incompatibility, not headphones fault) but my husband sounded like he was underwater and far away. He said I sounded the same (microphone is in the earpiece!). I'm returning the headphones, as I can use any of my wired headphones and just put the phone in my pocket for my purposes."
2,God awful!,"When I first received these headphones I was anxious to try them out and enjoy the convenience of wireless connectivety. Boy was I disappointed! First off the sound is sooo low, it was almost imperceptible. So naturally I returned them thinking they were defective. Alas when the second pair arrived I was soon to discover they to produce the same low volume level as the first pair. All of the features worked with my Samsung M520 phone including voice-dialing and voice caller ID. I was surprised also to find out the same low volume was output from my phones MP3 player as well> If you are looking for a good LOUD pair of headphones beware of this pair!"
2,Jabra BT620s Bluetooth Headphone - not as good as it seems...,"When I came across this product, which was by accident, I grew excited...thinking, FINALLY. As I read the product information - I thought it was a great idea. So I decided to buy it coupled with the Jabra BT620s Bluetooth Headphone for my brand new ipod. I gave a true run of it, testing it out for a couple of months. My final thought is that I don't think the technology is up with the great idea. I found it very frustrating that my signal was constantly being interrupted, the volume only seems to go to a level '5' on a scale from 0 to 10. AND the adapter doesn't stay in the ipod. I don't think I would recommend this product."
3,good for the money,When I first started using the headphones the music was coming in real staticky. Now after some use it works good. for the money you can't beat it.
4,Works good but to bulky,"I like the performance and sound quality of this headset. Im using it with a jabra a120s adapter. I also used it with a samsung a727 cellphone. Thise headset worked perfectly with both devices.I gave 4 stars because this headset is too bulky and heavy, i wish they were smaller and thinner like the other brands."
4,Great Product for the price!,"I really like this product, I found it had a lot more features that I didn't know were even possible. I am new to the bluetooth world and was really impressed. I like the ability to take calls while the headphones are on. The headphones will automatically pause your music when a call comes in, and the mic is built right in so you can just start talking.I like to keep reviews fairly short, so here are my good points:-awesome deep and full sound-long life between charges-controls for music and volume right on the headset.-awesome range, sometimes I forgot where my phone was and kept on jammin.-cool indicator lights tell you if your battery is good, low are charging(blue, red and green)A few things I disliked.-no lock button, the headphones are easy to turn on with a push of the side buttons that can often get tapped in a backpack.-there is no way to turn off all the blue flashing lights so you will draw some unwanted attention at times."
3,Good idea and design,"I love the idea of not having a cord to tie you down, the only flaws i have found with this is that they're not quite as loud as i would like, and the flashing blue lights are a pain to keep turning off, other then that this is a great pair of headphones with semi-decent sound quality."
4,I paired it with a Sony Ericsson W580i,"The W580i has an attachment for listening to the radio. It can't send the radio sound to the headphones because of this attachment. I'm glad that I bought the Jabra BT 620s and its A120s music adapter, or I still would be listening to the radio through the wires.This combination doesn't work so well when you pair the headphones with the W580i and the adapter. Trying to answer a call was a headache because the phone, the heaphones, and the adapter had all kinds of communication problems.But when I took the radio attachment out and just paired the headphones to the phone, I could listen to MP3s and easily talk on the phone (not simultaneously, of course).These headphones are pretty easy to use."
4,very good for the price,"Good sound quality/price ratio for a stereo Bluetooth headphone. Works about up to 6-8 meters from the source without any problems. Pairing is easy (I am using 32bit vista), but you might need to restart programs(mp3 player,etc..) after pairing with a computer.Depending on your ear shape, it could be disturbing after a while. So you probably won't be able to continuously use this for over ~2-3 hours(it is slightly heavier than normal headphones, as expected). It is good and easy to use with cell phones and other sources as well, but note that many such devices use their own headphone as an FM antenna, so you might be unable to listen to the radio if you use this instead."
3,Not what I needed,I bought this and then found out that it wouldn't work with my phone. I guess I could have looked into the different bluetooth profiles before I bought it.
1,These headphones suck because of the cryptic user interface design,I bought them like an year ago and they are so damn un-usable that I have used them like thrice. The entire button and light scheme is confusing and cryptic. I hate these headphones and will strongly recommend against buying one. I am so frustrated with them that after an year that I bought them I have come back to write a review.
2,Just Okay.....,"The product is great when it is working properly. It's a tight fit and when doing any type of walking, it tends to slip down."
5,Excellent!!,"They work great, I get good reception even through concrete walls. I get proably 30 plus feet range. I am using them with a Dell Axim X51V and I had alot of problems getting the bluetooth link to work and it even cuts off from time to time, but this is on the PDA side not the headphones."
2,lousy,These headphones had the worst sound of any Ive tried. They crackled no matter how close or far I was from bluetooth device. Returned
2,Only for people who don't love music,"Can't expect too much from A2DP bluetooth headphone technology these days I guess, but still the sound quality is too low for me to use this thing. Lot of digital ""artifacts"" and static sounds really preclude any enjoyment using this headphone. The silly lights are ridiculous (can be turned off, but has to be done after *every* charge). The technology for wireless music just isn't here yet."
1,Not compatible with Treo 700P,"I returned this item as it was not compatible with my Treo 700P which only supports Bluetooth 1.2 (but without the control protocols).I can't really rate this item as I didn't get to hear any stereo sound from it. I put 1 star, which is really more of a rating of the Bluetooth capabilities of my PDA phone."
1,"Defective, or just a bad product?","Where to start?The Good: Actually does handshake with both my Vista computer and blackjack phoneThe Bad:1. Sounds terrible, lots of clipping, on the Blackjack.2. Does not work right at all on the Vista box. The sound clips, comes in and out, randomly disconnects, etc.3. Does not work with Skype on Vista.4. You can do a ""workaround"" by plugging it in via usb (so why buy bluetooth then?) and the sound quality is passable, but certainly not great.The really bad: The headphones where cheap enough that the hassle of returning them probably isn't worth it. Where are they now? Back of a drawer."
4,It works! But...,"They work, but, they are a bit bulky. The volume doesn't adjust all that well and they leak music due to the design. However, the advantage of being completely wireless outweighs these slight disadvantages."
3,"Jabra headset - Good sound, a bit heavy","PROS:I bought these sets after reading good comments from folks. Headset is pretty nice and sound quality is great as well. It takes getting use to the button on the headset as they are bit fragile.CONS:The headset is on the heavy side. If you are looking for a lightweight headset this might not be the solution.In all I was happy with the set, minus my light weight requirement."
2,Not loud enough and the range is not-as-advertised.,"I planned to use these headphones while doing yardwork, including mowing and weed whacking. These headphones do not get loud enough for use in this application. The 30-foot range is, well, it AIN'T!I won't buy anything like this via mail order again. A hands-on demo would have nixed these without spending the money first."
1,Beware using this product,"I used this product and added it to my air cond system and it apparently work too well .I cannot add any new refrigerant , I try right after adding and t would not go in.Do not buy this product unless you have completely add new refig.and may never be allowed."
1,seals great stopped compressor,Put it in as directions said now ac compressor froze up.no ac problems anymore - just roll down windows.
5,For the Love of the Team,"Temple University Press has published some notable team histories in this on-going series. The Sox Encyclopedia however, is at the top rung of the ladder for its completeness, quality of photos, and crisp writing. Even Cub fans are envious, considering how badly done the Cub book was, in comparison. Only a true believer and a died-in-the-wool fan could have produced such an epic labor of love as this -- 600 plus pages of facts, figures, trivia, stories and Sox folklore. Lindberg is controversial in his opinions. A lot of Sox fans don't agree with him, but few doubt his knowledge of team history. Fans of the South Side team who haven't read this book are really missing out on something. Lindberg concludes with the 1997 season. I hope there is an update in the works. No one writes books about the Sox these days, let's face it. But then again no one writes about the Sox like this guy either."
2,all you wouldn't want to know about the White Sox,"I found this encyclopedia to be boring, overlong and slackly written"
2,Not worth it.,"The starburst and skittles ones irritated my lips, making them bright red and itchy, later drying my lips immensely. After about 10 minutes, the smell can be nauseating. Stick to the original, cosmic, ice creamies or even soda lines. Stay away from all candy lipsmackers."
5,My 4 year old boy has read three books already!,"As a homeschooler, I was a little hesitant with the idea of teaching my children to read with phonics, since I don't really remember how I learned myself - I just remember reading! I read to all three of them a lot, and was just hoping it would happen without any worries about phonics and such.Happily, we received this set from my mom for Christmas, and my oldest is ""reading"" already! He doesn't sound out words, but he definitely uses context clues, letter sounds, and the bright simple pictures to help figure out what the next word is.The poster with stickers is a huge bonus. He's so pleased he has seven books left, and asks to practice reading about once a day, even wanting to read to his little brother and sister. Between reading and learning Spanish with Flip Flop Spanish, his ""curriculum"" is full and FUN! I'm thrilled with this product, and look forward to getting the next set soon!"
1,GET THIS MOVIE IF YOU LIKE WATHCING OLD PEOPLE BLABBLE...,"HORRIBLE... this is like some infommercial for senior citizens. I don't know how long it is because I trashed the video after watching it for five minutes and fast-forwarding through the rest. I thought maybe something cool would happen when the cat came out but no dice... if you like listening to your grandparents babble on about nothing, then you'll love this video. Otherwise I would suggest getting Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back."
1,MY DAD LIKED IT,"MY FATHER LIKED IT WE SAT DOWN AND WATCHED IT WE WERE ENJOYINGIT THEN MY FAMILY SAT DOWN AND ALSO LIKED IT.THANK YOU FOR A GOOD TIME SPENT""LIL""PETE"
1,Not worth the money,"No real info here, very short tape, and not very funny. I was majorly disappointed."
1,"It's humor so lighten up people, but not worth the $, not even close.","It's just a video of grandpa talking about marijuana and old people getting high. Sure some may be true but mostly it's all a joke, satire. For example his cat reading the Wall Street Journal because the pot made it so smart, or a quote in the bible about Adam & Eve smoking out. So to the people stating the info is dangerous, lighten up! It's a joke!But, the price it no joke and it's not funny. I didn't pay to see the video, but if I had I would be upset. It's more of a YouTube vid than something you should be paying for, it's 24 minutes long and 99% of it just grandpa sitting at a desk in his home telling his funny stories, nothing more.The low star rating is because of the price, had it been free on youtube I'd probably give it a 3 or 4"
2,Perhaps for older children.,"I got this for my 5 year old who is a huge fan of PR but unbeknownst to me I thought I was ordering Jungle Fury, however I saw that it's a different team. The main complaint are their masks, primarily sharkboy's, anyway, he isn't thrilled about it as the other ones. Some of the pictures inside are a bit confusing, he keeps asking me what is this picture suppose to be? It looks like psychedelic plasma or something, don't know. Either way, I don't think it's great for 5 year olds, perhaps for those who are more familiar with this team though. Anyway....quick shipping though! :) And I usually like Dalmation Press books."
3,practical construction of warships by RN Newton.,"As the copy I received was too old(the latest edition is 1972)I returned it toseller and received a ""No fuss"" refund.I cannot,therefore, submit a review.yours sincerely,Lenny Harris."
4,Love this book,I love this book its like a mystery mixed with a fantasy I hope to read all of the guardians of ga' hool. I think my favorite character is Gilfy.
5,Action-packed!,"This book was very action packed. Where is Ezylryb? Who is the brutal owl named Metalbeak? What can the flecks do to owl's brains? The end is shocking, and like many other Guardians of Ga'Hoole books, it leaves you with many other questions yet to be answered. If you liked this book, Read the next book, too. It's even better. I recommend ""The Rescue"" to kids eight and up.-An book-loving 11-year-old"
5,best book ever,K.T.SAs soren suddenly realises that Ezylrybe is missing. so he and the band go leave and search for him. this book is very exciting because Soren and The band go searching for Ezylrybe and go searching everywhere for him.
5,What a hoot!,"The last of the Guardians of Ga'hoole series, this book is by far the most interesting. Soren is finally with his sister, but his favorite ryb (teacher) has been missing for two months! Soren, Eglantine (his sister), Gylfie, Twilight, Digger, and Otulissa embark on a quest to discover the intentions of Metal Beak and the strange disappearance of Ezylryb. What will drop your gizzard at the end of this one? Read it and find out!"
5,Blues to Keep,"This blues artist has delivered an impressive package in ""Destiny."" With a rich,smooth yet commanding voice,Buddy covers all the bases as far as tempo and styling go. You'll find familiar cover tunes -""Fire and Rain"" and ""Saint James Infirmary""- quite creatively arranged and produced.There's humor in the rollicking ""Bigg-Leggedd Woman""and heartbreak in the tender ballad ""Still Missing You."" I like the variety in material and the uniformity in high quality sound recording from cut to cut."
3,Some politcal songs and a few overlooked gems,"While the cause of Human Rights is noble, it doesn't always work as the central theme for a musical program. Maybe that's why self consciously political songs from Lou Reed, Peter Gabriel, Bob Geldof and Jackson Browne on Secret Policeman's Third Ball seem a bit forced at times. On the other hand, cuts from Joan Armatrading and Kate Bush and a guitar duet by Mark Knopfler and Chet Atkins that don't consciously try to follow the human rights theme are more enjoyable. Bush's 'Running Up That Hill' is outstanding with Dave Gilmour accompanying on guitar but the real gem here is from relatively unknown(in the US) singer\songwriter Karl Wallinger. Together with his band World Party, Wallinger gives an incendiary performance of 'Ship of Fools', a straight ahead rocker about colonialism no less! At least for five minutes or so music and the human struggle for freedom come together perfectly. This one's worth it just for Kate Bush and World Party."
5,EPICNESS,"Awesome idea, Great art work, a must see for any Otaku or Anime lover, Afro Samurai is totally Bad Ass"
5,AFRO SAMURAI review,"PERFECT CONDITION, HILARIOUS, GREAT DVD SET!! I LOVE IT!! VERY ENJOYABLE for ANYONE who likes MARTIAL ARTS and LOVES COMEDY!!"
1,Horrible mistake by el Judio Maravilloso DO NOT BUY!!!!,"This album was a terrible release by Larry Harlow. It is the first and only one of his that would feature 3 females on vocals. Goes to show how great Celia Cruz really was as she was the only one (along with most recently La India) to make an impact on a male-dominant genre. The female's vocals are just annoying and unfit for salsa. Also, the music is a terrible blend between salsa and disco that really just was the biggest failure I've seen happen to salsa. It hurts to say this since I truly love Harlow's music (a big influence on musical tastes) but, I have to say, this album should not have been recorded, released or even thought of. Even 1 star is too much to give. Horrible."
2,SSG work n' ride leather gloves,"I bought these especially because they were advertised as lined. They are NOT lined. They are a well made, unlined leather glove, reinforced for rein use. I am not as happy as I'd hoped I'd be because I wanted them for riding on the beach in cold conditions. They are no warmer than SSG all purpose gloves because they are unlined."
4,Love these gloves,"I love these gloves, for their price, they really can't be beat. I've had mine for over a year, and they've held up really well (I ride at least 4 times a week with them). Like another reviewer said, they aren't really ""lined"" and are more like a thin sweatshirt-type material. They are warmer than regular summer gloves, but not super warm. I actually like them because they are thin and I can still feel the reins easily. I don't care for bulky gloves. If you are doing riding in the extreme cold, these may not be the gloves for you, but they're great for winter riding for me!"
3,They're okay.,"I purchased these for my daughter and I to share. Both of us agree that, while they are well made, they aren't really all that warmer than regular gloves. They are not lined and our fingers froze.So while we can't really call them winter riding gloves, we can use the for regular riding in the spring and fall."
4,Great riding gloves,My 14 yr old son is very pleased with these gloves. He says they are comfortable and fit great.
3,meh....,Worked well while they lasted. They began to tear after two to three months of use. jkl; jkl; jkl; jkl;
5,nice fit and good-looking gloves,"These are very good-looking gloves. They fit well and are warm, too. They give a good grip, so I can feel the reins to keep a light touch."
4,Good gloves,"Simply put they are good, wish they provided a little more wind resistance but they work fine during the fall."
2,Gloves Wear Down Easily,Gloves look nice and fit nice. Warning: Don't try to do too much wearing this. I guess they're for looks only. The person I bought them for showed me where they are coming apart already! Very dissatisfied.
4,Oneness: Great Principles Shared by All Religions,"This is a great little book with a lot to say. I have re-read it many times and enjoy it more each time. Mr. Moses took the time, that I wouldn't have, to research many religions to show their similarity - very interesting and insightful. A great read for those needing inspiration and peace."
2,"Interesting formula book, but","Overly simplistic, but cute. Mirrors other books using same formula. Oddly, some of his books ""Appear"" to be on completely different topics, but follow the same formula. - Nice gift, but not sure I would have bought it for myself if I had held it in my hands before buying."
5,Awesome stuff,"I have very fine hair that is very damaged because I prefer to be blond rather than my natural dark dishwater brown. This stuff makes my hair so smooth and soft, it gives it body if I want to dry it straight and when I diffuse it to get a curly look it is now way less frizzy than it used to be. I love it. And it smells great. I like to put a dab on even when I don't have time to wash my hair just to freshen it up. I also got the 32oz size not realizing it is gigantic. Probably a lifetime supply."
3,Expiration Date,"I was about to return the product because I thought that the date at the top was the expiration date but after calling AG myself they told me that the date is actually the date that it was made and that it has a 2 year shelf life after that. I have not used it yet because I am waiting for the AG Re:Coil Curl Activator to get here. I have used the Re:Coil before and it is a 5 star for me so I figured I'd try it with the same brands leave-in. I am a 3b curly girl and have lots of it so I want a product that adds bounce, no crunch, and no poofiness, the Re:Coil does just that, I love it. What I can say about this product so far is that it smells great! I will post another review once I actually use it."
1,no good for me,I got this ag leave on cuz it had a lot of good reviews and my girlfriend told me it was good as well I think not so good I did not like this product at all
1,ADVERTISED FREE SHIPPING FOR PURCHASE OF TWO,Does not give you free shipping when purchase of two as advertised. Careful when ordering.
5,perfect addition to hallway,"After searching and pricing, target had the best deal for this type of coat rack..I am very pleased with the product I received. No problems with shipment and it arrived as promised. I am very happy with my purchase, and it is a great accent piece in my hallway."
3,Not very candid or hard-hitting,"I thought this book was moderately interesting. I was expecting each of these executives to discuss challenges they've faced and how they've overcome them, but instead they mainly talked of how difficult it is to sell tickets and how they're lucky to have such great fans in their city. I was not enthralled with the book but there were a few interesting points in it. If you're new to the business of sports, this book will cover many different angles to help you understand what's out there. If you're an established professional however, you're not going to learn much from this book."
5,Excellent,"At first I wasn't very impressed with the cover of the book BUT the cliche of ""You can'tjudge a book by its cover"" was created for this situation.I found the first 20 or so pages of character development to be a little slow but they did provided valuable information about the characters as well as historical information about the relations of China and Taiawn that are part of what made this book great. Once the action began I couldn't put it down and practically finished it in one sitting."
5,Thought Provoking and Relevant,"This story is right out of today's headlines. This novel weaves current events and possible scenarios together to make an exciting, can't put it down, thriller. The characters are believable, and the political climate, credible. The combat scenes are very realistic and the chess play of global strategy is impressive. Use of the Surfboard as a Task Force Guidon was very Southern California Army National Guard. This was a great book to read."
5,China Attacks,DeVore and Mosher have done their homework and have written an exciting fast paced novel crammed with current and breaking events. They have selected key characters that allow the reader to follow the events with views from all sides.
5,Great and fast read,Love the book. Learnd a lot what else can you ask for in a book. If you like war books get this.
2,Disapointing,"The early parts of this book show some real promise, though the characters are not very well developed and the early American involvement in the invasion lacks realism.The real problem, though, is that this book dies quickly at the end and leaves virtually every story line unfinished."
1,Good.....to a point,Good writing up to the point the author(s) have the American public backing down from the Chinese with out a shot fired.....either these guys are stupid or don't understand America.
2,"Could have been great, but......","One of the problems with authors who do a lot of ""armchair"" alternative history is that for whatever reason, many of them seem to be extremely zealous neo-conservatives. I would remind everyone that Nixon made friends with red China and it was a group put together by Kissisnger and his budddies that acted as a ""go-between"" for business between China and US businesses for years. If he would have stuck more to the formula that was used by Tom Clancy this would have been a more enjoyable light read. But the author's incessant need to get his own political agenda accross coupled with inconsistant pacing makes this one a last resort if you have already exhusted everything else in the genre."
4,Great 4AD post punk!,"this is an awesome release, from an awesome band. They are like a gothic Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. A folky Bauhaus. The vocals croon through the chaotic beats, the jangling guitars, and the brooding bass very nicely. I never get tired of it. Though they have rarely matched the brilliance of Cut The Tree, what they HAVE accomplished is no small feat."
5,Can't Stop Listening,"If you like smooth, sexy R&B, this CD is for you. The title cut is great--what EVERY woman wants to hear from a man. The up-beat songs are great too. You definately won't fall asleep listening to this music. I've played the CD over and over again. It's one of my favorites."
3,Queen Mary,"This model when finished was very good looking but, as many parts were broken off and loose in the box. i was missing some of the pieces requiring me to make do with the pieces I had."
4,Works as claimed,I had some issues with bettas getting fungus on their wounds after breeding and this dosing helped them make full recoveries.
1,DANGER KILLS SNAILS,"Alougth this product does clear fungus on fish and rotting food you must consider what it will do to your tank. When you open the package and look at a tablet it is yellow not clear as shown, when a tablet dissolves it releases a blue dye and before all the little particles fully dissolve they settle on everything and where the tablet settled there will be an abundance of these particles. If you have a snail in your tank remove it or you will have a dead snail. The package only says it is safe for all freshwater fish and plants does not say what it is toxic to. Don't forget that it turns your tank water sickly colors."
3,Street Rhymes Froom Around the World,I purchased this book for my college International Children's Literature class. It is a very colorful book and has the rhymes in English and in the Native language of where the rhyme originated from. I would like to hear an audio version of the book to hear how the rhymes go and how many use the same song as our children.
4,A good resource,"A diverse selection of game rhymes from all over the world. If you are someone who works with children, like a teacher, day care provider, Girl Scout or Boy Scout leader, you could use this to show diversity."
2,Stupid game but play it the way you want.,"My husband brought me this home one day because he knows I am a huge Sopranos fan. This game is idiotic. I read the directions 10 times and still dont know how you play it. Its better for a drinking game. Play with a group of friends, ask a question. If they are wrong - drink. If they are right - dont drink. The stupid game pieces and board you should just throw straight in the trash and just keep the trivia cards and play it as a drinking game like I told ya! Capiche?"
3,Had to change the rules,"We received this game as a gift, and I agree with the fellow reviewers, this game is terrible! The game designers didn't even game test.But my wife and I decided to change the rules some. Perhaps this might help?You start the game with 25 points. Your goal is to obtain 50 points. You place bets on if you think the other player has a chance to answer their questions correctly. You lose points if you guess incorrectly. The most you can bet on any one question is 3 points.The game seems to flow better using these rule modifications."
1,What a waste,"Like everyone before said, the board and pieces suck as well as the so-called rules of gameplay...which make no sense.Now, all that aside, the game would still be fun if you wanted to just ask questions, right?? WRONGAll of the questions are way too easy for a TRUE Sopranos fan.We were done with these questions way too soon....What a waste"
3,This game should work at Bada Bing,"(Because it's cheap and fast.)The cards are stamped out of flimsy cardboard, and the chips aren't poker chips at all, but only Yahtzee chips.It's kind of fun betting against the other players though, making the game not only about knowing your Soprano's trivia, but also about knowing your opponents. Instead of categories of questions, there are levels of difficulty, which ultimately means that it takes only a short while to play a round--unlike other trivia games that can eat your entire evening. It's strange that players pick their own levels though.My recommendation: don't pay too much for it, and even though it comes in a seriously cool tin, don't take it too seriously."
1,stupid as crap,I got this as a Christmas gift. This game was the WORST game i have ever played. The directions for the game is ridiculous and stupid and we had no desire to even seriously consider playing it. I got it for free as a gift and i still feel ripped off and want my money back. I can't imagine actually paying for it. I am sure the cast is very embarrassed that this game sucks so bad. The questions are ludicrous and there are misspellings and bad grammar as well. It is like they let some 9 year old kid make his own board game and only gave him an hour to do it. DON'T GET IT.
5,"Great for kids, too","My toddler has been begging me for a green hard hat (his very favorite color) and all the kid hard hats I could find were yellow. This one, when adjusted, fits his head nicely and isn't too heavy."
2,12 hard hats 12 that is twelve,well I got 12 hard hats in the mail. I now see where it says 12 but I do not feel this was properly stated. More importantly the woman who returned my call acted as though this happens often and she had an additude about it. I mean who buys 12 hard hats and why does it not say in the title 12 hard hats. 25% restocking fee it would seem to me they make money off not making it clear that you are getting 12
5,Red!!!,"Nice, does what it supposed to. Comfortable and easy to use. You will find out that almost no one has a red one."
5,I'll trust my life to it,"Just got it yesterday so I can bring down a big dead oak tree that limbs break and fall out of routinely. Decided I wasnt going to work beneath those limbs without a hardhat because one TBI is the only one you need to ruin your life, so, found this helmet. Very comfortable, very sturdy, I'll trust my life to it. I am confident should anything fall and hit me at least I can save my skull."
4,Good for my needs,I bought this for part of my CERT kit. It fits well and its comfortable. Im not sure I would trust it for true construction work but it fits in for what I need it for.
5,Great Hat,My husband bought this hard hat because it wasn't your plain white hard hat. He likes the color and it gets the job done.
5,Don't Be Afraid!,"In this little book we find baby Donald going to his first day at play group. He is a little afraid and isn't sure he will want to stay there.All the little babies try to make Donald feel better. They tell him to sing and clap,make him a picture and let him play in the sand. By the end of the day baby Donald can't wait to come back again.A great little book to help relieve the fear a little one may have concerning nursery or school.Shirley JOhnson"
4,Well Done!,I'm not really a science fiction fan but a friend recommended the book so I read it. It's a story about the human need to have a purpose in life. I found it very enjoyable. I know this is a first novel and the book encourages me to expect more work from this new author.
4,Evolution,"This book could use some better marketing and editing but I enjoyed the book front to back. The story was intriguing and the characters interesting.I've checked the author website and it appears more work is coming, I think this is one to watch out for as her first book was good despite errors that should have been removed in editing. You can get a sample of the book on the publisher site and more of her work on a website called Authorsden.comI bought the book and find it a worthwhile addition to my collection."
5,A book that transforms you effortlessly,"Having worked closely with Jacqueline Cullen on workshops and classes throughout 2002, it has been an honour and a privilege to be the illustrator and editor of her book.Jacqueline has a wonderful way of telling her story of overcoming addiction in a poetic fashion. Her book involves the senses. To read it is not just information, it is an experience. It makes you feel something. Regardless of your background, this book will cause you to shift on some level."
4,Power Strip,"It was hard to find one with a cord this long, most cords are only 3-4', It's well made and should last forever."
5,All hail the Moe-God!,"Woo-hoo! Go you crazy Moe! You rocking, sleazing, bad-copywriter-drawing, carnivorous creative director dream-having crazy piece of wordboy. You're an inspiration, Moe, to anyone who ever got laid off from an ad agency, watched bad TV with his pixel-monkey, went without for more days than any man should and really truly believes three chords and a Mexican-built Stratocaster makes for an instant ticket to Credville. Why'd they stop printing your book Moe? Why? Whyyyyyyyyyyyy?!!"
5,Beautifully realized and executed,"Marley's meditation on age, faith, and humanity is at once universal and very, very personal. My personal favorite of her books so far, The Child Goddess manages to deal with many different issues but at the same time retain direction and feeling. In particular, the character of Oa is one who has stuck with me long after I finished the novel. All in all, a wonderful read."
5,Book,Bought this and then realized it was a duplicate of something we already had. Gave it as a gift instead of returning.
2,Drek,"OK, the drawings were sort of cute, and I wasn't expecting something the same as the movie but rather something different that would be outstanding in a different way.What I got was a not particularly clever short story, with a vocabulary containing some words that must be 5th or 6th grade level (not good for ""reading time"" with the five-year-old) that didn't really say anything except ""I can do a fairy tale backwards"". They lived ""horribly ever after"", clever.Am I being too harsh? Perhaps, but at least do yourself a favor and try to see a library copy before you plunk down money and reserve bookshelf space."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book based on the rave reviews and the fact that our local library did not have the book. The vocabulary and word usage were, in my opinion, too complicated for the target age group. The story was, however, too juvenile for my older children and it was not very interesting to me as an adult. The movie is loosely based on the story, however, the similarities stop after the initial idea that an ogre is the main character. Usually, I prefer the book to the movie that has been created in the image of the book, but that is not so in this case. Before buying this, I would suggest trying to get it through your local library loan program."
1,Inappropriate for Children,"I can't express how disappointed I am with this book. My daughter was so excited about it, and when we started listening to it I was shocked. The concept itself is oustanding - an outcast is proud of himself, even when no one else will have anything to do with him. It's such a shame that the language in the book is completely inappropriate for 4 year olds. I'm so sorry that I didn't pre-read it, it would have never been something to which I would have let my daughter listen. If you're really interested in this book, take the time to borrow it from the library. I'll be returning my copy."
2,"Horrible Ogre, horrible book...","My children and I both loved the movie, but the book is far from it. No real redeeming value you here. The story was dumb and gross. Shrek is an Ogre, so no real surprise I guess. W. Steig's book, ""The Real Thief,"" on the other hand, was a gem."
1,"It you like the movie, do not get this book.","I recently discovered that the movie Shrek was based upon this book and decided to purchase it. Other than the name of the main character, there are no similarities to the movie. There was even a picture of Donkey on the back of the book, but he turned out to be an ancillary character. This book is poorly written and very tedious. I was very disappointed with this book and hopefully saved someone their time and money through this review."
3,shrek!,"The title of this book was shrek!,written by William Steig.the book was about this man name shrek he was a ugly looking monster uglier then his own parents.Everyone was scared of him because he looked very mean and nasty.Shrek had some powers and one of them is that he can shoot flames of fire out of his mouth.Shrek's parents decided to let shrek go on his own to let him experience more about life.Shrek was very exited to go out and explore more about the surprises that life had for him.Shrek wanted to get married with a princess so he was going to look for one.Shrek had an idea of where to go look, so he went to the castle of the most ugliest princess alive.Shrek had tought about it and he said that if he married a ugly princess like him they would be the two most happiest couples ever.The unthinkable happened shrek got married to the ugliest princess and they lived happly ever after."
3,OK.....,"This book was good in that it makes the reader want to read on. but Brietta having the ""love-at-first sight"" experience was quite ridiculous.I liked Brave Eagle's determination to win Brietta over but not his thoughtlessness to Brietta about her twin. The mixup was frustrating. * Don't p'ple ever notice their difference in eye color??? * finally the twins settle down with their cherokee heroes. it's quite a story if you like stories which sound like fairytales. (Don't they all?)"
2,Sound and Picture Sync Issue,"I bought this tv a few months ago and it seemed the picture and sound were not in sync. My husband thought I was making this up...obviously NOT! TV is still under warranty, so I'll call Westinghouse and see if they'll take care of the problem. My suggestion is to buy a different tv, it's very annoying watching this and not really all that cheap."
2,Great picture; serious service problems,"We purchased this TV because we thought the picture quality was very good for the price. It worked like a charm for 8 months and then stopped working. It has a 1-year warranty and Best Buy is their repair service. To make a long story short, our TV needs a new circuit board. What does that mean for people who are shopping for a new TV? Perhaps nothing; TV circuits randomly go bad all the time. But it turns out that there is such a need for the specific replacement part that our TV required that it is on backorder for a month. So that's my review. Good picture quality, but it seems that they need a lot of repairs. I can't think of another explanation for such a high demand for spare parts."
2,Audio/Video Sync Confirmed,"Yes, I can confirm that this model has a SERIOUS audio/video sync problem as described in another review. Too bad. Other than that the TV seems acceptable."
1,Don't Buy,"I bought this TV for $375 as an open box item at Best Buy. I was only looking for a 20 inch television, but for the same price how could I pass up a 26 inch? First of all, I started experiencing the audio sync problem everyone else reports. Secondly, I have this unit hooked up to a Bose 3-2-1 system, and every time I power off the television and turn it back on I get no sound until I go back into the audio settings, turn on the internal speakers and then turn them off again. I am on my way back to the store to return the TV right now."
1,A piece of junk,OK HD picture but terrible for standard broadcast. The worst sound I've ever heard coming from any TV. Returned this TV and bought A Sharp which is terrific. The price may seem right but it isn't worth it. I guess it's true that you get what you pay for!
2,"Sound sync problems Westinghouse SK-26H240S 26"" LCD HDTV Television","Same as others - great picture - lousy sound sync. I kept hoping that it was a temporary issue. Thought it was because I was not receiving HDTV broadcast. Now, after reading these reviews, I wish that I had returned it."
5,The Lavalier Secret,"I was reluctant to go with the cheaper, battery operated lower end Lavalier.So, I bit the bullet, and paid [...] bucks for this Pro 45.Mind you I am blessed to have a Locker full of exotic and pro hi end mics, so I know a good mic when I hear one.-1st In the box, and paperwork inside the little red Box, there is no mention of lvalier. It is however, a PRO XLR connector,2- It is Phantom power (no battery)3- It sounds incredible!4- There is no wireless issues.5- It is hide worthy, and built sturdy enough to do the job capturing nuance.6- has a 20' connection is beautiful.7- For video, I am running this into a decent pre, and it sounds like Big time Network television. A few more bucks, but I feel like i have another decent mic in the collection.Happy with this for a New cast type Lavalier use. If it works for you is a matter of taste/ style/ use/ opinion. For sound quality, This, on the lapelle with a goof gate/ expander, I should not even be writing this secret !Have fun."
2,not great sound,"I bought this as a choir mic. It does not pick up the low tones. It is a nice mic if you need some fill, but if you plan on only using a single type of mic you need something better to pick up all the tones.It is a good mic for the high end, and that is all I can say about it."
3,ITS NOT GLUTEN FREE,its organic veg-friendly but not gluten free. Got sick. Its my fault for not checking. Just assumed it was gluten free. Dont make the same mistake i did.
1,Moldy Probars,"I recently discovered mold growing on more than one pricey, freshly opened PB&J; Probar with an expiry of July 2012. The packaging did not appear to be compromised in any way. Also read of similar experience here: [...]Needless to say, I won't be purchasing more Probars any time soon."
5,great for backpacking,my dad and I love these for backpacking lunches. this and one other bar will do for a high energy lunch.
2,"Would be great emergency food, if you're really, really, hungry.","Definitely try before you buy quanities. The peach and honey graham would be ""tasty"" if you had not eaten in a few days. The Maple peacn is OK. I am, obviously, one of the too many americans with too much sugar in my diet."
2,Tastes Awful,"It had the potential of tasting good, but tastes absolutely awful to me. Whole berry blast was much better.Try one of these bars before you buy the box."
2,"Healthy? I'm sure, but tasty? Not for me...","Granted, I don't have a lot of experience with power bars or health bars or meal replacement bars or anything. I just wanted to find something to hold me over during the workday.Today I got to try it for the first time, and the other 11 bars are getting thrown in the garbage. This really had a unpalatable flavor to me, just something I had to spit out.They ARE made with a good consistency though, not too squishy, and more importantly, not rock solid... So you won't break a tooth biting into one of these like some I've seen people eating.So if you liked any of their other flavors, you may like it, but if you don't normally eat anything like this, be prepared..."
4,Easy trail food,Three of Probars makes a satisfactory lunch. I eat them over the course of the day. it doesn't get any easier than that. This my number three flavor after berry blast and banana. they are a little heavy.
1,I found hard things,"I am sorry, but I have to give a bad review. I found little hard things in some to the bars, like wallnut shells or little rocks? But I can't eat them, this buy was a loss, money down the drian.."
1,These have rocks,"I keep biting into hard things like little rocks. I'm not going to finish the rest, I'll break a tooth!"
4,Great tasting & filling!,"I use these as lunch substitutes every other day during the week. So far, this is one that I'll reorder. PBJ is my fave so far & the next up is the Banana."
4,Tastes good,"I like the bar as a meal alternative, just don't like the high carb gram count. Real organic ingredients are a relief for a processed food."
5,I am in love with this bar.,"The ""Whole Berry Blast"" flavor Pro Bar is fantastic. It is loaded with juicy raisins, generous chocolate chips, and whole, plump chunks of fruit throughout. If you like the idea of whole-food, organic nutrition and enjoy a dense bar, chock full of whole almonds, nut bits, and loaded with seeds (flax), this is definitely the one for you.*Tip: I strongly recommend ""stretching"" Pro Bars out by kneading it in the package 'til you reach the seams -- makes them much bigger - but just as dense - and last much longer."
5,Favorite nutrition bar,"PRO BAR is my favorite of all nutritional bars. It contains real ingredients that you can recognize and pronounce, no fillers. You can actually see the whole ingredients in the bar. They taste good without being overly sweet like other popular bars. Filling without being heavy. Great energy before a long run or bike ride."
4,good but not great,"I have purchased a few different flavors of Probar products, and this by far is the worst tasting one. I only got it because it seems to be the healthiest of all of them, and still keeps me full, but it takes a while to adjust to the horrible taste."
5,Customer,I had tried this bar on numerous previous occasions and decided I needed to buy it in bulk. I work out 7 days/wk; 365/yr and think this is one of the best bars on the market. It is more a meal substitute than strictly an energy bar. No sugars. All natural. Koko Moka is my personal favorite but the other flavors are great as well. Try it and you will see.
2,"It's not Eastmountainsouth, and that's too bad","The general rule (with notable exceptions) is that solo albums from members of a great band are never as good as the band's unified magic. Think the Beatles. Think the Eagles. Think 10,000 Maniacs.Peter Bradley Adams without Kat Maslich Bode is too gloomy, dark, and monotonous. The magic is gone, Pete. He can write beautiful music, but Kat Bode's voice made the songs soar, while the two together made complex harmonies that are glaringly missing from this album. Eastmountainsouth was a phenomenal group, a brilliant album, and if Peter B. Adams knows what's good for him, he'll get on a plane out of L.A. go back to Virginia, and get Bode to record these songs over with him. Not one track on this album can hold a candle to ""Show Me the River,"" and anyone who's listened to that track (chime in here, folks) will agree. When ya comin' home, Pete Adams?"
2,Good....but,"I agree with the previous commenter as far as this is NOT Eastmountainhigh.The comment/review on eastmountainhigh is right on: ""Kat Maslich's is a classic folk voice, warm and resonant, and Peter Adams' counter melodies are always beautiful. ""Peter's music and voice are wonderful, but it needs Kat to play against. Alone his voice is too predictable and verging on monotonous.KAC"
2,Bring Back the Kat!,"His voice lacks the magical harmonics created within the ems mix. I heard one cut on the radio, singed in here and bought his CD. But I won't memorize these songs, use them at a wedding or funeral as I did ems. They lack the magic that draws you to them. As a woman, I loved blending with Kat's voice. As a musician, I admired the harmonics in their special blend. Please reunite! You will do much better in the music world and please your old fans so much!!!"
5,R&B Flavor,"This CD set is sonically gorgeous and stylistically tight.I am a huge fan of The Band AKA and Michael Cruz and was thrilledwith the quality of this release.If you love R&B; dance and ballads, you shouldn't miss getting this one!"
2,Too condensed for me,"This book was a little too condensed for me. The most useful thing was a trip itinerary of what to see if you are there for 1, 2, or 3 days. The descriptions of the top sites were very limited to a couple of paragraphs with a tiny picture. You will have to have a guided tour or buy a guide book of each site you visit, because there is little info in this book. The language section was ok and the restaurant section was pretty good. The hotel section was a little sparse but you should probably book on-line before you get there. I would suggest saving yourself the money and space by copying the itinerary suggestions on a post-it and look elsewhere for info."
1,Poles win the prize?,"So the Poles were the first victims of the Nazis? Really? The Holocaust started with them and not the Jews? Fascinating. I've been reading international scholarship on the Holocaust for thirty years, and this is pathetic revisionism. Of course the Poles suffered terribly at every level, of course they were murdered in Auschwitz, of course Hitler loathed them and all Slavs--but to claim some sort of superior victim status, and to deny or explain away Polish historic anti-Semitism--which predates Communism and thrives with barely no Jews--is disgusting."
5,Great HD TV,"I bought this set App 3 months ago.Plugged it in.great picture and sound,Have not hand any problems at all. Good BUYReal BouffardWallkill N.Y."
3,Yo-Yo Ma aiming for suavity in Schumann,"Yo-Yo Ma isn't exactly the anti-Rostropovich. He is capable of fervor in his lower-key way, but to me the Schumann Cello Concerto cries out for more than smooth savity of tone and impeccable manners, which is what Ma offers here, abetted by a sleepwalking accompaniment from Colin Davis. Du Pre and Rostropovich throw themselves into this music as if their souls depend on it, carrying the work along in one grand sweep of emotion. If you think their approach is over the top, here is its opposite. Likewise, although Ax and Ma make a familir partnership, I wish they would show more passion in the various works for piano and cello. Compared to Britten and Rostropovich on Decca, these readings belong in a quiet Victorian hotel lobby."
4,Portable saw with power!,After burning out the motor in a DeWalt benchtop saw I replaced it with the Bosch 4000. This saw is easily the most powerful portable saw I've used. I've ripped several hundred feet of 4/4 & 8/4 hard maple with excellent results. It did require a good thin kerf rip blade however. The fence seems accurate and reliable though probably not as much so as the rack & pinion Dewalt. The motor adjusts easily both in height and for bevel cuts. I also like the support extensions.
2,Good saw with built in flaw,"Please don't get me wrong, this saw starts and runs like a fine sports car and the fence system is extremely precise. But if you need a saw that makes repeated cuts the same depth for dados or kerfs, this is not the saw you want to own. When you start the saw, the start-up vibration causes the saw blade to drop about 1/16 of an inch because there is no blade depth locking mechanism (the built in flaw). After each cut, it is necessary to readjust the blade height if you are making precise depth cuts and proper adjustment is almost impossible because when you start the saw the blade drops again. I wish I could say it was just a problem with the one I bought but Bosch sent me a replacement saw after I discovered this problem on the first use. The replacement saw had the same problem. I returned both saws."
1,Why not save $450 instead and get a Ryobi or Delta,"Don't get me wrong - I love Bosch saws, in fact I got the Bosch 3915 compound sliding 10"" mitersaw less than a year ago on Amazon for $379 - Which brings me to my point: This is a small light-duty table saw thats fine for small home projects, so why is it priced at $579!!!I got a Ryobi tablesaw with almost identical specs (13 amp) on sale at Home Depot for $89 last summer (regular price is $99!), and Lowes has a Delta for about the same price. My Ryobi is cast aluminum table with a resin base, just like the Bosch. Sure this Bosch has it's ""soft-start"" motor, and it appears to have a domewhat better guide -- But is that worth $450 more???No - I don't own this saw, and have never used it, and I'm sure it good quality, but again this (like my Ryobi) is a utilitarian tabelsaw and nothing more! And just think what other tools you could get with that extra cash!"
5,Best guide for the GMAT,"While this won't apply to everyone, I used this review during the 12 days studying that I had to study for the test and was able to boost my estimated score by about 100 points. In the end I got a 710 on this test, so that should provide a good selling point.The best aspect of this book is that it teaches you how to think like the test makers. On all of the practice problems there is a solid explanation for the correct answer along with justifications for the false answers.The other great thing is that the book doesn't waste time. It only teaches the material that will be covered on the test, and it teaches the process of elimination techniques that you'll need to work through the test questions as fast as you'll need to.I'd strongly recommend this book over any other book out there."
2,Worst of the GMAT review options,"I order this book, the Kaplan 800 and the official GMAT review. This is by far the worst of the three titles. The strategies focus more on guessing than actually how to do the problems. Skip this book and try the official guide to GMAT review instead."
5,great advice for taking a CAT test,"This book covers the basic math and english content pretty well. I agree that if you are looking for real-math solutions to all the math problems you will need a different resource, but if you follow the testing advice in this book, you don't need to know all the advanced math to do very well on the GMAT.The Cracking book has a thorough description of, and strategy for dealing with, a Computer Adaptive Test (CAT test.) It lays out how to develop a pacing plan and set realistic goals, and offers a lot of great practice. I do still suggest using the Official Guide for additional practice, and also downloading the free CAT tests from GMAC.org for practice as well.I never got the sense that this book was supposed to be a replacement text for all the math you didn't learn (or forgot along the way) but rather a great guide to give you the test savvy that you need to ""crack"" this test."
5,Loads of good questions,Minor mistakes here and there but ultimately it gives you a good start to a fine practice.I managed to salvage a 720 for my GMAT so I guess this book deserves some credit.
3,"A good place to start, not finish","I purchased this book, along with the 3 official guides and the Kaplan two months prior to the Gmat exam. I found this book to be a good overview of the concepts tested on the Gmat. For someone like me who hasn't sat in a college classroom for half a decade it was really useful for re-familiarizing myself with concepts that I had forgotten.That being said, this book is in no way a substitute for the official Gmat prep books. The questions in the math review are far easier than what you will see on the Gmat if you are shooting for a 700+ score. After a few weeks of studying this book, you need to graduate to the official guides.My scores:Powerprep 1 (Official software) - 700 - no studyingPrinceton 1 - 630Kaplan 1 - 560Kaplan 2 - 600Kaplan 3 - 580Powerprep 2 - 730Actual Gmat - 750"
4,"Review for the GMAT book,","The book is very good, reason why i am very happy with my purchase. It's very useful because there are a lot of information about the GMAT test, what is good for international people who don't know anything about the test. In addition there is more information about web sites etc, to practise, get information and know more about it, get contact to talk to, apart of this book.The amazon service is wonderful. I really like it, and i am very happy with them. They offer any kind of product and facilities to buy or cancel the purchase, and to change your information needed to buy."
1,Cracking the GMAT 2010,"I was disappointed with the quality of the printing (and not the content of the book). Book has lot of pages with blob of ink all over it so apparently you cannot read these pages; half the book has very lightly printed pages. This book should have been rejected for the quality of its print, I expect Amazon to do a better job and would appreciate a refund!Thanks"
4,Great Study Tool for the GMAT,The book has been very helpful in studying for the GMAT and I would recommend it for people who need to review for the test. It has examples and practices tests that will help you prepare for the GMAT.
4,"Good prep, low quality paper",The book is great. Only the material is not that good... (newspaper one). There're other versions that come with pages w/ more quality.
4,Cracking the GMAT,"Very useful, easy-to-follow book. Could contain more practice questions, but generally OK. Recommend it, although I didn't take the test yet."
2,"Import or not, this is too expensive",Fifty bucks for 3 albums you can get for ten bucks each on their own. Do the math.
4,"Where Is ""Against All Odds"" ???",Wouldn't you think that song would be on one of these 3 albums? There was certainly enough space to place such a bonus song. It's only one of Phil's greatest platinum hits ever...
1,More for voyuers not photography lovers!,"I don't know about this book. I mean how much talent was involved in walking around a store with a hidden camera. There are perverts who do the same that get arrested and called sickos for it. Not worth your time, unless you want to see innocent old women changing there clothes."
2,Not good for beginners,"This Greek lexicon is not good for beginners. Greek words have many different forms (tense, mood, etc.), & the spelling can be different for different forms (sometimes even the beginning of a word changes). You must know the root spelling to look up a word in this lexicon. Few beginners know root spellings, so this is not the lexicon for students just beginning to learn Gree."
2,Epson Ink cartridge,"I received the black cartridge I'd ordered in a timely fashion and was impressed with the low price. However, I discovered the product had passed the expiration date. The supplier assured me the cartridge is good and asked that I give it a try, promising a replacement if it doesn't work. We'll see."
2,"""I Can't Make A Mistake"" by MC Lyte","Her newest single, ""I Can't Make A Mistake"" off of her album ""Seven and Seven"" is a poor effort on the artist's part. The song is a futuristic, bass-filled tune with a repetitive, weak hook/chorus. I wouldn't recommend buying the single or album. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of MC Lyte's past work. Check out the songs: ""Keep On Keepin' On"", ""Ruffneck"" and ""Cold Rock A Party(remix)"" all availible on past albums. Just look for my trademark name on other hip-hop, rap and R&B reviews in Amazon.com and you can trust that they're gonna be truthful and informative. ~Peace"
5,from laughing to shedding a tear...,"I found this book to be extremely enjoyable. So easy to relate to as a Mom and a Grandmom. I went from laughing to shedding a tear. So many humorous stories with a refreshing and down-to-earth appeal. It was not only great reading for relaxation and entertainment, but also had some thought provoking insights.I loved the wisdom learned from each encounter with the children and would recommend this book to all."
2,Another contribution to the noise floor,"The author put in something for everyone; alien abduction, alien T&A, God and Heaven, the solution to earth's problems, and totally benevolent aliens giving us everything for nothing. This book seems like a novel, designed to augment the author's retirement plan but not contributing much towards answering the big question."
3,A Storyline for Star Trek?,"I read the book in one sitting, enjoyed it but kept feeling like there was too much similarity to an unwritten Star Trek episode. I think it would be great if it were true. The author, having worked for the LA Times, gave it some initial credability (perhaps that should have made me more skeptical) but the more I read the more I kept getting a feeling that this was fabricated. Of course I'll have egg on my face if in a couple of years some ""famous"" people start fessing up to being ""taken"" and the new city appears in the desert. A good read non-the-less."
1,The Contact Has Begun,"Dear Reader,This book reads like a novel (a poorly written one at that), and is bogus from the word go. Although I do believe that contact began a long time ago, one must have a cosmological foundation that can comprehend multi-dimensional realities in order to get even a theoretical grasp of the ET phenomenon. This book was written tongue in cheek, from a purely 3rd dimensional point of view. It attempts to describe ""heaven"" as a physical place within a purely physical universe. This is the type of claptrap that continues to muddy the waters, and I believe that the author has done a disservice to him/herself, and the public at large by this display of pranksterism. The author's name speaks for itself."
2,He's pulling our UFO Mania-leg,"Mr.Krapf wins his bet with his LA Times friend. He being a skeptic bet that he could sucker all the UFO believers into buying his made-up story about an abduction. The Verdants (""Little green men""- Get it?) know where the ""Pearly Gates"" are and they are willing to share the knowledge if we are willing to buy Mr.Krapf's book(s) Surely we will be getting an update soon. A good joke on us!"
5,Read This Book With An Open Mind,"Dear Reader,I enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend it. I believe there are different extraterrestrial species out there besides the Verdants and they all have a different agenda. No one knows who is telling the truth these days so read this book with an open mind and remember it. This is one human among many who was contacted by extraterrestrials to prepare humankind for contact. If what he says is true ---and we will all know in 2002--- IT WILL BE ONE OF THE GREATEST EVENTS FOR HUMANKIND. Since the publication of his book, Phillip Krapf has written a 53,000-word document titled ""The Verdant Agenda: An Update"" that I also highly recommend.Peace,Tom"
1,I saw this story in Star Trek TNG Season 6,"This book mirrored an episode that I saw on Star Trek concerning first contact with a species. Once I saw the god and heaven stuff, I promptly closed it and it will be returned. I got suckered on this one. I do believe that people are being abducted (this was my first read on the subject). I hope to find a real book on this very interesting topic."
1,Contact or fiction?,I've read many descriptions of encounters with aliens. This one sounds like total fiction. Highly unbelievable. I would say - don't waste your money.Try some of Whitley Strieber's books if you want believable encounter information.
2,the contact has begun,"While reading this book I kept thinking back to my childhood days reading superman comics, etc. If what this man is passing off as truth why can't he give us some information that would be of the nature to inform with some substantiation. Why didn't he come back with a cure for cancer and all the other ills which befall mankind? This would be a great way to gain some credability. If you folks maintain any ""CONTACT"" with the author please ask him to do this on his next trip, OK?"
1,READS LIKE A COMIC BOOK!,"This book is enjoying reading but the author sounds like a child speaking or it's experiences. also there are some silly chapters in the book, like the female allien making sexually passes at the author,and the alliens having english names for the abductee.Or the tales of how much he liked allien ice cream and every thing was a heaven like state.there was also to many unbelivable details in the book,about the # of allien speices in the universe etc. ect. good book for a young person looking for a comic book."
2,Poor Contact,"This is a plodding, pedestrian, banal account of the author's supposedly true UFO contact experience. The story lacks wit, humor, charm and imagination. IMO it never happened and the author thought to have a laugh at the expense of people who did believe in UFOs, and make some money and pass his retirement time. The spelling is good."
1,This book is truly pathetic,"This book would have been OK as a lightweight piece of fiction.As a book on the subject of UFO's I wish there were a 'no star' rating for this. Krapf introduces an alien race called Verdants who, among other things will instantly turn a 60 square mile desert area of the Southwest into a verdant plain, where they will build a city, which will function as an Intergalactic capital for the Earth zone.Among the achievements of this race is finding Heaven and the ""Father"" in his heavenly kingdom, and, guess what? there are twelve pearly gates leading into this kingdom.This book deserves a 5* rating for infantile balderdash !!"
1,Not worth it.,Very excited to use my parts washer and ordered the flow through brush. Unfortunately the brush lasted two weeks before it started leaking out of the top of the bristle collar. Really bad quality.
3,SOLID ENTERTAINMENT FOR KIDS AND ADULTS! 3 1/2 STARS!,"Interesting coming of age film with the story centering around two friends who befriend an obese boy in a makeshift sideshow. The film is a cut above most juvenile fodder with some funny and interesting characters. Amanda Alch is a stand out as a pint sized southern bell! It's clean and short and the story isn't dumb-ed down, so adults can enjoy this film too. I caught this on cable, so I don't know what the DVD quality is."
5,Great Family Movie,Wonderful movie for families. Depicts prejudice in a small town and the lessons learned by a boy and his friends. Very well done. Our family thoroughly enjoyed it!
2,Somewhat Entertaining,"The people making this movie made a decision that it was more important to impart a moral than to be entertaining. That's unfortunate. In fact, that's my biggest complaint when it comes to ""family"" movies and movies aimed at kids. I think that a movie should be entertaining first and that any moral should flow naturally from the story, not be forcibly squeezed from it! That being said, this movie was for the most part pleasant and on the verge of actually being entertaining. The unnatural thing about this movie is how the characters decide that baptising Zachary Beaver is so overwhelmingly important. The whole baptism thing is sort of a non sequitur. The only saving grace here is that there was at least a small morsel of humor thrown in every now and then to keep the movie from getting disproportionally serious. In some ways this movie comes across more as a propaganda piece than as an actual attempt at honest entertainment."
4,Great way to purchase textbooks,This book arrived in the condition stated and in a timely manner. This was a great transaction.
3,"Curtis Turner, hero or ruffian?","While Turner's name is revered in the USA, it's a non-entity elsewhere, so it's easier for me to be objective. For an avid motor-racing fan it lacks insight and depth on the racing side, but there's a lot of research into the man. I can imagine he'd rub me up the wrong way as an overconfident careless larrikin, but get my admiration for his obvious courage and skill. The author lacks the story-telling knack that should enthrall and entertain, and believe me, Turner had a life full of retellable tales. Wish someone more entertaining wrote it. Dismissing the first ever ""car-in-swimming-pool"" feat in a few lines is a sin! These yarns could be spun out for hours!"
5,KEEPS YOU ROCKIN,"A very cool and rare cd to find in Canada, well at least where I live. I was amazed with this whole amazon page. this is the first cd I got from amazon and I was amazed I had 7-21 day international shipping and it arrived 3 days before it was expected. The cd arrived perfect and I listened to it and loved it so anyone who is reading this review should take my advise and if you love ICP Twiztid Kottonmouth kings you'll need to have this cd it is worth the moneyMCL FROM MY IGLOO IN CANADA EMAIL ME AT : WICKEDCLOWNZ@ALBERTA.COM"
5,Latin Music made in the US,"I am one of those people who love to buy random music because i listen to everything. But in this case I got introduced to Diestra after seeing them live in Miami by accident sometime in march of this year. Their music is a blend of latin roots, reggae, electronica and even rock. Diestra's music is melodic, beautiful, dark and at times agressive. It is FULL of passion!!!I really enjoy this cd and recomended to anyone who still enjoys true music in a time where things like N'SYNC rule the airwaves."
2,Man of torture-Hall of SHAME,"The life this man lived was disgusting not just in his ""private"" life but professional. Why is it he is so elevated?? So this sort of torture is ok on children?? How can you possibly trust the Psychiatry industry look at it's beginnings all the way to the present. Started with physical torture,bloodletting,cutting out organs, etc...and now the assault of drugging millions of people. WAKE UP people this is a total complete sham! A way they can not only make $$ but torture, and kill people while doing it. Wether this is intentional or not this is completely immoral."
3,Not as heavy as I hoped for.,This seems just liked the stool for lighter weight restrictions. It works but it was not as sturdy as I hoped it would be.
5,small shower solution,"My dad is 89 with a very small shower. This stool, with adjustable height on each leg makes it perfect for him to be able to sit and wash his feet safely, without fear of falling. So far, so good. Easy to assemble and adjust. Price was very reasonable."
3,work,"this item helps me in the shower because, I have problems standing. I would reccomend this item to everyone with back issues."
4,Sturdy stool,Stool appears to be sturdy and was easy to put together. It fits in my tub well and was glad to find a chair that would fit well.
3,"Sturdy, concept good","I can't give this a 5 star because the legs are not perfectly the same length! I wish they were. It will work and serve its purpose and I am glad to have it. I have a 'bench' but it doesn't fit into the tub sideways, so I had to straddle it the long way. This is its replacement and does well; it is called for 'smaller spaces.' My tub is larger than standard, but not a custom tub ... I am older and whereas I don't need the stool for my own showers (yet), I use it when I wash my dogs. Without it, washing the dogs kills my back. I sit on the stool in the tub, and the dog is in there too; I don't have to bend over or kneel over the side of the tub. SO, very thankful for this helpful 'tool.'"
5,Really good small footprint shower seat,"It's not easy to find a shower seat that will fit in an old narrow bath tub with overly rounded edges, but after much searching, buying and returning, this one won the prize. It has a small footprint that should fit in the smallest of tubs, it is durable and the rubber feet are heavy duty suction cups so it doesn't slide around in the tub. And the price on Amazon was about 40% less than the same thing is sold for in those catalogs that seem to inundate my mailbox.I highly recommend this shower seat when space is a premium. It was used for the duration of a total knee replacement recovery."
5,Great Product,Great product. Safe and sturdy. Perfect when you have trouble standing to take a shower or have trouble getting down into the tub.
4,On time,The shower tub stool came on time. It is a good product and works as it suppost too.Just have to attached the legs to the base.
5,Safe in Shower!,"My mother's shower stall is small. This fits right in the corner. She can sit, while I use the shower wand for her shower. It keeps her safe and makes showering for her so much easier. We both are very pleased."
3,"Good, but no screws!","Looks good, but impossible to assemble as the screws were missing. Had to return it (a hassle, but they can't send the screws, for some odd reason). Still, I reordered and hope the screws are included this time."
3,Bathtub stool,"For the bathtub stool which I purchased, the bathtub is not as roomy as I thought. But I am still happy I purchasedt it. Had reviewed some others before I settled on this one. To be honest, I have not used it yet. Had to wait till my out-of-town daughter came to visit me to screw the legs on. I thought the instructions called for additional washers which were not included, and as a 94-year old senior I was not able to go out to purchase them. My daughter who just screwed the legs on said the additional washers were not necessary."
4,Nice chair but......,Bought this for my Grandma. Nice chair but even at the lowest setting it does not go low enough to sit in the water while taking a bath. She uses it around her house but did not work out to help her in the bathroom.
3,Wrong screws included for assembly....,"Had to use extra washers to make the too long screws fit the bolting of seat to legs assembly. When I called the Duro-Med customer service people they said they couldn't send me just the right size screws, but I could return the whole thing. So just be aware you may get the wrong hardware size... seat works fine once I put it together. But so much for quality control coming from CHINA!!!"
5,Outstanding Tool,"I ordered one of these stools recently, and it is EXACTLY what I needed. My husband assembled it, and taking a tip from one of the other reviewers, used the automatic screwdriver function on his electric drill to make the screws nice and tight.It is steady, steady, steady. I had realized I was getting faint standing in the shower, and that is not only unpleasant, but dangerous. Now I'm not getting faint any more. This is a wonderful tool.It fits nicely in our small bathtub, and is easy to move around. After a shower I take it out of the tub to dry, and put it back in the next morning. It is not in the way in the middle of our small bathroom floor. It is just GREAT."
5,Sturdy and safe,Perfect for small spaces. Able to adjust legs to straddle bathtub so as to sit on and swing feet up and over tub. Used by 250+lb person and never felt unstable.
3,poorly designed enclosure,"this does not fit a yamaha rhino, too small, doors would not zip closed, be prepared to spend 100-200.00 to make it fit and useable. if you do modifications to it, this is a nice enclosure."
3,ok for the money but could be better,"I purchased this for my 08 rhino 700. The problem I have is the windshield clips under the hood and leaves gaps, and the hood won't completely latch. Also a huge air gap in the front corners of windshield area, you will need to fill that gap if you want to stay warm. The windshield its self leaves much to be desired, the plastic is wrinkled leaving you to look through wavy plastic.I thought about CAREFULLY taking a heat gun to the windshield to shrink and tighten for better visibility.Installation wasn't bad. Instructions were clear. My advice install in a warm environment, and let it stay for 24 hours after install.it uses sticky back velcro around the doors, if not cured correctly Velcro will not adhere to utvFor the money it's ok but could be much better."
4,Rhino cab cover,Went on with no problems. The doors do not fit on the top of my doors very well but I think I will be able fix it so it will keep the cold out. Keeps the cab wind free. The windshield distorts the view somewhat. Overall pleased with the enclosure.
3,Doesn't fit right,Nice enclosure well made but doesn't fit the the roll cage had to have two inches added on each side so the doors would zip. Should have a small patch of material added below the windshield between the body and roll bar to prevent cold air and rain from entering the cab.
2,Rhino Cab Enclosure,"Material great but enclosure would not fit My 2009 rhino 700. Length and width were at least 2""-3"" short. Also, the bottom of zip out doors were 3"" short of overlappingClassic Accessories QuadGear UTV Cab EncloSure (Hardwoods, Fits Yamaha)the top of the half doors. Spent at least 2 hours trying to fit it without success. Would not recommend it for a 2009 700."
1,"Right Blood, Wrong Book",I don't know who this book was written for. Racing fans? Sociology professors? Migrant workers? There are many good books about racing that have recently been published. This is not one of them. The book actually has very little to do with racing. It is an indictment of American industrialists. The premise is that very rich families engaged in dubious practices to get and stay rich. Sound interesting? It's not. At least not here.
1,"Definately not ""an engaging look behind the scenes""","Save your time and money. Unlike her first book about horse racing (""Down the Backstretch"", which is a passable sociological picture of the horse racing business), this one is mostly a pedantic recitation of mind-numbing, frequently-repeated details. It has all the charm and style of a statistics text."
1,The Sine Qua Non of Illiteracy,"The Right Blood, America's Aristocrats in Thoroughbred Racing, Carole Case; Rutgers University Press (2001)The sine qua non of illiteracy; infested with the same partisan stridency that corrupted the credibility of Ann Hagedorn's ""Savage Peace, Hope & Fear In America, 1919.""Pulped on December 24, 2010."
1,Disappointed almost every time I open it,"Sorry Authors but I can never seem to find what I am after here. e.g. Looking for info on ""aggregate"" terms - no reference to it. e.g. Looking for information on oracle date handling - not enough info to be useful.I need something more heavy duty really. Might be okay for someone starting out - but I doubt it."
1,"Over three weeks no book, no communication... Simply a Failed Business",I ordered a book from these guys on 8/12.. Wrote three times without a response.. and still no book. Simply failed business when you can't at least write back to your customers.
3,ok,nothing to write home about - book was in rough shape that's what is bad about about buying on line.
5,Amazing Show! 5 Stars all Day!,"Ok so first things first, my DVD arrived a day early which is awesome and all the DVD's inside the case were fully intact and work amazing. The case could have been better quality but that's something stupid to worry about. Secondly, I love the show, period. Honestly I never did watch the UK version so I have no basis for comparision nor do I want one. This show was real and raw, they told it like it was for the most part, I mean sure you have to embellish a little to keep the audience entertained but it really reminded me of my high school days which wasn't that long ago, class of 2008. But being a teen is very R-Rated and we all know that, parents I suppose just don't want to accept that and because of that this is the only season of U.S Skins and that really saddens me. Such a great show, gone so young :( RIP Skins U.S"
2,This definitely needs work.,"It's pretty obvious from the start of the first episode that this was not going to live up to the standard set by the UK version. Unlike The Office which very quickly turned into an almost completely different show compared to the Gervais/Merchant version, this one tries to pretty much be a carbon copy of the first simply with American references.If you have already seen the UK version, don't bother. You will be wasting your time and money on this one. If you haven't seen any seasons at all then this might be okay."
2,Dr Simons,"sadly, after having watched the UK version of Skins, swallowing the american version was a bitter pill. this is a watered down, vastly over-rated knock off, of the brit version. if you want to see the real Skins, untamed, and vastly watchable, buy the UK version. you will not be disappointed!"
3,makin'way for Oi!,"I think Slaughter & the Dogs really was the first among The Oi-bands. (Nonetheless, back in those days; '77 ; no one knew anything about the genre.in the beginning of the 80's when there was a sudden rise of the so-called Oi (nevermind-just a hype phrase invented by ****sucker Garry Bushell), I remember thinkin'""I've heard this before..."" First time back in''77 in Live at Roxy London, and the band was ....Sl & the dogs. once again (even back in those days) nothing new under the sun."
4,Not too horrific,"This book is not very scarey, in the usual sense of the word, but it does make you a bit wary of placing your hand in a dish washer or of letting people rent your house... I wouldn't mind turning into a tree sometimes though. It is an interesting book, but there are better ones for those really looking for a scare."
1,I did not like the book,"I read the book for English class. I thought the stories were not scary at all. In fact, they were a major waste of time to read."
5,The Next Smiths? Let's Hope So,"This has made it on to my top CDs of 1998. It's an excellent alterna-pop album, reminiscent of the Smiths in music, Chrissie Hynde/Primitives in vocals, and Morrissey in lyrics. Also contains one of the best one-line descriptions of modern rock in the late 90s--""It's a karaoke climate and we all sing the same ****ing song."" 'I Got the Wherewithal' was recently released as an EP in the States (backed with a few b-sides from British singles, including an acoustic ""A Pessimist Is Never Disappointed"" sung in French), but it pales in comparison to this wonderful import. Highly suggested. Let's hope Mercury releases this CD stateside soon."
1,Mis-leading product pictures,"We were surprised and disappointed to receive the product without the accompanying tank, especially since both pictures of the product display a tank. Nowhere does the description of the product state that it will be shipped without the tank."
1,Disappointed,Item came without power supply. Sold as network ready and came only with parallel port connection. No drivers supplied
4,Great 4 the basics. Want detailed plans? Go elsewhere.,"I want to know the basics...which birds use birdhouses, & what the basic dimensions for my targeted species are. What nesting materials do thew use...etc.. This book does a great job of doing that. I do NOT want my birdhouses to be clones of some boring plan out of a book. Get creative! Use this basic info & create your own unique backyard!Sorry previous writer was so disapointed, but he's right in one respect......if you want assorted detailed building plans...go elsewhere."
3,Just the basics,This book contains only one simple plan. It is a good book for novice woodworkers or bird watchers. However (like all books from the Stokes') the book is very interesting and easy to read. It provides a good foundation from which to learn the basics of bird house construction. More experienced woodworkers will be disappointed with this book and would be better served by purchasing a book of bird house plans.
