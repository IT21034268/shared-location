5,Just Had to say - it's that EXCELLENT!!!,"This is a debut album!!??! Like any classic, it gets better with time (i've played it just about every day for the past 2 mos. and have come to appreciate and admire it more and more). Where did these guys come from!!??!! I can't wait to hear their next project. A must for anyone who loves good, hard-hitting rock; for those who shy away from the heavier stuff - DON'T! - the ones on this cd are gonna grab you, push you over the edge, and leave you thirsting for more. While the lighter, melodic tunes keep you singing and bumping to their beat, the masterfully written and performed acoustic piece - well, you just have to hear that one for yourself. Amidst this incredible array of musical genius, you have lyrics power enough to lift you from the gutter of despair to heights only imagined. Do I like this cd? Thanks Edify for not only not wasting our hard earned money, but also using your talents to promote growth amidst the decay occasioned by much bad rock."
1,Did not fit the iPod,"The case appears cheaply made and kept slipping off the iPod at the top, so the screen would not have been protected. I confirmed with the seller that I had received the correct size for the thicker 60GB/80GB iPod because the case seemed too small. Also, the ""3pcs Screen Protector"" seems to mean the one protector you receive is cut into three pieces so you can still move the controller on the front. Either that, or the seller didn't understand that the plastic protector has thin covers over it that you are supposed to peel off so it sticks to the iPod. The seller was helpful, but now I have the hassle of printing out their return authorization, going to the post office, and paying for postage to send it back for an item that only cost $15 in the first place. I went to an Apple store and am much happier with the Marware cover I found there. It is much better quality, and actually fits."
1,Do not order this!,This is not an assortment as the description states! This is ONE item and the company will not pay return shipping even thought their description is a lie.
5,"Couldn't find this belt anywhere else, Thanks Amazon","I had a special application and needed two Dayco BP88 Belts so they could work in balance and under the same tension. These belts were just what I needed. Dayco Belts are good V-Belts, I would recommend them for heavey duty use."
2,Mealy and tastes like corn,"I made this cake for my birthday yesterday and was disappointed. I have eaten gluten-free cakes which taste no different than cake made from wheat flour, so I know it can be done. This cake texture is mealy, the cake is dense and tastes like corn. Not like cake should taste. With butter-cream frosting, it was edible, but I will not make it again. I'm still searching for the perfect GF cake mix."
4,"sweet muffins, works egg-free!","We're picky about our gluten-free baked goods, especially since we can't use eggs. This mix was very successful without eggs, baked as muffins. The flavor is like a sweet cornbread, but lighter in texture. And it's wonderful with a quick lemon glaze ...and better yet with fresh berries. I suspect it will make an excellent strawberry shortcake, too.Note: I used a variety of egg replacer for 2 eggs, plus a bit extra Ener-G egg replacer, used milk instead of water, tossed in 2 Tb nonfat dry milk for extra yum/protein. Baked at suggested temperature, 25 minutes."
1,Don't go here...,"I bought this hoping for at least an edible product. After following the directions to the ""T"" I ended up with a flat, soggy cake that I threw out after just a taste. And, this is not an inexpensive product. No matter how much you want to eat cake, pass on this product."
4,blood moon the curse,this book is exalint but you need all three and thank the lord for amazon cos its out of print and i cant get it in new zealand
4,Enjoyable,"Disc one was pretty cool; it's basically a documentary about the band. I had no idea that they went through so many line-up changes in the early years. Disc two is live footage, which was good. These guys tour all the time. Their manager actually had to pull them off the road so that they wouldn't burn out. Disc 3 was videos and stuff (meh, whatever). Any hard-core AILD fan will enjoy this. The sound and video quality of the live footage is really good.Recommended."
1,Avoid like the plague,"The first episode, ""madman's paradise"", is supposed to show Grimlock being a hero? As usual the big Dinobot stumbles around creating chaos in a worthless episode, though it did do a tiny bit of character developement for Daniel. It would have been better to have ""Call of the Primitives"" instead.""Grimlock's new Brain"", atleast Grimlock is a hero in this episode. Basically the only reason to watch this episode and buy the tape is to see the Technobots for the first time. I can only recommend this episode is if you want to complete your Kid Rhino collection or if you can only get ""The Return of Optimus Prime"" in a three set."
3,not quite what i expected,"if you'r a Joan Sutherland lifetime fan such as myself, then, yes buy this dvd otherwise mgive it a miss"
5,Absolutely spectacular...Easy 10 star!,"This is the one to get. This is La Stupenda's greatest roles recorded in her absolute prime - which is to say, this is as good as singing could get. If you want to hear the possibilities of the human voice, this is it. The very best."
3,They should have developed the story.,"It's an interesting story, but they did not develop it, in my opinion. They did not deepen into the characters lives so that we really do not care about what happens or not to them."
3,timex watch,I do like the speed distance aspect of the watch. But unlike other training watches you can't store old workouts in it and the lap feature does not tell you how fast each lap was until you are done. Needs some work.
2,Nothing special,"I started watching this series because it sounded so good, but it was so boring. I think one of the main problems was that I couldn't get into the characters. The only character I liked was Larva. He was so pretty when he took off his mask..why would you cover up such beauty? It seemed as if the story would get better, but I do not want to bore myself with every episode just to find out it doesn't get better. If you like the characters...this may be a good series. :)"
4,Much Improved,"As disappointed as I was in the first DVD, I was very surprised at the level of improvement in the second. Pretty much all of my complaints about the cutting of the openings and closings, and the lack of indexed scenes were taken care of. In fact there was even additional bonus material! While the TV series does not compare in quality and beauty to the OVA's, the story is still very interesting, and this DVD has been produced in a way that does justice to the series and its fans. I hope those who were as disappointed as I was a the treatment of the first, give the series another chance."
2,Old Thinking,"I am a former Title I teacher and reading specialist. I am currently teaching third grade in an excellent school district. I am always reading the current literature and keeping up to date with data driven best practices. I purchased this book after the great reviews from others. Wow, am I disappointed in the content of this book. Granted, it was written in 1993 and is outdated. Thank goodness that those of us who graduated from school within the past 7-8 years are not using these methods that are so outdated. For all those parents looking for information on how to teach your child to read, this is not the book for you. My suggestion would be to focus on decoding and work attack skills. Please keep in the back of your mind that statistically speaking, approximately 10%-15% of children will struggle with reading. Some studies cite even a higher percentage."
5,fold and mail stationery all the way,"Super fun, colourful areogrammes.Contains 40 Sheets, 4 different patterns (mod-vespas, pop art, space-age lounge, 60's sounds). An alternative and fun way to send mail.an official bon bon product.http://www.yumpop.com/cute/index.cfm"
1,A Chore to Read!,"This book is so poorly written it isn't worth even the bargain book bin and it was obvious to me, since the author used as a cover for the book a picture taken by someone else that she probably got off the internet of Clay in concert that she has no original thought. Shame on this author for intruding on Clay Aiken's family life. It is VERY obvious that she was using Clay Aiken to pull in his fans to buy this piece of literary junk and that is exactly what it is. Now she excersizes her freedom of speech by writing this trash and tell falsehoods, just another person making a buck out of what she calls a book off Clay Aiken's back. A tribute indeed. She may call it that to get people to buy it and the fool I am that I did, probably one of the few sales she had. This book stinks! And it stinks of opportunism!"
1,Outrageous,"This person is beyond outrageous. She writes an unauthorized book about someone she is a ""fan"" of, and then sues him for not publicizing her terrible, boring effort. Anyone buying this book, you deserve what you get."
1,DISGUSTING,"This ""author"" has obviously had all her relatives (she probably doesn't have friends) review this ugly little book, which is the ONLY way it could get 5 stars. She should be hiding in shame. When her ""book"" didn't make the fortune she anticipated, she has decided to sue Clay Aiken and his mother. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Buy Learning to Sing, written by Clay Aiken and worth reading over and over."
1,A Waste of you reading time,"I did buy this book here, read a few chapters and was totally repulsed by the authors bragging about how she consistantly used Clay fans to get free trips to concerts and a free place to stay. Not to mention a free trip to Hawaii with room and board.Book was written as if by a forth grader in it's quality of writing, and exploitive to say the least. Only made it about a third of the way through and tossed it aside. First book I've ever read where I really felt the author owed me back my money!"
5,A Great Read,I loved this book! I enjoyed Jeannie's style of writing and her sense of humor. It really is a tribute to Clay Aiken's fans. The stories are touching and presented in a loving and sincere manner. I recommend it highly!
1,What a louse,"Yeah, she loves him so much she wrote a book about HIM without permission and is now suing him, his mother, and a bunch of others because they did not support her attempt to profit off of him. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU REALLY DO CARE ABOUT CLAY."
1,BORING BOOK -- DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"The most interesting aspect of this BORING book was counting the grammatical errors. Even the hard core Clay fans would have a hard time staying awake with the dragging, boring accounts of Clay fandom as told by another so-called ""fan"" who has met Clay on only a couple of occasions in her life. Snoozefest."
1,I hate that they have this bundled with his new CD,"In my opinion, the author is an opportunist of the worst kind. I received soliciting emails asking for my ""Clay stories"" and then asking for prayers as she went to Faye and the family to get their blessing for publishing the book. Which she obviously didn't get. (The family's blessing or my prayers) How about making your own way in the world instead of on someone else's back? And, have you noticed that those who really are in Clay's inner circle, including friends from high school and college are incredibly tight lipped about sharing any information to any media? I regard that has a measure of the content of their character. Sadly, something lacking in this author."
1,Not worth the money,I have had this book for several months and have not been able to get into the book although I have picked it up many times... This author toots her own horn at every turn and even tho the info about Clay seems to be as reported in other books I feel that it is a book that I will never finish and have wasted my money... If I could get a refund I probably would
1,Poorly Written Book That Smacks of Opportunism,"I bought a used copy of this book from another source, and I did actually read it...or should I say, TRIED to read it. It is poorly written in an amateurish style and, if the author used a proofreader or editor, it doesn't seem evident. After awhile I just skimmed through the book because it was unbearably tedious to read. The photos in the book are of poor quality.Also there is something about the tone of this book that smacks of being opportunistic. The author clearly seems to relish basking in the reflected glory of a hometown celebrity. That made it uncomfortable to read. Sorry, but I can't recommend this book."
1,I'd give it 'no stars' if I could...,"This book is nothing more than a person trying to capitalize on 15 minutes of fame at someone else's expense. There is no way I would recommend this to any fan of Clay's, nor would any TRUE fan read it.As to the author who is 'allegedly' a TRUE family friend and fan, she sure has a funny way of showing it. I know that I personally don't make it a habit of suing friends and those I am a fan of.....If you want to know about Clay's life as a child, read his ""Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music In Your Life"". If you want to read charming tales of fan encounters, visit any fan message board, where any number of heartwarming, funny, wonderful fan encounters can be found.Don't waste your time or money on this."
1,She doesnt know Clay and Faye,"This person does not, to my knowledge, know Clay or Faye.If she did it was when Clay was a baby. She needs to get a life. She claims to be a clay fan. Yeah, whatever. A clay fan wouldnt try and make money off of Clay.How dare anyone write a book without Clay Aikens permission about him. I think this is an absolute disgrace. I hope her sales are poor and no one buys this book.BTW: I am still so angry with this little MS. Holleman. Who does she think she is doing this. Just another WAY to make money off of Clay. Geez. What a sleazeball.I have told everyone I know NOT to buy this book. They will pass the information on.I cannot believe she has the nerve to take Clay Aiken to court. He should be taking her to court for writing a book without his permission.This person sounds looney. she has the nerve to sue him just as his sophmore CD is about to come out and that shows she is callaous and wants to hurt his careerShe is a liar..Thats all."
1,Don't be conned,"this opportunist has sold illegal DVDs, illegal photos, illegally burned demo CDs on eBay, and conned a fan club out of an all expense paid trip to Hawaii--most of the fans have known for years what a flake she is. Outrageous what's she's doing!!!"
1,Can't believe I bought this book!,"I actually used a birthday gift certificate to buy this book because it was linked to my ""account"" as ""something I would like"" by Amazon. Imagine my surprise to read a few days after I got it in the mail that the author was suing Clay! I do not recommend this book. If you are interested in personal stories about Clay and his fans, why not read his ""Learning to Sing"" and join an online fan community? This book is poorly written but could be viewed as a simple, fangirly collection of tales which was published by a ""vanity press"". There is certainly nothing wrong with being a fangirl! But now it has been revealed as just an attempt to make money off of a celebrity and to appear ""important"" to his fans by using a nebulous ""connection"" to his extended family. It almost never ends well when someone wants to be ""paid"" for their ""love""!"
1,Forgot I was reading it...,"Just remembered I'd bought and started this book. Found it was so uninteresting that I dropped reading it and forgot I had it. Repetitive and self-serving, if anything."
4,Before you quit your Job,I like the book. It has come at a time am mapping out my exit strategies from my formal employment. It was good value for money and a must - buy for all those contemplating to start off as entrepreneurs.
5,Rich Dad's Before You Quit Your Job,Excellent book which brings you to the next level of the entreprenuer way of thinking. Being an entreprenuer is a state of mind and once again the Rich Dad Company brings knowledge and experience to the novice investor or business person.
4,Strengthen my belief,"I have never read any of his other books. I came across this book at a book store and it caught my attention because I recently quit my job trying to start my own business. I completely agree to what he had to say, and I think he really strengthened my belief and motivated me in moving forward with my business plan. It was a very easy read, and I am motivated to check out his cashflow101 game. I thought the book sounded a bit cheesey in the first few chapters, because it seems like it was trying to sell the other books that they wrote earlier. But towards the end, it does have very good advise and powerful recommendations."
5,Quick Shipment,Ordered this book for a summer college course I'm taking and was shipped quickly. Great price for a used book.
3,Another Rehash Robert?,"I will preface this with the fact that I skimmed through the book when I was at the bookstore. However, I came to the same conclusion that other reviewers have of Kiyosaki's last few books: He just rehashes the tenants of ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" over and over.I would flip randomly at a page and read a few paragraphs and swear I was reading ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"". Things like ""Don't Work for Money"", ""Become and Entrepreneur"", etc. And he went into the different types of thinking...i.e. Cash Flow Quadrant rehash.Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Kiyosaki and enjoy his message. I even met him in person one time and it was great. But is this what his ""business"" is? Just reselling millions of Americans on the hope that his books will help them? Other than his book/game empire, what is Kiyosaki's major business?? Anyways, just my two cents."
2,"Skip the book, it's all about buying the game!","I have read some of his other books and they all are a sales pitch for his game but I must say, this one it was over the top sales. In his past books I didn't find the sales pitch so in your face. I still think it has some insperational properties if you can look past the sales pitch but they didn't make that easy to do."
3,Good Reminder,"The book has some good reminders about things to think about when jumping into the world of entrepreneurism. I did like some of his analogies. For example, he talks about how he took a racecar driving class and describes how the driving rules for driving on a racetrack are completely different than the rules of the road for your regular neighborhood street. The things you do in a racecar would get you killed on a regular street and vice-versa. He compares this to being an employee as compared to an entrepreneur and how a whole different set of rules apply. I found that interesting and a great analogy."
1,do not buy this video!!!!,"Rain and The Strange Love of Martha Ivers are two of the best movies I've ever seen. Director Lewis Milestone does an amazing job in both of them, their stars - Joan Crawford, Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin, Lizabeth Scott - are at their very best, the storylines are outstanding... BUT PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY A DECENT COPY OF THESE MOVIES!!! THIS TAPE STINKS!! It's missing more than 20 minutes of story in Rain, and you can't barely see Martha Ivers - the image quality is AWFUL! Buy the restored version of Rain on DVD (complete and with WAY better image and sound quality) and some other copy of Martha Ivers - so you'll be able to fully appreciate these gems."
1,His juvenile fiction is far more mature and edifying,"Heinlein is one of my all-time favorite authors, and perhaps the best science-fiction writer ever, but I thoroughly disliked this story. Part of my displeasure is very subjective: I am a sincere Christian and kept reading only in the hope that Heinlein would resolve the blasphemous story line in a settling manner, but it only got worse and worse. Part of my displeasure is more objective, however: the story is a juvenile fantasy of free sex and freedom from consequences that I find ridiculous and, especially after reading so much of his genuinely edifying juvenile fiction, frankly disappointing."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"More Heinlein drek from the era of his that you Just Should Not Read. This book, however, does have one or two amusing bits in there, but not enough overall to save it, or make it worthwhile, I think. Travelling around, bits about god, all that sort of thing. Not sure if it is supposed to be Twainish, or what."
2,Confusing,I read this book for an English Study unit. I enjoyed this book a lot but found the ending quite confusing. When Jerry explains to alex what has been happening to him
1,Not as good as the others,"This was the last Heinlein book I read. This book, together with ""The cat that walked through walls"", convinced me that Heinlein had lost it. Clearly it was more fun to justify a lifestyle than write real fiction. Some things don't improve with age."
3,RAMBLING SHAMBLING MESS,I'm an old time Heinlein fan. But this story was hard to get into. It focuses more on preaching to the reader than entertaining the reader. I don't understand its prior status as an NYT best seller. Not one of Heinlein's better works.
2,I missed it or it missed me!,"I have never read Heinlein or any science fiction for that matter. I picked up the book for a new experience - an experience that was flat. My criticism, however, might be misguided from all the positive reviews by people, I suspect, are more into the genre than I am. A great help, however, at midpoint in the book, to read a biography of the author. Then I could start to see themes of his philosophy emerge. The irrationality of religion, the jabs at all sorts of denominations, the odd relationships between people, and the fact that true love conquers all started to become clear. Getting to those points seemed to be a chore. Instead of enjoying the experience, I found myself confused and impatient with the way the reader is jerked around - but then, that may be the point."
3,Enjoyable Read,"This is the first book I've read by Heinlein. After reading the reviews of other folks, it appears that this piece wasn't a very good representation of ""classic"" Heinlein. Not having been endowed with possible genre bias, I can say that I enjoyed reading this book. The ending wasn't very satisfying and Heinlein's Christian straw-man was a bit narrow, but I can understand what he was shooting for and I never found myself bored with the narrative.You may not come to Heinlein's conclusions, but the fact that it makes you really think about often hard-held beliefs is a tribute to the book."
5,Caught off Guard,"Absolutely surprised during the last few chapters of the novel. Had no idea the storyline was heading the direction in which it all came together. ""Amazing"", one (if not the most) interest holding novels....also thought envoking towards the ""Devine Trinity"", etc. ad nausium."
4,Great RAH book,"This book was really funny and filled with irony. Anyone who attends church of any kind regularly should find it entertaining, but not too blasphemous or offensive. Just when the world changing stuff started to get old, with a trump, shout, tornado and rapture the whole story changed."
3,Heinlein vs. Cabell,"I liked the book, until I found James B. Cabell's ""Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice"" (written in 1919) to be much better. Check out Cabell's book! I think it's even available in electronic format."
5,Best Heinlein Book,This book is one of the five best books I have ever read. It changed the way I look at life.
4,The Modern Book of Job,"This is the only RAH book I have read. That is not to say that I have'nt tried to read His others, they just don't seem to hit that grand slam that this one does. {Personally I don't think that RAH wrote this book)(It's too good)Job is a classic.......Start off with the Old Testament version, add a dollup of Orwells, 1984, Throw in a whole lot of Piers Anthonys, Incarnations of Immortality, and just for the hell of it...No pun intended, drizzle in a little Hitchikers guide to the Galaxy. And there you have it. It's a good, fast, fun read that if you have an imagination and an open mind, it will make you think, and possibly have a more humurous outlook on this thing we call life. And also be a little more tolerant of others beliefs"
2,Not a comedy of justice or any other,"While Heinlein has many hits, this one is a miss for me. While the premise of the first two-thirds of the book is promising, it gets old in a hurry. The last third is a little better, but not much. I guess it is somewhat telling when the book gets better when the protagonist dies, or at least leaves this earth. Not my cup of tea."
5,A Wild Satire,"This book pleasantly surprised me. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't the deliciously wild satire I got. The book started out as a fairly typical (though thoroughly enjoyable) Heinlein ""stranger in a strange land"" story. But then, about half-way through, the book took on a completely unexpected twist, I for one had no idea the book was going the direction it took. The book was very good and it kept me glued to my seat. Outside of The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress, which most consider Heinlein's peak, I'd call this the very best of RAH's post-Stranger fiction.The novel, being a satire at heart, has some seemingly very deep themes in it, it focuses heavily on religious aspects and is somewhat irrevant. The many underlying themes have their meanings that I think we can each take in our own personal way, though what Heinlein's actual intended message was is anyone's guess. Read it and judge for yourself."
3,"Great, but not his best","I love Robert A. Heinlein's quriky brand of libertarian sci-fi, and I enjoyed this book. However, it didn't compare to some of his other work like ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,"" a real sci-fi classic. This book is more psychedelic and postmodern. It centers around a conservative protestant minister who's life is turned upside down when, after walking through fire while on vacation, he find himself in another world that is just slightly different than his own. Every time he gets a little used to it, the world changes again and he has to start from scratch. The religious irreverence and social commentary that ensue are fun, but after the fifth world or so I was getting a little bored, and wishing the inevitable would just happen already. Still, a good read, and I would recommend it, just not as an introduction to Heinlein."
4,Marvelous satire,"This is top notch Heinlein, doing the social critique/satire he does best. Reverend Alexander Hergensheimer, citizen of the apparently Christian Reconstructionist influenced United States of North America, awakes from a fire walk to find himself being transported from parallel universe to parallel universe with his lovely Danish concubine Margrethe.While this doesn't replace Strarship Troopers as my favorite RAH, it does equal Stranger in a Strange Land. This is an excellent satire and parody of Christian teachings. I loved the portion where Hergensheimer volunteers to go to hell. Reminded me of Machiavelli's advice that one would encounter beggars and nuns in heaven but popes, kings and princes in hell. While this book didn't convince me to leave the Catholic Church (I already have) I see where it could knock wavering Christians off the fence."
4,"Great book, little weird. Very interesting views.","Throughout my experience in reading Heinlein I have discovered his bizaar views on religion. His views on women and sex. This book was very exciting and there weren't very many boring or slow reading parts. The thing that captured me the most from this book was Heinlein's Views of Heaven Vs Hell. If you have not read this book yet, you must do so."
4,Melodic and Memorable,"Richard Souther is not a newcomer to the light jazz arena. This is his best: it's breezy but not frothy, melodic and very memorable. A wonderful addition to any devotee's collection of electronically-enhanced schmooz. ""Your Gentle Manner"" is a sublime example: a song permeated with conviction and unusual depth."
3,Lovely character study.,"Clearly, this is what is meant by 'literary fiction.' The main character in this first novel, Sally Burke, is lovingly drawn and totally convcing. That's important because the author of course is a man. (Now that brings up an interesting question. How would I know if the character is totally convincing as a female since I too am a male. Oh well, let's move on.) If you love to read and want to get totally drawn into someone else's life (don't we all), you'll love this book. But if it's plot you're looking for, look elsewhere. This book mirrors real life. It goes from episode to episode with none wrapping up too neatly or too compelling. Sally is a lot like you and me, I think. Not as successful a book as ""Starting Out in the Evening"" but worth a read. Looking forward to this writer's third novel."
5,The Best Extra Strength Remedy,"This aspirin is THE BEST for those of us afflicted with brain crushing headaches. Sadly, Bayer has apparently discontinued making them. First they disappeared from store shelves, and now you can't even get them on Amazon, I'm left buying Bayer Advanced, which is next best but not THE best."
4,Great but for two exceptions....,"The GOSFORD PARK soundtrack is a mostly delicious recording, highlighted by Jeremy Northam's beautifully rendered versions of Ivor Novello's song. But, what on earth are those two awful songs sung by Abigail Doyle in her unattractive, breathy voice?Her diction is so poor that the lyrics are barely distinguishable; in fact, our friends have a party game in which the prize goes to whomever can decipher the final lines of""Only For A While"" - and no-one has yet been able to figure it out. If anyone knows what the heck she is saying, please tell...Otherwise, this album is a joy and highly recommended."
5,Brings you back to the movie everytime,"If I had one complaint, only that it isn't long enough for my liking!! I love the period music in this film as much as I loved the movie itself. I've watched the DVD to death literally. There is something about this score that makes listening to it anytime a relaxing and enjoyable experience. I love having it on while playing Majhong on a weekend afternoon. Arrived factory sealed and I only wish I had ordered this sooner because suppliers seem limited. Maybe I should get another one just in case? Highly recommend."
4,Question: Does this have the libretto?,"Could someone please answer this question with a comment below this review? Does this re-issue have the libretto? The original London/Decca issue from the mid-1980s has a massive 200-page book that includes essays and the libretto, and I don't know how the company has treated the reissue."
4,As cheap as it is cheap,"You get what you would expect for the price. Mine came with a marble broken in half. One of the black marbles came with the mirror finish rubbed off so it's dull and rough. The marbles are not smooth--they have ripples and ridges. But, if you already have the board and just need the marbles, they are perfectly adequate. If you are looking for a showpiece game set, spend more for the nicer marbles."
5,like having dessert,"This tea has so much vanilla & maple flavor, it's like having dessert. Bet 'cha can't drink just one!"
3,ready for the world,the cd case was cracked and had some scratches on the cd itself but it played fine
5,I love Ready for the World!! But there will always be haters,"I have always been a fan of Ready for the World from the start. Every song was a hit for me. My favorite was ""love you down, Whose is it, tonight and so many more."" I just hate to hear haters like the review before me of Mike Patterson. There are several artist that may sound like someone else or have similar lyrics.....but in the music business it comes down to who gets the break and who doesn't. Well, I have never heard of Mike Patterson and probably never will. Ready for the World had their fame and they could be back you never know. JUST QUIT HATING.........Lay back and enjoy the music - cause you know its good."
2,Not very flavorful,Wouldn't buy this flavor again. Made 10lbs of venison jerky with it and the jerky lacked flavor. I'll try another flavor next time.
3,Needs More,Had used the Regular Jerky seasoning before and liked it. I thought the Bourbon BBQ would be a nice change. Product does not have much flavor (bourbon or bbq)- end up with mild jerky flavor with a slight hint of tomato at the end. Next time I use this I will add some sweet baby ray's bbq sauce to the mix and maybe a shot of bourbon.
2,Home Movie from Mr Brass,"In the main concerns somebody, in this case a young lady, wandering around London in the 60's, being encouraged by an amatuer film maker to wander in and out of some off-beat situations, mixing this an interested gentleman.Together with this, a varied collection of poor quality stock footage from earlier days including war and public rioting to do with war.A very strange and not particularly entertaining offering from Mr Brass."
1,Crackpot Pseudoscience,"James Hogan wrote in 2005, ""Once you've got a shop window to the world that people are coming to look at, you find all kinds of thoughts, opinions, and ""takes"" on various issues that you just have to air. But at least it's better to vent them in a place that anyone interested can choose to visit, than to insist on bogging your books down and turning them into pulpits, with the consequences that we've all seen and groaned at."" Five years and some Crackpot Pseudo-scientific ideas later he does exactly that. Buried under the Dingbattery there are some good stories. On a whole its not worth the effort."
4,Poorly organized but still a frightening story,"I had a hard time following the minutiae of the book (publishing deadline, maybe?) but the big elements were awful enough. I can't imagine the terror those women and his entourage (how and where did he find them, anyway?) felt on a day-to-day basis. I recall a woman who said of battered women, ""He has to sleep sometime,"" but in this case, even that wasn't true. I found one particular incident so disturbing that I decided not to keep the book in my house after completion (stored it in the garage until the library book sale), specifically his favorite method of animal torture.The most frightening thing is that other people like him exist, and we haven't found them out yet."
5,Author proves herself,"This author is turning into our next Ann Rule, if not better. She has proved with ""Stalked"" ""Precious Angels"" and now ""Suffer the Little Children"" what an outstanding true crime writer she is. Suffer is another outstanding work of art and mastery of story telling from a lady who knows exactly how to do it!!!"
1,Save yourself,"This book was badly written, badly research, and doesn't even appear to have been edited for spelling/grammar mistakes. The writing is confusing because the author jumps around in time and then doesn't explain who people are in relation to the story. They just show up and then are gone. The research is obviously done be a bias person who is only interested in relating horrible facts, not actually proven events. It's a sad story that deserves to be properly portrayed. This book isn't that story. Save yourself the time of trying to read it."
1,confusing as all get out,"as the story proceeds, the facts change and change again. the reader has to go back over copy just to confirm that indeed the 'fact' has changed. aside from that, i found it impossible to believe that police would arrest a man with a woman in the car, at night on a deserted road and take the man to jail leaving the woman to walk home. come on!"
3,A Monster & Angel in the Family!,"Jesse James Cummings has two wives but I thought it was one wife and a girlfriend. Anyway, his true intentions are with this young niece, Melissa Moody. He kills her mother Judy Ann Mayo Moody who was also his own sister and later tortures, rapes, and kills his niece leaving her in the woods. It's one of the worst crimes in the midwest in recent memory. Jesse James Cummings is truly one of the most sadistic, cruel killers especially the treatment of his own niece. My heart goes out to the victim's family which is also his family. Ironically that the same family can produce a wonderful child like Melissa can also create a monster."
3,Good book... horrible writing,"More than once I was forced to stop reading and set the book down, not because of the graphic depiction of real life events but because of the horrible writing. While a good effort, the paragraph and sentance structure made the book almost unreadable."
5,the church is right!,"Amy Welborn has done a tremendous job presenting the Catholic faith as it actually is - the complete Truth of God. The book reads easily, very well done. Every Christian should read it."
3,Prove It Church,"The first page I read sounded VERY interesting and I bought the book specifically for a 6th grader based on that. However the remainder of the book did not continue the story I had read on the first page. That was disappointing. The rest of the book provides basis for addressing questions. Not as entertaining as I had hoped and not an easy enough read to hold the interest of a 6th grader. I'll finish reading it, but I don't think I can convince my 6th grader to read it."
4,Good Synopsis of the Season,"This video sums up the 1998 season quite nicely. You know a video is good when it makes a touchdownless game(Miami's 12-9 win over New England) seem exciting. The drama on the sidelines and in the lockeroom is displayed in an exciting manner. And how 'bout that list second hit on Doug Flutie causing the fumble that sealed the playoff win over Bufallo. Whereas the season ended on a big time downer in Denver, this should somehow have been mentioned in the video. None the less the highlights of Dan Marino, Zack Thomas, Oronde Gasden, Olindo Mare, and others should bruighten up the screen for any Dolphins fans out there."
5,Beverly Sills at 50,"If one reads history, Violetta (a Courtesan) was much older than Alfredo, which was very common during those times. Although Beverly Sills was 50 at this time, her age has nothing to do with her ablility to sing the score and portray a very convincing Violetta. She also in her career has sung this opera on stage more than 250 times, that in itself is a great achievment, to which Callas couldn't even claim.This was one of the greatest singing actress's of our time, and deserves to be a part of anyone's operatic collection."
2,"great idea, bad customer service","Ok love the TV. But it broke...10 days before the warranty was up. So I followed all the return instructions and sent my $4 or 6 bucks for return shipping and that was 4 months ago...I have YET to receive my replacement, a return phone call or a return email. This is the WORST customer service on the planet and apparently they aren't very interesting in making a good product. Like another review, I think the picture tube blew on mine. When it worked, it was fabulous, and one of the only small color TVs I could find with these features. I wish another brand would do this...and back the product!!"
1,TV Freak,This TV is not portable at all. It needs to be plugged into an outside cable or an additional antenna to work. The antenna that is attached to the TV only works for the radio. I wanted a small TV to take to work to watch football on Sunday. I either have to carry this TV with an additional plug-in antenna---how portable is that---or carry my little B&W set. I would not buy this product.
1,Would not buy,I was never happy with this product. The picture always had a green tint and would not adjust out. After less than a year the tube blew out.
1,"Coby CTV555 5"" COLOR TV","Coby CTV555 5"" COLOR TV is unquestionably the cheapest, worst designed, poorly manufactured, unsatisfiying product that I have ever purchased anywhere. I read the instructions plugged it in and it did not work. This was a complete waste of time. Amazon ought to drop this product."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"I received a Coby CTV-555 as a present a year ago. The first one was DOA. So, I got a replacement. It worked, but I needed cable as I could only get one station. So, I didn't use it for several months. We got cable, and this useless machine worked all of 5 times - just long enough to get over the 90 day warranty. No picture - looks as if the picture tube has blown. This is a buyer beware . Don't buy it at any cost. Coby should be ashamed to put out a product like this to scam the customer. No wonder they only give a 90 day warranty. They know if won't last any longer. Minus 1 star is the rating I would give this."
3,"Honey, I shrunk Los Van Van.","Digo esto porque este grupo toca no necesariamente igual que la orquesta legendaria, pero porque tocan un estilo de Charanga progresiva, si con ocho musicos.En este estilo de Charanga progresiva estan por ejemplo un tema ""reggea son"", y otro ""merengue haitiano son"". En mi opinion el grupo esta en su mejor sonido cuando el Violinista toca mas estilo Charanga y la percusion se pone agresiva.Se lo recomendaria para fanaticos de grupos como Los Van Van, Alfredo de la Fe, y otros que busquen algo distinto.A mi me gusto, pero no me fascino."
2,Not what you would expect,"I thought the reviews for the other buyer were accurate, but after installing the product, I find the picture to be less than useful. Most of the time, the lighting has to be in perfect condition in order for the picture to come out clearly. When I install in on my front porch, I could not make out the picture of any visitors that came to my house with my porch light on. Useful only during the day time with light out."
5,Well made faucet,I purchased this to be used with the filter system that originally came with a plastic faucet.It works great and looks nice.
4,Good quality,"Good quality faucet. It did require a little 'extra' plumbing on my part, but not because of the faucet. I installed it in a manufactured home, and the existing plumbing is not what would be considered 'standard'. But it was a simple install and the faucet seems to be as good or better than one I installed in our other home."
1,Didn't last. :(,"I purchased this phone for my home office. I bought it in August and by October was having issues with it cutting out and having a static filled connection. I am constantly on the phone for work and can't afford a bad connection. I initially thought it was because I have a digital phone line and addressed my concerns with the cable company. After confirmation from them that the connection cutting out was not due to the phone line, I purchased another phone as a replacement and haven't had a single problem. I'm dissapointed this item didn't perform better, and doesn't offer more than a 30 day warranty. For just a slightly higher purchase price at Staples, I was able to get a better performing product with a 2 year warranty."
1,Dead shortly after arrival,"This had generally good reviews, so I took a chance on an ""off"" brand.Phone is larger than it looks in the photo & takes up more desk space than I expected, but that's a minor issue. Instructions would be clear to an IT professional, but not sure everyone would understand the ""telespeak"" acronyms in the manual.The speaker phone worked great the first time I used it--callers said the sound was quite clear. After about 2 hours, I noticed that the display brightness was varying with the caller's speech. The next call I picked up on speaker was terrible. I had a strange electronic buzzing in the speaker and the caller couldn't understand what I was saying.I works fine on the handset and with my Plantronics S12 headset, so it appears that something is amiss with the speaker function. I bought it for the speaker function, so I'll need to return it for something that works."
5,Niles Speaker Switcher- A top performer,"I have three of these units throughout my home. They work excellent and if you decide to go with the ""volume control"" model it makes your purchase that much more convienent. A good choice for any Audiophile............"
1,This sucks,"This tool really sucks.It is made of a very good quality metals, but it does not punch a damn thing."
3,"Sturdy, but not as described","Here's the product description:Holds 15.4-in laptopSleek black finish and solid aluminum hard caseAdjustable cushioned dividers for snug, tailored fitEasy-to-use numerical combination and key locks keeps your computer and belongings safeConvenient, easy-access pockets computer accessoriesThe size is correct. But it's not sleek black solid aluminum. The frame is sturdy aluminum and looks nice. The sides are fabric coated aluminum that is anything but sleek. There is only a key lock, not a combo lock. My latch catches and does not always open.If you are looking for a sleek aluminum case, look elsewhere."
3,"Quick Mixx, Vol. 3",I was hoping that the mix of Shannon - Let the music play was closer to the original song. My wish was not granted. That goes for the balance of the CD. I give it three stars...
4,Overall very pleased.,"Great product. Tracks my running distance and breaks it down into Avg pace, Avg Speed, Distance, Best Pace and more. The only negative I've found was that if the GPS device is worn on my hip it will often loose signal, worn on the arm has worked flawlessly for me. Solid device have had it for 3 years! Rechargable batteries are also a plus."
2,Alarm stopped working after 3 months,"I was happy with this alarm clock while it worked. However, after 3 months, the clock continues to work but the alarm doesn't sound. If I put it right next to my ear I can hear a very faint beeping noise. Not impressed with durability as I purchased it to replace an alarm clock I had used for the past 15 years!"
4,Alarm Cloack,"I like everything about it, except for one thing, the alarm, kind of annoying, but I guess it gets you up."
4,Functional and not too annoying,"I am not a big fan of alarm clocks. Why someone can't make one that is that is functional, but still looks good (i.e. not like an alarm clock) is beyond me. Perhaps that's my calling. Anyway, I needed an inexpensive and not too annoying looking small alarm clock for my guest room, and this one is fine. Simple to use and compact; it met my needs."
1,"Looks cool, if it only told time...","I bought this after reading stellar reviews on the site. I was a little confused when some said that it didn't take time properly, like really, it's an alarm clock!But they were right. I set the alarm clock's time at 11pm and my alarm to wake me at 7am. I fell asleep and was woken by the alarm sound, all good so far. I roll over and look at my wife's alarm clock to see.... 5am. I guess you can say it was a little anxious to wake me. Needless to say, i lost 2 hours of sleep due to this piece of crap. Amazon's return policy is awesome and they will be refunding me, so off I go to read more reviews on other brands. Stay away from this one."
1,Didn't work - TWICE!,"Don't waste your money on this one. I bought this and the alarm feature didn't work. I returned it and the second one didn't work either! The alarm has gone off randomly, but never when needed."
3,Decent alarm clock,"This alarm clock is easy to use and is sleek and doesn't take up much space. The primary reason I bought it though wasn't for the alarm, but was to have a clock on my bedside table. During the day however, you can barely see the clock. The display isn't bright at all and if the room is at all light inside its extremely difficult to read the numbers, which I find quite irritating."
1,"NO day, date or temperature function","There is an error in the product description. This is a basic alarm clock. There is no day, date or temperature function."
3,"Don't know, this was a gift","Priced right. Gave it away for Christmas, don't know if it is good or not."
5,Perfect little clock,I bought this for my Son a few months back.. Does exactly as it should. Not as loud as other people stated.. Think it's just where it should be. Can't beat the price!!
2,not good,"Cute lookin' little clock, but my main complaints are that 1) the alarm volume is very low, and 2) it has an EIGHT-minute snooze interval!! Waaay too long."
2,Not bright enough,"The clock looks nice, functions okay. The big problem is the brightness -- far from being enough. I put it on a nightstand. If the lamp is on, then I can hardly see the time. I have to turn off the light to see it. It is good when you are sleeping -- no light in the room, but not in other situation."
1,Sharp alarm clock,I was very disappointed in this product. I bought it for my son. The buttons on the one we got were very flimsy. The light button would not stay on unless we constantly held it in...it almost seemed like a bad one that someone had returned.
4,Perfect for a Teenager,"Cool clock. Was looking for something really simple to use, and loud! This was a perfect purchase for my 16 year old son!"
5,pure magic,"This book, and Giono's Joy of Man's Desiring, are the two of the most beautiful, wise, transformative works of fiction that I know -- even in translation. The translations are excellent, but Giono's writing, and his vision, are among the wisest and most eloquent in any language -- it is these books that gave me the impetus to be a writer. If you care for nature, and the prospect of humankind living in genuine participation and reciprocity with earthly nature, these are your books. An essential tonic for our collective ecological insanity..."
2,Dangerous unpleasant book,"Odd to judge it this way, but Giono's other works are largely life-affirming, joyous, magical. THE SONG OF THE WORLD is dionysian, cruel, without hope, a curse on humanity --- it says we are fated animals without minds. Reading it is a nightmare. Patriarchy, tyranny, lust, cruelty, brutality, animality (Johnny Rotten once said ""I hate everything that ends with a Y."")Yes, it is a marvellous saga, well-written, magically worded, astounding. But its product is death in a wild world before individual humans could construct their own lives according to their principles and wishes and thoughts. A dangerous book.I have read and re-read TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE, TWO RIDERS OF THE STORM, and JOY OF MAN'S DESIRING several times (though JOY too verges on the dangerous, as does HARVEST). Giono is a writer of genius. Tread carefully."
3,Define your needs,"This is a great book for those working in the landscape industry. It is not a good fit for regular homeowners dealing with a landscaper/gardner. This book will help in giving complex instructions (how to put fuel into lawnmowers, how long the workday will be, how not to get injured, how to install a sprinkler system). It will not help with asking the lawn to be mowed or checking an individual sprinkler head or cutting back growth or all the small things a homeowner usually has done around the yard."
4,Get this book!,"Great book!It's separated into different chapters based on different kinds of landscaping work (papaerwork, masonry, laying sod), and provides complete sentences, with pronunciation guide and English translation, that you can turn to and use immediately. It also has a very useful vocabulary list in the back. It won't take the place of a series of night classes at the local technical college, but it will get you through the work week.If you already speak a little spanish, this is a 5 star book.Downside? There are some typos (misplaced or missing accent marks, wrong gender for noun) that will make the some-spanish speakers a little crazy, and make the non-spanish speakers look like fools to their hispanic workers.Still, I take this book to work with me every day."
4,Helpful in Work Environmet,"In an industry with an increasing percent of Spanish Speaking employees, this book helps a manager with a basic understanding of the pronunciation of Spanish to communicate key work-related information."
1,Fake software,"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT REALLY WORTHY, why should I have to pay $70.00 for some thing already is preintalled and came with my PC, I still have it and defnetly it worth nothing none of the 6 voices came with this software is natural human voice they are all fake robot voice, but the saller seamed to be AT&T so I have a lot of complaines aginst them including their poor wireless service."
4,Darling Ray,"I just got this program this week and really think it's cool. I needed the voice reading to help with classes when my eyes just can't look at the computer screen one more minute. I found that it even helps with my typos that are still real words that spellcheck can't catch. I got another voice, the one that comes with it is mechanical but the AT&T voices are better. Ray is my man now. So far it's been worth it."
3,Out of Date Software -- better is IVONA VOICE,"I tried this software a few years ago on my PC but it is now out of date. It was ok a few years ago.There is now better and competitive priced software from other companies.The two dominant companies currently in TTS are SVOX and IVONA VOICE. Ivona is the best quality voice, as well as international language selection.I replaced the Android voice on my phone with Ivona Voice (AMY British voice or American SALLI). I have since been using TTS Text to Speech primarily on my Samsung Galaxy Note cell phone for reading epub books etc.Ivona for Android is currently free as it's in Beta, but Ivona also has voice packages available for PC and Apple. Just go to their Ivona's website."
5,The best book on why U S electric power is in chaos,"Beder has written the indispensable account of why the American electric power industry is in extreme disarray. This is an account of deregulation, Enron, artificial prices and gross exploitation. It is the book of the moment: timely and relevant to the electric blackouts of August 2003, easy to understand, and really essential. Extremely informative."
2,Does not contain many tracks from game,"The cd has some good tracks, but it doesn't contain much from the game. Only 3 of the tracks are actually from DAOC."
1,50 spiritual classics cd,"CD set was advertised as used but in ""good"" condition. The box was crumbled and tatered. The CDs were dirty and scrached. Disk no. three was so bad as to not be playable completely. CD set should have been listed as ""poor"" condition. I will look into returning it."
1,Spirituality But Not Christianity,"If you are expecting a traditional viewpoint with this book, you will not get it in reading ""50 Spiritual Classics"". It is heavily weighted toward Eastern religion and philosophical thought, which is fine, but it is definitely not balanced. He prefaces his review of the Christian works he presents as being ""too Christian"" for some. If you are into ""political correctness"" then this book is for you."
5,Real World Kung fu,"Ancient Chinese martial arts are revealed in this important documentary that is always intriguing and never pandering. A well-conceived discussion with excellent commentary from noted scholar David Bannon, Ph.D. and interviews of some of the finest LEGITIMATE kung fu masters alive. A rare look into the real world of Kung fu from those who know it best!"
5,Very Impressive,"This is a very well done documentary. Amazing and very inspirational for practitioners of all martial arts, as well as ordinary people. I believe that everyone interested in martial arts should have keep a copy."
1,Badly formated,The DVD wasn't made correctly. I have an all region DVD player and the DVD kept stopping every couple of seconds.
5,excellent compilation,"I purchased this cd about 12 yrs ago at a cultural festival in Toronto called ""Caravan"". At that time, no one was into Cuban music; it was as yet ""undiscovered"" by modern hipsters.It is a fabulous cd.I have since purchased many cd's of Cuban music from old Machito to Afro Cuban All stars. This is simply the finest. Over a decade later, I still reach for this cd first over all others representative of old Cuban styles (except for the entry for Beny More).If you are looking for an introductory cd to Cuban music THIS IS IT. If are a seasoned listener and are looking for an excellent compilation of the Cuban legends and classics to round out your collection, THIS IS IT."
1,DON'T BUY THE KINDLE EDITION!,"I purchased this book for a trip to Europe and only once on the 11-hour flight did I find that the book has been scanned improperly (or whatever the mechanism is for getting it into a Kindle edition). Passages will stop, another passage will start, and without warning, the previous passage will eventually continue a few screens later. It happened frequently and enough that I could not continue reading the book. It seems like a great book and I'd love to read it someday, but DO NOT PURCHASE THE KINDLE EDITION!"
2,Unusually Stupid Americans,"The thing about Unusually Stupid Americans is that while there are some funny moments, many really fall flat. Some of the stupid anecdotes that are meant to amuse, just don't. They're just stupid picks of stupidity. There's much worse out there, we've all seen it, and it feels like the Petras didn't try very hard enough to gather the really good anecdotes. Don't get me wrong, at times, it was hysterical (and oddly bi-partisan), but sometimes, it was just completely dry. Some are hard to understand. Some categories are just random (You have your government, marketing, and then randomly, CARS. What? So I don't know, there was just a lot about this book that was oddly out of balance.Rating: 2/5"
3,fun read,"Fun, lighthearted read when you want to feel smarter than the avarage rambling idiot. This book is filled with them and you'd be surprised at who they are."
2,Poorly Compiled Book of Oddities,"This is a poorly-compiled and incomplete book of odd news stories. The authors just grabbed some stories off the Internet and print short excerpts, often withholding key information such as when and where they happened. The worst part is that many of these stories are unresolved--so they don't give you the ending to what happened.For example, a Memphis high schooler sued the school for $25,000 because he earned an A+ in a course but the highest report card grade is an A. The book doesn't state when this happened or how it was resolved. Then they include the story as part of a section about Stupid Education Lawsuits--of which there are only two examples!Some of the entertainment-related items are a little fun, but there are a lot of pages here that are filled with fluff.It's bathroom-style reading for someone looking for something brainless, but expect to get frustrated because most of the stories are so incomplete."
1,If you buy this book you are the stupidist American of all,"This book is not witty, amusing, or funny. It is just plain awful - and boring to boot. Don't buy it. I rated it at 1-star because there is no 0-star."
1,I have more fun at 'news of the weird',"Very typical trash written only to make money. I didn't buy it, I read some of it at my daughter's house."
2,Buyer Sings the Blues,"The songs may be ""complete"" as the DVD claims, but what isn't mentioned is the inane narration over the beginning of just about every clip on the disk, which spoiled much of the enjoyment for me. I bought the DVD for the Connee Boswell clip (love those Boswell Sisters), but after the narration there's just eighteen seconds of the song left. By the way, even accounting for the age/rarity of the clips, the quality of them often leaves something to be desired, as well."
4,Redi Edge Sharpner,"I purchased this sharpener awhile back and I would say this is a very well made sharpener. It may be a little short which makes it a little hard to really get a good hold on it. But other then that it sharpened all of my dull knives and put one heck of an edge on the blades. Perfect to put it in your pocket or backpack. When I pack for the mountains I don't leave my Redi Edge sharpener behind. It is part of the ""must have"" tools. Purchase this item and I believe you'll be very happy."
2,Horse pendant could be better.,"This pendant is a ""flat"" version of the ""Oberon Design Celtic Horse Pendant"". The Oberon Design pendant is very 3-D, deep lines, very sensory looking, pewter with black leather necklace. I like the Oberon Design pendant better... the one here looks almost the same design but not as detailed and vibrant. However, the price is much lower!"
5,Learning about the birth of Israel & why the non-ending war.,"Now seemed a good time, better late than never, to learn about Israel and Palistine and to try to understand why they can never seem to find peace. After reading The Haj which gave me a Palestinian viewpoint, I chose The Settlers and followed up with The Harvest. They are very well written, informative and moving. It begins at the turn of the century and follows a Russian-Jew family escaping the increasingly dangerious situation developing there. Levin paints a very clear picture of their dreams, goals, strengths and weaknesses. Life was not easy there either but to them it was home. During WWI they fought to help Jews from all over Europe escape death. It is 832 pages that is hard to put down. And reading The Harvest is then a MUST. I feel that I can now better understand some of the problems we see on TV every day."
4,PT-90 is a pretty good plinker,"This gun is not bad. I didn't realize that the front of the barrel flipped up every time you wanted to reload, but thats not a bad thing. It seems kind of like it should be more snug against the bottom of the barrel, but it doesn't seem to be affected at all buy this. The trigger is pretty stiff. 1 CO2 cartridge lasts 80 shots (8 magazines) or so, and by that time the pellets barely come out of the barrel. Never pull the hammer back when the barrel is up, you will be frustrated at how jammed it will be. As far as the shooting part goes, this gun is pretty good. At about 25 feet, you can put a hole in a tin can as long as you haven't already used up most of your CO2. Assuming you can hit the can in the first place, since you have to know what you're doing to hit anything over 20 feet away with a pistol. This is a good plinker to take along with you when you're camping or something."
3,Mediocre outing,"First and foremost, this book is not really about the treasure of Montsegur, at least not in the physical sense, so if you are looking for a good treasure hunt book (in the mode of the DaVinci Code, for example), forget about it.The treasure is a spiritual revelation, and although this book has some moments of fine writing, it also has some deep flaws. The most glaring of which are the terrible ""telling of the future"" scene and the weak ending.However, the book does a nice job of portraying the thoughts and the magic behind the Cathar legend, and the deep evil of the Catholic characters (esp. the Inquisition).All in all, a book that you can get through, and maybe even enjoy, but not a keeper."
1,No time to waste...,"So I'll make this brief. You want to read a thing because of its subject. But reading bad writing is painful. Why would one subject oneself to pain when there is so much beauty to be had in good writing? Like any even half demanding reader, I closed the book and gave it away."
5,The Best Book since Romeo and Julet,"This has got to be the best book that has ever been written by a human writer. The book covers almost every living organism that lives in the marine habitat. If I were stranded on a desert island, this would be the book that I would want to have by my side, hands down. PLease, buy this book, it could one day save your life."
5,Outstanding,"The Mommy and Me video series is a must-have! They are extremely fun and educational. They are worth every penny you spend on them. My 17-month old daughter owns three dozens of videotapes including all Baby Einstein and Bumble Bee vidoes, but she keeps asking for these three videos. They are outstanding. Highly recommended!"
4,Just fun,"If you're easily offended by sexual stereotypes, pretend I gave this 0 stars and move on.If you like a little over-the-top silliness, competent drawing, and discreet airbrushing in place of anatomical accuracy, you might like this one. It has the two female leads (including the girl soldier), always a moment away from disaster, a moment away from rescue, and a moment away from bouncing out of the costume. It has the jungle princess, the king of the monkey-men, and the dashing hero with pencil-thin mustache. It recreates the older kinds of adventures, the great-grandparents of Indiana Jones.""Rascals"" is completely enjoyable: a lot of good, stylized drawing, a little adventure, and nothing at all to think about."
5,"Really, really loved it!","Wow, what a good story! it's rare when I find myself savoring a story this much - the last time was Cryptonomicon!Thanks to a sharp imagination coupled with uncanny ability to keep multiple story lines going without confusing, Asher has created a classic hard sci-fi story that will stay with me for a long, long time."
4,"Good, once you get into it.","The beginning nearly made me drop it, though. The conversations were stunted and broken, but slowly a story comes emerges and it turns out a worthwhile read."
4,Good old hard science fiction...,"It's a very interesting world that Asher brings us into. The centrality of the slugs at the heart of the world's eco-system is more asserted than really demonstrated, but that's a quibble compared to the very interesting lifeforms that exist together in this novel.The action scenes are well-imagined and the author has clearly spent a little time on a fishing vessel (or a good deal of time in secondary research) as his ""fishing"" (not really fish) scenes are exciting and detailed.Ultimately, this book is really about the life-forms that populate it. Asher seems to have loads of fun describing the life-forms and the way they interact with each other. Ultimately, however, the payoff to the premise is surprisingly ""humanistic.""A very good read."
5,"detailed planet, techno displays AND a witty AI drone","Rarely have I ever read such a detailed story about a planet. Such much is taken into the story without it feeling overbearing or bloated. A fine work in this single degree, but it's also a fabulous story.Depth in terms of extraterrestrial fauna, weather and culture of the planet are simply fantastic! Technology displays in communications, weapons, transportation and computation are abound, satisfying even the most techie of the sci-fi readers. Character relationships endlessly being tried and tested... through life and death... through sobriety and drunkenness! Especially love the grisly scenes and reoccurring death. It's not too often a good sci-fi book contains such good descriptions of the horror that nature and mankind can deal out. One last highlight: an actually decent AI character! Sniper! He reminds me of the AI drone from Banks' Use of Weapons as in the AI has a serious attitude problem. Fine stuff!"
3,"good for drafting paper, not good for invitations","I had purchased this thinking that I could use it as a vellum overlay for invitations/cards, but the vellum isn't quite transparent enough for that. Also, if printing onto the paper via an inkjet printer, be careful to let the ink dry fully otherwise it will smear."
1,U think it's vellum but it's not,"So u think ur buying vellum paper - that thick, transparent, strong paper.... But you are not. It's thin and its not that transparent."
5,This book will get you through any crisis,"If you are looking for a connection to God and his Power to help and heal you and your life. This book is where to start and end. I have owned this book for 14+ years and keep giving it as gifts to those I love who are in need of spiritual guidance and help. I have seen it work miracles over and over in my life and in the lives of those I have given it to. If you are at the end of your rope hang on, get this book and open your mind and heart to recieve. Thank you Catherine Ponder"
5,The Prosperity Secrets Of The Ages,This book is the end all book on how to have a successful life including attracting money. This author truly understands the laws of the universe and has for many decades. It is a must read.
3,GoldenBoy,"It's all the episodes but I thought this set contained the film too and it doesn't. But for those who like the episodes, they're all there!"
4,good but...,I saw these videos before i bought it i thought it was good but not as good as the first time I watched it The dvd case holds 2 discs and easily falls out of the holding thing for the dvd when I got the dvd they were both sliding around and they scratched but still played was pissed that they were scratched.
4,fun,"golden boy is a short 6 episode anime series that has a good sense of teen humor, for american audiences, its close to say its the animated version of American Pie. I always have a good laugh watching this once a while, and if you are in the animation business, you should definitely check it out, the last episode pretty much connects to what real life studio job would be like. the style of anime, is various when it comes to exaggerated expressions, not always your typical sterotypes anime faces. to sum it up, this anime is just really fun for shorts and if you have imagination and a sense of humor, (and reached puberty), check it out."
5,love it,"Golden Boy is about a boy who searches for the meaning of life and everything life can teach. The story line was well written and the story itself was hilarious. I bought this for only 12 dollars and i think it was the best 12 dollars i have ever spent on an anime. Kintaro is just a lovable, hilarious guy who makes you keep watching. I've already watched the series twice, but there are only six episodes. Speaking of this, the negatives about the series came in the fact that it was too short and the viewer i guess could predict the end of each episode fairly well. However, i loved the series. I watched it with my girlfriend and she's not into this kinda stuff (anime, and especially anime with sex comedy), but she actually loved it as well. I just wish there were more episodes. So if you love a good laugh, i would buy this series, especially since it's so cheap. :]"
5,Good show.,Very funny comedy anime. Only 6 episodes long but very enjoyable. I watched it when I was a kid but got it here on Amazon years later. Good to watch at the end of the week when you need to relax and have a good laugh.
5,Good book,This is the original version of the book. It has a lot of good tips for teachers in Christian schools. Highly recommended!
5,Stupendous recording,Anyone who enjoys phenomenal orchestral music should purchase this recording. Absolutely overwhelming in its power and vitality. Level of professionalism unsurpassed.
5,"An excellent book, and very surprising","The Vanished is the 7th Roswell high book, and you may thinkthat Melinda Metz, has run out of ideas, however, this book provesthat she is an excellent writer. In the story, Alex, is trapped on the aliens' (Max, Isabel, Micheal,Adam)home planet. Max is spending a lot of time and effort to save him. They are also trying to find the space ship, that was left in the warehouse. This book was so suspenseful and exciting that it took about an hour to read. I recommend it for true Roswell fans, and I think you will find it another excellent creation by Melinda Metz."
3,"The Bond, A Paranormal Love Story","This book could have been much better if the author had expanded the story more. The book was too expensive for the amateurish way it was printed. The book was very poorly printed. It was only 129 pages long. The story line was good but not long enough. The characters were very likeable but had little depth. If this was the author's first book, she has potential."
5,GOD KILLER needs to be in YOUR comic collection!,"Amazing artwork and an epic story! Lance Henrikson is as gravel throated as ever. A brilliant way of connecting comics & DVD. It's the future of comics, add it to your collection."
4,Excellent debut CD,"This group made an excellent debut CD. The lead singer was already known throughout the tejano scene because he wrote a lot of songs for some very well known groups. Excellent choice of songs, music and lyrics. Overall, this Cd kicks...."
5,Enamorada,Primeramente yo quiero felicitar a grupo DUELO porque la verdad es un grupaso yo tube la oportunidad de hir a berlos cuando binieron a Austin TX y yo me quede enamoada de ellos porque la verdad cantan muy bien y a mi me gustan todas sus cansiones pero especialmente la de AMIGUA SOLEDAD yo les deseo lo mejor y que siguan adelante para seguir escuchando su musica porque como grupo DUELO no hay ni va ha aver otho. SUERTE.yo le aconselo a la jente que compre el disco porque la verdad no se ban a arepentir.
4,Meet the Parents!,"This novel has Sunako's father appearing after he discovers that his baby girl is in a ""relationship"" with Kyohei. Of course Kyohei tries to explain, but to no avail. Many humorous things happen, of course, but the story is pretty well plotted out. There's one or two parts that do get a bit saggy throughout the volume, but overall it's a decent read.My only complaint is that this volume is the first step in a long line of following volumes that contain too much filler. Filler can be fun, but not when the plot points are dragged out into infinity."
3,Maybe . . .,"This movie might be great if you are a huge Rondey Dangerfield fan, are in love with Jonathan Brandriss, or like cheesy, unsophisticated comedy. It's not a great film, and it's not especially funny, but it has its moments and I would imagine adolescent girls might find it amusing. Not bad; just not very good, either."
4,Soccer Girls,"I really like soccer, so I thought this was a pretty good movie. Its a young girls soccer team who is impossible to teach, they are hopeless at soccer, so the coach gets his son to join the team, and dress like a girl so nobody knows. It's pretty good. Ya might like it if you like movies like Switching goals, and the big green."
2,Oh dear me . . .,"Poor Jackee Harry. I won't say poor Rodney Dangerfield, because (thankfully), I haven't seen him in anything else. But I know poor, poor Jackee Harry can and has done so much better than this sick piece of filth. Some scenes are so darkly unfunny you'll find yourself covered in gooseflesh. An utterly hideous 'comedy'--my condolences to all the cast.... Still, Jonathan Brandis is in it, so it's worth watching, eh? :)"
5,old family raunchy humor..,"Brings back loads of memory when i was younger. great for children for the straight forward script, but hilarious for the smarter folks who can read beaten the lines."
3,A Dangerfiled movie mor for kids,"I've seen all of the Dangerfild movies (basicaly because he's my favorite actor) I thought this one would of been his worst. Don't get me wrong though he was great in this it was just that it was more for kids. I did feel that Rodney worked awsome with the kids, excpecially Jonathan Brandis. Brandis was also good in this he played his role very well."
3,I only like it because of the cute guy,"I saw this movie on TV...and I thought ""wow what a cutie! "" Jonathan Brandis is so cute in this movie but I don't like Rodney Dangerfield. The movie was pretty corny...cheesey...and poor Jackie Harry could've done a better film...but it's a cute movie...and so is Jonanthan Brandis..."
4,soccer,"Lady bugs is the funniest movie about soccer. Rodney dangerfield is hysterical, and jonathan brandis is super hot."
4,great book!,I would recomend this book if you want to know where to hike and enjoy the area around orange county!
1,Some pretty basic problems,"Jerry Schad is obviously a committed and knowing hiker, and I only recently got into hiking. I like his longer explanations of some of the things on the hikes. But I had several problems trying to use this book.1. The worst thing is that his descriptions of a lot of the hikes are confusing. We finally gave up using it as a result and switched to other books. In many cases, he also doesn't give distances where you find things or make turns. We've gone off course many times as a result, or searched all over the place for what he's talking about, and that is not fun. When he does give distances, they're sometimes not right which throws us off worse.2. The maps are bad, hard to follow. Robert Stone's book has much better maps.3. For some hikes, he doesn't give an actual hike at all, just says there are a lot of trails you could take here. I don't need a hiking book for that."
1,Stay Away,"Really, stay away from this book. It was revised in 2006 and not only are there STILL references to trails that have not be open to the public in ages and misleading information, but the directions are not adequate.Having been in the wilderness using Shad's directions, it is clear the author hasn't been on many of the trails. 50 Hikes in Orange County (by Klein) has filled that gap in quality, accuracy and frankly entertainment - for the avid hiker, that is."
2,"Bad maps, bad directions","Agree with some other complaints here--Poor maps and confusing directions. One hike in the book doesn't even exist.Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because some of the chapters are good. But if a hiking book doesn't have the two basics so I can find my way around, the rest doesn't matter too much."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"This case fits the camera very well - but the icons that tell you what the different buttons are for, are covered by the case."
3,decent wedge and decent price,"relatively inexpensive wedge, forged is a plus, and grip is decent. design is classic and sleek.grooves could have been cut better to get more grip on the ball. shaft seems not be true temper dynamic but a low budget version shaft, and shafts are very important in this game. but overall its playable.you can get very cheap wedges either making them yourself or taking golfsmith's club workshop where you get to learn and make a sand wedge yourself for 15 bucks and get to keep it at the end."
4,Great Sand Wedge; Good Value,"I've been playing for about a year and have been using this club for quite some time. I don't have a point of comparison as it's the only 56 degree wedge I've ever played with, but I've found it to be easy to hit, pitch, and chip with so long as I'm swinging well. I do sometimes ""blade"" the ball with this club when I'm trying to swing it easy for a short pitch up onto the green, but that is probably more to do with my grip than anything else. I've been hitting this club well on all manner of ""scoring"" shots and have a lot of confidence with it, something that I can't say about nearly any other club in my bag."
1,Buy it used.,There is only one thing that makes this book worthwhile; Buying it used on Amazon.com. Some of the information contained in this volume is usable some is not. The great thing about buying it used on Amazon. com is that you can read the reviews from people who actually bought this book and then if you still want it you can get it for a fraction of the original price and often without paying for shipping. Thanks Amazon.
1,Waste of Money,"This book is a list of items that is a complete waste of time and money. The guys on TV sound good, but this is really a complilation of stupid tid-bits of information. Save your money."
1,"Same old, same old.","'Same old, same old' says it all. There's nothing here that you haven't already heard from a hundred health reports on television. Save your money. You'll learn more looking up the problem on the Internet."
1,Save Your Money,Like folk tales and myths? Buy this book. I was so disappointed when I got it that words escape me. There is little in this book that Grandma can't tell you and there is little that corresponds to the infomercial. Alternative medicine may have it's place but this book does not. Save your money.
1,WASTE OF TIME.....,"I'm a 3rd year mdical student.....this book is such a fraud, the infomercial implies so much...IE the Nobel Prize for Ulcers.....EVERYBODY KNOWS ULCERS ARE caused by the bacteria Helicobacter( though a non bacteria problem can also cause stomach ulcers..((genetic proton pump defects etc..)), ...the so called SECRET treatment..see your Doctor...he'll give you some antibiotics..no big deal.This book.......its common sense, and what any doctor...or even a 2nd year med student can tell you FOR FREE"
4,Honest Opinion,"This book is not the answer to all of your medical needs. What it is, is a great book that will help motivate you to live healthier and possibly improve some of your medical conditions. My motivation came from just having the book in front of me and being able to look up anything on the fly using the glossary in the back. Yes you can find this stuff on the Internet but what can you trust and what can you not trust. I trust this book for one. Example: Potasium can lower your blood pressure. This may explain why I feel better after eating a Banana. Its not a cure, but defintely something that makes me feel better. I love this book for many things I found inside."
1,Daily newspaper is worth more,"Many ""secrets"" are really not secrets at all, if you do some research. A frozen banana as a healthy snack sounds like a health-food-book item rather than a secret that the medical establishment doesn't want you to know about. I was frankly disappointed that I paid good money for this book. This is just a couple samples. Oh! and my favorite health secret article: How alcoholics get an extension on their tax return. Very informative"
1,Mundane,There is really no new or original info here. It is really a waste of time if you are at all familiar with health Keep your money.
2,Not as good as I expected,The articles were short and not very good. There was not much information on each topic. Not a very usable book.
1,I TRADED THIS IN. IT'S AWFUL,"I BOUGHT THIS ""BOX OF HORRORS"" COLLECTION THINKING IT WOULDN'T BE SO BAD. BOY WAS I WRONG, IT'S TERRIBLE. IT CONTAINS 4 B-MOVIES: BLOOD THIRSTY / KOLOBOS / DEAD WATERS /& HIGHWAY HITCHER. ALL FOUR MOVIES R' ON TWO DISC. THE ONLY MOVIE I COULD STAND TO FINISH WAS 'KOLOBOS' IT'S THE BEST OF THIS COLLECTION OF BAD MOVIES, AND IT HAS A VERY UNSATISFYNG ENDING. HORROR FANS: PLEASE TAKE MY ADVISE AND STAY CLEAR OF THIS."
3,"fun, but small",This is a good little ho guage engine. It even makes real smoke! It is a bit tempramental on the tracks...doesn't like going over any switches and gets caught up on them unless your running it fast.
1,Was sold a defaulty product,"I bought this as a present for a friend. The engine didn't work. So i'm stuck with a engine that don't work , and the return time has ran out before it was used. so i'm out $89.70. I would not reccommand this to anyone or buying from here."
4,you are a really good site!,this is the best site so far thanks for being here to so me the wonderful site!
5,A Special Configuration Of Proteins,"This is an extraordinary book. This is science writing at its best. I highly recommend this book because it is very enlightening as to the nature of our brains. There are about 30,000 genes in the human genome. About half of these are expressed in the configuration of proteins found in the human brain.The human brain has about 100 billion neurons. You might be inclined to say ""but only 30,000 genes."" However, genes are complex proteins that work in combination to form the mind so there are almost endless combinations that are available to determine the functioning of the 100 billion neurons."
1,A time-wasting work of staggering ineptitude,"I recently picked up a copy of Marcus' new opus in the secondhand book store near campus. I wish that I hadn't picked it up at all. Who the hell does Gary Marcus think he is? He arrogantly believes that he has solved the mind-brain problem. Psychologists, neuroscientists, and theologians everywhere take note: You're out of a job. If you believe that, you'll believe that pixies live behind my house. This book is not of little consequence, it's of no consequence at all. I hope the secondhand bookstore has a return policy."
4,A decent first novel,"A welcome first effort. Not quite Gibson, not quite Bogart. Nonetheless, an interesting effort to mix the various archetypes. The story is better than the attempt to cross genres. An interesting detective novel. I look forward to reading more from this author."
3,Written By Romance book Author Amanda Clark!,This is a good Harlequin romance book about a country boy a and a city girl but be aware that this page has the author mistakenly identified as Mary Higgins Clark when it not her but a romance book author named Amanda Clark. I could be wrong but I seriously doubt that famous mystery writter Mary Higgins Clark as ever penned a Harlequin romance book and I think that Mary Higgins Clark and Amanda Clark are not the same author but two intirely different authors!
4,Interesting read,"This author has developed the Fran Varady character over three novels. Fran is a young, feisty homeless person who seems to thrive on being alone and a loner. The plotting here, as with earlier outings for Fran, involves the down and outs, the homeless and the poor of England. For something different to the usual can-do, superwomen of female-detective crime fiction, give this a try."
3,Only one blinking mode,"I bought this blinking light from MaxiAid and it came really fast, in two days! It is bright enough and easy to use. The only disappointment is that it has just one blinking mode. I thought it may come with three modes like my bicycle rear light: All lights on, blinking one LED at a time, or blinking three LED all at once. I wish the spec was more specific."
1,Forged reviews.,"All the reviews are from 2006, and almost all of them are within a few months of eachother. Even one of the reviews is just copy pasted from another review.Giving it a 1 star to balance out the rating in case people are still ordering this stuff.If I'm wrong, then by all means call me out for it; but it doesn't look like I've misjudged."
3,Just started taking this,I am on my first bottle of Osteozyne. I have heard many good things about this product and was very impressed with the studies I read about the ingredients. I have arthritis developing on my neck and my doctor recommended I start taking Osteozyne.
4,I just placed my 2nd order- well worth it,I feel much better since taking this product. With age our bodies need more nutrients that we get from just the food we eat. Thank goodness there are products like these that provide us with the supplements needed to lead a better quality of life.
1,save your money for something that works,"do not buy this product. their software is full of bugs. customer service is a joke. bought active home software and it shuts down when clicking on certain things inside the program. bought iwatch mobile to view cams from smartphone, have had the software for 4 months and has only worked twice for a total of 5 mins., get message ""server not found"". they only have one level 2 tech for the whole company, level 1 techs cant seem to do anything but tell you how to plug the stuff in or email instructions to you, none of which help. you make an appointment with lvl 2 and wait a week, you get an hour, nothing gets solved, then you make another appointment for a week or two later, then repeat. been doing this for months. i dont know how they get away selling software that does not work, even the tech said it rarely works for him. buyer beware."
1,Unusable due to interference.,I bought some X10 Cameras and they had serious interference. X10 Tech could not provide a solution so I had to send them back.I had to pay return shipping even though the X10 Cameras would not work properly. Every other company I have done business with will pay return shipping if their product is defective but not X10.I will not purchase anything from X10 again.
4,Niles Audio SSVC-2 Speaker Selector with Volume Controls,Works great and I like volume controls with click steps so it is easy get back to your favorite settings if you need to temporary change in a room. It has impedance adjustment in the back and that is very good. I would have liked it to accept bigger gauge wire. It does accept wire gauge in the specs so I am happy with this product and would recommend it.
5,A Must-Have for any Reader's Library,"I picked this book off of a discount warehouse shelf because of it's cover, and was intrigued by the description on the back. I bought it, but brought it home and forgot about it, until I found it a few months later. I started reading, and I can honestly say that I don't believe I shut the book until I was finished. Keith Miller creates this amazingly original world, and surrounds it in a brilliant vocabulary. This has to be one of the most intelligent texts I have ever read. Buy it, Read it, Love it....You won't regret it."
2,flat despite imaginative content,"Miller creates imaginative settings and many idiosyncratic characters in a manner reminding me a bit of Mervyn Peake, but unfortunately the Peake novel this most closely resembles is Titus Alone, the aimless and disappointing third novel of the Ghormenghast trilogy. Miller's characters are never developed enough for one to care deeply what happens to them, and their dialogue is stilted and pretentious. They respond deeply to each other's stories and predicaments, but this isn't a substitute for getting a response from the reader."
4,A good fun read,"I heard the movie wasnt too good, but a friend recommended this book and I was glad he did. It was a fun, interesting read."
5,What a ride!,"Every boy's fantasy, to be able to go anywhere you want with just a thought. No girls locker rooms would be safe. I can understand the motive of the government for wanting to control and asset like this. I did see the movie before I read the books, but still found the books hard to put down."
4,SF done right,"I picked up Jumper at a used book sale on half off day - strictly on blurb alone, never heard of it nor the author. One idea - one person could teleport - and the rest of the book was exploring what that means. This is exactly what sf at its absolute best is about. Except the main character was much more developed. And certainly not a perfect character. An amazing find. I can't wait to try another one."
2,The sequel,This book answered some questions left after watching the movie. The book itself came in good condition and in a timely fashion.
1,Warning -- read first 10 pages before giving to children,"My 12 year old son received this book from his grandparents who only knew it had good reviews for science fiction. After the 8th page, he came to his Dad very disturbed. I try very hard not to be extreme in censoring what my son would like to read. However, this is a teaching moment that we wished we could have avoided for quite a few years. My advice would be to at least read the first 10 pages before giving it to any children."
1,Jumper,"PARENTS BEWARE!!I purchased this book for my ten-year old son because it was a highly recommended book for adolescents and had an appealing cover. My son brought the book to me and said that he ""didn't think he should be reading it"" because it talked about ""nasty things"". Out of curiosity I started to read it and was horrified at the graphic scene described... I think the book should have a warning on the cover that it contains sexually explicit material. I feel like my son and I have been raped!"
1,Not for the Christian reader!,"I bought this book because the movie left something to be desired as far as the story was concerned. I only was able to read thirty two pages before I had to put it down. In those thirty two pages there is a very detailed description of an attempted rape of a teenage boy by three men,enough inappropriate use of God's name to make me cringe, and tons of ""F"" bombs and other forms of profanity. As a Christian I was very offended by the contents of this book. I don't recommend it to anyone who has similar morals and standards."
1,not an over protective mom,"The rating that I have given this book is not for the storyline, but for its content being geared to young readers. I recently selected this book for my 10 year old son. The jacket nor the reviews listed in the book gave any clue of its adult content. This book is filed under the ""young reader"" section in bookstores. I cannot believe the rape act in the beginning of this book is meant for anyone to read under the age of 18. This book may be well written, but not for a youth or even a young adult. It is acts like this that encourage parents to call for censorship."
4,"Great book, poor movie","This book gives you a relatively fun and believable portrayal of an unbelievable situation.Forget the movie...it barely has anything to do with the book. This was one of Gould's first novels and he didn't have quite the finesse he has now, but this was a fun, smooth read. In fact, this one was one of my ""BK books"" back in the day--the book so engrossing you'd sit for hours in an uncomfortable chair at Burger King, ignoring all other obligations, to finish. ""Wildside"" was another one.This book hit a number of my buttons, and if you like stories about personal teleportation, personal revenge, and fighting the government while attempting to sort out your personal problems, this book is for you.Also, don't miss the even better sequel ""Reflex."""
4,very different from the book and very good...,very different from the book and very good...anybody interested in teleporting would like this version..am thinking of getting the other ones by this author..
3,So so,"I really liked the idea behind this book and parts of it were fascinating and parts were sort of boring. It's not bad for a light, quick read but could have been so much more."
2,"Steven Gould's first ""Jumper""","Because of the movie and before going to see it, I wanted to read Gould's novels. So I started with the first one, this one. The story concept is excellent. The emotional rollercoaster is way overdone. Over all I think the writing is rather poor. It is not clear where the story is going re: sequels. The Paladins are not in this book or even hinted at. This was a first novel, so perhaps that is understandable. I could not get my hands on Reflex the sequel he wrote 13 years later (out of print); nor have I read his 6 intervening, unrelated works. I did get the novel ""Jumper: Griffin's Story"" which he wrote as the backstory of the character from the Jumper film. This is SOOOO much better written than the first that I wonder if the same person actually wrote it. Of course with 9 novels under his belt, perhaps Gould has improved markedly."
2,I seem to have read this before...,"Someone discovers they can teleport without machinery in times of stress and then learns to use it to their advantage. Isn't that the premise of Alfred Bester'sThe Stars My Destination(also known as ""Tiger Tiger"") written in 1956?Why, YES, so it is!Alfred Bester should get at least SOME public credit for this - especially with a film based on it leading the charts. Not a new idea at all, but an interesting re-working I think."
4,I wanted to keep reading this wonderful story,"One of the better science fiction stories I've read this year. Highly recommended. Only four stars because the end is at a point where a lot more story could be told. The sequel is calledReflex (Jumper), and I'll find a copy and read it soon enough.Teleportation. That's the premise and plot. It's a first person perspective of an intelligent young man who suddenly discovers he can teleport.At first, all he does is escape bad situations, but then, as he explores his power, the main character begins to live. This is a coming of age novel as much as a story about teleportation.This is a good book. The main character has realistic issues, the plot flows naturally, the settings are well described, and the pacing is riveting. I read it in one sitting. Worth buying."
3,"great story, but content may not be appropriate for younger readers","We ordered this book for a reading/literature class for our middle school 7/8th grade). We'd like to mention that the language and content is a bit much for this age group. The story is great, but we would NOT recommend this book for younger audiences because of some of the content. Some of us had seen the movie (which I believe is PG-13), and were very surprised how different the book was.Please do not interpret this review as a poor rating, we just want to share that the content may not be appropriate for younger readers. Thanks!"
5,So that's what the big deal is all about.,"People made such a fuss about reading this book. Now I know why. Excellent. Something I'll read again in a few years, I'm sure."
4,"Fun, entertaining story. Not the same story as the movie!","I saw the movie Jumpers on 2/14 and thought the the main idea - that of a jumper would make for great story. However I felt that the move was very flat and felt that it left out a lot of things.The next day, I went to the bookstore looking for this book, thinking that it would fill in some gaps. Instead I found a completely different version of the story. The book is much more interesting and entertaining. I would definitely recommend the book to anyone who enjoys sitting back and enjoying a good story."
4,Jumper,"I liked this book.It won't win the Pulitzer, but it will keep your attention.It follows the idea of what if... such and so was possible? What would happen? A good read. I liked it so much I read the sequel Reflex which was even better!"
3,Not at all like the movie..,"The main Characters are pretty close.. Davy, Dad and Millie.. but the movie is very Sci-Fi and the book is really about a Davy dealing with a bad home life, an abusive alcoholic father, a mother who left him behind (with that abusive dad) to save herself, and how Davy uses his Jumping, involving himself in political issues (I'm being vage here not to give any spoilers away) I liked that the book held more character detail (as they always do), but I like the movie's version of the story with the guys hunting Davy, vs the political stroy plot of the book, which is so not Sci-Fi. I think it's really weird they would re-print the book cover with pics from the movie.. all the pics show places/character that are not in the book!.. all this said, I liked the book, but was disappointed in the direction the plot took... probably beacuse I saw the movie first.. I dont know if I would have liked the book more if I'd read it before seeing the movie."
5,Jumper brings you right into the book,"Steven Gould has made the perfect book! A book With actoin, suspense, and love. Its about a boy whos father abuses him for the littleest things. When he finaly runs away he gets picked up by a so called fiendly trucker. He takes him to a resteraunt and gets him a big breakfast. But after about a half an hour they pull off to a desreted turn off. There are a couple of pick up trucks there and nothing else. The driver gets out of the car and tells him that he wants him to meet a couple of friends of his. The next thing he knows hes beinged raped. But when they start taking his clothes off he some how telaports him self hundereds of miles back to his house. Then every things starts to unfold and he finds out that he can only telaport to places hes been. This book is suited for about the ages 13 and older. it deals with real life problems that teenagers go through."
4,Light but Fun,"Jumper is a fast paced, hard to put down sf adventure about a young man named Davy who can teleport. While reading this, one can not help but ask themselves, what would I do if I could teleport? The book excels with it's characterization. The villains aren't purely evil but human, and the heroes aren't necessarily flawless. Gould does a good job with Davy's relationship with his girlfriend. It is touching but not sappy. Jumper is not a deep novel, but it is a good one."
5,Truly Amazing!!,"""Jumper"" is one of the most exciting books I have ever read. I can read it time and time again, and I will never get bored. This title should be a series of books."
2,Simply awful,"This is the worst book I've finished in a long time. Only a sunny beach in Hawaii and no other book for days pulled me through. Thin, one-dimensional characters with ridiculously over-simplified emotions and ham-fisted clunky dialogue abound in this adolescent teleportation fantasy. Perhaps an introverted teen (from the eighties) might find the characters intriguing, but any mature reader, even a sci-fi fan, would have a hard time not laughing at most of it."
4,Ihave read and re-read this book through-out the years.,I found this book to be very humerous and tense while still maintaining a believable plot. It is very interesting how the reactions displayed by the charaters are very life-like and the text scans very smoothly. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a book that empowers the reader .This book leaves you feeling superior to other people in this world.
4,Much better than I expected,"I found this on my brother's bookshelf, and I'd never heard of it or the author despite it being several years old, so I didn't expect it would be that great, but my brother recommended it so I gave it a try.I was glad that I did. This was a very interesting story, with solid interesting likeable characters, and a lot of depth, which is something that has been lacking in most of what I've read lately. I read this pretty quickly, because it kept me interested, wanting to find out what would happen next.This wasn't a great book, but it was a good story that was well written, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good story that is easy to get through."
5,A giant leap into worlds of possibility,"Jumper is one of the most entertaining books I've read in many years, and I read a lot of books. David Rice has a hard life, abandoned by a run-away mom and enduring the abuse of an alcoholic father. One time, though, he finds himself displaced, instantaneously teleported to a familiar spot. When it keeps happening, David learns to control his jumps, arriving wherever he wants. What does he do with his new-found power? How does it change his life?Jumper is exciting, while a deep portrait in character and themes. I enjoyed every minute of reading it. I think I just might jump over to more from author Gould."
4,The original Jumper story,"Those of you who saw the movie and are now looking for the book need to know that while all the stories (film or print) with Jumper in the tittle, have characters with similar names and some similarity, each of them is different so you can read or see them all without knowing what will happen. This book is the original story that inspired the movie, and the sequel to it is REFLEX. Those two books focus on the story of one jumper and his significant other. There are no paladins in either of these books, but there are bad guys and threats to our hero. This is a topnotch set, and since Amazon is offering a deal to buy both books at once, I suggest you do it! Then, you can get the book written to be include paladins in the print world. It is a different person from either the movie or the original books, and you can enjoy what you liked about the series yet again."
5,The best Orchid book around,"If you just got your first Orchid and want to learn how to care for it or you've been collecting for years, this is a ""MUST HAVE"" book. I have many Orchid books and none come close to this one for readability and useful information. The photos are also wonderful. The person I bought many of my Orchids from carries this book in her back pocket and despite being incredibly knowledgeable, refers to it several times ever day. You can't go wrong buying this book."
3,Not very practical,"Depending on what you're looking for, this book is not for everyone, definitely not for the beginners. There're very little instructions on how to cultivate orchids. I find the binding of the book awkward. The pictures are of great quality though."
2,Didn't quite hit the mark.,"I didn't care for the hero one bit. I found him to be one dimensional and extremely cruel. He doesn't start to show a little warmth until 2/3 through the book. Sorry, not my cup of tea."
1,"Cheap, plastic, unreliable and unworthy","The regulator on this tool is just about the cheapest POS I have ever encountered . . .even considering the quality of other things made in China. The fittings leak, and all test results are rendered unreliable due to the generally poor quality of this tool. Save your money and buy something made in the USA by a quality tool company."
3,Good for the novice,"The information in this book is useful for the novice, new Oscar owner, or someone thinking about purchasing an Oscar. If you already know what you are doing, you'll find this book to be a sleeper. It covers the basics including feeding, breeding, equipment, and housing for the Oscar. Though it's written in a clear manner, the author has a problem with throwing in his personal opinions into the text which I found to be very annoying. The color photos aren't the best but do their job."
3,Good Beginners How-To Manual,"This is a short, easy put together reference for the beginning Oscar hobbist. Not too much info, but enough not to overwhelm. Would be a good starting book for younger people."
5,Can't understand the negative reviews here,"Obviously some people just don't like Robert Kiyosaki and will attack anythng he writes. But I have to wonder what usss they have against this book; is it FREE ENTERPRISE or HELPING PEOPLE?I also recommend 'The New Professionals"" by Charles W. King and James Robinson and ""Successful Network Marketing for the 21st Century"" by Rod Nichols.Network marketig's time has come, but I am glad that some people disgree. When it becomes obvious to the masses, the opportunity will be gone. Sort of like trying to buy a fast food restaurant today (even though that was violently opposed and criticized at one time) when there are already 4 franchises in your area.It's not easy, but it does work."
1,Warning - author/publisher selling same book twice!,"This book is the virtually identical to ""Corba Networking With Java"" from the same author and publisher. Both books are content-free and contain only vague discussions of general resource/development planning issues that have nothing to do with Java or DCOM."
2,The title is VERY misleading,"The entire text contains just six lines of Visual J++ (on page 69). One of the appendices also contains half a page of Java (on page 306). Neither example is of any value.The book only discribes DCOM in very general terms. You will not learn how to use DCOM from reading this book!Amazon described the book as ""hand's on"". This is clearly a false assertion. It is a book for technical managers and is distcinctly hands-off."
1,Vapid description of DCOM with no J++ or even Java content,"I was singularly impressed by this book's inability to convey any information about the two subjects in its title, DCOM and J++. Instead, it jabbers superfluously about cost budgeting of software projects and how to do business over the internet.The worst investment I've made in a technical book."
1,It's not helpful for a programmer.,"Actually, I just browsed the book, but I'm sure this book is certainly not helpful for a programmer who want to know how DCOM works with Visual J++ 6.0. I have returned it to Amazon."
5,Great Movie,I was fortunate to see this on the big screen last month. I am now and forever will be in love with Barbara Stanwyck. This great story should rightfully replace 'Wonderful Life' as the Christmas movie of choice. Those who have seen 'Double Indemnity' know the chemistry between these two fine actors.
5,Rememer the Night,"Great movie, I got it as a gift for my daughter and watched it together, Love it. Hope to watch it again, Thank you"
5,"Absolutely Purr-fect! Oh! Miss Barbara,...how you purr!","This is a most beautiful movie. Not solely because of the fact that Miss Barbara Stanwyck is magnificent...as always,...and that Mr. Fred MacMurray is majestic,...but because of the fact that every essential element of the movie come together to produce a wonderful motion picture: A most touching love story. The plot is absolutely charming. The character actors and actresses enrich the picture immensely. The costumes are wonderful, and beautiful for one to behold. I never tire of watching this movie,...especially around Christmas time. It takes one into another time and another world. A beautiful world of days gone by. My family and I adore viewing this picture...again and again. Each time we watch it, it seems as if it is the very first time: That is the impression which it leaves upon one. This is the beauty of classic movies,...they never lose their touch...and one never tires of them."
4,"A warm, nostalig less-known classic for Christmas","Barbara Stanwyck always had a special star quality and it shines in this romantic, nostalgic Christmas movie from the 40's. I was not much of a fan of Fred MacMurray unless he was doing comedy, but this movie is a delightful exception. He really is good. The premise, that a successful D.A. prosecuting a beautiful thief on Christmas would take pity on her and spring her for the holidays, ending up through a series of unusual circumstances to take her home to the family, and ultimately fall in love with her, is a bit of a stretch, but it all feels right in this warm family film. The way it ends reflects the values of the 40's and is a bittersweet way to wrap up this nice Christmas film, but I really enjoyed this not-too-well-known classic."
2,Remember The Night,"Well, what can I say?? It's an old movie and notvery interesting. I watched it once and probablywon't watch it again. This movie cannot compareto some of the classics."
5,Not Even Snowflake Can Ruin This Movie,"I loved this movie. That's a hard statement for a black man to make about any movie in which Snowflake has a role. Regrettably, Hollywood had few roles for blacks in the 30s and 40s and the roles it had were generally comic relief and blacks played characters typically happy, subservient and dumb. Snowflake is Fred McMurray's butler and made a few early scenes in the movie very dated. (""He's not too bright, but he makes a great sandwich""). Nevertheless, the movie has a great script and gradually builds where the viewer roots for the improbable pairing to work out. I'm surprised that I've never seen this movie on cable around Christmas because it is truly a Holiday classic."
4,HEART-WARMING COMEDY-DRAMA WITH FRED AND BARBARA,"Stanwyck is very appealing here as Lee Leander, the shoplifting gal who goes to stay with DA MacMurray and his family during the Christmas holidays. You'd have to be a grump not to like this sentimental blend of pathos, drama and zaniness which borders on Capra-corn yet never goes over the edge. Realistic are the scenes where Stanwyck experiences a warm, close-knit family (something she had never known) and the scene where she confronts her cold mother (Georgia Caine) is truly moving. Both Elizabeth Patterson and Beulah Bondi give superb performances which are honest and not heavy-laden. This ""holiday-type"" is great viewing for any time of the year! A superior Leisen directorial effort coupled with a terrific Sturges script make this nifty little 1940 flick a keeper!"
5,PROSECUTOR FALLS IN LOVE WITH DEFENDANT DURING XMAS TRIP.,"SWEET AND TOUCHING LOVE STORY MADE WHEN MOVIES WERE ABOUT PEOPLE AND HAD A STORY. SEX WAS HINTED AT, NOT THROWN IN YOUR FACE. A MOVIE MORE FULLY ENJOYED BY MATURE PEOPLE THAT BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SUBTLETIES OF LIFE. GOOD ACTING AND A LOOK AT TWO PROMINENT ACTORS IN THE EARLY PART OF THEIR CAREERS. THIS MOVIE ISN'T BEN-HUR BUT A NICE WAY TO SPEND NINETY MINUTES ON A QUIET EVENING."
3,This book may not be what it seems.,"Those interested in this book should be aware that it is simply a response to another book, ""Instrumental Music in the Worship,"" by M. C. Kurfees. Kurfees was a strong advocate of the regulative principle, and therefore opposes the use of instrumental music in Christian worship. Briney, on the other hand, goes to great lengths to refute each chapter in Kurfees' book, point by point. The predominant discussion of the book is the exact meaning of the Greek word ""psallo,"" and it's relevance to the instrumental music debate. If you want a book that looks at the subject of instrumental music in worship from a broader Biblical perspective, see my ""The Biblical Foundations of Instrumental Music in Worship: Four Pillars.""The Biblical Foundations of Instrumental Music in Worship: Four Pillars"
3,Not bad,"This EP is nothing special... But for BB fans it's worth the 5 or 6 bucks.Track 01: So Cold (acoustic)**a live recording.. would have liked a professional studio version of it but still a great version of the song**Track 02: Blow Me Away**from the Halo 2 soundtrack, the song, while good, seems just a little but commericial for me.. and you can tell in the lyrics**Track 03: Lady Bug**a curious b-side that i'm guessing was an outtake from the new album, its a little different then BB's normal style**Track 04: Away (live)**nothing worth noting, just a live version of the normal song**Track 05: Breakdown (live)**this being one of my fav songs off the album, i enjoyed this one more then track 4, but still nothing that special**All in all you will definitley want this for your collection if you're a BB fan just the 2 exclusive songs. The other 3 live songs are just an added bonus."
3,Eh.. its OK...,"Just to let you all know, I am a HUGE Breaking Benjamin fan (and not because my name is Benjamin), but that doesn't stop me from looking at Cd's with an impartial view. So let me say now, this CD, not that good. It's not because of the songs, these are some of my favs, Blow Me Away right up there, but it's the live. To be brutally honest, Ben Burley sounds like he has the Flu. Honestly, if you play the studio version of So cold next to the accoustic version, there's no comparison. So heed this advice, Just download Ladybug and Blow Me away from iTunes, and get the others from WANA."
2,too short for the money...,"Way too short for the money. I liked the live version of So Cold, but the rest of the songs on the albulm were just eeh..."
4,They've had better,"The first 2 songs are great, but the last few are live so of course they don't sound as good. But I still love the band and the CD."
3,Nice Ancillary CD from BB,"This EP from Breaking Benjamin is a time marker as the band continues to tour (and they were great here in Philly!). If anything, it's a maxi-single for HALO 2 and the song ""Blow Me Away"" from said game. (The band members are documented game heads. If you haven't read the GREAT book ""Amp'd,"" you really should!) But you also get two curios here as well.The live acoustic version of ""So Cold"" shows exactly why this song and band is fantastic. Stripped of the electricity and volume, ""So Cold"" still holds it's own as a composition. The other ""new"" song here is the surprisingly punky ""Ladybug."" Sounding completely unlike any song from the first two albums, it's a fun and highly entertaining extra.I give this 3 stars because the two remaining live songs are just so-so, and because the EP is a little pricey. But as a segment of Breaking Benjamin's growing discography (and great work; these guys have gradually become my favorite new rock band), worth having."
2,Cute-Not real Smelly!,"I looked forward to getting this book to read to my boys, as they love scratch and sniff books. However, as cute as the pictures are, the scents in the book are faint at best, and even the few faint ones only smell the first few times. Not one for a scratch and sniff collection, the Party, Shopping, Garden are much better choices for smelling. I hope this helps, we have many smelly books, and this one is not one of the better ones. I would not purchase another of this series or give them as gifts! :("
1,Scratch-and-Try-to-Sniff,"My 20-month-old son has been a huge fan of scratch and sniff books since he started ""reading"" as a six-month-old, so when I saw this new book, I immediately bought it. We were both disappointed. The storyline if fair, but what's most disappointing is the extremely weak-smelling stickers. After searching the far ends of the earth for scratch and sniff books for my son, I've concluded that you just can't beat the scratch and sniff series -- ""Scratch and Sniff Shopping,"" ""Scratch and Sniff Food,"" and ""Scratch and Sniff Garden"" in terms of wonderful, long-lasting scents and bright, clear pictures that appeal to very young children. Even if your child is a scratch and sniff fan like mine, don't waste your money on this book."
5,Awesome!,"I bought this stroller for Christmas for my then 16 months old daughter. It was love at first sight for her! Two years later and countless hours of play with it, this stroller is still standing and rolling like a charm! My daughter takes it with her on our long walks, and is not always super gentle with it...so I am quite impressed with the quality of this stroller (and cannot beat the price!). After 2 years of almost daily use, it seems like the elastics that connects the fabric to the frame are getting looser, but even if they break, I could easily sew them back.Great toy!"
5,"Durable, Sweet and Speedy","My two-year-old daughter is obsessed with baby dolls. I'm so glad I chose this doll stroller. It's compact, shockingly durable and easy for her to maneuver. She's been pushing it around the house all day. We even took it for a test spin on the sidewalk. I highly recommend this one."
1,"Very cheap, go with the one at target for 9.99 instead","I ordered this for my 15 month old for Christmas. I expected it to be fairly small/cheap not only because of the price but because there really is nothing to it, comparing it with the others listed on amazon. When I got it I was shocked its so cheap. Like the cloth the seat is made out of is sewn together so crappy and the plastic for the handles isn't smooth, like any grooves in if are sharp, in order for our daughter to play with it I needed to sand the handles.Why didn't I send it back ASAP?? because I gig if on Christmas Eve. A week after I should have, and I wanted to surprise for her in the morning.Save yourself shipping and disappointment and get one at target for 9.99. So cute and durable."
2,I don't think this stroller would last us very long....,I thought this looked like a nice stroller for my 18 month old but I was very unhappy when I recieved it today. The quality seemed very poor - the handles were already loose and the wheels seemed very flimsy. I'm fairly certain it would not last a month in my house (between my 18 month old and her 3 year old brother) - so I've already scheduled a pick up to send it back. Going to go ahead and get one of the more expensive ones that have consistent good reviews. Avoiding tears and aggravation in the future will be worth the extra $$ I spend.
2,not what i was looking for,I was looking for a cd of Del ways songs. This is a nice cd of just one song. The music is nice but its a sing along cd of just the music and i dont sing. I just wanted to listen to him sing. we will keep looking for del way's cd i do like shopping with amazon. we have never had a problem just made a bad selection. thank you laura happy shoper
1,So confusing I couldn't through first 10 pages...,This book was so confusing that I couldn't get through the first ten pages. The writing style was very jumpy and incoherent.
2,not durable,"I use it for barbecue sauce and basting chicken in its own drippings. It's good for thicker sauce but chicken drippings are really too thin for silicone bristles. It does cleanup very easily with a soak and swish in hot soapy water. It has a nice shape and angle so it fits well in the hand and keeps the business end off the countertop, too.My main complaint is that it lost one of the end middle bristles after only a few uses in a few months (and I wash by hand), as mentioned by a previous reviewer. The silicone or plastic must be very cheap. I usually like Oxo Good Grips but I would recommend a different brand for a basting brush."
2,OXO basting brush,"Not really silicone, rather hairy feeling and it sheds after the first trip in the washing machine."
5,The perfect brush!,"I have not liked previous silicone brushes because they just don't hold on to anything but the thickest basting sauces.Bristle brushes are great for butter and egg washes, but they sometimes lose bristles, hold on to smells, and never seem to clean out well.So along comes the perfect silicone brush!! This hold on to everything, can be used as a basting AND a pastry brush, and spreads evenly.Throw it in the dishwasher, and it's good to go for the next cooking project.I heartily recommend this."
4,Nearly perfect!,"I bought this to spread a thin layer of olive or canola oil on fish steaks and potato wedges. This will have more oil than a regular sprayer, but less than dredges or pouring oil. A great solution, it's a little tough to clean the oil off (hence the 4 stars), but it's probably the best of the bunch; many OXO products have left me satisfied, and I'm a pretty tough consumer."
4,Good replacement for original.,"This replacement spindle works well on our Craftsman mower. I did however have to order the self tapping screws to go with it and wait an additional few days for them. I did not see it stated anywhere in the listing that it does not include the screws to actually mount it to the deck. I did all 3 spindles on my 46"" deck. Out of 9 screws to remove 7 broke! Be forewarned, if you are replacing this part, you should probably invest in new self tapping screws and the pulleys on the top side that have a star pattern that gets worn out. I could have done this whole project in one day if I knew all this ahead of time. Hopefully this review will help someone else to plan their project better than I did."
4,Great price on this Mandrel,"Yes had to wait a few days for this but it was less then half of what my local lawnmower repair shop was going to charge me. This was a great buy, thank you so very much"
2,"It was advertised as ""by Craftsman"" but it was aftermarket by Oregon.","A bit disappointed that it wasn't as advertised ""by Craftsman"". I kept them and they seem to be working fine."
5,Great price,Mandrels break on mower all the time due to ROCKY Arkansas yard. Keep a spare all the time to replace on mower.
3,Had to drill out bolt holes,"The units did not have the same diameter bolt holes as the old unit. I had to drill all of them out.. Not a big deal but somethingto note to anyone looking to do a replacement. I haven't had the chance yet to see if they work, as I found a bad pulley and now waiting on it."
1,Simply awful,"This product arrived diseased and covered with bugs! When we called the seller to complain, the customer service was absolutely horrible and they refused to refund our money - they said there was nothing they could do for us and they even hung up on us! Avoid this seller at all cost!"
5,Awesome,"I recieved a beautiful copy of the frog prince continued, better then i expected! It was even signed by the author!"
5,Extremely inspirational & fun to read! Buy it!,I would definite recommend this book to anyone who wishes to manifest in their lives or just to read to be inspired by the stories!
5,Very interesting book,I am reading this book in between my school studies. Very good pointers ib the book and some good information that I was not aware of. Thank you Beverly
4,The Aladdin factor,"A pretty good book. I expected a ""how-to"" book, but was pleasantly surprised. The book is mostly anecdotes but really helps you focus, and lets you apply the ""lessons learned"" yourself. A very enjoyable read."
2,Simplistic,"I had high hopes for the Aladdin factor, but was very disappointed. It was the kind of thing that could have been consolidated into a short magazine article without losing any content. Also, it was not well researched."
2,It didn't really speak to me,"I'm really not that big a fan of the self-improvement and motivation genre, but even within that, this book wasn't that great. It contains a surfeit of vignettes about asking for what you want. I didn't like the preaching of motivational speakers encouraging their disciples to ask for things they didn't need just because people were nice enough to give it to them. It also seemed like all the people quoted were in sales, the success industry, or motivation. Not a lot of computer programmers, doctors, police or other real careers. Plus, I thought the whole Aladdin parable was pointless."
4,Very Good Book - Strong Recommendation,This book should definitely be a part of your learning experience. It is excellent...Mike Stokes
4,you have to ask,This book was recommended by Andy Albright as a way to expand the way I approached my attitude and outlook.
5,Asking is a good thing,"I hate to ask for help, I have an aversion to it. And being a strong individual has helped me, but it has also hindered me. The Aladdin Factor changed my life in the first three chapters. I realized why I don't ask for help, how that is hindering me, and how to change it. In the first week I began putting the principles into action and wow, I asked and I received. It has been amazing.If you want to begin to receive, you have to ask. This book will teach you how!"
5,Aladdin Factor,Good read and a lot of wonderful stories and helpful hints to boot. Worth the purchase. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to find their way to see all their dreams and desires come true.
3,The Aladdin Factor,I bought this to be given as a gift so what I read of it was ok Maybe if I had read it all I would have liked it better.
4,Historical survey,"This short book (64 pages) relies on writings, seed catalogs and paintings and lithographs to recreate the pioneer gardens of upper Canada. There are chapters on vegetables, fruits, tea and coffee and chocolate substitutes, medicinal plants, dyes, etc. Period drawings and paintings are included to illustrate the text, also full color pictures of the Black Creek Pioneer Village workers engaged in specific activities. I found it most interesting that roasted barley was considered the best ""coffee"", and that the Iroquois of 1750 were quoted in 1770 as saying that they had never seen bees before the Europeans came.There is a large nice bibliography at the end and liberal references scattered in the captions. Every page contains colored pictures."
2,Avoid,"Following hard on the heels of John Byrne's revamp of Superman, ""The Earth Stealers"" is -- well, it's not very good.The Earth and moon are removed from this solar system by a grotesque, space-faring gnome king and his crew. Their purpose is to drag the planet and satellite across the galaxy to a processing plant that will reduce them to rubble and extract much-needed natural resources. The resolution penned by Byrne involves a stupid decision by his foes, as well as a feat by Superman that even his powers should not be able to handle. Bad villain characterizations and improbable plotlines aside, Byrne seems unable to decide exactly how powerful Superman is in this post-""Crisis"" universe. Consequently, this story is flat and uninteresting, best to avoid by everyone but the most diehard Superman (or Byrne) completists.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(n e t) editor"
5,A great Superman story in an outer space setting.,"This is a very entertaining story because Superman is challenged to find a way to free the planet Earth from captivity by extraterrestrial aliens. Superman's power is pushed to the limit, but this gives the reader a truly exciting look at what our hero can do if necessary. If you are a Superman fan or enjoy a good science fiction story with a super hero in it, than this book is a must read for you. It's definitely 5-star reading material."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"This is the very megapowerful Superman sort of story. Superman must find a way to stop a bunch of crazy aliens who can literally nick planets. Not too many heroes with the power level to pull that off, so Superman is an obvious choice to try and stop them. A bit on the whacky and zany side and not that good really."
2,WTF?,"If you liked ""Dr. Octagon"", you will probably be pretty disappointed by this album. The beats are wack, the lyrics are complete nonsense, and it definately does no justice to the original masterpiece. I can barely get through the first 10 tracks without hitting ""eject"" on my cd player. Dont get me wrong, I love Kool Keith; but in my humble opinion, this is one of his worst albums."
2,Kool Keith is boring,"Don't get me wrong, I loved KOOL KEITH back in the Ultramagnetic Days, the Dr. Octagon days, and even the Black Elvis days...but his albums have gotten TOO left field and experimental. When it works (Night Flyer, Celestial, and Alpha Omega) it's dope but when it doesn't (the rest of the CD) it just fails to accomplish anything. If he would do an entire concept album like Doc Oc again with the same dark mood it may be his resurrection."
5,another great grammy produced cd from gilberto santa rosa!!!,"I am not sure what the other reviewer is talking about, lol but everyone is entitled to their own opinion .This is classic gilberto santa rosa.I believe the other reviewer got gilberto santa rosa mix up with another artist , because he is known for great salsa and bolero, not mambo Lol .Any way in my opinion .This is gilberto at his best, great songs, arrangement and production .! I been listening and buying various salsa artists cds for over 16 years so I believe i know a great cd when i hear one, curious to see other reviews from people who brought or heard the cd."
1,GILBERTO SALSA-MONGA!!!!!,"This is one of the WEAKEST CD's out there. Once again GILBERTO is WASTING his talent singing these CORNY & CHEESY ""SALSA MONGA"" songs. I heard this album in CASA AMADEO in the BRONX, N.Y. (Casa Amadeo has been around for 50 yrs, & MIKE AMADEO is a great composer and has written many HIT SONGS for GRAN COMBO, HECTOR LAVOE, CHEO FELICIANO, RAY SEPULVEDA, CELIA CRUZ, & many more). When MIKE AMADEO heard the CD he said, and I QUOTE, ""QUE PORQUERIA!!!!"" (Translation = ""What GARBAGE/JUNK!""). I also thought ""Gilberto SALSA-MONGA"" is at it again, producing SOFT, COMMERCIAL, CRAPPY CD's. If you are looking for good Mambo music you WILL NOT find it in this CD. This CD totally $U--$!"
5,Chemical Sensitivities Awake!,"Migraines, vertigo, dry mouth you guess it, artificial smells give it to me. It runs it the family so I don't feel totally alone but makes for visiting Febreez homes and women's parfum a personal nightmare.Then the Punati Chemical Company (sounds mental) stumbled upon their first and now diminishing brand of odor-free, harmless to pets and people, line of ""Smells Be Gone"" (Unscented).Then I discovered it for a limited time at certain BB&B; stores in 2009. When discontinued, I followed up the BBB wharehouse manager and struck a deal for a slashed discounted truckload of the stuff (Daft, right? You ever see the back of a delievery truck without a migraine and ask whose the wiser.)Now my chain smoker husband and I live in harmony with him 'spraying a mist' over himself after a smoke, our house is markedly odor free, kitty box, and one house fire later a happy home."
4,good,this is a good book but is from 1971 and has 411 black and white illustrations. has 565 pages in small print.
3,Good game for a W&G fan!,"A DVD game is a cute idea, especially for kids who just LOVE anything on tv! The graphics are very good & the game is overall entertaining. This is an EASY game - very little thinking or skill required. Good for younger kids, but you will need to read for them a bit at times. I found it kind of slow as the DVD pauses a lot to accomodate the player remote decisions & also between scenes. There are clips from the W&G; shorts, which are fun to watch.My 7yr old LOVES it & always wants to play... a LOT. I settle in with my ipad during slow moments & we're good to go. It takes 20 min or so to finish one game & we usually play best of 3 for a solid hour of entertainment. I recommend it :)"
4,Awesome,"What a great book! Being very new to website design was a little scary, but this book eases the stress - user friendly. Thoroughly recommended. Get out and buy it!"
2,"Okay, could be better","The reviewer/teacher that posted on April 11, 2001 is right on the mark. This book says nothing on Forms. However, it is a good book explaining the ins-out of the rest of the stuff to a degree. But I feel it spends too much time on hypothetical questioning & marketing your pages, which is good I suppose but a waste of time when most of what she says is common sense. I already knew HTML before going into this book & it shows some new helpers that weren't there before. She doesn't address the pitfalls of many HTML situations like nested tables or backgrounds in cells in nested tables in older browsers (well not that old). The publishing company QUE wrote a book on HTML and it was much better. The whole HTML/web design coding is changing pretty fast with XML/XHTML, & CSS arrising, this book is no better than QUE's published 5-7 years ago. I do not recommend this book. Oh yeah one more thing, it has cheap binding, mine is already falling apart!"
5,Solid Introduction to Essential Web Design Topics,"This is one of the best books you'll find on basic web design techniques. While it does not cover advanced topics such as dynamic page generation (CGI/ASP/PHP/ColdFusion/JSP etc.) and advanced Javascript or advanced cross-browser CSS, it does an admirable job of illuminating the basics that will get anyone off to a good start in their web design pursuits. Diligently apply the material in this book to your projects and you can't lose. I have been designing for the web for over 5 years, the last year and a half full-time professionally, and I have used many of the techniques in this book. Highly recommended."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I am a design student, and have not yet learned web design, or how to build a website.I purchased this book to teach myself the basics of web design. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the language was to understand. I have not yet finished the book, but will continue to use it in the future."
5,Contents,"In this set, you'll find:10 helmeted heads2 helmet-less heads16 tactical shoulder pads12 terminator shoulder pads4 terminator heraldry shields6 torso-fronts wearing tabards/robes4 torso-fronts8 sets of arms with boltguns6 sets of arms with bolt pistols and chainswords2 arms with power swords2 arms with power axes2 power fists2 backpacks2 plasma guns2 flamers2 meltaguns1 front plate for a rhino-based tank1 top hatch for a land raider assault ramp2 side access doors for a land raider2 side access doors for a rhino-based tank1 dreadnought faceplatenumerous accessories and icons relevant to the Black TemplarsSuffice to say, there are not enough parts to convert an entire 10-man tactical squad into a fully Black Templars close-combat crusader squad; however, there is a little bit of everything needed to give your army some flavor. I will, no doubt, be purchasing several more of these as I expand my army."
3,"Nice cast, should have included more parts...","Awesome little pieces to customize your Black Templars...But i felt that for that price games workshop should include at least one more sprue with more parts, when you are converting 2000+ points of space marines into BT youll notice you are short on BT bits as soon as u get to converting your third squad...Great product, a little bit overpriced for the quantity of bits..."
2,A surprisingly poor product from Uni-ball.,"The main feature about these pens is the looks of them, and the other feature of how clear ink transforms into color on paper (the tube between the end of the pen and the ink has a dye that the ink mixes with by the way).For the price, it should write like other Uni-ball pens do, like the Uni-ball Vision. But the ink color is significantly weaker and dimmer and the ink runs out of ink a bit too quickly. The ink is not waterproof, is not airplane safe, and is very dim. Because they do not last long and the ink is dim, this suggests there is not a lot of ink in these pens. If they were cheaper, then I can justify giving a higher rating...but they cost a bit more than the Uni-ball vision but have 2/3 the ink and half the quality.However, the pens do write smoothly...but that's really about it."
4,oxygene for japan music,"the first track is very strange, speed,... and it shows us the style of this album !!!A very speed drum, funkies guitars, a very good voice... and a new advance style for the visual rock !!!"
5,Great CD,"I've always been a Payne's fan. They over the years has been the best group in gospel music side by side with the Original Hinson's.The songs are great as expected and are a blessing. I will admit I liked the orginal Payne Family music better.This is nearly the same music with just a modern day kick in it.Good Job Mike, Loreen and Sandra. Bryan"
5,Outstanding,"This series was originally broadcast in the UK in the early/mid 1990s. It is superbly constructed, beautifully narrated and is easily the best ever programme in the Egyptology genre. Frayling is brilliant at building the suspense - almost as if he was narrating a whodunnit novel. I have been trying to get a copy for years as my original video was lost. Brilliant. An absolute must."
2,Lab Socks....,These socks were not as I expected. I was disappointed with quality and appearance of the socks. The online pic looks much better than in person.
1,Spongebob going downhill...,"I have 2 reasons why I'm giving this a 1 star. The first reason is because these episodes are not so good. And karate Island is one of the worst episodes in the whole series. The other reason is why would someone by this when you could by the first part of spongebob season 4? It has the same episodes and a lot more. The price is also better, If you buy this, you have to pay 13.49$ for 7 episodes, but if you buy the first part of spongebob season 4, you have to pay 18.99 for 20 episodes and 2 of them are double length episodes. If you want these episodes and more buy part 1 of season 4."
2,Some problems,"I got--and paid for--two copies instead of one (probably my mistake); and the print quality in both is exceedingly poor (not my mistake). I would therefore say beware the ""Classic Reprint Series."" Still readable, but far from the print quality we spoiled Americans are accustomed to...."
3,Works ok - Directions are not all that helpful,Worked ok in my situation - directions were not that clear (which matches the unclear Johnson pocket door install instructions). Pictures are good but never the final answer. Need more verbage on how to properly install in different situations.
3,Promising but the proofreader should be demoted,"I've had the book for just over a week. I believe it will be of great help to me, someone without classical training who wants to be able to play pop music relatively well in a short period of time.Unfortunately, some of the errors in the book are quite glaring. The book uses diagrams to illustrate which keys to press on the keyboard. Within the first 23 pages, I have already come across 2 areas where the diagrams are incorrect. In the one instance on page 22, two thirds of the 24 diagrams are wrong!I have found no place on the internet to get corrections and I have seen no evidence of a revision of the book. Without these, some sections of the book will be less than useful.That said though, I still hope to gain much from this book and will continue to work my way through it as best I can. I am optimistically curious as to how well I'll play in a year's time."
5,Awesome book,"I have been using this book, on and off, for about 20 years...I have used it both as a self-tutor & for teaching others...In my opinion it is the best tutor book for someone that wants to play keyboards in a band or write songs rather than play from sheet music which is what most other tutor books do.Yes, there is an odd mistake in it and the jokes are terrible! But still the best book for the purpose out there."
4,Final Fantasy VII & VIII RPG Review,I enjoy both of these epic roleplaying games. There are so many alternate side quests and an in depth story line; this really adds to the games.These games are also a great investment. Final Fantasy VII currently goes for a hefty price and is a coveted collectible for many RPG players.I would recommend both of these games if you enjoy RPG's.
1,"If you buy this combo, you are a fool",You can get these at any used video game store for about $10.00USD. They each sold well over a million units. Supply and Demand.
1,Junk,"These tweeters are a waste. with the crossovers they produced high pitched distortion, without they sound better but still have a bad static sound. Only had 25 watts RMS ran to them."
2,Needed A Better Format,"Usually, these NFL highlight videos produce a wave of NFL nostalgia from any fans. We all love to reminisce/argue about the games/players gone by.This tape, however, is more of a ""look to the future"" than a recap of the 1998 season. I would have preferred a game-by-game approach instead of a preview for a season that will have it's own highlight video."
5,"The most relaxing ""spa"" music CD I own","When I am feeling stressed and I want to unwind, I put on this CD, light some candles, and either have a bath or meditate. This is the most amazing CD for clearing your head. It's my favorite and I have tons of other ""spa"" CDs."
5,From a youth pastors perspective,"A must for those new in the ministry and a ""should read"" for all of us old veterans. I have been on staff in a growing church for 15 and still was inspired by this book. It will respark Dreams God has put in your heart and give a direction to fulfill them. Dream, Plan and Build!!"
1,"Revolution YM, The complete guide to high-impact youth ministry","I found this book nothing more than a motivation book which could have been written by anyone in the motivational field. Why is it that we can though out a few Bible references and couch our language with churchy phrases and then call it a Christian Leadership Guide. When are we going to follow our true leader, Jesus?"
4,Resting my Bones,This Halloween piece is a great addition to my village. The lamp and pumpkins light up which I didn't realize when purchasing!
4,Great sweatshirt and T-shirt,"I bought this as a gift and I know my cousin will love it. The material is high quality and true to size. The only thing was that the orange sweatshirt was a little dark for being the true burnt orange of UT like the one in the picture. Other than that, its great."
2,Sub-standard Product,"I use my CP200 on a regular basis. My previous battery lasted for several years with regular use and charging. This battery is already acting like it doesn't take a full charge and the radio chirps after a transmission, sometimes only halfway through a shift. I am uncomfortable having to depend on this product. I will not buy it agagin."
5,Best Peg Winder,"You can only get so excited about a great peg winder, but you can get extremely PO'ed about a cheap one.Over the years I have added this Planet Waves model to more than a few of my guitar cases. It is smooth and easy to use. A couple bucks more than some others out there, but it is only a couple bucks - and it is, IMHO - the best. I highly recommend it.The black Jim Dunlop model is my second go to winder and also a quality piece."
3,Peg winder is ok,"What can you say about a peg winder?This one is nothing special, but it does do the job.Its construction is solid enough and it doesn't feel as if it's going to break or fall apart.Update: After using this to change strings a few times, I've found that the peg puller doesn't work as well. The plastic is wearing and it doesn't get under the pegs as well. It still works, but is harder to use."
2,Incongruous and puzzling,"This is a disappointing collection. Scatman Crothers only performs 4 songs on this whole disc, and they are recent numbers, not pieces from his Cotton Club heyday.Likewise the Cab Calloway material. This is Cab in the 1970's, imitating Sammy Davis Jr., doing show tunes and Vegas Lounge numbers, an entirely forgettable performance. It's not terrible, but the title is terribly misleading-- neither artist ever sounded like *this* at the Cotton Club.What was Laserlight thinking?Oh.. they were thinking they could get away with it... avoid this release."
3,kind of disappointed,"Like the music from this time, but I was looking for Scat type music and this is the same as all the other Cab Calloway songs."
3,"OK case, could be better.","Things I like:1. The screen is completely covered.2. The belt clip ratchets and has a quick-release button.3. The cut-outs line up very well with the phone.Things I don't:1. The fit is a little awkward, particularly with an extended battery.2. The clear plastic over the screen also covers the keyboard and it's so thick that the keys are harder to press than normal.3. The part of the case that buckles into the belt clip doesn't come off, so even if you just slip the phone into your pocket without the clip, it's bulkier."
2,Not useful as a european menu reader for American travelers,"I got this book with the mistaken notion that I could bring it to Europe and decipher the menus there.The problem is the book's unusual organization.Each page contains five columns of dishes in each of English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.For example:...Cabbage__Kohl_______Chou_____Cavolo____ColCarrots__Karotten____Carottes__Carote_____ZanahoriasCelery___Sellerie_____Celeris___Sedani_____ApioCress____Kresse_____Cresson__Crescione__Berro...See the problem?Is is sorted by the English word. That does not help when you have the French words, and are trying to figure out English one.Buy this book to go from English to a European language (not the reverse)."
4,A Gastronomic Traveler's Resource,"Since purchasing this book many years ago, I have had many friends and even strangers ask me where they too can get a copy. It has proved very useful and would make a great gift for a someone visiting from overseas or someone going on a trip. Many of my friends who live overseas enjoyed this book as well because it is designed by food type. So, if you are eating at a pastry shop, you do not need to sift through a dozen types of seafood or poultry to find your just desserts. There are a few foods missing in this, but they are not those which you'd usually encounter as a tourist (unless you are adventurous). I recommend this book to those who love to travel and enjoy being able to know what they are eating. This is especially valueable to anyone with food allergies, dietary restrictions or food dislikes. I learned quickly how to ask about ingredients and knew what to avoid on a menu. The book is also a nice size to fit into a purse, handbag, or backpack."
3,ISABELLA Bed Sheet Set 100% Egyptian Cotton Solid Sateen 400 Thread Count.(Lavender) Full,I purchased this set for my daughter. We like the feel and quality of the fabric. The color started fading in spots after about 5 washes. It would have rated significantly higher if the color had not faded in spots.
2,Only useful for rebuilding,"This book will hardly teach you anything about the theory of operation for the carburetors, but it is useful for rebuilding due to the detailed strip-down and rebuild procedure. There is not a single illustration explaining the principles of what is going on, and the tuning advice is trial-and-error and seat-of-pants based.Methodology for identifying which circuit to tune is not very clear. No mention is made of tuning for power and economy and what tradeoffs to make. Since wideband O2 sensors and data loggers have been available for a few hundred US$ for the last few years, one would expect a recent (2003) book to make use of them, even though they where more expensive at the time of print. Read the carburetor tuning forums at [...] instead."
4,what you see is what you get,"The book advertised and it's description on Amazon was exactly what was supplied.Helps to know what is advertised is what you get, all my transaction have been the same.Took a little longer for it to come to Australia, but we are a long way from the shores of USA,just thought with modern transport it would be a little quicker, maybe it was customs delay?"
4,"solid, informative book","I haven't finished reading the book yet, but so far I am quite pleased with it."
3,Disappointing,"Fails to mention existing Dialog Boxes that have been around since .NET 1.1. In one example shows how to make a dilog that lists all folders on the machine. I guess he didn't know about the FolderBrowserDialog.Fails to mention using the config file to store application settings and gives an example of how to store them in the registry.Makes no mention I can find regarding the project properties window where application settings can be entered.Still, the book does have good material regarding Windows forms design.I think this book uses text from an earlier book, which would explain the ommision of the items listed above."
1,More number flashing than time,"I bought this clock about 4 months ago.It malfunctions too many times since the time I bought it.The numbers start flashing, and you cannot reset the time.I have worked on this clock a couple of times, and it continues to flash.The best place for this clock is in the trash can."
1,Inaccurate - do not buy,"I've only owned one of these for two weeks, but noticed right away it was gaining time. It has gained 4 minutes in the past week. Totally unacceptable for any clock, let alone a bed side alarm clock."
1,Gains Minutes Quickly! - Do Not Buy,"As others have stated, this clock gains minutes within just a few days. It might be tolerable if it took much longer, but it's out of sync with credible sources within a few days, requiring a manual adjustment. Wholly unacceptable."
1,OLD ONE WORKS - NEW ONE DOESN'T,"Interesting, and bad. I purchased one of these Sharp clocks about six years ago, and it is precisely accurate.Two months ago, I purchased another one. The two clocks are identical. So why does this one gain over a minute each week.Recently purchased a much less expensive clock, that runs on 9 volts, and sat them together. After five weeks, the cheap clock is still absolutely accurate, and the Sharp is eight minutes fast!!Never buy a Sharp again. They should be required to take this clock off the market!!!!"
3,Fast,"This clock has a gigantic screen and bright red numbers that are easy to see even with high glare. However, it runs incredibly fast. I will set it every week, and by the next week, it is already 3-4 minutes ahead, which means I have to sit there and press the buttons 56 times every week. I have a feeling this will lead to a quick wearing out of the product."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book because I really do believe that U2 represent something very significant in terms of spirituality. I hoped the book would be as inspiring as U2 themselves or at least partly so. How wrong I was. This random collection of sermons feels like I'm stuck in high school english class listening to person after person rattle off speech after speech, wishing they were anywhere else but here. There is not a shred of revelation or conviction in any one of them. I kept reading hoping it would get better but it didn't. I'm very relieved that the people offering up these sermons are not preaching in my church. This is textbook preaching 101. Powerless and impoverished."
4,Lovely,"Overall, this animated version is a fairly faithful retelling of the 'Yamato' storyline in the Phoenix manga, with the addition of the first episode of the next story. I love the animation. It was a bit sloppy at times, but not often, and was very smooth and clean in its simpleness, and I liked the character designs. While the writing is a bit cheesy at times (especially with the quintuplet babies) this DVD is a solid piece of work and is a must for any Phoenix fan. While it wasn't as good as it could have been, I wasn't disappointed - animated or movie versions are never exactly the same as their printed versions. overall a solid 4/5 stars."
3,"Yeah, Immortality... We Get It","To read this review in its entirety please visit [...]This volume has been sitting in my review pile for weeks waiting to be reviewed. Before I put it in I asked a couple of people I know what their opinions of it were and for the most part I got some favorable reviews and while I'm not necessarily saying that this first volume was bad, I will say that I found way too many aspects of it done poorly. The writing can border on cheesy, the animation looks like something that Walt Disney dreamed up after a weekend bender and the story has left me less than impressed thus far. I'm not going to recommend it to others but if you find yourself bored with nothing else to do, this anime might help you kill a couple of hours at least until you find something better to do or watch."
3,"OK, but not great.","I bought this set because I enjoy playing Mexican Train with friends. The dominoes are not as thick as indicated; the tin came quite dented up; the score pad that was supposed to be included had been replaced by a pad of thick cardboard; and the colors of some numbers are so similar that you cannot tell them apart without counting the pips (there are too many shades of reds). The game will still be fun to play with my grandchildren, but this set does not have the quality of the one that we usually play with. I am glad that I did not buy it to give as a gift.Those things being said, it is still a good value for the price that I paid. I would have paid a bit more to get the thicker dominoes if I had known these were so thin, about 5/16 inch so that they fall over easily."
1,Not At All Worth the Money,"This is an entirely overpriced, poorly designed and inferior version of good old dominoes.The ""tin"" is just that--too flimsy too adequately hold the heavy tiles and accessories for travel.The hub is worthless, using three button batteries that were not working. When replaced, the sounds that should be heard are weak and create no excitement.The vendor has received a complaint and has not responded, even to say that they will provide no credit for any portion of the $68 purchase/shipping price.Go buy a double twelve set of dominoes and instructions for the real game, Mule Train, and forget the extras."
3,Chicken foot game pieces,"I like the game center piece a lot.I was disappointed that numbers are not ""all"" a different color. Example - 12's and 10's are both ""red"" 9's & 6's also look almost alike. There are plenty of colors to use so why make some of them the same color? This was a disappointing feature. We are use to playing with each game piece having different colors even though the dots are so course different, it was also easy to look for the colors."
5,Great game for family & friends.,We have been playing this game for several years. We had given away our previous one. Great game for family & friends. Excellant way to spend an afternoon or evening around the table. Requires strategy and a lot of luck.
3,INTRODUCING DR. KILDARE.,"In this little offering from 1937, Joel McCrea plays Doctor Jimmie Kildare who helps ex-convict Stanwyck find her missing three year-old daughter. Lloyd Nolan plays a gangster with a heart of gold whose life is saved by a crude operation performed by Kildare with the implements at hand in a barroom. True to the film's title, the young Dr. Kildare won't accept payment for exercising his surgical skills. Ridges, a not-so-nice gangster, is holding the daughter for both money and for Stanwyck herself. When Ridges is shot, Kildare must once again operate in order to save his life: otherwise the whereabouts of the young girl will go unknown; there is the expected happy ending. This Paramount picture was the first film to introduce Max Brand's fictional Dr. Kildare to the moviegoing public, he would later be played by Lew Ayres for M-G-M, and, for the 1960's television series, he was perhaps most successfully portrayed by Richard Chamberlain."
1,These speakers are HORRIBLE,"I bought these speakers thinking ""hmm... with USB i wont need a soundcard"" .. well things dont always work out like they are supposed to. Yea, you dont need a soundcard to use these speakers. What you do need is a 800000 mhz computer with a few gigs of RAM. Seriously, these things ate up so many of my computers resources that I was unable to multitask anything. I couldnt even surf the net when i was listening to music, and if i even had the things plugged in i could forget about burning a CD. I wasted 5 blank cds before i realized what my problem was. I am running a P3 800 mhz with 128 megs of ram.. i should think i have enough power to listen to music AND check my email, but with these speakers its not possible. I finally took them back and bought a Turtle beach Montigo 2 Quadzilla soundcard and Some AWESOME monsoon flat panel speakers.. save yourself some greif and stay away from the yamaha USB speakers."
2,medocre read,kinda bland. i never really felt any connection building with this couple. it would have been nice to have been inside the hero's head a little more.
2,Dull read,"Perhaps its me but I generally find DC offerings extremely staid. This is not true of Dave Gibbons The Watchmen, an excellent comic by any standards.So I come into this comic expecting something similar from Gibbons. The art is really quite attractive, a sort of Zot like style comparable to the Watchmen. However, the story is predictably dull. Two arch villains, Luthor and The Joker, decide to trade territories Metropolis and Gotham City respectively, in order to confound their respective arch-nemeses Superman and Batman. Naturally, the good guys have to respectively trade their territories in order to deal with their respective nemeses. There are panels placed side by side in order to show comparatively how Supes and Batman would deal with their situations respectively.I respectfully submit this very dull critique of a very dull comic."
5,I saw him live,"One time me and my friends were in a bookstore called Mona Lisait in Paris, and the song Integration was playing over the speakers. it's really catchy so we asked who the artist was and they showed us Anis' cd. when i went back to Rennes, where i was living, i saw all these posters for an Anis concert. i had bought the CD and i love it. i went to see him live, and i have nothing but good memories associated with his music. It's really good 'variete francaise'. it's not rock or pop really....but i love this cd."
2,unless you have to,"..not really worth it. I'm an anthropologist, and have had my share of heavy fieldwork studies. But this one is tedious and not particularly original. If you must, read it. My copy only got read in bits and with effort."
4,Hey it's much better than I thought.,"""The Enemy"" was surprisingly enjoyable to me. The cast was cool and the plot was good (dealing with a somewhat up-to-date terror of biochemical weapons). It was nice to find Horst Buchholz (The Magnificent Seven) still handsome after long years. Olivia d'Abo (Conan the Destroyer) undoubtedly put on some weight but remained a feast to the eyes (especially in the steaming albeit short love scene). Luke Perry was adorable and smart. Add up Roger Moore if you don't expect as much from him as in a James Bond thriller. This movie deserves 4 stars compared to several big budgeted thrillers that got people so hyped up first then disappointed later."
4,Decent movie (in 1.77:1 anamorphic),"The Lions Gate 2001 release says it is 1.33:1 full frame. It is not. It is 1.77:1 anamorphic. This looks to be the correct aspect ratio too. Nothing seems to be cut off.The movie It'self is quite good for a lower budjet flick. Olivia Makes it, although the ""almost"" love scene was cut short."
4,Nice,"This is the best releasing shaped pan I have purchased. There were a couple places that stuck but that was the user not the product, be sure grease/flour pan thoroughly."
2,"pan looks great, but the cake not so much","A few things to know:- deeper and narrower than most bund cake pans- pan lines are awesome on the outside, but they don't translate well into the cakeI wanted my cake to look like the pan, but it did't happen. I bake only at Christmas,and while these cakes come out nice...they aren't show stoppers like:Nordic Ware Platinum Collection Kugelhopf Bundt Pan"
5,Want to impress your guests? Use this amazing pan!,"Here's an impressive bunt pan for sure.The non stick coating is really good, because even that complicated shape comes out really easily when you spray down the pan with cooking oil spray. The pan has worked for us every time we've made a cake in it. The cake comes out evenly baked, and just drops right out of the pan when you turn it over.The cake looks really impressive too, so it's perfect to bake in when you're having guests. Nobody expects that really fancy shape, so when you bring it out & set it on the table, it's a real treat!"
5,counter better than digital,"While digital micrometers are about as expensive as the counter type, I prefer the counter. Anything that requires a battery nowadays just doesn't seem to last as long as you need it, so I take this (supposedly) American made product anytime. (In the MSC catalog, it listed import as one choice and Fowler as another, so I'm assuming that this was made in America, although it's hard to really find out, since so many American suppliers are starting to use China)"
5,series of broadcasts: fascinating,"Wonderful video explaining and showing the history of India - starting from almost 1,000 years ago. It includes migration, silk trade, written history on metal in Temples, archeology, religion, unbelievable metal work done, astrology, development of modern math...and so much more. Seen on my Kindle Fire HD - WOW."
1,Boring and biased,Put together by a western 'India-phile' the boring and biased viewpoint of the author is distracting from the beauty and fascination of India. The movie makes the feeling anti-western rather than pro Indian.
5,Great for students,This is an excellent film for students. Good details about the customs and traditions of India. It will supplement any textbook.
2,Don't get your lesson in Indian Religion here.,"This is a great documentary, excepting two primary problems. 1: It makes Indians look like some sort of primitive, sub-human species. 2: The explanations of religion are way off. Brahminism was brought by the Vedic Aryan people from the north, not the natives of the south as the documentary seems to express."
5,Absolutely Magnificent,"Having seen two of the six episodes on TV in January, I waited in eager anticipation for the Blu-ray release in mid-April. Well worth the wait, the Blue-ray disk, when displayed on a 1080p wide screen monitor, must be one of the best reasons to buy Blu-ray and HD TV equipment. I have enjoyed the series so much, I've watched it three times during the five weeks since I got it. Anyone with an interest in India will enjoy it on one level or another. Well done!"
5,Excellent documentary on India,Michael Wood and his company has done an excellent job of showing story of India in 1080P HD as that's what showed on my plasma tv vs. Nature greatest moments. Highly recommend it. 6 hrs are worth spending on rich culture and its history including various religions and their impact on India.
3,India 101 for beginners,"History of IndiaI had never known that such a production existed until a family member mentioned it over the phone. I was curious to see how it actually was made and the name BBC made it even more enticing to watch. It seems BBC has done a fine job as a refresher course on India or as a supplement to anyone doing a brief survey on India. If you have never been to India and are not familiar with its history, this video is a great beginning. Michael Wood is very enthusiastic and takes us too many remote places even Indians would not like to go. The music is OK and I just have a single grouse and that is that the film clippings that they used in the movie could have been better selected but a fine effort it is nevertheless to cover the entire survey on India in two parts. I gave it three stars 121509"
5,The Story of India,A wonderful history of India. I was not aware of the beginings of the country. This documentary was worth seeing and learning.
4,Very well done,"It was nicely balanced history of an ancient culture. It could have been longer and dug deeper into this rich story, but for what it was , it did the job nicely."
5,"Absolute must watch -10,000 years of history in 6 hours","If you thought you knew something about the history of Asia... you ain't seen nothing yet.This fantastic tour through time from the earliest civilizations is an eye opener, not mention beautifully filmed and comfortably narrated.get it - watch it with your family and friends."
5,Maybe the best Blu-Ray out there,I'm suprised this hasn't been reviewed sonoer. This might be one of the best Blu-Ray experiences out there in terns of picture qaulity. Buy it even if you care nothing about history. Its a definate add to the library of a videophile. Audio is also in DTS Master Audio.
4,"Pretty good, but could have been done better.","This series is very informative, beautifully shot, and interesting, but watch for some things that are overstated. Sometimes it will proceed to say that India has the oldest this or that, or other such things when plenty of historians would disagree with such warrants. It also discusses religions in an exotica sense rather than actually telling much about the religions sometimes (other times, it gives a decent synopsis). However, given that they could only cover so much, it is wonderful what PBS has produced, and I have enjoyed the series a lot."
3,Interesting but focus,It was interesting but all over the place. It got boring after I lost track of where they were going. Although it's good for making the audience curious about India.
3,"OK, but too much about Michael Woods","After reading good reviews and receiving multiple recommendations, I was expecting more out of this documentary. It is not so much ""The Story of India"" as it is ""Michael Woods (Explores India)."" I was amazed at how much the series revolved around him--he was almost never not in the frame. If you find him a little cloying, as I did, this is not a plus. Furthermore, he uses the experts he speaks with more as a sounding board for what he already thinks, which is also annoying. Overall, the documentary is a decent overview of India but could have been far better if it was less about Michael Woods."
4,Colonial Times to Independence,"This exceptional PBS series wraps up with a look at India, from the mid 1700's through modern times. Focusing on British colonial rule, Indian uprisings, Ghandi and Nehru, as well as the partition, the conflict and the challenges faced by modern India and Pakistan. The information provided and the approach is solid, with great cinematography. Following a viewing, the interested viewer will have a good idea of both the challenges and history of the India-Pakistan conflict, as well as the hopes and desires for the potential of a reunited India."
1,Another addition to the biased documentaries,"Not want to add more to what has already been pointed out correctly by others. This documentary is totally biased and shows incorrect truth about the History of India.Please stay away from this documentary, would recommend spending the money on charity rather than spending on buying this DVD."
1,Another ethnocentric poorly scripted faux-documentary,"This is a churlish production full of ethnocentrism, insulting interviewing style, presumptuous conclusions, wandering nonsensical monologuing, absolutist propositions, amateur shooting and terrible cut-scenes. Garbage in HD is still garbage. This video is nothing short of an affront to anthropology at large and science in general. It has permanently soured me on Michael Wood."
4,India in 1080i,"A great show, but sadly NOT 1080P. It seems PBS spent the money on the DTS HD sound track rather than the video quality. This is apparent when there is fast panning, but over all still very watchable and very informative."
5,"Lively, involving, informative, illustrated, reader friendly","This survey of architecture and theology examines London church structures built by Hawksmoor from 1712-1731. From a review of the architect's education and designs to church politics and issues in structures, Hawksmoor's London Churches: Architecture and Theology provides a lively, involving account with plenty of color photos."
4,Space shuttle model,I am currently working on the Minicraft Space shuttle model and it is going very well. The pieces fit together perfectly. I am about to start painting of which I will use the Shuttle Endeavour features. I would recommend this model to anyone.
5,Reed & Barton Dorado Flatware,"Awsome purchase!! Lots of homework for this purchase - great product, great feel, fantastic price value! Thanks again, Amazon."
5,Excellent Toy,This gym is such a wonderful developmental toy. It's soft and adorable. Tiny Love has so many wonderful products and a comprehensive online information about their products. Babies benefit mentally and physically from this gym. Highly recommended.
5,Great gift,"This was a gift for my wife. While slightly pricey, it is beautiful item and she truly loves it."
3,Cujo,"I read Cujo a few months ago, and this was my first King novel. Where the story was quite weak and a little boring at times, King makes up for with great writing. I'll definitely continue reading King."
3,mars 25 1999,it was not realy his best book. Some parts were kind of boring but i liked most of it. I can still imagine Cujo close to me when I'm in the basement!
5,A Real Scarer,Cujo is a frightening book about a poor boy and his mother being trapped in their broken down Pinto and being terrorized by a rabid St. Bernard. It is very scary and could give nightmares to many gullible people. I would not recommend this book to anyone who has a large dog.
4,A good and thought-out book!,"Cujo is so well-paced and scary that people tend to read it quickly, so they mostly remember the scene of the mother and son trapped in the hot Pinto and threatened by the rabid Cujo, forgetting the multifaceted story in which that scene is embedded. This is definitely a novel that rewards re-reading. When you read it again, you can pay more attention to the theme of country folk vs. city folk; the parallel marriage conflicts of the Cambers vs. the Trentons; the poignancy of the amiable St. Bernard (yes, the breed choice is just right) infected by a brain-destroying virus that makes it into a monster; and the way the ""daylight burial"" of the failed ad campaign is reflected in the sunlit Pinto that becomes a coffin. And how significant it is that this horror tale is not supernatural: it's as real as junk food, a failing marriage, a broken-down car, or a fatal virus."
4,Great read.. however,"Great easy fast read.. I love his ""movie"" books so much more than the movie itself. However just be warned, there are some errors in this kindle version. I am new to Kindle books not sure if this is the norm or not, its nothing you can't get over just slightly annoying. So if by chance you have the hardback, and are thinking of also adding this book to your Kindle, pass.Oh I really suggest THE LONG WALK by SK if you havent read that yet, Don't really read what its about, just jump right into it! SOO AWESOME!!!"
2,I remember the movie being scarier,"I guess I was expecting more having just read Salem's Lot, but I was not happy with this book. In my opinion it is not one of King's stronger works. It seemed to drag on and there were lots of events that seemed pointless to the story. It seemed a lot of this book was written just to fill space. I am glad I have read it and can move on but really don't have much to say about this book other than I was not happy with it. It was however, better than Lisey's Story."
4,U should read this book,A great bookSuper fantastic and very descriptive on several parts of this amazing book by Stephen king. I recommend this book
3,would've been better if it was a rabid t cup chihuahua,"This book only requires finishing because of the cute little boy. If it hadn't been for him, I don't think I could have forced myself to care about anyone in this book. The mother is a shallow bimbo who locks herself in a car with her dying kid and only finally takes action at the end. The horror element isn't really there. The father is lame and doesn't pay any attention to what is right in front of his face. I kept waiting for the usual SK carnage to begin, where everything goes crazy and pulls you into another world, but this time it just didn't happen. You could always see what was coming next in this book and I really hate it when that happens. It wasn't awful, I have to admit though, I was rooting for the dog!"
4,Not one of King's best,"I have read ""Cujo,"" ""The Green Mile,"" ""Christine,"" ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,"" and ""The Gunslinger."" This is a pretty intriguing story (kind of boring at times, but usually pretty interesting), but it focuses way too much on the back story. If you are looking to read this book for big action with the dog, you'll be disappointed. This book takes the family's problems and watches them escalate up until the climax, where when everything is getting to its worst, the dog attacks. King seems to forget what the book is about and forget to check on the dog for 70-90 pages. He was having a drinking problem when he wrote this book, which might explain why the book is sort of brutal and messy. If you're a King fan read this book, if you're a King beginner, read some of his better books first."
2,family dog gone rabid,"this book was probably having its golden age when people more feared rabies. that was before my time though, so perhaps i couldn't relate. i never saw what was so great about this work. a family has a big dog. the dog gets bitten by rabies-infected bats. in the end it becomes a treath to a family that seem to be unable to escape. ok. the suspence wasn't that much, that is what i consider to be the greatest flaw. never been much for ""people standing around trying to make a stand""- plots. but the way K describes cujo's mind, as it goes through the phases of rabies, and how it considers things, is the book's real greatness. this was between 2 and 3 stars. a little too dull for my taste"
4,Cujo. The book,"Cujo is a dog who turns savage when he gets bitten by a wild bat.As a result of this fatal bite Cujo has uncontrollable rages of anger that he inflicts upon his owners and anyone in his path, eventually creating the terror that becomes the focus of this bone crunching story. When I listened to the part of the story that talked about how Cujo was bitten,I was reminded of the wolfman where a man gets bitten by a werewolf and becomes one.In this story we have a domestic animal that gets bitten by a wild animal then becomes a wild uncontrollable animal himself.Written by Steven Dart"
2,The movie was actually better,"I remember watching the movie with a boyfriend back in high school. The movie wasn't that scary and I wasn't interested in reading any of Stephen King books. However, that changed a couple of years ago when I finally decided to read IT. I lucked out and found some King books at a used bookstore and one of those was Cujo. I was excited to read the book and settled in one night. However, shortly after getting started I realized this book is not up to the standards of his other books. The typical horror felt in It was nowhere to be found. When I read IT I admit I had moments when I was frightened... Cujo however was just a book about a rabid dog nothing more. Fortunately I know there are more King books out there that are still awesome like Salem's Lot and The Shining (not scary but a good read). I suggest skipping this book unless one is doing a comparison to King writings...."
3,Cujo Review,"by Bryce B.The plot of this book was that a big dog a Saint Bernard named Cujo. The dog gets scratched by a bat and gets rabies. The dog goes ""insane"" and starts attacking people in the town of Castle Rock, Marine which that's where the story takes place. If I had to recommend this book I would say that it kind of ""drags on"". The story doesn't get good till about page 100. The best scene is when the son and the mom get stuck in their Ford Pinto. The boy and his mom drive to Camber's place the owners of Cujo and their car brakes down then out of nowhere Cujo jumps at the car and tries to get in but cant. The mom thinks of running inside and call the police but if she cant out run the dog she'll be eaten! Will the she make it to the house in time?"
4,cujo,"This is a great work of horror, king expresses the feelings of the characters and their struggles beautifully. Although i must admit the best part of the book has to be the last 50 pages or so, when the child and mother are about at the breaking point with cujo and must escape. There are a couple of little twists and turns to make it interesting. Overall i thought the book was great."
5,AWSOME,"This book is Awsome!!!!! Mr. Stephen King, (Though Dosen't remember it) has written a great book of supernatrural horro that seems to hold true in the world were we live. It was also one of the best endings of any book that I have ever read. Pick it up and read it with the lights on and the windows up. Man's best friend has become your worst nightmare!"
3,a little slow,the book was very slow in the beginning. you don't even get into the action until about page 125. then it is slow for a while then the action starts again. I think it is one of the worse I have read of stephen kings books.
2,gud bok,this wuz a neeto bok. u shud reed iit.. tarzen like bok. FIRE BAD! errrrrghh! ME AM KINGGGGGG
4,Heres a very interesting book.,"The book had my interest from the start and from the end.It really grabbed my attention in the first part where a high action took place.I was hooked from that point on.When the high action takes place is when, Cujo, the dog who has rabbies which makes him crazy is getting closer and closer to Tad Trenton's bed each night. Tad, the young boy, cries every night and tryes to tell his parents but they dont believe him.You, as the reader, will be surprised how fast you will be involed with the book in the beginning and will be hooked from that point with the rest of the book.The theme is not to belive everything you hear like there is no ""monster"" in your closet.In conclusion, I would recomened this book to everyone, especially those who enjoy lots of action."
4,pretty good,cujo was a pretty good book if you are looking for a not so scary but all togeather good book to read but if you are looking for a book that will totaly scare you and keep you up all night I would not reccomend this book to you
5,Best of Stephen King...,"I have read some of Stephen Kings books such as Firestarter, The Stand, and The Shining, and I have to say this is the best of the best, to me. It was so scary that I could not put it down. I was scared of my own dog for a couple of days after I read the book. If you enjoy most of Stephen Kings work than you will enjoy Cujo, by Stephen King."
2,Huh???,"I had the same reaction upon reaching the end of this novel as I did with a later work of his - Gerald's Game. Namely, huh??? Or to be more precise, that's it?? Cujo reads like a premise for a short story that King, with his usual expansive style, manages to expand into a novel. Too much seemed contrived - like the monster in the closet in the opening chapters - and the Castle Rock stuff felt like it got tacked on to add another fifty pages. In reading Cujo you're slogging to the conclusion, rather than accelerating. Not recommended"
5,Grrrrr.....,"Great book by King. Nothing supernatural about this, but it's still roaringly good. I agree with the person that wrote in from monkeybat@worldnet.att.net. This is more of a tragedy than a horror book. After all, poor old Cujo didn't ask to be infected with rabies! Good book, though"
4,"Excellent writing, but more disturbing than scary","This book was very original, but it was scary for about the last 25 pages"
3,Another good book,"He hooks your interest in the beginning and drags you to the end! As all of his other books, Cujo is full of detail, sometimes to me too boring, but I love the way he does the omniscient point of view... the way one person's time and place leads into another person's critical situation. He weaves an interesting plot, and I love how he did Cujo's point of view. Neat. BUT, the only thing I did not like about the book is that Tadder died. I read such a description that I ended up liking Tad's innocence and wishing totally that he'd be ok, but he ended up dead! Ah well, at least Kemp got caught..."
2,Best to be read with a 2 pots of coffee,"Like most people, I think, I read this book long after I saw the movie. Though I can't really remember what the movie was like, I wish I could forget the book just the same. This has to be the biggest let-down of all the books I've read from King. I only finished it because I had already commited myself after the first few hundred pages. It started out really great, but it kept dragging on....and on.....and on..... Sorry Stephen, but you could have scratched all the boring character backgrounds- job/life/relationship crap and focused more on Cujo and his little problem. You could have done all this and put it in Skeleton Crew or Night Shift as a short story. I also expected way more horrific attacks from Cujo. The whole (being trapped in the car) scene was way too drawn out and the ending sucked big-time. If your looking to read a good novel about a dog, read ""Benji""....."
2,Not his best,"Cujo wasn't a good book. King had a good idea about a rabid dog, but he limits his attacks. I expected Cujo to have a rampage through Castle Rock and attack many people. Instead, he limits it to just 3 or 4 people. And half the novel is spent with other charactors and places. Cujo is alright for a light read or if nothing else is availible, but The Green Mile and Diffferent Seasons are much better."
2,Not up 2 expectations,"Cujo started out as an interesting book with it's frightening parts, but as the book went on, Stephen King seemed 2 have lost his writing passion and the rest just wasn't scarry and was somewhat boring."
4,"Exciting, but tedious at times","I've enjoyed reading some of King's work, but this is by no means one of his best. Although the premise of the story was good and kept me wondering what was going to happen next, I felt that some sections were overly detailed and at times tedious; I don't feel like reading long descriptions of scenery when I'm sitting on the edge of my seat wondering what's going to happen next in the story.Overall, not bad. I recommend Cujo to people new to King's work because it's not overly gruesome like some of his others but still retains his unique flair."
3,BOOOrinnggggggggg....,The begining was reaaally boring I had to skip pages cause I was falling asleep. But at the end it was picking up and was becoming more interesting. Stephen King has definately written better...
4,Starts slow but is worth the wait.,"I have two veiws on this book. I really like the over all book but in the begining it was very slow. Cujo is not a book for younger children. There are very strong words and very good descriptive adjectives in this book. That is one of it's best qualities though. I would recomend this book for anyone that likes horror books and suspence books. The way Stephen King wrote this is a way to keep you interested. He accually explained how the dog was thinking, he got into it's mind. In my opinion that takes a real writer to do that. Once I started I just could not put the book down. Over all this book was one of the better books of Stephen King."
2,Yawn yamn yawn ...,"Sorry; I'm one of those who'll pick up a book by an author I like and read it regardless of the order the books were published. I read this one AFTER Gerald's Game, and thought at first that there would be similarities; you know, like a slow build up to an extraordinary ending and just an overall tremendous satisfaction. But it wasn't! Cujo bites, if you'll forgive me! I'm still trying to figure out the relevance to the opening ""monster in the closet"", and the book changes scenery and thickens plot about as much as a first grade level story book (See Cujo run, See Cujo jump and bite that guy's head off ... end of story!). The only thing that added weight to my star-rating was the intricate channel King took through the mind of the dog (an interesting, King-like sentiment). So, if you're looking for a quick, blah, single-very-visible point read, this is King answering your plea. If you're looking for a typical fulfilling King novel, try firestarter or something else!"
2,Horror was OK but story line for it was bad,"The story was damn dragging with family ties and business prospects brought in meaninglessly. I couldn't find the relation between Frank Dodd's monster, the boy's dreams and Cujo. Only part I felt like reading was from when the mother and the child were trapped in the Pinto."
2,Storyline All Over the Place,"I find some of King's works hit or miss. Cujo was a big miss for me. The story line was all over the place. The main story line focused on the rabid dog, but there were sub plots that I fealt had little to do with the story if anything at all. It was a miserable reading experience to get caught up with the trapped duo in the car being terrorized by Cujo, then the story cuts over to the husband's business trip. It had me thinking, ""What? Why? Who cares?"". There's a slimeball character in the story also, but why he was in there, I don't know. The whole thing seemed hodge podge and vast parts irrelevant. I just couldn't finish it, I skimmed the last third of the story.I tend to like King's longer books like ""It"", ""Under the Dome"", and ""The Stand"". I've been disappointed before by some of his short stories and shorter novels."
2,Weak sauce,"Cujo is definitely my least-favorite King book except for ""Under the Dome"". Way too much in-depth detail on characters that don't matter, not enough actual flesh to the story. Wish I'd skipped it."
3,"Overdrawn soap opera, but with suspenseful ending","This tale would have made a wonderful short story/novella/Twilight Zone episode, but the drawn out novel becomes tedious. We learn endlessly about the characters, although they don't actually do much. The ending of the novel is when it kicks into high gear, and shows why this would have been a better short story. The only reason this is novel length is the overdrawn character studies. I read this as a kid when I was much more forgiving, and I loved it. Looking back, most of the novel verges on soap opera theatrics: infidelity, domestic and work troubles, disgruntled lovers, even winning the lottery! Way too much going on here."
3,Not his best.,"I was big fan of King's horror in my youth and I'd have to say that 'IT' and 'Salem's Lot' are 2 of the scariest books I've ever read (and I read a lot!). Stephen King was one of the authors who whet my book appetite and his were among my first real adult books. However, as has been mentioned in an earlier review, Cujo doesn't really slot into the 'horror' genre for me and I found it to be a bit of a let down overall. It was a good story, told by a master storyteller but it's not his best.If this is the first book of King's that anyone is reading, this is by no means indicative of his talents and while it's a good story, don't judge him on this book alone."
3,Typical of most Stephen King books,Generally I find Kings books to be ok as far as casual entertainment but they tend to be dumbed down for mass consumption. Being that I tend to be a sucker for any book involving dogs I thought Cujo might transcend beyond the level of mildly entertaining light reading. It turned out to be a disappointment. The story in a nutshell is about a rabid Saint Bernard and the havoc he wreaks. Like I said its ok as far as casual entertainment but if your looking for a great or even very good book don't bother.
1,Ooops!,"I have, within the last couple of years, become a huge Stephen King fan, but with being in college and all, I don't have much time to read his books anymore. But, if I do ever get time, I hope I don't read one of his books that is this pointless again. Stephen King, I want my money back. Just kidding. Don't save this for a rainy day; save it for your death bed when you feel like a laugh."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"If you had to pick a sick, rabid dog to be terrorising you, I am pretty sure that a Saint Bernard would be really really low on a lot of people's list, down near Rottweiler, German Shepherd, Doberman, etc.The woman and kid in this book have the misfortune of being cornered by such an unfortunate beast."
2,its a bookclub book :(,"I bought this book as a gift for my grandson, only because he wanted Cujo. I didn't realize this particular book was a bookclub edition or I would not have purchased it. The pages are uneven, hence, the cheap price, when they are originally sold to the book club members. Well live and learn. I will be far more careful from this point on. Its true, let the buyer be ware! Unhappy grandmother."
5,Cujo!!,"Ok.... I am in the middle of the book and all I have to say is this book is creepy. The atmosphere it sets for you in Castle Rock is beyond words. Its not that scary when your reading it, but once your alone and you think about all the connections in the book, IT FREAKS YOU OUT!!!!!"
4,Extremely frightening ...,I can't think of a better word that everyone else hasn't used yet. This is the master of Horror at his best!
5,cujo,"I THINK THAT STEPHEN KING'S CUJO SHOULD HAVE A FIVE STAR RAITING ANDBE A TWO THUMBS UP BOOK. IT'S GOOD WITH PLENTY OF SUSPENCE; BUT, WITHA LITTLE INAPPROPRIATE SEX. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND UP... END"
2,King's 41st of 41,"King has 33 books, not counting collections, 41 counting 4 past midnight and 4 seasons. This is his worst. Save it for when you have nothing else to read of King's, you may appreciate it a little better."
2,Cujo book,The book that i was expecting was not the same one that was received... the book on the screen is much more new and in better shape than the one that i received... i was not happy to be receiving a book older than me.... i wanted a much more newer and updated book with the same title...
3,Get out the Monster Words!,"So if you need more proof that Stephen King doesn't just write about haunted hotels or boogeymen, pick up Cujo. He manages to write a great book (and it's short too, just over 300 pages)where the ""monster"" is a rabid Saint Bernard named Cujo. What's also great about the book is King continuing to write rich characters, with backgrounds and personalities. I read a lot and I still find that he is one of the best writers when it comes to creating memorable characters. This book is quick, to the point and still pretty scary. I guess the scariest part is the fact that the story is so plausible. Read it. But only if you don't have a Saint Bernard, because I don't think you'll look at him the same way again!"
4,WELL......,"I'm not saying Cujo was bad or anything, the idea of linking a rabid dog with a murderer is pathetic. I read a few books by Stephen King before this and I thought that this was too REAL, well Cujo was. I really enjoyed the description given on Cujo."
5,"JAWS has fur, and walks on four legs","Old Yeller fades in comparison, Cujo's not just loco, he's smart, and wants YOU"
2,"Woof,woof. That's dog talk for ""boring.""","I have come to expect more of Stephen King.Cujo (the book) was disappointing and boring.This isn't horror. This is crud.What's the point of a mean and rabid Saint Bernard? It's like a having a live and biting doormat. What's the point?What else can I say? Stephen King blew it withthe movie,too. The book stunk,the movie stunk.A package deal.Don't waste your money and time with Cujo"
5,Nice Job,"Although not King's best Cujo is still a great read! It is about a dog named Cujo that becomes rabid and attacks the town of Castle Rock. He traps a mother and son in the mother's Pinto for days. With a great plot and storyline this book is really great and any King fan would love it. The only thing about the book that I did not like is the characters. What was really cool about this book is that you actually get to read Cujo's point of view on everything. In conclusin, read this book for a great read but don't except a whole lot of horror in this little book. Happy Reading!"
3,Dark Novel with No supernatural elements,"Cujo is a dark novel that becomes very claustrophobic in the end. It is a good book, and despite it being by Stephen King, there is no element of supernatural terror here. Just a well written drama about a family, and a Saint Bernard who chases a rabbit into a hole and finds something bad in there."
2,Otherwise engrossing book is brought down by boring subplots,"After hearing about how scary and suspenseful Stephen King's books are supposed to be, I decided to check one out and see. Apparently I picked the wrong one.In fact, it was so boring in the beginning and throughout most of the book that the only thing keeping me from putting it down was the threat of a failing grade in my English class. Just the exposition of the book seems to last 300 pages. And on top of that, it is filled with useless and uninteresting side stories that don't all fit together but instead give the book the feeling of being either unfinished or un-edited. The only redeeming quality of the book is the last part where the woman and her son are trapped in their broken-down Pinto for days by a rabid Saint Bernard. Personally, I thought the movie was much better."
4,A realistic tale of terror!,"Cujo is perhaps not King's best novel but it is definitely an enjoyable and frightening read. King sticks to more realistic terrors in this story of a St. Bernard who contracts rabies and terrorizes a woman and her young son, keeping them trapped in a car that refuses to start for several agonizing days in sweltering summer heat. King shows us not only Donna and Tad Trenton's horror at being held ""hostage"" but also lets us into Cujo's own mind, showing us his confusion and sickness. One feels almost sorry for Cujo and we get a glimpse of him not as a monster as Donna and Tad come to see him but rather as the sick and suffering creature that he is. Even though you feel some of Cujo's emotions, you will keep turning pages to see if Tad and Donna will survive their ordeal. Definitely worth reading"
2,Riddled with Typos,"Cujo is classic Stephen King and ordinarily I'd give it four stars, but this ebook version is so riddled with typos it takes away from the enjoyment of the story.Typos like the frequent ""Vie"" for ""Vic"" and ""rll"" for ""I'll"" and ""Helpl"" for ""Help!""The book appears to have been converted digitally via OCR and then badly proofread. You'd expect a major publisher to take more care with its ebooks than this. It's an embarrassment to Signet / New American Library / Penguin Group (US)."
4,On edge,Older read but very enjoyable... Love suspense! I watched the movie years ago but as usual the movie was not as good as the book.
4,"Not as good as ""the Shining"".","Doesn't live up to how good the Shining was, but still a good read. I like this book it's basically just Jaws with a Saint Bernard with rabies. Just make sure you don't have a nonvaccinated Saint Bernard at your house!"
4,Great suspense,"I liked this book a lot, but was expecting something more, well... gory and grotisque. It had unbeleivable suspense and a great ending. It is about a dog that has gone rabid, terrorizing a town. It isn't that scary, but more intense and suspenseful.I thought it was a little boring at some parts, or a lot boring. But everthing else was great, and I think you should get it."
4,cujo,This is one of the better King books that I have read.It was very gripping and I literally found it hard to put down until I had read the last page.The entire section where Donna and Tad were trapped in the car reminded me a lot of 'Gearlds Game' where the wife was trapped in the holiday home.If you havn't already read this then read it now.
5,Must-Read For King and Horror Fans,"Speaking from personal experience, being attacked by a big dog is terrifying -- and so is this book! Probably one of King's best works, certainly one of his scariest. I highly recommend this to all King fans, if you have not already read it, and to horror fans."
2,not a reason why i am huge KING fan.......,"ok well CUJO, CARRIE, SHINING, MISERY are some of STEPHEN KINGS hugely succesfull books that has SPOILER in the title itself........welll CUJO about a MAD DOG...SHINING about a MAD MAN....Misery About a MAD NURSE...........Carrie-------well do u have to guess???????anyways dispite it all i read CUJO and i must say it is a well written book with tht scary dog pouncing each and every monment........the climax is superb with the baseball bat........the horror is good but nothing supernatural here......just a mad dog thts all.........if u read the book i guess gtheres no need to watch the movie........but if u watch the movie i guess the book is ruined for you..........all in all, dispite the fact this is a very well written book with such horrifying gruesomeness in every page.......this aint my cup of tea.......i need more than a CAR and a DOG to make a GREAT READ!!!!!!!!2/5"
2,BORINGEST BOOK IVE EVER READ!!!,I don't know why people say this book is so scary. ITS SO BORING!! Stephen King would never stop talking about the husband's job.It was so slow moving. It's not exciting at all...Cujo is just a waist of your time!
2,Eh... not so good.,"I only give two stars as the book was poorly written and the editing terrible. To add to that, the author never really address recording EVP/ITC. When I went to investigate the website listed in the book, that wasn't working and looks to be no longer up. There are much better books on EVP/ITC available. Check out Tom & Lisa Butler's work, Mark Macy, or better yet, Sarah Estep's work."
3,Author in Serious Need of an Editor,"This was a rough one to get through. I was expecting a thorough explanation of how EVPs were gathered, analyzed, and ideas as to what they may be. I got some of that, in various pieces, but I really wish an editor was involved to take out some of the silly quips the author made throughout the book.All in all, not the quality I was hoping for."
3,Totem Poles: An Altitude SuperGuide,There are nice photos in this book. I wasn't crazy about the way the book was organized. It is broken up in little chucks of imformation. It just wasn't easy to get through.
2,Cheap Watch,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew, thinking it would be a good first watch for him. It was extremely cheap quality and didn't even come with a battery! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, guess I got what I paid for when it comes to a watch."
5,The classic red riding hood tale,"The drawings in this book are clear and detailed. The wolf is scary, so much so that I might not show it to a young toddler. But the tale is just right, coplete with ""what big eyes you have,"" etc. The hunter has an axe, the book says he kills the wolf, but the wolf is shown just lying on its back with its eyes closed."
4,MUTTS THE MATADOR?,"BOOBS IN ARMS (1940) - This short holds a special place in my heart, because it's my favorite Three Stooges short of all time. I love this short, because it's excellent from beginning to end. A very fast-paced short, and Curly's at his best in the marching scenes. The ending with the boys being blown with laughing gas is the most funniest and outrageous Three Stooges ending ever. I never get tired of this.MUTTS TO YOU (1938) is a bad short. I never really liked any of the ""baby"" shorts the boys did, and that goes for this one as well. There aren't a lot of funny scenes, and for the most part, it's a pretty boring short.WHAT'S THE MATADOR? (1942) - A pretty good short. The best part is the second half with the Matador act - Curly is hilarious as the matador, and the ending is great, too.Great tape, with only one weak short, but I still recommend it."
1,Same old calendar year after year -- VERY AVERAGE!,"Sport Illustrated calendars feature high profile models year after year, yet the images are not as spectacular as you would imagine they should or could be. A very average calendar, definitely not the best one on the market anymore."
5,A great book,For anyone that wants to know how to make great ads this book is a must have. Great for beginers and experts as well. It is hard to find good books on advertising and this one I recomend. It is very easy to read and understand and contains great information on all aspects of advertising.
5,One of the best books on advertising.,"I have a huge library of books on advertising and copywriting, and I have to say, that this is one of my favorite books of all.This and Hey Whipple top my list, although this is written more of in a textbook format than the other book. I can't understand why that other teenage review would give a negative review of this book, especially if he didn't understand it. Teenagers know everything, and when they don't understand something they put it down I guess.Either way I can't stress enough how much i've learned from this book. It's a must-have, I repeat must-have if you are working in advertising today."
5,So good I won't resell it.,"I'm going to keep this forever just because it is so good, great content, and well organized. I'm not an advertising major, but I am self-employed so it provides lots of things I might not take into consideration now OR later. Great book for business people and self-employed even if you are not an advertising major."
4,Great book for those who are advertisers,"It's a great book for those who are advertisers or students who are studying advertising. The book is filled with colorful ads that help defend what the text is saying. It is very resourceful and beneficial in all aspects of advertising, from print ads and campaigns to television and radio commercial spots. I recommend it."
3,favorite when I was a kid,"This was by far the favorite TV series I remember from when I was a kid. I have not (re)viewed many episodes yet, but I can say I am surprised of the quality of the product. Subject is mostly not childish at all, and though sometimes really ""hard core"" cold war (those were the times, weren't they), some other times the treatment of subjects like nuclear catastrophe and military idiocy are suprising. Other ""cloak and dagger"" episodes are, of course idiotic. But image quality is good, acting also, props etc. good.More than nostalgy!"
2,Oh Judy,"I just got Volume 2 in the mail and must say that I am disappointed by the product. I bought volume one when it came out a few months back, the packaging for both volumes are totally different! Volume 1 is in a thin case.. while Volume 2 is in a standard plastic case. The quality of the sound is AMAZING but the new transfer is a bit shoddy and there a times when the image looks ""digital"".. gone is the dreamy soft quality of the previous releases. Also, I am a bit confused by the release order on these discs. The Pioneer releases are in chronological order.. these new volumes are not. And there is hardly any written info included with these disks.. the copy on the back of the DVD case is mere filler regarding Judy's life.. nothing regarding the show. All in all these shows are nice to listen to.. sometimes good to look at.. but they cut the wonder that is Judy short!"
2,Another big disappointment,"Volume 1 of this series came out and did not live up to its promise. The shows are edited and the packaging is poor. No serious effort was made in the quality department. I kept Volume 1, hoping for a better result in the next release. Volume 2 arrived today and is as bad or worse than the first was -- I have decided to return it for refund. If this company can keep an audience long enough to release all 13 volumes, it will be a miracle to me. This item was another big disappointment."
5,A Couple of Terrific Shows,"I really bought this DVD as a present for my wife because Judy Garland sings ""A Cottage For Sale"", a song written by my wife's father. I had no idea how really great these shows were until we watched the DVD. They contained wonderful performances by not only Judy Garland, but by Lena Horne, Jerry Van Dyke, the very funny Terry Thomas and a VERY young looking Mel Torme'! I also want to comment on the outstanding quality of the picture and sound. Except for the fact that it was recorded in black and white, it looked like it could have been made yesterday instead of over 35 years ago!"
3,Eh...it's okay.,"As a homeschooling mama, I was looking for a fun, engaging way to teach my second grader to tell time. I popped in the video and my son kept saying, ""I don't understand what it's talking about."" I told him to be patient and keep watching...it wasn't getting any better. While watching it with him, I understood why it was so tricky. The whole video is done in this computer voice RAP...yes, rap. It's really distracting and hard to follow. I loved the animation and such, but wish there was just a normal voice explaining things, rather than rapping and rhyming. I turned it off, pulled out a clock chart that I bought from Lakeshore Learning Store, and within 15 minutes, he was telling time. I should have just done that in the first place. I also downloaded a ""time telling"" app on the iPad that he could play to reinforce what I taught him. You can read more about my homeschool favorites at my blog, ""Or so she says...""."
1,SuperYuppy,"I, too, in wanting my kid to excel, bought every educational DVD on the planet (all the Baby Einstein, Little Einstein, Sesame Street, Leap Frog, Electric Company, and many more)and found this one to be the most repulsive. The music is really loud and mundane, the narrating voice is monotone, and the graphics are simple. My son, who is in kindergarten, prefers to look at a clock to learn to tell time. I prefer it, too. Waste of time and money."
4,Telling time,My kids love this video. I bought it for my [...] to reinforce telling time she was learning in school. My 3 year loved the video and begs to watch it. He actually learned how to tell time by watching this video. Even my one year old loved it!
2,WTF. Digital version problem,I just bought this book and I have a problem already. The beauty of a kindle is that you can tap on a word and get a definition. Why doesn't that work with this book? The formatting of the digital version doesn't work this way. What a real shortcoming. This would be a major asset when using this book.
3,No pronounciations,The book gives you new words with no pronounciation. There is a breif chapter in the begining of the book that give a general guide but nothing with each word. So you have to kind of figure it out. I am not happy with this book and feel it is a waste of time and money :(
3,OK book. Better than some.,"We are using this book in a conversation class. It is good for organizing exercises, and it contains very few errors compared to other sources I have used. Keep in mind that no book is going to teach you Spanish; you have to use it in conjunction with audio and/or personal contact with native speakers, reading newspapers or other such material, etc. If you don't already have a step-by-step book, this might be a good one to start with."
5,Very good book for beginners,Very good book for beginners. Has given step by step and systematic approach to learn spanish. The exercises at the end of each chapter makes us learn even more
4,"How do you define ""easy?""","Easy Spanish Step-By-StepMy wife is a native Spanish speaker who teaches Spanish lessons. She finds this book extremely helpful for the way Spanish students learn. If you are looking for a helpful, intuitive, workable text for either a classroom or individual learning this is a very good one. However, please do not take the title too seriously. If you are going to complete 1 lesson in one week you are going to work very hard at it. The student would do well to remember that ""if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is."" Learning Spanish (like learning any other language) takes hard work and it will not happen overnight--even with ""15 quick and easy steps."""
4,Worth a look - worked for me,"I am not experienced with other books like this but I have spent about 12 weeks and am about 80% through (including actually doing all the exercises). Time well spent, I think. The reviewer who said this is the ""worst"" has nothing good to say about any book - check him out. And comment about needing tutor is not how I feel. You cannot discount the benefit of use of some companion audio material (Pimsleur for me)."
5,Very Good,I agree with the other 5 star ratings. This is a very good and logically structured approach to learning Spanish through grammar. You really retain a lot of Spanish this way. I also seem to remember the rules of construction better without really thinking about them. That's great in and of itself!
5,Easy to Understand,"I took a six week Speed Spanish course, and then wanted to work at it on my own, as it was hard for me to go as fast as the class went. This book is not only easy to understand, it has helped me understand things better that were in my original course work. It also has challenging quizes that help you learn as well."
3,Easy Spanish Step-By-Step [Kindle Edition],"Nice book, but I gave it a three stars rating because it has no page numbers; and for this sort of book, page numbers, would make it more convenient for my use."
2,A little dissapointment,I have a hard time learning Spanish using this book. I was expecting a step-by-step process but it seems to jump around too much.
4,Clear and concise textbook,"I began teaching a community enrichment class in Spanish and was looking for something less cumbersome in a textbook. After considering many different texts I chose Easy Spanish. This book is not overwhelming for most people having their first experience with Spanish and is very inexpensive. It lacks graphics which may account for the reasonable price but I was able to make up for that with handouts in class. Most people were interested in travel and this book is small enough to take along allowing for continued study; right when its needed most. I also like the organization, although its a little fast as regards grammer, it does allow people to develop some basic conversational skills quickly. All of the grammatical concepts and vocabulary are reintroduced in readings in the following chapters which provides great reinforcement and a sense of achievement."
4,Beginners in Spanish getting their feet wet,"We use this book as a beginner's text in a class for senior citizens in a snowbirds' mobile home park in Texas. The price is right. We old folks could use a bit larger print sizes but most of us find the book easy to use & helpful.One thing I like about it is that Bregstein gives clear and unambiguous rules-of-thumb when that is what is called for. A good thing for beginners, IMHO. Best suited for informal classes or adult individual learners, a bit simple for more ""academic"" purposes."
2,Not easy and not fast,"The book advertises that you can learn Spanish in 15 easy lessons. For one thing, the lessons are quite long and dense, containing a lot of information to learn in just one lesson. Why not break up the information into shorter lessons that would be easier to digest?Another frustrating thing about using this text is that it won't help you to speak in anytime soon. Isn't part of the fun and impetus in learning a foreign language conversing with others? You don't even get to the past tense until 200 pages into the book. Try conversing with someone and not using the past tense...it's frustrating and just doesn't work.Also, my native-speaking tutor is constantly pointing out inaccuracies and unnatural language usage.I've discovered the Madrigal book, and this has made learning fun and easy!"
1,Cannibalized textbook,"At first glance, this looks like a solid tool for teaching oneself Spanish or teaching others. On closer examination, one realizes that it is a cannibalization of what must have been a more comprehensive textbook. The cannibalization was done in a haphazard way that left out things that are essential and included things that are less essential, at least for a basic knowledge of the language. For example, there is a detailed chapter on the subjunctive mood, but completely absent is the imperative. This would be like learning English in such a way as to allow you to say, ""It is necessary that he be there,"" but to leave you clueless as to how to say ""Come here."" Also absent are the present perfect and past perfect tenses, as well as the future and the conditional. Surely, one should learn how to say, ""I have eaten"" or ""I would do it if..."" before one learns the subjunctive. I bought this book with the intention of using it to teach Spanish to my son. I returned it the next day."
3,"A good start, but there are much better ""complete"" sets out there....","Just for the sake of completeness, you may want to try the full set of recorded Rachmaninoff preludes by Alexander Budyonny, a Russian pianist with the right ""feel"" and absolutely superb technique. I agree with the previous reviewer that no one can compare to Sviatoslav Richter in this category, but the reviewer seems to overlook (other than Shelley, Weissenberg, etc.) other important artists who have contributed to this important ouevre by Rachmaninoff."
2,Not so good,"This review book was not so helpful. The study guides were helpful but the samples and problems in the book were not the same as the test. This guide made me stress more than I needed to. Also, some of the information in the book was wrong! It made me doubt myself more than it helped. There were plenty of practice questions though!"
1,"Mistakes, difficult to understand","Like other reviews have already said, don't waste your time. I was questioning myself until I read the reviews on here. Luckily I only checked this out at the library, so I only wasted time. Still, being frustrated was not worth it."
4,In very good condition,The book is in great condition. Thank you very much for the book; it will help as my daughter prepares for the PPST.
1,Do NOT buy this book.,"I purchased this book based on the fact that it was the most recently published volume on the shelf. After working through some of the practice test material I found a slew of typos and errors that just ended with me frustrated. Honestly, I can understand a typo, but not in an exam prep book... for future educators!!Do NOT buy this book."
1,Flawed questions,"As I worked my way through the diagnostic test at the beginning of the book, I often found that the answer choices given were incorrect in the math section. I questioned the accuracy of the answers in the reading section as well, but since the reading questions are somewhat subjective, it's hard to be sure if they're wrong.Like the above reviewer, this book has made me question myself more than it has helped me prepare for the Praxis I. Also, I question how adequately it actually prepared me for the exam. If there were that many errors, how do I know that the writers actually took the time to make a solid prep book that mirrors the Praxis I test as closely as possible?Overall, it seems a hastily put together book that will harm rather than help your test preparation."
3,Some issues,"Two problems:1. Occasionally, after resetting the counter, the internal gears don't mesh correctly and the counter won't turn. This is especially aggravating in my business of measuring crash scenes, where I'm dodging traffic and only have a moment to get a measurement.2. The folding stand broke off in the first week."
1,Simply horrible,"The music is simply awful. I enjoyed the CD from the first season (as well as the opening digital theme) and am still reeling from the granola chomping, politically correct, old fashioned and weird theme song from Season 2. NOT hot, NOT cool, NOT fun to listen to. Elizabeth Ziff's negative influence has really hung a job on the musical score- I am left pondering WHY Showtime and Ilene Chaiken have let her run wild with this glob of amateurish and self indulgent effort."
1,"Big fan of the show, this ""music"" ruins it","This is an excellent TV show that was hijacked this season by ezgirl (a.k.a. one of the hairy members of BETTY). This cd is her attempt to make creative background music, but really it is just endless ridiculous versions of the awful new theme song of the show. The theme song is incredibly cheesy, and so are the subsequent versions of it. The five star reviews here are probably left by ezgirl, since she is so proud of herself."
4,Music form the L Word TV Series,Good listening from varied Artists. New artists. It's not lesbian music. You won't become a lesbian listening to it. Used on the TV Series The L Word.
5,"Simple, well-designed alarm clock.","Just a good, simple alarm clock. It's nothing fancy, but it's attractive, straight forward, and dependable. Mine just started losing time, but it worked perfectly for the past seven years. After looking around for a replacement, I think I'll end up just buying another one of these. It's surprisingly hard to find a clock these days that's not loaded down with unnecessary features, cheap, but still well-made."
3,BRIGHT,"Way too bright for the bedroom, which is what I got it for. A very nice looking, compact unit though."
5,Great clock for less price,This is awesome clock that is ideal for dark environments and also does a cool job of a annoying alarm if you know what I mean...remember those hangover days when you have to get up no matter what? well this clock will make sure you are out of your bed in 30 seconds!!
3,Too bright,"The clock works great, but it lights up the room. I have to put something in front of it and block the view."
1,Really Bad Clock,"It is very difficult to read the time - all the bars that create the numbers light up at the same time - some are dim, some are bright, so you can guess at the time! I am returning this item to Amazon."
5,I want to go to Norway!!,"I saw some of the episodes when they were originally aired. What a great series. If you enjoy Scandanavia at all, these episodes will do if for you, the scenery and history are spectacular. There is a wide variety of foods explored, that's what makes it appealing. Lots of sea food, potatoes, and aquavit! From doing some fish in a fisherman's shack in sub zero temeratures, to going back to Andreas's families summer retreat out in the country. Lots of interesting foods and places. I agonized about buying the DVDs for weeks, very glad that I did. I love Emeril and Mario B, this is way different!"
4,"Living With the Blues, my review from Barcelona","This is a very good record by one of the current best guitar players and blues musicians. Here Duke devotes most of his time to received repertoire, offering as always first-class playing. He covers magnificently songs from B. B. King, Guitar Slim, Freddie King and also an unplugged version of a slide guitar master Tampa Red's ""Hard Road"". The record also contains a very attractive cover of Willie Dixon's ""I live the life I love"", first recorded by Muddy Waters, who made it one of this classic tunes. The title record song ""Living with the Blues"", besides being a great tune by Brownie McGhee, is an appropriate title for this album. It is of course very hard to say who my favourite guitarist is, because there are several players who can qualify depending of the moment, but I'm sure DUKE ROBILLARD is one of them."
2,Blech,"Terrible teribble book. It was dull, simple, confusing. Alice had the worst motives eather. ""Only bad boys give you herpeis"". Come on that is lame. Never read this book. It is that terrible. Never read it."
4,Disappointed,"I love all of Christopher Pike's books, including this one. What disappointed me is...there is no ending to the copy I got!!!! They left out six pages and it's driving me crazy 'cause I don't know how it ends. Nobody should be subjected to this type of cruelty."
4,"Good All Round ""Spotters Guide"" to VW Beach Buggies",A good all round 'spotters guide'. Good to see a UK influence. Nice little historical/ film reference touches. A must for the Buggista.
4,Smooth and Sweet Sound,"While searching for guitar and solo guitar music, I bought this CD based on the reviews - What a terrific find! This CD rocks!"
5,Works great,"Recovery is great, gains are great, lifts definetly went up. No complaints here, dirt cheap compared to gnc and the vitamin shoppe."
3,Worst tasting thing Ive ever had!,I need the amino acids... Point blank. When I work out I work so hard my sweat smells like ammonia. Which is basically my body breaking down amino acids. Also Im doing the xtreme fat loss diet where you over eat one day and fast the next. On the fast day you are suppose to do nothing but drink water and supplement with bcaa. Well I figured unflavored ON BCAA should be fine in some water being as the ON unflavored Creatine is fine.... WRONG! I gag when I take this supplement. Now adding it to my post workout recovery shakes is fine. Drinking this stuff straight up in water is almost impossible.
5,A must have,BCAA's are a key part of recovery and this product is fairly priced. Highly recommended!
2,Not good enough,"If you were thumbing through the American English section of your bookstore, this would not be the book you would take home. Research is what distinguishes the books in this category, and this one has only shallow, and sometimes incorrect, insights to offer. A much better book on the same topic is ""How To Talk American"" by Jim Crotty. Example: there are 15 pages on New York City vocabulary and pronunciation in ""How To Talk AMerican"", only 3 in this book. ""How To Talk"" is more articulate, and serves up such accurate items as Losaida and DUMBO and NoLIta that is lacking in ""How We Talk"". There are inaccuracies in How We Talk that I found distracting, and the contrast in value between the books is instructive. If you are interested in this topic, ""How To Talk American"" is accurate, well-researched and well-articulated, and ""How We Talk"" will let you down. Also, Bill Bryson has written a couple of books on this general topic, and they are all good reads."
4,The Roman Imperial Army,"Webster's book is considered a leading source on the topic, and it should be noted that it is not for beginners. That said, it ought also be noted that it is not for the advanced student, either: those of us who have studied the Roman army in some detail will not find many new takes on the sources we have, except for a very interesting discussion of the Etruscan influence on Roman warfare, which I personally enjoyed a lot. As it stands, this book is a definite middle ground: excellent in its own right, but not adequately targeted to either audience. For a student of the Classics who has some background with Roman history this book will indeed be invaluable, but for graduate students and professionals it does not contribute anything radically new, no matter how elegant and stimulating as Webster's treatment may be."
4,"Detailed, easy to read",This book is good reading for someone trying to learn about Roman legions without getting swamped. It's detailed enough but not to much to overwhelm and there is a Latin glossary in the back.
3,This work is short on connections!,"I bought this book and was VERY disappointed with it. You build a scenario for Christ's life before, during and after his crucifixion upon these ancient sources. I found your work to be conjecture, at best, and very lacking in references to ANY ancient script!You have a very lengthy bibliography that shows you have read a lot of others work but you make no connection to the work of others or to these ancient manuscripts to your theory. I am willing to grant you that your theory may be correct but it does not stand the test of being built on any foundation at all!"
1,Dubious,"This book relies on the credibility of varoious aporyphal sources. The author exhibits knowledge of current scholarship in his treatment of the synoptic gospels, but does not apply the same standard to the Gospel of John, which he treats as authentic, or at least the most authentic of the four gospels. The same is true in his treatment of apocryphal literature, which were written later than the gospels. His preference for these writings over the synoptic gospels is unclear.The author's lack of source notes is irritating, especially considering the content of the book, which leads one to want to know more about the subject and the sources. Instead, he gives a list of source material at the end of the book.For a more scholarly analysis, I recommend Raymond E. Brown's ""Death of the Messiah."" Or ""Introduction to the New Testamont"" by the same author."
1,Paganism forgerys uncovered by one without scholarship.,"Pagans once wrote forgerys to confuse christians about Jesus Christ to prevent conversion. The author never mentions these events in his book and we must question his scholarship to say the least. If he wants fame anyone can copy forgerys and claim they are real, but if he truly wants understanding for all people, then he must abandon such trivia and drivel as he quotes and writes. Saint Charbal onec said, ""The Living Are Dead And The Dead Are Living."" Well, question the source and sources and you will find the truth, but no here dear, is that clear dear!"
3,An American Hero,"This is a fascinating and interesting book, full of hiddenfacts that force the reader to become involved in the book. Togetherwe share his triumphs and tragedies: we are with him when he flies theAtlantic, we are there when he loses his son. A must read for all those who have fantasised of being a hero."
4,What is the Sound of One Cat Lady Giggling,"If you love cats you'll love this. I've added 2 of the catkus to my signature in my e-mails:Kittens, butterflies,And sunsets need no reasons.Add sardines to that.You seek fulfillmentThrough love, wealth, travel, career.Have you tried kittens?I actually read this book several times while waiting for doctor's appointments. Usually a light book like this would not interest me enough to distract me from my nervousness before an appointment. But this one had me giggling. The illustrations are lovely. This one's essential for cat lovers."
5,Electric love,"When Dotty falls from a ladder, she is brought into the hospital where Macy works. Macy lives at the house Dotty was painting. Macy becomes Dotty's nurse after she leaves the hospital, and the two embark on a love affair. The past histories of both women creep back into their lives and threaten to destroy what's being born. Schutzer's circular and nonlinear story is full of potent writing and moving descriptions of the past pain and vivid silences both women have endured. And the surprise connection between Dotty and Macy is beautifully crafted. Schutzer's style reminded me a bit of Scott Heim, but not as dark. Any reader who's a fan of such emotionally charged works as Emma Donoghue's ""Hood"" and Alison Green's ""Half-moon Scar"" will adore this novel. This is one of my favorite novels of 2000!"
2,too boring and technical.,"This book might be enjoyable for those who love technicaldetails, math, formulas, theories of contact with aliens, etc.The author does _not_ write about what actually did happen...his ideas were not utilized in sending signals or establishing contact with aliens.He writes what he hopes or advises SETI and others to use in creatinga message for ET.I feel like I've read dozens of books on this topic, and do not need someone'sopinions who was not directly involved in creating messages for aliens.Had Mr.McConnell worked alongside Carl Sagan and others in creating a message for aliens, and had in fact that message(s) been sent out to the stars, then we could've had a whole different ball game."
3,Interesting info about SETI but too boring part 3,Good introduction to SETI and the description about the mechanisms used is very good.The third part of the book is much too boring.(You should be able to look at the table-of-contents to see what's in there)Besides that I was very surpirsed (negative) that this is an O'Reilly book with a hard-cover and wihout O'Reilly-like layout and useability. - This is no real O'Reilly book.
3,Be careful...,I purchased these based on positive reviews and price point. I use the skillets almost every morning and always hand wash. They've proven durable over several months and they cleanup easily. That said I noticed the 3 quart pan has many deep scratches in the coating requiring replacement. I admit to the occasional use of a pair of metal tongs to pick up pasta but find the surface coating unusually soft.I'll replace metal with plastic or coated utensils but still disappointed in the durability of the coating as compared to earlier reviews. If I had been using knives or aggressively scraping or pounding on the surface I would not have any concerns recommending this product. As is I can only give an average rating compared to other non-stick cookware used previously.
5,Great Value!,"I love these pans. As a mother of four who cooks daily, I was so thrilled to find this great quality for the price. I have compared these to a friend's Calphalon set, and I must say that I think these are much better!"
4,Good quality at a great price,"We've been using this set for about a month and are enjoying it quite a bit so far. The non-stick surfaces are excellent and very easy to clean. The weight of the pots and pans is good, solid but not too heavy. They heat up quickly and cook evenly. The picture shows that the saute pan has a handle but the one we received didn't. That's the only complaint we have."
4,Analon 10 pce cookware,"The pots seem to be great.The open fry pans are too small for the taper of the sides. They have a very small cooking surface unless you cook on the sides of your pans.The lids have no venting which I have on a much less expensive set.I have added larger pans to the 10 piece set that I bought in order to get a better selection of pans to feed more than 4 people. I think they would be fine for a small family or someone who simply heats things up.I've only had them a couple weeks but the quality seems very good, the casting is heavier than last year and the teflon coating appears to be well done. Time will tell on teflon coating. The handles appear well attached and they are supposed to withstand up to 400 degrees which means, in my oven (which is brand new) you would have to set the heat at 350 or below.At this point, I feel pretty good about the buy."
4,Just a little bit more needed,"I purchased these pots and pans because they are absolutely gorgeous looking. I like the design and how it goes in the kitchen with the color. Cooking on them is awesome, I'm no gourmet chef but the non-stick truly works and it takes very little heat to cook the food evenly.The only snafu is that as a 10 piece set it was about 3 dollars cheaper than anywhere else but the ""anywhere else"" came with 2 bonus pots for about 99.00 more but that wasn't an option with this set and to buy the 2 items in addition to this set it was about 60.00 more expensive."
4,Anodized aluminum IS NOT Teflon....Do better research,This is great cookware.I've owned it for quite a while. Cleans beautifully and cooks evenly. People have jumped to the erroneous conclusion that anodized aluminum and Teflon are the same thing because they have a similar color. This is not the case.

3,"Slow to heat up, limitation on the type of cooking oil","I only bought the 12"" pan at Bed Bath & Beyond. Since, I could only use low to medium heat on a gas grill (as directed on the instruction), the pan takes a long time to heat up. Also, it is recommended to use Olive oil and peanut oil for favor only. Does anyone use the Canola Oil? I've send this question to the Customer service, and never get a response back."
3,DOOLITTLE RAID REDUX,"This is okay story, some of the background on characters tend to slow down the story. The paranormal elements seem out of place. The action tends to make up for the rest."
3,Hard To Follow,"I was beginning to think this was a history lesson for the beginning days of modern Israel, with a little story thrown in. Throughout the entire book, most of the background was on the Mossad agents which were one of the groups of bad guys, while he spent almost no time explaining the French bad guys, and not much on the protagonists. There were times I even forgot who the protagonists were. Yet, the book finally came around a bit at the end, though there was plenty of techno-mystic-ghost babble thrown in to lose me more often than not.The most redeeming thing about this story was the ending, but I don't think I've had a harder time reading a book in years. This author obviously has talent and quite a history of good works, so I won't judge him just on this story. Maybe I'll try one of his other works to see if he just had a bad day."
2,Disappointed in this one.,"This was only my second Tim Powers story.The first was The Anubis Gates. I loved the intrigue, characters, time travel and the great ending.This story was just plain odd. The whole Einstein connection was almost laughable. The characters never grabbed me at all. Presently I'm giving another Tim Powers story a chance. Maybe I'm just not the audience for most of his stories."
4,"Fascinating, exciting, and fun.","This book is a solid entry in the espionage science fiction supernatural mystery thriller category. I don't know if there are any other books in that genre, so I'm going to say that this is actually the best one out there. And if it's not, I'd like to read the one that is.Since it's a book by Tim Powers, there are some really fascinating historical tidbits and other trivia as well as some intriguing ideas and theories, plus a story that twists off in surprising directions and is populated by interesting characters, some of whom were real (and really interesting) people."
3,"Not his best, but a must for Powers fans","Let me preface this review by saying that Tim Powers could copy 500 pages out of the Budapest telephone book, give it a catchy title, and I'd buy it just in case it was a work of genius; this is Tim Powers we're talking about! Sadly, ""Three Days to Never"" falls short of the mark. It really has the feel of a short story that's been expanded into a novella, and then expanded further into a novel. In short, the characters fail to catch our sympathy, the historical references are just barely there, and the bad guys (take your pick) seem to be pasted in from a different story.If you're a Tim Powers fan buy this book. You have to. It's TIM POWERS! If you're new to the convoluted genius of Mr. Powers I respectfully suggest that you start with one of his earlier works. ""Declare"" remains at the top of my short list of the greatest books ever written. Thank you, this has been my first review."
3,Not his best....,"There are just so many Tim Powers books that will blow your mind, and sadly this is not one of them. It is consistent with his genius, and is a very readable and enjoyable book. But compared with THE STRESS OF HER REGARD, ON STRANGER TIDES, DECLARE, and of course THE ANUBIS GATES, this is only so-so.Having said that, I would still rather read a Powers book for the second time than read anything else for the first."
2,Didn't like it.,"That's it! I just didn't like it. I will give it 2 stars because of the originality in the contents and the characters; but at the same time this is what I also didn't like. I couldn't possibly imagine Einstein and Charlie Chaplin playing with the occult, the ghosts and the spirits. Why Grammar didn't destroy the machine years ago only to wait until now? And what of Lepidot and his premonitions? It seems to me that the author took a lot of time writing and narrating the first part of the book, only to wrap up the ending and make it a little confusing. I bought the book based on the title and the little summary on the back of the cover... and it was totally misleading! I was expecting something alse!I will definitely try another one of Tim Powers' books, and hope for better outcomes!"
2,Dis-Jointed,"Really hard to read; not a bad science fiction premise, but unable to get it out of second gear. Just painful. I just finished this book and I felt like it was like taking bad medicine."
1,Bad,This book seemed to have a lot of promise in the story but just never really got going. I kind of had to make up stuff for myself because I think a lot was left out in some descriptions and way too much in others. Takes about 200 pages for things to actually start happening and the only reason I finished is becasue I payed the hardcover price for it. Most of the characters or not develpoed well enough at all. Just not put together nicely.
2,Time travel is enough. leave out the ghosts and stuff,"What I thought would be an interesting trip through time and the consequences of time travel, was all jumbled up with ghosts, astrial traveling and disappearing infant clones. Sorry, but it was all alittle too much for me.The father / daughter relationship was interesting and the only thing worthwhile in this story."
1,Lewis Misses the Target,"Martin W. Lewis sets out in his book ""Green Delusions"" to give an overall critique to the radical environmental movement, but his critique totally misses the target. The book was published in 1992 and feels out dated and irrelevant. So much have changed in the world and so has the environmental movement. ""Green Delusions"" seems far left behind in its arguements and view upon the world. Critique is always necessary when dealing with any question, especially environmental issues, but ""Green Delusions"" is with no doubt NOT the book to buy, if you're looking for good critique."
2,2 faulty units,"I have always been a satisfied customer for Netgear products so I proceeded to order these switches when I needed POE for a VOIP upgrade we were doing in our network. Unfortunately, we appear to have received 2 faulty units. First unit had ports 1-12 die within 24 hours. They worked at first. We subsequently had a few other ports go inoperative over the next few days in the 13-17 range. Not sure what was going on.We then installed Switch #2 to replace it. It ran for a weekend and then found that some ports would not allow a booted PC to acquire an IP address with DHCP. We power cycled the switch and it NEVER rebooted properly. The power LED was on but no other indicators of proper activity.We have tried other power sources (we were in a UPS) but the switches still do not function.It's worth noting at this point that a replacement 48 port switch and two additional 24 port switches are functioning as expected in the same environment so that still seems to point to defective switches.DL"
2,Jack is a Dull Boy,"This film had a lot of great elements (supporting actors, music, strong directing), but it's weakest element is ironically the film's title character, Jack Brooks.Neither convincing nor interesting, Jack comes off as a [...], his rage issues seeming to come from a different film (or script draft) altogether - that play no part in his defeating the 'Monster'.Or maybe I just think the actor playing Jack did a lousy job selling that arc.Yeah, THAT."
1,Prety Bad,"This movie is a waste of your time. I hope that some of the actors in this movie get a start in movie making from this movie, but that is about it. The story line is terrible, it's a jumbled mess."
3,Points for trying,"In this movie, a charming Canadian bad boy plumber must defeat Robert Englund, who has been possessed by an evil spirit. Though the movie's heart is in the right place with light humor amidst scary elements, I thought the gross-out aspect (vomiting, drooling into your own eye, coating any surface with green ichor) was an unwelcome distraction. Still, I want to applaud this movie for using mostly (probably entirely) physical effects instead of pulling in CGI.I hate to say it, but the main reason I impulse-bought this movie was because of the abs on the cover, and the lead never ended up taking his shirt off! Petty, I know, but if you are getting this for the same reasons I did, you would be better off renting Amityville Horror again...."
4,good dvd,came in origional packaging with walmart sticker and everything lol it took longer than usual which was wierd sense it came from cali and i got something from michigan i ordered on the same day about a week earlier...but other than the wait it was awesome!!!
4,A Fun Time,"This is a very well made horror film. The main character Jack Brooks is a messed up teen that watched his family being slaughtered on a camping trip years before and because of the guilt he feels for running away to save himself from the monsters in the woods,he is a total jerk to everyone that has to deal with him.There are some funny scenes involving the shrink that he goes to for venting about his miserable life. All of the supporting cast is topnotch and quite amusing. Robert Englund is very good in this.Overall I had a good time and there are a lot of usual extras on the disc, commentary and deleted scenes & more. I will never again hear Bobby Darin's Beyond The Sea without thinking about this movie."
1,"This is not a horror movie, it is horrible (as in ghastly) movie","If you are into juvenile horror movies - this one is for you. I wanted to see it for Halloween season and I did and now I cannot wait to get rid of it. Premise of the movie is that our main character Jack Brooks is an orphan whose sister and parents were killed by a monster when he was a kid. Jack has unresolved anger issues and his counceling sessions are not helping him control his temper. When his accidental plumbing job awakens monsters from their long sleep and they start attacking his night school college student buddies, Jack finds it in himself to figh off the monsters as a way of conquering his own personal demons. This is a cross of gross (throw up) scenes, imitations of rubber made monsters you may have seen in movies made 20 years ago and blood hungry zombies running around in their feeding frenzy."
1,Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer,"I bought this movie because it sounded like a good movie to enjoy and because I had been reading that several people had likened it to the ""Evil Dead"" set of movies. First, this movie was BAD and mean BAD in the terrible way. I guess my take on the ""Evil Dead"" series was a little different than the comments that I read. The amount of foul language in the movie was astonishing. The f%@k word was used in almost every sentence. I know, or better yet, believe, that a good monster movie can be made with out all the trashy language. A few well chosen sentence enhancers is very appropriate, but this was just plain awful. I bought the movie so now I have to live with it, but I doubt that I watch it again until I have forgotten how bad it is. I can not recommend this movie for any one. Thanks."
1,One of the worst movies ive ever seen.,"I thought the movie looked and sounded cool by the dvd case. But the acual movie sucked. Plot was horrible, the action was horrible, hardly any action...Bad acting. Movie straight up sucked. Dont wast your money or your time. Its long too, or at least it seemed long...really really bad movie."
3,An Enjoyable B-Movie,"This movie sort of reminds me ofSlither, which I thought was much better than this one. Having said that, I still enjoyed this movie. It's a decent low budget B-Movie that stars one of my favorite horror actors.Yes, I'm talking about the one and only Robert Englund. This has got to be one of his best performances ever. Just watching him transform from a nerdy, mild mannered night school science teacher into a black hearted monster was great. I like that he doesn't start off as the killer/monster.Of course the story isn't about Robert Englund's character. It's about the title character, Jack Brook.Jack happens to have some anger issues, that are rooted in seeing his family killed by a monster. That of course is what helps lead him onto the path of a monster slayer.The movie itself is a bit cheesy and predictable, but I enjoyed it."
3,I Hope To See More Slaying In The Sequel,"Basically, Jack Brooks Monster Slayer is all set-up with only a pinch of execution. The film is only 85 minutes and most of that is spent with Jack (Trevor Matthews) in therapy, night school, or arguing with his girlfriend (Rachel Skarsten). I did enjoy Robert Englund as Professor Crowley. He plays the lonely old science teacher to perfection. I also got a kick out of the monster slaying once Jack found a way to manage his anger but it's over shortly after it begins. I guess we're locked in for the sequel now. With the backstory out of the way, we should see a lot more slaying. Jack might even become the next big thing in the horror genre."
5,Excellent,This is a great little booklet to read about emotional dependency. In our society we are fed lies about what love is and about what relationships should look and feel like. This booklet is jam packed with insights and truths about the way emotional dependency looks and feels. It's great for anyone who wants to understand relationship dynamics and to cultivate healthy relationships. It's especially good for counselors and counselees since emotional dependency is so common in the counselor/counselee relationship. One of the added bonuses about ordering this is that you get enough booklets to share with other people in need!
1,I am sorry but the CD is scratch,"El review lo voy a hacer en espanol porque me es mas facil. El CD esta rayado y todas las canciones se oyen a la mitad. Para ser un CD tan caro es un robo. Por favor diganme como devolverlo, porque no me interesa.Gracias, de todo lo que he comprado, primera vez que me sucede algo parecido"
4,Replacement for old hardware fit perfectly.,I had to replace the hardware currently on the sliding doors and this fit perfectly. Here are 5 more words.
3,"It has it's good points , some gaps too","Alex has returned to Earth through a wormhole, and thinks someone/something evil followed him. He looks a lot better, more confident than he used to (I don't think that is ever really explained). Michael meets a stranger outside the museum, it turns out to be his unknown brother who slipped through with Alex.Most of the book is spent with everyone trying to decide who should be trusted, mostly thinking that Trevor (Michael's brother)might be a danger. Alex thinks he might want the Stone that he used to get home, he does act like it. Kyle Valenti seems like a real villain at the last, nothing like the TV version was."
5,another alien in roswell: impossible,"but it is true. when a young man starts following michael around, he decides to get to the bottom of it. it turns out thathe is michael's long lost brother.(to go into how would take outa lot of the story line so i won't). isabel and max of course orvery suspicious and skeptical. is he wroking with their enemies?what reason do they have to trust him? why is he here in roswellafter so many years? for this and more read a very fascinatingstory. i thought it was great."
3,Rebel Review,"I'm a huge fan of The Roswell High series. Along with being a big fan of the Michael and Maria relationship. I was excited about this book since on the back cover it talked about Michael and Maria, so I figured there might be some angst in this story. I was pretty wrong. The hole Kevin kidnapping thing didn't even happen until the last 20 pages of the book, and it was resolved really quickly. I was pretty disappointed... Although the fact that I'm such a huge fan of the book series, and my expectations were pretty high. Although I'm now saying that you shouldn't read it if you aren't interested. It was a good story I was just expecting more from it. Like the fact that Alex's return was barely a big deal at all. Well, overall it was a mediocre book."
5,zuva world traveler,"Well done louis mhlanga, this was well writen and in true Jazz form. We need more music jazzy like this. I know you can deliver. Everyone I have shared this cd with likes it the very first time they hear it. Well done my friend."
1,disappointing,"I enjoy good photography, dogs and Greece has got to be one of the most photogenic places on earth. This book promised to be a great one but I found that ultimately I was disappointed. Although some of the pictures of the dogs were likeable, this book didn't really seem to bring out the beauty of the Greek Islands.Furthermore I found the author's attitude that somehow being a stray dog on a Greek Island is an easy and desirable existence to be naive and silly at best. Greece has a pretty bad record on animal welfare and I shudder to think how the dogs are really treated when not being photographed. Being homeless, hungry and subject to human abuse all the time is not a desirable situation for any animal, even on a fantastic Greek Island."
3,Almost good,"The belt seems to be ruggedly made, and will probably hold up well. If I can actually wear it. The sizing said that the XL size would fit 46 and up. I normally wear a 44 waist, so I figured the XL would be good to go over my pants and shirt to carry my holster and ammo pouch. With nothing on it and just going over my shirt, I can just get it buckled when fully extended, but it's tight! Might have to give it to my wife and try something else for my needs. If you are a 40 waist or under, it should be fine, but if over that I suggest you try something else."
4,As Advertised,My old belt has metal buckles and these are plastic. If that's what you want then these are built well and work fine.
3,Too Wide,Caution: This belt may be too wide for your belt loops. Another review says it is 2.25 inches wide. I ordered this item and it would not fit my belt loops. Be sure of what you want before ordering this 2.25 inch wide belt.
3,garrison belt,Just OK. A little flimsy and keepers are not the greatest. Will do in a emergency situation
5,Sturdy quality and great value,"I have to be honest I first got this delivered to me and I was a little regretful because i thought ""how am I going to use this big thing?"" After a few days i got tired of trying to take my paddle holster (that holds my Barretta M9A1) off of my pants while wearing a regular belt, after my chonies almost came off with it I decided to give this ""big ol belt"" a try. I put this on over my pants regular belt and belt buckle adjusted (a lil looser) it and it was surprisingly comfortable I attached my paddle style holster to it and it felt like it wasn't even there! There was no dragging on my pants anymore, I no longer have to pull up my pants every 15 min and it detaches without almost ripping my undies off! Overall great buy solved all my hip concealment issues for one very fare price. I would buy it again and would recommend it to anyone with the same issues or looking for a impressive amount of bang for there buck"
5,I love it,Again it is exactly what it says it is.2 and a half inches wide.Metal accessories.Rugged plastic buckle.Perfect sizing. And is sizable.Very good product.
2,it looks cool.,"Ithought this was a regular belt and its super wide. WAY too wide to fit in my belt loops. other than that it seemed well made. IDK really, i only kept it for a day before sending it back."
4,Nice belt for women too,"I got this for a costume to use with a utility pouch. I'm a female, waist size ~27 and this belt was adjusted to fit perfectly.It was sturdy and had a good buckle. I can definitely use this belt in the future with the pouch for emergency response drills/simulations. Overall, I'm very glad I bought this product!"
5,Nice belt.,"This is a nice belt that didn't cost me an arm and a leg. I have a 44 inch waist and had to adjust it almost all the way out so if you are any larger than that I would find a different one. That was wearing it over blue jeans and a tucked in shirt. Very sturdy, belt and hardware. The color is also nice and solid."
5,Greatest holiday video since the Grinch,"It has been a tradition for the past couple of years to have all the neighborhood kids over to watch this HILARIOUS video. Grown-ups *love* it, too! The Hanukkah song in it is great as well. Mr. Bumpy is some of the most imaginative children's entertainment produced!"
3,Bumpy finds a moral,"this movie is a good one to teach kids all about giving and greed. it shows pieces of two holidays too, that makes it a good learning video. the fact that it is about disgusting creatures from the closet and under the bed makes it fun for kids."
5,Love It!,"The toaster somehow toasts the bread the perfect amount without overcooking and keeps it warm until pulling it out. Looks great, cool on outside; is really awesome."
1,Returning -- arrived damaged -- no replacement,"Opened the package--which seemed sufficient--interior box in good shape--but the top of the toaster was dented. And Stainless Steel has brown spots on it. Appears that we got someone else's return. Amazon site would not allow us to order a replacement--return only. So, we will go to another retailer. From a distance the toaster looks great on the counter w/ our matching mixer!"
3,A good movie for thinkers.,"I have viewed all three of the Lain videos. I had to watch them several times to gain the slightest bit of understanding. If you are a Matrix fan, I think you will love this movie."
5,"HELP ME, I HAVENT SEEN THIS MOVIE YET!","To tell you the truth, I haven't sen this movie yet. But I have heard great things. So if anyone wants to pitch a detailed review at me, then feel free. Because chances are, I probably won't get to see any of the Lains."
2,"Ponderous, limited, and confusing anime ...","This series, about a girl on the 'wired' (internet of sorts) finding intrigue and danger, is far from intriguing or dangerous. The animation is minimal and choice of shots inadequate to maximize storytelling without animation. Perhaps one of the greatest problems is the limited story carries on for far too many episodes. The coloring is too bright too often which makes the different animation levels pop out against each other in an awkward way. All the drawings are crisp and well constructed, and the designs are decently pleasing. For this price, I wouldn't recommend 'Lain'...perhaps if twice as many episodes were per DVD it would be a favorable purchase."
3,Vanilla,"This is the edition I grew up with, and there's nothing actually wrong with it. But the Coopersmith and the Watkins Shaw editions are better in that they include some of the other versions of some sections that Handel wrote. They give you more choice and flexibility in deciding how you want to perform it. And yes, all are equally authentic."
5,Messiah vocal score,This was exactly what I needed to participate in my community choirperformance of the Messiah.
5,Handel's Messiah,My copy of Handel's Messiah arrived when stated and in in perfect condition. Thank you
2,Not Quite,"Love the size, like an old clam shell phone, but very hard to read the display in daylight or the weak backlight. I was disappointed."
1,Truly awful,I tried 2 of these and one was completely dead out of the box. The other one barely worked. The back light was terrible and made the display impossible to read.
1,Not worth the time.,"I bought one in the US and brought it back to my boat in Fiji. It lasted a couple of days and died. I replaced the battery and still the screen is blank. As I said, it's not worth the time to buy yhis model of clock."
1,Setting it up is horrible,"I would not recommend this to anyone. Trying to set the time, date and other features is very complicated. Don't ever lose the instructions because you will never figure out how to set it without them."
2,ALARM almost silent,"Purchased on April 28th, 2012. Clock is very nice looking and excellent size for traveling. Everything works well with the exception of the mostimportant part - The ALARM! It is so quiet you pretty much have to place it right next to your ear to hear it. I am returning it and willopt for another travel alarm."
1,3 C (Cheap Chinese Crap),"The metal case falls apart repeatedly. Even the slightest touch makes the back pop open. The battery is near impossible to finagle or wedge in its place. No LCD light comes on, despite the 'clock' advertised as the LCD. The only feature that actually works is the pipsqueak alarm.Save your money."
2,Get what you pay for,"I bought this clock at WalMart at the end of last year (2005). It was the cheapest travel clock with the features that I wanted. It has worked well as a daily alarm clock until about a month ago when the alarm stopped beeping. I have replaced the battery and the alarm still doesn't beep, but the display light flashes as normal. I got about 8 months out of this clock, so I guess that's not bad. But I wouldn't buy it again."
1,"Terrible, terrible product and evidently not made by ""Sharp""","I bought this travel alarm at Target. It was shoddy from the outset, but for $10 I managed to use it despite the dim display and tinny alarm for one trip. Then I realized the battery only lasts a few weeks. I would have spent more on batteries than the clock itself in the first year. It also began to literally pull apart at the seams. I mailed the clock to Sharp's corporate headquarters in NJ with my complaint and received a letter back saying it wasn't one of their products even though it clearly says ""Sharp"" right on the front. So either they are lying and producing terrible products or they are not protecting their trademark and allowing other companies to manufacture shoddy products and market them with the Sharp name. Either way I could never buy a product with the Sharp name on it again.... how could I ever be sure if it would be backed up by Sharp or not."
3,Really love this clock,"I bought this clock at Target and I really like it. I use it as my everyday alarm clock so it's gone through more use than a travel alarm would, although I travel with it as well. The clock looks nice, folds very compactly.Reading the other 2 bad reviews, I had to say how much I love this clock. I especially like the temperature feature. I've used this clock for months and the batteries are still going strong. I really appreciate the alarm time being displayed all the time. I don't have to wonder if I readjusted my wake up time for the next day as everyday I need to wake up at a different time.I gave this clock 3 stars because the back light blew out this week. I don't see a way to replace it. I've searched for small alarm clocks that I like and haven't found anything better. So I'm going to give this clock another try. The price is low enough to justify giving it another go."
2,Not a good wakeup clock,This clock is very small and good portability but it doesn't set very well because the buttons are too small for fingers and the ring is bearily audible and wouldn't wake one up very well. Not happy with it at all.
4,Decent,"I bought this product at Walmart. The outside scratches easily, but otherwise I haven't had any problems with the manufacturing or quality of the clock. I've only been using it for a few months, but it's been accurate and a good thing to have on camping trips because of the temperature reading on the screen."
1,No quality unreliable piece of junk,"I purchased this item for it's sleek portable design. Features looked great and display seemed easy to read. So I set the clock and the alarm on the first night. There is a large button in the center for Snooze and/or illumination. Every time you hit this button it clears the clock back to 12:00 and deletes any alarm settings. This happens every time. I managed to avoid touching the button for the next few days, but the clock still reset to 12:00 every time you turned off the alarm. By the end of the week, the battery door just kept falling off. Each time that happened, it became a bigger problem to keep the door secured. This product is just a piece of junk. Really, just junk."
1,Breaks in no time.,"It baffles me how one battery operated alarm clock can break and not another. This Sharp is adorable, but 2 have gone dead in under a year."
3,Indiglow light stops working,We've bought three of these now. Everything about them is great except that the indiglow light stops working after about a year. we tried putting in new batteries but it doesn't help so we buy a new one each time the indiglow light quits.
1,Dead Already!,I bought this for a present for myself and it died after 5 days usage! Now I have to spend shipping to send it back as well as pay them $6.00 to ship it back! Complete waste of money!
1,Arrived Broken... never worked.,Very disappointed. Mainly attracted by the simple design - but when it arrived it wouldn't even turn on. Would not recommend this product.
2,Hard to read display and loses time,"Other reviewers have mentioned that the display is impossible to read in the dark, as the light function is useless. In addition, this clock loses time (a few minutes a month) and started to malfunction after a year of light use."
2,Worked great for 14 months then...,"As other reviewers have reported, the alarm clock was very functional for a while and then the alarm quit working. We purchased this at Wal-Mart a while back. The temperature gauge was nice and it's difficult to beat the compact size. However, when we set the alarm now it doesn't beep anymore and the light just stays on during this period. We tried changing the battery but that doesn't help. I saw two other reviewers reported the same problem. FYI, the product is made in China. I'm kind of surprised that Sharp ties it's name to such a product. If you're looking for a short term solution for 6+ months then this will probably work fine but don't count on it as eventually it will probably stop working for you too. Just hope that the day it stops working is a non-important one for you!"
5,ergonomically well-designed,"This travel alarm clock is ergonomically well designed.I can't even list all the thoughtful features it has, because there are so many, but here are some: The display shows time, date, weekday, and alarm time simultaneously. The slide switch to change the alarm time is easily accessible, and with some familiarity you can change the alarm time in the dark. The clock has all the buttons you would want and they behave exactly as I intuitively expect them to; their size and locations are appropriately chosen. Some good thinking went into its design.This travel clock is ultra-thin and can only hold a thin battery. I have had it for a few months now and do not know yet how long the battery will last, but I wish there was a thicker version that can hold a longer-lasting battery."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought one of these a few years ago at Walmart and it lasted okay, and then died. So since I liked having the temp as well as the not-too-loud alarm, I ordered two more from here. I just threw the second one away yesterday, and the first one about a week before that. Something is wrong with the battery connections so the battery doesn't always connect, and the clock resets itself to 12:00, if it comes back on at all. I fooled around adjusting the connection points, and finally threw it away.Don't waste your money."
1,A new low in re-release sound quality,"CDs on this label are frequently just rehashes of much older material. The various tracks here date from the early 50's to the late 60's, and the sound quality is the worst I have ever heard. In fact, I can't figure out how they made it sound so bad. I have the original vinyls of most of these tracks, and there is absolutely no comparison. Perhaps they put a microphone up to the speaker of an old radio-phonograph, or maybe they transmitted it over a low-speed dial-up internet connection. Stay away! This thing shouldn't even be on the market, and the engineers who manufactured it ought to be put into the stockade at once."
4,Excellent book providing solid spiritual answers!,"JR McElfresh has done a tremendous job of articulating our daily 'war with choices.' All of us are invovled in a spiritual battle whether we realize it or not. Satan and his demonic forces are constantly at work trying to deceive, discourage and divide the Body of Christ. JR does a great job of helping us to better understand how to have victory in this relentless spiritual battle. This book is filled with solid biblical teaching and practical answers for everyday life!"
4,A roadmap for making positive choices,This book is a must read for those looking for guidelines in making positive choices. There are many negative forces in this world that try to deceive and destroy us. SpiritQuest will point out the different spiritual forces in this world and show how to find the positive forces. A great book for those searching for their significance in life. We all have many choices we make every day. This book is easy to read and will be helpful to any reader. The choice is yours.
2,Don't waste your money on these,These suck. They don't fit my face or the face of anyone I have tried to give them to.
5,A Masterpiece,"I saw this in a colleague's office and had to have a copy for myself. This is a beautifully written, concise overview of rheumatology. The author writes from personal experience; this is all practical material relating to diagnosis and treatment. It is almost 10 years old now, but from the standpoint of the practicing primary care physician, the vast majority of the material is still relevant. Much more enjoyable to read than the Arthritis Foundation text that I used in residency. Though unlikely, I'd like to see a new edition."
1,SEROOUSLY?!,"Ok! so uhm.. i give one star because im soo sad bout how i receive my books... i usually buy "" USED "" Manga! and it really looks fine! but then when i freaking receive it.. the volume 1 cover is cutted off... and i dun like it when something did that to a book i feel bad for the book.... i know its weird but IM BOOK LOVER! anyways! im not really ok with this... anyways.. i love the story.... =.="
3,Good history from the period. But definite slant.,"From the files of Sherlock Holmes to the history of the transvall..... I didn't know Doyle had done this piece. Nor did I realize he made multiple revisions as more ""facts"" were revealed to him.A great read in the beginning, and I want to stay away from any political stance for one party or another, but after a short period, it becomes overly clear that Doyle is writing as an Englishman first, and an historian second."
1,Boring,Too many facts... I haven't finished yet and had had it for almost a year and it took me almost 3 months to try to end the first chapter...
2,Too much detail,"This is not a bit like reading Sherlock. It has much too much detail to be an enjoyable or leisurely read. Every battle describe seems to have the names of all the officers, all the wounded, all the killed and all the units that fought. I believe the book would be more appropriate for serious detailed research, and that was probably it's intent."
3,"3stars,1/2,is righter:better things had to come afterwards!","Better things had to come afterwards,nevertheless this debut album is not bad ... first of all the excellent female vocal by Sonia Kristina is a true Curved Air trademark and, despite of the bad arrangement of a famous track by Vivaldi, the opening track ""It happened Today"" already shows the several sides of Curved Air's music!! A mixture of experimental folk music, with the support of a tasteful violin and such an emotional playing !! The best track of the album is the instrumental ""Rob one"", a true Darryl Way's imprinting, with a great feeling,under the same characteristics as the best stuff within this debut album...including the already mentioned opener.Not completely essential, but very interesting debut album-folk prog oriented!!"
4,This Band Comes at you from a different dimension,"Listening to It Happened Today, this group is creative, it jumps from one style where the band and Sonia are soaring and becomes like a meandering river. So much of their music was inovative, many guitarists would copy the licks on Stretch for years later. Screw is a real propduction that moves from one point to another gradually building in form. Such a good example of a well oiled machine."
1,this is NOT 3/4 length,this coat only extends to mid-thigh though the shoulder and arm length are correct. Everyone who has seen it has remarked about it so I have another expensive coat I won't be wearing outside rain or shine. mark cousart
4,Indomitable will,"Francis Chichester had many adventures in the air and on the sea. His motto may well have been ""crash, or crash through'. Chichester crashed his plane on this adventure - something he did on every flying adventure he undertook - and he just took it in his stride. He almost crashed his aircraft several other times.He was lost in the Australia outback with out water and with limited fuel, yet the man 'still came through'. This book displays his single minded desire to succeed, regardless of the risk.The pages do seem a bit like a boys own adventure. Nonetheless, it is a great read."
5,Haunting Classic,"This is a great album. It has a supernatural atmosphere to it that makes it different from anything else I've ever heard. Done a little differently, this would not be my cup of tea, however, the way they execute the music sold me from the first strains of Mary Antonette. It is mood music, to be sure, and it is certainly not heavy. However, it is great music and brings back memories of Spain in the early seventies. I think despite the rather primitive electronics (by today's standards, maybe) this album would do well today. Then again, it is probably not bland enough to be a hit album! Highly recommended."
5,"Succinct description, followed by sample lessons across several grade levels.",This book shows how to improve your approach to writing instruction. The students are highly engaged and thinking more critically about their writing.
1,Book doesn't address the subject title.,"I have read Mr. Chadwick's book and feel that his book is not a book about the Lord, but rather a book about himself. I was expecting the book to give me advice on how to be a better christian in my everyday life, but instead it is more of an autobiography about a man with many problems."
1,Not for me,"I dont like this book, it didnt really explain how to prepare for the Lord and his coming. He was just concentrating on himself.. I wouldnt recommend this book."
1,Not What I thought It was,"I thought it was going to help me prepare to obey, the laws of God and how to live a good christian life, to get us ready for his return."
2,Stay with the Lord!,"I wanted to write, about this book to let my family and friends know how powerful this book is. The truths on this book makes us believe that many people do talk and don't do the walk...the Lord Jesus Christ will lead us the the right direction if we do the walk and not just talk. People should trust the Lord Jesus Christ to do what ever they want just by trusting in him. Let him take control not you...and see what happens...everybody needs to live and do what God wants them to be, loyal, honest."
1,He is not walking!!!,"About the Book,I would love to know HOW! this book was published? This book is all about him and really not focusing on the title. I read all the reviews and I think people should save their money, buy a Bible, the story is there and about the Lord Jesus Christ! This book will tell the truth!! some of the readers!!! I'm sure feel as I do!!! tell the truth!!!one reader says it touches many lives? try touching many wifes!!!pray!!! and don't use the Lords name for your Prey!! I feel like the other readers review...This book is a work of fiction is more like it!!"
2,Displeased with product,"I also bought this product to accompany a Dell MP3 player. It fits fine in my car's tape deck, however, the tape makes a constant grinding noise while played. To drown out this noise, I would have to have the volume up very high on both the car stereo and the MP3 player. It is disappointing becuse I have yet to find a solution to the noise of the tape- cleaning the deck, cleaning the tape component... nothing seemed to work. I then bought Belkin's FM Tunecat II, also a large disappointment. Between the two choices, I would go with the tape deck, but beware, it isn't great."
1,Grinding Sound Unacceptable,"I just bought one of these. It amazed me that the sound quality was so good yet this product is totally unusable.As soon as it is inserted it begins to make a grinding sound. I am not even sure why that wheel is needed to engage with the deck motor. All that really should be needed is the head to match the deck head.It is not only annoying and loud, but I would worry it might eventually damage the deck.This is going back and I hope I can find something better."
2,"Great audio, but adapter makes constant grinding sound","Like some of the other reviewers, I was very impressed with the audio quality while simultaneously disappointed with the constant grinding sound that comes from the adapter itself. I even tried taking it apart to see if some WD40 would help, but I think the plastic pieces are simply rattling around while spinning in the car's cassette deck. I took one back to the store and the replacement makes the same annoying sound."
3,Noisy,My next car audio must have usb port to avoid using noisy item like this in order to listen to mp3 player.
2,Poor sound quality,"This product worked for my setup, but the sound quality was poor. Distortion started in with the volume halfway up. I have another brand and the distortion does not start until the volume is most of the way up. This is not the model to get."
2,you can do better than this...,"If you want a low-priced sampler of Johnny Cash, you might want to find one made by Sony. This here is an ill-considered cash-in by Universal, featuring re-recordings made in the 80's. For under ten dollars, there are a number of better discs available from Sony - _16 Biggest Hits_, _Greatest Hits Vol. 1_, _Super Hits_, _Giant Hits_, etc. These are preferable because, for the most part, they feature the original recordings."
4,Great Record,"This album should be in every Cash fan's collection. Although Johnny's earlier recordings are more famous, the Mercury recordings have a tempo and an energy that the earlier recordings lack."
4,220 Minutes of Superb Guitar Music,"This is young French-Canadian guitarist David Jacques' three-disc `tour de force' of playing the complete works of Robert de Visée (c. 1650 - c. 1732), court musician at Versailles to Louis XIV, the French `Le Roi Soleil'.De Visée was singer, teacher and player of the guitar, the lute, the theorbo and the viola da gamba, as well as composer of music. A rare compilation in itself, the two books of his guitar music survives with twelve suites - an informal collection of dances, written in the same key, intended to be played in a certain sequence.With David Jacques holding a doctorate on the different versions of manuscripts and transcriptions of Robert de Visée's guitar pieces - sometimes very different from the interpretations on the baroque five-course guitar - we can now assume we are hearing the authentic performance of these pieces played on a facsimile of a periodic baroque instrument."
4,Soul Love,"Patti LaBelle is still the ultimate R&B; survivor. Although, many people have written her off in place of divas like Britney Spears and Mariah Carey. Nonetheless, her sound is still as strong as it originally was introduced in the 60's and 70's.Her Greatest Love Songs collection, consists of 17 different songs by LaBelle including When You Talk About Love, The Right Kinda Lover, and I'm In Love Again. Some of the songs are still as dominant as before, but I was hoping that a track or two was released from Patti LaBelle's career with the Bluebelles and LaBelle. Nonetheless, this collection is still worth the money, especially for any romantic couple in the mood for soul love.There is still no doubt about it. Patti LaBelle is still one of the longest running successful singers in R&B; music today, and that is still the truth."
5,love pattie/wish i could fine this one song,i been a big fan of pattie since i was a little girl but it one song that i been look for from her and i just cant find it im hope byn put this review in that may be some body can tell me what the song is i though it wa look to the rain bow but i dont thank its that so if in one know what the song is could you please email me a let me know what it is i cant thank of how it gose all i know is she is holding this very long long long note at the end so if any body know what song im talk about please send to my email address it [...].
3,Not overly satisfied,I thought this album could have been better. I do like the songs but I wanted more of my favorites on it. but it's worth buying
2,Mega Blocks Castle,Nice castle set but it only comes with one knight. I couldn't find any of the accessory knights to go with it so will end up returning it- major disappointment.
5,an excellent analysis of modernization of warfare,This is one of the few books out there that even deals with the effect of the modernization of warfare on the Mamluk kingdom. His sources are excellent and the book even manages to be entertaining!
3,Track 1 is not correct.,"Fair warning...I purchased this only to then realize that Track1 is identical to Track5. Amazon was kind enough to refund the full purchase price, and I was able to buy the actual CD from a retailer. The songs themselves are very good and the quality is too, but I can't comment on the 'authenticity' of whether it was actually recorded live."
1,Oh puhleeze,"What exactly is it that Ms Wearstler does? This book is filled with ""glam"" pictures of recycled design ideas by Billy Haines,Dorothy Draper and Billy Baldwin,mostly of the ""Hollywood Regency"" style. Ms Wearstler,whose home it is, appears in the photos dressed to the nines and seems to want us to think that she dreamed up this nifty new look.Take a look at the new Billy Haines book and the just released book on Dorothy Draper and you'll see real designers at work AND whose work and style this really is."
1,Stylish Mess,"If you like pretty pictures, this might be a book for you. If you want a ""How To .."" book, save your money and just follow the author's own rules for decorating. Step One: Marry rich. Step Two: Buy an interesting house already furnished. Step Three: Add any other interesting furnishings you can find and not worry about whether it ""goes"" or not. Step Four: Hire a publicist, great photographer and stylist. If you follow these steps, you can be just like Kelly Wearstler!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I wish I had have taken notice of the other reviews. I loved Kelly's first book and found it very useful, however this book is entirely over-rated and I'm so pleased I didn't pay full price for it. There is absolutely no text in the book - just pictures from Kelly's house showcasing her furniture and herself and none of them look at all practical for everyday living. Save your money for the many other fantastic books on offer."
2,don't waste your money!!,"While I very much enjoyed Miss Wearstler's first book, I found Domicilium Decoratus to be borderline obnoxious. Rather than show great decorating, the book focused mainly on close up shots of objects in her house that took up the whole page.In addition, I feel that as the viewer of the book I do not need to see fifteen entire pages of Miss Wearstler dressed in ball gowns pretending to be domestic."
2,not what I expected,"I bought this book without really reading the description. my fault...but it isn't what I expected at all. I was thinking it would be like other mtv books, with lots of juicy info and glossy pages with pictures. It was all black and white expect for a few pages in the middle. It's almost like reading a teen book of stories...at times it's hard to believe these kids grew up to be such richy rich backstabbing teens. I love the show as a guity pleasure, but shouldn't have bought the book."
3,Was expecting more!,"I was hoping to get some real inside stuff in this book but this book fell below my expectations. There are some cute stories about how people met one another when they were kids but a lot of the stories are from when they were very young. I was hoping for more insight into their relationships when they were in high school. No good ""dirt"" in this book. If you are looking for some good childhood stories and memories from when they were kids then buy the book, if you are looking for more about the show and the drama, don't!"
3,"Remember the ""drama"" of junior high school? Want to relive those ""intense"" experiences?","If you do remember the ""drama"" of junior high, the ""intense"" experiences that in retrospect seem rather silly, then look no further than this collection of stories. If you watch Laguna Beach as a guilty pleasure and want that kind of heavy-hitting back-stabbing action, you might be a little disappointed. Any serious fan will enjoy learning the backstories of the real kids of Orange County, but otherwise the book is a little lacking.There are tons of pictures inside, but most are in black and white, except for a few glossies in the center section.The cover of the book states clearly ""Media Tie-In,"" so this book is advertised as exactly what it consists of. If you want a media tie-in and Laguna Beach is your favorite show, here you go. If you want racy drama, go watch the show, or, better yet, find another novel or story collection."
5,AWESOME!,I strongly recommend this book to everyone. I loved the book. It is full of stories that will push you to act in a way to get what you want. The time and money put out on this book is nothing compared to what you'll get out of it.
4,Achieve!,"This book helps a person to see how visualizing success leads to taking the actions which result in success. Positive thinking is a habit, which if cultivated, can change an individual's life for the better. The point is illustrated by a story attributed to Socrates. A stranger was asked what kind of people were in the city he left and he replied they weren't very nice, they were cheaters, liars, and those of similar nature. Socrates let the man know he'd find the same kind of people in Athens. A second man was asked about the kind of people he had experienced in his previous location and he said wonderful people. Socrates told him he would find the same kind of people in Athens. The moral is you see what you perceive you will find. Self-fulfilling prophecy can be found in personal relationships. Canfield and Hansen help their readers to see things from the perspective of the second person Socrates interviewed."
4,sterling silver bracelet,this charm bracelet was for a friend at work and she loved it. it was a good pick for me.
4,Lovely little bracelet,This is a beautiful little bracelet. I purchased it for a young girl who loves dolphins.
3,okay as an intro to London,"Spends about 15 seconds on each site. Narration is adequate and accurate, but not exactly exciting. With more detail and background stories for each site, it would be more interesting and more helpful."
2,MJV,"Nice size bag, just NO padding to protect your detector....good price on Amazon, I did end up buying another manufacturer bag due to the lack of padding."
1,It's a bag,"I ordered this bag based on the dimensions posted on Amazon. The bag is suppose to be 38 inches long.IT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO 38 INCHES. MORE DECEPTION .The bag itself is okay but is way too short for what I intended it for, it has very little padding and the nylon used is not that heavy. I could have gotten a better bag and one closer to the size advertised from one of the discount stores.I am not happy but I will keep the bag and remember this vendor."
1,The Emascilation of Men in America,"I was quite excited to have received the book till I read it. Though the author had a few valid points, they were very few. Going to the extent of blaming women for the lack homosexuality. Shouldn't we be thanking them?? Nonetheless I do not recomend this book."
4,Dog socks,These were as advertised. They were a gift and quite ahit with the recipent. I would order these again.
1,"Looks great, well intentioned, but marginal artistry","I ordered this CD based on the playlist, and upon receiving it was impressed with its graphic design and personal meditation written by Mr. Sowash in the accompanying pamphlet. But then I listened to this recording and was deeply disappointed. Mr. Sowash's touch on the piano is heavy, and densely filled. I enjoyed not one cut, even the songs I love. I don't want to be cruel, but in my opinion this is marginal artistry not deserving of wide distribution."
2,Boring,I can't finish this book. I can't put my finger on why I am not getting into it but I have read 10 other books in the time since I started this one. Just not entertaining. It never grabs you. I am not pleased with this purchase.
3,"COULD BE BETTER, COULD BE WORSE","DEMON'S GATE is a nice tight little fantasy revolving around `demons,' actually interdimensional travelers, and their desire to take over the human world. To do so they need humans to `open' the gates allowing them access to the human world, which technology wise is in the middle of the Bronze Age.The plot is fairly formula and the characters are rather one-dimensional caricatures of good barbarians and not so good imperials, bad priestesses and good sorcerers. As far as storylines go I've see much worse. It is a quick read with enough action and suspense that you'll probably want to read the next installment. There is also some, very slight mind you, hint of romance, but as with most of Whites books it is very, very little. Hey you read him for the war scenes anyway right?To be honest this is pretty average fare. While it isn't Mr. White's best it's good enough that I will RECOMMEND it"
2,"Say, Aren't You ...","An earlier reviewer already noted that one of the characters is clearly supposed to be an analogue for Belisarius. The entire novel is basically a take on an idea developed by Kenneth Hite in one of his ""Suppressed Transmissions"" columns, collected (if memory serves) in the first volume -- what if Justinian of Byzantium (as portrayed by Procopius) went to war with King Arthur? The author then does that one better by having the central protagonist be a thinly-disguised analogue for Hal Foster's Prince Valiant!While certainly amusing in segments, it's just too derivative to be taken seriously. And the concept of the relationship between extradimensional ""demons"" and mortal religion was used to much better effect in Gemmell's ""Winter Warriors""."
2,"Much bigger than 12""","The pan itself is fine, but it measures closer to 16"" in diameter. The cooking surface is 12"", but the pan has such a wide lip around it that it doesn't come close to fitting in my convection toaster oven."
5,great!,"I had been looking for a pizza pan that actually fit in my oven as the others I had were too big and the door wouldnt shut all the way. I also noticed that it cooked it more evenly. Being non-stick, it eliminated greasing the pan. For those that don't or can't cook on the stone, this is an excellant product. The price was great!"
5,It toots! It Chugs!,"Two way electronic 3D domino centerpiece toots and chugs like a train engine when you place the final domino in the center. Or flip the switch and it crows like a chicken. Holds dominoes in place during play. Use with your own double 9, 12, 15 or 18 dominoes to play Mexican Train or Chickenfoot.Also enclosed are 9 glitter-covered train markers, complete copyrighted rules and a 50-page Dual-Use Scorepad.Everything necessary to play the two most popular domino games, except the dominoes."
4,Great game. Only play sound when you want to annoy your opponent.,"This seems like a well built unit for the game and we love playing it. We've played it quite a bit and it hasn't broke down yet. But the only time we play the music is when we are trash talking and want to annoy someone hah!! No really, we play nice but the sound is annoying as all get out and the only fun time to play it is when you want to stir things up a bit."
5,Mexican Train Centerpiece,"I bought this centerpiece for a friend of mine for Mexican Train and Chicken Foot. She wanted one like I had gotten some years back, but the company must have changed the original. This one doesn't have the same slots for the toy train markers as mine does. It looks the same in the package, but it isn't. I don't know how the sounder is because she hasn't tested it as far as I know. It's nice to have the score pads with it. I just wish companies wouldn't change a winning item. Mine was included in my game and is fabulous."
5,Must have if you are playing mex train or chicken foot!,Excellent addition to the dominos! I'm so glad I bought this to go along with the domino set. Completes the game playing enjoyment. I see lots of Friday game nights in our future!
2,Too simplified and sometimes inaccurate,"Being interested in geology and a native of North Carolina, I was initially excited about ""The Years Before Man"". But, like the previous reviewer said, too much information is crammed into this relatively short book -- the entire geologic history of NC is too complicated to be confined to ~200 pages. The result is a watered-down geologic history of NC, some of which is outdated and inaccurate.On the other hand, Fred Beyer has written an easy-to-read book on a subject that isn't always easy to understand. For someone with a casual interest in geology, ""The Years Before Man"" is an excellent start to understanding the complex geologic history of NC. Otherwise, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
2,Interesting but limited,The author attempts to cover a billion + of geology and paleontology in a very modest-sized book. The result is that both are treated on a very superficial level. It compares especially unfavorably with the new Geology of Pennsylvania (`600 pages) that sells for only $20...
3,not really just for two,"I am a single person and am constantly on the lookout for recipes for smaller portions or less people. I was disappointed in this book as not all the recipes are scaled down for two. For example, chocolate cake gives 10 servings, crepes 12-15, apple pie 8 servings, asparagus tart 6-8 servings, etc."
1,"Promising, but Buggy Software","APA-Style Helper 3.0 claims to allow a user to create a manuscript by prompting the user for the title, running head, author, abstract information, and all of their references. After the user provides this information APA-Style Helper 3.0 creates a rich-text file that Microsoft Word can read - it fully supports paragraph styles.The user encounters problems when entering references. If you edit a reference in your manuscript, your first reference is lost. If you add a reference after saving, closing the software, and opening it again, you lose two of your first references.APA-Style Helper 3.0 is a very promising package, but the vendor's lack of testing is very disappointing considering this problem was discovered after adding only three references. The APA is aware of the problems and promises a patch is on the way.Avoid APA-Style Helper 3.0 until version 3.1 or a patch for 3.0 is released."
2,"Not very good, unless you know what you are doing!","I bought this, because my proffesor told us that we had to switch from 4th edition APA to the 5th half-way during the semester, without instructions on what was new! Well, I found this a very hard program to use. I basically used it to do my references. I found it very hard to save my manual as a Word document. The instructions provided are not very easy to folow, and even when you have finished your manual, and saved it as a Word document, you will still have to play around with the Word doc to correct some of the ""assumptions"" that this program makes. All in all, this is good when you are in a pinch, but it is not reliable enough to use for all of your papers."
1,Style-Helper does not work,"After entering all of the required information in both the title page area and the reference area, the software fails to open the selected word processing program (Microsoft Word 2000). The references are lost if you try to modify them and they do not format properly. You cannot just print off the references, which I tried to do when Word would not open. Essentially all of my work was ""lost"" and I had to make multiple screen prints of the entries and try to recreate them from scratch. I am surprised that better quality control and testing was not done before marketing this product. I contacted ""help"" on the apa website on 1/26/02 and to date (2/17/02) have never had anything other than an automatic response to my inquiry for assistance. They promised to follow-up in 24 hours, but never did."
1,A waste of money,"This product was a complete waste of money. The reference entry facility isn't integrated in with your word processor, and the user interface is, to put it very politely, poorly designed. A nightmare of a software product. There are other APA style software products out there that do a much better job, notably StyleEase. Take a look at it or other products before even considering buying this product."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS OR VERSION 5,"A terrible waste of time and money. In fact, embarrassing to the computer profession, and to the psychological profession too. You can do better with 30 minutes of training in Word from a friend."
4,Specialty Item,I haven't had the opportunity to use this item yet. Tiffen makes good filters for photographers. It can only be used in landscape photography where you want to see richer colors and dramatic lighting in the sky. I'll give it a shot one of these days.
5,Awesome filter!,"Had this filter a little over a month now, and mainly use it for landscape shots. Images that are produced while using it seem to be clear and crisp with no distortion that I can see. Item arrived promptly, and was packaged with care. There were no visible scuffs or scratches on the filter. I guess Tiffen lived up to their name again! I would highly recommend this product!"
4,Great product for the price,I have no problems with this product in the few times that I have used it so far. In hindsight I would have gotten a step up ring and gotten a 77mm filter as with a UV and the ND filter you get vignetting at wide angle.
1,The worst constructed filter I've seen in my life time.,"The worst constructed filter I've seen in my life time. Extremely thick. Its light weight makes me doubt if it is really made from glass. The mount ring can move sidewards for about 1mm apart from the glass ring, because it is made from a piece of plastic[...] When mounted on lens, it is really too loose to keep it from dancing. It's already full of dust between the glass ring and the mounting ring before I took it out from the shipping box, which make rotating a painful feeling. Avoid any rotation needed filter made by Tiffen!!!!!! Perhaps, any filter from Tiffen. Go B+W or Heliopan, they won't cost you much more but you'll see what a truly beautiful filter should look like. [...]"
3,Does what its intended,I now wish I would have gone for the interchangeable filters with varying degrees of density.Biggest turn off to this product is that it has a tendency to get stuck on the lens.
5,A must have....,...for anyone wanting to improve their photos. This pretty much eliminates that awful whited out sky often seen in landscape photos. I do a fair amount of traveling and this filter has saved many photos. (and cut down on post time in photo shop) I can't always keep to the dawn/dusk timelines when I'm with vacationing with family.
4,Nice Value,Well built filter that arrived on time. I recently used it shooting a nice sunset at Point Lobos State Park CA. Definitely helped with foreground exposure. I would recommend it.
1,Counterfit?,This is the first Tiffen filter I have purchased that does not stack with other filters. Also the product markings on the side of the filter does not match my other Tiffen filters. Finally there was no brochure included with the filter. All of this makes me suspicious that it is a counterfit.
5,Great round graduated filter for the price,"I use this filter with my Nikon kit lenses. Works very well, but you by design, it is less graduated with the lens zoomed in. I take it with me every time I shoot outdoors and use it as often as my polarizer. I just keep it in the case that it came in, but if that ever breaks I will need to find a good filter case to protect this beauty because I do plan on keeping it :)"
1,Bad and useless,This is a review of the:Tiffen 52mm Color Graduated Neutral Density 0.6 FilterBottom-line: useless. It makes no difference for exposure. A cheap equivalent cokin works much better than this.This filter is pretty much useless. I've recently bought a cokin grad neutral density 0.6 and is much better than this useless piece of glass. It makes absolutely no difference in my pictures (while the equivalent cokin one works fine).My suggestion is: stay away from this and save your money.
4,Janice the Pill - lol,I liked this story's treatment about fake girls like Janice whom parents can't see through. I also enjoyed Claudia's exhausting bad day near the end of the book. Claudia might have Asperger's Syndrome!
5,A Masterpice,"Mr. Hagedorn has done it again. A meticulously researched and lavishly illustrated book. Information on the wars of Latin America have always been sketchy at best, and detail on the air wars nearly non-existent. In this volume, Mr. Hagedorn blends concise text with the photos to create a wonderful history. And thats not all! Available on-line to purchasers of the book is an expanded text for each chapter, well over 300 pages. Readers of this book should also obtain his Aircraft of the Chaco War book. Cheers and praise to Mr. Hagedorn!"
4,Great book,"I liked this book. It has plenty of contents related toLatin American warplanes and their use in so many unknown conflicts. It has a download section, however I would have apreciated more if they were included in the book. Some profiles are not really accurate, but the bulk of information fills a gap in one delivery, making it worth purchasing this release. I'd strongly recommend it to those modellers looking to make unusual colour schemes of Mustang, Corsair and many more."
3,callers complain of background noise,"I bought this at costco for $30. It's much more comfortable than I would ever have imagined, but I'm not happy with the ergonomics; it takes six seconds holding down the button to turn it on or off, and if outdoors the led indicator washes out so I don't know if I've turned it on or off.People say they hear lots of background noise when I use it in my car with the windows rolled up on the highway. So I'm looking to return it for one with better sound quality."
1,Poor Quality,The hinge on this scope cover broke within the first two hours of use. It was in the open position but I was sitting on a stump while deer hunting. The only contact with anything would have been my wool coat as I readjusted my seat slightly over those 2 hours. I bought my first Butler Creek cover some 15 years ago and it performed well even though I normally still hunt with the cover in the open position. I should have listened to the other customers who complained about recent quality problems. DO NOT waste your money.
5,Full of expression,"This Franck piece flows beautifully from start to finish. The combined clarity and understanding between both Ashkenazy and Perlman generates complete balance in phrasing and smoothness in the lyricism. Perlman captures the lilting drama while the piano adds softness and a dream quality to it. I have never heard this piece better performed.The Brahms also has a ""swept off thy feet"" sensation to it. A bit more energetic, it also flows beautifully and the french horn played by Tuckwell is another added delight.To those who may not be familiar with classical chamber music, these pieces are a bit more cerebral than say Mozart or Haydns' music whose beauty and genius is often in the simplicity with a melody and themes that may be easier to follow. The formula here is more complex. But it is so full of emotion and expression that this coupled recording is really beautiful to listen to. If the first time through doesn't hook you, give it a few more times - it will."
3,It was a good start,"I like this book from the start. It really hooked me in the first several chapters. The only down side to it was that wished the author had expanded the main character more the older she grew. On the whole I lked the book and would recommend it to a friend. This author's writing has come along way in the last several years. I look forward to her writing another book, maybe even keeping these chacters."
3,my old review is not longer showed,"When i bought this watch, several months ago, the watch was not set properly when leaving the production line, that showed to me a total and fatal lack of care to a product that can be treated with more respect, well i sent it to be fixed at a local jewerly store, and they did it well...now the watch is working as supoused to be...keep great time, has a nice look and the indiglo is one great and usefull invent.But i dont know how my old review is not longer showed."
5,Superb purchase,"I replaced the existing small Onkyo speakers that came with my Onkyo home theater system, I had read many positive reviews on these Polk Audio speakers and couldn't wait to try them. What a surprise when I hooked them up. My system came to life with crisp and clean sound. My system sounds so much better. I am hearing subtle sounds that just were not audible before. Every time I turn on my tv I can't help to notice the rich sound. I think the price on the five speakers was very fair for what you receive. I kept my Onkyo powered sub which seems to work fine with the other five matched speakers. I had no problem attaching them to my existing speaker stands. These speakers have some weight to them but they are fine with the stands. So don't look any further than these Polk Audio's for the best sound."
2,poorly manufactured,Sound quality is fine. Input for speaker wire manufactured poorly. Have used many speakers before but never had so much difficulty getting the speaker to lock onto the speaker wire.
2,"Works when battery is depleted ""dead,"" but not when battery is worn out dead","This works, but you you have to realize its limitations.It will let you get enough charge into a well-working car battery in order to start the car.It will not, however, let you move enough power from one car to another to start a car that currently has an old, broken or worn out ""dead battery."" For that you'll still need jumper cables, an AC starter or a jump box to get a car going that has a truly dead battery.This product is a great, safe idea, and it'll let you get a car going when someone let the battery run down, BUT, it will not let you jumpstart a car when its battery has died due to age or malfunction of the battery itself.To summarize : Great when someone left their headlights on, worthless when someone's battery has given up the ghost for good."
4,pumps twice as fast as my 52 year old Crane Deming.,"I won't be around to see if this one lasts as long, but it certainly does it job..... One thing to note: the discharge is 3/4 in. not 1 in. Most tanks have a 1 in. inlet, as did the one I purchased with this pump.... No big deal, but just be ready for it. The pump with a new bladder tank runs about half the amount of time as did the old setup.It's hard to compare the sound factor as my old pump was screaming and whistling. Old ears , you know."
4,Revlon vs others,"I have one extremely strong like for this item over the other 2 I own (I will not name brands)-this one melts the paraffin COMPLETELY in 2 hours, whereas the others can take up to 18 hours to melt! I am so busy, that I can hardly plan a meal 18 hours in advance, nonetheless the use of a beauty item. The only reason I did not give this a 5-star rating is this-I wear size 10 shoes (Women's), and it would be perfect for my feet if it were even just an inch longer. I was able to fit my entire foot in, but I would prefer not having to worry about my heel or toes touching the inside of the basin. I did not have any mishaps, so other size 10's should be able to fit their foot in."
1,ARE THEY CRAZY???,"I find it absolutely astonishing that a book with a LIST price of $9.95 is posted for sale of USED copies at prices ranging from $115.xx to $199.xx.For that money, I would expect to see the book delivered by Armored car with a multitude of heavily armed guards!!"
2,"Nice Pictures, Not much for Content","I got this book based on the great Amazon reviews. I read some of it, and went back to check and see if had received the right book, I had, so I went back and tried to read the rest and then gave up. The book talks about how any home can be ""distinctive"", but the pictures are all of homes on $3 million dollar lots looking out over the ocean, etc. Overall the book was mediocre, not much in the way of content and kind of self-congratulatory.The thing that kind of upset me was the reviews. Short of this guy having paid people to give the book great reviews, I just can't figure out what book these reviewers were reading."
3,I couldn't wait to get my hands on the book...,"But, sadly I was dissapointed. I recently updated a 'distinctive' home, I cannot think of anything more distinctive that a classic American farmhouse, yet IMO the homes feaured were cold. The Author writes well and is tops at his craft but I was expecting something else. I agree w/ other reviews it pertains more to new construction rather than restoring a historic home."
4,wonderful,"A lovely collection of shots. I am pleased with the dvd transfer. The only thing I'd ask the makers: why so short? (30 mins). I'm sure NASA has years of footage, it's such a view to share with folks that will never make it there..."
2,Very little bang for the $.,"I purchased this mouse about a year ago when my laptop touch pad began giving me problems. Once I was finally able to get the mouse and receiver to sync I was pleased. One thing that was immediately apparent was that I was going through batteries like crazy. I would even pop the battery out when it was not in use, but that did not help at all. Also the battery compartment would not always close correctly. Maybe this was just with my specific mouse, but what I would have to do was hold the batteries down myself and then close the compartment (vs sliding on). After about 2 months I began to have trouble syncing the receiver and mouse. I would have to unplug the receiver, plug it back in, and try to resync again. During this time period I began to have trouble with the mouse actually moving correctly, so I purchased another brand. Needless to say this was not one of my better investments."
3,Batery compartment won't keep batteries properly locked,"I had a really hard time to properly insert the batteries as the inner spring kept on pushing them out. Once I did (placed a small piece of paper inside) there hasn't been a problem with it.In addition, I'd like to point out that it DOES NOT look the same as the one shown in the advertisement. It is a bit larger and bulkier. The wheel protrudes a lot from the rest of the mouse and it is not as slim as I'd have liked. I purchased 2 units from Ace Photo Digital -marketplace seller here in amazon- and they are both identical but do not match the picture in the ad.It is a shame because I ended up buying these mice based on : 1) a friend of mine has it and told me it ran for 6 months (using it mon-fri) before he had to change the batteries and 2) The size/look was really nice and convenient for light traveling.I'd have given it a 2 star review if it hadn't been working so nice with my laptop running XP Pro."
2,Could use some design improvements...,"We bought this stroller to go with the Companion carseat (which I love), and I'm less than happy with it... yes, it does the job, but there are a couple things that drive me nuts:-No cupholder... really this sounds small, but try pushing this and carrying your waterbottle at the same time... doesn't work!-my feet hit the wheels constantly, and gimme a break, I'm only 5'2"". I feel for the longer-strided tall mommies.-The backrest has to be laid back to put in the carseat and it blocks the storage underneath.On the plus side, I love the fabric, and the bag is a nice addition. The five point harness is especially nice, with an adjustable strap between baby's legs.All in all, If I had it to do over I probably would try a different britax stroller."
3,"Ok, but not forever...","I bought this to match the Companion car seat--which is fantastic, and I highly recommend. However, this stroller is a steering nightmare and I've finally had it. Pluses: the extra bag is nice, easy to fold (but takes two hands), compact, light, easy to travel. Cons: Front wheels get stuck, seat is uncomfortable, no tray or cup holder for mom or baby, fabric does not clean well and is not removable, and when it's folded it actually takes up a lot of space. And I have to say, I got this stroller for $75 for a discontinued color, and even when I bought it new the most I saw it for was $140. Definitely do not spend $495 for this! It's so off, I'm actually wondering if it's a mistake on the website."
2,fell short in steering,"good points: easy fold, adjustable foot rest is wonderful, reclining, bag and basket, handle bar useful. VERY DISSAPOINTED in the poor steering. It is hard to turn.....shopping cart syndrome. Developed tendinitis of the elbows 'cause of this."
2,Where do I start....,"Ok, I bought this stroller because one of the plastic clips broke off of the seatbelt of my zooper twist stroller so I thought I would try another brand of stroller, big mistake. For one thing this is a full size stroller with an umbrella fold so it's pretty heavy. The other thing is that when I went to fold it up the hood that doesn't really work anyway, pops right off the frame and is in the way of the clamp that keeps the stroller together. Yet another thing is that when I walk my feet kick the wheels! I am only 5'3""! The handles are definitely too short. I did like the diaper bag that hung on the back of the stroller and the basket underneath was pretty big for this type of stroller. The very deep recline was a plus too but I returned this stroller and bought another zooper twist."
2,Not very comfortable for my son!,"I chose this stroller for the Britax name (good quality), and because I needed a stroller that was lightweight and not too expensive (keeping it at my parents' place in Maine). In general I think it's all right, but it's quite annoying to open and close, and the handles aren't really high enough (but I think this is a problem with many strollers). My main complaint is that the back doesn't go upright enough, so my son has to be half-way reclined when he's in it. It doesn't look very comfortable for him, and he much prefers his usual stroller that has 3 positions, including one that is bolt upright. This stroller has 2, and the lying-down position is fine when he's sleeping, I just wish the ""upright"" position was actually upright."
2,Britax Preview Stroller,"This stroller looks nice and has a lot of stroller storage. I like the extra storage that hangs from the handles. It rolls easily. My complaints are that it is heavy, it is hard to open and hard to close. The first time I used it, it took me 10 minutes to get it open, and no I'm not stupid. We bought this to go with our Britax Companion carseat which we aren't real crazy about either. The carseat snaps in okay, but it normally takes a couple of tries to get it in securely. My last complaint is that the handles don't come up enough for me and I am 5'6. I would recommend trying out another brand after our experiences."
4,Great Resource!,"I am an LD Resource teacher in an elementary school and this is a great resource for reinforcing basic math skills. Students enjoy playing the games and are practicing their skills, as well. It is also nice because you don't spend a lot of money for some great games."
4,Black and White Print,"The book is creative and fun and my students will enjoy it. However, I assumed the pages were printed in color and they are not. They are all black and white so I am having to color them all myself in order to laminate them and get the ready for school."
1,Poor product,"I bought these ""instant"" file folder games for my autistic son thinking they were truly ""instant"". However, to my major disappointment, the pages are black and white with the ""suggestion' that you color them in with your students or children. It would be a TON of work to do that and in black and white the games to not hold his interest. Waste of money. I have found other truly 'instant"" file folder games that are precolored in, but they still require cutting and laminating, which can be very expensive. Don't buy this product."
1,Also Wrong Item Shipped,"I read the review for this product (the one where the wrong item was shipped) and assumed it was a one-time deal. Unfortunately the exact same thing happened to me! I, too, was sent the foosball table!! Why they alow this to continue to happen is beyond me! Beware!!"
1,Wrong Item Sent,"I wish I could review this product but the fact is I was sent the wrong product. I was sent a foosball tabletop game which was $10.00 less than the product I ordered, but I was charged the higher price. By the time I realized the mistake I couldn't send it back because it was too close to Christmas. So I would not recommend ordering from this company!"
3,Little over priced,"I used to buy these all the time for my taffy addicted mother at our local 7-11, but they stopped carrying it a while ago. So it's nice to see this product on amazon, however, compared to the 7-11 price, the price here just seems inflated. At 7-11 it was 4 ropes for $1 but increased to 3 for $1 later on. That would put 24 at $6 or 24 at $8. $12.60 is a little too much.The price for the 96 pack is much better though:Wonka Laffy Taffy Banana Rope, 0.81-Ounce Packages (Pack of 96)$19.44 for 96 puts it at $.20 per rope, much better than over $.50 per rope with the 24 pack.-2 stars for pricing."
2,Old Enough to Crunch and The Great Reviews are From the Seller!,"I felt like the information about this product was a little misleading, once it arrived. Maybe it ships as 5 pounds, but it's just over a pound of product in actuality. I'm glad it shipped free, because the individual pieces were marked ""3/99cents....which makes the $9.49 price slightly MORE than retail.Then when I tried one, it was crunchy, which tells me this is not fresh product. Still edible? Absolutely. Still the Laffy Taffy banana flavor I like? Absolutely, but I won't be buying this again. I live in Alaska, and I can buy over-priced candy right here at home."
3,stale very stale,Not sure how long these were in the warehouse but they are very stale and not too chewy. Actually I buy this sort of taffy all the time at my local walgreens and it's soft and taste perfect! Banana is a great flavor but the boxes amazon sales I have to question how old they are because this wasn't very fresh at all.
5,Old fashion goodness,I always hate to buy the bag just to get to the banana and also feel that one small one was not enough. We really enjoyed this candy.
5,"Special, Special","This CD is after Candido Fabre went solo.I want to emphasize that Los Originales have a really unique sound. It is almost like cumbia, they rock-steady. Most of the songs are slow and steady -----awesome and very danceable. They are really something special. This CD has some GREAT tracks. I don't think GREAT really does justice to the best tracks on this CD. Do you have some songs that are really special, that you don't listen to all of the time, that you only put on when you know you can pay attention and really listen to them? There are probably 3 of those on this CD for me."
3,Nostalgia ..,Just bought this for nostalgic reasons. Watched it when I was much younger. Still a good movie and I've always liked Linda Purl.
4,Older Christmas Movie,"I watched this movie many years ago and remember liking it, I had forgotten that there was a movie before this one about the couple so I was a little confused at first but it came back to me. A Movie with values."
1,Young Pioneers' Christmas,This is obviously a very old movie. the color was bad and the film moved constantly where you felt like you had missed most of the movie as it was a blur on the TV and all other movies play fine. So I don't know if movie if defective or just bad. I bought so I opened it and played it so now I am stuck with a worthless piece of junk.
2,Graceless translation,I have this and the Hargitai translation and private translations done by friends. I deeply regret buying this one: the translation is stilted and graceless. It is good to be honest to the original but if you don't also create fluent melodic poems you fail to capture what the originals deliver to those for whom it is their native tongue. I found no pleasure in reading this because the translations fail as poems.
5,Great for Large to Xlarge Dogs!,"I previously bought the 8"" Jolly for my 75 pound pitbull and she loved it. I got it at Christmas and it's still going strong. It has tons of tiny holes in it but has not deflated. I decided to get the bigger one for her to play outside with so I got this one. I would say she likes the 8"" one better then the 10"" but either way they are indestructable!"
1,Not as described!,"This jolly ball is NOT scented! ABSOLUTELY NO SMELL WHAT SO EVER! I COULD OF BOUGHT THE REGULAR JOLLY BALL ALOT CHEAPERVERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTED BUYER AND MY DOBERMAN IS DISAPPOINTED TOO"
3,Ruby Hookah (Nice with a few problems),Very nice looking and works decnt enough. Not as airtight as I would have liked. Seems to not seal well between the stem and the base.All in all I have enjoyed this product. Especially for the price.
5,You will be shocked how pretty this is!,"I NEVER would have thought that a yellow eyeshadow would look decent on me. I got this shadow as part of a larger kit a long time ago, and I just tried it one day. It does not look the same on the eyelids as it does in the container. On your eyes, it is translucent and glowing, like you would look in candlelight. It makes my eyes look so much more well rested and bright. I absolutely love this to wear to the office with a matte brown in the crease and outer corners. Try this color. You won't believe how beautiful it is. Oh, and my container has lasted me 3 YEARS with occasional use. I'm not even joking about that. It isn't even close to being empty, still."
2,Generic,"I was really disappointed when I heard this CD. I have been collecting the solo CDs by Ian Dogle (the OTHER percussionist from Ancient Future) and they are all really great. So, I saw a used copy of Benjy Wertheimer's ""Circle of Fire"" at a good price and thought I would take a chance on it. My reasoning was that if I had such good luck buying CDs by one Ancient Future percussionist I would probably have luck with the other percussioinist too. I was wrong.This CD comes off like generic, over-produced new age music, with rhythms that sound more like rock than like the various cultures that you would expect from the instrumentation. It is also very dramatic and cheesy, sort of like the stage antics of David Copperfield."
1,product needs work,"I got this clock because the alarm sounds are called chimes, cathedral bells, and something else I can't recall, but it turns out they are all very annoying. I really wanted a Zen clock that wakes you up with an actual chime but couldn't afford it. I thought this might be a nice replacement. I've been very disappointed. As others mentioned, the nature sounds are way too loud and can't be adjusted. I haven't used that feature since the first week I bought it. I'm now in the market for a new clock. The alarm sounds are driving me crazy!"
2,no quality assurance check on this clock,"I bought this clock and tried it for 2 nights. However, I was awaken by the clock 1 hour ahead of actual time. I realised later that the manufacturer has messed up on the program in this clock. Instead of 60 seconds per minute, this alarm clock was internally set at 50 seconds per minute..."
3,Its ok,The pin was really looks great however it didn't last long and the tip was broke. I guess the quality wasn't that good
2,noisier than expected,I intentionally bought a Casablanca because they were reportedly 'the best' and quiet.. this has quite an annoying hum. Louder than the one I replaced it with. Not so happy!
5,Excellent,"Acturally I have one before when I wasin China. When I was 15 years old I purchased this one DVD, now just want to get another copy. Beautiful scenes, excellent photograph, and first-class music. Especially in the last part, the electric instruments coupled with traditional Japanese instruments, wonderful music, can't depict the cmbination perspicuously, but you'll get astonised from the peace, however with power of nature and human intelligence.Definitely worth to buy!"
3,Housing pulled out of socket,"The extension cord was shipped quickly and arrived in expected condition. However, after light use the blue cord outer housing began to back out from one of the clear sockets. I've tried repeatedly to reinsert it back into the socket end but it inevitably pulls out again after one use. The extension cord still works fine and I'll just have to keep an eye on the exposed wires near the socket head."
2,"What a piti,concert and interviews mixed together","Blake Shelton is a great country artist, ironicly he mention in one of the disturbing interviews how proud he is, that fans buy his records. Has it been to my knowledge that this dvd-concert was destroyed by interrupting interviews after every single track, I would not have spent a single dollar on this dvd. Why can't the producers seperate interviews and other extra fottage to a bonus content and let the fans enjoy the concerts without interruptions. Very dissapointing for such a good artist."
4,Great Little Book,Book arrive in the condition as advertised. The book itself has all the traditional cream cheese recpies made from scratch. Very traditional and very good.
5,NO NOT 5 STARS 6 STARS,I DONT HAVE ENOUGH WORDS TO SAY ABOUT THIS CD. JUST GO BUY IT THIS IS A GREAT CD BEST OF 2006 SO FAR. ALSO IF U CAN SEE THIS GUYS LIVE THEY PUT ON A HELL OF A SHOW U DONT EVEN HAVE TO LIKE THEM. BUT THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE IF U LIKE METAL DEATH METAL BLACK GOTH IT IS JUST A GOOD CD TO HAVE. PICK IT UP U WILL LOVE IT
1,Very Boring.,"This cd very boring, never like old Moonspell albums. It's too watered down and artistic. It really seems like they tried a little too hard to be ""different"" and ended up being boring. I am dissapointed.I think good idea to work for newness. I appreciate to their effort. But this album boring.Subject for me!"
2,Boo,"This cd has nothing that old Moonspell used to have. It's too watered down and artistic. It really seems like they tried a little too hard to be ""unique"" and ended up being boring. I am pretty dissapointed."
4,Old school little mermaid,"I've had this movie since i was little and watched it many times. I have to say this is the most chilling version i've seen (partly because of the dubbing of the voices not lining up with the animation, but the music definitely adds another layer of emotion to the story). The good part of the movie is that it stays true to the actual story. I personally wouldn't reccomend it for younger children, but i may just be more sensitive than most. It really is an emotional movie; it will give you chills, make you laugh, and (particularly at the end) make you cry. Just as a warning, the animation is quite dated and is in anime style."
4,Should be taught in Schools,"A previous reviewer wrote that ""the author's conclusion is rarely heard of in established circles, and should be taken with a lot of salt."" The very reason to read this book is that the ""established circles"" at any point in history have a track record of consistently being ""wrong"" when viewed retrospectively. So it is dangerous to attach credibility to conventional wisdom as spouted by tenured scholarship....in almost any field or topic. Leave that to students who need to please their professors. It is a fine book. Read it."
2,Avoid this seller,"So I ordered 3 of these for myself set in a review of 3 stars initially. They are cheap but they are handy. Then the seller contacted me and asked me to reconsider changing their rating to a 4. (Claiming that all they do is resell the product). Well, I don't like this approach. I am rating the product, not so much the seller. If other consumers need to know about the quality of the product, they expect the reviews to be accurate. So I am still giving the product a 3...but the seller a 1 star rating. Just for contacting me and asking me to help their rating better. I will average this at a 2. If I am contacted again, I will drop it to a 1 star as it can go no lower. Just how high should I rate a $5 cheap comb that probably only cost pennies to manufacture? It is what it is."
3,Moderately Useful,Well made. Fits in a wallet. Could be somewhat useful but I never had a need to comb my beard or stash while out. At home I use a regular comb.
5,It does what it does!,"So, it's meant to comb your 'stach and beard and it does. Really well. If you are using mustache and beard wax this little comg will rake it right thru your beard and style it quickly. It cleaans up well and appears to be fairly well made. I recommend it."
3,The Pictured Comb is incorrect.,"The product is NOT as pictured. The combs I received (set of 3) more closely resemble a cheap knock off of the Tweezerman comb. They'll do the job but the tweezerman comb is higher quality. As a side note, the printed description is more accurate. But they need to update the picture."
4,"very good tribute to JFK (and some great vintage footage, too)","I recommend this dvd for all lovers of JFK. I especially liked the comments of Dave Powers, Red Fay, and Carol Channing. That said, the main reason to get this dvd is for the vintage footage, especially the high-quality segment from Love Field 11/22/63 wherein Secret Service agent Henry J. Rybka is waved off the rear area of the limousine by ATSAIC/ Shift Leader Emory P. Roberts (as discovered by myself in 1991 and shown on The Men Who Killed Kennedy, again by myself, in 2003).Vince Palamara-JFK/ Secret Service expert (History Channel, author of two books, in over 30 other author's books, etc.)Pittsburgh, PABEST JFK ASSASSINATION BOOK: ULTIMATE SACRIFICEBEST JFK SECRET SERVICE BOOK: SURVIVOR'S GUILT BY YOURS TRULY :)"
5,JFK,"although this is an old documentary, it is very nicely done, & having it presented by James Earl Jones is a nice touch as he has the greates voice in the world. Highly recomend to any JFK fan."
3,neat but expensive,"feels very weird. Its like a slimy bag on your foot. Use it before you go to bed at night (so you dont have to walk in them) I have EXTREMELY cracked feet in the summer due to wearing flip flops 24/7 and nothing beats a pedicure and a foot scraping (gross, I know) but these really do provide good relief. I've had these for over a year and they still work just as well as they day I opened them. However, its expensive and I dont use them that often (if my feet get that bad, I go get a scrub) and I wouldn't buy another pair if these wore out or got lost. But buy em once and see for yourself...!"
1,Claimed Good - Should of Been Claimed Bad,On Page 180- 215 The book was torn up in the center of the page like a pen was scribbled till it went through the page. Book was written on a little so that would claim it good but the torn middle made it horrible.
5,From a teacher's perspective: Best Algebra Book in Print,"I've been teaching math for 10 years and tutoring longer. Twice I've been awarded teacher of the year and I've been very involved in determining the accreditation of other high schools. I've seen a lot of algebra texts. This is the best text book from which I have ever taught. It gives excellent explanation for the student and the ancillary materials available to the teacher are great. It's a total winner. No complaints. I believe in this book so much that I just purchased a class set, with my own funds, for my son's private school.Mr D"
4,Great book for self study,"I bought this book from Amazon Marketplace for my 10-year-old son who wants to teach himself basic algebra. This book serves the purpose well. It explains the concepts clearly and thoroughly. With lots of examples and exercises, this book is great for self study."
3,Will do the trick.,I am trying to review my basic algebra skills and bought this textbook. I am glad that I was able to find it used. It has some pretty good explanations. My only criticism is that most of the problems are not very challenging. I see that this book is used in some charter schools and I am a little concerned that the students are working on problems that are at most mildly challenging.I have two other algebra 1 books and those have more challenging problems which allow you to apply concepts learned and go to the next level.
4,God is at work!,"This book is a tremendous encouragement for the dedicated Christian who is presently struggling to understand why God seems to be so silent. Someone has said that ""God whispers to us through our pleasure but shouts to us through our pain."" Dave Shive's testimony is a living example of that truth. What a blessing to know that the Lord's most significant work in our lives is often disguised in trials and difficult circumstances. I read this book two years ago, but I wasn't experiencing a ""night shift"" of my own at the time. Now that I am, I have pulled it out again and have found comfort and understanding through its insights. All believers will endure their own ""night shifts"" at one time or another. When others offer no-so-helpful advice like ""have more faith,"" this book will provide some clear perspective. Keep it nearby."
2,What is the point?,"This is the first John Ringo novel I've read - or heard of, for that matter. I love the character of Barbara Everette. I don't even mind all the heavy preaching going on in the book. My issue is that the entire middle section of the book lacks action. First ninety-one pages hooked me; lots of action, lots of humor, thrills, suspense, etc. The next hundred and fifty pages were a major snore-fest, but the action did pick back up during the last fifty pages. I am on the fence about the author; I loved the character when she had something to do; but the book itself I am not a fan of. It's put me off enough that I will probably not buy another Ringo novel - but if someone GIVES me one I'll probably read it ... the first fifty pages of it, anyway."
1,Shoddy Writing from a Usually Good Author,"I managed to get two thirds of the way through this book before I just gave up. The two reasons that I went that far with the book is that I got interested in the main character and I kept confirming to myslef that this was a Ringo book.The plot was a mess and kept getting worse. The first short story is pretty interesting. The second ""story"" bogged down in lots of boring scifi/fantasy conference stuff. It was more boring than reading the minutes of run-of-the-mill business meeting.Also, I didn't appreciate the author using the main character to advance his religious beliefs espically in the middle of the ""second"" story in the book (e.g., the husband is the ""king"" of the household, etc.).If you are really curious check this one out in the library and save your money.I'm going to have to really check out my next potential Ringo book prior to purchase."
1,Fool me once etc.,After tossing ghost in the trash (literally) after having only gotten halfway thru the I should have known better and not bought another John Ringo book - but hey - all of his other books were great ! In Ghost along with all of the sick sexual predator stuff John gave up his literary soul to start preaching the hard right neo-con litany.In Princess of Wands he starts off with a great character and then ruins it by getting into religious proselytizing - if I wanted to be preached to about God I would listen to Pat Robertson (shudder)or go to a sane church.Mr. Ringo needs to stick to his strengths ( ass kicking action and rationale likable characters.READER TO John Ringo - I buy books to be entertained not to be propgandized to on my own nickel - I'm afraid I have to cross you off my buy as soon as they come out authors. A shame you HAD some real talent.Tim from Atlanta
3,Omen meets Lives of the Saints,"This is a good story - excellent in its first segment, and not as good, but still interesting in its later stages. A Christian wife and mother finds herself caught up in a fight against a diabolic manifestation. She triumphs, and becomes part of an ""inter-faith"" team fighting the forces of supernatural evil in the world. Not as preachy (John Ringo's recent books have been pushing the political line of right-wing republican views fairly strongly) and entertaining, but John has done better. Hopefully there will be a sequel which will be better."
3,Killin' demons and author cameos,"This one is a bit different from Ringo's usual military sci fi stuff. A housewife who kills demons in her spare time would usually be the domain of those godawful vampire romance books, but Ringo injects some action; some humor; and some parodies of some familiar authors to liven things up. I recommend this book. Read it."
3,"Okay, for a Ringo book","This wasn't a bad book. But it was not up there with John's others. I have read all of his books except Ghost and have enjoyed them all. My Favorite is Road to Damascus, but this was not up there. The first story was great, lot of action, interesting story. The second story was a bit long and kind of dragged. The third was too quick. If you are a die hard Ringo fan you will like this book, but for others, read some of his Posleen series or the Empire of Man series or Through the Looking Glass. You would be disappointed in this one.Sorry John"
3,Barbara Eden meets demons,"As I have read most of the other reviews, i decided to add my own 2 cents..YOu all missed the parallell to Barbara Eden, Tall lovely and well built..(Yes i had a crush on her in my early years!)and noone exept 2 mortals knowing what she could do(magically).I can find no ther books in this series..Please help me find them."
1,Disappointing,"This book lacks a plot; it is written like a overly simplistic comic book with an all powerful heroine who doesn't seem to have to struggle to wipe out evil (except perhaps her inclination to obey her nonentity of a husband).Her enemies unfortunatey are totally one-dimensional and so is sheThere are 3 stories in here rather than something with that has the characterization and complexity or good fiction especially a novel which I was expecting. The first story ended when I thought there must be more. Very unsatisfyingIt is full of violence, torture and meaningless death. And the religious elements are a mishmash. No religion would accept them as represesenting their ideas.There is a lot of muh better fantasy out there. If you want heroines with depth see Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover series."
2,Not up to Ringo's usual standards,"This only got 2 stars instead of 1 because the first section (novella? episode?) was actually halfway entertaining. The rest of the book (and the first 20-30 pages of the second book that I made it thru before tossing it) was putrid. Not just bad. Not just trite and predictable. Putrid.Planning more books in the series, Mr. Ringo? Just say no. Your potential readers and your reputation will thank you for it."
3,GRA,"This book shows the CASE technologies and tools that are applied to software projects. It is very useful to softwareproject managers and developer. It helps people to apply CASE. Currently, Even if study in the field is not active, CASE tool has been produced by a lot of softwarevendors applying cahnging technologies. This book can be used to predict thos chanes in CASE technologies and tools."
3,"Worked for a while, but...","It worked real well, but the door broke before a year was up. The plastic that formed the hinge cracked off."
5,Works great,"performs as indicated and installation was pretty straightforward. I did end up removing the door so it was easier to cut opening, drill bolt holes and fasten - removing and reinstalling the door was the hardest part. I will definitely purchase another one."
4,Nice Product - Good For 2 Years Use by 3 Cats,This is the 3rd one of these I have bought and the first time buying one on here since I became a huge fan of Amazon. They are easy to install once a hole is cut and work with no issues for about 2 years before the plastic door breaks or in my case shatters. But then again getting it for about $22 bucks is $11 dollars a year of piece of mind and no litter boxes which make it well worth it. If it lasted longer it would get 5 stars. They should really look at using a flexible rubber type door like I have for the larger dog one I use. But again that one cost several times more money.
2,Difficult to cut the plastic insert,"You're supposed to cut the plastic insert along the indentions with an Exacto knife. I'm having a heck of a time with it. I must not be strong enough. I'm middle aged and I weight train so I'm surprised I'm the only one that's had trouble with this. Is there a better way to cut it? As it is, I'm not going to be able to use the door because it's just way too much work to get it to the right size."
3,Not bad overall,"Overall, a nice product. But the close/open buttons are very flimsy and difficult to operate. I am pretty sure they will break off after a short period. Otherwise, the door was easy to install and looks nice."
4,Eager Earner,"I bought this book after borrowing it from someone else.Doing the work, as Barbara refers to it can be rather painful.That said after reading this and utilizing some of the helpfultechniques in this book my income has actually risen as hasmy opinion of how much I deserve to earn."
5,Must Reading,"I was introduced to this book yesterday and immediately had to buy a copy for myself to share with my friends and family.So many Americans have their heads in the sand during this administration and think these are the ""moral"" ones. Look again. We have all been deceived and it is becoming more apparent with each passing day.If left unchecked, we will have the ultra-rich and the very poor and nobody in the Middle Class.Great conversation starter."
1,SICKENING!,"This thing looks like it was ghost-written by any of a number of leftist losers -- Al Franken, Michael Moore, take your pick -- whose asinine beliefs were dumped by the roadside where they belonged when the Bush administration finally took the White House away from the nightmarish fiasco of the Clintons. I like the Bizarro comic well enough, but if these are Piraro's true political beliefs, then he should be ashamed of himself."
5,GREAT!,"I Love It! This books should be required reading for everyone. The PERFECT history of GWB. Perhaps the ""compassionate conservatives"" should take this on their next month long vacations. Maybe they'll learn something while living off of everyone elses money in their brick houses!!"
3,NOT genuine APC,"This is NOT a genuine APC battery. It appears to be a locally-assembled knockoff. Only time will tell whether it is of decent quality. The wiring harness is adequate and the unit is assembled properly. I considered returning it, but will give it a shot.The vendor should be required to list the actual component manufacturer in the specifications (it currently lists all the genuine APC specs, including the 3-5 year life expectancy), and replace the misleading APC battery image with one of their own."
5,Good battery,The replacement UPS battery works as advertised. The battery was easily installed into the existing UPS. The battery looks just like the original battery from APC. Thank you.
2,Be careful,"If you are looking for an APC branded replacement battery, be careful which seller you buy from. At least one seller is actually selling their own brand instead of the APC brand. It may be of equal or better quality, but it has a shorter warranty period and does not provide any of the other benefits of getting the APC branded battery."
2,NOT RECOMMEND,It has been a month and I have not received a replacement yet. the item was defective and I'm still waiting for a replacement.
3,"works, wish price was cheaper",Battery works but wished the price was cheaper. same battery as what was in my unit so I bought this.
4,accurate and first-hand,"Leo, a Canadian from Alberta, travelled to Yellowknife to get the true story. This book was well researched with Leo interviewing most, if not all, of the search and decontamination team, Arctic explorers, etc. This book is a treasure trove of information about those long ago events of 1978."
5,billy ray cyrus - complete video collection (VHS),I loved every song on this dvd Its my favourite billy ray cyrus has a remarkable voice and all the film clips are fantastic
3,A Potpourri of SM pleasures,"If you're curious about S&M this might be a good book to start with, it covers a myriad of topics from piercing to spanking, but doesn't really focus on any in particular. Enjoyable at times, but not for the experienced."
2,Lousy range. Too few buttons.,"I have been using this remote since Christmas 2008. I purchased it for my mother who needs ""large number buttons"".The remote works as advertised, albeit with very few options and not enough buttons to truly represent any original device's remote you are replacing.My biggest gripe is that when we try to change channels on our cable box, turn up/down the volume, mute, etc., it often takes several tries to get the thing to do anything. You have to pretty much aim right at the cable box to make anything happen. We also use a Phillips 8-function learning remote which works no matter what angle you point it at in the room."
1,Does not work for my television which was made in 1989,"I gave one star since I can't determine if it works. My television set was manufactured in 1989. So this could be the reason. Be aware that the manufacturer could be listed in the booklet that is enclosed, yet it gives no information regarding age of your television set. Also it is difficult to insert the batteries, the design is a really tight fit. So good luck"
2,NOT worth reading,In the begining of this book its was adventursum and kept you on the edge of your seat but I started to get board around the middle and had to put it down. The story line of this story was interesting and exciting in a mysterious sort of way but really isnt worth reading. If I were you I would skip the reading of this book
3,Mixed feelings,Content covered in the video is good however video quality is very poor. The video appears to be shot in the 1970's to early 1980's and reminiscent of old home movie footage.
5,Great Read Start to Finish,"If you're looking for a mystery that's far from the ordinary, then you're looking for ""Second Advent"". From the protagonist -a star investigative reporter who's turned stay-at-home dad to save his marriage (and trying to repress his newshound nose)- to the murder in his hometown that brings him out of semi-retirement whether he likes it or not, everything in this read takes you where you don't expect to go.This is pure fun that'll keep you guessing. If you go to the author's website you'll learn he's making this a series, so we've got that much more to look forward to."
3,similar!,"For all of you out there who want to know who this truly sounds like, it is sam roberts. sam roberts is also a canadian boy (but from québec), and his sound is slightly more varying i think. they both have a smooth, relaxed sound, but i know they've got rocker edge too! if you liked this one, or liked a couple songs on it, but found it iffy, go for sam roberts, as it is more solid."
3,Canada's Version of Rooney,"They sound like Sloan, or should I say borrowed Chris Murphy's voice from Sloan. And they have the same style as Rooney; indie pop. I give it a minor thumbs up!"
5,Excellent introduction,"My husband and I had a ""massage your mate"" teaching session while on vacation a few years ago, and he loved it. Unfortunately, it was too easy to forget all the techniques we learned over time. This video is an excellent tool to help us remember what we learned and to pick up new skills. It's very tastefully done (if you can ignore the '80s hair and clothes!), well narrated, and very accessible. Highly recommended."
2,It was lude and disgusting. I found it to be innappropriate,This was terrible. I hardly call a movie about touching and rubbing tasteful. This was the worst massage video I have ever seen. You should discontinue it from your listings
1,surfbook,no text to explain why these pictures are surf related. hardly any actual surfing pics at all.
5,Great Surf Book & Intimate Photography,"I have to say that I was initially disappointed that the book did not have as much actual surfing pictures in it. But after looking through it thoroughly, the book's photography and stories give you a view of many people that most of us would never get to know, especially those who do not surf. Luckily, the book is not a self-promoting book Joel Tudor (the author). Although I am a fan of Joel's surfing style, this book is about people and their personalities captured through images and stories."
2,For Muzac lovers Only,"This video is purely for massage music lovers and is just an advocation for the Esalen massage method. It's a video for tourist to visit the spa at best! They give you advice, but, it's divided between more than one individual and body parts are scattered. The main point is- it isn't as instructional as it is peaceful scenery/music, whilst observing others be massaged. I guess it's perfect then for the ""massage voyeur"" and ""foot-fetishist"" but not for those seeking to learn good massage techniques."
1,Red Skelton King of Laughter,Very unsatisfactory video dealing with Red Skelton...a hodgepodge of clips...poor quality and fuzzy...quite a disappointment for a Red Skelton fan!
3,An enjoyable novel based in the '80s in Russia.,"A friend of mine gave me this book and told me that if I enjoyed Gorky Park (by Cruz Smith) then I would also like this one.She was right - this is a pretty fast moving detective novel, set in the `80s when the Cold War was still making news. It involves a KGB Captain investigating a murder - if you enjoy Kremlin politics, you will like this one."
5,Wilderness Family part 2,This is one of the best family movies out there. It will touch your heart forever.
5,Great product,"Was looking for a case and stand for my zune since the crazy little grey bag that was included with the zune is an awful case. This one is great; quality construction, stylish, and not too pricey. It's not too bulky, I'm able to get at every control and it even has a plastic cover over the screen to protect against scratches.The only thing that I can think of to add would be some sort of belt clip or loop, but I don't use my zune for music so that really that wouldn't make much difference to me."
3,Follow Up. Great Value so Far,"Okay,I've been using this computer for about three months. Limitations have come up. The chip is fast, but the machine is slow. It hangs with multiple applications open. When playing MP3s if you try to do anything (even as simple as ""alt-tab"") the MP3 glitches. The speaker volume is low, and even with headphones the volume is low. Using the headphones I couldn't hear a movie I was playing on a plane. The key board is awful. Even after playing with the repeat setting a bunch I still can't type as fast as I want.But, it is still inexpensive and has a big screen. And bottom line is I can still use it for graphics work no problem.So that's the skinny.It can be slow and annoying, but at this price who's complaining?"
3,Pros with Cons to Consider,"I purchased the ze5385us over the summer to be used during the fall at Georgia Tech. Overall, it's a satisfactory machine. The vertical scroller coupled with the customizable one touch buttons allow for increased efficiency. However, The biggest flaw is the blower fans used to cool this product. THAT'S RIGHT! BLOWER FANS NOT REGULAR FANS. You can not sit in class with the damn fan on without agitating class mates and the professor. For all the power goodies HP put into this product, they did not consider the issue of quiet performance. I feel this to be a big deal in many situations. Along with this, playing MP3's glitch when Alt-tabing. Hopefully HP will rectify this issue through a patch. If performance over quiteness is your aim, this machine shall not disappoint you."
4,Good machine for a great price,"I've used the machine both at home and at work for about three weeks now. I bought this machine because I needed a workhorse instead of a thoroughbred - I needed an inexpensive portable desktop I could use for everything from games and development to writing and graphic design.The machine appears designed to appeal to a younger adult crowd; lots of lights in ""cool"" colors, blue/silver layout, larger footprint. It's heavy (about 7.5 lb); if you want a lightweight machine, look elsewhere. However, it's fast, it'll run about 2 hours on a full charge, and it's got just about every feature supported by a comparable desktop at the same price.In short, it's a good machine at a great price."
3,good for the money,"This little clock is good for the money, but I didn't like the fact that I couldn't see the time during the night without having to fumble around to press the button."
3,Good solid value -- one major ergonmic flaw,"It's a solid buy at eight bucks.My only irritation is the alarm ""on off"" button is clustered on a multi-purpose slider switch.The alarm ""on off"" deserves its own, big button, since its a feature you use every night and every morning. Indeed, this is how most alarm clocks do it -- a big dedicate ""on off"" that you can visually confirm is set correctly.Why bury them most common task on a multi function button? It's easy to mis-set when you're groggy and that can be a real bummer if that makes you miss an early morning meeting."
5,Sharp LCD Blue Backlight Alarm Clock - Titanium,"This one neat alarm clock. It's easy to use, has an unbelievable alarm that would wake up a sleeping giant, easy to use light/snooze button, runs on two AA cells and fits easily into travel bag. And it's inexpensive, too.Sharp SPC317A LCD Blue Backlight Alarm Clock with Titanium Case (Black)"
1,garbage,"The sole reason to purchase this clock, the alarm, did not work on mine when it arrived.. you can set an alarm, but it makes NO noise when the time comes. complete waste of 7 bucks."
1,"If an alarm does not work, does anyone hear it?","The whole point of an alarm is to make an alarm sound consistently.This product sometimes does not make a sound at the set alarm time.Thus, useless."
1,used and dead on arrival,Item arrived used and not working (dead on arrival).I would have returned it but i live out of the US so shipping the item back for a refund would not be economical.
4,This Is All You Really Need,"Ramsey Lewis's career has spanned more than four decades, but the bulk of the tracks collected here are from the mid-Sixties when his pop-jazz piano stylings earned him four Top 40 hits and a Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental, and they're all here: ""The 'In' Crowd,"" ""Hang on Sloopy,"" ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Wade in the Water."" the other eight instrumentals follow in a similar mode. 1973's Greatest Hits on MCA is a better bargain if you can still find it, but in the meantime this is the one Ramsey Lewis album to own. RECOMMENDED"
3,Comprehensive but a lot of reading,"This book and DVDs can be helpful to an international student preparing to enter a university in the United States- it comprehensively covers a variety of cultural aspects of speaking and listening in the U.S. There's a lot of reading, though, so some may not like that aspect of it."
2,No DVDs included!,"They didn't include DVDs in the pack though it says ""new"". Be sure to check it before you buy. Check the product details!"
1,I did NOT receive the DVD with the book.,"The one I bought is marked with ""NEW"", with which relevant DVDs are not included. How am I suppose to do those listening tasks WITHOUT LISTENING to it??????????????"
3,More of a novelty book,"This book was more of a novelty book than I thought it would be. Some of the meditations were a bit odd. For the right price I'd say go for it though because it is nice to sit down once a week and connect with your baby. Each week has several different meditations and poems so even if you don't like one, you'll probably like the others :)"
2,How does cd come when you download digital book?,I have downloaded this book onto my kindle app for iPad but am not sure how I get the music? Can anyone assist?
2,Thought it was a CD.,It's OK. I was just disappointed because I thought it was weekly guided meditations on CD. Turns out it is a book of meditations and a CD comes with the book with one guided meditation on it.
5,Multipurpose designs,"While I have heard complaints that this book is in black and white, I find that to be an advantage. I find colored charts are sometimes distracting, especially if you are trying to use the charted design for something like filet crochet. I love the variety of the designs and how one design leads to the evolution of another. Highly recommend this book for any type of celtic design work!!"
2,Mixed Review Again for Dover Needleworks,"I have purchased both Celtic design books from Dover. Good designs, but the lack of color in the designs and the hard to read black and white charts are a hindrance. The one thing they really have going for them is that it's just hard to find other designs like these in color. So for the price, you can always enlarge these charts and play around with the color on your own."
1,Broken after 1 month,"Do not buy this DVD player!!! I bought this one based on the high review it got from Consumer Reports. The RCA DRC285 worked fine for about a month (daily use), and then suddenly started freezing up. The picture would be frozen in a garbled image, and then the machine would be completely unresponsive, and I had to unplug it / replug it in to get it to work again. Near the end it would freeze up after 5 minutes on any disc. The RCA was a great deal for a 1080p unconverting player ($50), and I definitely got what I paid for. Returned it and went with the Sony DVP-NS77H, which I haven't had any problems with."
1,Cheap and defective,"The product feels very cheap, as does the remote. It worked for about a week and then simply died. I sent it back. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,TERRIBLE,"I hooked the player up and in 5 min it died. The picture started scrambling and then it never showed anything on the screen after that. I have to return it now and speaking with ""ritzcamera"" customer support is almost to hard to even get my refund. Absolutly brutal experience. Its only $50 so I am thinking I am just going to give up. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."
2,Mine Lasted 13 months,"Actually, it is still working, but it is failing in the middle of videos, and has to be rebooted. It was cheap, but I have bought other cheap players that were no name that actually still work after years. I just need the HDMI port.Lesson: READ the reviews before purchase!!"
1,Defective Product,"I have owned this equipment for 18 months and like most of the other reviews mine too failed in the same manner: freezing up, garbled picture. It worked great for about a year of light use, then became useless. I've had DVD players for years and never had one fail. So I can only conclude that there is a manufacturing defect (most likely a defective chip) so you think RCA would offer a repair solution. This really damages their reputation. I got the player for about $50 dollars at Sears so its more of an annoyance than big financial loss. Stay away from this product and save yourself time and money."
1,Got two of them - both failed,"Bought one of these, and two months later it failed. Brought it back to the store, and had it replaced. The second failed a couple of months later. This product is just no good."
1,"Steer clear - usb worked badly, died after 45 days","The usb did play mpeg videos copied from my pc, though not what I hoped for. Switch to usb mode takes about 45 seconds. Back to dvd is another 25 seconds. It plays jpgs but the lag is so bad that you'll just live with the slide show or not bother. When it finishes playing a mpeg it immediately starts playing the next - would be nice if this was an option, but you have no choice. To get out of the loop you have to switch out of usb mode and back again. Unit died on me after 45 days. Contacts RCA for support and never heard back, apart from the auto reply which said 3 days.RCA support is horrible, they don't even have a phone number. I'd steer clear of all their stuff for a while."
1,Good For Only 7 Months,"I wanted a DVD player that upconverted to HDMI; picked this one despite the negative reviews because it was cheap and a Consumer Reports Best Buy. It worked fine for 7 months; one quirk is that I couldn't get it to NOT strech 4:3 dvds so I ended up only viewing letterbox dvds on it.However about 7 months later it started freezing up on DVDs, and now it can't seem to play anything. What a piece of junk."
4,Gets the Job Done,I have video hooked up with component cables and have not tried HDMI yet. It produces good video and sound. I have had it for about a month and have had absolutely no problems. The menu and remote are anything but sophisticated. Overall it gets the job done and keeps the kids happy.
1,Terrible dvd player...don't waste your time,"Sure this player is inexpensive and is made by RCA (I guess a decent manufacturer???), but don't be fooled. This is a cheap piece of machinery. When I hooked the player up, I was able to play one movie. The picture was ok...definitely not great (even with the upscaling). After that movie though, no other dvds worked on the player. In fact, every film I tried to play ended up jamming the player and I had to unplug the system to release the disc. Thankfully, Amazon is refunding me my money. Don't waste your time with this player. Spend the extra $20 and go with another model."
1,Good while it lasted,An otherwise good DVD player but with very poor product quality. Looks and feels cheap. Died on me after watching just a few movies and right on the very first time I hooked it to my TV using the HDMI port. Returned it to the store for an exchange. The second unit died in the same way after watching a couple of movies as well. The first unit first showed black stripes across the screen and then after a while it froze and the screen was full of garbled image. Second unit died suddenly with the same garbled screen.It's a shame because the built-in USB port is really useful. You can view pictures and watch movies shot with a digital camera. You can also play music files from this port as well or convert an audio CD to MP3 files into any flash drive plugged in the USB port. This port was THE reason I originally chose this particular model over other upconverting models despite negative reviews I had read elsewhere.
1,"I agree, this is defective",I have one of these units and it worked fine for about 2 months and then it died. It had a great picture while it lasted but I would not recommend it to anyone. Buy a different brand if you want something that will last!
1,Warranty is a joke. Broke after 6 months,"I purchased this from Amazon 6 months ago. It broke last week. Since it is suppose to be under warranty I called RCA. They wanted to charge me a $50 service fee to have the DVD player switched out, which is almost the full price of the unit. Basically you really only have a warranty until 90 days, after that point you are forced to pay their ""fee"". They do not support their products whatsoever. I am now left with a very large paper weight. Save yourself the trouble and buy from a company that actually stands behind their products and offers a full warranty with no strings attached."
4,Hawkwind - 'Night Of The Hawks' (MVD) 4 1/2 stars,"Originally had this show on VHS, but of course it's great to have it now on DVD. 'Night...' was recorded in spring, 1984 at the Gaumont Theatre in Ipswich, UK. Picture and sound quality is pretty good. At least with a DVD, I won't have to concern myself with the color fading. I thought it was interesting how co-founder Nik Turner was allowed to return to Hawkwind, as I noticed that Dave Brock allows Turner to be the frontman and focal point through out the entire hour long concert here. Tunes I more than thoroughly 'soaked in' here were ""Ghost Dance"" ( a different version than most others), the futuristic ""Watching The Grass Grow"", ""Ejection"", my two favorites here ""Ejection"" and ""Uncle Sams on Mars"" as well as ""Sonic Attack"" ""Psi Power"" (where Brock steps out to provide the lead vocals) and the stunning encore of ""Silver Machine"". Well done. Recommended."
1,A Little scary,"Ballroom and Latin dance has come a long way. Even though many of the dancers on the DVD are still at the top ranks of the pro circuit, this is NOT a great showcase. This is nice to watch in order to compare to the styles and skill of today, but not the kind of video you will watch over and over. The only truly spectacular dancing is that of Marcus and Karen Hilton (standard only). They were then, and are now quite amazing. For those of us in Canada, Alain Doucet and Anik Jolicouer are on this tape, briefly, in the Standard final."
4,International Championships,"Even though this is from the early 90's, it's fun to watch and see how far ballroom has come. There's great dancing. I bought this mostly to watch Donnie Burns and Gaynor Fairweather. Donnie's son is Benji Schwimmer, who won America's Favorite Dancer 2006 on So You Think You Can Dance. Donnie Burn's is a phenomenal latin dancer, and one can see where Benji inherited his gift. For the price, this dvd is worth watching and adding to their collection for anyone who loves Ballroom."
5,Still very good at this price,Old? Not quite. Several competitors in the competition are still among world's top ranked professionals. And how many dance better than Burns and Fairweather even today?
4,Lee Powder Measure,"Simple to set up; simple to use. I mounted it (using the enclosed mount) on a piece of scrap oak 1x4 to make it portable on my work bench. The measure tool takes a while to get calibrated - using the supplied formula table and following Lee's directions, I still ended up making adjustments outside the prescribed settings and then weighing out each powder throw until getting the desired weight. Once locked in, repeatability seems to be quite good - within the 0.1 grain advertised. When reloading, I measure multiple powder throws at the start, and then after every ten loads. I have not had any problematic variations - all within 0.1 grain of setting. For a ""two-boxes at a time"" pistol reloader like me, this is a very good, very affordable powder measure."
1,Buyer Beware....,"There are so many reasons to ""Beware"" if you are thinking about buying this backing pad. My first warning is to not buy this at all. It is cheap and did not last even 10 minutes. It is too thin and too rigid, so the edges ware away instantly. The next warning is if you do buy it, definitely follow the instructions stamped directly on it... ""Wear eye, face and body protection."" You will need the protection because of all the pieces of plastic flying off the disk as it comes apart."
2,Lightweight backing pad,"When I received the backing pad, it was immediately apparent that this was a lightweight pad (didn't want to call it cheap). My OEM Makita was much heavier and made of hard rubber and not thin plastic. Time will only tell on this product."
4,Canadian Humour,"Bought this for the ""Hockey song"" which is classic Canadian ""hockey night in Canada"" nostalgia. I grew up listening to Foster Hewitt doing the saturday night broadcasts from the gondola high above Maple Leaf Gardens. Rest of the CD was more fun that I had anticipated."
1,Mini-Megalomaniac,"Only a fool would vote for someone who couldn't even keep the city of Cleveland solvent. Lots of heat but not much light. Obviously, this book was released to coincide with an anemic Presidential campaign. YACET (Yet Another Congressman's Ego Trip)."
5,He speaks to the mind and the heart...,"Not since Robert Kennedy wrote ""To Seek a Newer World"" when he ran for President while Senator from NY, during an unpopular war and an economy that split a nation into haves and have-nots, has a voice spoken so clearly to those of us not blinded by our own self-interests. We need to stop letting the media direct our thinking about who is the front runner, who is worth listening to, etc., and read for ourselves. Kucinich has refreshingly new ideas that speak to both the mind and the heart."
2,Weak,"The production of this DVD is weak. It could be much better. It's a dull documentary of Iceland nature. It has no modern overview, since it seems to be a pre-historic footage of the land. It's sooooo boring, I coulnd't even get to the end."
1,Don't waste your money,"This didn't do anything. I was expecting something, anything, but this did nothing at all. Do yourself a favor and save your money."
5,Greatest Love Songs by Will Downing,This CD is great. I just love Will. The duets are wonderful. Nothing but love for this CD.
4,The Luther Vandross nobody knows,Will Downing has been doing His thing for many years but can't seem to get any Respect.I have enjoyed his Duet material.this is a Cool Set.a good solid Overview into What Makes Will Downing a Solid Vocalist but very Underrated.
3,Will Downing,He has such a nice voice but its lost in this CD because most the songs are borrowed songs perfomed by other artist
3,w8 4 battle arena or other things,"ok over all i think that thse little things are really cool.... if you buy them for children let me tell you that they will not play game. they will probly just use the wepions on the non moving characters to kill each other (sounds fun to me! ^_^) *sigh* i remember the good old days when digimon was cool.... everyone brought the little figure people to school good times good times.... but anyways i would say dont buy this thing to start with, get a battle arena or that fist thingy bcuz they come with multiple people and the entire game itself (as well as a stylish carying case) if you want to buy this one i only reccomend u buy it as a booster pack. all in all just spend an extra 2 dollers for a starter pack then go for this when u get more money. happy buying (good luck >_^)"
1,SQUEAKY SHOES!,"They are cute, stylish and fit great. However, they are the squeakiest shoes that I ever owned. They are so squeaky that I can't wear them to the office. I bent and stretched them, but the squeak is somewhere on the inside. Beware of buying shoes on the internet!"
3,good for small churches,"I found this book a good basic intro. It should work well for those without an electronics background. For formulas and numbers, and more technical information see the Guide to Sound Systems for Worship by Jon F. Eiche."
4,Good for the basics.,This a good book for people who need the basics. I found it very helpful. I would have liked more indepth technical information.
4,Sound for Non geeks!,"I found this book to be exactly what I was looking for. I did not have the expetise in sound systems, when my Church ask me to disign a sound system for them, I was in the dark. Even though I have a BSEE this was not my field of expertise. I needed a book for the basic of what to acheive in a sound system. This was it. Thank you"
3,Works well for hobby compressor without air tank,"Filter and moisture trap works well in any condition. My only complaint is the air pressure regulator - it works by allowing certain amount of air through and leaking out the rest. This works well for hobby compressors, but when you have a compressor with air tank you will find that it will quickly leak all the air out of the tank during the paint spray session. I tried this on my 10 gal portable air tank and industry 30 gal air compressor and it was unable to regulate air at any PSI (it will either give me the max or 15 PSI) However when I mounted it on a hobby compressor without an air tank (which has constant air delivery at 40 PSI) it worked well."
3,evaluation of book purchase,"I was disappointed at the condition of the book purchased. I did not believe it to be in the same condition as described. It was sent, carefully packaged, tho, which I appreciated."
3,A History of Peru,"The dvd was alright if you are really interested in church history in Peru. I was looking for a dvd with more information about the land and the people from a more cultural perspective(hearing them speak ,ect.) I wasn't interested in seeing the inside of all the churches..., and hearing about the schools, and government,ect. It gets better at the end, showing how some of the native people live. For the price, overall, its worth taking a look at."
3,Great for beginning bowler and teenagers,"There is some really good information in this book for beginning bowlers; however I recommend it for teenagers wanting to get into the sport. The author and photographer did a good job of putting a lot of photos in the book to demonstrate their points. I would give this book to a kid or teen wanting to get into the sport. If you are an adult wanting to try the sport or looking for fundamental advice then buys Bowling Fundamentals, you'll be happy you did."
2,Intelligence of Dogs,"The press on this book indicated it was written with charm and wit. Unfortunately it did not live up to that notice. The author is pedantic and takes himself and his subject much too seriously,"
3,"Philosphically right, psycholgically lacking","Dr. Coren presents a lot of valid arguments to promote his ideology of a conscious and intelligent dog. Although I have no qualms about his arguments about their intelligence, Coren tends to throw around some psychology and neuroscience terms with just his PhD next to his name to support it. We know little of the conscious phenomena in humans, let alone dogs, and without a concrete definition of consciousness to present date, to extrapolate what little is known on to dogs are far fetched. His arguments to support a conscious dog in fact many times over, define non-conscious behaviour, something that is of routine. Apart from that and a couple other things, it is still a good book."
2,Just say it already!,"Although Mr.Coren may know a lot about the history of dogs, how they are represented in different cultures, about different movements concerning animal intelligence, and the like, I couldn't help but feel that this guy just likes to hear himself ramble on and on and on! I may have a problem with run on sentences, but this Stanley needs an editor! You can skim through most of it, but the meat is hard to find, and I was quite bored. This is less of a scientific examination of a species and their intelligence, and more of a round about study of a dogs history, and someone's inconclusive opinion of how and what they might be thinking.Oh well."
1,Disapointment,"If you go to all the inteigent dog lists it's the same order. BC first, poodles next,.... So all this info is taken only from one scource! Now i have a lab and a aussie, lab is ranked #7, aussies sadly #42! Now my aussie is smarter than my lab. i give both my dogs iq test toys and my aussie always solves them in lighting speed. My lab takes a while to slove it. Also in daily life my lab walks around the house being stupid but the aussie is acting all smart all day long. Go to a obeince trail and see what dogs are there, BC, aussie, dobes, goldens, labs, beligins."
5,Must read for anyone with a love of dogs!,"Entertaining, practical, and enlightening; this one-of-a-kind work blends a delightful mixture of witty first-hand observations on the nature of dogs, and a refreshing historical perspective on the origins of canine behavior and cognition. Mr. Coren has a talent for story telling and an obvious respect and understanding of man's most dedicated companion and working partner: the domestic dog. A ""must read"" for any dog enthusiast as well as for all animal professionals."
3,Disappointing,"The description of the book would suggest that there is quite a bit of discussion regarding how to rank your own pet, or practical applications or thoughts about dealing with a gifted or less than gifted dog. However, the focal point of the book was whether or not dog intelligence could actually be classified as intelligence. Unfortunately, I did not purchase the book to decipher the nature of intelligence itself, but to apply the theories of intelligence on my own prodigy pooch. I was under the impression that this book would teach me how to better deal with my excessively intelligent dog. I was disappointed. I did however, find the book helpful in the case of the tests Mr. Coran included."
1,Meh,Bought this book to better understand how the intelligence ranking was created. It's stuffed full of naturalism presented as fact as apposed to theory. I could have skipped past it and gotten to the good bits but was so put off I didn't make it far through the book.
5,Smart Dogs,"Stanley Coran has some very interesting and infomative things to say about dogs, I know I learned something even after training dogs for many years! I would recommend this book for any dog lover."
3,Ok shoe,"The overall construction and quality of the shoe is descent.The sole is thick and it is easy for kids to slip on and off but after the first time of my daughter wearing them the gems started falling off.They look nice,my daughter likes them anyway,the outside of the shoe has a wrinkly or crinkled look.I think they are worth the sale price but full price no way.I would be very upset to spend over $50 on a pair of shoes and have the gems start falling off the first day."
2,Not so helpful for the college student,Not bad but really more geared for high school students planning on and in the progress of applying and planning for college. Some sparse info for he college student.
2,NOT for beginners,The easiest level is WAY too hard for beginners. I have little knowledge of french and rather than single word recognition or grammer it's asking me to respond to questions. This instant immersion is like being thrown in the deep end. Also voice recognition is a little mediocre. Still after I get better elsewhere it may be pretty good.
3,Supernatural,"This is the first 3 Investigator's book in which there is actually some kind of ""X-files"" phenomena, I found the story a little confusing at times, but it has some interesting aspects, for example i didn't know what it's a mandala."
4,Great for the price!,"I bought this because it's a great value for the money. I paid $99 plus another $30 for shipping. The shipping cost really didn't upset me because looking at bike racks on other sites and vendors were well over $200. My only complaint about it is that there did appear to be a little rust on it, but some Rust-oleum should take care of it. $130 plus the cost of the Rust-Oleum is still cheaper than other similar products....not to mention this features a cargo carrier in addition to the bike rack."
1,SHIPPING COSTS A FORTUNE,"I can't comment on the quality of this item, because I am returning it unopened. However, I can comment on the deceptive ""super saver"" free shipping notice in the ad. NOTE: THIS ITEM DOES NOT GET FREE SHIPPING. You have to pay a ""minimum"" of $30 for shipping and handling for this item. Also, you don't know that until you actually ordered the item."
5,"Soul, Funk, Action and a 'Fro to round it up!",the movie is GREAT! I always enjoy a movie that is just plainly and simply humorous! One of my favourite movies - definetly worthwile to watch - right up there with Austin Powers!But I have one question - in the scene after the part where Undercover Brother taps the glass and it breaks - he is transmitting some information back to the brotherhood from a mini-cd he pulls out of his boot - what is the song that plays while he's sending the data back??? - its a instrumental and it is soooooo soulful - i like it!!! - is it actually a proper song or was it composed by the music director exclusively for the movie??? - please if you know the answer - send an email to mrblob8808@hotmail.com thanks!!!
3,Classic Songs that don't really fit the Film,I Like Most of the Songs Featured here problem is like alot of Films over the past few years they put any Classic Hit on a Soundtrack&try to Make it Work because it was a Great Song as to it being a Part of the Film at hand.in other words it doesn't always fit.this is a Classic Case of that overall.Good Songs but they don't really connect to me with the Rest of the Film.
1,Missing something,"I was very sad to see that the N'Sync Song ""Here We Go"" was not on the soundtrack. It was in the movie and played a significant role, but I guess it was just not ""Black enough"" for the soundtrack."
4,Good,"There are some cool R&B and funk old school songs, but what's amusing is that the 'white' songs that appeared in the movie (*Nsync's ""Here We Go"" and Willa Ford's ""I Wanna Be Bad"") are absent, I suppose because they were only used in comical situations in the movie, and trying to be portrayed as bad music. Anyways. This is alright."
4,4 stars overall it was a fantastic read,I gave it 4 stars because it was fantastic but Bonnie Bryant has written better. I would recommend this book to all horse lovers and girls how love the power of friendship and don't just stop here you should definitely read the whole series!!! I LOVE THE SADDLE CLUB!!!!!!
5,Great Starter to the Series,"Horse Crazy is a great book! I own all three cover versions of the book. It starts out with Stevie complaining about the fact that her mother won't pay for the MTO trip and gets the idea to start a odd-job business. Then, Carole meets Lisa who is a new rider. Stevie and Carole are BFFs and Lisa doesn't like Stevie at first, but soon they are best friends and make the Saddle Club. Overall, it's a great book. I recommend it. Like most books, it has a few down points. There are more exciting Saddle Club books (101 books in all!) and some of the facts in the book are a little too outrageous like Veronica riding a stallion and Carole being able to ride it too. As a 12 year old, I don't see them being experienced enough. Still, GET THIS BOOK!I recommend other books in the series like Driving Team, Dude Ranch, Show Horse, Show Jumper ect, too. <^~"
3,"Good, but these are better","I liked this book, but the others are better. So are Horses By Email and Thoroughbred. Also, the Bonnie books. The problem I had with the first Saddle Club book was how dumb the kids are. This book talks down to kids instead of to us."
5,Great Book,"I thought this was a really great book. Stevie can't go on the camping trip unless she brings her grades up, and her friends have to help her out, that way they can all go on the trip together. It was a very entertaining book, but was pretty predictable."
5,YOU HAVE GOT TO READ THIS HORSE FANS!,"It's the start of a wonderful series of books. Yes it may start boring but it is the foundations of a really GREAT EXCELLENT SERIES. Read it if you love horses and the you could read any of the othe saddle club books, some sad, some fun, daring and dangerous, racing, western, showjumping, camps, runaways, fox hunts, and lots more. IT FILLS MY SHELF!"
5,The Beginning of the Saddle Club,"Carole and Stevie have been great friends for the longest time. When the new rider comes in, they don't get along with her at first, but then realize she is as horse crazy as them. That is how they created the Saddle Club."
3,OK,I knew what would happen through the entire book. The only thing this book states is how the saddle club formed in the first place.
5,Dinosaur Rug,This Rug is great - the colors are bright and the graphics draw the attention of my grandson he loves his Dinosaurland bedroom!
4,Classic John Holt,Read John Holt in conjunction with John Taylor Gatto if you really want to understand why the homeschool movement has snowballed over the last 20 years.
3,homeschooling,we ordered books to better understand home school and we needed to find out what the process was for homeschooling so we ordered some books that would help us do that
4,"Wonderful, just not what I was looking for.","I borrowed this book from my local library along with a number of other books, in order to better prepare myself to begin my new job as a teacher for toddlers. While the book covers a wide spread of ages, the focus on toddlers wasn't as extensive as I had hoped. Over all it is a great book, just not what I was looking for."
5,wonderful book,"Everyone should read this book, whether you have children yet or not! This is a great insight into how we as humans learn naturally and organically! A wonderful read."
5,Learning All the Time,"This book is a wonderful collection of observations from multiple sources, including John Holt. Reading this may help you to step out of your shoes and into the shoes of the child. Mr. Holts insights into how children think may help you to see how your own children come up with the things they do. Just because something doesn't make any sense to you doesn't mean it doesn't make sense to them. Just because that wasn't the answer sought doesn't mean it is wrong. Children are ""Learning All the Time"" take a moment step back and watch."
5,The book that started it all for us,"I read an article about 15 years ago in Parade magazine about the Colfax family and the homeschooled sons that they sent to Harvard. This got me interested in homeschooling any children I might have one day, but my fiance (now my husband) disagreed. So I began on long, slow process of picking up books at the library about homeschooling and leaving them in convenient spots such as the bathroom, for him to read. This book is the one that convinced my husband that homeschooling was a viable and intelligent choice for our family.Filled with marvelous insights about children and how they learn, their initial love of learning and their later dread of it, this book explains why children's love of learning must be cherished and treasured. It is a wonderful book, for homeschooler and institutional schooler alike."
5,"Beware, this may change your entire worldview",Once your read this book Holt's ideas will be so obvious and self-evident that you will feel stupid for not realizing them yourself. He truly loves children and has tremendous respect for them and their capacity as human beings.This book completely changed the way I think about children. It had a domino effect that had me reevaluating my entire worldview.
3,Good quality,"This is nice sweater but it's a bit 'unfitted' for my taste. It just kind of hangs on me when I wear it. I wish it would give the illusion of curves on my waist as other sweaters like this do. I love the cowl neck, though."
3,Nice but shrunk....,"This is a very cute sweater, very soft, but it shrunk quite a bit the first time it was washed."
1,Poor product,"I purchased one of these computers only six weeks ago. On the second time out I detected black spots on the screen, where there should have been pixels. Pressing the screen brought some of them back, but as the day progressed the marks became cracks in the LCD screen itself. I reported the matter to HP the next day and they agreed to collect the unit for warranty repair. Some 10 days later they called me up demanding $650 to replace the screen, saying they were not prepared to honor the warranty for a crack.The lid is totally too flimsy to take the stress of holding the closed unit and lifting it from a carry bag. There is a connector right where you grasp the case, and this can dig in and crack the screen. For a portable laptop the design is not fit for purpose.NB the electronics work great but without a screen are of little value!"
4,Works for me; few issues; HP support Top Notch,"A refurbished version was given to me as a gift. It works great for me. Only issues:1) Left touchpad button has become flaky. Maybe overuse on my part.2) 256MB was insufficient for watching DVD movies. I installed additional 256MB and playback was improved.BTW, HP Support is excellent. They have an Active Chat support utility that is available online that allows you to 'chat' in real time with support personnel."
3,Reid Uncorks the Genie,"In this almost painfully meticulous book, Reid argues that most of the time we, humans are running on 'auto-pilot', just going through the motions and not really thinking to our real potential. Going from common perception to right brain thinking, Reid presents a wide array of exercises that can prep the mind for more active thinking. Definitely worth your attention!"
5,"think, smile, digest","I first read this book in 1980. It was a gift from my best and wisest friend, the hardcover version which I still treasure to this day. I have since probably bought half a dozen copies of this for the distinct reason that I felt someone merited a copy as a gift. This book makes you stop and think about yourself, your life and your expectations. It does not criticize your path nor does it necessarily offer an alternative. It just makes you think....... in an easy, enjoyable manner. This book won't give you the ""secret"" to a fulfilling life of health, wealth or whatever else you seek, but it will make you think...... and every now and then you may actually catch yourself smiling as you do so. Recommended, highly - but more so, fondly remembered 20 years, university, failed and successful career prospects, failed and successful romantic prospects later. Yes so ever fondly remembered."
3,For Beginers,"Listen to it as an introductory album to the 70s rock, rather than as the Dogtown soundtrack. If you've always wondered what Jimi Hendrix's and Alice Cooper's music sounded like, this album would give you a very very basic, must-have idea of that musical era."
3,No Gut Feeling,The highlight of this CD is the pic of Shogo dislodging a tile on the back cover. I agree that a few tracks that featured in the movie are tragicly missing but that doesnt stop it from being a collectors item.
3,Almost there...,"You're right, Patrick...Gut Feeling's off and probably one or two more...sometimes it's just a matter of a record company's admin assistant not returning a request-for-clearance phone call; sometimes it's that that artist or agent wanted WAAAYY too much in use fees. I'm stoked for this CD but will probably ""build"" my own after the DVD of the film releases, adding other personal-recalled tunes from the era as this scene happened, 10 or 12 rings out from the ""inner circle"". The Devo close to the film was pivotal, 'cuz that's when everybody cut their hair and went from smoky seventies tunes to amphetamine new wave. Good mix here, though..."
5,The movie IS the soundtrack,"I love the music from the movie. It's all of the songs I loved as a kid. When I see the ""soundtrack"", it doesn't have the songs on there that I wanted in the first place. Like most reviewers of this CD, I will have to complete it myself.The Devo close, ""Gut Feeling"", was so important in portraying a change in an era from hard-rock in the '70's to new wave in the '80's. It was ALMOST THE most important part of the movie from a cultural point of view. Stacy Peralta's film is pure genius. I wish it never ended."
1,No Installation Code,I bought a Filemaker Pro 5.5 but when I received it there was no installation code. This is totally useless to me without the install code. HELP!!!
4,Sweet program. TONS of killer features...,"This is a sweet program, and it has TONS of features that make it absolutely easy to oragnize information and build systems to run a business.Unfortunately, it's not an enterprise application in some ways, and it lacks features like the ability to encrypt date internally, so despite it's easy web publishing capabilities, it's not the program to run your fortune 500 off of.The interface to the program is sweet, and you can do just about EVERYTHING with filemaker, including client server applications, and distributed data management.I would reccomend this program to my family, but I can't give it 4 stars because it tries to be all things to all people, and isn't."
4,Pas mal--- il vaut la peine de l'acheter!,"Ben, j'ai acheté ce CD seulement pour la dernière chanson--Les Maudits Franais, une chansons géniale et trop juste. Lemay a un oeil pour les parculiarités culturelles franaises. J'ai trouvé les autres bien intéressantes, bien écrites--et elle a une jolie voix claire (et quel accent, d'ailleurs, j'adore!). Je donne 4 étoiles car le CD était en général bien mais pas ""brillant"".I bought this CD only for the last song, ""the accursed French,"" a terrific song that is all too true. Lemay truly has an eye for the cultural ticks found in France. The other songs are also interesting and well written--Lemay has a clear and beautiful voice--and what an accent! Gotta love it. I give the CD 4 start in lieu of 5 because it was good, but not dazzling."
1,i don't get it,"these guys have a lot of energy when playing live. they look like they're having so much fun that if you couldn't hear them, their enthusiasm would be contagious. and i really respect that, but they sound terrible. their singer especially. they have so much buzz that i've listened to their album and have seen them live half a dozen times or so. and sorry, but they're just awful. i think that their 'popularity' is based on the sheep that will like anything that has 'buzz.'"
4,A Fine Fantasy,"As a reader unused to the fantasy genre, I was not sure what to expect from Till Noever's Keaen. However, I found the characters and situations accessible and engrossing immediately. I look forward to hearing more stories from the world of Keaen, so fully and richly described in the novel."
4,Heart Shaped Ring,"This is a beautiful ring that I will wear for formal ocassions and feel well dressed. It is not too large but shines as if it cost much more than it did. It is sterling silver with cubic zirconia stones, so if misplaced it can be replaced at little cost."
4,Beautiful Ring,"I love this ring. An 8 was a tad too big, but the 7 would have been too small, so I'm satisfyed. Worth the price."
5,Love it!,"I read the reviews before buying this ring, and I was somewhat worried because there were negative things said about it. I think the ring is perfect. It looks just like the picture. I wear the ring almost every day, and get so many compliments on it. Definitely a great buy for the price!"
3,Slight flaw,"I got this ring last night. It is a pretty ring, however, the heart is slightly crooked on the band. It was only $16 so I don't feel like going through the hassle of getting something to ship it back in, or paying to do so. I will keep it and wear it because I do really like it, it is just a little weird looking on my finger. Probably not something most people would notice if not studying it.Also, I wish there would have been half sizes, it fits on my finger but is loose, and the size down would be too small.Shipping time was as stated."
5,LOVE!!,"I bought this ring in December 2011, it still shines and looks great! Buy it, you'll love it too! A few people have even thought it was real :)update 5/29/12This ring is still in excellent condition!! It has not faded or tarnished. I love it!!"
4,Smaller than what I was expecting,The ring looks small when you put it on but it feels comfortable. It's not too small that it's not noticeable anymore. It's classy and sparkles really nice.
5,Beautiful,Beautiful ring good quality great price. recieved compliment first day I wore it.. Nice thick band and pretty setting love it
5,Great Deal...Awesomely Happy,"I presented this ring to my wife, and she was really happy with it. Got a compliment on the very first day at a restaurant. She says that the ring looks sparkly giving it a diamond like look!! It is a simple but elegant ring. Highly recommended. Unless the girl is super picky, she is bound to love this ring."
4,"Nice, overall","The ring is nice, and even nicer for the price. However, I don't think it looks as nice in person as it does on the photo. I bought this ring as a gift for my mother and I'm sure that she will love it, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting based on the other reviews."
2,she didn't like it,"I bought this for a friend and she didn't like it. If I hadn't thrown away the receipt, I would return the item. However, in the past, I have always been pleased with any purchase."
2,Buyer beware,So disappointed! The photographs are a bit misleading. The band is thinner and the heart smaller. And worst of all the ring isn't as resilient in person. It looks tacky and dinky and I will return ASAP!!
3,Ehh...,"I ordered this ring based on all the wonderful reviews. I was disappointed when I saw it in person. Firstly, the ring looks dullish, and not sparkly and 'real' as some others said. Secondly, being a fair-skinned person, the ring looks washed out on my finger. (It makes my hand look pale.) Perhaps this ring is good for a young person -such as a person in their teens (maybe for a teen boyfriend to give to a teen girlfriend etc.) However, for someone more sophisticated, this ring just doesn't cut it. I would also not recommend this ring for a fair skinned person. It may look better on someone with darker skin."
3,Silver Cubic Heart Ring,After reading the other reveiws on this item I decided to purchase this ring. It is a very nice ring but the band is very small and thin. I have had it for two weeks and so far I am happy with it.
4,Nice casual piece,"Perfect for everyday wear. Not too flashy, but enough sparkle to be noticed. Might buy again for a gift. Doesn't discolor but its not so easy to clean because of the hollow inside."
4,Great ring for the $,"This ring is really nice! Not to big, not to small. It has a nice sparkle and looks good on the hand. You really can't beat it for the price. It is sterling silver, with the 925 stamp. Got it a few days before Valentine's Day, so far so good. The stones sparkle and are set into the heart. I think it's a wonderful buy!"
5,Stunning!,This was a great purchase! Its a beautiful piece to give to a love one or to a special someone! A great find at a low price!
5,Beautiful Ring,"I bought this for my 17 year old daughter who had seen a small heart shaped ring at the Coach store and liked the style. This one was much cheaper and ended up being so much prettier! It's really an eye catching ring, doesn't look cheap and sparkles beautifully. I am actually ordering her a second ring since she will be leaving for college next month and is worried about losing it. I think she'll like knowing there is a spare ring at home just in case and for the price it's not a big deal. She wears this ring on her right ring finger instead of her high school ring because she loves it that much. I would suggest this ring for any fan of hearts and a little bit of bling!"
2,Ring is Not Silver!!,"I have ordered this ring twice, the first time it started turning a very dark grey color so I returned it thinking I loved it so much I would give it another try. I have had my new ring for two weeks and the same thing is happening. I love the design of this ring, but very disapointed that it is not real silver,only plated."
4,Looks like a more expensive ring,I love this ring. It was very inexpensive but looks like it would have cost more. Very pleased with my purchase.
1,Sad daughter,"I am thinking this ring is not silver! I ordered this ring for my daughter's 16th birthday, thinking it was sterling silver and was ok with the CZ not real diamonds. It has already started turning a very dark grey color on the band and is only a little over 1 month old. I checked today to see about returning it and it is 5 days past. I love the design of this ring, love the bling, but very disapointed that it is not real silver,only plated."
4,Heart ring,"I recieved the ring and was not dissapointed.I will have to see if it holds up and stays this pretty. If so, I would give it a 5 star. Time will tell the story. But as far as its appearance it is a pretty ring. And of course I shop all the time on Amazon!"
1,do not undestand other high rated reviews,"I bought this ring after closely checking out many positive reviews. OMG, the ring itself is a keychain. It scratches ugly period. I can stand the quality of the heart shaped stone that didn't shine as much I hoped it would but for the price I paid, I am fine with that. The ring part of this product was a total disappoiintment. The other ring I bought based on positive reviews turned out satisfactory BUT not this ring. I am really lost with this product I received. Maybe I just got a bad luck with a bad batch or something."
5,Heart ring,Pleasantly suprised with the overall looks of the ring. Grand daughter loved it. Good value. Cubic zirconia are dazzling and well put together.
3,Pretty shiny,I've worn it several times and it's held up well but it just doesn't really knock me out. A good ring to wear when I don't have another one to match my outfit.
5,Promise ring for my girls,I wanted an inexpensive ring as a promise ring for my girls. This was perfect. I thought it was even prettier in person. They loved it.
5,Perfect!,"I loved it in the picture, and I loved it more once I saw it. The size 5 fit my middle finger perfectly, and I absolutely adore it. Quality for cheap."
5,Beautiful ring,"Bought this at the last minute as a stocking stuffer. What a hit it was. So cute, packaged nicely, my daughter loves it!"
4,Very Nice ring,I was very surprised when I received my ring. It is very cute and sparkles just like real diamonds. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
4,NICE RING!!,This ring came and it was packaged nicely. I opened it to find a cute ring. It actually exceeded my expectations. I had ordered other jewelry I wasnt happy with but this one was great! Have been wearing it alot and banging it around and so far stones are still in tact!!!
4,a weekend read,this book was good but i wish it was longer because it got really good at the end. and it was only 300 pgs! and it left it wide open for a sequel. i did find similarities between her and kerrilyn sparks. so if you like this book you'll like sparks or vice versa.i think i would buy the sequal if there was one.
1,yawn,"slow moving book overall. One main character Alexis is mean sprited, entire life a train wreck (in her own head). Vicious, and mean.Boring love/sex scenes, didn't care at that point - was hoping the hero would walk away and find a real person (or vampire).Zero ending - conflict not resolved. hero supposedly running for president of vampires, don't find out if he wins....gee, is the ending just a set up for next yawner?Love vampires, disliked this book"
2,Disappointed,"Although I enjoyed the writing style very much, and parts of it made me laugh out loud, the romance was too graphic for me. If you're a fan of graphic romance novels combined with a paranormal story, this may be the book for you. I did not enjoy it however, and I won't be reading any more of this series."
3,Cute story but VERY predictable...,"2 sisters and a vampire politician... sounds like the beginning of a joke, huh? That's the premise for this really cute story! Unfortunately, after the first chapter or so you can kind of see where the story is going. The last couple of chapters seem quite rushed too. It's still good though and a quick read if you're looking for something that's not too full of details or character development."
3,"Don't bet too high on this one, but don't fold on it, either","I found the plot rather thin and the characters a little stereotyped (nice-guy vampire, tough girl lawyer, loner vamp as secondary character), but the comedic elements kept me chortling. The pacing of the story is a little rushed, and I could have stood to see the heroine come to realize a little later in the story that the hero's vampirism is more than LARPing gone too far. But the vampire politics are a gentle rip on human politics, and almost more interesting than the romance element. The Las Vegas backdrop is well-described and a logical place for vampires to hide in plain sight. Good for a summer read, but I don't think this one could stand to more than one read-through."
2,Not my favorite EM...,"I love Erin, but this is not my favorite. Is it me or was the Vamp main character a big weanie and the female a shrew? The story over simplified. I am from Vegas, and did enjoy the Las Vegas back drop. A perfect place for a vampire world, just not a great story."
4,Definitely worth a read,"Very creative, easy read. Great characters and story line. Series is a good one when you need to turn-off. I'm a mid-thirties, corporate, working mom. I like to relax and enjoy a good. This was right up my alley."
3,High Stakes: A Tale of Vegas Vampires,I thought is was a funny and interesting book to read. The writer keep you interested in the book.
2,One for the trash bin.,"I've never read the others in the series. But I don't think that matters. The characters in this book were poorly written and without much substance. I thought Brittany was more interesting than Alexis even as much as she was written to be the one to hate on for being optimistic, sunny and attractive. Alexis was one obnoxious, caustic, ridiculous and annoying woman from the beginning. Her dialogue was painful to read and that part where she tries to beat up Ethan with her amazing black belt skills was dumb. I liken her more to an annoying yapping chiuaua than the bad girl that ""I think"" Erin McCarthy was trying to portray her as.I really like My Immortal so this was a real disappointment. Not sure if I will continue with her books."
1,What the hell is this?,This is NOT the book I bought. This isn't even anything by Erin McCarthy. I'm literally possessed and I want my money back.
5,A Refreshing View,"I found this book to be a refreshing, compelling read. The Iraq War and the post-war counter-insurgency are two of the most polarizing issues facing both the American public and the world at large. Unfortunately, the public is more often than not presented only one side of the story. Zinsmeister deftly exposes the pessimistic attitude that permeates much of the reporting of the ""main-stream media"" and unquestionably affects the way in which much of the information we receive is disseminated. Utilizing his experience as an embedded combat reporter in some of the most volitile areas in Iraq, Zinsmeister presents a credible, fact-based argument in favor of the President's approach to foreign policy in post 9/11 America."
2,The Freindship of Women,"I gave a copy of this book to everyone in a group of women friends I have when we all went away for a weekend. We had fun reading about the friendship of the women of the Bible and why they are important in todays context, however we all wish that each story was much longer, more indepth and more detailed. Nice read for a weekend."
2,Creepy and annoying!,"My daughter, who just turned two, has never liked this DVD, and neither do I. It scares her-especially the creepy flower played by Caroline Rhea. The moms are annoying, the songs are unimaginative, and it just drags on and on. The worst part is that, everytime the DVD almost succeeds in putting a child to sleep, it screams them back to consciousness! It does this twice, after nice, quiet parts: my least favorite is after the singing of the lullabies, when Caroline Rhea suddenly starts screaming out ""CAMPTOWN RACETRACK FIVE MILES LONG, DOO DAH, DOO DAH""!Homestly, don't waste your money, especially if you're wanting to use it at bedtime. It's annoying, ineffective, and just downright ""weird"", for lack of a better word!"
4,A Delightful Movie,"My 16 month old just loves this movie. It was given to him as a christmas present on VHS, and I am currently buying it on DVD so it can play in his own room. He falls asleep to it every night, and you never here a peep out of him while it is on. I think it is a great movie!"
4,Its Perfect!!,I ordered this before 9 months for my 2001 Toyota Avelon and its still working awesome. Battery back up is wonderful and it works nicely from around 15 meter distance.
4,Nice alternate to new factory key fob!,"about half the price of a new one. These are hard to find and it was nice to be able to pick up a used one.Still had to be programmed and the instructions were clear, but it didn't work at first. I called tech support and they were able to walk me through the sequence. Turns out that one of the steps needed to be changed on the instructions. Everything works now and I am very happy!"
5,Charming!,"The Little Fugitive is a wonderfully simple tale of a young boy and his brother. The young lad runs away from home because he thinks that he's killed his brother (a prank of course) and spends the day at Coney Island. The dialogue is very sparse. There's no need for it. Also, it's very interesting that a hand held camera was used especially back in those days. Coney Island buffs will enjoy seeing the park when it really was an amusement park. Today's Coney Island pales in comparison. Even I, who thought I knew everything there was to know about Coney Island, never knew that there were places under the boardwalk where you could return soda bottles.This film is very kid friendly. No foul language, nudity or sexual situations. Watch it with your kids. These are the good old days!"
3,A nice surprise,"Watched it for curiousity of Coney Island footage and followed the story to its end. remarkable how few words are in the entire film, yet leaving you with a smile. the plot is barren but its innocence is fulfilling. perhaps I'm a biased New Yorker but I find this a classic. As for the storyline, read the other reviews; I just feel its youthfulness and scenery are contently enough."
2,"Great film, poor product","This is an amazing film, having seen it on Turner, BUT the manufacture of this DVD makes it junk. The DVD will not play beyond the initial screen (play,features, etc). I have ordered this DVD from four different vendors and EVERY ONE IS DEFECTIVE IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. Amazon was the most expensive but having bought from Amazon many times, I had hopes for a good product, but I was wrong.KINO has a defective master and is churning out defective copies of this great little movie.It is a shame."
2,peice of junk,I bought one. The first time I used it I had to unconnect it and connect it agian and agian.But the controll looks cool.
1,beware - three units failed within weeks,"Stay away from these controllers. I bought four on extreme sale with coupon, and three stopped functioning within the first month. The fourth is still new in box, waiting for the next garage sale."
1,One star for one track!,"Chant to the sun, was the opening soundtrack for the late great WNEW 102.7 FM New York city disc jockey - Alison Steele the night bird."
2,"Not Lego, but fun","Our boys enjoyed building these, but there are definite draw backs in quality.The biggest issue I have with it is that its not really as pictured on the box. I can only presume that was the marketing's target product, but there are several difference from what you end up with. The main differences are in the wings, and the cab area, neither are nearly as realistic as the box implies (see image I've uploaded for what it looks like built).The second issue we have is durability. Presumably Lego has some secret plastic formula that make their stuff work well, but these blocks alternate between requiring force to put together, or spontaneously disassembling themselves. I can only assume heat or elasticity of the plastic is to blame, but it is very frustrating for a young engineer."
1,Fun for none,"I didn't realize it was possible to make plastic bricks so badly. These ill-fitting pieces either fit so loosely that they fall apart, or require great pressure to jam together. Instructions are confusing. Not a fun toy."
1,BEST LOCK DOES NOT STAY TOGETHER,"This birthday present for a 5 year old was a disaster. Even adults couldn't get this thing to stay attached. The whole thing fell apart 3 times trying to connect the final pieces. ""this toy is a dud"" said the 5 year old. It is getting sent back. Pay the money and get lego."
2,Missing instructions,"The box of this Space Shuttle we received (not from amazon) contained no instructions! Maybe I'm unlucky, or maybe the company is slipshod."
4,Great for many reasons,"The best thing about this toy isn't the shuttle you can build. My 4 year old knocked that out in 10 minutes. The fun began when he started making a fleet of little ships out of it. All legos are like that, but this set especially lends itself to re-creation."
5,Outstanding,"I hadn't bothered to check out Mastering CF until just recently. I had doubts about whether it'd be worth it to bother. Well, what a mistake! I finally bought this book and have been reading it over the past week. I've been through Forta's books and all of Allaire's classes (Fastrack to CF, Advanced CF, and CF Performance Tuning), but was still confused in some areas. Mastering CF has done an amazing job of making sense of just about every area that I didn't fully understand. I very highly recommend it!"
4,Well Organized,"I'm an Active Server Page programmer that was curious about all the hype surrounding Cold Fusion. I came across this book and decided to give it a read. I've read many, many, many computer books. Probably over a hundred, and this one is organized about as well as I've seen. What I admire most about the layout is how the author breaks down topics into small sections or chapters. Too often, in computer books, several challenging concepts get mixed together and make for very long and confusing chapters with overblown examples. This book book does a good job at avoiding this. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 due to buggy example code."
4,This is a good start.,"My critiques are scattered throughout the Internet and I will continue to torture those who put lousy books out to the public. I am not a programmer and too many books are written by programmers who have zero literary and common sense. I am attempting to construct a Web site for my industry where I do not have to hire a truckload of expensive programmers and go down the tubes in the process. We decided on Cold Fusion for a lot of reasons, one of which was its easier learning curve when compared to other solutions. It is not a perfect answer to our needs, but it beats out many higher priced alternatives that are harder to learn and implement. My quest for learning Cold Fusion was based on the way we all naturally learn...step by step, (recipe format) and through repetition a skill is learned. I look for books like this and this book is a good start. It can be improved. However, I am in a generous mood and the four stars is deserved."
2,My 2 Cents,"I'm afraid I was disappointed with this one.Since everyone in the ColdFusion community knows that Ben Forte's The Coldfusion 4.0 Web Application Construction Kit (Cold Fusion 4) is the bible for ColdFusion, I expected this new book, Mastering ColdFusion 4, to have some developers' inside scoops / tricks to better application building. Alas, no... the info in this book is readily found in the ""bible.""Also, many of the examples in this book uses numbers and Xs and Ys (like Algebra!) which doesn't make it very straight-forward to follow and understand. Ben Forte's book uses a fictitious company, A2Z BOOKS, and his examples are of the bookstores employees and book inventories - and it was very simple to comprehend.Hope this helps fellow CF developers."
4,Mastering the Basics....,"Mastering ColdFusion 4 is a little beyond the scope of this book. However, for those new to ColdFusion, it is an excellent primer and will quickly get you up to speed and writing ColdFusion templates that do everything from form processing to mailing to user session tracking. It lacks the depth of some other ColdFusion texts, but has all of the key ingredients in a clear and easy to read format that makes it easy to assimilate."
4,Useful resource,I bought the book and found it to be valuable in describing certain concepts that the Forta books were unclear about. The book takes a different approach to writing CF code (at times) and its always useful to see another approach. I like it and would recommend it. There is utility here!
2,Excellent Content Lacking A ColdFusion Reference,I really liked the content and how it was structured compared to the Cold Fusion book by Allaire. But with this high praise comes one major problem. This book is written and for beginning-to-intermediate Cold Fusion users but does not contain a Cold Fusion tag or function reference. It is only included on the CD. For someone learning this is very impractical.
2,"Ok intro, lacks depth","I have never used Cold Fusion and was directed to this book as the first to read before others. The book did give me an ok understanding of the general concepts behind CF, but the information is hardly worthy of ""mastering"". The book covers many topics but with insufficient depth. Furthermore, I am convinced that the authors were paid by volume considering the annoying excess of repating the same code (when only a few lines hvae changed) or the continual use of redundant ""Notes"" (how many times do I have to be told where to get the sample code or that they are using a sample database). There are some minor errors in the book, including a reference in the last chapter to the next three chapters."
1,WTF is this,"OK I know the turtles were hitting a new low through out the 90's, Ninja Turtles III, The Coming out of our Shells tour, now this amd the christmas special? I know trying to send a message, but what message? This is just god awful in the losest possible way with the Ninja Turtles name on in."
4,Another good product from Queen Helene,"I love using Queen Helene masques/peels, so when I saw this I had to try it. It left my skin really soft and smooth, and the smell is nice, sort of citrus-y honey. The reason I only gave is 4 stars is because it's hard to apply, even more so than the grape extract one. It's very thick and dries quickly, so I have to put more pressure when applying it and I have to do it quick. But other than that, it does what it says. Also, the scent isn't as harsh as the grape peel.I definitely recommend getting this!"
1,Placing north wherever you want it to be,"The watch ticks like a champion and the compass does whatever it pleases. It spins freely. If you don't care whether north is south and east is west then this watch is for you.By the way, I thought the orientation trouble might be that the compass I received was broken so I took it to their warehouse to exchange it for another. I was presented with a case of Avalon watches. Each watch's compass was pointing in a different direction. The comic factor made the trip worth while."
4,One of the greatest TV movies of the 70s,"Dan Curtis, the man responsible for Kolchak: The Night Stalker, Trilogy Of Terror, and other horror classics from 70s Television delivers a horror filled masterpiece with ""Curse Of The Black Widow."" It plays out much like an episode of Kolchak, so fans of that series will love this movie."
1,Scorpion With Two Tails,"Avoid at all costs! This was a made for TV film so if you are looking for the usual amount of sex, violence, and good storyline this is not the film for you ( there isn't any blood in the entire production). Don't be duped into thinking this is another Curse of the Scorpions Tail or Strip Nude For Your Killer (which is how they are marketing this one), it is most definitely not. Even the presence of John Saxon can't save this awful production. Stay away! Get The French Sex Murders instead, it is much more fun!"
4,A Two Part Album,"Another successful attempt by Faye Wong in her venture into some really alternative music. The first five tracks of Fable is composed by Faye Wong, herself, much to the excitement of many Faye Wong fans. The lyrics of the first five tracks, penned by Faye's good friend, Lin Xi, oozes much creativity as it takes listeners onto a journey of romance between a prince and his princess. And hence the name of the album , Fable. The linkage between these five songs is so strong that, the subsequent tracks seem to come from a separate album. Track 6 - 10 are more mainstream and generally more pleasant to the ears. My personal favourite is track 8, ""I Like It More Than You Do"". A must for all avid Faye Wong fans, but not a very good introduction to new listeners of Faye Wong."
4,Fable,I don't think this is her best album. However it's very good. I mean it's more than enough to buy this CD. Listen to the track 1. The song is inauspicious (I think) and Faye's voice sounds very opera/oratorio/chant-like. Just brilliant.
4,Warm Childhood Memories,"My father has been addicted to old westerns from as far back as I can remember, so cowboy music flooded my childhood home on a regular basis. Listening occasionally to that genre of music now fills me with warm memories from my earliest years. This particular collection is a good choice for someone like me who wants only a taste of cowboy music, but a quality one nonetheless."
4,very good,Received CD quickly. Met quality stated by seller. The recordings are clear-excellent quality for how long they have been around. I recommend this CD for those who enjoy this group.
4,"Not ""ultimate,"" but not bad","I wouldn't consider this the ""ultimate"" Sons collection myself, but it's a nice introduction to the group and an overview of their long and varied career.There is one small error in the liner notes, however: Mr. Zwisohn states that Tommy Doss takes the lead on Riders in the Sky. While it's true Tommy Doss replaced Bob Nolan in 1949, Bob was around long enough to take the lead on this track. According to Zwisohn's notes in the Wagons West box, Bob Nolan was not too fond of the song when Stan Jones presented it to him for the first time. He didn't like the fact that the melody was derived from Johnny Comes Marching Home. It was, thus, somewhat ironic that he--Bob Nolan--took the lead on the Sons' first version of the tune, which is the version included in both Wagons West and the Ultimate Collection.For an inferior (but still enjoyable) version that does feature Doss's vocals, see 1959's Cool Water LP (also available on CD)."
2,Get the Cool Water collection instead.,"I remembered hearing my folks play the old ""Cool Water"" record when I was a kid, and it made me pick this up. ""Ultimate Collection"" is an over-statement though. It's good because we gets songs from the 30's through to the 50's, a lengthy 21 tracks, and it's most of the good stuff. Included are the classics ""Way Out There"", ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"", ""Blue Prairie"", ""So Long To The Red River Valley"", and of course ""Cool Water"". However I do sorely miss ""Whoopee-Ti-Yi-Yo"", ""Cowboys Dream"", and the excellent ""Wind"". Where this disc really fails is the sound. It's horrible, and sounds like it was copied from a record. Like my title says, the Cool Water collection has every song I would want, and sounds much better. Better artwork too."
4,"A good overall view on how places can attract investment, industry and tourism","This is one of the first books dealing with the subject of place marketing, yet it does not only focus on the tourism destination aspect, but also considers a number of other elements that contribute to the wealth of cities, states and nations. There are many case studies, almost all about places in the USA."
3,Started slow....,but ended well. I do have to admit that it did keep me asking the question of 'Who did it?' for quite a while. Nice read to pass the time.
3,Just for kids,This is a fun book for kids with good information on watching birds. The cartoon book format might actually get kids outdoors. Give this and a pair of binoculars as a gift.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this video for my 4-year-old son who wanted to do yoga with me, but found my tapes a little boring. My son and I were both annoyed by the fact that this tape was only 13 minutes long. In addition, the teacher moves through positions very rapidly, does not explain them well, and repeats many of the same movements over and over again. I think a yoga tape for kids is a great idea, but this tape just didn't fit the bill. After trying it a few times, my son decided to go back to using my tapes."
5,A flawless book!,This book is exellent. It talks about numerous animal rights issues covering many aspects of them. You can read it from cover-to-cover or jump to a section that you're interested in. It is really wonderful as a guide for beginners and experienced alike. It has resources of organizations and stores. I have nothing negative to say about it! It's GREAT!!!
1,Beware of the Kindle Edition,"I received the Kindle edition of this book as a gift, and I found too many errors, probably introduced by OCR software. Regretably it seems as there is no way of reporting this kind of product failures."
5,Great Book,"Whether you are breaking up with a mate or whether you are trying to heal from the emotional wound of abandonment in your youth, this book will have something for you. Susan Anderson takes the readers on the road to healing chapter by chapter from the immediate shock of separation to the reconnecting with the world with a healthy sense of reality. I recommend that individuals who have been abandoned anytime time in their life and have had to cope with the multiple fears that accompany that abandonment should read this book."
5,Abandonment Book,I lent my book to my aunt and ended up giving it to her beacuse she fell in love with it and it truly is an eye opening book that helps with abandonment issues and i would receommend it 100% for anyone looking for self help or to pass it on to someone who seeks help.
4,Journey from Abandonment to Healing,"As I have read this book that a friend suggested to me, I see myself in it all over. Coming from a dysfuntional family of alcoholism and having been in relationships that have ended up in infidelity of my partners, this book has been very helpful in the healing process. I suggest this book to anyone who is going through a divorce or lost relationships. It has been very helpful.The book arrived so quickly and in great condition. Very nice."
3,Not that helpful for me,"If you are having a really hard time with your self esteem after your separation, this book may really help you out. I bought it about 3 months after being left by my husband of 13 years. I had already done a lot of soul searching and did not feel like I could not go on. I found myself skimming through most of the book and did not find the exercises to be terribly helpful in my situation. It focuses most on getting through the initial shock/pain and low self esteem that is associated with blaming yourself for the whole situation. I was already past the shock and while willing to acknowledge my own mistakes in our marriage, did not feel that the failure was entirely was my fault."
5,So helpful,This book should be read and worked with by anyone who has been LEFT by someone.It is excellent for helping with the healing process.
4,Steps towards healing:,The Journey is just that. A journey that begins with a single step. While telling her story the author also invites others to take their own journey from woundedness to healing. Knowing that others have walked this same path makes it easier to see that you can walk the same path and arrive at your own healing.
1,I don't know what the fuss is all about,"To be kind, I should say that perhaps I am way past the stage in my journey for this to be helpful. I might have benefitted from this when I was still in shock and grief. I was looking for a way to help me re-make myself- a way to truly figure out how to rebuild my life and get on with it. This wasn't it for me. I had the book in my hands less than two days before I traded it on another site.If you are in the healing the pain stage, perhaps this will help. If you have accepted the pain and are now at the stage of what do I do now and how do I make sure I don't get back here again, not so much..."
5,Great book,"I am just now reading it and it holds my attention. It offers on how to cope and deal with the loss of loved ones not just abandonment. It has techniques and is very well written to where you understand exactly what it's saying. I don't regret this purchase one bit. Would definitely recommend it for those having a hard time dealing with loss/abandonment/rejection. It is spot on how to cope and deal with it, especially if your'e going through it right then in the moment."
4,Great read,Helped with going through a difficult time. Helps In ways of looking at things in a different or fresh perspective. Nice to know others have experienced what I have and survived. Life is good!
4,Ebook from Amazon,I am currently going through a divorce after 21 years of marriage and it was a complete shock to me. This book has helped me understand what I am feeling and going through. I recommend this book to help in the healing process.
5,Absolutely essential,"I rarely write book reviews on Amazon, especially self-help books. Susan's book is just a totally essential book for anyone who's either ""been left"" in a relationship or who has ""had to leave,"" even if they didn't want to (i.e. emotionally abandoned). I hope other authors build on her solid base. Great stuff."
1,Expensive Bootleg,"It is being heavily argued that this dvd is not legal, and with good argument. Bottom line for the potential buyer- the audio pitch is off, distorting the entire soundtrack, there is missing footage, there are no extras, and it costs as much as a blu-ray. BUYER BEWARE!Check Mya Communications track record, it speaks for itself and it ain't pretty."
2,Horrible Horror film,"I bought this for a friend, and she said it was not like the movie that she remembered it to be. She was rather disappointed in it. She decided to keep it though. I watched it with her and since I had never seen it, I couldn't compare. I don't care for horror films, so i didn't particularly like it."
4,I need the little fireman,My nephew recieved the tonka fire truck for Christmas 3yrs ago. This Christmas our family dog chewed his little fireman up (on accident). He's 5 and cried for 15 minutes. Is there anyway you can purchased just the little man or anybody not want the little man that comes with it.
3,TAKE NOTE!,"I bought this truck for my son's 2 b-day in sept. and a week later the thing that makes the ladder go up stopped working, I thought it was batteries but nothing changed. In Dec. I bought the garbage truck because he went crazy for it when he saw it. when I got it out of the box, I was showing him how it works, and found out that the thing that makes the trash can go up, does not work either!!!! What a big disapointment for me and for him! It could have being so much fun if these trucks would have work like they are supposed to."
1,Not a horror Movie!,The movie was about a guy named David who gets this house after his uncle drowned. The house is near a lake that has been haunted by a ghost of a gypsy witch. The lake has a reputation for people drowning. David eventually meets the lady of the lake. Who is she? And why are people drowning in the lake? Buy the movie today and find out!This movie was not scary at all! The reason I rented this video was the great special effects the movie supposely had from what the cover said.
3,good start,"Maurice Devereaux is a young independant director from a province of Canada called quebec. He did this movie with almost nothing but it's a good start. The picture is filmed very well, especially in in the underwater scenes. He made what he could with a bunch of actor that are not professionals to begin with. Sometimes the movie makes you think a little bit about Raimi's Evil dead, because of its rythm and its medieval esthetics. It's definetely worth a look, even if this one's not going to become your favorite."
1,awful...,"I watched this movie just last night, or at least I tried to...The acting is terrible, except for the two leads, who weren't too bad. I'm not a big fan of horror, preferring to get my scares through the old-fashioned way where a frightening scene is actually scary, not just bloody.The underwater scenes, I will admit, were quite good, but that's all the good I can see in this film. As for the rest of it...I'll just leave this with one more comment about so-called scary movies:""The scariest movie shows not what you are afraid of, but lets you imagine it and be scared."""
5,Key to undestanf statistical physics,The postulational approach is really great. This book tooks away all the question I had about the connection between thermodynamics and statistical physics. I think it's a good idea to read Fermi's thermodynamics also. To see how smart one can be when using thermodynamics.
2,"A decent thermo text, but for stat mech...","I nearly hurt myself laughing when I read the book description that claimed this book could serve as both a thermo and stat mech text. The first 4/5 of the book, which covers thermodynamcs, is fairly well done. Chapter 7, and the problems at the end, were particularly good. Statistical mechanics is inroduced during the last 1/5 of the book, almost as an afterthought. This section has no redeeming qualities. The problems are awful, the exposition is terrible, and the connection with QM is not developed. There is no reason to use this book when both Landau's and Reif's books are available."
3,Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics,"This book cannot be practical for freshmen, novice, person who has a chance to begin thermodynamics.I just suggest that Open Course Ware such as MIT or something like this.It is hard to make a concept what thermodynamics is."
4,A classic text on the fundementals of Thermodynamics,"The books overview of the fundementals of thermo is without rival. This book lays out the laws of thermo in a postulate form. From these postulates you can derive the entire theroy of classical thermo. This can be used to solve practical problems and derive thermodynamic relationships. It is a great refference.This book takes you through the theory of thermo, but for a more practicle look at thermo see Smith and Van Ess Introduction to thermodymanics for chemical Engineers.The first half of this book is perfect for the begining chemist or Chem Engineer. It is a great book for grad students alsoI give this book five stars for the first half the second half is not all that great. Buy T. Hills Introduction to Statistical Mechanics for the thermostatistic part. It is from dover press and is cheap all Hills books are great and from dover."
5,Fantastic precise saw (when using a good blade),"I bought this saw with the intention of trimming out my entire house and have not been disappointed thus far. I've done casing, chair rail, wainscot, baseboard and crown and it's on the money. The tuning instructions were easy to follow and by running through each one and correcting where necessary, the saw is perfectly tuned. To the reviewer who has detected a flex in the blade, I had the same problem using a Freud Diablo 80 tooth blade - the problem was the blade, not the saw. I have since replaced it with an 80 tooth Dewalt woodworking blade and cuts are straight and super accurate. Definitely my favorite tool purchase of the last year."
1,Selling What They Don't Have!!,"I ordered this saw on March 12, Amazon said that it would ship within a couple weeks, 7 weeks later I received a notice today that it would be delayed another 4 weeks. What a damn joke. I have bought my last item from Amazon!"
2,"Bosch 4212L - Excellent except, it doesn't run","I bought this saw about a year ago. Made about 100 cuts, saw was working as I had expected until it started tripping breakers (20 amp) last month. I've swapped breakers two times, all breakers trip as soon as the saw is started."
4,Heavy duty miter saw,"I gave this tool 4 stars because the first saw I received was NOT LEVEL. Did not sit flat. Turned it 90 deg and it still wobbled. Put it on the table saw ( very flat table) still rocked. Sent it back. The next one was dead on. All adjustments were right on out of the box. Replaced the blade with a forrest chop saw blade. I use a Dewalt at my woodworkers club so I can compare Dewalt and Bosch. The Bosch is very much better. So the saw itself deserves 5 stars, the fence is very usefull as is the hold down. The laser works ok but you have to get used to it."
5,Bosch does it again,"This a nice heavy well constructed miter saw. The saw is adjustments are smooth and precise. My only gripe is the the right bevel tilt is a little corky in that you must slightly tilt the saw to the left and spin a dial to get the pin released so, the right tilt is possible. Other than that the saw performs wonderfully. The saw is well thought out for ergonomics and engineered well.Please note that this saw is big in size and heavy. It stands 31"" tall when the blade is up, it is about 30 inches deep from front to back without the dust bag attached (attached it is another foot or so).Strongly recommend this saw.Please read review on the Bosch TracRac Portable Miter Saw Stand - T3B that I use with this saw."
5,"Cuts like a ""Champ""","Easy to use and ""dead on"" out of the box. Buy a finer blade for super fine cuts. The one sold with the saw is a little rough for finish work. The saw is incredily quiet, even my kids can sleep when I run it in the basement below them. The laser is definitialy worth the money, but I still mark and cut. It is really heavy, so if you are a portable one person do-it-yourselfer you may want a lighter saw."
2,4 Stars - actually,"This is a great Saw. The front bevel control is good and the adjustments are easy to make. I wish the laser was on both sides though. I took out a star because recently, while cutting oak, the blade hit the metal chip deflector, broke the blade, the chip deflector and the blade guard. Though I was greatly displeased with the local Authorized service center (hence 2 stars originally), regional management followed up on the repair and made everything right. A+ for such an excellent service.Customer Service takes about 40% of my decision making when buying a product. Therefore, unless one brand product is better then the other by 40% I go with the better customer service. For those reasons I purchase primarily Bosch.Great Job Bosch."
5,Great chop saw,"The first saw we received was totally unusable. I tried to get my money back, but it had been too long sitting in the box, so I had to accept a replacement. The replacement saw has been the best saw we've ever had in 11 years in our cabinet shop. We've had several Makitas, Hitachi, and others. This saw is the smoothest, best cutting, and most pleasant to use. We haven't had it long enough to tell you how long lasting it is in a commercial shop. I'm baffled as to how one saw could be as defective as the first one was, and the second absolutely top notch."
5,Sobering,"Anyone interested in the Holocaust(even those that aren't)need to watch this. Many additional facts they may not know about. Keep a tissue handy! Not for little kids, very graphic photos."
4,Good solution,"The Epson Axis 1440 print server has allowed me to easily network my Epson printers. Also when connected to Apples Airport base station, it has allowed wireless printing throughout my household."
5,5 Stars for the Mattress topper 2 for the pillow.,"I have dreaded going to bed the last few years because I was in excruciating pain when I woke up.The mattress topper has made a profound difference in my pain- although the pillow- not worth $45.I still use my neck roll. I tried the pillow once and woke up with no feeling in my hands. They were numb and tingly like they used to be before the neck roll I got for Christmas.BTW the neck roll, if you have neck pain or nerve damage is from Earth Therapeutics."
4,nice pad,it helps ... but a year later and still no pillow ... just forget it from this company.Due to the BS about the free pillow I say don't buy it from them.If you have the money get the whole mattress from temperpedic ... you need the density that cheap copies don't have.
3,Chunks are small,"The packaging is really nice and is a good way to store the chunks. However, I like the chunks to be a bit bigger so they don't burn up so quickly."
3,Good for Major Repairs,"This dated guidebook is well suited to someone with a home woodworking shop loaded with clamps and vises, and would like to tackle major guitar repairs, such a fixing a broken neck.But my ambitions were more modest: I wanted to diagnose and fix a buzzing fret, and to lower the action by deepening the nut slots and sanding down the bridge. These adjustments, although minor, are important, and can be screwed up if not done right.Unfortunately, this book was not much help to me. However, fret not (pun intended), Dan Erlewine's books and the Internet have come to my rescue."
4,Good Book But,Make sure you buy volume one first because the writer reverts back to it through out the book. There is times you will need volume one for certian measurments and the writer assumes that you have it. The photos are poor quality but the book all in all has good information about repairs
5,The Best,I can provide only a brief review as my time is limited. In a nutshell this is a book that any Luthier would benefit from. It is obvious that Mr. Teeter is a very precise craftsman whom does not take shortcuts. The information presented is the correct way to do whatever needs to be done. I would have to consider this the best of the books on lutherie that I own.
3,"Don't Buy, Re-Release is Coming ...woohoo",Put your credit cards away.... Its being re-released.. Anchor bay had sold off the rights to MGM a few years back.....Re-release.... 7 years after its first release on DVD..... Just Like night of the Comet was released a month ago (and they said that would never happen as a result of the MGM Master burning down in that warehouse fire when they lost all the prints).....Well... woohoo...... finally get to see it in its pristine condition........Serves these sellers right! haha
4,A Classic TV Movie for Halloween,"I first watched this movie when I was five years old and I still love it today. I try to have others watch it, but they hate it because they say it is ""cheesey."" But I don't care. This movie is for pure fun and entertainment. It is a blend of horror and comedy that make it an outstanding movie for people of all ages. I don't think it was intended to become the next Night of the Living Dead. If you want a decent thrill with the absence of gore and profanity, buy The Midnight Hour."
