2,Is this very good condition book??,"I just received the book that I ordered from go Hastings at Amazon..It said that the condition was very good. I didn't receive the very good condition book. It could be acceptable but I am 100% sure it is not very good condition book.Now, they change the price.. I'd better pay little bit more and get a better condition book.. Never use this company again..."
4,Scholars interpretation,"This is the perfect bible for me (not to mention my first) as it is a concensus of theologians understanding, interpretations of the traditional scriptures. This book offers introductions to most of the books which is helpful in setting the historical context. Must have for any historian or person looking seeking to understand the bible."
1,For liberal theologians,"Buyers beware, the Bible commentaries are written by liberal theologians. They tend to disbelieve miracles and try explaining away Divine prophecy by assigning late dates for the books. When I was reading the commentaries, I couldn't help but get the feeling that the writers were trying to destroy my faith. Also, while it is not a bad translation, the NRSV does have some gender-neutrality inserted into it. All in all, I cannot recommend this study Bible. It reads like skeptics and non-believers wrote it."
1,Harper Collins also publishes the Satanic Bible,"No matter how good or how poor this Bible Study Guide is - it's moot! How can anything good come from a company that plays both ends against us? ""You can not serve two masters!""Come on people ...WAKE UP!!! Go to their own Harper Collins website and type in ""Satanic Bible""!Yeah...like I'm going to find a Godly ""Study Guide"" from these guys!?!?"
3,Fun Kander and Ebb,"Great fun, nice catchy, bouncy Kander and Ebb score that should have run longer but was done in by an influx of nostalgic, old timer musicals (Follies and No, No Nanette were also running at the time), 70 Girls recieved mostly positive reviews. The wonderful Mildred Natwick leading a cast of mostly seniors, in a vaudevillian ""show within a show"" context (that was slightly confusing and altogether not needed), but with a score of one ""knock em outta the ballpark"" number after another. Several became staples in Liza Minelli's arsenal.Not Kander and Ebbs best, but catchy and fun all the same,....highly enjoyable!!"
3,"70, girs, 70","I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THIS CD. WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I AM A BIG KANDER AND EBB FAN. OH WELL, YOU WIN A FEW AND YOU LOOSE A FEW. LOOKING FORWARD TO CURTAINS"
4,a peculiar-yet beguiling Broadway musical,"70 GIRLS 70 was written by John Kander and Fred Ebb, best-remembered for their firecracker CABARET and CHICAGO scores. This 1971 offering was based on the British play BREATH OF SPRING (later turned into the film MAKE MINE MINK) about a motley group of seniors who steal furs and money from young people, in order to help the elderly and less-fortunate.The show featured an amazing lineup of regal old-timers headed by Mildred Natwick, Hans Conried and Lillian Roth, and also featured Henrietta Jacobson, Lillian Hayman, Dorothea Freitag and Lucie Lancaster. 70 GIRLS 70 shuttered after 35 performances.The score yielded at least one hit: ""Yes"", which became a staple in Liza Minnelli's repertoire for years. Other great numbers include ""Go Visit"" (a showstopping turn for Henrietta Jacobson and young Tommy Breslin); ""Coffee in a Cardboard Cup""; ""Broadway, My Street"" and ""The Elephant Song"".Still, a must-own for Broadway enthusiasts. [SONY SK-30589]"
4,"70,girls,70","I have been a fan of Kander and Ebb for sometime, and I have several of their CD's and or DVD's. I heard some selections from ""70, girls,70"" on a local radio station in Australia, and decieded to get a copy. I have not been disappointd, the delight of hearing Mildred Natwick, and Lillian Roth, is something not to be missed. Great Stuff. Up there with ""On the 20th Century"" and ""Steele Pier""Graeme Studd, Australia"
2,Boring!,"While I am a Kander and Ebb fan, this flop is rightfully put out of the standard spinning market. The songs are boring and the plot is not really understood (in the music or the liner notes.) The voices are... well, old. Its not really an engaging listen, with no great lyrics or message. Maybe an older person enjoys this, but there is little that I find enjoyable here. ""Coffee in a Cardboard Cup"" and ""Say Yes"" are not bad messages, and could probably be incorporated in a cabaret that would be enjoyable, but this CD is a pass. Only collectors are suggested to get this one."
3,70 girls 70 is ok,"There are some clever songs in this show, especially ""Old People"", but it has a confusing plot and some of the numbers are not particularly memorable. It's not one of my favorites, but I like it enough that I didn't try to take it back, as I did Steel Pier. It's basically about a bunch of old folks who turn to burglary to improve their life style."
4,A MUST FOR CLASSIC ROCK FANS.,"THIS CD IS A FINE EXAMPLE OF ROCK AND LIFE STYLES OF THE EARLY 1970'S. HENRY IS A FUN LOOK AT DRUG SMUGGLING OUT OF MEXICO BY SOME GUYS WHO WERE MORE INTEREST IN SAMPLING. GLENDALE TRAIN HAS A GREAT STORY SET TO GOOD MUSIC. EVERY SONG HERE HAS A COUNTRY INFLUENCE WITH THE LAID BACK STYLE OF THE 70'S. THOUGH NOT REAL OBVIOUS JERRY GARCIA'S INFLUENCE IN UNDENIABLE. TRY THE SONGS AMAZON HAS SET UP TO PREVIEW, YOU'LL SEE."
4,A forgotten gem of country rock,"In the early 1970's, a talented group called the New Riders of the Purple Sage was making waves as a popular touring act. They were born of the Grateful Dead - Jerry Garcia was a founding member, and the two bands toured together before the NRPS finally struck out on their own. Today, some of the band's live performances are being released on CD, so they are enjoying something of a comeback. This is the only studio album that includes Jerry Garcia, whose bold, unconventional playing of the pedal steel guitar dominates most tracks. Also included are three live bonus tracks. It's hard to place this album in any one genre - it is a bit country, a bit rock, and a bit bluegrass. Rock fans shouldn't shy away from trying this album because of its country stylings - if you are a fan of the Grateful Dead,the Allmans, the Band, or any of the other great Folk/Country/Rock bands of the 60's and 70's, you might find that this album is a delightful and addictive treat."
3,Its okay,"This movie is okay only because I didn't have to pay for it. If I had to pay, it would only get one star."
1,"This can hardly be considered true ""Laurel & Hardy""","Not a very good collection of ""Laurel & Hardy"" episodes at all. Most of the episodes contain their solo ""silent era"" work, which really isn't as good as their work together. The video has not been cleaned up at all either, so viewing many of them can be a chore. Unless you can't find ""Utopia"" and ""Flying Deuces"" elsewhere for a cheaper price, I cannot recommend this collection at all."
3,Slightly dissapointing,"I am a big Laurel and Hardy fan, and I was hoping for some of my favorites to be on this DVD, but most were silent films, and the one talkie was the one where they join the foreign legion."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Action Learning in Action Action learning has been around since the 1930s, but it can be used to improve organizations today. Michael J. Marquardt shows how. Basically, four to eight people work together to solve a problem, reflect on what they learn as they proceed and then implement their solution. Marquardt offers a clear step-by-step process and a few case histories. His focus on the original methodology may be a little heavy, but he aims to distinguish action-learning groups from multi-problem-oriented teams and work groups. The book is well organized, but if you already know about team building, leadership development and learning organizations, you'll be walking on familiar ground. That's why we at getAbstract.com recommend this book either to those who are so immersed in group learning that they find new nuance in everything in the field, or to those who are fresh to the subject, who will benefit particularly from the helpful charts, lists and illustrations."
2,Fluff,"I suspect the author and/or his friends are responsible for the positive reviews. This book has very little content. As one other reviewer writes the methodology described is this: ""Basically, four to eight [functionally diverse] people work together to solve a problem, reflect on what they learn as they proceed and then implement their solution."" This not-at-all groundbreaking process is couched in 227 pages of empty filler material -- fairly standard jargon about today's global business environment and excruciating amounts of redundancy. The foremost goal of writing this book seems to have been to get a book published, not to say anything."
4,More than an excelent value and quality,I bought this unit for a couple reasons: one) extending the distance away from the charging unit while talking 2) extending the amount of talk time on the individual charge 3) Competitive pricing was formost. I could not be happier with this home phone. Out performing even my most aggressive expectations. Thank You Uniden!
5,A Great Record,"This is maybe my favorite Dave Douglas recording (could change next week since they are all so good). As the title seems to suggest, I tend to play this one at night after my toddler has gone to bed. It is both stimulating and relaxing. Most of the songs have a slow to medium tempo and are performed in a somewhat relaxed manner. The instrumental combination and their arrangements are wonderful. Somehow, this music allows me to re-engage my mind while calming my body.As much as I love this, my wife hates it. If accordian and trumpet isn't your thing, perhaps you better stay away. But if your seeking a subtle yet rich tonal experience, this it it!"
4,"Great individual tracks, monotonous album","All the tracks on Douglas' CD play greatly on their own. Taken as a whole album, however, a slight note of monotony might creep in after track 7 or 8 -- many of the tracks share a similar mood and pace, and one might find oneself wishing for a bit of variety after an extended listening. However, that doesn't change the excellence of the performances and composition."
5,Excellent product.,Cats are playing with it all the time. They get a lot of exercise chasing the ball. The large size allows them to sit inside the ring. Excellent product.
3,It doesn't really interest my cat.,"I was hoping my cat would love this, but he really only seems mildly interest in playing with it. I have to move the ball around to get him to take notice of it. It's well made and may work for other cats, mine just doesn't seem to like it."
3,"Petmate Crazy Circle Interactive Cat Toy, Small",The cats like it but not as well as the one that has the illluminated ball that comes with another toy simular toy to this one.
4,Kitty approves!,"When we adopted our second kitten I bought toys that I thought both cats could enjoy (Kitty#1 was over a year old while *new*Kitty#2 was only 6 months). I found this in my local pet store and thought ""why not?"" Never did I imagine that it would become Kitty#2's favorite toy! She will play with it for over half an hour at a time. Kitty#1 occasionally will bat at it but prefers to watch Kitty#2 play. It has been almost 2 years and it is still a favorite with our finicky female!"
4,Good entertainment,I am always looking for something to entertain our fur children. As everyone knows this can be a challenge especially when it doesn't involve a human. This will. Just make sure you place it in a noise tolerant area.
3,It's Okay,The toy seems to be made well but our cat is not impressed - I'm planning to donate it to a local rescue.
3,Fun toy but be careful of edges.,"This is a cute toy that will excite your cat. The only problem, and it might be a big one, is the cheap plastic it's made out of. The edges are a bit sharp and slightly jagged in places. I would highly recommend supervising your cat during playtime and keeping this in the closet when you're not around. Maybe I'm too overprotective, but when it comes to our sweet furry guys, safety comes first."
3,"good for the kittens, but...","This toy is great for kittens, but you'll want to get something larger for your older cats. The access holes are a best fit for kittens. I originally bought this for my cat Dr Claw, but he had trouble playing with it even at an early age because he has extra claws, making his feet rather big for his age. We found another toy sporting a similar idea (plastic ball trapped in a circular run), but with larger access for him."
1,Cat did not like,My cat played with this a few minutes the first day we got it. After that he did not play with it at all.
2,Waste of time,"The item is a nice item, for about a week both cats played with it occasionally. Now it just takes up space. The problem I have with ordering this online was the wait. Had I suspected how long it would take to get it, I would have just driven to the nearest Petco or whatever. Shipping was high, delivery too long."
2,Pricey cat toy,"I have (2) 18 month old cats, who played with this toy 2 times, and only when I batted the ball around for them! Pretty pricey cat toy to be sitting around!"
3,great for kittens...,"I originally bought this to keep my cats entertained while I was away. They really seemed to enjoy the idea of the toy, but they had trouble getting their paws in to bat at the ball. All my cats have rather large paws. My cat with extra toes on his front paws had the most interest, and the most trouble. It quickly fell into disuse because of this. I eventually bought a similar toy with more access, which they still love over a year later. I suggest this toy to those with kittens or cats with small paws!"
5,endless amusement,"My cats have had this for 2 years and they still love it. They don't use it quite as often as they used to, but they do use it. Its still in perfect shape too considering that they wrestle it, chew on it, kick it, etc."
3,our cat also lost interest,"Our cat also lost interest after a short time, as did some of the other reviewers' cats..."
2,"Cats were bored, puppy loved Crazy Circle interactive toy.","We were hoping to find a toy to entertain our cats, but the cats were indifferent. On the other hand, our dog found this toy very entertaining. I do worry a bit about the sharp edges. Update review on 1/5/12: Our granddaughter stepped on the Crazy Circle and broke it. Whether that means it is fragile or prone to break, I do not know. The dog did love it and played with it often."
4,Great,"These gloves provide the flexiblity and the protection that I need. They aren't to thick so you can feel the work. A summertime glove, not so good at keeping your hands warm in winter months."
5,you will be surprised.,I was shocked at how many songs i ended up liking on my first listen.the remastered audio is a huge plus.
4,Love the rumble - but watch for trouble!,"Finally, the last speaker of my 5.1 setup! So I pop in the ""Blade"" DVD -- the added bass from this subwoofer sounded wonderful, and definitely brought a smile to my face. HOWEVER, about 30 minutes in the movie, it died! Kaput. So, off to the repair shop I go (JBL's warranty covered it completely), to discover that there was a bad diode. It was replaced, and once again I am smiling. It sounds great with bass heavy CD's as well, though the front firing speaker is a bit more directional than I would like. Overall (and after the repair), good speaker!"
1,JBL Junkie But Loud subwoofer guaranteed fire,"Do not buy one of these....I'm on my third one and it just quite tonight, JBL could not build a class D powered subwoofer that works to save their soul.If I were a manufacturer of garbage such as this I would recall all of them and pile them up and light a fire and pink slip every monkey engineer that had anything to do with the amplifier section!!this is the new milenium where china is building everything and we have to expect some failure rate but even their typical electonics MTBF percentage is less than 5% in the first year, these digital amplifiers are 100% failure rate guaranteed to fail in the most critical time frame middle of the movie with your Boss just getting commenting on your rig and kapoof the smake roles out of your sub and the smoke detector starts to wail!If you want to contact me Mr. JBL white collar guy send me an email or a new sub that won't break!"
2,Well it was very difficult to set it up with my sparc,I have a sparc with 1024 mb ram and i use it for mutimedia production. tjhe system just seemed to be a perfect choice for me. but i was dihearted.. to put in plain words. it sucked for that money i could have got a Altec lansing with bose woofer beat it !! If allah has given u brains dont buy this system... ya ali !!
1,"Oh, please!","I thought this wouold be a good introductory book but this is awful. Author is beyond condecending, portraying all the Russians as bunch of ignorant oafs, intent only on drinking. All the rulers, according to him, were interested only in orgies, drinking, eating and acting like complete fools. After reading this book, readers will have to wonder how Russia became one of the superpowers of the world and why aren't Russians still living in the caves."
5,Doghouse Pad works as described and is nice,My dog likes this pad. I'm training her in the house to use it so she hopefully doesn't tear it apart when I place it in her house. I like the way it fits into the Petmate Dog house.
1,Nice mat,Perfect for the dog house - but my dog ate it in five minutes - tore it to shreds. Wish there were one that he couldn't have destroyed.
3,destroyed,"This bed looked great when I took it out of the box. Thick foam and what appeared to be a tough, washable cover. After 3 days in the doghouse I found a large rip in the fabric. After a week it was completely destroyed. Now, I don't think this was an actual problem with the bed. It is much more a problem with my dog. If you have a destructive dog I would not recommend this, or any other bed for that matter."
5,Best Fusion Album Ever,"I honestly believe that this is the best Fusion album ever made. It is a must have for Jazz-Rock and Fusion fans, guitar freaks, and anyone interested in being moved by some fantastic instrumentals."
2,Letdown,Didn't really like it. For my ears it wasn't melodic enough and was to much of johns weird style in unison with the violin. Just sounded more like a crazy jam to me.
5,The Masterpiece,"This wonderful album continues to confound copyists and delight those with open minds and ears. In my view, the best rock/jazz album ever."
3,Love of Music,This album had a very unique style of beats. The way the guitar was meshed with all the other instruments was what appealed to me the most. I've not heard music like this before and thought it rather exciting. It picks you up and takes you for a ride.
3,Quite busy,"Very impressive combination of instruments working together that I had never heard before. The violin and guitar are very powerful together. So much, in fact, the drums take the backseat. This is unfortunate, because the drumming is excellent. Individually, all instruments are great, but the guitar overwhelms everything else, and can really get on your nerves at times because of the obvious gratuitiveness of it. The feeling of the sound covers the mood spectrum from one end to the other; gentle and melodic to absolute, annoying chaos. A good album to listen to and appreciate the unique musical value and guitar solos(if that's what you want). Not an album to throw on at a social event,though. It would probably make people leave if you left it on long enough."
4,a good album-- but a bit pompous and slow at times,"I'm primarily a rock and roll fan-- although I do listen to a lot of classic jazz. This is a masterful album, the playing is clear, well-concieved and well-executed. At times, though, it seems to run out of steam.A fusion band has a hard time ahead of it. Fusion lacks the simple, groovy... pop-rock. It also usually lacks the sort of distant, sophisticated cool of jazz. Because of this, the music often lacks soul despite the guitar pyrotechnics. Most of the time, I wasn't aware of what emotion the music was trying to bring across. I was moved-- just not always emotionally.I feel that this album often overcomes many of the problems of fusion. However, it is still pompous and a bit dull at times."
3,good enough,"It has its moments. The rib-crushing power of the electric instruments and Billy Cobham's manic drum work are impressive enough, but the compositions are less exciting. Think of it as '70s rock and roll with brains, and some jazz sprayed in, but don't expect much more."
1,"Collaboration, or competition?","This is a prime example of someone who should be doing a solo album attempting to do a collaborative musical effort. As I listened, I heard John McLaughlin overpowering his bandmates, over and over again. It was quite frustrating to only catch a glimpse of what his backing band could do. His guitar solos were overwhelming, and overdone, and I felt as if he were crying out, ""look at me, look at me!"" The entire album struck me as an attempt to show the world just how great John McLaughlin was, and not to show how wonderful the group worked as a band. It seemed to me that John McLaughlin did not want to be part of this band, but rather he wanted to be the entire band. This was not a group effort, but one man looking for attention."
2,Tim Aden,"McLaughlin went a little too far with this album. Although McLaughlin's guitar playing sounds sensational, it also sounds like a big show in his honor. He should try to give more credit to the other members of his band by giving them a chance to be heard. If you do like to here endless and at times pointless guitar playing then this is definitley the album for you."
4,The Seminal Fusion Album,"Mahavishnu orchestra were the pioneers in Jazz fusion Music way back in the 70's.No other band could match the sheer power and energy generated by this high voltage band.If you really enjoy Electrifying guitar work and have a taste for hard rock and Jazz coupled with Indian classical music then you should definitely give this album a try.This album crosses various Musical boundaries with utter disdain for conventionalities.The combination of Mclaughlin(guitar),Gerry goodman(violin),Jan Hammer (keyboards), Rick Laird (bass) and Billy Cobham(Drums) was the best the band ever had and together they were Sheer Havoc .There is a certain amount of dissonance and redundancy, but this is easily offset by the exceptional playing abilities of these virtuosos.This album falls behind 'Birds of fire' which I feel is compositionally more superior with lot of fireworks from Billy Cobham."
5,unreal,This is definitely the best album I have ever heard. I had no idea that this type of music was out there. Mclaughlin is unreal and cobham remains one of my favorite drummers. This is by far the most intense and awesome recording that I have ever heard and everyone should get a chance to hear it.
5,THE ONE THAT STARTED IT ALL!!!!!!,"This TRULY is a masterpiece!!!!! This album introduced us to the dynamic combination of John McLaughlin and Billy Cobham. Check out Vital Transformation for some phenomenal drumming and guitar work. Lest I forget, Jan (Miami Vice) Hammer is on keyboards along with Jerry Goodman and Rick Laird. This was the album that really pushed the envelope and combined jazz with rock. This album shows true musicianship at it's best. It's about 34 years old and STILL sounds as fresh and new today as it did back then. If you are a lover of great music and musicianship, this one's for you!!!!"
5,A must-have for anyone who likes actually good music,"the state of music in pop culture as of today is completely ridiculous. please, if you haven't already, buy this album to enjoy life to it's fullest extent. all your sins in actually liking the crap thats on the radio will be forgiven through buying this cd. whatever. this album is truely brilliant. phenominal musicianship."
4,Good,I ahev never read this book because it is courently out of print so i think thqat it wood be a good book
1,don't buy it.,"I had constant battery problems. It would tell me the backup battery needed to be replaced, then it would show the backup battery at 80%. The unit peeled all over the place.Finally, one day my unit died without explanation. New batteries did nothing for it. It is dead and this happened within one year of owning it."
2,Don't be fooled by the cover....,"There are a few worthwhile patterns in this book, but overall, the instructions are poorly written - other than a limited sample section, the pictures are all in black and white and the diagrams aren't very good. Unless you are experienced at this type of beading, look for a better book."
3,Don't know if it does anything or not,We installed this a few weeks ago and haven't really noticed any difference in our showers.
1,Did nothing for me. Needs to be redesigned.,"I bought one of these in the hopes of just getting rid of some of the stuff that makes my water hard. Unfortunately, this unit does nothing. My skin is still dry, and I notice no difference. Also, that threads that the showerhead is supposed to connect to are made of such a soft plastic, that they don't even strip, they simply fall off. I will not be buying another gimmick like this, I am gonna just save up my money for a real water softener. Don't waste your time with this item."
5,Culligan in-line shower filter,I love this filter. I was afraid it would decrease the flow of my shower. It does not. The replacement filters are not too expensive which was a major consideration in choosing this filter over others. I makes a huge difference in the smell of my water. There used to be a bleachy smell. It also makes rinsing off easier. My hair and skin are softer as a result of using this filter.
1,Buy at your own risk,"I bought this knowing about the common problem reported in the one star reviews: water squirting out from the connection between the shower pipe and filter. I thought I would get lucky, but I wasn't. The same thing happened to me. Buy at your own risk."
5,TLynnJack - first time review,"I've never reviewed an Amazon purchase before, but believe me, I've bought a lot of stuff from Amazon. But I had to put a review for this product, the Culligan ISH-100 Level 2 Inline Shower Filter. I've had this product one day and all I can say is WOW!I installed the filter last night, and it only took about 5 minutes with a pair of pliers for tightening. I took my first shower this morning, and I can't believe the difference in my water. I live in an area of Texas with a lot of lime and calcium in the water, so I've been looking for something easy that would help. This is it! I need to wash my hair every day and I could tell a huge difference right away. The shampoo rinsed out easier and my hair was so much softer when I dried it! It didn't feel ""crunchy"" LOL!Thanks Culligan, for a great product!"
1,Not worth it,This product has a defect. The metal piece that screws into the shower pipe is not stationary. The filter swivels around so the showerhead won't stay in place. I received a replacement filter and the same problem occurred. Water sprayed everywhere. I contacted Culligan direct and the CSR told me to remove the rubber seal inside the metal screw cap. I did that and water still sprayed everywhere and the filter continued swivel. I called back and the CSR said that anyone else who had the problem was able to remedy it by taking out the rubber seal. Now I have two worthless filters sitting in my garage. Good thing I was able to find the old model in a store in town. I'll be looking for a different brand filter.
1,Got two defective items in a row. Risky.,Same problem with the loose metal connector. Two items in a row. Culligan customer service has confirmed these are defects.
2,Not as good as the old shower filter,"The fault in this devise is where it attaches to the shower arm that comes out of the wall. You can only tighten this by hand , as per the directions, so the devise is able to pivot around the shower arm. Fortunately I was able to tighten it enough to stop it from leaking, but I couldn't stop it from pivoting. I have a hand held shower head that attaches to this devise and I had to fully tighten all if its adjustments to prevent them from pivoting too. Maybe if you have just a simple shower head attached to this filter it will work okay for you. I am disappointed because they discontinued the old Culligan shower filter and it did not have this tendency. I used it for many years and with many types of shower heads."
2,Filtering???,Easy enough to install but I have had the unit for 4 weeks and honestly can't tell the difference in my water when I shower.Skin dryness and hair have not improved and white scale and lime build up still occur on the shower head. Maybe my water isnot hard as I thought it was? I probably will not replace the filter when needed as I see no difference in my water.
4,It Works,"This thing really works. At least I think it works. Early on I used to lose lots of hair without using this filter. Now, it has receded a lot. I would say this is worth the money if you don't want to get bald. :)"
5,suprisingly great!!,"Its been 6 months since I installed this feature and I am happy to report a significant drop in dry skin! I have eczema and am prone to dry, flaky skin but I really haven't had any dry patches since I installed this filter. I live in So.Cal and I have no idea if my water is hard or not, but I do know my pipes are galvanized and old. No loss of water pressure either.Day to day, I couldn't tell if this filter worked but after thinking about my skin before I started using the filter, I realized that the results are subtle but great!!"
4,Less chlorine smell,"For the price its a great deal it reduced the chlorine a great deal but it is still there. I actually poured a glass of water from the shower then attached the filter ran it 10 minutes and filled up a second glass to compare.If I had to guess I'd say its an 80% reduction. I would love something better but there is no evidence that Sprite or Aquasana work any better. All 3 are only certified to remove chlorine and any other tests are so called independent laboratory tests that every filter company boasts about.If one does come out at 10,000 gallon capacity that removes flouride for less than $100 and can prove it then I can justify the cost to get that junk permanently out of my system."
5,Amazing Product,"This was the best $17.00 I've ever spent. Due to hard water issues, my hair had become dry and tangled, and I was constantly getting small rashes because my skin had lost all its moisture. I didn't know why, until a friend told me it was probably because of chlorine in my water. When I ordered the filter I was a bit skeptical. I'd been spending a lot of money on expensive conditioners and lotions with no results. Therefore, I didn't see how such an affordable product could make a difference. Well, it did. Immediately, my hair regained its luster and shine. My skin has become as soft as it was when I was sixteen. I don't even need lotion anymore. Highly recommended."
5,"Seems to work, good pressure",This doesn't reduce the pressure like I thought it would. I use this now to fill up the bathtub to avoid chemicals in the bath water. Well made.
5,great,works great and docent lose any pressure clean water from now on and it fits on allot of different shower heads
2,"I prefer carbon block, not KDF in this, for shower filter","Culligan's display packaging is deceptive. Instruction (5) says ""Flush the cartridge for 5 minutes to remove all carbon fines.""The cartridge WHR-140 included contains gold-color KDF like Sprite filters, not carbon.I like the DuPont shower filter (WSSS1050) cartridge WFSSC0501 much better. It uses a block of activated carbon with micron -sized pores which remove suspended solid impurities and chemicals better. My skin feels cleaner. Carbon block makes no sound when shaken. It is used by Brita, Pur, GE etc to produce drinking water, but KDF is not. KDF is mainly used to remove chlorine.The Culligan cartridge is filled with loose KDF. It sounds like sand when shaken. I do not notice any difference when taking shower with Culligan filter except for the lack of chlorine smell.Both Culligan and DuPont cartridges look exactly the same,same diameter, same hexagonal metal mesh, butdifferent filler. DuPont's is roughly 0.5 cm longer."
3,easy install but havn't noticed any difference yet,Filter is easy to install....we have been using it for a while now ..no complaints but we have really not noticed any difference in water filtration...three stars as not sure about if it is doing the job it is supposed to do...
4,Good addition to shower,"I am only a little disappointed that I had some trouble in attaching it to my handheld showerhead. It seems more unstable a connection than I had hoped for but other than that, I love it for its filtering quality. I needed a special way to filter my water since I have lymphoma and skin dryness from chemo."
3,Don't know if I notice any difference,"I don't know if I notice any difference in the water. We live in So Cal, so the water doesn't smell very chlorinated."
4,TDS unchanged,"Total dissolved solids reads the same straight from tap and through this filter (~300). However, the water no longer has hard water taste and appears to be kinder to my scalp."
5,Great decision!,"Living in the city, my skin and hair were constantly dry using tap water for showers. After my husband installed this (which was fast and easy), my skin feels much more comfortable during after showering. It was cheap and simple and I recommend this to anyone looking to improve shower water quality."
2,Not worth the money,Cheap plastic connector for shower head stripped with first hand attachment of shower head... had to throw it in the trash without even trying it once.
1,Start leaking after 2 weeks,Start leaking after 2 weeks and because i'm in different country im not going to send it back as it's cost more than what its worth.
4,Didn't help my hair,I have really hard water and brittle frizzy hair as a result. I was hoping this filter would help but it really hasn't.It was easy to install by hand and seems to have at least improved the dryness in my skin. Not quite what I was looking for but it's a high quality product. Apparently it just isn't filtering whatever is messing up my hair!
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,This is far and above the best best filtering system. Since we live in Texas I am sure our water is not tested by the EPA for safe chlorine amounts but before installing this head you would think you were bathing in a vat of chlorine afterwards no chorine smell at all. Under standard use it is recommended you replace the filter every 6 months but I think I will have to do it every 4 months. It is great and I highly recommend it.
1,Design flaws fatal to product,"No reason to explain what I needed this product for, that much, just given the product description, is obvious. The major fault is a construction/design flaw in the joint between the metal swivel that attaches to the shower pipe and the plastic assembly of the filter system. In short, it does not seal and cannot be tightened, thus sending spray in outward (ceiling, sides, etc.). If that would be adressed, this would be a decent product I could use. As it stands now, however, it is a $20 piece of trash."
2,"Filtered fine, but the contraption is badly constructed","Filtered okay, no chlorine noticeable in the shower. However, this is one chincy filter. Didn't fit the showerhead nipple well at all. A pile of teflon tape helped a little, but still leaked. Ultimately, the whole thing fell apart after about a year of use, due to daily repositioning of the head (two different people, two different angles). Cheap, cheap, cheap. Not recommended."
3,Great filter/Defective unit,This unit employs the same filter as Culligan WSH-C125 Wall-Mount. I can't rate the product bad as I received a defective unit. I had this particular filter in another unit and it made a difference. This model would tighten up on the shower arm but would not stay in one place. It would swivel 360 degrees and not stay in place. Amazon made the return very easy for me. Good for them.
2,Doesn't seem to do a lot for hard FL water,"I don't own a water softner, so I hoped that this would help in the shower. It doesn't do much. The water is still fairly hard and leaves residues as well as making my skin dry. Of course, we have awful water in Central Florida, and I am more sensitive to hard water than most. Still, the difference was barely measurable."
2,CHEAP PLASTIC,THE Culligan ISH-100 Level 2 Inline Shower Filter seem to work great but since the connection to the shower head is made of CHEAP PLASTIC it stripped on the first connection. Now if I need to change the filter cartridge I have to buy a whole new filter system.
4,Pretty good,"As soon as I started using this I noticed my hair was easier to brush after and my skin/hair wasn't as dry. It isn't the best, but I lived on well water most of my life haha. It lives up to it's expectations for the price!"
2,"Hard to get on, not comfortable.",These boots are hard to get on my son's foot. I have to help him and he has to angle his foot just right. (He's 5 1/2 yo) He complains they don't keep his feet warm and they're not comfortable. He's not a complainer so they must be pretty uncomfortable for him to even mention it. I bought a size larger (for extra socks etc) but the boots seem to run small. The larger size fit with no extra room.
4,Part four very useful,"I found part four ""Moving from one system to many"" quite useful and relevant in today's loosely-coupled distributed enterprise applications scenario. This book is a good read for those architects who are into product development."
4,Good Undergraduate Text,"I appreciated the authors' ""real world"" sense in their discussions. They don't get overly religious about a documentation style and they emphasize the need for a holistic approach to understanding architecture's impact on the application and the organization (e.g. work assignments, organizational view, risk assessment, ATAM as a communication tool etc).I particularly liked their presentation on the building blocks of an architecture as well as their discussion on tactics.My only criticism, and the students' as well, were the study cases. They threw too much at the reader about specific projects (some which were never completed). I think there should have been a better balance on the type of applications as well.I do plan on using this text again for my class next year."
2,Heavy in 'Case Studies' marginal on usable content.,"This text is chock full of ""Case Studies"" in Architectural design & development methods, but surpringinly sparse in specifics. The authors' take an approach that is almost entirely qualitative; I was hoping to see a more analytical set of methods for analysing architectures, but found little."
2,More theoretical,"Contrary to the title, I found the book more on the theoretical side. Lots of classifications with questionable practical value. The examples are high-level ending up with more classifications. Same observation about the simplistic figures.Chapter 13-The World Wide Web gives an introduction of the initial Web requirements, while Chapter 16-J2EE/EJB explains general ideas about EJB. My benchmark for an ""solid"" book, with somehow related topic, would be ""Design Patterns"" by Gamma,Helm,Johnson,Vlissides."
3,Music is more than just sound,"If music's merits were measured in atmosphere and texture alone, then To Rococo Rot would be considered one of the most innovative bands on the planet. The four members achieve a wonderfully cohesive sound that explores the space/density dichotomy with effortless grace. Unfortunately, as far as thematic development and melodic and harmonic complexity are concerned, ""Music Is A Hungry Ghost"" is decidedly primitive. So in time the locked grooves that establish such delicate interplay end up feeling more like incarceration than liberation, and what could have been warm and inviting sonic exploration begins to sound cold and aloof. More complex, enticing and listenable material is produced by the bands with which To Rococo Rot shares members - Kreidler and Tarwater."
4,Male Erotic Massage,A very good massage instruction manual. It will be a handy reference manual to keep.
5,How to massage man's body,"This book shows how to massage for any part of man's body, of course genitals. It is very easy to understand how to move my hand and fingers. Furthermore, this book has many sample pictures! I would like to make a massage for my partner."
4,pretty fun but a little on the cheap side,"bought these to play with, came right away and I have no problems with them other then they seemed a little poorly made but for the price they charged it was well worth it"
1,Broken,"Bummer. ..the glasses look like they would of been a really cool toy for my son, but the arrived broken."
2,Difficult to use,"Purchased this for a ""spy Kit"" for child and they are difficult to use and enormous for a child's head. They are made of materials that are not very sturdy."
3,"A little fun, not great","It's a cute little glasses that has a short span of fun time, no particular practical use of course. Had a little fun at first."
2,Disappointing!,"If you pay attention, the darker color at the edges is a mirror.The blue of the lenses fades with a touch, a fingerprint is left behind or a smudge in a shiny yellow or golden stain.Use only with great care never to touch the lenses from either side.They are also very small.If all this is good with you then by all means buy them, They're pretty cheap after all."
3,Great!,"Theese glasses are great! For a one time useage! I was so excited when the package came. But I only used it like 2 times. Sure it's a cool toy, & sure it's a cool thing to show off to your friends. But I regret getting those glasses. And I'm 11! I could get something better. So don't waste your money on this! But I do have to say that the shipping is fantastic! I came sooner than it said it would."
4,Fun item.,"I purchased two pair of these....one for my grandson to go along with ""spy"" themed gifts, and a pair that I will use myself for when I do trail walking. I am always suprised when I have someone approach from behind on a bike. These will give me some warning to move over."
5,I like them when bicycling in traffic,"Instead of attaching one of those geeky mirrors on your glasses and/or helmet, these cheap sunglasses are a pretty neat way to check back for traffic behind on either side. I also use them when I'm walking with my dog on a walk/bike trail. A lot of bicyclists don't bother to slow down or say something like ""passing on your left"" etc."
3,Arrived damaged but to late to reorder for Christmas gift.,These glasses were exciting to think about beforethey were received .Seeing things /people behind youwas going to be fun as a gift to a spy energizedboy but the wing broke off as it was taken fromthe package by me. I contacted the seller and hepromptly refunded my money.
3,you get what you pay for- but great concept,"When I opened the package to check these sunglasses, I was disappointed with the quality. There were already smudges on the lenses and one of the lens was chipped making it look pretty cheap.They do work though. I just wish they weren't chipped and that the finger prints were easier to get off.I'm only keeping them because it'll cost more to return than I paid for, but I did order a different pair from someone else. Hopefully those will look better.Also- the item is not as packaged. The item was packaged in a box that had the top corner ripped off of it. It did say something about it being spy gear though- had the box not been ripped, it wouldn't have been an issue."
2,They do work.,They work. Thats about the best thing about them. They are way to big for a kids head so they will fall off a lot. If your kids is not 7 or up don't even bother. Very square in the design so they look funny on. If I could do it again I would have paid for the Spy Gear Brand of these. Likely I will have to anyway cause these are cheap thin plastic. I'm sure they will suffer a fatal blow soon.
4,fun for 9 y.o. gift bag,"I bought these glasses for my daughter's 'spy' themed 9 year old birthday party. It was part of a 'spy kit' each girl got before they started their spy mission. Anyway, the girls loved the glasses! You can see behind you quite well. She still plays with them post-party, sneaking around and playing spy."
2,It makes my eye hurt,"I bought this for my 5 years old because he loved the spy gears. Since it's pretty cheap, so I gave it a try! My son played a little but isn't interested in it again. I tried this spy glasses on myself & I had to look on the sides in order to see things behind me. My eyes had to focus so closely and ""widely""...after wearing it for a short time, my eyes hurt!"
3,VERY Cheap plastic,"We ordered 4 pairs (so the whole family could have a pair) and 2 were broken when we opened their packages. Another broke while putting them on. The area where the ear piece connects to the front is VERY fragile. All 3 broken pairs broke at that connection point. I know they are very cheap, but even at this price, they are pretty fragile. Buy a pair, have fun, but be very careful with them."
2,Probably good for kids,I should have not bought it. It may be fun for kids. Gives you a little extra view but that you could get by moving your neck a little bit. I could not get the rear view (I do not have long hair or any other obstacle). It was cheap so no complaints but it is not for me.
4,Sneaky....very sneak,"Had a pair of these many years ago, wore them so much the inside mirrors finally wore off. Glad I could find them again, because they are great for keeping an eye on the kiddos in the back seat without them knowing."
1,broken,"it was only five bucks, so I'm not going to hassle with returning it or anything, but it was broken in the box when I opened it. The plastic hinge on each arm was busted. The box and package looked fine, so I assume they have a problem with their assembly twisting the hinge screw too tight or something? oh well."
1,Broken,Glasses came with ear piece broken! Might be able to super glue. Hopefully they will last a couple days after Christmas.
4,Good fun,"Kids (age 4-9) loved the sunglasses! We had a spy theme party, and the glasses were a hit!! I heard from a few moms after the party, that their kids (boys & girls alike) wrote about the party at school as well as took the glasses to school for share/show and tell. The glasses really work, and it's just a neat thing. I was also pleased with the construction of the glasses (pretty sturdy) and not made of the flimsy, cloudy cheap plastic you sometimes find on other kids' sunglasses...."
3,Cool! Really Works!,"I recieved these glasses as a gift and was amazed that when I put them on they actualy worked. It did take a lot to get to know how to use them but after, I was able to see anything behind me.Now your probably wondering, ""If I liked it so much why give it a 3?"" well although they work and you can see behind you it doesn't always mean you can see clearly. Because of the fact they're sunglasses when you look behind you it is kind of dark and also the idea of looking behind you is kind of dangerouse when you have to deside weather to look behind you or in front of you. I have gotten into about 10 accidents because of not looking in front of me. So, does work but, do not use when in motion!"
3,They do work,These glasses were the right size for my 9yo daughter. They were inexpensive and worth the price we paid. They work!
4,I liked them for the price,"you get what you pay for. Not the greatest quality but that was expected for the price. Perfect for little ""spys"" who love to play pretend games of spy."
4,Works as advertised,"Works as advertised and fun for the kids. My teenage son mentioned he would like some sunglasses that he can see behind him, so I found these and for the price picked up 4 sets for stocking stuffers. Not much to say about them other than the do let you see both forward and back!"
3,Weird but ok nothing to go CRAZY about though,Honest not sure what I was expecting but I kinda thing these are LAME. They really dont do what they say they do and I bought them as gag gifts for Christmas and wont be giving them out just to LAME and cheap looking. I thought these would be lots of fun for the guys and the kids and they are not that cool looking or anything though they shipped very quickly which I do appreciate.
2,Fun while it lasted,"Got this and had fun using it, i think the only problem i had with this product is that it is fragile. Wore it for 2 weeks straight and it broke. I think the main problem was not the toy itself but the fact that it is intended for children not adults. I am convinced that if it was for a child it would of lasted longer."
2,So this is the great Dust???,"I kept hearing about this band DUST and how cool they were and all that hype. So I coughed up my money only to find that the album LOOKS heavy but it sounds like a copy band trying to figure out Sabbath songs on acoustic guitars. Wow, I was greatly disappointed with this. Yeah it's got a couple of proto-metal moments like ""Learning to Die"", but man this was just a waste of my time. And everyone wonders why this band never took off?!? At least groups like Sir Lord Baltimore and even Granicus had promise..."
2,Edited Single Versions? .....skip it!,"If your a listener who has not exerienced the long versions of these great songs, your in for a extreme treat! Unfortunately, your not going to experience them here...so skip this and track down the extended versions....they are WELL worth the lookup!"
4,Good ... But ...,"This is a good sampling of Rare Earth but some of the electricity is missing here. It can only be found on ""Rare Earth In Concert"" which was a double LP put out in the '70's by Motown. This is one of the finest , energetic live albums ever put out - the fact that it includes the 23 minute version of ""Get Ready"" is a bonus ! ... Whatever happened to this on CD ? Can anybody out there let us Rare Earth fans know where a copy can be found ? Seems Motown missed the boat on this one ... In the meantime , this collection is as good as you are going to find."
3,Solid dance rock,"What a throwback. Growing up in middle school with Rare Earth was kewl, considering the other rockbands were just to heavy to dance too. ''Celebrate'' and their remake of ''I'm Losing You,'' fit the times - long solos, psychedelic atmospherics, and solid drumming."
3,Fine disc for dance practice,"Nothing wrong with this disc. I was looking for all East Coast Swing to practice dancing. A better disc (but you have to like old R&B) is ""Everybody Dances Swing - series #1."" Amazon couldn't find it (I waited about 8 weeks) so I got a perfect condition used copy from one of their partners within about 3 days."
2,Strictly Swing and Jive,"This CD is not what I expected. I thought it is one with fast pace swing dance music. Well, for those of you out there who wanted to get a CD, you need to try playing it first before placing an order."
1,This game sucks!!,"I grew up in the 80s and love the music of those years, however unless you are from the UK or Australia you will not do well with this game. It repeats itself several times and has obscure groups such as Ultravox and Wa Wa Nee as answers...I swear Midge Ure has some of royalty ties to this game! If you don't know who he is don't buy this game."
1,never received any of my products,hi.I have not gotten any of my products i purchased. IO should have gotten it already but have yet to. please email me so i can figure out why it hasnt come yet.
4,very satisfied with my purchase,"I am very pleased with the bowling book. I am a beginner. The book has instructions I can understand, each week I focus on one tip in the book and my bowling has improved. Last year I took a 10 week beginner class (group lessons), many of the instructions in the book duplicated the beginner class. The benefit of the book is that it reminded me what I learned in class."
4,Good guide for the beginner,"My wife and I have taken up bowling. This was a good book for both of us. It refined my technique, improving my score significantly. Wife has also picked up her score too. I would definitely recommend this for the beginner and intermediate bowler."
4,fundamentals good.,"I thought the writer did an excellent job explaining the basics needed for bowling well. The book walked you through equipment, lane set up, targeting, body mechanics, and mindset. It did come up short however, on advance skills and techniques, but a great starting point non-the-less."
5,bowling fundamentals,this book is excellent it gives detailed info about the approach to the foul line something i have been having trouble with
5,Great book for beginners and to renew basics.,I haven't even read all of this book yet but have gotten so many helpful hints for bowling. It is excellent for beginners and great for brushing up on what you may be doing wrong as a beginner and intermediate bowler.I like the illustrations;I find they show how to correct mistakes and bowl the right way. It gives instructions of how to practice the ideas at home without a bowling ball.
5,velour changing pad,I was very happy with this product. It helps so that it's not a cold surface to lay the baby on. Cleans very easily!
4,an interesting experiment,Burning Bright is probably the most experimental of Steinbecks novels. He has four character and he tells their stories in three radically different scenarios as circus workers a farmer and his helpers and a seaman and his small crew. The characters are a 50 year old man his best friend his much younger wife and a young man. I wont detail what happens but it is well done The book has only four chapters only 143 pages of actual text. The first two chapters are too long and this keeps the book from 5 stars but it is still very good. One of his most obscure novels but one worth reading
4,a down-home Louisiana boy makes good as a pitcher,"A really simple, easy-to-read account of Ron Guidry's rise from Louisiana to a star pitcher for the New York Yankees. It even has some terriffic Cajun recipes as prepared by Ron's mother, grandmother, & mother-in-law."
3,SIMPLE READ,"THIS IS THE STORY OF FORMER YANKEE RON GUIDRY. BETTER KNOWN AS LOUISIANA LIGHTNING, RON DOES A NICE JOB TELLING HIS STORY. THIS IS BOOK IS VERY SIMPLE AND EASY TO READ. TOO BAD HE DIDN'T SPEND MORE TIME ON HIS CAREER INSTEAD OF ON HIS FAMILY AND HUNTING. I ENJOYED HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS BROTHER WHO IS HANDICAPPED, THE MOST. RON SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD GUY WHO IS DOWN TO EARTH AND LIVES THE SIMPLE LIFE. I SEE RECENTLY HE WAS NAMED TO THE YANKEE PITCHING COACH, CONTINUED SUCCESS TO MR GUIDRY."
4,DVD may be faulty but replacement available from DreamWorks,"The GITS2 DVD may be faulty in having a Closed Caption subtitle (in BIG font I might add) instead of a regular subtitle. In case this GITS2/Millennium Actress 2-pack doesn't have the corrected DVD, you can have it replaced free of charge by Dreamworks by going to gofishpictures.com/GITS2 and fill in a web form to request for a mailer. Don't let this stop you from buying this 2-pack at such a good price.Faulty DVD has the ""D191757V2"" encoding in the inner ring of the disc, while the corrected DVD says ""D19175757V4""."
3,This is not an english version,"The film itself is a 5 star production. If you don't mind subtitles, this movie is great. The GITS world is amazing and the visual effects are spectacular. I didn't have a problem with the subtitles because of the extra caption-like features but I did have a problem since this is not an English dubbed verson as the Product Features indicate."
1,A question for those who have bought this....,"Everyone,Does this version of Ghost in the shell 2 have the English voices dubbed in? Or is this still the Japanese only version? I can deal with the ""closed caption subtitle problem"",........what I can't deal with is no English voices and having to read 100 minutes of dialogue.Someone please let me know....."
1,Don't waste your time,"This novel is just another one of those 90s works written by people more or less ""gay subculture oriented"" (as Bruce Bawer would call it) which are not really worth the paper they got printed on. The silly plot consists of the usual mix of weird things (gay bars and their strange patrons, silly ideas about homosexuality and lots of sex and psychological problems) that can be very dangerous for a young man/teen who happens to be gay and possibly reads a book like this to get some answers. I've wasted my time when I was about 17 reading this book, don't repeat my mistake!"
4,Handy for in your pocket,"This is a great version of the NSRV to carry in your pocket or purse. It is narrow enough to fit in to a man's coat pocket but not so thick that it can't slide into a purse. I've carried mine for over 2 years and the leather softcover looks like new! The print is tiny but I guess that is inherant to a large book being but into such a small format. I do appreciate that this translation of the Biblical text used the original Hebrew/Greek, ect. writings instead of someone else's translations."
1,No suction,"I have used this steam vac about 9-10 times and it SUCKS, or should I say it does not suck since it the suction stopped working right after it soaked my carpet. I'm thoroughly digusted. Into the trash it goes. Do not buy this product."
1,Beware!,"I had a Hoover steam vac for eight years and loved it, I used it frequently and wore it out. I replaced it with this one two years ago. I didn't use it as often and it didn't work as well. I have already replaced the tank on it once and it leaks again. I went to use it tonight and the motor smells like it is burning up. From the first day I used it, I noticed the parts are flimsy on it and suction is poor. I never thought I would consider a Bissell but Hoover's standards have gone down. It would cost too much to replace the motor and the tank--which will probably leak again. I recommended the first machine to my mother, three friends, and a couple in the store looking at them. Everyone I know was happy with that machine. Sadly, I would strongly advise against buying this one."
3,"Good Cleaner, but some design flaws.","I have given this machine 3 stars, because when it is working well, it is one of the best home extractor units out there! The machine has nice features, like the rinse feature. You can just rinse the carpets without shampoo. The parts that I see break frequently are the Shampoo tank itself, and the part the tank connects to on the base of the machine. I can't even tell you how many shampoo tanks we have sold for this machine. It is designed in a way that the normal consumer will break 6-10. Be carefull when reattaching the shampoo tank after refilling with water/shampoo."
1,Leaking tank,"My machine is 13 months old and has done 9 rooms of carpet cleaning in two sessions. The clean water tank (top) leaked a little my last use. With this most recent attempt, the tank leaked profusely. Upon inspection, the opening that supports the clean water valve was cracked and extremely friable so that the plastic around the rubber gasket just broke apart with any attempt to examine under the rubber lip. Hoover customer service said the tank has been redesigned (I'll assume they recognized the flaw) but they are unwilling to replace the defective one. The tank replacement is $40 and has no warranty. When not leaking, the machine did a very good job but I will go back to Bissell."
1,Bad quality,"I would not even give it one star, very poor quality of materialDidnt use it more than two times"
3,"""Boot Camp"" (2007)","plot outline:Packed off to Camp Serenity on a remote Fiji isle, teenage rebel Spohie and a host of other troubled kids soon find themselves brutalized by the sadistic Dr. Norman Hail and his staff.Electronic ankle cuffs and the surrounding ocean make excape impossible...until Sophie's boyfriend, who's back in the States, gets involved."
2,I wanted the 2 hours of my life back,"I bought this movie because Gregory Smith is such a phenomenal actor, but I was deeply disappointed with it. The movie itself was very frustrating and slow-going. The premises just seemed nonsensical: a troubled girl who's lazy parents have given up trying to discipline her so they send her to some remote boot camp and her boyfriend somehow gets himself sent to the same camp to try to rescue her (yeah right).While I realize this film was most likely meant to put into light the crappy treatment that people receive at boot camps like this, the film just seemed to be lacking any real depth. I'm not sure if it was just poor writing or just too many characters and craziness going on.In the end, I paid a steep price for a film with little substance, absolutely NO extras on the entire DVD, and I felt mostly like I just wanted the 2 hours of my life back I spent on it."
2,Ok movie,I expected more from this movie with Mila Kunis being in it and with the good plot it had but didn't seem to deliver want it should have.
4,"""Boot Camp"" with Mila Kunis, Gregory Smith & Peter Stormare",This Film is a bit frightening in that it is possible that something like this type of adolescent imprisonment may actually exist.The ending in this film was poetic justice. The film seller was exceptional to deal with.
1,Disappointing,"Heavy duty, yes!Great color, yes!But the water distribution is poor, only the outer 1/3rd of the pattern gets water, the inner portion close to the sprinkler remains bone dry.I put it out with a ""take me i am free"" sign.Don't waste your money."
2,a disappointment,"The most I've spent for a sprinkler. Just because it said Dramm. I thought it might actually work, but it is rather pitiful. It does not cover anywhere near the area advertised unless, perhaps, attached to a fire-hose. Our water pressure isn't bad, I can cover half my yard with my old $7 sprinkler but with this thing, I'm lucky to reach 1/4. Very sad."
1,Pricing Problem,"After ordering from Amazon at $23.01, found same item in my local hardware store for $19.99. Local store doesn't have discount pricing and normally is higher priced than big box hardware stores. First time I'm aware of that I've been burned on pricing for an Amazon purchase. Just a warning to check local pricing."
1,"Great idea, so-so execution","We have a smallish yard in San Francisco - rectangular. We are trying to minimize the amount of wasted water.This product seemed to be the perfect solution, but it doesn't work quite as well as it should:1. There are stronger areas and weaker areas - so, if you're using the square, there might be one side of the square where the water goes further than the other side. Thus, not quite a square.2. Missing a couple of shapes - as noted by the other reviewer.Really wanted this to work. It's a great idea, just doesn't quite do the job."
3,Like this,This sprinkler works very well. Only problem is that the diagram of the coverage choices isn't really helpful. The pictures don't look like what's on the sprinkler itself.
1,same movie by a different title,This is the same movie with a different title ---- the previous one was billed as a zombie flick. tortured or some such.
3,I just wish ppl would let me order shit and leave me alone. I do NOT want to rate EVERTYTHING I orderr on line!!!!,I just wish ppl would let me order shit and leave me alone. I do NOT want to rate EVERTYTHING I orderr on line!!!!
1,A piece of rubbish,I dropped three feet onto a carpeted floor and its top came off and the spring exploded. A total loss. Do not buy this.
1,This book is worthless!,"This book is so full of errors and mistakes that it ends up being more of a waste of time than anything else. In addition, the writing style is amateurish - almost to the point of being funny. You get the impression that the author was simply transcribing Sky&Telescope rather than thinking through what she was actually trying to say."
5,Wonderful!,"I was lucky enough to find a nice copy of the paperback original recently and highly recommend this story to anyone who may have yet to read it. If you can find it reprinted in another edition then go for that, too. Ellison is a wonderful, biting writer, one who long-ago defined cutting-edge, and deserves an extremely wide readership.Highly recommended!"
2,Remakes of CDB classics.,"Great titles but I was disappointed that they were remakes. Not bad, but as a 25 year CDB fan, I like the origional recordings or live recordings Much better."
5,Awesome record!,"I hunted everywhere to find a recording of Charlie Daniels playing the Orange Blossom Special. And boy, is this ever amazing! If you buy it just for that one song, then you've done well! Amazingly so. You know it's amazing when it just makes you cry to realize how gifted some people are and well, I personally think that Mr. Daniels is the best violinist/fiddle player alive today. Across all boundaries, nationalites, you name it. The rest of the record is just amazing too - you wouldn't believe how kids love this CD, especially kids in orchestra class. They just sit there with their mouths open! Awesome, best recording ever. Thank you SO much Mr. Daniels for sharing your talent with us. What a God-given gift!"
4,The best way to discover a fantastic band and it unique music,Very amazing compilation for a special band that play southern and country rock music from a lot of time. This disc is specially suggested to ones who don't know the Charlie Daniels Band and want to discover it and his music. The very good quality of the recordings let the listener to better appreciate the all tracks.
5,Delightful,"After watching the movies, I finally started reading the novels. This first one was quite entertaining. I am liking forward to the rest."
4,A Worthy Hero for All Ages,"At first, I avoided the Harry Potter series. I figured that the childrens novels would be far too juvenile for me. However, my perspective changed when my father, a 59 year old, sang their praises. I was convinced and Harry was going to get a try.My first attempt at reading the book failed as I was going to college and the fairly long begining of the book in which Harry lives with his less than friendly relatives, the Dursleys, kept me from buying a copy to bring with me. Frankly, the Dursleys are the weakest point in the series and are what kept me from giving Harry's first adventure a five star rating.That aside, Harry is a role model and his adventure shows kids the importance of true virtues even though we all break the rules occasionally. Excellent Reading!"
3,Not bad,"To be honest, I didn't think this book was all that wonderful. I feel kind of left out because I don't see what all the fuss is about. It has some memorable characters, particularly Hagrid, but some of the others seemed kind of bland, even in a world of magic. The parts with the Dursleys were funny, but the rest of it lacked the same level of humor. Rowling has been very inventive in creating this world, but so have a lot of other authors."
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,Good book.Exciting Mysterious and want to keep reading.If love wizards and fantasy this is a good book to read or the best.
5,Great beginning!,"I love the Harry potter series, great beginning, recommend highly!'re-reading the series makes the books more understandable and you have more ""ah-ha"" moments.."
5,Great add on !!!,This is a great for adding on cymbals when you don't have the space for more full sized stands. I would definately recommend for tight spaces.
5,Perfect,"Easystar is very durable and repairable. But if your upgrading motor and esc easier to just order the fuselage and start from scratch,"
2,battery dead.,"I got it and the batteries where dead, even thought it was supossed to be activated first. We had to take it to the store and pay additionnal money."
3,4th Edition different from 5th,"If you are needing the 5th Edition for a class, Do not be fooled that the 4th is the exact same. The majority of the documents are exactly the same but a few key ones are not there. It depends if you want to do the extra work to save a few dollars...so far it's been ok for me..."
1,No Pictures in the Kindle Edition,"I love kindle books, but this book does not show any of the pictures that are in the paperback. There is only a picture description and a disclaimer saying that the pictures are not displayed in the kindle edition. This is horrible. The publisher should be ashamed to sell a crippled version of the book without a disclaimer. Amazon should not sell crippled version of books without everything, pictures and other features included in the kindle edition."
2,Don't buy the Kindle edition!,"As a Kindle user, I am feeling quite cheated by Amazon.com, because the Kindle edition of this book does not include the pictures that were obviously part of it..AND Amazon did not say, when I was ordering it, that this would be the case. I am thinking about trying to get my money back. SO....don't order it on Kindle! You'll read, time and again, that there would have been a picture in such-and-such a place if you'd purchased the paperback."
2,It was not made clear that the video format was on a cassette,"When I received this video, I was disappointed that the video was on a cassette and not in DVD format. The video content is great but cassette format is outdated. It was not made clear that the video format is on a cassette."
2,Nice But Not Really An Aquarium,"This is a nice dvd but it is more like a camera in the ocean.It is not like a tropical ""AQUARIUM"" as I was expecting.It also has many sections but I have not found a way to have just ONE section play and loop. It keeps changing and just looks like I have a Discovery Channel on, instead of an aquarium of fish....pity."
1,dull and boring,This video was drab and not colorful at all. It was a disappointment. This is seven more words in review
3,HDscape (Underwater),"This is not underwater photography in the sea. The aquarium discs are often repetitious with a limited variety of sea life. The best disc of this type I have seen is ""SeaVisions."""
2,Yikes!! Singing is way out of tune!,"The singing is terrible on ""Fly Me To The Moon"". Don't take my word for it. Listen to the free sample supplied by Amazon.com . At 16 seconds into it, when she sings ""all I worship and adore"", she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes! Even someone with no musical training can hear it.The rest of the pieces sound fine."
3,"Good, but too little memory","I have had 7 iPAQs with this one. All of them had 64mb ram. What i was thinking when i bought this one... a lot of software does not works with only 32 mb of ram. Forget about playing games, this unit only has 10 mb free after a reset, and all good games needs 20 mb. Buy a Dell Axim instead."
1,NO CODE! BEWARE!!!!,"The seller first sent me the purse with NOTHING on it - looks used. Had bought the new one right from this page along with a TON of other stuff that all came fine. They resent at no charge another pink purse, this time with the front paper tag -- but AGAIN - NO C O D E !! So be very careful about this product!"
4,little girls purse,"Little girls love purses. This one has her favorite color...pink...and green, and is a novelty with a bear face. She loves it and carries it everywhere. It's a good deal for me. Seller very courteous and a very, fassst shipper."
1,Could be better...,"The instructions for this item (as well as Customer Service) say that you can use this drive with Win98 First Edition if you download the correct driver from their website.They *don't* tell you that under Win 98, the driver will *still* give an error message saying that you have the wrong operating system. Customer service says that to open a file in Win 98, you need to right click the drive in ""My Computer"" and click ""open"" in the pop-up menu (because double clicking on this drive in ""My computer"" causes an error in Win98.)Furthermore, the password protection is NOT availabe to you under Win 98.I questionned customer service on these things and they said that this is just the way the drive operates in Win 98.I don't know how it operates in Win XP, but take their claims that it works with Win 98, First Edition with a very, very large grain of salt (don't let that grain of salt drop on your foot, you might hurt yourself.)"
1,Can't handle normal use - for three months,"Despite the earlier review that states a Jump Drive survived a trip to the washing machine, apparently normal everyday use is too much for it to handle. I purchased this product in December and it has failed already. While I understand that drives sometimes fail, one would expect a product to last more than a few months. To me this speaks to a distinct lack of quality. Coupled with the fact that admin rights are required to use the secure section of the drive partition (potentially limiting use), this product has done nothing to warrant my repeat business. I will be searching for a new USB drive. One more note - the larger (read: awkward) size of this thing also makes it nearly impossible to use it near any other occupied USB port). I have a Kingston drive and (with crossed fingers) I hope that it lasts longer than 90 days."
2,Diagnosis: Inconclusive,"This book turned out to be of little use to me. I took the 50 question quiz and when I scored it, it turned out that I was almost evenly divided among the 3 categories. Garcia doesn't even address this possibility and what it might mean. I doubt that everyone who takes the quiz falls neatly and decisively into one of the three categories. I think it would have been better if the questions were weighted as to their importance in determining what kind of ""burner"" you are."
1,A Crashing Disappointment,"For many people trying to lose a few pounds, this book appears to be the ultimate solution - what a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! The health/nutritional information offers nothing new, the questionaire is ridiculous and the diet suggestions require you to remember vast amounts of information as to what you can and can't eat. If you can afford to give up your day job in order to apply yourself to this diet, or of you have a chef in residence at your home, then go for it. But, if the questionaire indicates you are a mixed burner - then use the book as a door stop as it has no other use. For a no-nonsense approach to food choices, I strongly recommend Picture Perfect Weight Loss by Dr. Shapiro."
4,Layperson's guide to metabolism and nutrition,Well explained nutrition and physiology information. Much of the book confirms other researchers' (eg. Charlton Fredericks) work regarding different metabolisms and how people with fast or slow burning metabolisms need to adjust their eating habits. Oz also explains how stress ruins many people's health. Some of my personal training clients have gotten good results from following Mr. Garcia's advice.Doug SetterBachelor of Human EcologyAuthor of Stomach Flattening
2,Too general for people informed on nutrition / healthcare,"I was drawn to this idea of customizing your diet / health plan to your own body / metabolism - really seemed to be the latest, most commonsense-like phase however the test most likely puts people into the ""mixed"" group and if one is reasonably current on healthcare / nutrition you probably won't get much from this book."
1,So many UNTRUTHS!!,"During my reading of this book I found myself saying over and over again, ""What? That DID NOT happen"". Also many names were misused and also wrong. I expected MUCH more from Dot Moore. She claims to be such an expert. WHAT HAPPENED DOT?I can honestly stand behind my review, for I am related to Mrs. Evie Mitchell. My aunt Evie is actually quoted in this book saying things THAT WERE NEVER SAID.OH DOT MOORE---SHAME ON YOU!!!!"
4,Storytelling extraordinaire,"I read Dot Moore's book purely on a whim, since Dot Moore is a local writer where I live. The only contact that I have ever head with Heard County, Georgia, is passing through on I-85 going to Atlanta. What I found were a hell of a lot of good stories. Whether they were true ot not seemed irrelevant, because they were told via hearsay and who-said-what. This woman seemed so enigmatic and even told lies about herself. For fans of hoodoo folklore and mysteries of the old South, this one is a good read. For folks looking for ""just the facts,"" it might not be so good because no one, not even the people interviewed, seemed to be terribly sure what was and wasn't true about this woman, but that was the reason she is still talked about today."
1,Not great and expensive,"I didn't enjoy the video at all. The narration is very boring with a speaker who speaks slowly and irritatingly punctuating his sentences with an overload of er's (e.g. This low, er... tables are actually, er... desks. And the, er... round, er... item there is, er...). Some parts are narrated by native Japanese tour guides giving a typical tour-guide description of the attactions which to me are not good enough for a documentary video. Quite a large part of the attractions were also filmed in the middle of rain, so it was rather gloomy to look at. Overall, very unexciting."
5,"Ask yourself, what do you want to do?","Why haul around a Palm or Windows CE device when you only want to check your calendar and look up phone numbers? The Rex Pro fits in a shirt pocket, syncs well with the calendar provided in the software (TrueSync Desktop) and with anything else you want to link to, like Yahoo calendar. Granted, the entry of new data is a bit cumbersome, but you can do most of this on the desktop or notebook calendar. Now that the device syncs both ways, I find it invaluable."
5,Timesaver... best weight workout on market!,"I highly disagree with the 1-star rater. Regarding her points first, it moves quickly because the strength training is done using a technique called supersetting. You push yourself and then move quickly in between exercises to move to the next exercise. I found her cheering of ""four more"" highly encouraging.I myself, am an aerobics instructor. This video is challenging but appropriate for anyone. You choose your level of weights and you can set it down when it gets to be too much. The exercises move quickly so you won't sit around feeling left out if you choose not to do 6 or 7 reps. You'll get right back into it! I love this video. I was dying to find a way to increase my strength training, and this is it! I even have my boyfriend who is a PE teacher do the arms with me and he loves it. There are men on the video and women and I like that. Kathy looks awesome by the way. This is the best video I've done out of the many I own!"
3,I thought it was really boring and confusing.,I think that the movie was confusing and I did not like it. Hercules should not have fallen in love with Xeana after she tried to kill him and his friend . But he was not thinking staight like he should have.
1,The Worst Ever,This is the absolute worst movie ever produced about MC riding. Don't waste your money. The only movie that was worse was the 1970's flick of 3 guys riding to Mexico.
2,"Good Photos, about it.","This was an interesting book to view, as the photographs were excellent, and the record weights of past pumpkins was quite indepth (half the book). However, if you are looking for a book that will give you lots of good information on how to grow giant pumpkins, this is probably not the book. What little information that was actually shared can easily be found on the internet. I would suggest contacting your local Cooperative Extension office for some real science based information. Otherwise, this book will provide you some inspiration with all the large pumpkin photos."
3,"Diorio, un excellent guitariste!","Cette hommage à Wes Montgomery est une découverte! Il faut écouter cet album, Diorio possède un jeu de guitare impressionnant. Ses solos me touche toujours beaucoup. Il a bien rendu hommage au très grand du jazz, qu'est Montgomery. Je recommande cet album à tout les amateurs de jazz..."
3,PDA Leather Pouch,"The product was of good quality, but it was rather snug for my XV6700 Audiovox PDA. Each time I would pull my phone out of the pouch, the battery backing would come off. I haven't used the leather pouch much since."
2,The $43.20 amazing PINKY HI-Bounce,"I find it hard to believe that everyone don't give this product a high rating. A toy ball with a list price of $43.20 must be one hell of a ball. I was thinking of buying this for my dogs to play but after what I have read, I think I will just pass on this excellent deal."
2,"Not as pictured - ""High Bounce PInky"" Made in China rec'd","The Pinky Balls I received were not the same product pictured. They seem to be a knock-off of the real Pinky Ball. The printing says ""HIGH BOUNCE PINKY"" with ""Made in China"" directly below the name. They are not as firm as the real Pinky Ball, so if you're looking for a less firm massage ball, here's your ball. Unfortunately, I was looking for the firm version.Update - If you're looking for a massage ball (or just a nice bouncy ball) try mini lacrosse balls."
4,Bouncy,"My daughter asked for this as a replacement for the one we lost. It is a fun little ball. The first one we had came in a nice box but this one just came in plastic. It had some marks on it but, since it was going to be bouncing around anyway, I just kept it."
2,Just a rubber ball,"There is nothing ""hi-bounce"" about it. I thought it may have been a super ball. Those things came out about 40 years ago, and they really did have a high bounce. That was a cool ball. This.......just a rubber ball. Nothing more."
5,True account of an uncommon adventure,"""Distant Fires"" was published in 1990 and is the true account of a summer canoe trip from Duluth Minnesota to Hudson Bay Canada by two men in their early 20's. More than anything else, this book speaks to the modern charisma and abilities of the author, who planned and accomplished the journey, then, wrote such a wonderful and humorous account of it. Chapter by chapter, the reader is taken to the water, along the route, and into the perspective of the adventure. This book is testomony to what's in the future and beyond the horizon. It cannot be over-recommended for young and old. Thank you Scott Anderson for sharing your uncommon knowledge and insight of ""Distant Fires"" on earth and in our lives."
3,Distant Fires Interesting Read,"Interested in wilderness experiences and especially the North. Good read so far. Great sense of humor. I can feel the bugs and the ""getting lost"" frustration. Good complement to ""Canoeing with the Cree""."
2,A little disappointing,"I was a bit disappointed with the presentation of this book. I liked the spiral-bound design, but the pages are printed on paper similar to xerox stock. They could've laminated the pages or at least used card stock. I am afraid that the book will be ruined after a few uses. The recipes are ok, however, I would've liked to see more dairy-free recipes. Many of the recipes use soy milk or soy cheese as a substitute which you could do with any recipe. I didn't need a special book to tell me that."
2,Too small for the price,"I just got that book yesterday. When my husband got the book out the box I thought ""they gotta be kiddin'"". $ 12.50 for a small book like that is ridiculus. I guess some people think they can do that with people like me that are desperate with finding recipes that suit their disease. I haven't tried the recipes so I can't say anything about that. But I guess as in pretty much all cookbooks for colits that I read so far everybody has to adjust the recipes so they won't cause too much trouble. For example onions, garlic, corn, lettuce and spinach give me trouble sometimes. Especially during a flare-up like I have at the moment."
2,ok,The recepies were not geared towards a diet good for ulcerative colitis. It was more like a regular cook book.
2,Not very impressive...,"This book (or group of index cards) is a plentiful list of recipes, but nothing to be excited about. It looks as though some typed-up a bunch of index cards and stood at the corner copier for ten minutes."
1,"satisfaction gauranteed 5 stars, disreguard above scale","reluctantly bought this set a few months ago used, and I havent stopped listening since. the atlantic studios disc is my favorite, perfect acoustics, crowd , set, etc. The paris stuff is great too ,but the larger arena yields a slightly lesser sound quality. disc 4 is like a cool new studio album with altered favorites and some good origionals. Some people didnt understand why back in black was included here (myself included), but listen to it again and you'll realize its a bon scott album being sung by another person.Bon scott will always be my favorite singer/showman of all time. Unlike most whiny mansion living , hummer driving , rehab , modern rock stars , bon lived pretty much ghetto til the day he died, (much longer than he should have). Always grinning, never complaining, giving it all he had."
5,A LOVING TRIBUTE TO BON SCOTT,"""Bonfire"" is a definite must for any fan of AC/DC. Everything here is superb, and really does Bon Scott justice. My favorites from this box set are the CD's ""Live at Atlantic Studios"" and ""Volts"", which has ""Dirty Eyes"", and a great live version of ""Sin City"". The book that comes with this box is well done, with lots of great pictures and quotes from the band. AWESOME!! Overall, this box set is a great package, and well worth the money. Bon Scott, RIDE ON!!!"
5,My first love...?,"Angus! But this set is all about Bon, of course, who's been highly underrated as a singer throughout the years. This is an excellent collection any AC/DC fan will enjoy...'nuff said. But for those of you wondering why Back in Black was included...have you ever actually listened to it? Recorded in only 5 short months after Bon's death, it stands as a tribute to him. You don't even need to listen past the first track to pick that up. Perhaps you should stop worrying about people already owning Back in Black and look at the set as what the band intended it to be...A TRIBUTE TO BON SCOTT."
3,Only if you're hardcore,"This 5-cd box set tribute to the deceased Bon Scott features 3 live discs and 1 disc of outtakes from the Bon Scott era, and, for some reason, a remastered version of Back in Black, apparently because that album was the original tribute to Bon. Good stuff for hardcore AC/DC fans, but too expensive for anyone else to bother with."
2,Unconscionable Overkill,"Was this trip absolutely necessary? What was the point of compiling a box set two fifths of which are albums which have never gone out of print? Had they kept it to the unearthed concert material featuring ill-fated, self-destructive lead singer Bon Scott, they MIGHT have had a box worthy of their reputation. But unless you're an AC/DC completist, you don't want to pay for what you've probably already got, since the albums in question - the live ""If You Want Blood...You've Got It"" and, of course, the masterwork produced in Scott's memory, ""Back In Black"" - are selling as well in their current remastered editions as when they were first issued."
2,CAN'T SEE THE DVD ON MY TV !!!,"Thanks for exchanging my 'original' purchase of BONFIRE. Unfortunately the replacement CD/DVD gave me the same results. I could not watch the DVD. I got the audio, but nothing on the screen. I thought this might be a 'Blue-Ray' but have my doubts. Why can't I put in the DVD's and watch them.....like renting a movie from Red Box? I'm extremely upset that I can't watch the DVD's, as this was the main reason for my purchase. I have tried formatting the DVD player on every concievable configuration. . . no luck. I tried two different DVD players and even my laptop computer.......... NO LUCK. If you can't watch them, why sell them? Unfortunately, I can't recommend this BONFIRE DVD/CD set, as it doesn't work."
3,THE BREEZE is a retard..check the spelling...check the ears,THE BREEZE is something I wipe after going to the bathroom..Give this loser no credit...hell..he can't even spell!Another kid skipping school.huffing paint...I suppose..:{Alot of bucks...but if you like real DC with Bon buy it!Bon and Angus are ACDC...Bon drank himself to deathEnjoy what they had...I'm sure Angus misses Bon...
3,AC/DC Bonfire,"The music is great but one of the cd's is a little scratched up, and one of the cases looks pretty worn. It was labled as ""like new"". I would not consider this ""like new"". I was a little disappointed"
3,Bon Scott fans will enjoy this cd,"What you will be getting from this 5 cd package is:cd 1. basically a fair to good bootleg from a radio show featuring BONcd 2. Outtakes from recordings, songs from TV shows and songs not released on Non-Australian recordings with BON (but not all of them, according to other reviewers),which don't sound half badcd 3/4. The audio version of the movie ""let their be rock"", without the interview segments, from the Highway to Hell tour that sounds very goodcd 5. the Back in Black cd.Thus if you are a Bon Scott fan you won't be disappointed with this 5 cd box set.If you are a casual AC/DC listener or someone who is not head over heals over the work Bon did with AC/DC, then I suggest you spend your money elsewhere on other AC/DC recordings.If there were 10 stars given, it would have to be only a 6/10 because I have heard better sounding bootlegs with Bon Scott on them; AC/DC fans probably have Back in Black cd and the Movie ""Let there be Rock""."
5,Good all-round collection of this brilliant band,"This set of Cds is extremely entertaining and is a great audio history of AC/DC. This is a collection of some of their greatest and most popular songs, as well as some good old favourites. If you like this band, you will love this box set. Buy it now."
3,If you keep your expectations reasonable...,"...you'll be reasonably satisfied with this CD. The ""Strictly..."" series of CDs is made for ballroom dancing, and taken as simply an aid for dance, it accomplishes its purpose. The music is monotonous, unvaried and the instrumentation is the same throughout. HOWEVER, I can dance/practice a ballroom-style tango to this music. It serves that purpose very well. If you're looking for high musical value in this series, you're probably better off making a compilation CD of your own favorite music or actually spending a little more money for a CD out of the ""Strictly ballroom"" series."
1,"If I could rate this zero, I would...","First of all, how could they use ""My Girl"" in one of their songs? David Ruffin must be rolling over in his grave! Otis Williams needs to take a long look in the mirror and remember ""what goes around, comes around""and think about how he treated David Ruffin."
1,"it wasn't what I expected, it didn't move me","I expected more from the Temptations, I played the CD several times and nothing, sorry I didn't like it. I didn't like the music and most of the lyrics did not match the music."
2,Very weak,"This cd contains two songs that are worth playing. There is ""one"" voice that let's you know it's the Tempts and that's Ron Tyson. If he were gone, you would never know it's the Tempts. Sorry.."
2,Not very good,"I give the Tempts all the credit in the world for their legacy; however, this is not a good cd and it's not worth buying."
3,Weak,"This cd contains two songs that are worth playing. There is ""one"" voice that let's you know it's the Tempts and that's Ron Tyson. If he were gone, you would never know it's the Tempts. Sorry.."
4,"Harmonies are excellent, ballads are great","After the Temp's last C.D., ""For Lover's Only"", I was hype when this new C.D. dropped. The first release ""Stay"" blew me away. ""Phoenix Rising"" has very tight harmonies, and the ballads are great; just like on ""For Lover's Only."" However, the Temp's should have stayed away from hip-hop. I just don't think that is their sound. Otherwise, this compilation is a must have for those who enjoy REAL singing."
2,Not the Temptations,"Nice album. Ok tunes and production but this is NOT THE TEMPTATIONS. Otis legally owns the moniker, but not being an identifiable voice of the golden era Tempts he can do nothing to evoke the sound of the famous quintet. Nothing against the new guys, they just arent't the Tempts. Maybe if Dennis Edwards were back it'd help. This sounds like ""LA Soul"""""
5,Always been a huge Temps fan and this CD is on the money.,"Despite Rickey Wright's critique, I think this CD is excellent. ALL the songs are good but the best one on it is ""This Is My Promise"" and ""Take Me In Your Arms"". I know most folks favor ""the classic five"" but these gentlemen have it going on. Way to go Otis!! Let's see how many groups today will still be going strong some 30 odd years later!"
2,not remotely like the classic lineup,"I was very, very disappointed with this album. There is nothing remotely similar to the classic Temptations lineups of the 60s and 70s that I loved so much to be found on this album. These new guys in the group are talented singers, no question about that, but vocal gymnastics does not equal great music in my mind. No matter how well they harmonize, it can't lift this very weak material from mediocrity. They shouldn't even be using the name Temptations. Not only does this album not have songs with the quality of their past recordings, the spirit does not seem the same either. Basically, this is generic 90s R&B with no soul."
5,Wonderful CD,"The temptations has always been one of my favorite groups and this cd is sexy and it's reminiscent of a time when music was really about love and not ""booty poppin'"". Great songs! Great cd!"
5,"Refreshing, reminiscent, danceable, charming, wonderful!","This is a soulful addition to the Temptations long line of successful albums. ""How Could He Hurt You"" is just as touching after 3,000 plays as it is the first time, ""Stay"" gives me shivers, and ""My Promise,"" as promised, makes ""the hair on the nape of my neck stand up.""The new voices are solid and meld very well with Ron Tyson's. Barrington's, especially, serves as Bob Mintzer's saxophone in The Yellowjackets... as a gell, as a shining ray of light, and as very solid ground!The Tempts had some rough times earlier in this decade (anyone remember ""Eenie Meenie Minie Moe""?) and it doesn't even do this album justice to say they've ""got it all back again."" They've given the act a fresh face with the same strong soulful foundation as ever!No ""false faces"" here!Nick"
5,Fantastic Recipes!!,If you love soup this book is for you. I have already tried several of the recipes in the book and they were all fantastic - easy to follow instructions and great variety. I would recommend this book to anybody and have already bought copies for gifts!
1,Advice from a guy with multiple bankruptcies,"On 10/5/00, Bloomberg News accounts said Wade Cook Financial Corp. would offer refunds to thousands of investors who attended Wade Cook stock-market seminars. This was to settle action brought against Wade Cook FC by the Federal Trade Commission. Cook was also sued by the attorneys general of the states of AL, AZ, CA, ID, IL, KS, MO, NC, NM, OK, OR, PA, TX, and WA."
1,There are a lot of books which are much better,"Wade Cook's books are just a bunch of hype. There are several other books that are much better.1)I recommend ""Buy Rent Sell"" by Robert Irwin. It is easy to read and gives you the basics.2) ""Investing in Real Estate"" by Andrew Mc Lean and Gary W. Eldred. PHD. This book goes into more detail than ""Buy Rent Sell"", but it is a harder read."
1,Pabulum for the ignorant,"Typical of all Wade Cook's books, his main focus is trying to get people to keep buying his numerous other products; seminar's, other books, membership in his investment club, etc.. If his schemes really worked, he would be dumping every penny into these ""hot money makers"". Why spend the money for radio ads and other advertising that promote books and seminars? Hmm? Think about it."
5,A good book undeserving of crackpot reviews,"Don't let the size of this book fool you, it is jam packed with usefull information from somene who can speak from experience, Wade Cook.This book belongs in the library of any serious real estate investor."
1,An Advertisement for His Other Books...That's IT!!,"What a huge waste of money. Yes, it is a quick read. With short sentences. With little, if any, value. My husband and I are looking to get into the foreclosure market and this very expensive 100 page paperback book did nothing to enlighten us to the steps necessary to get started.The book is so basic as to be useless. If you were to look at the table of contents, as I did, you would assume that there is a large amount to be learned...not so. The book is so generic and so simple that it really tells you absolutely nothing. I would very much like my money back...what a waste of time and energy reading this book.Now, if you are looking for suggestions, Flipping Properties has been an interesting read, as well as 106 Mortgage Secrets All Homebuyers Must Learn (more for the homeowner than the investor, but still good info). These actually have information, not generic sentences that lead you nowhere...or to another book. Do not waste your time..."
4,Florida Death Metal like Diabolic,"If you like Diabolic you definitely will like Unholy Ghost, not just because ex-Diabolic drummer Aantar Coates plays for Unholy Ghost now, but because they sound very similar. This is pure blackened death metal. If you like blasting death metal with evil lyrics and vocals, and an overall anti-christian attitude you will love this band. Unholy Ghost is not very original, however, and other Florida blackened death metal bands like Morbid Angel and Deicide are still a lot better. This band is about the same as Diabolic, they are both very good bands, but neither of them outshine the other. If you're a death metal diehard you better buy this album, it rips."
4,Not for younger babies.,"I bought this series believing it to be only a touchy feely book. My son is 8 mths old so he sucks and pulls every thing.Unfortunatley, this series has flaps and tabs that such a little baby just ruins. Don't get me wrong I love these books. The covers are spongy ie the blue balloon is smooth, the red is material, the yellow fuzzy, the green canvas. Beware the blue has a feather in it which a baby can pull out. Do not leave these books with the littlies to read by themselves, it could be hazardousThe books are too flimsy for babies. If you baby is older and knows how to treat a book when you read it, these books are terrific. I am saving them for later but I wish I had known the strength of the pages before.They are beautifully set out just not able to endure a tough life with very small people"
4,A Simple Little Documentary,"You get a basic idea of who they where. It was entertaining and informative. Nothing mayor, you get a basic idea."
1,worst kataklysm cd yet,"When i first got this cd i thought it was decent but then i soon realized that this is there worst cd yet. It doesn't hold a candle to any of there earlier stuff. The vocals are annoying, the guitar riffs which at one time were technically amazing and brutal have now been reduced to bland nu metal-esqe crap and the lyrics are the most mediocre and lame ones i've read, it sounds like they have been taking pages out of korns lyric book. Do yourself a favor and avoid this tasteless drivel buy masterpieces like Sorcery, Temple of knowledge, or mystical gate of reincarnation, those albums are classics!"
5,"Don't waste your time reading this, BUY IT NOW.","I've got Kataklysm's last 3 cd's and as much as i like them there just seemed to be something missing, like a song here or there that didn't fit that felt like filler, or something, well this cd will go down as there pinnacle, this is there Master or Puppets, or slaughter of the soul, you get where i'm going with this, I love every fricken song on this Cd, this Cd is killer, My vote for Metal Cd of 2004 and it's only march, i'm babbling now so stop reading and just go buy it."
2,Really sub-par death metal.,"I like death metal, sure, but this album really has little worth. The lyrics have little variation in themes (pain, killing, being better than the rest) and I can only hope they were written after and secondary to the music.Unfortunately, there's nothing fantastic about any of the guitar work, either. Martin Maurais is the only reason I give this album any sort of credit. I saw Kataklysm open for Cannibal Corpse and Napalm Death, and Martin played flawlessly, including when he did a lengthy and faster-than-light drum solo. The man is amazing, and I can only hope Kataklysm is some sort of temporary gig until he gets to where he belongs.If you're looking for sick guitar solos and technical playing, Kataklysm and ""Serenity in Fire"" probably aren't the way to go. This album might be good if you just want some constant growling in the background while you're doing other things."
4,"LOUD, CHAOTIC... KILLER!!!","Killer guitar riffs, chaotic drums-blast-beats, awesome vocal work, are the ingredients for a great melodic-death metal album with blackish influences. If you like the technique, the loud sound, the high speed drums and the Death Metal in general, you need to buy this album."
4,Early Wonder,"This greatest hits album collects Stevie Wonder's first hits from 1963 to 1967. The only song that really standouts from when he was known as Little Stevie Wonder is the explosive live performance of ""Fingertips"" which went to number one. The other songs from that time like ""Workout Stevie, Workout"" try to capture that explosiveness, but don't manage to find it. As he got older and matured, so did his music and the songs started to show off his immense talents. ""Uptight"" is a pure classic as is ""I Was Made To Love Her"". He also started to develop and show a social conscious side with the brilliant ""A Place In The Sun"" and he takes Bob Dylan's folk anthem ""Blowin' In The Wind"" and turns it into a call and response, gospel flavored number."
2,His Early Hits Obviously Aren't What Made Him Great,"I just purchased this CD at the local Border's outlet....and I still think I spent too much. Outside of ""Uptight"" and ""I Was Made To Love Her"" there isn't much here to recommend. Do as I should and get his later compilations"
1,Much Adored Trumpeter on a Recording Date to Forget,"This two-disc set arrived with great promise and is already in the garbage. My tolerance for poor recordings of seminal live jazz is ample. This turkey pushed me over the edge though. That the drums are way ahead of everything else is only the most obvious problem. The horns are under water and sputtering. I really tried to ""dig"" this set but it's just awful listening."
2,Crappy recording,No one is that much a MUST-HAVE fan to release these recordings. I expected better from LHJ. They should have put a disclaimer on the package.
1,"Poor sound quality, forget that cd.","This is the worst sound quality of LonehillJazz cd:s, which I have ever heard. It is not a joy to listen this. It is a pity, that this type of cd's still appear. You could not know this when buing this. I would call it cheating."
5,Grandson loves it,My grandson loves to play this game. He enjoys watching the Backyardigans and thought that this was a great Xmas gift.
4,great product,my children love this. it's help them learn and have fun doing it! this will help them in school better as well. thank you
4,Good game,"It arrived quickly and child loves it. I think it could have a little more to it. Also, the cartridge itself doesn't seem very secure when in the system and it's a brand new system."
3,Kind of short.,"I got this for my daughter for her fifth birthday and she completed it in about an hour. Kind of disappointing, but it might be better for a younger child."
2,Boring!,"My kids didn't like it. Played one time and didn't touch it after that. Put ""educational"" in front of everything then it is, right?! Of course!"
4,another great product from v. smile,"bought this for my 5-year old because she loves the cartoon so much. she already has 9 games for her system, and loves this one just as much as the others. this game moved to the top of the frequently played list right away.i would complain about not being able to tear her away from her video games, but it's an educational toy, and she doesn't even realize she's learning something new. can't help but love it."
2,Writing is illegible,"The writing is on the underside of mat so it shows through very faintly as others have said. The recipes, grid and measurements are useless. Sample photo does not match product."
2,it's just plastic,"It is just plastic, nothing special about it. I got it because I only have a wooden counter top, and figured my dough would stick to it. When I was rolling out my pasty on this mat, I found it moving all over the place. I suppose this could be fixed my putting something gummy under this, but I would be nice if they took care of that for you."
3,"Norpro Pastry Mat - Made in Everett, WA","I purchased this mat due to the fact that it was made in USA. I was inexpensive and I was in need of a pastry mat with basic markings. For the things I make most frequently, I highlighted the hash marks on length and width to the sizes I use most, as the ruler markings are difficult to read. It stores nicely with my baking pans standing up, so I don't have the issue of getting it to lay flat. I have avoided putting anything hot on it until I am able to find a made in USA silicon pastry mat. The recipes are illegible but this is not the reason I purchased it. It reminds me of the Tupperware pastry mat my mom had for years. It will do for the time being."
3,Pastry Mat,Purchased this mat to replace one I had sliced into making bear claws. It is very stiff and a challenge to store. I do appreciate how sturdy it is and that markings are very clear.
1,Invisible writing,"The printing on the underside of the mat is completely illegible. It is nearly impossible to see even the grid lines when it is placed on the counter.The product is not at all as described, and the picture gives a false idea of its usefulness (or lack there of as it were)."
3,Faint writing,The printing is done on the underside of the mat. It shows through very faintly. It does not show as well as the sample shows. It's hard to read the words and measurements.
3,"Hard to read, store","Works just fine, but apparently not meant to be rolled up for storage--inconvenient. It is a bit challenging to read the markings on the underside of the mat. Otherwise, does its job."
3,Could be happier,Has been a useful purchase. Two negatives: it slides on the counter when I am rolling out dough and it does not roll or fold for easy storage.
4,Does what it says buy it is giant,This works well it just takes up a lot of space. It is flexible but can not be rolled up or anything.
4,A wonderful pastry mat,"Having read the other reviews, I had to add my two cents. Yes, markings are a bit hard to read; it is a very big mat, hard to store etc... However, as a basic, large and easy to use pastry mat it is terrific. There is plenty of room to roll out the largest pie dough with lots of room for the extra flour. I store it standing up in my pantry, so it doesn't take up lots of space."
2,Stylish but lack performance in the real world,"These rather expensive gaiters did not live up to my expectations. They are stylish and use good materials but their construction has problems. I used them in a recent weekend trip only to discover that the snow is pushed upward and inside between the gaiter and the side of the boots. All my previous gaiters used elastic at the bottom in order to secure a good fit between the gaiter cloth and the boots, whereas this model relies in a perfect fit. Such perfect fit is hard to obtain also due to the natural arching of the boots on their inside."
3,Great functionality but question the design,"I have owned two pairs of these gaiters. Both times the overlay sewn in place to secure the inside strap has torn (and I'm not wearing crampons when this happens). Despite that, fit is great and functionality excellent. OR has replaced them twice at N/C however I am beginning to doubt the design and considering trying a different brand."
3,Size Change?,"I bought these as a replacement for my old OR Crocodiles which had too much crampon damage (fixed with shoe glue :-) ) and I thought I was getting the very same product, which had worked for me well for the last 4 years. However when I first put them on I noticed that they seemed to fit larger than the old ones - almost to the point of being too large for me.Also - the covering of the small Velcro piece at the upper bottom portion separated after just 2 outings. The same part also separated in my old gaiters but only after a couple of years of use.Overall - they still do a good job of keeping the snow from falling inside your boots but I'm a little concerned about the quality (and the apparent sizing change)."
4,"Better than overboots, cheaper than overpants!","I decided on these over a much more expensive pair of Gore-tex overpants for a week-long odyssey through the rain forests of the Pacific Northwest. Most of the rest of my group went with the overpants and Neo overshoes... in the end I was nearly as dry, and much more comfortable than the rest. The real proof of quality is that the ""guide"" in my group and all the other guides (guys that do this professionally) were wearing this exact gaiter.TL;DR:Pros:Well made, waterproof (ended up shin-deep in a marsh without complaint), and the fit was excellent (10.5 boot, Large gaiters).Cons:A flaw inherent to gaiters: they wick moisture up to the (on me) knee area of the pants.It's difficult to get them on perfectly straight thanks to the little metal hook at the bottom of the closure."
5,Gaiters,"Look good, did their job. Hate so say I have not used them in heavy snow but they worked as intended"
4,Size,Item is durable and works great but sized to fit very large person with monster thighs. Men's Large to big for most people.
5,Gaiters,What you see is what you get.. They fit well and are easy to wash off after mudding through the wet trails..
3,They fit great.,"I am a shoe size 12US and am 6'2"" and 242lbs. I ordered the Xlarge and am glad I did. These fit super snug around my mountaineering boots and fit well over crampons also. The top closures lack needed tightening space. This is easily remedied with multiple layers of pants. The material is of good quality. As for their functionality I have yet to use them in the ice so that is a story for later."
5,perfect... will wear,I wore these everyday for over a week while hiking Kilimanjaro and they were perfect.they did fray at the bottom a bit but the terrain was rough (stones/rocks etc) so I am not surprised...they protected me and my boots perfectly and the hook ensured they stay in place... no issue with these!
4,beach music rocks again,great example of early beach music. Ocean boulevard is an all time classic/ some interesting interpretations on other cuts.
4,"A fine, unassuming and thoroughly enjoyable dance record","This is one fun CD, 40 minutes-plus of catchy and eminently enjoyable dance-rock. Beach music is mostly a southern phenomenon but this record would have delighted a lot of kids at my high school in the heart of New York City back when. Curiously, even though this is a compilation of older recordings remixed (and we'd like to hear the originals sometime), it builds in intensity and virtuosity after a strong (if not totally effective) start, and if you're like me you'll end up loving this CD about a third of the way through. And it does make me want to hear how these guys sound live -- their playing is superb here and the harmonies on numbers like ""Ocean Boulevard"" make you want to go back to it over and over."
2,"Contains Their Most Classic Song, But.................","Hawkwind can really be an annoying band. Through the years they've made tons of records,most of them pure junk.Occasionally they actually had listenable moments. ""Hurry On Sundown"" (I believe actually was a single too)is on this release and is maybe their best and most memorable tune. The rest tries to recreate early Floyd and Tangerine dream without the vision of those bands.They probably had the least interesting guitarist in the history of prog rock(Dave Brock I think ?), who could do little more than play power chords.There is really little ""playing"" to speak of;mostly repetitive droning with spacey noises in the background.I guess you had to be there live and experience their shows with the proper chemical enhancement to appreciate this."
4,Excellent introduction to isotope geochemistry,This book provides a good overview of the topic of isotope geochemistry. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to begin building an understanding of this material
4,runs a little small,I got this for my daughter-in-law as surprise. It definitely runs small. She wears a medium to large and the large costume was to small. Buy at least one size bigger than you need. But it arrived on time and service was excellent.
4,Derrick L. Carter* - Nearest Hits & Greatest Misses,"Nearest Hits & Greatest Misses, Derrick Carter's collection of various remixes, shows how a good remix can take a bad song a long way. The Latin house number ""La Tropicana,"" for instance, gets darker with some deeper percussion as well. Modjo, as well, has ""Chillin'"" transformed into something more than simply a cash-in on the whole French house craze. But with excellent originals, the challenge becomes how to emphasize what makes it good without obliterating the piece. He, thankfully, mostly leaves The Human League's ""Don't You Want Me"" alone, while emphasizing the beat on Karen Ramirez' ""Troubled Girl."" Some of the tracks seem abruptly edited, however, which interferes with the flow of the album. Still, this is a worthwhile album if you're a fan of Carter. And you should be."
3,reveiw of rex,this pice of equipment is very helpful just hook it up to your pc upload your day and your on the go. If you have troble organizing your day this is the item for you. I always had troble remembering things until I got this item
2,not the best,"I found myself nearly 80 pages into this book and still had not learned anything new. I put it down. I had a long weekend, so I picked up and read the rest. It was there I discovered a few factual errors that is likely to get a neophyte into trouble. Turpentine is not the same as mineral spirits. They work similarly, but are different products. Most every product labeled Tung Oil _FINISH_ is not tung oil and does not contain tung oil. They are either thinned varnish (wiping varnish) or oil-varnish blends (with linseed oil). Thrown into the mix is ""Danish Oil"" that is never really explained. To top it all off is the dreaded linseed oil + turpentine + vinegar concoction that is a disaster for furniture.A reader at any level would be much better off getting Bob Flexner's Understanding Wood Finishes and cut through the myths and misleading labels.The book's owner (a relative) offered it to me for free and I declined."
3,"Helpful, But Too Gabby","I bought this book after reading the reviews on Amazon.com. While I found it helpful, I felt the author spent too much time writing about himself. Being a writer myself, I found the book too wordy. I want more direct information without all of the anecdotal stuff. Please get to the point! And while some of the points were good, many of my woodworking friends disagreed with some of the information.I also bought ""Finishes & Finishing Techniques"" published by Taunton Press. It was a more expensive book, but I thought it was money better spent."
2,Very Basic,No photo's to accompany text. Very cheaply put together as the paper that is used seems to be the type used in kindergarten class. Very dissapointing.
4,Femme Fatale,"I tried to find this for years. Gabor mentioned it during his Blue Parrot gig in La Jolla, CA in the early 1980's. It needs listening and rewards one with an interesting evolution of his style and playing. It also generates that flight into a new place."
5,Christmas in one small package,"Of all the English Christmas recordings from all the various cathedrals, colleges, choirs, and choruses, and I love them all, this recording is probably my favorite. It is performed by a classic English choir of men and boys with an organ, but no additional choirs, orchestras, or brass bands, so there are no 1812 overture style crescendos. On the other hand, it is no sleepy series of lullabies all sounding alike after a while. Each carol setting has its own inner logic, texture, and drama, so each stands out as distinctive from all the others. The relationships among the 3 elements, men, boys, and organ, varies from one carol to another, so that each has its moments to shine, while retelling each version of the old story in its own unique way. The recorded sound is lifelike and crystal clear. As they say, if I could only have one, this would be it!"
5,Great Book,This is a great book. Read how those people who make the final decision think and what they expect from applicants.
4,A Good Little Toy For Johnny Cage Fans,Toys these days are being more and more delicately made. This is one of them. This is not a toy for your little kid to be playing around with. This is a toy for you to put in a nice little pose and for you to leave somewhere.You can pose this toy very well. It comes with a base and two extra pairs of hands. (although I would've preferred if they had given him an actual weapon instead of useless interchangeable limbs you hardly notice.) Anyways if you're a big Johnny Cage fan and you have a nice little area to leave it in it's perfect. I bought mine at toys r us for 6 bucks.
3,careful!!!!!!!!!,Be careful of this toy it could break.Always read reviews to see if the stuff you want is good!
5,Music book,"The book is a must have for all serious violin students and beginners, well worth the price you pay for it."
1,slow and uninteresting,"It's a much too slow moving violin book. It lingers on the open strings for nearly half the book, in little small songs that don't keep your interest. The other half of the book is pretty much unhelpful, piano duets that are at a level for which you don't get to be prepared for.A CD is included, but it's useless and confusing, with the unnecessary orchestra accompanying the bland simple melody. It's only useful if you haven't a metronome.There's software included, but as a beginner with little music background, there's not much use for a program to write your own music. But, I suppose the software is the nicest thing out of the package.The DVD's okay, giving a little video tutorial, but it's not substantial.There are better beginner violin books out there, I'd recommend the ABC's of Violin!"
2,Not such a great product for a beginner...,It's alright I suppose but not really that easy to understand. And forget using the CD that comes with it...............it froze my computer up big time! Not really pleased with it at all. I bought a used copy and they said it was good and it was so full of writing and stickers......it obviously was a kids book. Drove me nuts. I just really didn't care for it at all. I like the Dummie books much much better. They explain things much better...........this book has little to no instruction. It is more suited for someone taking lessons with a real violin teacher!!! Not someone trying to learn on their own.
4,ok,this product is very good. it shipped 3 days before estimated delivery date. i would recommend this product to beginners that aren't that serious because the it doesn't sound good
2,Essential Elements leaves much to be desired.,"If you are looking for a book that will teach you a variety of music and styles, this is not the one. All the songs look like they were arranged and composed at the last minute. Only 1 song (simple gifts) is anywere near the original composition of the composer. For a real violin study, go with Suzuki."
3,Essential Elements 2000 for strings,Can't really rate this item yet until i use it. waiting on Violin. then i will give this item a complete rating
4,excellent resource for beginners,My 3rd grader is just getting started and this is the book her teacher uses. This book is easy enough for her to understand and enhances her desire to practice.
3,Affordable,Schools now are requiring students to provide their own books; a product of budget cuts. Thank you Amazon for providing an affordable option. We are very happy with our purchase. The only issue we have is that the CD didn't work for some reason. The CD was not required for school so we did not send it back. The book was perfectly fine.
3,Good deal,The disks that came with the book had a lot of sticky soda or something on it but was ok for my sons violin class
5,excellent violin method,"This is an excellent first book for the violin. I have started learning violin again after a 24 year break! This book is aesthetic, has very clear instructions and diagrams and is designed beautifully. The progression of the exercises is completely logical, allowing you to perfect each technique before moving on. Every symbol is explained clearly, no new note or technique is found in exercises that come before their explanation. There are numerous scale and arpeggio exercises that are marked with a different background color, making it easier to find them. There are many orchestra arrangements (mostly duets), and even a duet with piano accompaniment. The accompanying discs are an added attraction. I don't particularly make very much use of them, but they can make practicing more interesting for children who generally have less discipline. This is a much better series than The ABCs of Violin."
3,Best Suited for Children,"I bought this book because it had a DVD and CD. I had already started learning the violin, and most of the pieces in this book were far simpler than the ones I had been playing in another beginner book. The DVD shows only very basic information, and is full of admonishments to ""listen to your teacher, do not do X until your teacher says to"". This book is really for kids, as the very simple arrangements and 'compositiion' assignments show. I hoped that the bowing exercises would be useful, and they are, but not enough to justify buying this book for an adult."
3,Simple instruction,I bought the book for a beginner in the violin. It is very easy to follow and learn from. Great book for anyone wanting to learn violin.
3,It's a good book,"This seems like some kind of course manual, You won't get a super in depth tutorial on it, but if you want to learn to read music, I would suggest it."
4,Baseball Shoes,They arrived when they were supposed to. They seemed to run a little small and are pretty narrow. They have been a good product thus far.
2,What happened to DJ Kicks?,"Hard to believe this is in the same series as Rockers, K&D, Kid Loco, Cam...maybe all these DJ's (Playgroup, Chicken Lips etc.) peddling this 80's crap think this is cool but for those of us old enough to remember, the music from that decade was mostly horrifying. All you people with your new wave hairdos go get a haircut."
1,Banal rubbish,Most of these songs were dug out of the archives and thats where they should have remained. This really does not work musically or as a concept for the 70's/80's sound. There are about three very good songs on this but the rest are bad and then even worse rubbish. These songs should have been torched and destroyed (back in the 70/80's) as they are just plain and simply brutal.
1,Very Poor Design,A very poor design that came nowhere close to meeting my high expectations. I took it out of its wooden casing and then connected the head of the brush by screwing it back into the casing. The head of the brush then became stuck! I tried removing it using all sorts of methods -- to no avail. Their other products are great. But be warned: this one is a waste of your money!
5,Fantastic Travel Brush,"I use a shaving brush and soap every day to shave and I travel a lot. I had been using an inexpensive travel shaving brush and it was coarse and scratchy. This one from The Art Of Shaving is fantastic. Silvertip badger hair, the same is the larger ""for at home"" brushes. The design is smart too. The brush stores in the handle to protect the brush when packing, but the end of the handle is open so when the brush is put away wet it can dry while packed. Overall an expense luxury but one that is well made and worth the price. Highly recommended if you shave with a brush and soap."
4,An overlooked book of essays on Cervantes' greatest work,Contains an introduction by M. J. Benardette and four essays:The Genesis by Ramon Mendendez PidalThe Social and Historical Background by A. Morel-FatioThe Style by Helmut HatzfeldHamlet and Don Quixote by Ivan Turgenev
1,Worst game ever,"This is by far the worst game I have ever purchased for my xbox. The fact that xbox even allowed this game to come out with its quality and ""bore"" factor makes me want to trade my xbox in on another system. There is no action and all the sounds are the same."
3,Interesting perspectives but not what I had expected,"Written from a global perspective... Pilots need to be detail-oriented. Pilots know that sometimes one can learn more from listening than from speaking. Etc.Clearly Mr. Buck is an excellent and experienced pilot, and I would have been comforted as a passenger knowing that he was on the flight deck. But it's not exactly what I had expected."
3,"Cheesy, but good for dancing.","All the music on this CD carries a beat that works very well for Rumba.However, when listening to a few of the songs, it sounds like this isn't an actual recording of a string orchestra, but is rather synthesized. This is generally most apparent in the introductions and any point that is not masked by singing. Thus, don't go thinking this is actually a new gathering of the 101 Strings Orchestra; it's more of an attempt to profit from their fame.Overall, it sounds a bit cheesy, but still works well for dancing."
5,Great Christmas Read!,"Buffalo valley has run into a big problem that could destroy what the community has worked so hard to rebuild. Valu-X is planning to build in their town, and no one in Buffalo Valley will welcome the retail chain nicely. With Christmas on the way can every one still pact together to keep Valu-X out?Carrie Hendrickson is re-introduced to Buffalo Valley working for Hassie as an intern for the pharmacy.Vaughn Kyle is a man that has his life mapped out perfectly. He has a very successful girlfriend, a great new job that he starts the first of the year. Vaughn decides to go home to see his parents for Christmas, but in the short time he's there his whole life, career, girlfriend - are now a big question mark!This novel has great characters, plot and town! I love how this town pulls together no matter what! I hope Debbie Macomber takes us back to Buffalo Valley someday."
3,Love Buffalo Valley but should have stopped at book 3,I was disappointed in this book. I loved the first three but this story line was weak and didn't keep me wanting to read more.
3,Very cute!,This was a very cute. Either I just don't like really gushy lovestories or this one was just too easy to guess. I did enjoy itthough. A good beach read.
4,Good,As usual Debbie Macomber writes a good book. This was a good ending to the Dakota series. Going to finish the Cedar Cove series next.
4,Buffalo Valley,Keep them coming. Good easy read. Love Macomber stories. They are interesting and a person can not put the book down.
3,Easy read,"Good, quick read . not going to win a pulitzer but itwas fun reading roght begore the holidays. wanns visit dakota"
1,buffalo valley,I really can not writea review for this book as the seller didn't send it. They actuallt sent me two copies of the other book I ordered.
1,Buffalo Valley,The author writes light romance novels while only mentioning towns in North Dakota and nothing else resembles it.
3,Worth renewing your memory of this play,"Not often revived, very controversial in its day - and would be today. Prescient take on the future (from that period) on unconventional relationships."
3,puts you to sleep,"I was looking for a hot Cha Cha Cha that I could dance to and this CD absoultely did not do it for me. It's a very slow cha cha,"
3,mostly good cha-cha's,"some good cha-cha's but mostly mediocre. I teach ballroom dancing and am always looking for good music, This should do it"
2,NOT A GOOD BUY,"I ORDERED THIS HEADSET FOR MY CELLPHONE BECOUSE OF THE PRICE, WHEN I GOT IT, IT IS DEFENETLY NOT SAMSUNG, BUT SOME CHINEESE CHEAP COPY OF IT.POOR QUALITY AND BAD SOUND.STAY AWAY FROM IT."
2,Headset was broken,"I bought this item from Eforcity, the headset was broken when it arrived. Eforcity would not pay the return postage, even though the item was defective."
4,I love it,"I have been using this for my Samsung T629 phone and it works just great. I use it to listen to the music on the phone and the sound is crystal clear. The only thing I don't like about this product is that the length of one of the buds is longer than the other. It makes me feel weird, but other than that everything else is just great."
4,too big,I was so excited to get these ear buds so that I can listen to my MP3 player at school. But the ear buds keep falling out. So I'm constantly trying to shove them in my ears which make them sore. I wish they would have come with ear hooks or something.(it may be that my ears are too small though -not sure :)
4,Necessary evil made easier,"Citing online resources is a necessary evil and this quicksheet makes it lots easier. The author pretty much covers all the bases and gives examples for all types of potential sources one might run into. It's a little difficult to quickly find the right example but I think that as I use it more, it'll get easier and quicker."
2,Citation review sheet - not what you really need,"Elizebeth Mills is increasingly referred to as one of the main citation sources for genealogical methods and standards. While this 2 sheet laminated card does help, I wasn't thrilled when I received it.Opening my wondeful Amazon box (with other goodies) it was ""oh yeah, hmm"".The sheet is not really worth the money cause it misses some elements of citation - especially if you are international - rather than being based in the US.But then again, for the time, effort and expense of getting your own copy laminated it might be a bad option.Personally, I feel this double sided sheet should have been added and available for free in conjunction with her book ""Evidence! Citation & Analysis for the Family Historian"" ISBN-10: 0806315431Conclusion: Have a review yourself with the ""Search Inside"" and see whether it suits you."
2,It's outdated and wrong in places,"The problem with this particular QuickSheet is that it was written in 2007, before Elizabeth Mills changed her philosophy about citations for the 2nd edition of her book. She no longer recommends some of the practices that are outlined on this QuickSheet. The QuickSheet for Ancestry.com is up-to-date, as it was written in 2010."
2,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS EPISODES?!,"Typical jess franco offbeat junk, with interchangable plots; TWO UNDERCOVER ANGELS is a female James Bond movie with some semi-werewolf, while KISS ME MONSTER has a Frankenstein monster without any makeup. These are generic 1960s movies, as far from any high concept contemporary movie as you can get.Both are eurotrash adventures, with a few seconds of topless nudity, and made quick---which is why Franco directed over 100 movies; he was able to hack out such stuff on a shoestring; that was the ""talent"" eurotrash producers wanted.Both movies come across as fascist spain versions of 1960s edgar wallace movies made in germany. And, they also seem like ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS episodes!If you're a jess franco or eurotrash fan you'll probably like these movies, with franco even making a cameo in both movies. UNDERCOVER ANGELS even begins like a mario bava thriller, with a model in a wedding dress being stalked."
3,"A rather free translation, but that's allright","Those of you who can read French, consider buying the work by Henri Gougand, la Chanson de la croisade albigeoise, because this one contains the original document on the left, and the translation on the right. But that doesn't mean Shirley's translation is bad, it is a translation that doesn't match the rhyme that Guillame (William) de Tudéla and his anonymous successor used. In fact, Shirley's translation is more readable than the original manuscript and offers in depth details that the other chroniquer of the Albigensian crusade, Pierre the Vaux-des-Cernay, does not mention. The introduction by Janet Shirley is one of the most compact and informative written pieces on this subject yet. And the story itself is still readable after almost seven centuries. Those who are intrested in the Albigensian Crusade, and want to have a look at a genuine source should consider buying this translation"
2,100 minutes of clips.,Film clips of most of the big Charles Bronson Films. Not what I expected. I was hoping for more of a biography.
3,It's an okay movie for an average fan,"As it says in my title, It's an okay movie for an average fan. I brought it from an Small Movie Rental Store that was selling movies of little interest to the public. I watched it and it was like the reruns on TBS, just a little longer and it takes place mostly in Hong Kong when it was a British Coloney (with some phrases spoken in Chinese) Peter, A girl and an Ex-Marine must go to Hong Kong to clear the girl's uncle's name from a murder after WWII. But danger lurks in Hong Kong, and It's up to Spider-Man to save them. I'd like to tell you more, but it'd spoil the 'movie'"
2,Short Stories on a VIllage,"""In the Village of Viger"" is a disappointing book in that the more interesting stories need expanding and the less interesting stories need editing out. The book is really a collection of short stories. Just when you think you are getting to know a character there is a sudden switch to a new chapter and a new character, then that one disappears and the cycle goes on. A village has atmosphere - it has seasons, it has a community spirit, it has survived for a long time with a blend of the environment and people's responses to it. None of this comes through in the book. It is rather bland and the people have no depth. Is it set in Canada? One would hardly know as there is no empathy for the village, the landscape or the people. It is almost written to a formula and that is very sad. There are plenty of books on villages that bring the place and its people to life - this does neither."
3,"Excelent music, ruined by lackluster performance","As much as I love the music on this album, I simply could not get over the lackluster vocal technique. There were many times when it was ALMOST very, very good, but the voices simply did not have enough resonance, and many of the soloists were off-pitch. One of the best features of all-male vocal ensembles (precise close harmony producing harmonic overtones) simply was not present to a degree that I would have liked. Excellent arrangements, okay singing, but not a great album."
4,definitely a good buy,"for someone of persian descent, this album artfully presents the familiar, comforting, and beautiful sounds of classical persian music. bijan plays excellent violin, though if you're looking for solos of other persian instruments, such as santour or dombak, you may want to supplement this CD with others.for anyone looking to choreograph traditional persian dance pieces for groups, tracks 5 and 6 provide solid instrumentals with good beats and good melodies, and they have the characteristic sound of persian music that will get an audience excited.a few of the tracks are a little too dramatic and/or synthesized for my taste, but there's a nice variety of sound throughout, and you'll probably be able to get some good use out of this CD. i recommend it."
3,Its OK,"It didn't provide me with the detail I wanted (my fault) but it was helpful as a first time visitor to DC to see the Museums, etc."
5,sleek and sophisticated,Yes - this is a sleek and sophisticated cable. I used it to connect my mac mini and LCD TV. Turns out (by luck) that the cable matches the mac in color and texture - a big plus - and feels like a quality product (not my typical experience with Belkin). The price was reasonable.
2,interesting enough,"Its an interesting enough book, unusual, perhaps unecessarily bamboozling in its language for most, and somehow dupes you into thinking it is deeper than it is by the complexity of language. However there are bits that are trully beautiful, that entice one to a level of honesty not normally encountered. A lot of merit in that. There is no doubt Lujan Matus is a clever man. I have met him and having experienced culty charismatic characters before, he is definitely a stereotypical example. I'd caution anyone who gets involved to maintain their personal sovereignty, keep your eyes open, and stay in touch with your heart."
2,Fishy,"Most of the 5 star reviews here are the ONLY reviews that the reviewers made.What's up with that?!I found the book to be well-intentioned while also rambling and perhaps a bit confused.obviously the author is doing his best to convey his experiences through the written word and that is something to be commended. the allusion of the author's name to Castaneda's ""don Lujan"" is a bit comical."
1,a mess,"This is really a bad book, there's no other way to say it. No exposition at all about who this guy is or where he learned what he knows. Mostly it's some kind of dream story, but later he talks about a group of friends he has and their various shortcomings, he being some kind of guru type. It's so scattered that it's really hard to tell what he's talking about at all. I would say this book has no real relation to any Casaneda concepts and I would strongly recommend that you pass on reading it."
1,Especially [Bad],"if only i'd read the poor reviews, before reading. i kept reading...hoping it would get better--it never did.no plot, and certainly no mystery, whatsoever.the more you read, the dumber the story gets.a complete waste of reading time."
1,Boring and pointless,"I liked Le Divorce (except for its absurd ending). But Le Mariage is a complete disappointment. Stolen manuscripts, millenium cults, surprise imprisonment -- huh? It comes off as unrealistic and silly, a waste of good writing talent. Not nearly as many funny lines or observations as in Le Divorce. Truly awful."
1,Another disappointing wedding,"Since I loved Le Divorce, I expected to thoroughly enjoy Le Mariage. However, I was completely disappointed in Le Mariage. There are at least three different stories only very loosely tied together. Did I miss something or do the survivalists and the manuscript thefts have something to do with each other?I came away from the book not liking a single character -- well, maybe Clara a little."
3,Hard to believe she also wrote LE DIVORCE,"I'm not even that far into the book and I'm already disappointed! There are so many characters introduced in the first few pages, in such convoluted scenarios, I nearly gave up. What happened to the author who wrote LE DIVORCE - - - a book that literally flowed from page to page? I have another ""favorite"" author who also went this way of the ill advised ""More complicated is better"" (NOT) way. I hate to say, that I have found a certain unevenness in other Diane Johnson novels. For example, I liked PERSIAN NIGHTS & HEALTH & HAPPINESS; couldn't finish THE SHADOW KNOWS. Sure hope Ms. Johnson reads these reviews!"
2,Who edited this book??!!,"My first by this author, and the last I'm afraid now that I've read others comments. This story had potential but it went nowhere. So many unclear issues...and way too long. Will the editor please do a better job on her work!!"
2,Contrived and boring,"I had really enjoyed Le Divorce and expected this book to hold my attention. But the plot was all over the place, and none of the many characters were central enough or felt real enough to care about. Perhaps if I had expected a superficial froth it might have worked for me."
2,"good writer, okay book","Only read this book if it's around and you have nothing better to read, and don't expect a lot. Unsatisfying, too many loose ends."
2,Promising plot that never delivers...,"Because I enjoyed Johnson's previous book 'Le Divorce' so much, I assumed that I'd find this one at least amusing - not so. While I enjoyed the glimpse of Americans living in France, the surrounding story and attempt at a suspenseful plot did nothing for me. Murder, Ancient Manuscript Theft, Love Affairs - this book could have been so promising, yet the storyline never delivered. Save yourself some time and read 'Le Divorce' instead (although don't rent the movie, even Kate Hudson couldn't save that one!)"
2,A Lot of Hype,"I found this book in the bookstore and thought it looked like a fun read. I have never read Le Divorce, but it's got to be better than this book, for this book to get so much hype. It took forever for me to really get interested; I kept reconsidering whether I really wanted to continue reading it. It did get better once I got the characters and situations straightened out. However, at the end, it looked like Ms. Johnson wanted to finish writing this book very badly, as the characters are just dropped, leaving you wondering about them. Very disappointing!!"
1,I felt cheated.,"The editorial review is better fiction than the book. I bought this book because I thought it might be fun to read. I almost quit after a few chapters, Diane's inablity to write complete sentances made it slow going. But her dialog was good and there seemed to be a mystery developing so I perservered. But the mystery was discared somewhere along the way, the situations were unbelieveable and none of the characters developed into anyone I would ever have to spend more than five minutes with. I can't decide if it was a humourless sitcom or a passionless soap opera."
1,Should Have Read the Reviews,"Thankfully I purchased used at a thrift store, but even then I should have read the reviews first. The characters are boring, a couple of them are are down right stupid, and I had trouble finding a reason for their existence. Didn't even make it to to Page 100 before I had to put down out of pure boredom."
3,"Comme ci, comme ca","While I loved Le Divorce, Le Mariage left me cold. This novel seems much more contrived to me, and much less funny. American expatriate reporter Tim is engaged to Anne-Sophie, a sophisticated Parisian woman who sells equestrian-themed antiques in an upscale flea market. Through a series of coincidental events, these two meet up with Clara and Serge Cray, an American actress and her Polish film-director husband who live in a chateau they have restored on the outskirts of Paris. These two couples get entangled with American millennial survivalists, the convoluted French legal system, and the Persand family, who also figure in Le Divorce. I miss the wide-eyed innocence of Isabel, the American ingénue who sees France from a fresh perspective. The characters in this novel all seem too jaded and self-serving to me. I was hoping for ooh la la and laughter, but instead found ho hum and disappointment."
3,Not Up to My Expectations,"I won't write another long review. By the time you get to mine, you have probably read several of the others. Suffice it to say, I did not think this book was even close to the excellence of 'Le Divorce', Diane Johnson's previous book.Basically, this is a book of French/American manners. Though the characterization is well-done and Johnson's writing style excels as always, the narrative is too postured and lacks depth and substance. I suggest 'Le Divorce' instead of 'Le Mariage'."
3,Just OK,"It's well written, and has pithy observations about French people and Americans, their differences and stereotypes. Still, I didn't find Le Mariage a very compelling read. Perhaps it's because in only 320 pages, Diane Johnson crams so many characters that it's hard to really know all of them and, more importantly, care about their troubles. It was a quick enough read, but I have the feeling that, in as little as a month, I'll hardly remember anything about this novel. People who are interested in the lives of Parisians, or those of American expats, might find this a more interesting read than I did."
2,Disappointing after Le Divorce,I loved Diane Johnson's previous book Le Divorce. Having just moved back to this country from Paris at the time of publication I really enjoyed its portrayal of Parisien culture.This book disappointed me. The portrayal of French life seemed less accurate and less deep. The plot seemed contrived and the characters comic cutouts. I wouldn't recommend this book. It wasn't bad but it sure seemed bland and pointless
2,who brought the funny?,"Ok, so I'm only on page 64, but I kind of think any book worth it's salt should provide something interesting by the eleventh chapter. I picked up _Le Mariage_ at the library having heard of it and _Le Divorce_ in various magazines. I expected a light, witty, ""chick book"" that was also intelligent, but so far I've not even considered chuckling once. I'm afraid to finish the book lest I develop an incurable dislike of everything French. I feel like I've been told things about the characters but not shown anything, and therefore I feel no attachment to anyone."
1,Hubris is a terrible thing,"I enjoyed Le Divorce very much, but Le Mariage reads like an unedited first work by a very bad writer. I kept reading along, hoping it would get better, but it just got worse. I had the distinct feeling that after the wild success of Le Divorce, the author got so proud that she told her editor ""You can't possibly tell me to change this book - I'm a best-selling author!"" Painful to read."
1,phone review,poor choice of phone. The display si blurred right out of the box. Worst landline phone i have ever come into contact with.
5,Good deal...,Golf balls were as described... in used condition but pretty much as new. Only 1 or 2 out of the 36 had any real scuff marks and they were very light at that. There was a few Maxfli Lady Noodles in the bunch and about 3 of the 36 had corporate markings but no real big deal. Good golf balls for people on a budget.
3,A dozen Lady Balls are mixed in with regular Noodle Balls,"I received my order today and of the 3 dozen Noodle Balls 1 dozen are Lady Noodle Balls. The product ad does not state that they are mixing Lady Balls in with regular mens balls. The balls are all in A1 shape and more than likely the Lady Balls are probably no different that the regular Noodles, but if your a guy and have a problem playing a Lady's Balls, just be aware of this fact. In my opinion, the product description should plainly state that Lady Balls are mixed in."
3,A nice primer but serious coaches will want more....,"Maybe I was spoiled by the thoroughness of Coverdale and Robinson's ""The Bunch Attack"", or maybe I felt I was rereading Edwards and Chow's ""Winning Football with...."" but I was a little disappointed with what could have been a fantastic treatise on perhaps the most talked about football philosophy of the last 10 years. There are some nice parts of the book, but if your looking for a revelation of the West Coast offense you'll be disappointed. There is nothing on the West Coast Run Game, too little on pass protection, and only basic smatterings of specifics on technique. Think of it as a nice book for beginers"
4,a great guide for an offensive novice,"A nice overview of pro football's most popular offense. I would have liked to have seen more formation diagrams, motion charts and certainly diagrams of running plays."
2,Save Your Money for the One That Remembers the Titles,"Sony seems to be the leader in high-capacity CD players. I bought my 200 disc Sony (the CDPCX250) over 2 years ago and have never had any problems with it. But I'm glad that I insisted on the one that lets me enter the titles, because trying to remember where I put all those discs would be a real bear. And this feature doesn't add much to the price, either.The great feature that I've seen on all high-capacity Sony's is that you can use the same remote on up to 3 CD players, which allows for a lot of growth (my 1st one is full, and I'm ready to buy #2).But insist on one that lets you enter the titles, unless you have a really good memory (and don't think you can get by with those little books they give you to stick all the covers in, either). Some of them even allow you to enter them using a computer keyboard, rather than the little keyboard on the remote."
3,"a lot for the buck, but could be better....","My first one lasted two hours after I loaded it, a cd got stuck in the back and actually damaged the servo that spins the carousel around, so I got it replaced with a new one. After careful comparison with my other cd players, I'm not too impressed with the digital filters... they seem to compress or narrow the stereo field a bit too much for my liking. But for the dollar value, it's not a bad deal."
3,Not bad at all,"I bought my older generation 200 disk machine some time ago and I have not had an iota of problem with it. I particularly like the unlimited shuffle play feature which is a lot of fun if you, like me, have very eclectic musical tastes. I bought the older model which did not permit you to enter disk information but that has not proven to be a big handicap. I really do like the convenience of not having to continually take out and put away CDs."
2,"Sure, the synopsis makes it sound interesting . . .",". . . and it would have been if this book was an actual novel (one line per page coupled with an illustration does not, to me, constitute a novel). However, despite the adult themes, this book is really more on the reading level of children. The story has little depth that we get to see and the characters aren't developed at all. I realize that the pictures are supposed to do most of the talking but they aren't even that good. In fact, I found them pretty unappealing. This was an enormous letdown after The Time Traveler's Wife. I read The Three Incestuous Sisters (and, by the way, how are they incestuous?) in under three minutes standing in the aisle at the bookstore. If you're hesitant about spending close to thirty dollars on this, I recommend you do the same."
5,"Beautiful, Moving, Gothic, but Simple Visual Poetry!!!","I love this book......I read it at the store and had to have it. The illustrations are beautiful, insightful and very well done. I am mainly writing this in response to the last reviewer and could not believe what ignorant things they had to say. A child could not do these illustrations, and I am very sorry this person missed the entire point of the book. The book is an experience, the size is perfect. Spend some time with it. Its a bit like a silent film. Its similar to the work of Edward Gorey and Gustav Klimt. Anyone who appreciates simplicity, poetry, art and illustration art will love it."
3,pictorial story,"the story is a bit weird and the artwork is gloomy.....this is not to say that is bad artwork, just not my type.....the artwork does a great job at depicting the sisters' lonely life."
3,Unexpected...,"The Three Incestuous Sisters, by Audrey Niffenegger (best-selling author of The Time Traveler's Wife) wasn't what I hoped it would be. I thought the story, which amounts to maybe 3 pages of large text, double-spaced, was a bit weak. Not weak in that it was uninteresting or trite; weak as in it was more of a beginning than an end. It needed to be worked a bit more. Kneaded and massaged and seasoned. Still, the effort, time, and skill that went into it are obvious. Maybe I just need more time to let it grow on me."
2,Just goes to show...,"Weak. There's not any incest in it, not that that's a BAD thing, but c'mon - read the title. Why the reference? Is this a marketing ploy?? HELLO!! A simple illustrated read for adults, I was compelled to pull it off the shelf and then finished it in a few minutes ... but I found it floppy; only mildly interesting, and the illustrations, while nifty, were, well, nifty. Bummer, as well, to see another story where the girls are cruel to one another."
2,Ugh,"What a disappointment after The Time Traveler's Wife! This book is basically a grown-up version of a child's picture book. The illustrations look like something that my neighbor's 3-year-old could put out and the story is just as bad. It took me approximately 90 seconds to read the story, which is mostly about one of the sisters' jealousy over another's relationship with a new beau, and the whole time I was just trying to figure out what the heck was going on. Plus, the book itself is cumbersome, very large and awkward to hold. Definitely not something that looks like it took 13 years, or however long it was, to put together: in fact, it looks like something that was slapped together a week before it was sent to the publisher. Most upsetting after the wonderful story of Time Traveler!"
2,hmmmmm,"I hate to say it but I think had Niffenegger not written the best-selling ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" that this book would have never been published. There were several images I liked very much, in particular when Clothilde communes with her unborn nephew and the drawing where birds circle her head each with a strand of her hair in their beaks which reminded me of Frida Kahlo, but this book seems more like uninspired ""outsider art"" than anything else. Niffenegger writes at the end of the book that she wrote ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" when she should have been working on ""Sisters."" All I can say is that I hope she decides to write a sequel to ""Sisters"" and then interrupts that project to write another incandescent novel like ""The Time Traveler's Wife."""
3,not what I expected,"but then again, what should you expect when you know that the author is going in a completely different direction from her previous work? I loved Time Traveler's Wife, like many people, and I was excited about the prospects of a new Niffenegger book. Still, I knew that it was going to be different; I just didn't know how different. The problem with this isn't that it's different. Three Incestuous Sisters is a decent little Gothic-esque story, with a few strange forays into magical realism territory, but in the end, it just feels like a let down. The images are interesting, but as a whole, the book doesn't hold up. It should be evocative but settles in at curious. Worth a quick look I suppose."
4,haunting,"This is a lovely, hauntingly drawn illustrated novel about three sisters who love the same man. It is a story of passion, jealousy, and devotion, along with regret and forgiveness. It is obvious that the author of the Time Traveler's Wife is an accomplished artist along with her fine narrative talents. I recommend this book highly."
4,"Fun, and a Little Kraftwerk-ish","I finally decided to spill my precious clams and purchase 808 Bit. I am an Apoptygma Berzerk fan and I thought this would be a great way to see a sort of lighter side of Stephen Groth.I am really enjoying this album as it is fun and very synthy. I just wish there weren't so many electronic vocals because I really like Grothesk's voice left alone.After a couple of spins I feel that this album has a hint of some early Kraftwerk to it, but that could just be my opinion. As a whole though it is a good album and well worth the spilled clams."
3,ow my toe,"I got these boots because I was hoping that they would be heavy duty so I wouldn't hurt my big toe when kicking the shifter. I ride in a lot of city traffic. There is not much more protection for my toe than wearing tennis shoes. Also, the toe box of the left boot is now dented in and all dinged up from shifting. I have found these boots to be very inflexible for walking around and I trip over them easily. In the pluses, they are easy to get on and off, and I like the look. I would not particularly recommend them. However, they are my first motorcycle boots, so I have no basis of comparison."
1,Very Stiff,"Loved the look of this boot. Needed something new when riding motorcyle. Looked good on but, unfortunately, this boot failed to deliver on function. This boot is extremely stiff. Could not flex foot at all. Felt like wearing ice skates or snow board shoes. Furthermore, there was room in toe box so I know the boot fit but I could not lace them up properly without the boot itself hurting my foot and I have a thin to average size foot. Would not recommend at all."
4,FEVER TREE/ANOTHER TIME ANOTHER PLACE,"A worthwhile collection to own if you like 60s psychedelic music.As the title says their first 2 lps on one cd,plus their singles they released.The cd comes with a booklet telling the history of the group.The only thing I found dissapointing was, they have included only the radio edit of Sanfransisco girls which has not been mastered very well and lacks something compared the the full version and you can tell this when you listen to this paticular track on this cd."
2,one good song and then nada,"""San Francisco Girls"" is the song they're known for, and it still sounds good -- the sustaining guitar hits an incredible note and holds it almost like something you might hear by My Bloody Valentine. But thereafter, the lead guitar disappears, and we get awful, almost Spinal Tap level attempts at being ""deep,"" with way too much production, nary a beat or a riff in sight. Maybe smoking a little too much Maui Wowee made them try to be Kalil Ghibran. And their cover medley of the Beatles is unredeemed -- they leave out the hooks! Of historical interest only, I'm sad to say."
3,Get the Song Title Correct,"First of all the song was titled ""San Franciso Girls"" not the Beach Boys ""california Girls"". I had all the albums back in the 70'sStill looking for a CD version of Alice Cooper's ""Pretties For You"". Anybody know where I can get one?"
4,My hat's off to Neil,"I've always found a good way to find new music is to find out who the bands you listen to enjoy. So when I came across a reference to this band in Neil Peart's book Roadshow I decided to look them up and wound up buying the album. All I can say is ""Thanks Neil!"" This is a solid and thoroughly enjoyable band. While they may have not been at the forefront of the psychedelia movement they are certainly worth a listen. The material runs from bluesy guitar driven tracks to laid back piano pieces, with horns, strings,and organ adding jazz and classical touches. At his heaviest the vocalist could have fronted Deep Purple, while in his softer moments I hear a touch of Neil Diamond. Most of the material is original, but they cover the likes of Wilson Pickett and the Beatles. The end result is an album that doesn't quite make the A list, but certainly shouldn't be forgotten."
4,Live in Lake Charles,"I've had the fortune to hear the ""Fever Tree"" live and still cannot get their haunting sound out of my mind. I'am 50 years old and still listen to this album. I have one of the original LPs of this group when it was first released. If you enjoy 60's rock, you'll love this one. email me if you'r a Fever Tree fan, twilliamson@ggc.com"
4,"A fun, wild ride.","Fever Tree was a group without an identity, and they never made it big. Still, they were outstanding musicians and their music provides a wild, fun ride back to the crazy early seventies."
3,Dated but Ambitious for Its Time,"I can remember where I was, who I was, and what I was doing when ""San Francisco Girls"" came blasting out of the car stereo. This is still a great song, and worth the purchase price. Unfortunately, this disc features the version which was edited for radio and is missing a verse! Anyone who got used to listening to the complete version will notice the gap, and it's annoying. Hopefully another compilation will be reissued at some point.Although this material sounds pretty dated, it shows a lot of effort. The guitar sound, which uses a lot of sustain, sounds very much like Randy California's work with Spirit, whose first record was released about the same time as this one."
5,"Get the ""Fever"" !!! The first two Fever Tree albums are now on one little CD!!!","Time to get the ""Fever""!!! Fever Tree that is!!! What an awesome compilation!!! Contains Fever Tree's first two LP's (Fever Tree and Another Time Another Place) on a single CD!!! Quite a bargain for two great rare claasic rock gems!!! And the sound quality is superb!!! Over an hour of absolute classic rock and roll!!!( ""San Francisco Girl""s is an all-time classic!!!) A great spin!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+"
3,Good 1st start,"John's CD is a good 1st effort. I dig most of the tunes, but his playing is a little off at times. I wouldn't call it ""fusion"" either...more like melodic pop rock. He misses the beat a lot when he's soloing...but his tunes make up for it. I bet he gets better on the next effort."
1,"3 Discs, Why?","I bought this DVD for only 21.99 (on sale) and even that was too much. His last DVD in Concert was much better. I expected the same, but this DVD did not deliver. The 2 bonus disks are worthless and boring."
2,What was that?!,"Ok now when I think Usher I think ABS! I think Chest! I think great dancing. When I watched this concert I got nothing. For anybody out there who was hoping to see him like he his in his videos, you are out of luck. This was horrible. If you want to hear the songs listen to the cd. He takes of his shirt ONCE!! the dancing was mediocre. Try out the 8701 concert it's hot, or better yet try out the Michael Jackson Bucharest concert and get the originator instead of the imitator. Don't waste your money on this, Unless you are a die hard fan."
1,Are you kidding???,Just received this product and will be returning. It is so small it will only fit a child. Not happy at all.
1,Amazon should be more serious about Product Warranty,"I bought this product last Dec 2009 and stopped working 3 months after.I wrote several times to Amazon regarding the product warranty and they simple said I should contact VAIO. VAIO told me to get back to Amazon.Few questions that I ask myself: Who sold the product? AMAZON, Who charged my credit card? AMAZON; Who deliver the product? AMAZON, who must respond for the product warranty? AMAZON.It has been 2 weeks since the adapter broke down and I am unable to get a response from either AMAZON or VAIO, and of course my VAIO battery is flat and I cannot use the laptop anymore.I hope I could get some decent respond from AMAZON soon."
1,Enormously large and heavy,"This is an adapter that comes with Sony F series laptops.It is enormously large -- the volume and weight of half a small netbook. Twice as big as a Thinkpad T60 adapter and 3 times as big as Asus UV30 one. We're not talking little percentage points.If you never move your laptop, this shouldn't bother you, but if you intend to carry it, the adapter will make its enormous gigantic presence noticeable. At least you won't be able forget it easily.If it was a power adapter for a laundry machine, it'd be great, but for a laptop... not so much."
4,Disturbingly good,"The main topic of the book is one that shouldn't be taken lightly, however it is written in such a way that it is enjoyable to read and riveting at the same time. It makes you think about the topic at hand in a certain way that you probably shouldn't, and then leads you to question if you should have thought about it in that way to begin with.Its a topic that is very disturbing, but has been written so beautifuly, with great humor and sensitivity. Great read."
1,All around bad,This book is about offering facile stereotypes to a specific type of reader. The book lacks literary intellect and is very hard to complete. The author would have been better served by writing a two page short about a coming of age story. There simply is not enough in here for a full length novel.
1,average,This book was a missed opportunity. I would have loved to see less standard villains and more real characters. Some of the writing was not bad.
1,Not in any way about Arab-American culture,"I thought this book would address cultural tensions for a girl caught between Arab and American parents. It is a sexually graphic novel that had no need for an Arab-American ribbon to run through the narrative. I feel the false 'Arab' inclusion was a marketing ploy to increase interest in what is basically an American story with no extra culture involved. Really disappointing. The main character could have been named 'Jessica' rather than 'Jasira' and there would have been no impact on the story line with regards to her background or upbringing. Also, Lebanese do not identify themselves as North Africans, so the Arab authenticity of the father immediately lost credibility with this reader."
2,"Tell me more, show me less","Erian's teenage protagonist, Jasira, manages 300 pages of first-person narration without revealing much at all about herself except that it feels good to press her legs together. Here we have a 13-year-old girl in a precocious body who turns the heads of grown men, yet seems to live in a social and cultural vacuum. Gee, it would have been fun to get her take on Texas middle-schoolers! But no, what we get is a girl so shy she can't buy her own tampons yet tells her boyfriend she wants to have an orgasm. In every scene, she tells us who sits in which chair (like a stage director) but provides no clue about motivation or context; she lets things happen. Fine, you might say, she's only 13. Yes, but the author isn't 13. She's pushing actors onto a stage, winding them up, and watching them bump into each other. Maybe that's why this reads more like a science report than a novel. A flawed science report at that, since author Erian manages to situate Lebanon in North Africa."
1,Badly written,"For the kind hype it received, this is a surprisingly badly written novel. The representation of the Lebanese character is so misinformed it verges on the laughable. The author obviously has no knowledge of Lebanese society."
1,A mediocre novel.,"I purchased ""towelhead"" based on the review I saw in the new york times. This book does not aim for good literature, it only has sales in mind. The novel is packed with cliches and stereotypical situations that use hype and the current interest in the middle east to sell. The book is lightweight and seems to have a couple of intentionally designed ""controvertial"" ideas that are the core of the sales pitch. The book is then fattened up with fillers for the rest of the story to justify those flimsy core ideas. It is surprising a novel of this low a caliber is even mentioned in any newspaper reviews."
3,disturbing,"The book itself was okay. I guess what I have to keep in mind is that this is from a young woman's perspective. Its just perplexing some of the absurd and crazy decisions that she made. It just made me want to find her and shake her. But if that is what the writer was trying to do, she did a good job."
1,Disappointing,"Through the love of my life who is Lebanese, I have read some memorable books about Lebanese characters :::: Beirut Fragments, By Jean Said Makdesi, Koolaids by Rabih Alameddine, and Sitt Marie-Rose by Etel Adnan. Towelhead did not measure up. the main disappointment I had with Ms. Erian's Book is her clearcut intention at creating controversy which is sensation-worthy. I also noticed some poor grammar and a few sections in need of some serious editing."
5,"A Painful, Beautiful Coming of Age Story","Towelhead is one of the best books I have read this year. It's powerful and raw, telling the story of thirteen year-old Jasira, a girl who is abused sexually, emotionally, and physically by nearly everyone in her life. While it could have easily strayed into a dark and hopeless place, the author manages to keep it hopeful and even retain a modicum of Jasira's innocence.The book is written from Jasira's perspective and the narrative feels authentically thirteen without being irritatingly thirteen. As the reader, one often cringes at the bad choices Jasira makes but still always roots for her. This novel is stunning, moving, and I found myself unable to put it down."
2,Not worth it,"This is the story of Jasira, who at age 13 is sent to live with her Lebanese dad in Houston, after her mom found out Jasira was having ""an improper relationship"" with her boyfriend.This story mixes racism, teenage sexual self discovery and rape. I didn't find it that attractive, I find it hard to feel anything towards Jasira except pity and frustration. I do think that the characters were somewhat cliche: selfish mother, strict and violent dad from the Middle East, teenage girl obsessed with sex, abusive neighbor, and tolerant and savior-type American young woman. Overall I would not recommend this book unless you want to read about the specific issues."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. The ideas were not new and the coverage was very superficial. This could be forgiven if there wasn't such a clear bias in the book. There were shades of bias in the early chapters, but as the book moved into the more modern elections it became clear that Shogan has a serious axe to grind. His coverage of the 2000 election is particularly skewed. His disdain for President Bush is quite evident. An example of this disdain can be found in his summary of the 2000 election from page 243: ""Here was the governor of Texas, possessed of slim credentials, a nondescript intellect, and an underwhelming persona running a nose ahead of the incumbent vice president of an administration that had presided over a time of unparalleled prosperity. What's wrong with this picture?"""
2,Entertaining but biased,"It was great fun to relive the details of Presidential campaigns from 1968 to the present, and the objective facts presented were well written. But the author skewed the ""Bad News"", overemphasizing Republican media victories and completely forgetting about certain unfair biases against Republicans (i.e. 1992 Iran Contra disclosures three days before the general election). Shogan really goes over the top in railing against the image of Gore 2000 as ""the great exaggerator"". There really were many good parts, but this man is obviously still angry about George W. Bush winning the Presidency, and it shows."
4,An interesting story,"As his tentative fiance abandons him for not having achieved enough worldly success, the major / captain proves himself to be the bravest, most intelligent and least hot-headed of all of the cavalry. There's some suspense, humor, action, etc. Ironically enough, over on AllRovi.com they say this is one of the more historically accurate of all the movies about Sitting Bull. During the viewing I was assuming I would find this film was way off from actual history and was surprised by that statement. Whether it is true or not, I could not say.The guy who plays U.S. Grant is a good choice--dignified and stately. So is the actor playing Sitting Bull--I think they made a good choice with him too. Overall I'd say it made for a good watch. I didn't buy this DVD... I just VCR'd it on ThisTV and it may be from the same source as the DVD since it seemed slightly out of focus sometimes and a little grainy. But not bad enough that I stopped watching."
3,historical and entertaining,"This was probably one of the better videos recounting the battleof the little big horn. Only the men involved in this historicalevent know for sure what happened, but this seems as close asany video I've seen, compared to what has been written. Dale Robertson did a magnificent job in his role as the major whotries to find justice for the indians. I haven't seen Robertson in many romantic roles such as this. Mary Murphy becomes Mrs. Robertson in real life for a short short time in 1956. I would recommend this video if you like westerns."
2,VHS quality,"the movie is good, but the quality isn't that good, It's like you watch a VHS tape. Definitely I wouldn't recommend this DVD."
1,"i don't know about sitting,but this is bull !","amazing how a movie about sitting bull can have a white man as the star and the title man is really just a costar! as history this worthless and as adventure it does a little better,but not much!the print here is very bad,with sound drops and some scenes are so washed out as to be unwatchable! i know you sould not expect a great copy at such a cheep price,but you should be able to watch it!!!!! skip it!"
1,interesting,"Just watched this on TCM. It is amazing that somebody made a movie where President Grant and Sitting Bull were going to sit down together between the two armies and discuss peace, but that Custer screwed the whole thing up on purpose by disobeying orders and attacking the indians while Grant was waiting to be taken to the meeting place. It is certainly sympathetic to the indians, and a bit ahead of its time in 1954 in this respect. Sitting Bull chides one of his braves not to scalp Custer because we do not scalp brave men who died in battle. I recommend that you watch ""Little Big Man""."
5,sitting bull,was pleased with dvd recived sooner than i expected will recomend to all your coustomers.thank you virginia
2,Its All Hype,This book is an AOL marketing ploy to enocurage how spectacular AOL is and really lacks any useful substance. The must-know tips and such are easily found elsewhere and there is no need to read the book.
5,awsome cd,"Great guitar player, and a great cd, good taste for music and a good songwhiter. Overall an awsome cd..."
5,The fundamentals,"Anyone with any interest in error reduction, or in the way humans interact with technology should start here. The psychological analysis of how and why we commit errors is fascinating, and influences the way one thinks about daily events. I find myself saying ""Aha, that was a capture error,"" and ""Damn! I've fallen for the fundamental attribution error again."" The real lesson is that errors derive from the very nature of human behavior--the mechanisms which enable us to solve complex problems also make errors inevitable. This realization changes entirely one's concept of industrial accidents and medical mistakes."
4,Basic reading on the subject,"For those who are interested in the study of humen error and confiability based on a cognitive approach, this is a basic reading! For those longing for a more comprehensive approach, it is only the first step. But it's worthwhile."
4,A lot of inspiration!,"This album is a combination of some very popular songs you might know. It is arranged for the guitar and it is very inspirational. However, some songs are a little boring. I like the last song and the first songs. To bad there is know pianos in this album. :)"
1,Painful,Listening to this album made me wish I could throw John Tesh's guitar IN the fire. The arrangements were not particularly innovative or enjoyable. Don't waste your money.
1,Terrible,"You know the saying, ""You get what you paid for""? It applies to this bra.I was excited to find an inexpensive nursing bra as they generally run $40+. I should have known that this price was too good to be true.The band on this bra runs very small. The cups are big and unflattering. Think grandma bra. This is getting returned asap"
3,Good for one season only,"I left this shade tent up all summer in the shade of a tree by my pool. It was a great success, but the other day in a wind storm it ripped to shreds. I realized that the material had turned to the consistency of paper. Clearly it was not designed to be left up all the time for a few months, which is a shame because the design otherwise is perfect."
4,Kinda like watching poker on TV only in book form.,"If you like watching poker tournaments on TV then I think you will like this book. I read Phil Gordon's Little Green Book and really liked the segments where he described actual hands that he had played in the past and how they turned out, good or bad. I actually wanted more of that and this book is exactly that, more play by play action. I like the format and the way he gives you the opportunity to think about what you would do given the information he had at each turn of the hand. It is sort of like a practice book for what you may have learned in the Little Green Book. I definitely think you need to read the Green Book first."
3,A fun but light read,"Phil Gordon comes across like a fun guy to know and his hand descriptions are entertaining. But while these tales do contain insights, it is just disappointing compared to the dense-pack of detailed hand-analysis of Dan Harrington's books or the detailed theoretical work of David Sklansky.What Gordon does do is communicate the concepts in a user-friendly ""bumper sticker"" manner. That might be more effective for some readers and I don't mean the bumper-sticker appellation as a put-down. Poker is played in real-time, without notes and calculators, and a KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid) memory system will help many players.But no offense to Phil, Harrington is the gold standard."
3,Better when he's not doing solo stuff,"I love Larry Carlton. Heck, he's one of the reason's why I want to learn guitar. I have hit ""Last Night"" album and it's great. I heard his work with others in collaboration. I absolutely love his work in Fourplay. For some strange reason, Larry just doesn't cut it as a solo artist. I tried Finger Prints, Deep Into It, and now this. While some tracks are great, he just sounds ""bored"" with solo efforts. Want to hear some Larry, pick up the latest Fourplay albums."
3,Smooth blues,"Blues has been so absorbed into the musical main stream, so exploited and explored that there's no way to get out of the cliche. So why not embrace it and play every cliche in the book?This is blues to go with your double latte with extra sugar. To me this music has all the appeal of processed cheese. Slick, squeaky-clean music performed with the surgical precision of a studio ace.Yes Carlton sounds good. He's a great player. (and Michael Rhodes bass sounds darn good too) So settle in. It may be the best blues you ever went to sleep to."
3,"Sorry Folks, this isn't it!","I hate to rain on the parade here, but this CD doesn't do it for me. Way too sterile. The blues, be it jazz/blues has to have some grit to it. This doesn't. Listen to some Grant Green or Kenny Burell. Sorry Larry, your a great side man/collaborator. This one doesn't make it."
4,Fine Collection of Original Blues Ditties,"With so many disappointments in modern music, Larry Carlton came through with the real blues on this new CD. Thank you Larry. Each song has a different feel and approach. All of them have the classic sound of Larry's Gibson 335. In addition to fine blues playing, Larry must have included about 25 guitar tricks within the tracks. He is one clever guy. This is a fine CD worth the money. I would have given it 5 stars if he had a bit more muscle in his guitar tone.Also, if you haven't purchased a copy yet, PLEASE do yourself a big favor and buy Larry's ""On Solid Ground"" CD. It will make your fur stand up !"
2,Didn't Buy,"I've been a fan of LC's since his first album, and I used to buy albums and CD's without review. But after buying a few that just didn't do it for me, I'm a little more carefull. I went through the samples...of course the first song is all sax. Who chooses these samples?! I want to hear Larry! I went through the other samples and I just didn't hear the technical smoothness that I like. Maybe I'm just not a big blues fan. I really prefer Larry's work on the Four-Play CD's."
1,Preaching Christianity is the bottom line here.,"I became aware of Dr. Reker's conservative outlook by statements such as, sex before marriage is illegal in South Carolina, so Susan Smith was breaking the law. He also describes things subjectively, as in, ""tawdry sexual exploits"". As the book continues, he brings in religion more and more. The last 1/4 of the book is sheer preaching. It is a sermon. He talks about Jesus dying on the cross for our sins... I felt decieved by the fact that the title and cover of the book did not say that it is written with a Christian perspective. An apt title would be, ""The Christian Interpretation of the Susan Smith Case."" If that's what you want, buy the book. If not, look elsewhere."
2,Not Very Good...,"This book would be for any girl that hasn't been on a date... I've been on many dates, so this wasn't helpful to me at all."
5,Meditation on the Purpose Driven Life,It was purchased as a gift and was accepted with joy. Shipping was prompt. Product was as advertised.
5,Wilton Tureen,Great value. Box was damaged but not the item itself. Wilton pieces are so versatile. This was a gift and well received.
4,Review of Suddenly by Barbara Delinsky,"I find most of Barbara Delinsky's books extremely well written and entertaining and this book was no exception. I had a hard time putting this down at night. I wanted to keep reading to find out what was happening next. I believe if you like Barbara Delinsky's writing, you'll love this one."
2,Didn't hit the mark.,"I always look forward to Barbara Delinsky's books, have always enjoyed them. But Suddenly just didn't make it for me....it was drawn out, at times it rambled without connection....frankly, it was pretty boring. Which was a big surprise for me - she usually writes wonderful books, full of interesting characters and thought provoking plots....this just wasn't one of them. I'll still continue to buy her books!"
2,Small means s m a l l,"I have a very small cat with short legs and she barely fits in this bed. With it's tall sides, she has trouble getting into it. I now use it as a toy 'box'. It IS well made, very warm and washable, but I wish it was a bit wider."
4,Good overview for the popular audience of quantum physics,"A very good overview, written for the popular audience, of quantum physics, originally written in 1982, by physicist Heinz Pagels. The first part of the book deals with the history of the subject. The second part, the (then) newer stuff, including complex subjects like Bell's Theorem. Unfortunately, since Pagels died in a mountaineering accident in 1988, there hasn't been an update of the book (because of the speed of the scientific discovery, even the best science books can get quickly outdated). That's why the newer stuff in physics, mainly string theory, is not covered here. Still, a very good book."
2,"This is a great book on Quantum Physics, you just have to get past the Authors personal views on God","This is a really good book on Quantum Physics. I really want to give it 5 stars, but the draw back is that the Author is constantly injecting his views about God into book, which at times is very distracting. The book is good because it guides you through both the history of Quantum Physics, as well as its core concepts. If the Author is still alive, I hope that he will choose to release a new edition of this book that speaks to the new developments, discoveries and theories that have occured since the original publication of the book in the 1980's."
3,Good Movie,"Though it's dated it still holds up to some of the films they are cranking out now. Besides, I am a Richard Harris fan."
3,Loosly based on Historical Figure,"Man in the Wilderness is a loose interpretation of an actual Mountain Man experience. Read ""The Saga of Hugh Glass"" for the actual account of a wilderness survival story."
5,Take this with you to your club!,"This book is easy to read, comprehensive, and accompanied by instructive photographs. It even shows you what not to do! I think this should be required reading for any person about to begin weight training. They should be sold at all facilities with weight training equipment to enable clients to maximize their efforts!"
1,No revolution just uninspired rehashing,"Liked the reviews I read here about this book. After purchasing and reading the book, the reviews are truley misleading. Content which is meager has little explanation for nearly any exercise suggested. BAM is better used by Emeril then in this book.Fancy topics like ""Posture and Ergonomics"" once I read it, are nothing more then superficial observations. Telling me how to stand and sit are not training techniques.The chapter on abs has 6 exercises with 2 being used twice one on a bench and one on the floor counting for 4 of the 6.Sadly the reviews sucked for this book. If I had flipped thru the book for just a few seconds I would have passed without a moments hesitation, instead I wasted a few bucks and some time confirming how feeble the book was."
2,Vampire Movie Multipack,I own this set of movies. I only thought that one movie was watchable. Hey don't take my word for it watch it yourself to see if you like it or not. When I think of vampire movies I think of Dracula(1930s) and very few movies afterwards.Dracula (1970s) & Dracula (1990s)Rating 2 out of 5.
3,Good but not entirely practical,The idea behind this product is good but . . . It is not entirely practical. The main problem is keeping it on. It gets too uncomfortable to keep on if you make it tight but it slips off if you make it loose enough to be comfortable.
1,Can't rate it if I've never rec'd the product.,I was told on 12/11/06 this would be backordered and I would not have it by Xmas but shortly thereafter. I still have not rec'd it so I have asked the vendor for a refund instead.Jan S.
5,Squeeze horn,"Good price. It arrived ahead of schedule.Hilarious sound, over and over again.Better than advertised.Easy for me to mount to my handlebars."
4,"sporty, comfort, yet trendy",This shoe is how it appears. With the cushioned sole the impact on your heal and ankles is greatly reduced. The cross-over strap ensures comfort and proper fastening across the foot. All-in-all a terrific buy. And they look good too!
4,"If they are on sale, buy them!","I got them on sale for an excellent price.They breathe well, look nice, hold up decently, and are stylish without being over the top...The piece of leather on the inside moves around a bit, it needs some glue. That's the only complaint though."
1,Useless - cable kinks easily,"As soon as I tried to use this on an easy job clearing out behind a p-trap, the cable immediately kinked and bent in several places. I wasn't even applying much turning force at all. It was useless to continue so I returned this piece of junk. The cable is very weak. Prior to this I had a hand-crank drum auger that was made entirely of metal and it lasted for about 10 years. This Cobra drum auger lasted less than 5 minutes before the cable kinked. I recommend General Pipe Cleaners R-25SM instead, which is built MUCH tougher and still reasonably priced."
4,works when you need,"Today, my toilet was clogged. I am glad I gave this auger a try for the first time. Worked great with my Dewalt power drill. The extra handle on the bottom really is really cool. The lock mechanism on the front is so much easier than the screw type ones. Overall, I unclogged my toilet with this auger and am looking forward to buying another spare. One con of this auger is that there are no holes in the container. Thus, if the auger is wet, I guess the water will have trouble drying out."
3,Speaker cabinet handles,"I thought these babies were a little tougher than that, one of the handles of my speaker bin began to malfunction on the first lift very disappointing. Come on quality control guys the average person hates wasting time. I had to remove this handle immediately because it would rattle too much when the subs are turned up. It has a nice hot dipped look and is made of metal with good rivets just the spring mechanism on one unit broke and now I am nervous about the others. there are better handles out there. two more of the handels are not working properly as I feared."
4,I used this product and while I found ...,"I used this product and while I found it to be a good sudser, the scent was a little too over-powering. I liked using the liquid as opposed to bar soap though. I'd consider using it again, maybe just watering it down a bit."
4,Really nice. I didn't need very much to ...,Really nice. I didn't need very much to work up a good lather and I felt really clean afterwards. Great for shaving also. The only drawback was that the scent was a bit overpowering and stayed with me for a long time. I'd definitely recommend this product.
4,"Well, I handed it over to my husband ...","Well, I handed it over to my husband and he's actually using it. That's a good sign. I think he still prefers bar soap, but the scent is very nice. I tried it one day to see how it was and I think it's just fine. I also prefer bar soap and don't normally buy liquid bath soaps, but this one's nice if you like liquid soaps."
4,Nice CD,This CD is a must have for anyone who loves Morricone. Most songs are very touching. The CD would have been even better if some of the songs were longer.
5,"my sin, my soul, my favorite soundtrack","To me, this is Morricone's best score since BUGSY. The music is moving while watching the film, and it is just as moving when you put on this disc, close your eyes, and melt into the molodious mood of this masterpiece. Your heart will flutter against your ribs, your soul will wrentch inside your body, and your mind will flicker with the images of that one special girl or boy whom has never left the cockles of your blue heart."
5,Beautiful music that mad the movie complete,"There are sparatic 40's style gems amongst the most beautiful new classical music I think I have ever heard as a soundtrack. Track 20 'ladies and gentelmen of the jurry' is a slow, intense theme which will have you thinking about it for months after listening to it. There are a few classical ones that you may skip over because of their direct tie with the movie (they don't really work just as songs.) Overall, the movie was a beautiful rendition of a book of genius, and this soundtrack does both justice."
3,Not Current Enough,"Doesn't have words like ""internet"" or ""world wide web"" or acronyms like ""HTML."" It does have all the swear words, though. Sadly, I already know the definitions for most of those.Also, if you're used to using Webster's pronunciaton symbols, it may take a while to get used to Oxford pronunciation symbols. For example, does it seem intuitive that the symbol ""d3"" would represent the sound of ""j""? How about ""3:"" for ""er""? Or, ""i:"" for ""ee""? I can't even create most of the greek-type characters they use for their pronunciation symbols.Also, wouldn't it be great if these pocket dictionaries saved space by eliminating all the simple words like ""sit,"" ""red,"" ""door,"" etc? Then maybe they'd have room for the words we were trying to look up!"
1,Surprisingly useless,"For a dictionary that claims to have 130,000 entries, this one is missing a lot of words. Here are just a few, none terribly obscure, that it omits: durian, eidetic, entasis, galanga, hermeneutics, ichor, lemongrass, metope, plexiglass, polycarbonate, terpene, thujone. The more I look at it, the worse it gets. This review started at 2 stars."
3,Not Current Enough,"Doesn't have words like ""internet"" or ""world wide web"" or acronyms like ""HTML."" It does have all the swear words, though.

Then maybe they'd have room for the words we were trying to look up!"
4,Relax!,"Relax, people. It is simply a bunch (6) of scripts! It was interesting, though, to see the actual piece of paper that makes ::Voyager:: episodes what they are. Also a good investment if you are thinking about submitting a script to Paramount. It must be in this form for them to accept it!"
4,Oh Seven My Seven,"A great collection of Seven of Nine moments, although I would have liked some images within the book. I have the other two scriptbooks and I find them all worthwhile to read and enjoy. They are all very fast reads, so if you are looking for a book to last you the summer, then these are not it. I read them all in one weekend but they were all very good."
5,Great for people who came into the series late!,"I got into Voyager in the last season, and Seven immediately caught my attention- how did she come to be on Voyager, what was her life like before she was assimilated, ect. This book was great for me since I missed the fourth season, when she came to Voyager. Highly recommended for others in the same situation."
1,Out of date,"Good guide for 1997, but 3 years later it is out of date and does not contain many new sites. Web directorys should be updated yearly at the least."
4,Comfort and Value for Breastfeeding Moms,This QT bra is comfortable enough to sleep in and a value. I have sensitive skin and cannot wear most bras due to the materials they are made of. This one however does not irritate my skin and it is a value. Though it is not as supportive as an underwire you really shouldn't wear and underwire if you are breastfeeding anyway. If you are a small cup like me (B) this will work fine. This is the second one I purchased. They do wear out and lose elasticity like any bra but at this price you can afford to replace them a couple of times.
2,small,"like others said it runs very small...i needed one more inch of band and the cup area is tight, the sling doesn't seem wide enough not to bind"
3,The Fun Didn't Last Long,"I bought Captain Bones for my 6 year old son for Christmas. We played it with his 8 & 3 year old siblings. The initial surprise of the skeleton jumping out caused great excitement, but after a few turns, the thrill was gone.I bought this game based upon the raving reviews here at toysrus.com & must say I totally disagree. It's a good concept, but gameplay isn't fun enough to hold my childrens' interest. If I could go back in time, I would have spent the money on something different."
5,"Surprisingly fun, and for the price, you can't beat it!","My 5 year old son saw the advertisement for this game quite awhile back, and had mentioned it to me. However, in Toys R Us this morning, I happened to see it on the shelf for the QUITE reasonable price of $4.95. I thought it had to be an error! The price was correct, however, and once we got it home, my son (and I) had a terrific time playing with it! So far, we've had no problems with the game, and I'd highly recommend it"
1,dissappointed,"my four year old son couldn't wait to play this game. during the first game, i smelt a burning smell, and the skeleton wouldn't come out of the chest. i got it to work one or two times, but no more. we had to throw it out because we had no receipt for it. my son was very sad."
1,Broke before we could play it!,"My kids just got this game for Christmas yesterday. We put it together, and they goofed around with it, pushing the monkey so the skeleton would come out. Before we could actually sit down to play it, the skeleton was no longer working!"
4,Do not let your child pull on Captain Bones,"This game was a favorite of my 2 boys. We actually returned one that wasn't working so well and purchased another one. My 3 year old was playing with it on his own and now captain bones won't work at all. He must have pulled on him, so don't allow your younger children to play this game unattended. Otherwise, it's a great and fun game!"
1,Do NOT buy,"The concept is great but the manufacturing of it was horrible. The captain pops out and jerks around. It NEVER comes close to any game pieces. Since it was a gift and we don't have the receipt, we can't even return it. Don't waste your money and buy something else. My boys were very disappointed."
2,Kinda Boring,"Our son just got this game for his 5th birthday. He LOVES games & this one was recommended for his age group. He got bored with it after a few minutes. I'm sure we've never finished an entire game because it doesn't keep his interest. We haven't had any of the structural problems that other reviewers mentioned, that game works fine. It's just not fun. You just keep going around in circles. However my son also got the Sponge Bob game of LIFE for the same birthday & asks us to play that all day. Very fun. Buy the Game of Life instead."
4,Fun game but not very sturdy,"I bought this game for my two boys on a Saturday, by Sunday Captain Bones didnt always return to his treasure chest. We would have to push the monkey again just to get him back inside. I exchanged the game for another the following Monday and by the end of the night Captain Bones didnt even come out of his chest.My boys love this game, especially my 3yo who gets a kick out of Captain Bones stealing the gold but its definately not worth the original $20.Overall the game is a lot of fun but it could use a little improvement on its durability."
1,skeleton with a sweatband,I repeatedly tapped the monkey's head but Captain Bones stayed in his treasure chest the whole time!
4,Christy Chung is Mesmerizing!,"I am glad I had seen this movie, because it's Christy Chung breakthrough performance, at the same time it's a very sexually disturbing film which reminded me of Juliette Binoche's Damage. I am not a fan of Christy, but it's amazing to see her transformed herself into a highly sexualized and Westernized stepmother role in this period drama that dealt with issues including abuse, abandonment, abortion, sexual perversion, and revenge in a wealthy Thai household. Also, she not only looked glamorous and beautiful, she also learnt all her lines in Thai. She gets to sleep with the adolence lead and another woman.A few disturbing scenes in this film including the little boy witnessing his father having sex, and the scene when Christy assisted her lover to have an abortion that caused a massive of amount of bleeding.This film is provocative, and can be overwhelming for some mainstream viewers. If you are a fan of Christy Chung, then you should not miss it."
3,Viennese music,"I bought this CD for background music for a special dinner party, and for that purpose it was excellent. Being a musician, I can say that if one wants to be technical, it was not in real Viennese style, but certainly adequate for listening for non-musicians. It did not sound like there were 101 strings, so I wonder about the name of the orchestra."
3,Interesting and sad,"This book is a very interesting and very sad look at what over development and the nouveau riche can do to the beauty, character, and culture of a once-lovely, genteel, semi-rural Eden. Now it's McMansions, ice cream shops, rude drivers, and tacky people."
3,Historical Monograph,"Wonderfully written and researched. Architecturally lacking photographs, drawings, or any substance for inspiration or idea generation. Cover and size of book suggests more pictorial content, but fails to deliver."
2,"Cute, but...","I hadn't seen the UglyDog in person, but ordered it anyway. The pink is not the same shade as the online photo. I really don't like the color of it- it's like an 80s magenta mix, with a little purple and burgundy. I wish I would have bought a different one, but it's still cute."
2,Broke the first day!,"Love this, used it at a Halloween party, but I had to tape it up because it kept tearing. Would not recommend this product unless you are handy with the packing tape."
2,"Broke not long after, but fun while it lasted (which wasn't long)","My son enjoyed it until it broke. Broke after a few uses. Great idea, that it auto inflates, but it simply isn't great quality. I'm not sure if ANY whoopee cushion is ever great quality. He was sad when it broke though, he was having fun with it."
5,Everyone Loves It!,"A great gift for every kid you know! (Plus, their parents won't be able to stop using it either.) Making a whoopie cushion self inflating is genius! We get these at the drug store, and yes, they do wear out rather quickly. But what do you expect for a small price? It's ok, we just buy another."
1,Died in hours,"It worked for all of 1 1/2 hours, and then the plastic developed a second hole in it. Doesn't work now. It's supposed to be designed to withstand being sat on..."
1,Not worth it,As soon as they where used the first time they popped and there it not fixing them...Not what they use to be for sure.
2,Review,"The toy was fun at first, but it did not take long before it broke. The auto inflate was pretty nice, though."
4,It is what it is....,Works great! worth the priced paid for it! :) my son finds it hilerious! I actually bought this as part of a costume.
2,Worked but the cover peeled off very quick!,"This product worked as it says, however the yellow cover started peeling away after about a week. It developed a small tear and it quickly spread. =("
1,JUNK,Go to the Dollar store and buy one there. Those are still 2 weeks later working. This one broke the first day.
2,Whoopee,I liked the idea of it being permanently inflated but it only worked on hard surface chairs. I couldn't get it to work on lightly padded dining room chairs or sofa.
3,OK,"Not what I was expecting. It was ok, but the copy was not done very good!I don't what else to say, but it was a bad record and the sound was not that good."
4,Extremely detailed and a good resource.,"This booklet has step-by-step instructions with diagrams of each step. Included are the specific benefits of each posture as well as who should avoid them due to individual health conditions. It is a great reference source but not practical to use as a walk-thru yoga session, as, frankly, it's hard to do yoga while holding and reading a book. It is well worth the money as a reference source."
5,Babaji's Hatha Yoga Inspiration,"Yoga inspires me to consistently engage in spiritual practice. Almost two decades have passed since I was initiated into Babaji's Kriya Yoga. This complete yoga encompasses kriya hatha yoga, kundalina pranayama (breathing practices), kriya dhyana yoga (meditation), kriya mantra yoga (chants), and kriya bhakti yoga (devotion and service).Babaji's Kriya Hatha Yoga provides a full body massage externally and internally. These poses quiet my mind and relax my spirit to experience my work and relationships with equanimity and patience.Although I am not an athletic hatha yoga practitioner, I can attest to the enduring benefits of continuous and consistent hatha yoga practice. Babaji's kriya hatha yoga has given me a healthy body, purified my heart, and stabilized my mind for meditation.Hatha yoga poses unite me with earth's grounding energy that flows through my chakras like an invisible pulse connecting me to the eternal emptiness that binds us all."
2,A poorly prepared book,"When learning new movements with which one is not familiar, it helps if there are accompanying explanations. You will not find any such explanations in this book."
3,To Small!,"Small, difficult to view demo drawings. The quality of materials & printing require delicate handling or booklet print wears off. System presented and step by step pose prompts are excellent. Would like to see this material in a larger, higher quality format."
4,Going to London,My fiance is just learning to cook and moving to London ... this DVD was the perfect gift since it gives the vibes of British culture while at the same time teaching how to shop and cook on the London streets. Great buy! She loved it.
2,Most overrated blues musician,"Muddy Waters should be given a lot of credit for essentially being the first major blues figure to use electric guitar and a backup band. However, that doesn't even begin to justify the almost godlike admiration many blues fans have for him. I'm sorry, but I've just never been able to get into the man's music. Granted, ""Hoochie Coochie Man"" is a classic, but that's as much for Little Walter's harmonica work as anything else. Also, this is a very poor compilation of his work. They left out most of his best stuff- ""Just Want to Make Love"", ""Got my Mojo Working"", ""I'm Ready"", and ""Rolling Stone"" are all superb works by Muddy, and all of them are absent here. It's not that there's anything wrong with his music, in fact much of it is quite good, just don't expect it to live up to the legendary name of Muddy Waters."
3,Made in China... not USA,"I was disappointed when I received the 3 mugs I purchased. Not in the mugs themselves which met my expectations.The boxes each one came the story of tumbleweed pottery and how it had grown as a family business across generations. It painted a picture as the ""producer"" but in context gave the impression of a local manufacturer of product. There were no labels indicating the country of origin on the box which normally means one can expect the product to be made in the USA.When I opened the boxes and removed the mugs I was surprised to see a little ""made in China"" sticker. I got a buy-2-get-1-free deal, which was nice, but I thought I was supporting American manufacturing.I'm not planning on returning these. The mugs are what I wanted and they are very nice.I hope that tumbleweed will consider bringing manufacture of these good mugs back to the USA or at least make it clear where products are manufactured."
4,"Interesting & worthwhile, but very academic","I was led to this book by John Opsopaus' superb ""Pythagorean Tarot,"" wherein he mentions that Kingsley demonstrated that Empedocles was a shaman (""iatromantis,"" that is). Everything said about this book so far is true: It *is* an interesting and valuable read; it *is* highly technical; and Kingsley definitely takes on every other classical scholar in clearing the air, removing historical debris and cultural bias, and establishing a new standard of personal involvement in classical scholarship. My take is that one can get the gist of his conclusions in chapters 15 & 19 (and perhaps 20 & 22), without wading through all the scholarly minutae. This groundwork was probably necessary to remove the blinders from our collective eyes imposed by an earlier generation of Greek scholars overly wowed by science and strangely detached from personal experience. In the end, I look forward to reading Kingsley's ""Dark Places of Wisdom."""
3,little known horror story,"I actually watched 3 of these movies over the weekend. the original was pretty crazy and i didn't quite get what this was all about until i saw the 2nd movie (replay) and then it made more sense..I actually liked the 3rd one (rebirth) more..there is another one that looks like some kind of t.v. movie, which i didn't want to see, but the last one from 2005 called forbidden fruit looks pretty good and will be watching that one this weekend...it just so happens all 5 are at my local video store along with some better jhorror and khorror movies (such as one missed call and face)"
5,Tomie... the girl who never dies!,These movies are great! This is about a girl named Tomie. She will never die. She never dies.
5,Amazing Fascinating Flamenco,"This book is incredible!! It contains a treasure of different styles of flamenco pieces. I absolutely wish there were more like this out there, that explain the techniques and styles, and then incorporate the idioms of flamenco in every piece. I recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn some sexy, inspiring, hot flamenco!!!"
1,NOT for chilling!,"Loud, obnoxious, clanky and annoying. Maybe a good one for getting yourself up and at 'em after a night of revelry, but trying to chill with this playing is like trying to wind down with 4 pots of espresso."
1,Training in Egyptian Paganism,Tries to get children to imagine being a child in ancient Egypt. Talks about praying to Egyptian gods and goddesses and includes activities on making up spells and carving idols.
4,By any other name,"A 3.5mm Stereo Jack To 1/4"" Stereo Plug Adapter by any other name would be just the same, but can you get it at a better price than at Amazon.com? I think not!"
5,Standard plug,"The plug is of good quality and works as expected. It isn't flashy or have gold connectors, but if you just need an adapter this will do the trick. I don't expect to have any problems with it."
1,Never Worked,Terrible. Never worked for me. Not worth it. Never a clear signal. I had to shove the 1/8th cable into the adapter and it never worked.
1,Do not Order,"unless you only want one ear of your headphone to work.I ordered 12, and they all had the same problem, to some degree or another. One or two of them, if i twisted and turned and pulled in and out over and over, until a stereo sound was found, and then we tried not to touch it.I used multiple different headphones, so i know it was just how cheap and light these were that caused the problem. they are not made from quality components."
4,Great light,"These Eclipse lights are great for evening computer work; less glare than a room light. Bulbs are hard to replace, though - I've only found them online."
4,Interesting and unusual approach,This book provides an interesting approach to the problem of mixed-initiative dialog systems. The example is always present and helps to understand. It describes a prolog-based task oriented dialog system in which the missing axiom paradigm is used to reach the goal of each dialog system : make the user happy. Really interesting and helpful ...
5,the Perfect Book,"The Voice of the Tree was just the book I have been waiting for, it blended mystical history and adventure perfectly. I also loved the relation to hockey!"
2,Iles can do better,"This novel requires that the readers suspend disbelief. I was appalled at the ""romance"" between a middle-aged physician and a 17-year old girl and, additionally, the coy interaction between the baby-sitter and main character. I can't believe I finished it, although the legal wrangling was often interesting. I think there was not enough effort made to make the characters believable - the main character's girlfriend was nothing short of sleazy, which is perhaps an apt description of much of this book. I hope that Iles has done and can do better. Somehow I can't see myself reading another one of his books until the memory of this one fades."
5,Great Book,"Really gives you a feel for Natchez, even if you've never been there. Great followup to The Quiet Game, though you can read this one independently. Narration was great (audio version)."
1,Blame the victim.....,"This is the first book I have read by Greg Iles and the last. The running theme seems to be that l7 and 18 year old girls are stalking and lusting after men in their forties. As the story drags on, it is increasingly obvious that Mia is after poor Penn who valiantly attempts to treat her the way he treats his 9 year old daughter. This may be Mr. Iles fantasy, but it is laughable. I got as far as Mia, (18 years old), with her eyes locked on his, asking him (43 years old) to give her another hug but something stops him. I had to give up at that point. I may attempt to finish it one day, but I am sure that Drew (40 years old) will come out of it unpunished and lily white after being victimized and taken advantage of by Kate (17 years old."
2,Don't Bother,"I haven't read a book this bad in years. I skimmed the last 150 pages. The plot develops into a story so unbelievable, it became laughable. I couldn't believe it managed to include not one but two story lines involving hot teenage babysitters attracted to middle age men. Who are these people? I have limited time to read pleasure books so I have to choose very carefully. If you fall into that category - skip this one!"
5,turning angel,I have read all of the Penn Cage mysteries and it is important to read them in order.As are all of his books this one ranks a 5 ! He is the best mystery writer we have today.
5,"Love, love, love Greg Iles!","Terrific author who keeps me up late at night because I have to see what happenes next! Penn Case is great and look forward to reading more where he is the central character. Iles weaves and personalizes each character in his quiet little setting, so one cannot predict how the book will end. Some chapters make me think, ""Wow! I didn't see that coming!"" Very enjoyable to read.... keep 'em commin' Mr. Iles!"
4,"This Book Defines ""Pageturner""","First, Turning Angel is a real page turner, but suprisingly to me, it also has a lot of content outside of murder and mayhem. The author makes some really incisive observations about life in the South. So, why four stars rather than five ? I found the protagionist's getting away from one of the bad guys near the end of the book kind of hard to swallow.Otherwise, great read."
3,over the top,"The story is well written with lots of different threads nicely working in tandem, but the bottom line for me was that the author tried so hard to be shocking that he lost credibility. I got tired of people being shot and blown up and otherwise in jeopardy. I think the teen sex thing was exploited for purposes of the story (yes, I know kids today are different. I've got two of my own -- but the entire senior class of an elite school does not act as Iles would have us believe). What's more, pain killers are readily available over the Internet, so the idea of people killing and being beholden to drug pushers for something they could buy with the click of a mouse, didn't ring true. These are just a few examples of the many things that irritated me in reading and thus kept me from being drawn into what could have been a very good story about human nature."
4,A real page turner,"Not quite as good a Blood Memory and Mortal Fear, but up there with his best. A real page turner, I did nothing today except finish this book. Greg Iles characters are those you would like to meet and would be your friends. I hope he write a sequel, I would like to know what transpires in Penn and Annie's life."
4,4 1/2 *s Definitely a suspenseful thriller with a lot of meat on,its bones. It is skillfully written and though complicated Iles weaves his way through the tale with his usual expertise.It is amazing how as you read this truly mind-captivating novel; you slowly begin to realize how much of the innocense is gone in our young people. It's not that we don't know that...it is just that here it is in black and white...it is explicit and starkly realistic. And sometimes it is like being punched solidly in the gut. He certainly brings his message home on a freight train of an emotionally packed story line.I did not go to a 5 star because I thought the end was a littleunclear...I would have preferred a little less clutter there.I read this immediately after BLOOD MEMORY which I thought was the better of the two...but I enjoyed Turning Angel immensely and found it to be a many-faceted 'hard to put down' read.Don't miss either one...too good to pass up!!!
2,Dumb Angel,"You know the author is in trouble when he describes a character as still an inposing 6'2' despite the loss of a foot (leading one to ask ""what(?) should he now be 5'2'?"" This novel is full of holes and discrepancies. Alas not even a good airplane novel."
1,Get this guy a competent editor,"This book is about 100 pages too long. Terrible editing,plus way too much repetition and detail. Entire paragraphs could be removed. I am only half way thru and this is a long slog. A very disappointing read. His last 3 books have been bad! Save yourself both time and money - don't buy this book."
3,Turning Angel a Penn Cage Novel,"The story started out strong, but seem to drag though the middle with unnecessary and drawn out scenes. I feel this would have been a better read if it had been cut back, and at 646 pages, this could have been easily done."
5,Greg at his best,"it was wonderful to return to Cage's hometown and spend days in suspense. There have only been a couple books written by Greg Iles that didn't hold my interest. This certainly wasn't one of them. Like in most books there was a period about 2/3 of the way through that he could have moved on a little faster, but the story was interesting, sad, perhaps almost too true and brought so many aspects of life in a small southern town. The ending certainly did throw me, I wonder how many others will be surprised. I hope he does more books using a similar setting."
3,"Great Beginning, Not So Great Ending","Other than the fact that I figured out who the killer was before page 10, this book started out wonderfully. I loved the intensity and could not put it down. However the last 100 pages fell reluctantly short by far. I mean honestly, how many people can stumble across one dead body!? Very unrealistic. The whole younger woman older man scenario was stretching it a bit too. I understand a younger girl falling for an older man, but not EVERY girl in the town. It got a bit out of control at times, and turned a little sleazy at others. Overall I might recommend it, but I have definitely read better."
2,Turning Angels is my first Greg Iles read and it will be my last,"I had heard such great things about Greg Iles and had not read anything by him because murder mysteries are not my genre. Remember, I just owned up to the fact that murder mysteries are not my thing. So, a book has to be good; no, really good; to impress me. However, a friend was so excited about his books and told me that this was just a page turner so I was eager to give it a go.The book is a pot boiler. Truly all that is missing is the kitchen sink. The plot has no depth, teaches us nothing and hopes to convince us that the mere complexity of who could have done it makes it a brilliant book.The murder scene becomes laughable with so many who-done-its right there like they were all invited for a wienie roast.I finished the book and was interested enough to do that. However, I walked away from it wondering why I felt like I had to shake my head and find something to read that would take the bad taste away. This is not a good book."
1,Save Your Money,"I used to be a fan of Greg Iles but his writing has gone steadily downhill and his most recent novel is really the nadir. The plot is completely contrived and full of implausible developments whose only purpose is to keep the narrative careening along at breakneck speed so that you don't stop to ask whether it makes any sense (which it doesn't). The characters are equally unbelievable, from the overachieving male protagonists whose lack of common sense makes you wonder how they tie their shoes in the morning to the vapid, Ivy League-bound coeds whose sole fictional purpose seems to be to satisfy the wet dreams of Mr. Iles and his middle-aged readers. Underlying it all is a leering voyeurism that makes the self-congratulatory moralizing of the narrator seem completely fraudulent. If you want cheap thrills tarted up as ""unflinching realism,"" save your money and watch the OC."
4,Excellent Writer,"The Author Greg Iles did an excellent job writing the e-book. This e-book is written in the first person. This is a Penn Cage story it does not say that on the cover, you have to read the back cover to get that. The Author takes small pieces of information from different characters in the story and creates tension. Then while he is building the plot he starts to chip away at the characters and makes them break down or hold up. The story takes place in a small southern town in Mississippi. There are southern charactors that bring out the richness and history of a small southern community. Along with the good history, the bad and crimanal element of a small southern town is exposed throught the whole e-book. This is a very well written e-book, excellent! This is a good story with lots of twist and turns. I have and would recommend this book to a friend."
3,Strong writing but incredibly racist,"This is my second Greg Iles book and I enjoyed the writing in both immensely. However, as engaging as they were, both were so rife with racial epithets and offensive stereotypes directed at African Americans that they were sometimes difficult to get through. I understand that Iles is trying to convey the sentiment of whites in the South and that racist views are often an element of said sentiment. But the racism was so glaring and so gratuitous that I cant help but think that Iles was really conveying his own hate-filled beliefs. If this is how most Mississipians think, its a sad testimony."
2,Be your own Mark Foley,"Thoughful male protagonists? If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you. Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim."
3,No title,"While reading this book, I kept thinking that there was alot of unneccesary time spent on some scenes and that the book would have been better if others were completely left out. It wasn't until I noticed all of the typos that I realized I was reading the ""advanced reader's edition"". I'm sure the edited version was good. Mr. Isles writes in a way that is easy to read and you can visualize the story without a ton of description. I recommend the edited version. It's entertaining."
1,But I still like Geg Iles other books,"This wasn't my favorite Greg Iles book...Perhaps it was because I didn't care for the subject matter...I have reached an age where I just can't identify with teen agers. Mr. Iles is a very good writer and I will not hesitate to buy another of his books..but I will read the ""squib"" on it very carefully.marge@dodgecity.net"
1,Little girls,"I normally like Greg Iles, but this book was just a little too obsessed with horny high school girls and middle age men lusting after the horny high school girls. Maybe I'm a prude, but it just seemed a little seamy and distasteful to me."
2,Not a page turner,"I have been working my way back from Greg Iles most recent book ""The Devil's Punchbowl"" which was pretty engaging. This was not. The book was too long, the plot rambling, and the characters undeveloped foils to Penn Cage's ego. Less is more in many things, a rule that should have been applied to the overabundant description of explicit sexual exploits. Iles has strong beliefs about politics and social issues but has not yet figured out how to smoothly weave them into a story."
4,he is wonderful!,Iles is one of the few authors that I can rely on to write an unforgetable story. Looking foward to his next work!
5,"An extensive, authoritative coverage not to be missed","MILTON AVERY is the first book to offer an in-depth tribute to the range of the artist's influential work, and is a 'must' acquisition for any serious college-level art collection. It packs in all of Avery's most important paintings, including many new ones, in oversized color plates covering the early 1920s to the early 60s, and it offers text by Robert Hobbs who explores his art and life in depth. The result is an extensive, authoritative coverage not to be missed!"
4,Looks amazing. Too bad it didn't last.,"Had this belt buckle for 6-7 months. Went out to eat with a buddy and stood up out of the car and the buckle broke, nearly in half.I suppose if you use it lightly it won't be bad, but I actually used mine frequently."
5,This is my Third Copy,"I've been scuba diving for 20+ years and have thousands of dives....and yet every now and then I still find myself thinking, ""what was that little blue fish....?""I keep a copy of this guide in my dive bag for quick reference. It's often passed eagerly around among other divers who want to identify something after we surface. Better and more complete than a fish-card, but not as bulky as some other books. My only complaint is that the book sometimes does't get back into the dry-bag so I have to buy a new one...."
4,Great book.,Great book. Has most of what you will see in real life in and the pictures make IDing things easy. Very helpful!
5,Dog's Favorite!,"I had to buy these replacement birds because the original ones were getting pretty nasty after a few years. Little did I know that I could wash them, so now ill be washing instead of throwing away. My Beagle loves it when I put these birds inside the birdhouse and she can dig them out! Now that my son is a year old he loves it too!"
4,Fragments of Lives,"I believe in reading a book on its own terms-- its own internal logic. The crescendo built in this book as these fragments of lives come together in the draft riots of New York City. The power of the book lies in the premise that it is the stories of these individuals, otherwise lost in the mass of humanity, that form the real stuff of history -- not so much the generals and tycoons. Bedford, a minor player on Wall Steet, Dunne, Eliza, Margaret are all swept up in the events of the times. Mixing non-fictional character such as Noonan and Stephen Foster, minor characters even on the larger stage, I thought was particularly effective. I admire what Quinn did with the clippings from historical archives, included at the end of the book,in fashioning his imaginative world. Place--geography--shapes character, events more than we care to acknowledge. The power of place is all important here."
1,Misnamed,"After debunking the Y2K concern as a scam by ""Chicken Littles"" trying to sell stuff, Mr. Cook attempts to fill the pages of his latest book with generic ""investment"" data that we have all heard before. Subjects such as getting out of debt, paying off your mortgage in half the time, and how to form corporations and trusts have no place in a book entitled Y2K - other than to fill up pages. Furthermore,another 13 pages,(10% of the book) is dedicated to selling his other books and audiotapes. I am compelled to agree with him when he complains about people using the Y2K issue as a means to sell products!"
3,Amazon description,"""About the AuthorThomas's mother was a registered nurse. she was born in 1910 just before this book was originally published. He wanted to show the moral thoughts of the time in which his parents were coming of age. --This text refers to the Paperback edition.""Who is Thomas? Certainly not the author."
2,TOO MORAL,"This books talks about interesting biological topics about sex, but I don't like the moral aproach."
4,"A very well-written, informative book on the B-1.","I recently started working on the B-1B and wanted to learn more about the history of the plane. This book definitely goes into detail over why and how the bomber was developed. I would have liked to have seen more color photographs of the B-1B in the book, possibly even some of the nose art. Over-all, very good reading material."
1,Poor quality -- buyer beware!,"Buyer beware! The quality of this product is poor. It does not look at all like the picture. The material is some cheesy, thin white felt material, not thick sherpa as advertised and shown in the picture. I called Petsupplyfactory to tell them I wasn't happy with the product. I think they're used to complaints because the man I spoke to didn't want to listen to me explain the problem, he said he'd send an email explaining the return. Any questions I asked he said would be addressed in the email. I just received the email and it says I am responsible for all shipping charges (to and from). So not only am I disappointed, but now I have to pay the $9.95 it cost for them to ship it to me and whatever it costs for me to return it to them. Poor customer service. I will not purchase from them again."
5,Great book,This is such a great book and a really touching story. What a wonderful addition to the series. I will be shopping with you in the future. Thanks again!!!
3,It's OK,"It's Ok for someone who hasn't already read any of his other books. If you have, you won't learn much new."
2,Unecessary and not very good,"This book covers a time that was already written about in The Lost Boy. Despite my love for Dave's other books I think this was an attempt to milk out more money from his already established fans. This book does not give much more information about his life and only a few forgettable fun stories about his teenage years. Don't waste your time on this one, just read the first three."
3,Not his best work,"I have read A Child Called ""It"", The Lost Boy, A Man Named Dave and Help Yourself and I must say that this book was not Dave's best work. The writing did not keep me interested as his other books have. While reading this I felt like the passion just wasn't there."
5,the privelege of youth,this is the best of the series of his books he is finally able to somewhat be kid in this book the book is trying to help kids cope he finally gets friends paul and dave i highly reccomend reading this book along with his others they all get five stars in my book lol
2,The Privilege of Youth: A Teenage's Story,"This product was advertised as ""very good"". When it arrived, I didn't feel it should have been listed any better than ""good"". It appeared a bit smudged and had water looking marks on the front as well as the back. Some of the pages had folded corners, etc. It also arrived over a week later than I was told it would arrive. I was happy with the contents of the story."
4,A visit with old friends,"This is a trip back to the salad days of ""The Green Hand,"" a group of friends including Charles Beaumont, William F. Nolan, Ray Bradbury, Harlan Ellison, and others. Most of the stories are new (including mine). A bit of sci-fi, some fantasy, a mainstream story or two, all by old pros."
2,misleading title,"I got this book thinking it would contain stories involving black magic or other weird things, but only a few of the stories can really be described that way. The Bradbury is the best in the collection, the Matheson not bad either, even though they are not horror. The Ellison one is the worst, it seems endless, while the Russell one shows why it camoes from an unpublished novel. The others are nothing memorable. The introduction would lead the reader to believe the three reprints would be the stories actually filmed for ""Twilight Zone"", so the book misleads both by title and introduction."
5,Great All Around Resource,"One of the best all-around resources for starting and operating a small business. Goes from choosing a legal for of business to bookkeeping, to paying taxes, to marketing. Great for anyone wishing to start a new business or to maintain and streamline an existing one."
3,Pretty tight for Asian,"I'm Asian and my feet are shorter and wider I guess, I normally wear size six but from the review I read I took the advice and ordered half a size smaller, turned out they are pretty tight if I wear them with thick socks. They are ok to go with very thin socks."
4,Shoe like a glove,"This is most expensive pair of shoes I've ever bought...and the most comfortable- right out of the box. They are very well made. My foot is a little wide- but the it is true to size and VERY comfortable- LOVE them! The quality construction will probably last for many, many years to come and they are timeless...I GIVE IT A 4.5!"
3,"Great shoe, just not for me.","I think this shoe would be adorable on a woman with a small foot. As it was, in a ladies' size 11, it looked like I was wearing my husband's shoes around. They are very well-made: Frye makes amazing products and I have many pairs of Frye shoes (they're almost all I wear!) but this style was really not for me.If you have small feet, anything 9 or below, I'd bet they'd be adorable. If you have great big boat-feet like mine, it will look like you stole some dude's shoes."
4,the real deal,"Love the leather, the heel, and the design of the shoe. However, the toe box it HEE-uge (huge), so I'm reordering in a smaller size. I'm guessing from the make of the shoe, that the smaller shoe will still give because of the lovely leather."
3,skinhead wig,"Just a warning, this particular one is best for those with extremely small heads. Another hair cap may also be required underneath the cap to hide one's hair. Those with normal adult heads should take note that this will look like a scrap of transparent latex pulled tightly over your head."
1,Total crap,"This product is a total waste of money if you want to use it as a bald cap. I got it for a halloween costume and it is worthless. Waste of money, even if it was only a few bucks. Don't bother with this."
1,consumer review,"THE SHIPPING WAS QUICK, BUT AS SOMEONE ELSE EXPRESSED THE PRODUCT IS PAPER THIN AND IT HAS A POINTED TIP IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN MILK THE HEAD IT IS ON. SORRY, IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE THINNESS I WOULD HAVE SPENT THE EXTRA MONEY FOR A THICKER ONE, THEY SAY YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
1,bald cap review,Cap is paper thin and therefore able to see hair through it. Looks like a prophylactic on head with a resevoir tip over top of scalp. Would have spent the extra money for the more expensive cap.
1,Too Thin And Made Poorly,"We purchased this bald cap for my nine year old son to wear as ""Daddy Warbucks"" in the play ""Annie."" However, it was awful - really thin and poorly made. He has very short hair but you could still see his hair THROUGH the bald cap. Also, the package recommends cutting around the ears to make it fit correctly... When we did this it made the cap fit even worse! Also, the top of the cap comes to a little point making him look like a cone head. I do not recommend this product!"
1,Don't buy this,I bought a bane mask recently and I wanted to get a bald cap to go with it. This piece of crap would only fool someone that saw me at a far distance. Haha i would like to actually meet the person who's skin color actually matches this! But they don't exist so....
3,Weirdly transparent,"This bald wig has a strange transparent look, but it delivers a decent Bald look from a distance. It could probably be used once or twice before it starts to tear, but for the price, it is a fun Halloween addition."
1,Dont Buy!,Purchased this bald cap for the Dark Knight Rises opening night to attend the film as Bane so i didnt have to cut my hair. Researched them a little and heard they were thin so i bought two of them. They look nothing like them do in the picture...they are white not flesh colored. These caps are also incredibly small i ended up getting Spirit gum in my hair because the bald cap would move and snap back into my hair. I ended up having to cut all my hair off for that reason as well. If i could id return this product but i threw the caps out. Buyer Beware not a good product.
2,The tether isn't there,I couldn't hook my tether to it now after 25 years I hve to worry about forgetting my gas cap
3,ok,"This product just came into the shipping package, no box or anything, plus it didn't seem to be completely full. I'm not sure if that's how it's suppose to be since it's the first time I actually bought it."
3,excellent placebo effect,"Did you know this is just water!?, ok, granted, mineral water, but just the same thing you'll find in a regular bottle of evian. Even though, the effect seems to be more of a placebo than anything else. People who go for brand impact will find this to be a great product."
3,so so`,"just ok, it is not as useful as i expected. it doesn't worth this price, not so much diffirence with normal water."
5,Evian Mineral Water Spray,My husband uses this as an after shave and feels it prevents his face from being so dry. He is allergic to some of the ingredients in regular after shave and cannot use it.
5,This fine mist spray is versatile and effective,"I keep it on my vanity and use it to ready my skin for applying moisturizer - helps absorption, or before applying makeup - helps blending. The 5oz size is just right. Only wish Evian would also make these in decorator cannisters so it is less like displaying their brand name on my vanity table."
4,Great for sunbathing,"I use nothing to get in the way of the sun's rays except this water to cool me off. Love it, Easy to cary in small bottles, good for my skin. So NOT believe in all the scare tactics that would have you live in a cave. Keeps you cool."
5,AAHHHH!!!! THAT FEELS NICE.....,"I got this as a gift from a dear friend. He told me that all the women in France use it....so I wanted to be chic as well. I use it often, especially on a hazy, hot and humid day like I had today.Good for the beach, the pool, the gym....refreshing. A very nice spray comes out, an even misting. It is heavenly.I have permed hair. On hot days I spritz my hair if it looks frizzy. It helps with my hair conditioner, too.I bought another spray can on sale at Lord&Taylor;, it was a package: the larger size with 2 travel sprays for $16 bucks. Try it. Give yourself a spritz, and you too will say: AAHHH!!! THAT FEELS NICE!!!!"
5,Best solution for skin irritation for pets,Within a couple of days my dog felt better: the skin irritation got dry-peeling. No more endless itching. His skin is now clear of inflammation. I also give him Benadryl-one 12 hour pill. It helps.
1,A review in process,"After waiting TWO MONTHS for this fan, it finally arrived, in wrapping that has seen better times.The fan itself looks new. However, the assembly instructions were not in the box.I found instructions on the web, tried to follow them, only to realize that the screw that attaches the blades to the shaft is missing! In addition, there is a rubber sleeve on the shaft which I think is supposed to be removed, although the instructions do not mention this. Lastly, the instructions talk about ""clips"" that put the grille part together, while the fan I have has clips and one screw+bolt that must be attached to the grille.This being a weekend, I cannot contact Soleus. Tomorrow, I plan to request an instruction manual, the missing screw, and some explanations.I hope to update this review once I have an operational fan, whenever that might be."
2,cheap shots,I will grant you that the writing is good....therefore 2 stars. The story itself is a rambling mess. The ending is just pathetic.Incest???? Give me a break. I really took offense at the authors attempt to sneak her anti war and anti American rhetoric into the story line.She did not have any facts to back up her case and left just enough information to leave an impression. The story nevercame together except the ridulous ending of the siblings. I was really disappointed.
4,Ambition is not a bad thing,"Living life to the fullest is not just for non-Christians. A common misconception is that Christians should have no ambition as this would be prideful. If done merely for the self, this book indicates that it would be prideful, but if done to glorify God, then it is okay.Dr. Jeremiah, senior pastor at Shadow Mountain Community Church in California, gives us scripture to back up the premise that we should live our lives to the fullest. As with many of his books, his explanations are not just biblical exegesis, they are solid, common-sense explanations. He uses everyday examples to help the reader internalize the information.This book is a call to action, any action. This book is designed to help empower the reader to go after her dreams."
3,It was okay!,"It goes to much into detail. I did not like this book,if the author had taken off some detail, I would probably liked it more.But I still liked the story."
5,Good Book!!!!!!!!,This was a really good book! It keeps you hooked until the end. You can't wait to find out what happens next. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery. Caroline B. Cooney is an excellent writer and this book proves it.
3,Kept Me Reading All Night!,This truly was an incredible book! The charater takes you through every emotion she is feeling and makes you feel like your in the story as well. I have read every book Ms. Conney has written and this one is very good!
1,Wanted-Students Review,"We're students from M.S118. We chose this book because there were 5 different books to choose from and we chose WANTED. We thought it would be interesting. Then when we got into it, it got boring.Alice got a mysterious phone call from her father from a phone number she didnt recognize. He told her to meet him at thier favorite milkshake spot. She was WANTED for murder.4 out of 5 book club members thought the book deserved 1 star. One member says ""In The beginning, she keeps talking about her nails, she doesn't get to the point ."" One member thought it was suspenseful.I recommend this book for people who likes mysteries. It is appropriate for 12-15 years old people. It's not like any other books we have read."
3,decent Caroline B Cooney thriller,"Not at her very best but still very good, Caroline B Cooney has created a story about an innocent 15 year old named Alice, framed for her father's murder.Throughout the entire novel, we are stuck inside Alice's frantic and confused mind, as she becomes a fugitive and tries to discover the true murderer of her father, (a mystery that becomes very obvious a little more than halfway through the novel.)Again, fun mystery, but Caroline, please don't describe blisters again."
5,Morgan's 7th grade review,"Wanted!By: Caroline B. CooneyWanted! By Caroline B. Cooney was great! Right from the beginning it just sucks you in. The main character, Alice, is left with the decision of whether or not to obey her father. He calls asks her to find the two disks labeled TWIN and drive his corvette to their favorite ice cream parlor. She doesn't have a driver's license, but decides to do it because of some other strange things going on.At the ice cream parlor Alice hears-over the radio- that her father was murdered! Supposedly she confessed to doing this in an email to her mother. Now she can't trust anyone and is a fugitive (runaway from the police). Follow her on this unexpected experience. Just remember; don't assume someone is who they say they are..."
4,wanted kids book review,"The book Wanted! By Caroline B. Cooney is one of my favorites. Wanted! Is one of my favorites. Wanted! Is about a girl named Alice and, she is accused of her father's murder. Even her own mother believes that she killed her father.It all stared with a strange phone call from her dad. Alice's father asked her to drive his favorite car to this ice cream shack and bring a disk from his office desk. Alice is only 15 years old and doesn't even have her diver license. ""It doesn't matter!"" he yells her father.When she turned on the radio, there was announcement that her father was murdered. Someone confessed to his murder via E-mail, and the person was Alice!Everyone is after her including the murderer. She has no place to go. Alice needs to figure out who killed her father or else."
4,Wanted,"In Wanted by Caroline B. Cooney, there is this girl named Alice who gets a phone call from her dad. Her dad tells her to get the disk ""T.W.I.N."" from the desk and meet him at the ice-cream shack. This made Alice worried. Alice gets there, but no bodies there. Alice finds out that her dad is murdered. I think the book Wanted is a great book. I recommend this book to someone who likes mysteries."
5,Wanted,"Wanted is a great book. I'm not a big reader but this book was too hard to set down. The girl in this story gets a phone call from her father telling her to grab the TWINS disk and get out of the house. A strange man enters her house while she hides in the garage then she gets in her fathers car and leaves. She listens to the radio later and hears she is convicted of her fathers murder. So she turns to the one who helps her, her mom. But her mom was even against her. In this book she runs away and go through the rush of escaping when everyone knows. When she gets back to her dads she sneaks in and puts the disk in. Then she sees that her uncle was murdered by the same man but who? So this is the proof. She goes back to her moms to see what they think and all of her friends know something is wrong. Will she get caught? Who is the murderer? The end is a shock, someone you wont even think of."
4,Online Book Review,"Wanted By Caroline B. Cooney is a bout a girl named Alice Robie. One day Alice's Dad calls her, from an unknown number and says get the disks out of my bedroom and bring them to your favorite ice cream shop. Alice isn't old enough to drive. Her dad says ""it doesnt matter"", drive my corvette. This is all to weird for Alice since she has never been able to even touch his car before. Someone breaks into her house before she gets a chance to leave she hids underneither the ""vette"" until they leave, but before they leeave they say, ""i killed him good."" As soon as they leave, Alice gets in the car and drives to the ice cream shop her dad doesntcome. She turns on the radio and it says she has killed her father and has sent an e-mail to her mom confessing she killed him and saying she ran away.i really liked this book. It was really suspensful and mysterious. I would recomend this to all my friends."
5,It was one of the best Cooney books I've read!,"I read it once before, and I forgot I read it, so I read it Again, and it was awesome! It kept me glued to my couch! I thought it was a gripping novel that was well thought out!!!!!!"
4,Wanted a book by Caroline B Conney,"This is a tale about a girl and her father who has gotten into some trouble. He has something that someone else wants and now they are after the disk that will make them powerful. At first Janie is clueless to what is going on until one day the ""stalkers"" come to her house. She then figures out what they are after. She now is trying to hide from them to keep them from hurting her.In my opinion this is an excellent mystery-suspense novel. If you like mystery then this is the book for you. It is a ""can't put down until you're done"" book. It has all essential elements to be a wonderful thrilling book. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
4,A Great Mystery,"This book is about a teenage girl who is believed to have murdered her father. When a strange man comes into her house while he father is at work, she is scared to death. She runs and hides under her father's Corvette. While the man walks out of the house, he says ""I killed him good"". She later finds out that he killed her father. But who is he?I thought this book was great and i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery."
5,~Best Book Ever !!!~,This book is one of the best mystery books I've ever read !!It's packed with Action and Suspense. Wanted is a book for everyone who is looking for some mystery. If u read wanted u have to read Emergency Room and Driver's Ed. You just have to !!!
5,"Suspensful, incredible, a great book for all teens & adults","I recently read this book ""Wanted"" and I have to tell you it is one of the most wonderful mystery books of all times. I never really liked to read that much. But every once and a while a person finds a great book. and this is one of my top 5 books of all times and I highly recomend buying it. If you like mystery and suspense you will love ""Wanted""!"
2,It was ok ( I guess),"This book was kinda boring. There wasn't really any action. It was about a girl named Alice and 1 day she gets a call from her dad. He tells her 2 get some disks in his office and 2 meet him at a milkshake shop. She goes there but he never shows up. Then she hears on her radio that he dad has been murdered. After he was murdered, Alice's mom got an email from Alice confessing that she killed her dad. But Alice didn't send the email. Someone else did. And in the whole book, Alice is trying 2 find places 2 hid from the police. It was just really boring and a waste of time."
3,Wanted!!,"In Wanted, an adventurous story written by Caroline B. Cooney, there many things occur. It's a story about a teenage girl that is put in a dangerous situation by her own father, who was also in great danger. She's asked to do something very unusual that a parent wouldn't ask, but there's a really good reason for this. Although there are some inexplicable and rare events that leave you with many questions and confusions, it's a suspenseful story. I enjoyed reading the incredible things that happened to the poor teenage girl and how she overcame the things she went through in this story full of events. It's a non-stop action story from beginning to end that was fun to read. I liked the story, but in my opinion it could have been better organized and clearer."
5,ITZ THE BEST!!!,"WANTED! By Caroline B. Coooney is a REALLY good book, i haven't quiet finished it yet but i'm almost done i can't wait to find out who the killer is!!! this book is a really good book!!! I bought it at my scholl book fair (i'm 12) and i love it!! Itz really good so far. This book is the first bookof Caroline B. Cooney that've read. ANd itz great i'm looking forward to getting more of her books to read you should really buy this book itz GREAT!!! Even if other people hated it ( I don't see why they would) don't pay attention to their remarks pay attention to ours cuz this book is GREAT it is deffinately worth reading!!!!!! A great book to buy!"
4,Very Impressive,"I read this book for a book report, and normally all book reports are boring. extremely boring, but this was different. I found it hard to put the book down once I started it. Maybe thats just the way I am, but I enjoyed it."
1,Bored stiff,"I didn't like this book at all. I was hoping for a thriller like Flight 116 or Emergency Room, but I finished it in a hour and was bored through the whole thing. It was very presictable and I just wanted it to end."
3,So far...mostly describes actually air action,"Have only gotten 25% into the book so far though. LOTS of descriptions of aerial tactics and descriptions of sorties. It begins just about 9 days after D-Day.Not too impressed with the translation though. The book is laced with so many British colloqialisms you really wonder if the pilot is in the RAF or the Luftwaffe.First published in Germany in 1951, as ""Alarm in Westen"""
4,Kate O'Hare: the Anti-Lombroso,"As a dedicated Socialist and activist, Kate Richards O'Hare did much to improve the lives of her fellow prisoners, and her care for them is apparent in her writing. Though one does feel a slight detachment in her words, I believe that her difficulty in getting close enough to her fellow inmates to truly empathize with them is borne of her status as ""a lady"" behind bars and the inmates' knowledge of that status. O'Hare was one of the first women who had experience prison to write of life behind bars in a sociological manner and she does it brilliantly. Buy this book for research or for pleasure- you won't be sorry!"
2,Kinda Dull,"I like her music but I don't think I'd like her as a person. She seems to have a tendency blame everyone for her troubles but herself. For this to be a tell-all book, she just glossed over the fact that the members of her group sued her. She simply blamed that on Motown. Ms. Reeves claims to be a born-again Christian but it's hard to believe that when you read about her feelings toward the late Tammi Terrell. I had read in another book that the 'women' of Motown were jealous of Tammi but judging from this memoir, Martha seems to be the culprit. I'm glad I got this book off ebay for a low price."
4,Dancing in the Street,I wish the book had a better cover... It was a rather plainish looking type of book with some markings. But it was in good condition.
1,"Cheap, and there's a reason.","So i bought this (new) battery because my old one was wearing out, but even after fully charging this new one multiple times it still only has the battery life of a few hours. Which is less than my old battery."
2,"OK at first, then won't hold much of a charge","Like other reviewers, I have found that this battery starts off ok, but after a few months it will not hold much of a charge. I have to recharge it every 9 hours (standby time) and I can only talk for a few minutes on it before the phone shuts off. I like my A900 phone, so I will be buying an original OEM battery from Samsung, if I can find one."
2,waste of money,this battery is useless. It doesn't even last more than 30mins of talk time. The battery also will turn itself on and off. Don't buy this product.
2,Not a good battery,"I bought this battery to replace the original one in my Samsung SPH-A900 phone, and it turned out to be a dud. No matter how much time I charge it, I can't get more than a few hours of run time from it. If you need to buy a new battery, better pay a little more for an original Samsung, this one's not worth the money."
4,Awesome,Easy to install. Ride is much much better than the rough county springs I had on before. I was very disappointed that they were not red as in the picture.
4,The Rhyme Holds Up After All These Years,"This book was a childhood favorite, and my son has my well-worn copy. When I heard it was going to be reprinted, I immediately made a list of all the kids I know who need a copy of their own. I give this version 4 stars ONLY because of the new pictures. I am disappointed that the illustrations have been re-done by George Booth, but that is my only criticism of the re-print, and it's probably unfair. The original pictures are burned into my memory as the real deal. The kids to whom I've given this new version are delighted-- they never knew a different set of illustrations, and they find the rhymes as silly and fun as I did all those years ago."
3,"Beware of lid size, otherwise good value","The construction is very solid, however the lid size is extremely small. Will work well for average-sized people, however this is a bariatric commode made to accommodate up to 650 pounds. I am 370 pounds and male, and it's impossible to use for urination while sitting down. I had recent hip surgery and it has worked okay for the most part, but again, the lid size has made some situations very difficult. Beware if size is a consideration."
3,It works.... mostly,The guitar is functional. Sounds like a toy and the strings hit the frets during playing. It's not a serious instrument but it's good enough to teach a child to play on I think.
1,"Horrible ""instrument""","This is the worst guitar I've ever played. Let's start off with the string buzz. Absolutely horrendous string buzz on every string, This guitar inexplicably has an extra fret, most guitars do not have a fret right next to the nut, but this one does. What's even worse is that when you fret the first or second fret, the same note plays?!? I've been playing guitar for 20 years and trust me, this guitar is worse than most toy guitars. Stay far away!"
4,Great beginner guitar,"I purchased the 3/4 Dean Playmate Mini Acoustic Guitar for my 8 year old son who has shown an interest in taking guitar lessons. The guitar is the right size for him. The build and sound quality are pretty good considering how much the guitar costs. It's not cheap like a toy but it's not as nice as a Yamaha or Fender, which you pay more than double the price. You have to constantly tune the guitar when you first get it until the strings settle. After that, the guitar sounds pretty good. The Dean Playmate Mini Acoustic guitar should last my son until he outgrows it."
2,Not the product advertised,The guitar is listed as a 3/4 size. When we brought it to a local music store to have a string replaced. We were told that it is actually a 1/2 size. They showed us the same model guitar in a 3/4 size and it was definitely not a 3/4. We were very disappointed.
5,great buy,"I've played guitar for 14 years and bought this for backpacking, traveling, etc. This is a great student guitar and great value. Small, compact, has a decent sound after changing the strings and great price for actual quality."
1,not too great,"I've had popping and cracking along with the volume coming and going...etc...That is the speakers only 12 feet straight away from the feed.Don't buy these, go elsewhere."
2,Would be great if they worked.,The price was wonderful but after about an hour of trying on two different stereos I couldn't get them to work. I could pick up other radio stations in the area but not my stereo. I've heard that wireless speakers are a risky buy but I had hoped for the best. Maybe they'll work on someone else's machine but they sure didn't for me.
3,GREAT PRICE BUT NOT A GREAT PRODUCT,"THIS ITEM LOOKS GREAT AND HAD A GREAT PRICE BUT IT TOOK ME THRU A LOOP. ALOT OF STATIC, FUZZINESS AND CONSTANT MUTENESS."
1,Don't waste your time,"I only needed these to work over about 40 feet and through 1 wood cabinet door, less than 1 inch thick. NOT. Worst sound ever. When you can actually get sound (intermittently) it is like the worst AM radio you have ever heard. Wasted time, wasted shipping. Spare yourself."
3,What do you expect?,"We all know wireless speakers' reputation... But when you are to install some kind of ""surround"" sistem in a room with lots of doors and don't want to place ""miles"" of wire, this is your choice. They work just fine. Not the sound for a preciosist fan, nor perfect quality. It takes a while to align the sistem properly, but lesser than wiring your entire place. I suggest to place the antenna the higher you can. Batteries are the tricky thing: 8 AAs per speaker, quite a lot. You can plug them in if you get 12V adaptors but they'll result more expensive than the speakers! So, if you expect reasonable quality sound (meaning no WOW's! at all...)these speakers are a good choice instead of wiring down your entire place."
5,"""Ten Stars at Least for Dixon's Edge""","Do you have a dictionary with 10,000 words ""above"" stellar and masterpiece""? You will need one after reading O'Keefe's brilliant work in Dixon's Edge! A must read...order one now!"
2,sterotypical,"There's no doubt that Dennis O'Keefe did his research on Dixon's Edge. However, I couldn't get into this novel. The characters and situations were so sterotypical and predictable that it was difficult to read. I kept having to check the copyright and make sure that this wasn't written in the 1950s instead of the 21st century."
4,Scissor Tailed Flycatcher is a Hoot!,This bird is so adorable. My 7 year old son and I are into bird watching together. I got this for him for Christmas stocking as it is our State bird here in Oklahoma. Sounds just like our flying little friends do! Adorable! Serves it's purpose exactly as expected. I did have to add a couple stitches under one wing that had pulled a bit but it was no big deal.
4,Good Weight Good Replacement,i have a Pearl Demon Drive Eliminator Double Pedal Which is one of the smoothest and best Pedals I have played. I have had it a little over two and a half years now and it still gives out superior quality and play. Well I have had the same beaters on it since i bought it they are very good beaters but still not perfectly weighted or really even close to what I really like. Nonetheless I used them they were great but worn out and I needed to get some new ones. This beater looked promising and like it was pretty well weighted. Well my judgment was correct and it was good quality although it is not the exact weight that would prefer such as a mapex rock beater would be but they work great and i plan on keeping them until they wear out as well. Great buy not perfect but for the time being close enough.
5,great resource,this is an excellent book for artists and art lovers who have an interest in Symbolism.this is a great resource for students too.
2,But what exactly *is* Symbolism?,"""Symbolism"" is a coffee table book showing (mostly ugly) art from the latter half of the 19th century. However, the book never really answers the question: What exactly *is* Symbolism?After hundreds of pages of pseudo-erudition, I'm still not any wiser than before reading the book. There seems to be a total disconnect between the text and the paintings analyzed, nor do the works of art seem to have much in common with each other. And what on earth are the Pre-Raphaelites doing in this volume? Were they Symbolists? Nor do I understand the difference between Symbolism and Modernism, except that the artwork of the latter is even uglier.If you want a colourful volume of ugly, incomprehensible art, I'm sure you are going to like ""Symbolism"". Otherwise, you might as well skip this one."
3,It's okay....,"I'm all for weird books and stories, but Barry Yourgrau's A Man Jumps Out of an Airplane was a bit too much for me. I liked (and could keep focused) about 25% of the short stories in this collection of flash fiction. Some of it was just too crazy for me, and some were crazy but with some substance to them. I think it would be interested to take some of Yourgrau's more substantial short fiction and turn them into movies -- depending on who does it and how it's done, of course. Take everything literally, and you'll just have a Rene Magritte movie that doesn't really make sense.Hey! Excellent way to explain Yourgrau and probably a great compliment to him as a writer -- his writings can be greatly compared to Magritte's art. Enough sad. If it's your ""thing,"" then you'll love it. If you need a bit more to hold a story together, then you may be driven crazy."
2,Worth reading for a perspective of the event,"The book is not a mover in any sense, the author makes it painstakingly clear that he was not responsible for the IDF's mistakes. The reader is left with either pronouncing him an unrecognized hero or a coward who would not go through with his pasifistic inclinations. Which ever the case it still lives as aliving document of a person who refused to march to the drum beat that was offered at the time. for those who have been to Israel you are aware of the bravado that is placed on their soldiers and this man was in the autumn of life and had seen enough tradgedy from the second world war to fill a life time. Don't go into it expecting to much and you won't be disappointed."
4,Nice spectacle,"A great masterpiece this is not. Tchaikovsky composed better operas. Still, this production by the Royal Opera is worth for the theatrical spectacle. The stage, the colorful scenery and the Ukrainian folkloric designs are beautifully done. The ballet and the Cossacks are delightful. As for the music, with better singers it could have been somehow better. The biggest disappoint is Grivnov's Vakula. His voice is not big enough for this role and it gets lost. A stronger and fuller voice would have been much better. Still, the overall production is entertaining and nice. For an opera that won't be produced often, buying and watching this Blu-Ray disc is worth it. I enjoyed it and had a good time. Just don't expect to discover a masterpiece."
2,"""Boooring""","Someone told me this was a nice opera/ballet for children so I got it for my 6 y.o grandaughter who loves Coppelia, Swan Lake, The Nutcracker, The Magic Flute, Hansel and Gretel and the like. She hated it, and later I watched it also to see what it was all about and if possible, to elucidate the reason for her reaction. The dancing and singing are all right but the music is not Tchaikowsky's most inspired and the plot develps slowly, and is convoluted and quite boring. No wonder I had never heard of it before !"
5,This book is filled with powerful and useful information.,This book is filled with powerful and useful information. I would reccommnd this book to anyone that whats to be a better leader. I have read it from cover to cover and continue to use the book as a refernce and a source of ideas and motivation.
4,Reflections on Masterful Coaching,"Robert Hargrove's work, Masterful Coaching, is a thought-provoking journey into the essence of what is required for the transformation of individual contributions within organizations. As such, it provides both inspirational and pratical guidelines for the manager who wishes to impact the growth of his/her people. The ideas are rich and the challenge profound for those who wish to embark on such a journey."
1,Leaders as coaches,"Not a difficult book to read on the importance of coach's influence inside of organizations and their need for commitment and vision. Starting with a definition of what Hargrove terms a transformational coach and their responsibilities he uses quotes, examples, and case studies to demonstrate his ideas of an effective coach.At times the word coach could be translated to leader or leadership whether in a corporation, military, or other endeavor, however his predominate use of the word is that of mentor. He portrays this person as a master at working with others to create change, collaboration, action, and above all vision.His simple graphics and tables give a simple outline view of his major points making them very clear to the reader. The setup of this book makes it useful as an easy reference when the reader is looking for quick guidance and for later review. It is a book for anyone who plans to influence lives for change."
4,Insightful Coaching,"An insightful account of the true meaning of coaching that goes to the heart of building and reliving the human spirit into organizaions that is quite amiss in today's corporate world.By honing in on true spirit of community building , Hargrove has given the concept of stewardship its real place in today's material and self-interest based society."
4,We were outdoors a lot this past weekend ...,We were outdoors a lot this past weekend and my kids were bitten by mosquitoes. They were itching a lot so I was able to put this product to a good test. It worked great and stopped the itching on their mosquito bites. I tried it on my arm for a small heat rash and it worked great there too. I also like the Band-Aid name. I'm confident in using this product and will order it again.
2,"Mosquitoes love the taste of me, so I ...","Mosquitoes love the taste of me, so I was looking forward to trying something new to stop all the bites from itching. This really didn't do the trick though. It says it has extra strength itch relief and cool relief on contact. I kept waiting to feel some sort of cool, tingling sensation when I applied it, but there wasn't any. I don't think I experienced any """"fast relief"""" either, although the itching did lessen up some after a few minutes. It was nice to try, but I don't think I'd buy it again."
4,The product did what it said it would. ...,The product did what it said it would. The itching subsided. I would've given the product five stars had it smelled a bit more pleasant.
1,Deserves 0 Stars,It is amazing what gets into print. This is a Bad Book. It is full of insane rants and inaccurate statements. There are good books on PosgtreSQL. PLEASE go buy one of them and not this.I suspect the first two reviews are actually by Al Dev.
4,One delight among good material,"Shocking Blue created a substantial quantity of material, much of which is better than the famous ""Venus"". The gem on this album is the haunting ""Daemon Lover"". The pleasant ""Water Boy"" is notable for featuring a sitar. There are a variety of musical styles here (""Sally Was A Good Old Girl"" is country, for instance) and this adds to the impression that the musical quality is uneven. Several songs (including ""Little Cooling Planet"" and ""Seven Is A Number In Magic"") have unusual rhythms that dominate the other aspects of the music. Generally, like all of Shocking Blue's music, this CD has a peculiar charm stemming from many sources, one of which is that much European rock sounds akilter to American ears."
4,Simple device adds storage area,"These inexpensive racks work well. We have two of them under the kitchen sink to keep dish gloves, sponges, brushes, stainless wipes and other small items. Because these are high up on the door it is easier to find items than fishing for them out of the bottom between all the other larger containers. On complaint we have is that one of them came out of square meaning it had been deformed somehow. But my husband was able to coax it back into shape and it worked fine after."
3,Love It!,Just what I wanted. Keeps my husbands medicine all in one place. (He tends to spread everything) Easy install. Nice and deep to hold large bottles.
5,Great Organizational Rack!,"Functional, Sturdy, and great value for what it does. It holds wide bottes such as oil and vinegar bottles, ketchup bottles, etc... Love this!"
5,"Great product, had to return","Measure, measure, measure! I didn't and had to send this little guy back, but a very simple, practical piece. I just measured the whole door, not where the screws would go. Big mistake. Measure what you want the basket to cover, then take a 1/4"" off of each side, as thats where the screws will sit, and you don't want to screw through your cabinet MDF."
4,"Good rack, simple, exactly as represented","I'm living in a 750sf apartment and am having to be somewhat innovative regarding storage. I purchased this rack to place on the back of the door of my over-fridge cabinet. I use it to store a few bottles of wine, sherry, etc. It does this very well, and because it swings out toward me on the back of the door, I don't have to get my step stool to reach them. It holds 3 bottles very nicely and makes an awkward storage space much more useful. I used Closetmaid 754600 Down/Solid Wall Clips, one on each side at the top to add security to support the weight of the full bottles. I'm not sure this was necessary, but believe in ""better safe than sorry""."
4,Small rack perfect for cleaning supplies and laundry items,I bought separate screws with anchors to install in a laundry closet to hold smaller cleaning items and spot treatment sticks and sprays. Very secure with the mounting method I used. There was a slight flaw with the orientation of the vertical part where the curved part for mounting with a screw is but since I used screws with a large enough head it wasn't a problem. Just make sure you drill the holes slightly closer together than you think you need so it doesn't slip off the screw heads.
4,Nice organizer,"If you buy this product you should consider making your pilot screw holes a hair closerthan what the wire holes present, as the wire tends to flex inward. The manufacturer shouldmake this screw gap a solid circle to prevent the wire from flexing. Overall though, a goodproduct and good for organizing your kitchen. Hope that makes sense."
4,I love Richard Bennett's Music - reminds me of the cinema.,Wonderful playing by Alexa Still - my daughter loves dancing to Summer Music. I am studying this piece for my Certificate in Performance and enjoy this style of music - easy to listen to.
2,Uniquely creative,Alexa Still's discography of rare and beautiful flute literature displays her unique gifts of wonderful and imaginatively varied tone production and inspired interpretation. I don't know another flute player who communicates as directly with the listener as does Alexa. She is the perfect advocate for Richard Rodney Bennett's whimsical and sometimes wistful music. Summer Music is a delightful romp; Memento is intense and moving. All prejuidice aside - I produced the recording - this is a lovely record and I would encourage you to explore the rest of Alexa's discography as well.
5,The First Dilbert Book,"This is the first Dilbert book, filled with intelligent, totally funny humor on everyday life. This book did not have the official pointy haired boss, Wally, Alice, Ratbert, or Catbert. This book focuses more on Dilbert and Dogbert at home, on walks, and other places that don't have much to do with office life. These kinds of jokes are just as funny as the business jokes. This book should be read by all Dilbert fans."
4,DILBERT'S FORMATIVE YEARS,"This being the earliest collection of dilbert strips we can see where Scott Adams was still looking to find that comfort zone. Kind of like Seinfeld in its first two seasons. Many of the strips take place at home as opposed to the office and include many of Scotts Animal characters.Still you can see where the strip is going and certainly where it would be in a just a couple of years. The wry, sarcasm that we now know so well is rearing its humorous head."
5,Laughed out loud on every page!,"Comedic genius, at the start of Adams's world of Dilbert. I was laughing out loud on every page, to the mild amusement of my wife and kids. Scott Adams is brilliant, Dilbert is hilarious, and Dogbert rules the world."
3,From humble beginnings...,"It's hard to recommend this book, as regular fans of Scott Adams might not connect with his early work. There's very little office humor here, many strips are written around bad puns, and the drawings are crude (even for Adams). Still, there are a few chuckles to be had, and it's worth a look for those curious about how that ubiquitous cartoon nerd and his dog got their start."
4,A classic!,"This is the first Dilbert book! You can really see the transition over time of his graphics. Dilbert's head is super tall, but newer versions are not quite as tall. It's very very entertaining and you can see typical workplace issues being dealt with. Dogbert has a huge presence in this book and his early deviousness is coming out. Ok, its already out. I highly recommend this book for Dilbert fans who have not already added it to their bookshelves. A great one for the office bookshelf! Sometimes you just need a good laugh to make it through the day"
2,Pathetic commentary.,"I bought the 1st two DVD's of the series & find that the voiceover commentary is appallingly bad.The voice does not match the subtitles, there is no analysis only a shrill, breathless, non stop hectoring accompaniment to the video. A large part of the 1st in the series is a straight copy of Triumph of the Will but without the benefit of the soundtrack. Instead this voiceover barks out sentences from Hitler's speeches without any voice modulation. This makes a nonsense of the speech & completely obliterates the context & mood.I found that it is watchable only by turning off the sound completely & watching it mute. There are a lot of newsclips I have not seen before so it is not completely useless. At $12 a pop it is just about worth the money but could have been an awful lot better."
2,You get what you pay for,"I was very disappointed with this video. The voiceover was subpar and made the dvd almost unbearable. On the other hand, the video did appear to be factual."
2,It's not worth buying this one by itself,"This is easily the worst of the 20 episodes in this series; to begin with, it doesn't contain any newsreel footage as the name implies, and by ""early years"" it goes back to 1914. The first sections of this episode consist of footage of World War I with some sound dubbed in and a very boring and superficial commentary by the narrator of this series. We then get large chunks of a post-WW II documentary on the Nazis to explain the chaos of Weimar Germany and what led to Hitler's seizure of power. We then progress to edited sections of ""Triumph of the Will,"" and that's basically it. Even the edits from the latter film were chosen badly, as they could've selected some of those that showed the brutal force that lay at the heart of Nazism but didn't (the marchpast of the SS in Nuremberg at the end of the film, for example). I would only buy this episode if you were buying the set of the first five episodes, otherwise, it's not worth the money."
3,Risk Free Investing,"Like ""Land of Look Behind"" which this release superficially resembles, these collaborations take as their structural and cultural guide ""My Life in the Bush of Ghosts"" by David Byrne and Brian Eno. To wit, get some musicians into the studio (singly or in pairs), have them lay down some rhythm beds, and then mess around with the tapes until something interesting emerges.Leimer adds electronic looping and treatments, synthesizer drones, and self-consciously Byrneish voice samples to complete the rhythms. Many of the backgrounds and foregrounds go on a bit too long without change for my tastes, but fans of the original 1978 ""Bush of Ghosts"" (recently re-issued with bonus tracks) will enjoy Savant as an adjunct ""bonus album."""
3,"Reggie, a baseball star","George Sullivan's biography of Reggie Jackson is an accurate portrayal of his baseball career. It also includes Reggie's high school days and stats from his athletic career. The pictures included in the book, seem to be the most significant ones outlining key points in his baseball career. One can just look at the pictures and see the successes and failures of Reggie Jackson's playing days. I would definitely use this book if I were doing a theme on baseball. Reggie Jackson is truly one of the all-time greats."
3,good show,This is a solid time passer. Not great but good. I enjoyed watching all three seasons. I would recommend this to anyone into british comedy.
5,The Boosh is loose,"Great DVD item for any fan. It is definitely worth the price because it is PACKED with Boosh extras, including outtakes, their publicity (interviews and such), photo gallery, and much much more! The same can be said for seasons 2 and 3. I am more than happy with my purchase."
5,I love this show!,"I just started watching the Mighty Boosh on Adult Swim and I am so addicted to this show! I watch it over and over again on demand, unfortunately they only have two episodes on there right now. I am going to order the season one dvds from Amazon so I can watch from the beginning. There's something about this show.. I think it's the characters. It's strange... but in a good way! I am not usually one for british comedies, usually I don't get it, but this I get! I love those guys and hope Adult Swim will keep them on for a long time!"
3,Not as good as... [actual rating - between 2 and 3 stars],"I'd have to rate this weird stuff notches below ""Flight of the Conchords,"" ""Monty Python,"" or the original (BBC) version of ""The Office,"" to name a few favorite English TV series that were not exactly ""genteel."" I hope that chronic use of in-jokes, constantly going over the top, and grabbing a kangaroo's balls aren't the best that's available in current comedy."
5,Mighty Boosh Seasons 1-3 7 disc set coming!!,"Catalog#D56382. Amazon has the best Pre-Order price at $55.99. Official release date of this special collection is Oct. 13 2009. I'm holding out for this one.Meanwhile there's Adult Swim and Cartoon Network showing regular Boosh episodes and yes, of course You Tube for a Boosh fix whenever necessary.AND that's not all......the Boosh are coming to the US! They will be making an appearnace at Comic Con in San Diego July 24th, after first touching down in NY with a scheduled appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon July 22nd!!!! They'll be back to US. I'm hoping for an album, a movie on the big screen and a live US tour!!!!!Boosh Fans are 'alright!~Windy Blast Fast"
5,Comedy at its best!!,"The Mighty Boosh is perhaps the strangest, wackiest, and funniest TV series ever created. The first episode I saw was ""The Legend of Old Gregg"", which is THE funniest thing I've ever seen (it's on season 2 of the series). So when I saw the first season DVD in the store the other day, I decided to buy it and see if it was as good as Old Gregg.It was.If you like wacky, out-of-nowhere comedy, you'll LOVE The Boosh! My favorite episodes from season 1 were ""Killeroo"", ""Bollo"", and ""Charlie"""
2,Good and Bad,They said it was lost in transit after 2 weeks of waiting. They were very good with customer service though which was a nice way to get my money back.
1,Do Not Buy This - Doesn't Work,"I bought this cake leveler because of the good reviews and low price, but the first time I went to use it I found out why it's priced so low - IT DOESN'T WORK. Using a sawing motion as per instructions I couldn't get the thing to cut into my cake and wound up using a knife to make the first cut. Once the wire was past the crust, it cut well enough until it got to the other side at which point it started to tear the cake up rather than slice through it. Safe yourself a few bucks and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! There's a reason most cake levelers are in the $50 range and I must have been crazy to think one priced so low would do the job. :("
3,Celebration of Discipline,This book is a big help in discipline training for oneself. It helps you identify and grow .
2,Homophobic!,"Let me quote from the book (emphasis mine):""We can pray for sexual deviations with genuine assurancethat a real and lasting change can occur. Sex is like a river- it is a good and wonderful blessing when kept within itsproper channel. A river that overflows its banks is adangerous thing, and so are perverted sexual drives.What are the God-created banks for sex? One man and one womanin marriage for life. When praying for persons with sexualproblems, it is a joy to picture a river that has overflowedits banks and invite the Lord to bring it back into itsNATURAL channel.""How disappointing - I had so looked forward to readingthis book, but after this paragraph, I just couldn't takethe author serious anymore. Good thing I hadn't wastedmuch time, the quote occurs fairly early in the book..."
4,Gather some friends,"Our lives are too rushed and we often push out our time with God. And even if we have been taught from our youth of God's acceptance through grace, we tend to heap guilt on ourselves for missing our daily devotions. Practicing the presense of God becomes a burden.""Celebration of Discipline"" causes many changes of heart and motivation. Countless times I found myself saying ""I knew this but I never thought of it this way before."" Foster's treatment of each topic broke the burden of having to spend time practicing different spiritual habits. He inspired me to want to practice these disciplines in order to place myself in God's presence.This book can be read alone, but you will find it much more alive and practical (and far easier to implement) if you read it with a group of friends who are seeking a deeper relationship with the Lord."
5,always loved it - now I have a permanent copy,"I have always loved this book. It was a turning point in my spirituality and is good to return to. I bought the kindle version since I am allergic to old books, anything dusty, midlewy, or anything that has been around old books. So now I have a permanent copy that I can highlight and reread my notes. To me, this is a classic that inspired many other books on the practical side of fasting, prayer, solitude, giving, etc."
4,Spiritual Growth,"I've been listening to these off/on for the last few months, and really enjoy the message. Would recommend to the daily commuter."
5,Will advance your relationship with God,"I was slightly hesitant to read this book and took a long time to get around to it, mostly because I thought it would be difficult to follow or feel deadening. That was a silly worry. This is a lively, energizing, exciting book. It's the kind of book that you only want to read a piece at a time, because there's so much so start doing with each chapter. And while I recommend reading through the whole book, I think that slowing down a little as you match concrete action with each chapter is really beneficial. In my first reading of the book I was especially blessed by the meditation, fasting, confession, and guidance chapters. But that's just the first reading - before I was even finished I knew that I wanted to start reading it again from the beginning and take it even slower. Of the thirteen disciplines listed I wouldn't have changed a single one. If you take this book seriously, you will be blessed by it."
5,Celebration of Discipline,"This book is excellent. Foster opened up many doors to me that I had never seen before. I never knew that there were Spiritual Disciplines that would help me with my walk with Christ! But, now I know, and I am willing to take on the multiple challenges this book opened my eyes to."
4,Grow Spiritually,"Why is it that even the best nonfiction books always have terrible titles? ""Celebration of Discipline?"" Who decided to call this wonderful book by such a banal name?Foster explores the various approaches to Christian spiritual growth (Okay, face it, that little sentence makes this book sound as awful as the title....Why is so difficult to put words to experiences so close to our heart?) Let me just stop talking about the book and suggest that if you are interested in growing spiritually, you give this book a look-see. I found it very thoughtful yet practical."
1,All been said before.,"If the book follows the exerpts then the author is just restating things I've heard many times before. A new Christian may find it insightful but I though it boring. A new story, a different person but these books all appear the same to me."
5,Excellent book!,"We are reading this as a small group study, and it's excellent! Well written, informative, and thought-provoking; it's a pleasure to read and discuss."
4,Foster is great.,This book is a great read and these are great disciplines. I'd recommend this text to any Christian looking to broaden their faith by mind body life experience and discipline.
3,"Pleasure to read, but without biblical foundation","This is a well written book, easy to read and engaging.The problem is that the author often uses his own thoughts, few from the bible. And the few he uses are without context.I struggled specially with the chapter about meditation, because I can't find biblical foundation to many ideas presented.You can (and should) read Dave Hunt's Occult Invasion where he criticises (with biblical foundation) Foster's thinking."
5,True Spirituality,"This is what true worship is all about. Just when it seems that the Eastern Philosophies and other New Age religions have ""fruit"" here comes a book that will show you the disciplines that are the core to every believers life! This book breaks it down and gives you a wake up call to put to practice what you preach or step off the pulpit!"
3,Simplicity Best,"Of all the ""spiritual disciplines"" described in Foster's book, I have always liked 'simplicity' best. I read this book about a decade ago and still remember parts of it fondly. I think it is a bit too one-dimensional to say it is ""The"" path. It is certainly ""a"" path that promotes character development, personal integrity, appreciation for the daily miracle that being alive is, and wonder about the source of conscience, imagination, and hope. I have studied thought processes from Atheism to Zen by way of a Mormon upbringing and a deep dive into Christianity. This is a good book to read. It is not my all-time favorite, but it is helpful to learn to enjoy simplicity, solitude and contemplation."
4,There are good insights in this book.,The book is the subject of our Sunday School class. I needed it to participate in the study.
5,helpful for spiritual growth,This is a very good book for anyone who wants to deepen their spiritual life. I am studying it in a small group and am very pleased with the book.
3,Not Liked By All,"I read Foster's Celebration of Discipline several years ago. It is divided into three major movements of the Spirit which are further divided into 12 disciplines. Part one focuses on the inward disciplines (example - fasting). Part two is about the outward disciplines (example - service). The last part covers the corporate disciplines (example - confession). Although this book is praised by many as the most important contemporary book on Christian Spirituality (Christianity Today named it one of the top ten religious books of the twentieth century) and has sold more than a million copies, Foster's teachings certainly has critics with well-founded concerns. You will receive practical suggestions for everyday living in this book, but I suggest reading a historic, traditional, orthodox Christian viewpoint of Foster's book at the Apprising Ministries website."
5,wonderful resource,I enjoy sewing and crafting for my daughters. This book offers fun and exciting patterns which will make wonderful additions to their dolls' wardrobes. The book also came quickly and in good shape.
3,Patterns Missing,Book was in very good condition and it contained lots of interesting ideas but unfortunately all the patterns were missing.
3,LizziesMom,"Initially I was very happy to use this product. However, as my baby started to grow(aprox 3 weeks of age) she begin to move her way down to the bottom of the snuggle nest. I would wake in the middle of the night to find her little face in the bolster! I found this item to be a real risk."
3,Needs some improvements,"I got this item because our 3 week old loves to sleep with us and since i'm breastfeeding i thought it would be convenient but after getting it i wasn't completely happy with it. First of all, if you have a Queen size bed, there won't be much room left for two adults on the sides, second, if you breastfeed, you still have to take the baby out of it or slide him out of it so you can do it. I would recommend the maker of this item to create one on which the walls would come down to make breastfeeding time more convenient. I love my child with all my heart but i also enjoy sleeping with my husband next to me so i did not completely approved of this item. We also have the original co-sleeper that attaches to our bed and that is where our baby will safely spend his nights next to us."
1,Not impressed,All I have to say is this is the worst item that I bought my 12 week old wouldn't sleep in it and it was very hard and took up alot of space in our bed I wouldn't suggest buying it.
3,I think it's great what they're trying to do...,"but this product was not for me. I thought about letting my baby co-sleep, but I was a bit hesitant. I got this for my shower and decided to try it out. I agree with the other people, he got stuck and couldn't breathe. I believe that the real problem here, is that if I'd stayed with it, he probably would have had a really hard time adjusting to a new crib or bed later. I ended up putting him in his own crib after 2 weeks, and he sleeps in there just fine. I'm glad I avoided that train wreck! So, it the product is for you, good. But I would think about it, and read these reviews carefully. I sure don't want my baby to not be able to breathe in a product that should keep him safe!"
2,good in theory but not in practice,"At first, I thought this thing was great. I used it when my daughter was born when we traveled to my mother's house where there was no bassinet and also in her crib for daytime naps. However, when she was three weeks old and beginning to wiggle around I woke up one night because I heard her fussing. When I checked on her she had managed to wiggle her way out of the snuggle nest and in between it and the side of the crib. Needless to say the snuggle nest stayed at my mom's house when we came home that weekend, and we never touched it again. So I thinkit was a waste of money and a danger to my baby."
5,Everyone sleeps at ease!! Love it!,My husband and I wanted so much to have our new son sleep in our bed; only our bed is really soft. We were afraid that we might cause him to roll over in bed. We came upon the Snuggle Nest and tried it out. We love it
1,Sleep positioners dangerous/Not good for wigglers,"This seemed like a great idea for co-sleeping in theory. However, in practice it didn't turn out to be so useful. First, the sleep positioners seem dangerous. We were careful to position her with her arms above the sleep positioners thinking that would prevent her from her body sliding down. We woke one morning to find that our 3 week old daughter had wiggled her body downward and turned her head so that her face directly up against the positioner. We were worried that she could have suffocated. After that incident I did research at the national SIDS website. The SIDS website strongly discourages the use of sleep positioners. Secondly, our daughter was such a wiggle-worm. She frequently wiggled out the bottom which made the snuggle nest useless. Thirdly, it did not make breastfeeding in bed any easier."
1,Did not like it,"Although the concept for the snuggle nest is a great idea, I felt like the product could use much improvement. I tried it out with my two week old and didn't feel comfortable using it with her now, let alone as she got bigger and more mobile. The sides didn't come down far enough...when she started to wake up and fuss I felt like her little legs were starting to come off the mattress. And it wasn't easy to get her out of the bed in the middle of the night. I had to almost kneel on my bed to comfortably pick her up. The bed also takes up a lot of room in your bed, I have a king size bed and couldn't imagine placing this thing in anything smaller. I did not feel like this product was worth the $50 to last such a short time, for that kind of money I expect something with a little more quality to it."
5,Life Saver,"I bought this on a whim and thought before my daughter was born that we would use it as a changing pad. I even had it set up that way. After a couple days of her refusing to sleep in her cradle I decided to put the Snuggle Nest in her pack-n-play next to my bed. She slept the whole night through and has every night since! I had to remove the sleep positioner as it didn't allow her enough room when swaddled, but we now tuck the ends of her blanket between the baby and the plastic walls. She will sleep for 10 - 12 hours at a time in the Snuggle Nest in her crib. We have a California King and there was definately not enough room for this and two adults in the bed. Other than that we love it."
5,Life saver!,"This was one of the best purchases we've made. Our baby loves sleeping in it, and it helps me sleep better knowing he's protected in his Snuggle Nest. Midnight nursings are much more convenient now. It also folds into a compact shape for easy traveling. However, if you have a smaller bed, it is a tight fit."
5,awsome co-sleeper,I am so glad that I purchased this co-sleeper. My daughter is three weeks old now and she's been sleeping in her snuggle nest since the very first night at home. I don't have to worry I'll roll over my baby and it's so convinient to have her right next to me. It makes night feedings and diaper changes much easier. This is a great buy.
4,Free DVD that came with Snuggle Nest Made it Worthwhile,"We wanted to co-sleep with our baby but were unsure if we would cause her harm so we put this item on our registry. Having received and used it, we found that it worked well for us since it made us feel confident to co-sleep. We like the clip-on light that comes with it since it makes it easy to do quick checks on our baby without waking her. However, we didn't use the Snuggle Nest for very long since we had to move our baby out of our room so that my husband and I could take turns to use our bedroom to get some sleep. If you are planning to buy a co-sleeper, you can probably do just as well with a less expensive one. However, the DVD ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"" by Dr. Harvey Karp that came as a free gift with this item was excellent. All new parents should watch this DVD!!! Dr. Karp's tips was probably more valuable to us than the co-sleeper."
2,Waste of Money,"My son was having a hard time sleeping when we brought him home from the hospital. We call the nursery @ the hospital & asked them why? They told us to have him sleep w/ us. We did & it worked. He got some sleep but I didn't. I felt it was too dangerous. So my husband foud this Snuggle Nest & bought it. It took up so much space in the bed, it was also very hard & very dangerous! Suffication waiting to happen. My son hated it. He would rather sleep alone than sleep in this thing. We returned it. It is also VERY HOT. Everytime he slept in it he woke up soaked in sweat. Save your money. Put your baby in the crib or bassinet those are the only safe places for him/her."
2,WAIST!,This is a waist. Basinette is much better and it is a bad habbit to get into to begin with. for the same price you can get a no frills basinette. Unless you have a bed that is very very hard it will lean to one side and baby feels like he is on a sinking ship. I had to use towels to balance it and even then I had to wrap blankets around the measly little pad so that it would be comfortable enough and not hurt his head. You try sleeping on hard plastic for several hours with an unformed skull and only a thin pad to protect you.
2,Not practical for co-sleeping,"I read great reviews about the Snuggle Nest and had high hopes. I was, however, disappointed. It takes up a great deal of room in the bed-- my husband and I have a king-sized bed and we are average sized, but we barely had room to turn over!Additionally, the main reason I wanted to co-sleep was to make nighttime nursing easier. With the Snuggle Nest's ""walls,"" I still had to sit up and lift my daughter out to feed her . . . defeating half the purpose! Eventually I ditched the Nest altogether and my daughter slept in the crook of my arm. We slept much better, and my husband and I had room to wiggle!It is a good product to use for naps and such when the baby has the bed to herself, but it can only be used until she can roll over anyway . . . for me, a product that only works part of the time for only a few months isn't worth the $50 price tag."
4,Works great and keeps baby cozy,"We bought a Snuggle Nest right after the birth of our son. I had complications and was on bedrest for weeks, so this was a lifesaver - it allowed me to keep him close and nurse him without having to get out of bed at night. I didn't have to worry about him because the snuggle nest is very solid and kept him in place. The light is cool too because it's dim enough that it won't rouse him out of sleep.We transitioned him to his own crib after a few weeks (he's such a noisy sleeper and was preventing us from sleeping) by just placing the Snuggle Nest in his crib. He's now 7 weeks old and still using it - the side supports keep him feeling secure.I will be traveling with him soon to visit family and I will definately be taking it with me...its not too big or bulky and will fill nicely in the bottom of a large suitcase. I highly recommend this!"
4,Used it for both my kids,"I really liked this product because it made you (the parent) feel comfortable having a baby in your bed, on the floor, on the the couch or anywhere. It was a good size and I used it with both my children. It is only good for the first few months- most babies will quickly grow out of it. The mattress could be made better but I still thought it was a good item to have and made traveling easier. My husband loved the snuggle nest because of the safety aspect and how easily it stores."
3,Snuggle Nest,"This is a devine idea however the buyer needs to be aware the Snuggle Nest does require alot of ""safe"" space. Make sure your bed is at least a Queen size bed so the parents will at least have some room to snooze too. My daughter and son-in-law did not use this very long either. So you may want to consider a side crib or bassinet setting closer to your bed in a price vs practicallity basis."
3,Easy for baby to escape,"I like the idea of the Snuggle Nest, but we only got about a week's use out of it. At two weeks old, our son was already wiggling his way down and out of the nest. One night we woke up to find his head between the positioning cushions and his body half on our bed. We had to discontinue using it when we found he had wiggled his way off the nest completely, and was down by our legs!"
4,ON FIRE!,"While the recording, by today's digital standards leaves something to be desired, turn this up as loud as you can stand it, and you might just get goosebumps and feel the hairs standing up on your neck. Whatever the Velvets were up to when they created ""White light/White heat"", JB & Co. were doing here too. This is a perfect example of the performer(s) whipping the audience into a total frenzy, and the audience reflecting that frenzy right back onto the stage. It's that mystical, fleeting and elusive moment both audience and performer(s) seek again and again. If you have no other James Brown records, get this one."
3,Would be stars if the mastering wasn't awful.,"I Love J.B. and this is at his peak, no doubt. I've held out for a long time on this but no more. The mastering job on this is shameful. Compressed beyond all belief and given the historical aspect, it's disgraceful how this was handled. Great performance, yes. It's just too bad the sound is beyond awful and louder than hell. It'll probably never be re-released so this is what there is. I love the music but the sound is horrible."
3,"Kitten sized, but too small for a cat","I agree, it is just right for a kitten, but for a full sized cat it is just too small. Mine like to scratch with their back claws, too, and it isn't big enough. And they just aren't smart enough to turn around to scratch.Some cats prefer to scratch horizontally, so the flat design gives them an alternative to scratching the carpet. I have a couple who prefer the ones made at a 45 degree angle, though. Some won't use this at all, and prefer to sharpen their claws upright, so they'll need a different scratcher.But for someone just starting off with a small kitten, it's perfect. By the time the kitten is too big to use it, it will be time to replace it anyway. I had to throw mine out before it was all scratched up, though. Because when we adopted a new kitten, one of the disgruntled elders took a mighty crap right on it, to demonstrate his disgust with the addition of the newcomer."
2,Good for a kitten,"Would be a great product if it was a couple of inches larger in both dimensions. It's not big enough for an adult cat to stand on while scratching, which is essential for them to not have it kick-out while using it vigorously. I have a larger one from another manufacturer which my cats love, so it's a great concept. This one is just too small."
2,"Small, fragile, messy","I bought several of these for our four indoor cats. They're considerably shorter than usual, so medium- to large-sized cats aren't able to fit their whole bodies onto them. This means that the scratchers move around the room as the cats use them, trailing scraps of cardboard. The boxes are only single-thickness cardboard, so the sides break easily, resulting in more spillage. They're probably fine for kittens and small cats (5-7 lbs), but I wouldn't buy them again."
3,"Cost more than the Wide, which is no longer available on Amazon.","My cat loves these scratch boxes. I failed to read the description. When the box arrived, it was more narrow than the one we have ordered so often in the past. I was even more disappointed when I realized that this smaller amount of cardboard cost more than the wide box. Oh well. He will shred this one just the same. Three stars for ""It's ok."""
2,Tiny little scratch box for kittens - too small for our adult cats,We ordered some of these without reading the dimensions. They are much smaller than the ones we buy in pet stores. They might be useful for kittens.
2,Cat didn't take to it.,Cat doesn't really seem to dig this scratcher even though she enjoys shredding cardboard normally.
5,Nice set of speakers!,"I bought a pair of these to go with my DVD player and I have never been disappointed. I use a realtively cheap AIWA receiver, and I get fantastic sound quality from movies and music. Heck, even watching broadcast TV and my hi-fi VCR produce stunning sound. I've never heard any distortion coming from the speakers, and I've played some funky CD's with extremely low and high frequencies. However, I live in a 1 bedroom apartment and I do not play it at very high levels for long periods of time. They can get extremely loud and the bass is VERY deep, no need for a subwoofer that I can see. 5 stars for the speakers, 3 stars for the amazon.com price. Still a good deal for this kind of sound quality!"
4,What more could you ask for?,"These speakers have clear, powerful signal and great dynamics. The bass output alone allows for me not to use my subwoofer. The high dynamic outoput makes for clear-as-a-bell high. The dual 8"" 2-way mid-ranges are more than adequate for a rich, crystal sound. As a musician, I have taken great pains at obtaining adequate loudspeakers for my home system. This pair are worthy of a great listen.Careful about set-up, however. You can damage the speakers if you're not savvy on impedance/wattage capacity and the capacity of your amplifier to handle the speakers. Seek assistance before doing so if you're not sure."
1,"Warranty Excellent on Paper, Worthless in Practice","Just hope dosnt break, JBL has what looks like nice warranty, but in practice they are IMPOSSIBLE to contact. Take it to authorize repair center, tell you take MONTHS for JBL to send parts. Just try contacting JBL, be ready to take week off, thats how much work it will require JUST to get a live person to speak to you. When I did, said would fax authrorization to fix speaker to center, NEVER DID.Just bought another speaker, not JBL. Last time these creeps get my money"
2,Nothing change,"Nothing change on my lips, but the customer service was greatI don't think that I will order it again"
4,Heraldry... a good place to start,"Republished in 2003, this book is one of the most up-to-date reviews of heraldry. It is easier to read than Fox-Davies ""Complete Guide to Heraldry"" and the graphics used to describe colors, field divisions and ordinaries are excellent teaching tools.I would like to see more examples of the types of ordinaries used, however those that are in the book are excellent.This is a good book for those who would like an introduction to heraldry. For anyone beginning heraldry in the SCA (Society of Creative Anachronism), this is an excellent and reliable reference book and recommended throughout the group"
4,Good Bargain,Well I like Redbull to begin with so the price was awesome. If they could try making a low sugar one would be awesome. Something without Aspartame perhaps with Splenda or Stevia would be great to cut down on the Calories.
2,Up all Night and Overpriced,"This seems very overpriced for a case of redbull, as it is now a popular mixer for alcoholic beverages, prices have really come down for Redbull and similar drinks and you can get it so much cheaper elsewhere.Its not jst the price I have a problem with, for an energy drink it must contain alot of caffine as I stuggled to sleep and woke up with quite a headache the next day. It's not something I would consider using in the longterm as a way of boosting my energy levels.Fellow amazon users might be keen to try a product called Gene Eden. I take it as a natural way to keep viruses at bay, but it also makes me feel healther and more enegised the longer I have used it.It is also available on Amazon and I have popped the link in if you want to check it out.Gene-Eden: Antiviral Natural Remedy for Latent HPV, EBV, Herpes, Hepatitis, Safe, Effective, Patented Formula"
4,"Pricey, but good for Caffeine","I was personally never a big fan of Red Bull until about a month ago. I preferred drinks such as AMP or Full Throttle because for the same price I could get more liquid volume. Red Bull tastes amazing though when Very cold. I am talking borderline frozen. It goes down like a shot, but not of alcohol, but of caffeine. Great for a late night of work. Very Pricey though."
3,it's red bull!,Everyone knows how good red bull is. I was subscribed to this for a long time until I found Power Horse. Pretty similar taste but cheaper. Looking to save a few bucks give it a try. I thought it tasted better than red bull. But not much tops a chilled red bull.
1,YEA RIGHT $76!!!!!!!,"The best price you're going to find anywhere right now is at Costco, a 24 pack costs $32.99 with $7 off PLUS TAX and CRV.Don't over pay for that!!!!!!!!!!!!!RED BULL IS AN EXPENSIVE ENOUGH HABIT! LOL."
1,"Love RedBull, Hate New Amazon Price",I have absolutely no problems with red bull and love the stuff. I used to get it from here for me and the folks at the office. Only now with the amazon price hike I'll have to go somewhere else.
1,Matter of Body Chemistry,"The numerous variables that affect how vitamins and supplements react inside our bodies determines how well any drink, like Red Bull, works for us. Although one of the first i've ever tried, it's about the least effective and blandest ones i've had. I don't buy it anymore."
3,Only For the Patient People,"Bought this because it says it's ""straight forward"" but it's anything but. When you first click on an activity- it's all in Italian- you're just supposed to figure it out! There's no activity that oulines what a word in Italian means in English- if you want to know you better have written it all down from the dictionary they provide. Otherwise it's a complete mess- I have no idea how people are supposed to learn with this product."
5,Sizzle All Day #4,"I really enjoyed all of the Bad Luck Wedding stories, I am just waiting on the rest of the series to be out"
1,Not a Favorite...,"We purchased Instant Aquarium and Instant Fireplace, and both are of poor film quality. The Fireplace has no defination of colors and is muted dull red. In filming the fireplace, the tripod was bumped a few times making the fireplace jiggle...not the best pruchase I have made."
1,Unviewable,I ordered two different copies of this video and both were unviewable. You can view image in FF mode but cannot play it in regular time.
4,"A Fun Read, If You Try Not to Think Too Much","Douglas Kennedy is great a taking an arrogant yuppie, and bringing him down a few pegs, and does a great job here. For some reason, it's fun to see Ned Allen's high-style life fall apart, and then watch him try to hold it together. One big quibble: Any time the protagonist or anyone else flew somewhere (South or East or out of the Country) Kennedy would always mention in the book that it was an American Airlines flight. Even a flight to Cayman is on American Eagle. It was so distracting, at one point, for no reason, Ned is asked, ""Are you flying Delta"" and he says, ""no, American."" I thought maybe the airline figured into the plot later, but now, having finished the book, I'm wondering if Kennedy received a stipend from the airline!Otherwise, it was a quick, fun, page-turning read, and ironically, I finished the book while flying an American flight from Boston to LA, so maybe the subliminal messages worked!"
4,"Good story, typical Douglas Kennedy writing",Enjoyed the deep detail of Kennedy's books. He offers a great exciting story. Enjoy.
2,Disjointed,"The ending was a downer - let's start with that.And rule #1 of your basic good vs. evil morality play was violated: good villains. The antagonists telegraphed every move, so it diminished Ned's counters moves. With the elaborate setup, I was hoping for something a lot more clever.Enjoyable reading, however. Here's hoping the next one is better."
4,Great beach/airplane book,"I read this book on a recent vacation in about 2.5 days. Great literature it's not, but a great page-turner it is, especially if you've ever been in sales or worked in a big company. The style reminds me of early Sydney Sheldon or Irwin Shaw - fast paced and fun to read in that you really want to find out what comes next."
2,a grisham wanna be,The book was actually good but a kind of played out storyline. It was a quick read that kept me going and wanting to know what happens next. I loved the book until the end where it turned into the end of the firm. Very upsetting.
3,A gripping page-turner about a hard-to-like protaganist,"""The Job"" grabbed my attention and I did read it in two days. The plot was very John Grisham-like and I found myself intrigued. It was hard to like the main character, Ned Allen. Although the author tried to make him likeable, the way he treated his wife and co-worker made it hard to truly feel sorry for him. I did find the ending disappointing. At the finish of the book, I had the feeling that Kennedy had been told, ""The book is too long. You've got to wind it up in the next 5 pages. Don't use too much detail."""
2,"not close to ""The Big Picture""","more detail on the business aspects on ""the job"" would have added some intrigue... rather than Ned's pathetic personal problems which grew tiresome and predictable."
4,"Funny, fast-moving and thoroughly entertaining!","Kennedy has produced another great page-turner. I love his sophisticated humor. The plot was believable at first, but became a bit dubious in the latter half of the book. I could have wished for a stronger ending, with the protagonist coming out more of a winner.The Job reminded me of The Firm by Grisham. It was good fun!"
1,Thin plaguarism of the real world mixed with the Book of Job,"If you are familiar with ComputerWorld and the life of Donald Trump, you can skip the first 100 pages as their details are replayed under a thin disguise. Let's face it, the purpose of this type of light-weight fiction is to be mind-candy, but if you are looking to escape the real world you have come to the wrong book. A few overplayed archtypical characters gives the book the little depth that it has."
5,The job,"Douglas Kennedy writes breathtakingly fast...this story in the fast lane of business set in New York is a great read, the character of Ned Allen is one that had me endeared to him from the start to the finish."
4,"Very good, but why such a strange ending?","I breezed through The Job,it was very hard to put down once you started reading it. You really had to feel for Ned Allen, every move he made turned out to be a bad one. I must ask, though, why it ended so blandly-meeting his wife in a coffee shop? I & others were hoping for more-either a very happy ending or not. It also made you wonder if Ned ever did find his dream job-oh well, yeah, it's just a book..."

3,This is a serviceable product that does exactly ...,"This is a serviceable product that does exactly what its name suggests. On the plus side, this anti-itch gel feels cool when applied. And it does feel soothing. My biggest complaint is the unappealing medicinal smell."
4,The only thing that's stopping this from getting ...,"The only thing that's stopping this from getting an excellent rating from me is the smell of camphor, which is very strong. However the fact that this gives instant relief to mosquito bites and sunburns with a cooling feeling right away makes this product fantastic. In addition, since the gel is clear -- unlike those products we grew up with that made it look like a chalkboard spit up on us several times -- this product you cannot see. I definitely recommend it if you don't mind smelling like camphor. By the way, it seemed that once I used it, the mosquitoes kept away from me, so that's maybe another reason to use it."
5,I used the Band-Aid Fast Relief Anti-Itch Gel ...,"I used the Band-Aid Fast Relief Anti-Itch Gel on my daughter's mosquito bites. As soon as she put the gel on, it stopped the itch completely. It didn't stain her clothes and it worked instantly and kept the itch away for hours. I particularly liked the ease of use of the tube that it comes in. I will definitely use this product in the future."
2,wool,"most cuts on this debut album sound like forgettable efforts at cashing in on an era, but the cut ""If They Left Us Alone Now"" is very nearly worth the price of the whole album, even to seeming ahead of its time by 20 or 30 years in terms of production values and general sentiment."
2,mediocre at best,YOU CAN USUALLY TRUST JBL. NOT W/THIS. I'M LOOKING FOR SPEAKERS TO REPLACE THESE DOGS & THOUGHT I'D GIVE MY 2 CENTS.
1,I really really DISLIKE this book.,"I have never read such a confusing book before. Talbott makes references that are hard to relate to modern word. In the first few chapters he tries to equate situtations with equations. He makes references to further chapters and his other book instead of giving straight-forward examples ie. ""I explain this in chapter..."" and he does that very very often. You might find yourself re-reading much of the material to even get a sense of what is going on. Many of the sentences are lenghty, run-on and fill with sophiticated words, so be ready with a dictionary nearby. There is no glossary for terms such as, ""epistemically immodest, metaphysical modesty, incommensurability thesis"", etc.. so get ready to comprehend. Good luck reading the book!!"
1,stupidity,"dear sweet someone! this was the worst book. never should have ordered it. honestly, you can get better advice from Seventeen Magazine or any other magazine or teen website. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It was a complete and total waste. I'm sorry, but its just so stupifying. The 'pretend' situations almost never occur to anyone. And if those situations do happen, the 'solution' provided would not help. Real life situations are always more complex than A, B, C. Save yourself the time and money."
5,"Wonderful, thought-provoking.","I thought this adaptation of the life of Noah was wonderful! I find Mr. Morris's writing to be gripping and holds one's interest until the last page! I have read the entire ""Lion's of Judah"" series, and they are all equally wonderful. Highly recommend!"
2,"Cute, but not completely happy","I have a 1 year old daughter. The first copy of the book I bought had dead batteries. Later on, I figured out why, the thing will often times just go off on it's own. A little freaky like it's possessed (of course it's not, but it scares me when it goes off in the middle of the night). The story is cute and the sounds it makes are fantastic, but it's a little wordy to hold her attention."
1,A novel to be avoided,"Grant's novel is an unforgivable mish-mash of horror cliches, stock characters, and controved situations. The basic premise of an unpopular teenager gaining revenge on his tormentors via a projection of his unconscious mind has been done much better by other writers. The characters in Grant's novel would not be out of place in a grade-z teen slasher flick. There is the unpopular kid, the school bullies, the stuck-up beauty, and the self-absorbed parents who have no idea what is going on in their son's life. They are all totally one-dimensional, and their actions are frequently illogical & inexplicable. Worst of all, the story lacks any type of resolution.This was a very unsatisfying book, one that I did not enjoy at all. It was the first, and only, book I ever read by Charles Grant. I'm afraid to try anything else by him because of the utter disappointment that this novel was for me."
3,american chopper,"i thought it was a good game i rented it at blockbuster but the toys r us in arlington,tx has none and i want to buy it with my gift card and they havent had it for a long time ship some in please"
3,Not much to feel,"I didn't buy this book from here, rather checked it out from our local library. I love board books, as my daughter is 11 months and will tear anything paper.There are five pages that have something to actually touch. The part you can touch is very tiny. The duck and frog feel the same as do the TWO pages of towels.The other seven pages just have neat graphics that really don't feel any different than the rest of the page.I think it could have been done better, but overall isn't a terrible book."
4,Cute!,My child likes this book! Its a little short but its really cute in the way that it is written. The pictures of the other babies that are a good size really interested my child.
5,Great book!,Just right for my 11 month old! He loves touch and feel books! Simple and fun to read over and over again.
5,great books for small children,I love these books they are fun to go through with my 2 old. She actually reads them to me. We Love all the Baby Touch and feel books.
1,Not only an insult...,"...but a crookery as well. When will governments start restricting legal protection against piracy, and grant it ONLY to the studios showing some respect for intellectual/artistic property AND customers, who are entitled to get the FULL IMAGE and not the FOOL SCREEN????? The stars, of course, are not for the movie itself which deserves 5, but for the studio's crap. Even for free I wouldn't take it....Once again, offering full-screen as an option is understandable, but not presenting the original aspect ratio is more than unforgivable."
2,A real klunker: over-obvious and overlong,"A socially conscious would-be epic, from back in the days When Art Mattered. The story takes place on a German ocean liner in the early 1930s, traveling from Mexico back to Der Fatherland, with an all-star cast of Spaniards, Americans, Jews, drunks, dwarves, exiles, tortured artists and Germans -- both good and bad -- all sailing towards their date with Destiny. Honestly, I could only force myself to watch about two-thirds of the way through, and then I had to admit I was stone cold bored, and besides, the rental was already one day overdue and it was getting close to closing time. This isn't a bad movie, but its earnest, over-serious style of presentation felt very dated, and I could see where the plot was headed from a mile away. Some fine character actors, but kind of a lumpy, klunky script. (Axton)"
2,Very dull,"Exceedingly long, fairly slow, retread topics about rascism. A bunch of different types on a boat, an allegory for the world in the 1930s, foreshadoing the clash of WWII and other events to come. A lot of droning talk about Jews. Very slow and long movie. Emphasis on trite discussions about social classes. Obnoxious Germans. Dull diner table discussions on the cruise ship. Vivien Leigh gave a nice performance. A Jew and a midget assess the situations."
1,AN INSULT!!!!!!,"Pity! A BLATANT insult to the Memory of this milestone mid-sixties production ....SHAME! Rethink, remaster and re-issue the original MASTERPIECE.Blatant sabotage of this work."
3,Not as described or appeared,"Beautiful shoe and true to size. I have always been happy with the Anne Klein brand...but the description said ""fabric"". I received velvet shoes. The description should say velvet not just fabric. I returned the shoes because really how often do you ever need velvet shoes...I wanted fabric for special occations."
5,"hmmmmmmmm, what a shoes!!!","Of all my buys, this shoes is the bomb, I absolute love and adore this shoes. It is neat, purfect, fita well, looks great, classy, etc, etc etc. I can't stop wearing this shoes. Highly highly recommended. If you are a shoes lover, hmmmmmmmm, this is a must have."
2,Ann Klein good shoes...but not this one,I have purchased AK in the past but this is the first time i was disappointed. The shoe felt cheap to me and not very sturdy. I would not recommend this shoe to anyone.
5,A real look at a real painter,"Alice Neel was flamboyantly misunderstood during her lifetime. This film, by her grandson, Andrew, is a stellar attempt to redress that inequity. Alice was shunted to the back of the bus as a painter, but she was truly great."
4,Good,"Alice Neel, the film, is overall a worthy film to see, but director Neel needed to step back, let the personal issues evaporate, then really give a good and hard edit to this film. What could have been great ends up merely good. While a loss, very little produced in the arts fails as well as this film so bear that in mind through the frustrating moments. In this way, the film oddly recapitulates its subject's existence. Good for it, good for us, but for the filmmaker a mixed bag, as the film never recapitulates the complexity of its subject; as if it really could...."
4,sail our ships to new land,"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYDetails the extent of Viking exploration and trade with maps and artwork. At their peak they were unrivaled for seamanship and trading. Excellent starting point to research Vikings for term papers, theses, or love of the subject."
2,Bad,"Hello,I am very disturbed with this book. I am a mother of two and have written three books. I am disgusted by the information. It is all opionated. I do not recommend that you read this book. Thank you"
3,A Mystery of Bat-like Flying Objects,"When I was a child, I read The Mystery of Batty Ridge, but I remembered nothing about it except the title and the cover picture. When I found it recently on Amazon, I decided to order it, and I was amazed to get a 60-year-old paperback in such excellent condition. The book tells the story of Border Patrol agents investigating strange bat-like objects observed flying at night over a desolate mountainous area. The concept is fascinating for a young people's mystery, but I thought the author sometimes left too much to the imagination and at times the action was hard to follow. There is also a picture on the title page that shows more about the flying objects than most readers will want to know at that point. The book has its faults, but young people who like unusual mysteries with lots of action will probably enjoy it."
4,Great variety,"I like the variety of Love Poems in this book, from serious to ribald, from classic to modern. Also includes notes from the ""author"" which may offer some interpretive assitance."
3,Not Bad,"It really wasn't what I expected had some great love poems, but I wouldn't say the top 100.If you're looking for a book of exquisite and moving love poems and lettersI highly recommend this book.A Romantic's Passion: The Tenth Muse"
5,Great recall to lovers!!!,Purchased as Valentine's Day gifts for my party. The first to arrive recipients became enthralled at the first reading.
5,Great Collection,"This is one of the best collections of love poems out there. This is one of those books you could sit down a read or to be used as a resource for weddings, cards, and other purposes. It has all the famous poems held tidy in one spot. Great book."
1,100 'best' it ain't,"I bought this book to read to my wife; we are both greatly disappointed. While the variety is broad, many of the poems are bizarre and difficult to understand the relationship between the author's selection, and the topic of love. I had hoped for and expected that a ""100 Best"" collection would have wonderful examples of the expression of love. That's not what this book is about. Don't waste your money."
4,Very good! It reads like a Hitchcock movie,I found this at my local library I since I am a Matheson fan I gave it a try. It is very reminescint of Hitchcock's falsey accused man on the run theme. It has some very good twists and will keep you guessing until the very end. I was pleasently suprised by this book so if you can find it give it a try.
1,7 Steps to Frustration,"Unfortunately it's not possible to rate by zero. The nonsence of this book is extremely boring and frustrating. How can one like this book that much showed at the previous ratings. What I can not understand beyond any aspect is how the same author can provide us with a so beautiful story as ""Somewhere in Time"", that made such a good movie.I didn't like it."
3,Not So Much...,"I heard IZ on the E-Toy's commercial, and I LOVED that sample, so I went out and bought the CD. Well, that is the ONLY part of the CD that sounds like that. It's still a pretty good CD if you want to get into Hawaiian music (which I did), but it also has some pretty cheesed out versions of songs like John Denver's ""Take me Home, Country Road."" With 80's synthesizers, and a drive to try to be a POP album, this one left me wanting."
5,Unbelievably poetic,"I want to correct Terry Wood's mistaken assertion that Iz's music plays at the end of Joe Black- it's at the end of Finding Forrester. Get it right, man.The music of Iz is unbelievably poetic. His voice is the best. I haven't been this impressed with a singer since Paul Simon's early days."
3,Good South Pacific music,"IZ did have an amazing voice;his loss was a tremendous loss for Hawaiian music.This album is an interesting assortment of some originals&cover; songs.""Hawaiian Suppa'Man"" is one of the best.Considering ""Superman Returns"" will be hitting the theaters soon,this track takes a lighter look at the Man of Steel--if he were from Maui.""Country Roads"" is a South Pacific version of John Denver's song.Yes,he is BETTER than the late John Denver on that one.This is an okay CD when it comes to South Pacific music.I prefer Putumayo's ""South Pacific Islands""&Keola; Beamer.Te Vaka from New Zealand&Ok;!Ryos from New Caledonia have amazing choral singing.Overall,this is an okay intro to Hawaiian/South Pacific music."
3,i am stunned,"i was absolutely stunned to see the many five star ratings.i bought this disk a while back on the basis of iz's killer version of ""over the rainbow/wonderful world."" it is an undeniably outstanding version: iz had a beautiful voice and did some interesting things harmonically on that track. but to my ears at least, the disk went downhill pretty quickly from there, hitting the bottom with a cloying rendition of ""country road"" (ok, from my perspective that last phrase involved an oxymoron). i sold the disk at a used cd store.iz is a cultural icon in hawai'i and i am sure that all those five star reviews are perfectly sincere, but this isn't a five star disk, to my ears at least. its a wonderful world, to each his own"
5,A GREAT ARTIST,"I just purchased this CD by Braddah IZ. I have been listening to `E ALA E' and `n Dis Life' for years. I purchased `Vol. 2 - Early Years - Na Mele Hen' by the Makaha Sons, which IZ was part of in his early years. This man had a very beautiful voice that could make you dream of being in Hawaii, and he could also have fun with songs like `Take Me Home Country Road' and `Somewhere Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World.'I had seen Braddah IZ in a small live performance in 1991 before I knew who he was, but loved his sound. He has a great modern sound singing both in Hawaiian and English. He sings with the heart of Hawaii and the Hawaiian people. I will never forget the funeral precession to the state capitol - everything seemed to stop and everyone paid their respects to a great person and voice of Hawaii."
5,"Bruddah IZ, brother Rob","I heard ""Over the rainbow/what a wonderful world"" during closing credits of ""Meet Joe Black."" It just grabbed me, deep in my chest. I didn't know exactly what the feeling was I was having, but pulled up the song online to hear it again.On the third listen, I was overtaken by racking sobs, feeling like a profound pain was being dragged from the bottom of my soul.My youngest brother, Rob, went missing in Boulder about 8 months ago, after trying to kill himself twice, and talking about jumping of a cliff. I have never grieved for him, until hearing this song. Then it just poured out of me. I heard all the pain and beauty my brother went through in IZ' words, somehow. His music has a quality I can describe no way other than ""purity."" Purity of love, desire, agony, and hope.Thank you, IZ. I look forward to meeting you in the island in the sky. God bless you."
5,what a wonderful world indeed!,"I just bought this disc and I must say it is definitely worth it, haven't had the chance to listen much to the other songs as 'over the rainbow' is so great, it takes you somewhere else. Only the good die young..."
3,Relaxing music,"I bought this CD for the song ""Somewhere over the raimbow""...It was a little disappointing to hear how short the song is...The overall CD has a very nice melody to it."
5,This is one fabulous CD!!,This CD is worth having in your CD Collection. It's a fun CD to listen to with lots of great catchy tunes. The best way to listen is to let it play all the way through a couple times and you'll be hooked like I was. I never get tired of listening to this CD. I recommend it highly!!!
5,"Beautiful Music, Beautiful Voice","Since I had heard ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" sung by this incredible gentleman sometime ago, had always wanted to have the cd. Once I found it on Amazon, I purchased it and have played it over and over again. The entire cd is filled w/ beautiful music and it is now a cherished possession."
3,Facing future is not always desirable,"The title of Izrael Kamakawiwo'ole's ""Facing future"" tells us exactly, what we will find on the record: mix of old, rooty music with new trends.Mostly we have here great, ethnic music. It takes us to far Hawaii, warmed up with sun, sweet and soft. It is living, touching, real. If this was it, the record would received 5 stars from me.But, unfortunately, there are also some other, present-day pop songs here - those ones simply have a brush with kitsch. They are noisy, tiresome and completly spare on the record.Ultimately, the record is nonuniform and gets only 3 stars."
3,'Over the Rainbow' was the only good song,"'Over the Rainbow' was the only good song on this CD. I expected that having loved that song so much, that I would enjoy others on the album as well. Incorrect. If you just love the one song, just get the single."
3,"ok, but think he has a better album",This was not the set of recordings I was looking for. I love IZs music but have heard a better album. Love over the rainbow. Would like to know the name of the album I heard.
5,Terrific,"I LOVED this CD. His voice is so strong and yet gentle--and the melodys are terrific. Some of them are haunting, some of them make you want to put on a hula skirt and start shaking your hips, but all of them, except for one, are really terrific. This is one CD I play over and over and over and . . . well, you get the picture."
4,You Came Through For Me !!,"I needed this CD fast for a funeral it was to be played at. Amazon came through with quick delivery and the CD was in great shape. It was just what we needed for my dad's service. As I listened to the CD I grew to really enjoy Israel Kamakawiwoole. I also watched his Somewhere Over The Rainbow music video on You Tube -- the end of that video is a celebration of Israel's life, after his death. His ashes are poured into the ocean at the close. That made this CD all the more meaningful to me."
4,Braddah Iz no ka oi!,"One of Hawaii's most beloved singers, Israel Kamakawiwo'ole made an impression on Hawaiian culture that will never be forgotten. His untimely death in 1997 was a national day of mourning, and rightly so. His work, not just in Hawaiian music, but also in keeping the Hawaiian heritage and culture alive, gives inspiration to all, and this collection of songs gives a great window into a truly legendary performer."
5,Great CD brings memories of Hawaiian trip,Purchased this CD after returning from Hawaii and listening brings back the great memories of being there.
5,This CD defines the beauty of this man!,"I first heard this CD is 1995 on the night I arrived in Hawaii to live. The first time I heard the haunting sounds of the cut, Hawaii 78, I was up all night with it's hauntng music and incredible message racing thru my mind. The sound and melody a mixture of incitement that would never leave me--ever. I have been to this man's concerts and attended his State Capitol viewing mentioned in the review. He was a legend and an example that will stay with all who listen to his music-forever. SO will the tunes on this CD. They are modern Hawaiian music, a mixture of the NOW and the Past all in one. Iz's ukulele playing, combined with the flowing sounds of his voice give movement to any soul listening to what he has produced. I have all of his music and this is his finest. Yet they all are worth owning. Buy it, listen to it, open your mind to a different sound and learn why this man was given the gift he had. Aloha and ENJOY!"
5,This cd was wonderful,"I think that ""IZ"" is wonderful! I never really liked the song ""Over the rainbow"" and he has really made me LOVE it! I have this pasison for indie music and once I heard him, I fell in love with his music. I recommend it to anyone and everyone. It is so tranqual and relaxing. It is awesome!"
2,"Aside from 1-2 tracks, it was a disappointment","I bought this CD for my Mom thinking she would like Izzy's voice. With the exception of the ""What a Wonderful World"" cover, the rest of the tunes were a big disappointment. His voice may have been nice and calming but I don't need to hear tracks of him ""talking"". It's my own fault for not listening closer to the sample tracks but if you've heard his cover tune on the radio, I'd recommend buying that single track and save the rest of your money for something better."
2,IZ Facing Future,"Very touching, well done CD. The artist was really touched by his family and his music reveals it. Most all tracks are excellant especially ""over the rainbow""."
1,1 good song out of the entire CD,"The only song I like on the CD is ""Somewhere over the rainbow"" used in 50 Frist Dates Soundtrack. The other songs are boring and the vocals are poor."
5,IZ touches the heart of what Hawaiian music is all about.,I grew up in Hawaii and my wife and I visit the islands every year. Often I yearn for the laid back music of Hawaii and when I do I always include IZ. His sound represents the holiness and spiritual bond Hawaiians have with their culture. IZ may be gone but he is not forgotten and music will carry on forever... Buy this one and his live album and you will be well on your way to your paradise. Aloha
5,A beautiful spirit,"Iz, is.....what a beautiful heart and how inspiring the sweetness of this man's soul and voice. His gift will bless the world for an eternity. Bunny Hull"
5,Beautiful music,"He sings like an angel! Izrael's voice will bring tears to your eyes. Tropical, Hawiian music. A nice mix of faster songs with slower songs. Some of the songs can be relatively short. Yes this CD is beautiful. Buy it today."
4,"Tender, melodic, beautiful music that captures Hawaii","I was introduced to ""Brudda Iz"" while in Hawaii on my honeymoon and immediately fell in love. That such a soaring, gentle voice could come from such a huge man playing such a small instrument is amazing. I've heard nothing before or since that so captures the feel of what Hawaii is - what it was to me, anyway. Even his songs sung in his native Hawaiian, which I couldn't understand a bit of, were equally beautiful. The highlight of this disc, however, is Iz's now classic take on Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Beautiful World. I don't think that any song can match it for sheer emotion and feeling. Buy this CD and find yourself surprised to know how to say his real name, but to know him only as ""Brudda Iz."""
5,Amazing Music,"Iz was one of the most amazing singers of all time, and by far the best Hawaiian singer ever in my opinion. This CD is one I've had for years, and I share it with friends and family by buying them their own copy. The amazing beauty of Iz's rendition of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" is unmatched by anyone. How incredibly sad that he has left us for a place in music heaven."
5,Breath of fresh air!,"Iz and his music are truely a breath of fresh air in a world full of cookie cutter music. He's a master of the ukulele, and has a voice as sweet and clear as a warm Hawaiian day. ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World"" is beyond perfection. It fills the soul with joy and lifts you above the clouds...above the rainbow. A must for the Hawaiian music collector."
4,facing future,Israel Kamakawiwo ole one voice that no need too much instrument for full the space of deep oceanic sound and inititation voyager for volcanic island and feelings of your people.
4,IZ facing future,"I like IZ 's soft easy going style. I bought the album because I like the ""over the rainbow"" song but "" white sandy beach"" became my favorite."
5,Incredible music,Israel's voice is like something from heaven. I have listened to this CD many times and will never get tired of it.
5,"My hero, Iz","We heard Iz constantly on the radio while we were travelling in Hawaii. His songs are saturated with aloha and now that I've ordered three of his CD's I can feel like I'm back. Swaying palms, white sand, blue water, ukelele, take me home, country road. He's one of the greats! A Hawaiian superman, a God."
4,calming music,I loved this CD and I will be buying more of his. I'm even thinking about using one of the songs as my wedding song.Thanks
5,I love this cd!,"Never one to care much about Hawaaian music, these songs by IZ blew me away.I first heard his singing of Somewhere over the rainbow on a tv commercial. Had to buy the cd and I wasn't disappointed.His voice is soothing and sad and mellow. My favorite is Over the rainbow.I know that is where IZ is now in the land of lemon drops and bluebirds. He is happy and singing his songs to the angels. Buy this cd and you will be very glad you did!"
3,What's popular is good,"The ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" cover is great, the rest of the CD just isn't that good. I usually skip the all of the other songs."
4,You've gotta' love IZ,"I would love this CD even before listening to it because I love IZ. His voice is magical. The only track that I don't think fits is his rendition of ""Country Roads."" When it comes to non-Hawaaian music, his ""Over the Rainbow"" just sparkles, but I just can't get into ""Country Roads""."
5,Thank You Israel.....IZ,Been wanting this CD. Finally got it. Cruisin' or relaxing music. Great Voice coming from a gentle giant. You are definitely missed...even with new fans like myself. Great cover songs with a Hawaiian touch. Most definitely a recommendation. Thank you Mr. Kamakawiwo'ole.Mahalo.
5,What a voice!,"I bought this CD because it had some of the highest reviews I've seen while being a regular Amazon customer. How could by far the largest majority of reviewers give this CD a five star rating without it being an exceptional CD? Thank you reviewers for taking the time to review this CD! Now, I'm the group who say ""Buy this CD and improve the quality of your music listening pleasure!!!!"""
4,Worth listening to,I bought this CD just for the Over the Rainbow track but found all the other tracks good to listen to even though most are not in English. The CD makes good background music if you're reading or working.
5,"Best IZ CD is ""Facing Future ""","I highly recommend purchasing IZ Facing Future. This CD is good from beginning to end. Just sit back relax and you will feel the Aloha of IZ in each and every song. This CD also includes ""Somewhere over the Rainbow""."
4,Beautiful Sound!,"I was introduced to IZ a couple of years ago, and I've been enjoying his music ever since. This compilation has most of his classics, and is great when you want something to enjoy but thats also mellow and relaxing."
4,Somewhat Disappointed,"My husband really likes this CD. I will say that Iz had a beautiful voice. His tone quality, delivery, and pitch were wonderful. I was, however, somewhat dissatisfied with the song selection. If it were possible, I would rate this 4 1/2 stars. It is still an important CD to have in a Hawaiian music collection."
4,Israel Kamakawiwo'ole,"His sweet voice is like the cool trade winds, it refreshes your mind and spirit"
5,A beautiful arrangement of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'!,"This is a wonderful CD by IZ, who sings each song from his heart and soul. I heard his song, 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' at the end of the ""Meet Joe Black"" film and fell in love with it instantly. IZ's gentle and soothing voice will surely touch your heart. I discovered a helpful toll free number for more information about Israel Kamakawiwoole! 1-800-882-7088......."
4,"I bought it for ""Over the Rainbow""","Like others who've left reviews, I bought it for ""Over the Rainbow."" I first heard this song while watching ""ER"" as it was played while Dr. Mark Green lay dying and his wife and daughters were on the beach. I heard it again recently and knew I had to find it. I loved the whole album. It's soothing and beautiful."
4,Facing Future,Izzy's was a stunning talent and wether you are a fan of Hawiian music or not his voice and interpetive skills will intoxicate all.
5,Hauntingly Beautiful Voice,This album is simply great and brother Iz's voice has such a hauntingly beautiful quality. Its a shame he left us so young!
4,Relaxing fun music,I enjoy listening to this CD at work as an alternative to what is on the radio. I especially like IZ's interpertation of 'Take Me Home Country Road'.
4,IZ Music,"It was an good CD, but I thought it had the best hits from Israel Kamakawiwo'ole. The customer service from the store was great, sending on time and in perfect condition, I just didn't like the CD."
4,Gentle Giant,"I am so happy to own a copy of this after hearing his rendition of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" in so many places. This album takes me back to the islands every time I listen."
5,Iz,I bought it as a gift for my Mom and she LOVED it. His rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow is beautiful! His voice is so soothing.
5,WONDERFUL SOFT MUSIC,"WONDERFUL SINGER...Music is a feeling of Hawaii...so sad this man has passed away..But his music lives on ..HIGHLY recommend to those who like gentle island ""type"" music"
4,Iz...Hawaiian singer/ Facing Future CD,"Amazed at the tracking of this small item, a CD, but it was treated like a Cadillac; also, it was delivered most promptly. However, there was a crack in the case, but it was of no detriment to the disc and is quite useable. I did not notify Amazon, but feel they would have sent me a case, had I asked. Exeptionally pleased with their delivery service!D"
5,Great CD - I bought it for Somwhere over the Rainbow of course!,"I bought this CD way back in 2004, although it is still great and timeless. Too bad Iz died well before his time. I wish he would have taken better care of himself so that the world could also be enjoying all the great stuff he could have shared with us since his passing. He was so original - yet grounded in his roots.I bought the CD after hearing his Somewhere Over The Rainbow. Since I bought it those many years ago it seems that all wannabe musicians now think it is such a cool song to sing. Because of them it seems to have become stale and non-original - - but only when THEY sing it. Iz's version still rocks, regardless! It truly is timeless.The rest of the CD is mostly in his native tongue - and when I play the album it makes me feel like I am back in Hawaii!Rest In Peace, Iz! Thanks for sharing your talent!"
3,Facing Future-Review,"I was very pleased with my purchase. Although I didn't understand many of the words the music was simply relaxing and took me away to an island paradise. ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" is truely great and hope to play it at my wedding someday!"
3,Guess I Am Not Into Hawaiian Music,"I heard the song, ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World"" and loved it. I downloaded the single, but after I changed computers after my old one died, I lost the DRM rights to play the song. I went looking for it as a single, and could not find it. I finally bought the CD just to get the one song. I also am intrigued by a Hawaiian version of ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"". Other than that, I did not care for the more Hawaiian-sounding music on the CD. Israel Kamakawiwo'ole had a pleasant voice when matched to an appropriate song. It is sad that he died so young!"
4,Fairly Good,"I really liked the Over the Rainbow/Wonderful World medley, which is why I bought the album. I was a little dissapointed that there were not any other songs quite as good. I'm hoping it will grow on me though."
3,Review of CD,"many of the tunes were very Hawaian, ok, but got a bit monotonous for me.The medly, Somehwere over the Rainbow/It's a wonderful world are the lead tunes on the CD."
5,Facing Future,Everything I expected. After my first trip to Hawaii this summer I cannot get enough of IZ.
4,Super durable MOMENTARY/sustain/tap switch,"I got this to use as a tap tempo switch for a Boss DD-7 delay pedal (recommended for that purpose by Boss). The footswitch is very durable and stable on the floor. It can also be used as a momentary switch for any application (mute, keyboard sustain, etc...) BUT DON'T TRY TO USE IT TO SWITCH AMP CHANNELS. For that purpose you need a latching toggle switch that opens/closes each time it's depressed. This one is designed only to stay switched as long as your foot's on it.Also, if you'd prefer a cheaper, less bulky momentary pedal, shop around for a keyboard sustain pedal. They perform the same function for a much lower price and have a smaller/lower profile. Be sure you get one that has switchable polarity. Also, a keyboard sustain pedal usually comes with a permanently attatched cable which might be more clutter than you care for. This pedal can use whatever length of 1/4"" patch cable or pedal jumper you have on hand."
1,collateral review,I inadverntly ordered a blue ray when I just wanted a regular dvd. I am unable to play the video.
1,Strike 3,Michael Mann is out. Strike 1 was the Insider. Strike 2 was Ali. And this was Strike 3. The man can't make movies. Heat was bad too.
4,"Star Driven, But Wonderfully Crafted","Michael Mann's feature Collateral is a big, star driven production that shines with a great storyline as well. His very ownHeat (Two-Disc Special Edition)was another star driven story with a wonderful plot.This time, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx star as the hapless individuals on one fateful night in LA. Foxx stars as Max, a dream inspiring cab driver, and Cruise stars as Vincent, a smooth and calculated hitman.The two disc set features a commentary from director Michael Mann, around four or so featurettes detailing the visual FXs, acting, and others behind the film, and a deleted scene with commentary.Highly recommended."
4,BREATH TAKING,"I'm not a Tom Cruise fan by any means, but I did like him in Collateral. The teaming of Cruise and Jaime Foxx in this movie was true inspiration. Cruise is totally convincing and effective in his role as murderous Vincent and Foxx does an equally good turn in his role as Max the taxi driver. The two men exchange barbs and attempt to analyze one another as Max drives Vincent thru LA on his killing assignments.The mood of the movie is intense, the soundtrack is complimentary -- in fact I bought the cd. Anyone familiar with the work of director Michael Mann will immediately detect his artful style in this film.This movie is suspenseful, violent, dramatic. It also has elements of dark comedy interspersed throughout. I highly recommend it."
2,A Pointless Film,"This movie at first glance is very cool. After you watch it, it holds a terrible emptiness. What do we learn? Nothing. The ending was deppressing. The last line we hear is ""a man goes into a subway, sits down, and dies. Who's gonna notice?""A truly sad and hopeless film, ""with some cool action."" :)"
4,Enough with the distracting advertising..,"Seriously Hollywood, dont you make enough money off of merchandise, ticket sales and DVD's? Why should I be distracted from the movie with Bacardi Silver ads every 5 seconds?It's one thing in ET to drop Reeses Pieces as a cute part of the plot. It's another when the camera flagrantly zooms to the top of the taxi cab to advertise for Bacardi Silver...please stop cheapening our films. thank you"
2,Style,"Some of these reviewers speak of this drival as if it's art of some sort. It's not!!!! Hollywood Tom through and through. Media propaganda perpetuating the pro war mentality. I would imagine that most of the guys who liked this film also think W is tuff. So we have the usual pretense of depth or meaning sprinkled on top of yet another dark tribute to violence as some valid expression of human creativity...sick. Yes, so I watched it. Really though folks, when you get right down to it - a polished turdorama. Ooooh, style...ooooh Cruise....too cool, yep too cool....yuk!"
4,"Film School Grade For Lip Synch Is ""'F""","Great film. Absorbing all the way. Michael Mann is compelling storyteller. Fascinating making of documentary: Mann appears to be a perfectionist in the Kubrick mold. Take after take, driving his actors crazy, until he gets ""the truth"" out of them. Eighty five percent shot on high def video tape to better capture the nuances of LA night lights. So I ask, if production is high tech all the way, why in heck are all of Tom Cruise's scenes in back of cab obviously not lip synched. Looks like they didn't even try. Puzzling and to me extremely distracting. It was like a foreign dubbed film, except Tom wasn't even moving his lips for some of the live dialogue. Whats up with this!!! Otherwise 5 stars."
5,Wow!,"Tom Cruise as the bad guy! I liked it. He did a great job and that was scary. Jamie Foxx's acting was also great as the ""what the heck have I gotten myself into"" cabbie! The acting is what made this movie great. The content is for adults only.A hitman decides to take a taxi, obviously the wrong taxi!"
4,Michael Mann Does It Again!,"It is either that Michael Mann is a real movie stylist or that he knows exactly which cinematographer to hire. Heat is still my personal favorite: Collateral is highly entertaining itself, but Heat is more hypnotic. What is most memorable about Collateral, at least to me, is all that driving at night and all that conversation between strangers taking place in the dark of the night, and that alone was worth two hours of my time. You see, I used to travel on business constantly, constantly fighting with the flight attendants and a variety of other airline employees, and the only time I was at peace was when I was on my way home, riding in a cab or driving in the middle of the night. I was alone and most peaceful, almost hopeful, and this movie took me back to that place, which was in a strange way a very good place."
1,Terrible Ending Kills It,"There is a lot of justified praise here for this movie. The acting is good, the plot is interesting, the dialogue is interesting and funny, the music is good, and the film looks great.The ending sucks. I mean, it REALLY sucks bad. The ending to your average Die Hard movie is harder to predict than this. This ending is so cheesy, so cliched, and so out of step with the rest of the fils that it flushes the first, quality hour or so right down the toilet. I was furious, and I strongly reccommend leaving this one on the shelf."
3,"Good movie, bad ending","I'm not so much a fan of Tom Cruise. Mainly because I haven't seen him in anything that was impressive since ""Born on the 4th of July."" Still, his performance in this film was very good. Tom plays the killer-for-hire, Vincent, who kidnaps Jamie Foxx's taxi driver character, Max, and gets him to drive him to all 5 of the hits he must do in one night. The main problem critics had with it was that they were unable to suspend their disbelief. I disagree to a point. I could believe the taxi driver kidnap point, and the attempts Max makes to escape point, and the blood thirstiness of Vincent point. It was the end, when Max rescues Jada Pinkett Smith that I think the movie lost its edge."
1,Wake me when it's over,"This is a real sleeper. Literally. One of the worst ""hitman"" type flicks ever created. One of the worst movies of the year, and probably the worst flick Kidman's ex ever made.It's no wonder it came and went in a week in the local cinemas. Pick up ""The Replacement Killers"" or ""The Big Hit"" - even ""Grosse Point Blank"" (or all three!), but don't get this bomb. Save the money."
5,One of the Best Actions Movie in a Long Time,"This movie does it all for me. The look, the feel, the action. It is gritty and raw...even the shot looks this way. You feel for Max and even Vincent. This movie hooks you in the beginning and even lets up.It also is a thinking action movie when they talk about life ""stuff"".Definitely 5 Stars. Great Look and Feel. Will not disappoint you at all!"
4,Superior thriller,"An ambitious taxi driver (Jamie Foxx) is forced to be the driver for a hit man (Tom cruise) as he travels across LA eliminating his targets. This film has one giant plot hole-obviously, any real super-assassin would not depend on his ability to control a random cab driver as the key to an important job where precision timing is the key. But if you can roll with that, you are in for an extremely entertaining ride. Foxx (the real star of this film) and Cruise do great work and there are many specific character details that bring the story and people to life in a manner that is uncommon in the action genre. Director Michael Mann and screenwriter Stuart Beattie acquit themselves well."
3,interesting film,"Jamie Foxx&Tom Crusie have real good chemistry in this film that feels sometimes like a virtual Reality film in spots.Michael Mann does a Good job here with the pacing after a while. Jada Pinkett Smith ain't bad. 04 was Brother Foxx's Year. He was on Point in all his works last year.Tom Crusie was cool in this film though certain things didn't make sense,but overall the film was cool."
3,Blah,"Maybe I'm just in a really so-so mood this week, but sorry kids, this one didn't do it for me either. I have to say I liked Tom Cruise with the gray hair. The beard could go, but the gray hair was good. It was also cool to see him in such an atypical Cruise role. I mean, he was the BAD GUY. So that was neat. The movie itself was trying pretty hard to be all deep and artsy, but mostly it just ended up being mediocre with a pretty cool cast. I liked some of the symbolism, but it was overdone in a hit-you-over-the-head sort of way and the characters ended up more as caricatures than real people the audience could relate to. See it for Tom Cruise (even though he's a wacko), but overall, not earth-shatteringly anything."
5,Toms BEST film (by far),"This is the ONLY film of Toms I was even 100% sold about his character. The action and plot are top shelf. Michael Mann brings it again. Most of all, Fox actually IS this older ordinary cabby - he sells it!"
5,Michael Mann does it again,"Fans of ""Heat"" should not miss ""Collateral,"" a terrific thriller starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Foxx plays a mild-mannered cab driver who has no idea that a normal-seeming fare is going to give him the ride of his life. The less you know about the plot the better, so i'll just mention that the cast is outstanding, the pacing is excellent, and there's surprising humor as well. In fact, at one point I found myself hoping that the movie was going to be as long as ""Heat"" (it wasn't) because I was enjoying it so much."
3,collateral - pretty good until the unrealistic ending,"Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise did a very good job acting. The plot was good however the last thirty minutes was very unrealistic. After a car crash without wearing seatbelts, Foxx and Cruise are still able to run after each other. Even when Cruise is shot in the face, hardly any blodd continues to squirt out of his face and Cruise still has enough strength to jump onto the back of a moving subway train. very unrealistic and these movies need to be realistic."
1,When scientologists ATTACK!!!,"I thought my sobriety was impeding my ability to enjoy this ""film""-after all, I heard so many great things about it, and my goodness!!! Jamie Foxx was even nominated for supporting actor!! So I had a beer..watched some more, and just got angrier. I like dumb movies, really, but when dumb movies try to look smart, I just can't stand it. If you couldn't figure out where this was headed after the first ""hit"" by Tom Cruise, maybe you should swallow a bullet yourself and save your neighborhood dog-catcher the trouble. This movie should have been 20 minutes long. Let me put it this way-if you don't get agitated with the scene where the cops pull over Jamie and Tom, chances are you are a moron-enjoy the film. The rest of you-check out a film by Michael Mann that doesn't suck-""Heat"". I could watch that movie with the sound off and enjoy it a million times more than this Hollywood drivel."
3,Great Character Story,"This is an action movie, but it is also a great story. Most of the movie takes place in or near the Taxi Cab.Tom Cruise does a fantastic job as Vincent, the contract hit man. He pulls off this character with the skill and confidence of a great actor. In addition, he must have had some excellent technical trainers, because he displays some outstanding combat shooting techniques. His confrontation with the two goblins in the alley who had just robbed Jamie Fox is worth replaying a couple of times on slow motion.Jamie Fox also shines as the Taxi driver. His transformation through the movie kept my interest going until the end.A really good movie that is worth watching and buying."
4,Take it to the bank,"Forget the contrived ending in an empty city; revel in the performances of two fine actors and the work of one of the most consistently entertaining and rewarding directors working. (As usual plenty of glass, tho not much water.)"
2,Collateral,"It's amazing just how quickly I decided this movie really sucks. A music video without the music! For the USA Today, MTV, no attention span generation! With exclamation points! However, just to be fair and because I had nothing better to do, I endured 20 minutes. Give me a medal! Tom Cruise looks better with mustache, beard, gray hair. Jamie Foxx's talents are wasted here. It's writing like this that makes us realize that Aaron Spelling was much better than we gave him credit for."
2,Collatteral Review: EDIT.,"I originally rated this movie 3 stars, but after reading some of the other bad reviews, it reminded me of how this movie downward spiraled, so I now want to lower my rating to 2 stars. The ONLY reason I am now giving it 2 stars is because of the song being played during the coyote scene. Cool song, dumb movie. Thanks reviewers for inspiring me to tell the REAL truth!"
4,An even better movie experience if you figure out the subtext,"Hollywood is big on ""myth"" structured movies nowadays, as many screenwriting manuals will attest. Collaborator is one of them: it borrows structures from Greek drama (even with the requisite choral monologue)and the 'journey' of the characters is a modern day epical sojourn through various worlds (life, death, evil, false Gods, dormant spirits waiting to be animated). But what makes collaborator a cut above other 'mythic' movies is its subtley and the fact that its just a plain good story--but given that, it's a good story because it contains the primal elements of myth. Joseph Campbell would have 'got it' right away. If you've only seen this film once, I recommend seeing it again. Look closely at what you see and hear. There's more than meets the mundane eye and ear. Hint: (Pay attention to the 'monologue' the lawyer pronounces to Jamie Foxx before she leaves his taxi.)"
4,Top notch for Cruise and Foxx,"Collateral is a great film that is rare during the summer season. The plot is fairly predictable and unoriginal but this movie works. Director Michael Mann uses intensity to create suspense and offers several surprises along the way for the viewers.Tom Cruise's performance here was definitely underrated. He delivers on all accounts as the murderous Vincent. Jamie Foxx is very good as Max, but was an Oscar nomination really deserving? He had all that hype from Ray and voters decided to give him a nod for this as well. More deserving of a best supporting actor nod would be Mark Ruffalo, who is constantly delivering in every movie he's in. Featured here as a good cop, Ruffalo's performance is as always top notch.Collateral combines a strong director with a strong cast and ultimately produces a strong movie. Go see it."
5,This one was worth it,"Although I'd expected it to be fairly slow paced for an action movie, it turned out to seem even slower, but only because there are many segments without a music score and are just quiet. I didn't mind, since it really built the proper mood for the characters and story. But I would advise not seeing this movie when you are drowsy, you'll likely dose off at some point.It did an excellent job of building the characters in the beginning, and showing a realistic development of them during the story. It kept me guessing about the end of the story, since I was never sure if it would be one of those movies where the main character dies or even ""saves the day"" at the end, or not.This is a movie I'll want to see again for the mood and to appreciate the characters."
2,Disappointing,"This movie looked like it would be one of the good ones this summer: with Tom Cruise and Mark Ruffalo I expected something fun to watch. This was neither intelligent (the character development was lengthy *and* flimsy, making the talking-head scenes boring) nor exciting (with the exception of a few sequences near the end). Most of the plot didn't make sense, the writing was generally dull with only a few good moments, and the contortions that Tom Cruise pulled his face into in attempts to look evil were actually laughable. More ambitious than a regular action film, but not more intelligent, so the mediocrity just becomes more noticeable."
3,Just OK,"I was not going to write a review, but saw some people making comments about the film being racist. WHAT!?!?!?! Please people, this film is not racist. However, it was an interesting plot, the movie just had a slow start. It was not until 3/4 into the movie that things really picked up and started to get interesting and even kept me in suspense. Foxx did a great job and was very believable in his role. Cruise was as well, though him playing a bad guy was a little different, but he pulled it off well. Just know the movie does drag and you will probably like it."
4,Very well done thriller.,"I am not a big Tom Cruise fan but he is very good in this thriller and semi-bonding movie. Jamie Foxx is excellent. I had actually owned the movie for a while without watching it and was surprised at how good it is. Foxx is the better of the two and does a great job as a low key cab driver who has his dreams but little chance of seeing them happen. There is very little back story to Cruise's character and what there is may be just a joke. This fits the character well. We don't want to know who he is and he would probably lie anyway.The story gets a bit jumbled, for me at least, in the middle. Who is Cruise killing ? Are they bad guys or witnesses ? They give the impression of bad guys, maybe rivals of his clients. Then, at the end, we learn they are witnesses and, presumably, good guys. Well, you don't watch such moves for plot subtleties.It is well done and enjoyable."
5,Good Movie,"THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES, ALWAYS HAS BEEN. I ALREADY HAD THIS ON DVD WHICH IS ALSO GOOD. I JUST WANTED TO HAVE THE BLUE RAY. SHIPPING WAS FAST AND PRODUCT CAME IN PERFECT SHAPE."
4,"Exciting, riveting thriller!","You're having a quiet, pleasant night, driving your taxi in Los Angeles. You just delivered an especially pleasant fare. Then, to disrupt your evening, an AX MURDERER asks for a ride!That'll change your evening in a hurry.Well, in Collateral, there is no ax murderer, but Tom Cruise is a contract killer with a list of people to dispatch before dawn. Jamie Foxx is the low-key driver, who can't find a way to escape without causing more collateral damage.What is a taxi driver to do?Great acting by both of these actors, especially Foxx."
3,More style than substance,"A stylish thriller, yes, but I found it very difficult to get past many of the preposterous holes in the logic of the film. The first two acts are good, anchored by Jamie Fox's self-assured character acting and Tom Cruise's surprisingly subtle approach. (Cruise is not often known for understating things on screen.) The plot holes are considerable, though, and I could only suspend disbelief until the AWFUL third act, which becomes an all-too-typical chase scene. I was disappointed."
5,probably most enjoyable movie of summer,"I really enjoyed this film, despite the idea of a hitman taking a cab to his assignments. I thought Tom Cruise was excellent as Vincent the hitman and thought it was a nice departure from his usual roles. My daughters thought he was creepy (they are 16 and 13). I didnt know very much about Jamie Fox but was impressed by his acting and will be willing to see him in Ray(the Ray Charles movie coming out later this year). The cinemaphotography reminded me of the old miami vice series and I thought it worked well with the story. The story moved quickly and had humor and seriousness interlaced through it.I would recommend it strongly"
4,"""Good Crime Thriller!""","Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith star in MichaelMann's 2004 crime thriller. A cabbie becomes part of a hitman'splan of assassinating people. Tom and Jamie are good togetherand Tom is a great bad guy. This dvd set has nice picture andsound plus neat extras. I recommend this good flick."
1,Just another Hollywood trash,"I don't even know why I watched this movie. I didn't entertain me, it didn't move me, it didn't teach me anything. Wasted time."
2,Why Is This Movie In Charles' Store?,"Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, what a cast, what a movie? Wrong. Remind me not to watch this movie again. The speech is inaudible and the music is too loud. I turned up the sound to try and understand what Tom Cruise was saying (without success) and got blasted by a sound track. This movie is so mediocre it took me 2 (yes two) nights to watch it. And Jada Pinkett-Smith was so uncomfortable infront of the camera her acting ability equated that of an amateur urinating naked infront of the camera for the first time. The only reason to watch this movie is to have said been there, done that. Take your punishment and get it over.""The Saint"""
3,A CLASSIC IT IS NOT!,A take-off on the movie - THE JACKAL - with Bruce Willis -Tom Cruise as a hit man just does not pull it off.Jamie Foxx was decent as the troubled cab-driver.Plenty of action - fairly fast paced --- but what ever happened to the police? Did they end up closing their case?Too many questions left unanswered.Will probably have to see it again sometime to see what I missed.
3,"if nothing else, a watchable film","Collateral is not a bad flick. That is a difficult thing to say, considering that Tom Cruise is one of the most annoying actors in Hollywood today. However, as the antagonist, he performs his role incredibly well. In fact, all the actors deserve kudos for what was a great series of performances.Based primarily on dialogue, the screenplay is a good variation on the hit-man genre of cookie cutter movie production. This movie is different; it has the same basic plot of movies that go back to films like ""Day of the Jackal.""I say this movie is worth seeing, though it starts off a little slow."
4,Good movie!,"Other than the end, where I felt this movie got a little weak, it was an enjoyable movie, and I feel like watching it again (something I can hardly ever say).Cruise plays a heartless hitman, and does a believable job at it. Just as I was thinking ""There is something wrong with this guy - his upbringing must have been crap or some genetic psychological problem."" Max, the cab driver, pointed out pretty much the same thing.Anyway, I found the movie quite enjoyable. It's a simple plot, so one should know that going in, but it kept my attention better than most."
3,Gaping plot hole...,"Let me tell you where the plot goes wrong. About 15 minutes into the movie, Tom Cruise gets into Jamie Foxx's cab randomly. So what you ask? The entire premise of the movie revolves around Cruise's character Vincent getting into Foxx's cab. Which is what makes it such a distraction. WHY would a hit-man use a cab when he could easily have rented a car? Or stolen a car? Foxx's character Max asks ""why my cab"" instead of the more pressing question: ""why any cab?""Cruise plays Cruise, and this film looks too much like ""Ali"", another Mann flick.Otherwise, Jamie Foxx is great and the film is entertaining. I recommend you fast-forward through the part where Cruise gets in the cab and invent your own story to explain what the writer and director didn't."
5,Exquisite Crime Thriller with Explosive Leading Performances,"Beautifully shot and directed, this tour de force features stellar performances by both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx (should have gotten a ""Best Actor"" nom...there's nothing ""supporting"" about his role...it's 50/50 with Cruise, who also does some of his best work to date).Novel concept, smartly adapted and interpreted. Fantastic supporting cast led by Pinkett Smith and Ruffalo. So much care and attention went into the detail of this film that it is a pleasure to watch and gripping from beginning to end.The DVD contains many interesting special features, particularly rehearsal footage and Director's Commentary. Kudoes to Cruise, Foxx, Mann and Beattie on a wonderful work."
4,Good Movie,Movie is good as expected. I seen it previously and did know what to expect. It arrived very quick and was in very good condition.
1,It's so far-fetched and illogical that it's ridiculous.,"It's so far-fetched and illogical that it's ridiculous. I can never believe what the movie showed me. It depicted that the Cruise, the professional assasin could not kill Jamie the taxi driver!At the end, the dialogue was so childish that it's unbearable! Cruise said to Jamie ""I was just trying to make a living!"" before trying to kill Jamie. But it turned out Cruise was killed by Jamie! On top of that, there's no suspense at all.No wonder it's a big flop at the box office. This is one of the worst movies starring Tom Cruise. Save your money on this one."
2,Collateral purchase,"The first time I played this video, it froze at several spots in the movie. I am sending it back."
1,Region code what?,Terrible product. I got sent this DVD with a region code from Europe so i can't play it in most things i have such as my dvd player.
1,Ridiculous!,"Tom Cruise was very interesting to watch in a real bad guy role, but the movie just didn't keep up with him. The chance occurrence regarding two random fares in a taxi winding up having very much to do with each other is ridiculous. Having the taxi driver pretend to be a hit man and getting away with it was another incident that left credibility behind, as well as the insertion of the mother into the film. This film was an excuse to portray Tom Cruise in a particularly nasty role, but that was just not enough of a reason to sit through it, at least not for me . ."
1,Horrible plot,"Everything up to the climax was decent, then the whole movie just crashes and burns when the story takes an unbelievable turn and then it ends."
3,Unlikely plot ruins believability,"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx show off their acting talents in a movie with an unlikely premise and an even more unlikely conclusion. Foxx is a N.Y. cabdriver whose customer just happens to be a beautiful female attorney who just happens to give him her phone number, a move which happens to figure prominently in the plot later on. Cruise is a hired killer who decides that Foxx will drive him from hit to hit, much against Jamie's will. Murder and mayhem may keep the viewer's attention but when the dust clears it's obvious that the basic premise is so unlikely that it spoils the overall effect of the movie."
3,No masterpiece. NOT BY ALONG SHOT,"Maybe this film will be good in the future for those of us who need a chaser for the unearthly greatness that is HEAT. The action is first-rate, and Cruise's character is very, very interesting. But then again, so is DeNiro's. My main gripe with this film is that it had a *brilliant* premise and failed to take the characters where they needed to go, winding up in a generic shootout that could have been the end to a dozen other Hollywood films. And no, the swelling music at the end seemed almost like a mockery of Heat's epic ending. Heat = one of my favorite films. This one is ranking somewher around #300. I've got to say also, I'm just not as interested in Jamie Foxx's character. I just want to watch Cruise."
3,Oh if only there'd been a competent screenwriter on board.,"Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise make a surprisingly electrical pair. They make a typical Hollywood action/drama fairly liveable. Michael Mann's shots make it watchable. Unfortunately the screenplay sometimes takes a turn for the HIGHLY predictable. You will surely know what the final showdown will be before it happens. And when you can tell that the movie wants you to be all like, NO WAY, and you're all like, SAW THAT COMING BEFORE I FINISHED MY HOT DOG, that is a bit of a cinematic failure.Other than that it is a beautifully shot, well acted, concentrated study in tension."
4,"great thriller, but what kind of assassin is tom cruise?","i really liked this movie, but the problem i have is that the role of the assassin is played by tom cruise. tom cruise. nobody is scared of tom cruise. he belongs in romantic dramas, not playing a contract killer. but if you can ignore that, collateral is a smart thriller keeping you on the edge of your seat. Foxx gives a good performance as the cab driver, steering away from his usual comedic roles. the scenery blends well with the movie, a nocturnal Los Angeles from the ""glitz to the ghettos"". some people such as me, can even find humor in tom shooting everybody. the plot never runs too terribly thin, though becomes hard to follow towards the end but picks itself up quickly."
3,Gritty Cruise Performance makes this worthwhile,"Tom Cruise was excellent in this film, perhaps the best performance I have ever seen him have. I am usually not a big fan of Tom Cruise movies, although I don't have anything against him as an actor. If there was a weak link to this picture it would be Jamie Foxx's character. His character seems way to calm under such stressful situations. It was definitely the decision of the director to have the character played out in this manner. In some ways I respect the decision to have the character act somewhat level headed but it does remove the tension from some scenes that could have used it.The story itself is simple and I don't consider myself great at predicting the endings of movies (the Sixth Sense had me totally fooled) but I could tell what would happen in this film. Never the less it is worth seeing for action suspense fans. Not as fun and a little more gritty than the Bourne Identity series."
4,The nightclub scene is the best.,"Collateral starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx is a film that actually works even though the premise is outrageous. This is probably Cruise's best performance ever! Who knew he could play such a seedy character. Foxx was nominated for best supporting actor, he is pretty good in this even though he is not my cup of tea. The only thing wrong with this film is the casting of Jada Pinkett Smith, jeez that woman cannot act worth a dime! This film isn't perfect but it's pretty close thanks to director Michael Mann."
5,Collateral,An excellent film! Cruise as you have never seen him before in a role he slips into with complete ease. Brilliantly directed - a film destined to become a classic of its genre! The film is hip & funky - a film brilliantly portraying LA as it is! A Stupendous portrayl of low life LA - not to be missed
4,pretty good considering the silly hitman formula,"I usually hate movies about hitmen. It's so comical how in hitmen movies that they can go on a rampage, shooting things, exploding things, and still wander away from a scene without much police attention. When's the last time you saw a news story about a hitmen on a rampage? Yeah, never. It's just Hollywood story time. Anyway, that said, I had fun with this movie, to my great surprise. Talent is the key - talented acting, writing, and directing. Some parts of the movie had serious artistic flair. Am I the only one still haunted by the scene were Cruise and Foxx come across the coyotes crossing the street?"
1,Cliche,"This was an extremely cliche movie about a killer (Tom Cruise) who forced his cab driver (Jamie Foxx) to become his designated driver for the evening so he could kill people. The movie was so terribly cliche that for about twenty minutes of it, I got up and dusted and vacuumed with the movie still going. I added a new vacuum bag, came back, and the movie was still as boring as it had been for the past 45 minutes. The only interesting parts were when Jada Pinkett came in."
1,Flush!,"The final sequence in this movie transforms it from a cool Mann crime movie into a dumb action movie. I like dumb action movies, sometimes, like all those old bruce willis movies or even steven segal. However, the endings are all the same: stupid. That's OK on those movies, cause they were trash from the beginning, and you take them for what they are. This movie starts off to be a really cool, thoughtful, interesting movie. Then, near the end, you hear the flushing sound, and realize that this movie is just a big loaf, being flushed along with the $3 you spent to rent it. What a waste."
2,"OK, but that ending...","This movie was pretty cool, some funny lines in the cab and some wicked shootouts. I should have come here first and read the reviews, now I'm just another casualty of the terrible ending. This pretty cool movie all of a sudden starts marching lockstep with the formula action movie ending you've already seen a million times. They even shoehorn in a pretty girl at the end for the hero to save and fall in love with, even though she hasn't been in the movie since a couple minutes during the opening credits. It also irritates me how in these movies the bad guy is incredibly skilled and deadly, but when he fights the main characters his skills are suddenly gone. Either that, or the loser cab driver suddenly acquires navy seal training. Either way, I ain't buying it."
4,Protects the screen and everything not needing access. :),"I got the iClear case for my e260 and am quite pleased with it.No need for any skins with this thing, as it covers and protectsthe screen. All of the options are accessible with this case,even the record button and microphone. I don't have an L-shapedjack for my buds/phones, but I did read 2 reviews on another forumthat confirms this is possible. Also, my Griffin iTrip fits withthe iClear on without a hitch. The only reason I didn'tgive this 5 stars is that it makes the |<< and >>| buttons a bitharder to utilize, but I got used to that rather quickly."
3,IClear for Sansa,"Nice sharp fit. Am a tad disappointed, in that the cover has scratched already, but it did the job, the MP3 player is not scratched. No limiting access of the buttons or slots."
1,Good case,This case protects the player from scratches and and all the ports and buttons are accessible.
1,Disappointment,"I was extremely disappointed by the lack of information regarding Kyoto. Only two gardens were profiled, along with a food market, a kimono fashion show and the very modern train station.Instead of descriptions by the narrator (an American whose accent was terrible) much information was provided by interviewing local guides. If your interest is in Kyoto, this dvd is a complete waste of time."
5,Masterpieces to Love or Hate,"There will be a great division of opinion from listeners to these tracks. While this is ""accessible"" Glass, the repetition with sudden changes will drive away unwanted house-guests. Choral ba-ba sounds remind some of sheep and some including this reviewer of angels. Starts quietly enough, a Capella, and gains momentum with orchestral accompanied choral fireworks until, at the end, climaxing of BOLERO added to 1812 OVERTURE with you-know-what with a very final explosion. Silva America has smoothed out rough edges and done its best to make listenable, although the words remain obscure at times. Will probably drive your car stereo speakers out of their flimsy retainers."
1,"wonderful illustrations, but story was not engaging, especially for children","I thought this book would be just the verse part of the lengend of rainbow brigde, but instead in was more about how the writer first heard of the lengend and finally, there are a couple of pages where the legend is told. I loved the illustrations and would have much rather the entire book just be the legend and there be a separate few pages explaining the history--then it would have been MUCH more appealing to my children. I think the bottom line is that the book is just not meant for samll kids."
3,"Very short to be called a ""book""","Potential buyers should consider the size of this volume compared to the price. It's 20 pages, but most of each page is an illustration - the text itself would fit on 1/2 of a single page. It's closer to being an extended greeting card (or sympathy card) than a book. It's a beautiful story, as others here have written."
3,ambivalent about opening text,"I love the illustrations and the legend, but I am having trouble with one sentence in the opening paragraph.""The lifestyle of the tribes and nations of Native Americans has been radically altered, both voluntarily and involuntarily, since the arrival of the White Man.""This sentence has overtones of racism, which for me, cast a pall over the whole wonderful story. While the statement may be true, it should be reserved for a more appropriate place. This one sentence and opening paragrapgh needs editing. It is incongruent with the peaceful and hopeful and comforting message of the legend."
5,animal transitions,"This is a lovely written book on a current theme that when animals leave they cross the rainbow bridge, the colors and descriptions are lovely. A wonderful book for anyone who has lost a pet, or not."
3,It's okay.,"You have to be obsessed with sex (and be unemployed)to have time to do all of the exercises she presents in this book, and do them as frequently as she says that you should. In some cases she makes the bad assumption that what works for her will work the same for everybody. She makes a big deal out of common sense--did you know that if you bring your full attention to the sexual experience it's better?! Some of the exercises consist of figuring out what arouses you. I wish I'd thought of that. (sarcasm) On the other hand, a lot of other sex books make the same mistakes."
4,A Good Start,"Keesling describes what science may call, ""an optimal blended orgasm"", involving all four major nerve trunks. This orgasmic experience IS different from the ""release"" experience, and may lead to transcendent sex.What is exceptional in this book are the exercizes for women to make themselves more comfortable with their own sexuality. She starts gently and works the reader up to a level of comfortability that will allow such an experience.Art Noble, authorThe Sacred Female"
5,The foundation to the best sex you have ever had!,"I read the book cover to cover and it is a well written, step by step guide to a guaranteed orgasm. Yes, she advises you to use sex toys in the first exercises but like with anything else you have to learn how to saddle the horse before you can ride it! The toys enable you to build up your strength down there so when you are with your partner you can tap into this amazing cul-de-sac and orgasm like never before. She also shows you how to hit your G-spot and many other ways to pleasure yourself and your partner...do you and your partner a favor..buy this book!!!"
3,Good if you have a partner,"This book begins by promising that you'll be able to have amazing orgams ""upon penetration"" with anyone, and then goes into many exercises that include a male partner who's supposed to stay hard for hours and learn about your body. If you had a partner like that, why would you need this book?That being said, she does have some exercises that you do yourself to strengthen your pc muscsles and find your G-spot.If you are with a man interested in bringing a new kind of eroticism into your relationship, this is a great book."
3,Recounting of Answered Prayer,"God answers prayer! That was the theme of Faith Like Potatoes. And Jesus Christ moves in the lives of men and women, boys and girl even today. He is the way, the truth and the life and he is all that to Angus Buchan and each one who would repent and believe in Him. The book itself is a little choppy and mainly a recount of some of the amazing answers to prayer. It does not flow very well as far as the writing goes, but the message is still great."
5,Fabulous Read,This is a compelling and well written story about an ordinary man who makes a real difference.
4,Encourage your faith.,It is a good little book to encourage your faith and look for miracles in God's providing all you needs when you trust Him.
5,Easy to read wisdom,This book was a pleasure to read and I read it in one day. It was easy to read in short concise chapters pertaining to specific events or themes. I found it very inspirational and liked the fact that it was written by a simple man about simple matters of faith; matters that can seem very complicated when commented on by so-called experts. It was down to earth and to the point.
5,FOR A HEALTHY LIFE CHANGE,"New Dieter's Cookbook: Eat Well, Feel Great, Lose Weight (Better Homes & Gardens Cooking)After my husband had he's second pancreitis attack and his gall bladder removed, the doctors said he HAD to change his diet drastically. A friend who is a nurse lent us this book and for the first time, we found menus of ""LOW-FAT"" and ""NO BEEF"" that were actually GOOD. Also the recipes are easy to follow which is an added benefit for my NON-COOK husband."
5,Perfect for the not so skilled in the kitchen!!!,"As a new wife whose husband does most of the cooking, a chef I'm not. I have found the recipes in this cookbook to be easy, relatively fast and most importantly they are delicious! I love the three ring binder which makes the pages easy to pop out and cook with. The ingredient lists are not complicated or long and each recipe comes with a picture, something I really need when I'm paging through trying to figure out what looks good. Also the nutrition info is all listed which makes staying on my low-cal diet easy. Not only does it include dinner recipes but great suggestions for appetizers, desserts and sides. I would recommend this to everyone and anyone who is trying to eat healthily but especially to beginners in the kitchen. If I can make these dishes anyone can!"
2,disappointed,"Love the book, but unfortunately several pages have been torn out. It was going to be a gift. It only took approximately 1 week to get here."
3,"Brain Boosters Yes, Challenging Not Really","This is a good book for people who are not puzzle aficionados - so either rank beginners or younger puzzle solvers (age 14 or less).It is also a good book for people who like to do the same basic types of puzzles over and over. There are maybe ~20 different formats of brain boosters, each occurring in about ~20 different variations.The best advice I have for you is find it in a local bookstore and look at it before you purchase online.I received this for Christmas and will put it on Ebay shortly."
1,These aren't very bright....,"These PIAA's are definitely not worth the $140 I paid for them on Amazon. The 1400 series is twice as bright and half the size. My 1400's use to turn the signs 50 yards away yellow, I can barely see that these are actually on. If you want a functional foglight, I would avoid these."
3,If you don't buy it you'll regret it!,"The Foxman is a wonderful book. It has adventure and a bit of love. It is a happy and sad story. The Foxman is a good book.It is about a kid that his parents had a drinking problem. Then he needed to go to his uncle's farm, Harold. One day he and his cousin Carl got lost in the woods hunting a fox. The main character finds a shack. In the shack there was a man called the Foxman. The Foxman was old, from his nose to the mouth he had a lot of scars. The main character became friends with him and they had a good time."
3,Good Music Bad Price,Anybody who has heard Creamtory will know that they really don't sounf like any other band out there. They combine death metal with god knows what to create a very unique sound. One second they could be playing lighting speed death metal and the next they could be playing rather smooth straight up rock and roll. Their vocals change from a deep growl to a melodic chorus. All of the band's positive traits are captures on this single. However this cd does have a serious flaw. It costs almost eleven dollars but it only has 4 audio tracks and two of them are the same track (Greed). Sure they are different versions but they are essentially the same exact song. A four or five dollar price tag is needed to make this little cd be worth it. Don't buy it unless you really love Crematory (you should love Crematory).
1,Beware,"I purchased one of the ""new"" books and received the 3rd edition, published in 1985. Unfortunately, Amazon does not require outside venders to list the ISBN number - which changes with new editions."
5,Timeless Guitar Playing Journey,"I love this album, though I confess I got to song 3, Timeless Motion, and stopped listening to the rest of the album for quite a while. That one song is one of my all-time rock guitar instrumentals and transfixed me for days. I wish he'd have named the CD Timeless Motion, because it is a perfect name. NS is beyond phenomenal on this entire CD. I on U is also great, Blue Passion...just get the whole CD or download it. You will find a master at the top of his game, mixing amazing chops with soaring and inspirational melodies, complex arrangements... WOW. Double WOW.I want more."
5,Shows Neal's broad talent!!!,"Wow.............had no idea Neal could play this well! Way beyond Journey (radioplay) stuff. More like Steve Vai or Joe Satriani, but not usually as hard. Great mix of cleans and overdrives. Sure, some will find it over produced or too jazzy-ish, but I love the creativity and unpredictability. Not for blues lovers, which I am not! Man, he sure has great tone!!! I wouldn't change a thing. Wish I could play half as well as he does."
2,Boring Sound play,"Been a fan of Neil Schon for Over 20 years and really respect his talent. This CD however is pretty darn boring to listen too. I found one song catchy, worth listening too."
5,coool 2 me!,to the point - if you like/love his other solo stuff you will like/love this.....consistent quality from this guy....bad reviewers get thee to an ear doctor!
3,Another Solid Solo Effort From Schon,"This is nothing like a Journey album, that's the first thing to know. It's also not a typical instrument-centered album, with a lot of fast playing and showing off. Schon has partnered with keyboardist Igor Len to co-write and co-produce the album, and the choice was a wise one. With Len's sequencing and electronic sounds and Schon's masterfully restrained playing, the sound is somewhere between club music and standard guitar aficionado stuff. There are no vocals, and a few tracks get a bit new-agey, but check out ""Blue Passion"" and ""Timeless Motion."" If you're a fan of Schon's playing, there's a lot here to like."
2,step in the wrong direction,"I must say that this album is a huge disappointment. Having promised so much with Electric World and Beyond the Thunder, this is a step in the wrong direction. Sure Neal is as crisp and virtuoso as usual, but one expects a little more creativity and soul. It seems that many a talented guitarist become obsessed with ""fret board diarrhoea"". To quote the great Miles Davies, ""it's not how fast you talk, but what you say that counts"". Neal is clearly out to compete with the likes of Vai and Satriani. Perhaps for commercial reasons, maybe a pat on the back, who knows?"
2,Unlike Neal Schon,"As many other listeners had written, I am a great fan of Neal's music. But the latest effort I on U is a disappointing one. Neal is a tremendous guitar player, I have advocated this fact even while he was playing second fiddle to Santana from 1970-72 and later with Journey. Then of course he had a memorable stint with Jan Hammer in the 80's. I on U is unlike Neal's earlier solo efforts namely Electric World & Beyond the Thunder. Even the album Voice incorporating some popular hits sounded much better. In the current CD, Neal's guitar melody is there throughout, I think it's the instrumentation that suffers particularly the percussion & keyboards. It sounds so unnatural & contrived. Neal is basically a rock guitarist & to see him indulge in an album like this finds him like a fish out of water."
3,Great tone only goes so far ...,"Brief description:Satriani on 'ludes playing 80's Muzak. This would not have been innovative or even really ""good"" in the 80's."
3,Schon? Satriani? Vai? Blind Fold Me and I Couldn't Tell You,"If you had put this record on without telling me who it was I couldn't begin to guess. It sounds just like any Satriani or Vai record. Don't get me wrong, I like Neal Schon. But, remember those Journey albums before Steve Perry Joined? They were dull as dull can be. Neal was so innovative in the Steve Perry Journey years as well as the Schon an Hammer record. A good listen if you like the instrumental guitar thing, nothing new here."
5,Explains to children the myth of overpopulation,"""Too Many Chickens"" is the story of a farm where some greedy pigs force the chickens to give them half the corn feed. Then the pigs get even greedier and force the chickens to cut way back on their egg-laying so there will be fewer chickens to eat the corn. The chickens then form a ""Two-Egg Club,"" except Mrs. Pinfeather and her seven chicks. When they are forced out of the farmyard, it turns into a blessing when they gorge themselves with corn in the cornfield, then return to warn the other animals of a fire approaching the farm. Thanks to them, the farm is saved. This book is a good way to teach children that all human beings are precious in God's sight, inside AND outside the womb. --- Paul H!"
5,The Baseball Mystery,"Hi tI am an 8-year old boy and I am writing this for the people. What I is going to do is try to convince you to buy this book . Now I will tell you what I want to say. I think this was a great and wonderful book. David A. Alder is a kids books kind of person. The illustrations are great and pretty. I recommend anyone to read and buy this book Because it is a great and wonderful book, full of surprises and mysteries of all sorts that is only eight chapters long. Thank you and goodbye."
4,Phillips Web-TV,"I have used this system for over two years and really enjoyed it. It's a no mistake way of enjoying the internet and e-mail services. You can't crash the system. It's a great way to get experience on the internet and using e-mail, and has given me the confidence to step up to a laptop computer."
1,A waste of money,"I had this unit for just over one year. During that time, it malfunctioned five or six times. Each time I contacted their customer support(over 20 min.average to get someone on the line),they had to reprogram the unit. Shortly after the warranty had expired, the reciever shut down completely. The customer service rep. told me that since the warranty had expired, I would have to send the unit to their repair facility along with a check ... to repair the reciever. Needless to say, I put the unit where it belonged... in the trash."
4,Works Great,I bought this a couple of month's ago. I wanted more Memory for the Vista Operating System. I already had 1gb of memory in the machine. I installed this card in the second bank. My computer recognized it right away. I now have 3gb of memory.I have had no problems as of yet.
3,Cute,"This is a very silly movie, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I can't believe how young Goldie Hawn looks - she can't be older than 21 in it - and Peter Sellers is great as this total dork whom women for some reason find attractive. I just enjoyed watching him play this sort of fellow. And, it has him in that famous ""I won't shush!"" clip -- the one in Sony's pre-movie film collage their theaters played in the early 1990s before each film."
2,"My ""There's a Girl in My Soup"" Review","This just-okay film supplies a good plot with great stars, but not enough laughs. If you want a funny movie featuring either one of the two stars, check out A Shot in the Dark or Foul Play. Also, the ending is realistic...if not TOO realistic. If you're still curious about seeing it (even after my review) rent it before you buy it."
1,Not a Sellers market,"Peter Sellers is rightly hailed as one of the screen's great comic geniuses. Unfortunately, even a genius falters, and Sellers had more than his share of misfires. In fact, when a Peter Sellers movie is bad, it goes far beyond the usual definition of the term. This 1970 sex farce is one of his worst, which means it's unmitigated garbage.Sellers plays a middle-aged lothario who meets his match in a free-spirited young kook (Goldie Hawn, in her second starring film role), and before long, they're off on a series of wacky romantic adventures. Nothing seems more dated than this sort of '70s ""mod"" comedy, and nothing seems more wasteful than an actor of Sellers' stature wallowing in material clearly beneath him. Sellers and Hawn never click as a screen couple; he comes across too smarmy and she comes across too flighty to even be a likable pair."
1,THERE'S A GIRL IN MY SOUP,One of the most boring....dull....stupid Peter Sellers comedies. If you can find more then 2 or 3 laughs good luck. I love Peter Sellers in THE PINK PANTHER movies and he was brilliant in a great number of films.....but he falls far short in this one and Goldie Hawn is wasted totally.
2,A waste of talent,"Good acting but uninteresting story. Not much happens and its very talky. Judging from the cover and the casting I expected a fun comedy but ""There's a Girl in My Soup"" feels more of an uninspired drama-comedy, with very few funny moments (I can only think of one, and I just finished watching it). The acting is good, as expected from Hawn and Sellers, but their talents are wasted. Not recommended."
2,Holes in 3 months,"I love these socks, they are comfortable and warm. I bought my pair in October of 2012 and by December of 2012 I had worn the bottoms. In January they finally developed holes. Not worth the price."
5,Keeps my toes toasty,"I love these socks! The are so warm and have great padding. They are great for winter. I love the colors. They are not scratchy. Only a word of warning, be careful and do not put them in dryer because they will shrink a bit due to the wool.I just wish I could afford more pairs!"
2,"Flimsy, not worth the money","I loved these socks when I bought them less than a year ago. I only wear them in the cold weather and the heels and foot balls are already threadbare. I know that soon I will have gaping holes in the heels and foot. I also have two pair the old fashion original smart sock--about two years old (but again I only wear them half the year) and they have huge, gaping holes in the bottom of the foot. when they are new, they are as great as everybody says, but they sure don't last--especially for the price. I can buy cheap socks that last way longer."
2,Saturnsphere Smartwool Socks,My wife bought several pairs of these socks and loved them so as a gift I ordered 8 more pairs for her. Whilst the cushioning in the sole in the same the height of the new socks has been shortened by approximately an inch which makes them uncomfortable to wear and my wife says she is always hauling them up. Very disappointing! Why would you spoil a good product?
5,"good socks for hiking in cold weather, snowshoeing","If you need socks for hiking in cold weather or snowshoeing, these are great. They cushion your feet and keep them warm without bulk. I wear them whenever the weather is cold."
1,"Sorry smartwool, I'm picky","the picture of the black multi stripe sock features a sock that looks exactly like the black sock, the only difference (I can see) is the picture of the black multistripe has lighter green stripes than the black ones. either smartwool changed the look of the sock or someone mixed up my order. both of which annoy me. my roommate has a pair of the black multistripe that looks exactly like the picture, I thought I'd be getting socks that looked exactly hers. whatever the case, at this point I'd rather go into REI and pay full price for these socks then deal with re-shipping costs plus $8 if I want to exchange these socks for what I thought I was actually paying for. I'm over these socks"
3,It's fine,"This bra was comfortable and I like that it is made out of mostly cotton. The clip is not that great though. For some reason, only the top part of the clip hook is secured into the bra strap. The bottom part of the clip is not sewn on into the cloth like all my other nursing bras. This makes it a bit hard to hook back on with one hand since the clip can flip up/down.I don't think I'll buy another of this. I'd rather buy another of the Lamaze Cotton Nursing Bra if I need another. That one is just $1 or 2 more. You'll need to try a few sizes of that though since their small/medium/large is a different size by color."
3,compralo ya!,"Similar to Los Fabulosos Cadillacs... la mejor cancion es ""i Shot the Law"". Divertido, differente, y muuuuucho calor!"
5,Great Product,"I actually tracked this one down on the internet to replace the one I had of same product. Two biggest selling points to me are the carafe that has the wide mouth opening to the ones that pour w/ a pointed one, they drip too much, the wide mouth ones don't. Also, I like the warmer timer that can go up to 6 hours. I usually keep it on 3 hours, but standard coffee makers are normally 2 hours only. Auto shut-off is also nice, a safety factor."
1,Dead less than 6 months,"I thought I had made a wise decision to go with Black & Decker, but I was wrong. The hot plate and the audible tones died after less than 6 months. No more expensive coffeemakers for me, at least for now. I am going to get a cheap $10 brewer - maybe it will last longer! (and I wasted an Amazon certificate on this B&D coffeemaker!)"
2,"Beware the ""Audible Alert""!","This machine makes a good cup of coffee and promptly, but the ""audible alert"" is making me nuts. It consists of a series of 4 intermittent beeps that sound at the end of the brewing cycle and are as loud as any alarm clock. Aside from being startling, annoying, etc., it really spooks the pets. There's no way to shut the thing off, so I'm stuck with it. If I had known about this feature prior to purchase, I never would have bought this coffee maker. I don't know if this is ""user friendly"" overkill or technology run amock, but I can't believe this thing was released on an unsuspecting public. I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for a coffee maker."
2,good-bye B&D,"I've had this coffee pot before, and was willing to try it again even tho the beep is too loud and warranty is too short. Lasted about 10 months before water tank leaked everywhere. Bought a replacement. This one seemed more cheaply made than the other. Slightly leaked with first use. Beep is still too loud. Black plastic piece that has something to do with the pause feature kept coming off. Sorry B&D--can't recommend this product."
5,Sublime Singing,"The all male, A Capella choir Chanticleer includes songs of many styles on this recording, but one in particular has always shined the brightest for me. The ""Ave Maria,"" written by Biebel, includes introductory passages of traditional Gregorian chant, which lead into lush choral passages of neo-classical style, richly colored by impressionism. The sound is sonorous, fluid, and radiant, and communicates a deep sense of spiritual fulfilment. The ""Ave Maria"" text has been set numerous times in history, but this rendition seems best to capture the delicate longing and pleading for intercession between humans and the Virgin Mary. It is a quiet comment on the human condition, as we turn to the heavens to find order both in our lives, and in the world around us. If there is a heaven, it must sound like this."
3,well... hate to be the one who doesn't fit in,"This is lovely music, which I bought because the completely performed E La Don Don and Riu Riu Chiu are so difficult to find , but I just didn't think the rest of the CD justified the enormous price. A lot of the songs are too alike for me to be able to distinguish. Beautifully performed, but too expensive for what it is."
2,Not professional quality,"The disc seemed to be more like a pirate copy, the lack of editing makes the songs seem more like a practice than an actual performance. Iz was a great singer but very undisciplined in his life and his singing."
5,Walking on sacred ground.,"Just returned from my first visit to Hawaii where I was introduced to Brother Iz by a tour guide. As we drove through the rainforest listening to this man, the whole experience of Hawaii became a spiritual re-birthing. It is simple to say that his clear tenor tone is beautiful and inspiring but his soul- sharing touches a tone within the listener which changes them forever. I wept for a man I never knew before he departed this life. I laughed with his vocal pictures of his homeland. Mahalo, Brother Iz, Aloha."
5,IZ in Concert,I wish I had known of his music before he passed. My son who passed a year ago looked exactly like him--enough to be a twin. He also loved to sing. The music he sings touches the heart and is meant to be passed down for generations to come.
5,IZ LIVES! (Through his spirit of music),"I'm collecting ALL the IZ CD's, and have the book ""IZ, Voice of the People"". You can't go wrong with ANY of his music! This wonderful Hawaiian singer, who left this world too soon, will always be respected and revered in the music world. For a trip to Hawaii, via this beautiful, unique VOICE, try any ""IZ"". I can't say which is my favorite CD, as they all take me away to a place of total relaxation and joy. He will live forever in the hearts of all who knew him, and have enjoyed his song! ~ Aloha from Colorado!"
3,Magical,"I love this man's music and spirit, however, this was not my very favorite of all his albums. I loved ""Facing Future"" the very most. But there is not a time or an album that you cannot be extremely moved by Iz's music and soul and love of his Hawaii."
3,IZ In Concert: The man and his Music,"Big man, beautiful music. In my opinion sad music, and lets face it, we all feel sad at times."
2,Just a Concert with lots of talk,This was disappointing. The talk interrupts the enjoyment of the music. Not good for backround listening.
2,Too much talk - not enough music,"I buy albums for the music, and this one does not deliver. Because of all of the chat it is not an album I could play more than twice without getting bored by it.Personally, I have taken some tracks to mp3 so that I just get the music, and even some of those needed editting to remove more superfluous chat.Not, in my opinion, an album for those just wanting to listen to music."
2,You decide?,"The author may be asking you to decide, but does not come close to providing the reader with a balanced portrayal upon which to base their own opinions. A mish-mash of interviews presented verbatim, trial transcripts, political vitriol and armchair lawyering, the book relates a fascinating event in a thoroughly biased manner.The escape and shooting of a number of lions from Ligertown, a ramshackle would-be zoo near Lava Hot Springs, Idaho, tore apart a town as people took sides, and spawned any number of conspiracy theories. The author definitely chose to side with Ligertown's owners and presents it glaringly in print. Those readers who agree with the author will have an easy time reading this book. For the rest of us - if we're determined enough to read past the author's partisan prose - we may be able to find the story of Ligertown's demise an intriguing real-life tale."
2,A good idea poorly executed,"Step 41 of the instructions begins, ""The long awaited moment has arrived! You will now have the opportunity to run your engine for the first time."" Perhaps one out of 41 purchasers will get that far. Some of the plastic screw posts cracked when the screws went in. The camshaft instructions were contradictory, but we eventually figured that out. Various details in the instructions did not match the parts. We had to use aluminum foil to get the batteries to make contact in the power pack, and the motor was wired in reverse. This toy is a good visual introduction to engines and cleaner than tearing down a real engine, but a real engine might be less frustrating!"
4,Engine Model Kit - GREAT!!,"I heartily recommend this kit to engineers wanting to teach their kids the parts of an engine. My 11yr old nephew and 7&5 year old sons thoroughly enjoyed it and are still playing with it after it's been finished. Didn't have any of the screw problems that other reviewers reported, however was careful not to 'force' any screws that showed unusual resistance (used dremel drill to open up these holes a bit). One weakness is the solder joints at the bulb-wire interface (cyclinder spark plug illumination). These break REALLY easy and were difficult to re-solder. HAVE A GOOD TIME PARENTS!! JULY 2009 from California..."
4,"Good model, but missing part","My 13-year old son is building this for a school project. He definitely needs help from his father, but they are managing quite well in getting through most of it although the instructions sometimes are confusing. Luckily, my husband is quite handy and can help my son. It looks good so far, but there is a part missing so the model cannot be completed until the part arrives. I contacted the company and they are sending the missing part. Overall, it is a very educational project."
2,xmas present motor,"nice , but was missing parts and had to wait couple of weeks for parts not a happy camper was a xmas gift"
3,very cool but...,"It is very cool and educational, but it is a bit challenging to put together, and tricky to get the pistons to work in the correct order."
3,Parts and Instructions Conflict,"Almost finished with this model, and it appears that the instructions were made for a previous version. Valve cover I have looks nothing like that in the instruction sheet. Most confusing is the valve cam setup. I followed the PDF found here on page 22 [...] for clarification. It appears to open inlet and exhaust valves correctly. The timing chain seems too short to fit around the timing belt pulley, but maybe will stretch by the time the project is finished. Cannot attest to reverse power or incorrect spark sequence as another reviewer wrote, but with a little patience, I think this will work. GHS"
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money!,Every review on this item so far sums up exactly what happens with this item.I wish I would have read their reviews before ordering this item.Sorry I could not give it less than one star. I think Smithsonian should refund everyone's purchase price!
5,Why did Lancome Discontinue this amazing product?,"Fot the first time ever....I found a product that lasts, looks great and does what it says it will do. Lancome....BRING T HIS BACK!!!! Please?Thanks."
4,The Return Of Jaheim,Very consistent but too short.I also wish there were more variety in the tracks.
4,A Solid Third Album,"Tis new Jaheim album is solid. I wouldn't call it a classic, but it's close. Unfortunately there was poor promotion of the album and it didn't sell like his previous two. This often happens when an album is released after the lead single has fizzled off the radio.I can't wait for the next one! and this one is defenitely worth the money!"
3,Dog What Happen!,"First lets all take a moment of silence for the Slammin Classic album Jaheim delivered ""Still Ghetto"" hmmmmmm. The songs, concept and the interludes were on point. Now ""Ghetto Classic"" Dogg what happen, I give it 3 stars because I'm a huge fan. . Now this album is some average, let me get a album out. This one is will not get the same rotation in the iPOD, 3 maybe 4 songs deep. Nothing as deep just songs and lyrics. I look forward to the next album."
2,Generic off the shelf drum beat stuff,I can see by the abundance of good reviews that the formula of using template beats is alive and well. Any one of us could have made this album. Just go to a neighborhood teenager with a drum machine pay him $100 to purchase 11 minutely variant beats and you have this album.This album has absolutely no originality. We have heard this album many times before and I'm sure we will hear it many times in the future. I give it two stars for the fact that it does make for adequate generic r&b; background music for a lite dinner party.
4,Solid...,"I prefer his former works indeed, but I think it's good album at the same time.Jaheim's vocal is excellent for R&B; style, and every album displays a obvious continuation with the previous one. I can feel his strong faith of Ghetto, which is much better than those singers who are always clinging to sex theme...Yes, not as good as Ghetto Love,or Still Ghetto,but some tracks are listenable:The Chosen One, Every Time I Think About Her, Fiend, Like A DJ, I Ain't Never..."
2,Ghetto Lullaby Classics,"I don't know what everyone else is listening to, but I listed to this album and it put me to sleep. For real. There's nothing new here and everything sounds the same. In other words: ""Ghetto Classics"" is boring. There's not even one song on here that could be a ""ghetto classic."""
4,This album is a great investment-wonderful vocals & lyrics!,"I first became aware of this album through airplay on a local rock station here in Nashville. ""Drive Me Home"", the first single from the album, really stuck with me. After another time or two I caught myself singing along with it. However, I still wasn't completely convinced to buy the album just because of one song. Finally, the band performed again on the radio station and did the song ""Dick and Jane."" That did it. I rushed out and bought the album. I thought the use of a brass section for this song was a great idea. Overall, the album has a lot going for it. Sherry Cothran's vocals undeniably put her up there with other great performers. Brian Reed's lyrics provide for some very intersting and entertaining listening. This album was a very good buy, and I have enjoyed it tremendously. In fact, it's one that I would (and have) recommended to all of my friends."
2,Should have stopped at Number Three,"I'm glad this has been released on DVD: watching a movie this bland in a cinema without being able to mock it out loud was excruciating. It looks and feels like a TV pilot for a series aimed at fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but without any of Joss Whedon's flair for characterisation and dialogue, and with a premise that might have been copied from a Scientology pamphlet.On the plus side, the villainous Mogadorians and CGI monsters look passably cool, and it provided employment for Timothy Olyphant and some Australian actors. I hope they all manage to live it down, but it's sufficiently forgettable that they probably will.Having been persuaded to watch this by a teenage relative who has since apologized, we did our best to keep ourselves awake (insert Mogadorian/Mogadon joke here) by providing our own commentary, but what this really needs to make it entertaining is the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 crew."
1,The Powers of Matthew Star,"All this movie is, is a remake of the 1980's Tv Show ""The Powers of Matthew Star"" if you want to see a better version I would suggest going and pulling that old show out of the dust.Its really sad that they couldn't create an original movie and that they had to rip off an old tv show. But that is Disney for you, let's screw everything over for a profit."
4,"Paquita, the best",I have enjoyed the cd. She gives a good performance everytime. I like the ballads better if you had a more selective list
4,Good Movie!,I thought it was well done. The action scenes were good and the story line kept my interest. Hope they do a sequel.
3,Not bad to pass some time.,The premise of the story is kinda lame. Aliens hiding on earth from other aliens. Pretty good action though. All in all not a bad way to kill some time watching.
2,"Ugh, Twilight With Aliens","Not even Dianna Agron or Timothy Olyphant could save this. I'm not saying it was a complete waste of time, but I'm not not saying that. Let's see teenage guy that isn't quite human comes into the life of a very attractive young teenage girl. There is the secrets, the hiding, her finding out and not caring and then some individuals from his circles come into the picture and want to kill them. Big fight at the end, save the girl, etc... Plot sound familiar? If the aliens were vampires and Dianna Agron was a klutzy brunette we'd have Twilight...maybe with better acting though."
4,Better Than Expected Sci-fi,"Interesting story-line and an entertaining execution. It does follow some of the basics of sci-fi when humans interact with people from another world. So of course some of the script is very predictable, but this contains a couple of surprises. Overall a ""good"" not great movie. Worth a watch."
2,If you've over 17 this movie is not for you.,"Someone described this as a poor Twilight knock-off using an alien instead of a Vampire. They nailed it! If you've over 17 this movie is not for you. If you're looking for a lot of action and great special effects this movie is not for you. If you're looking for a great sci-fi story this movie is not for you.However, if you're under 17 and want to oogle some ""eye candy"" or whatever you call it nowadays, and could care less about a story line or even acting - then this movie is for you."
2,Don't waste your time,"This was such a terrible movie. It was like a straight to video high school film with great special effects. So So acting with teen cheesy lines. I'm glad I didn't purchase this movie, I rented it from Netflix. lacking in Special features as well, only the standard ""Deleted scenes and bloopers"" reel. You would think with Blu-Ray disc being able to fit 50GBs of data that most movies would have a behind the scenes documentary. I will say this, if you are going to get it be sure to get the Blu-Ray because there is a huge difference, The animation was amazing. I will give the movie that.I like this director D.J Curuso, he did Eagle Eye which was a great film. And Timothy Olyphant was good in this, not his best role but he stood out.In short: Waste of time, but if you really want to see it rent it."
1,"So Poorly Done, You're Left Puzzled!","Could not be more dumbed down or cliched. I don't understand why directors and writers make choices like this. The story had promise for sure but it's delivered like a Saturday morning, 'made for TV' drama - aimed at 10 year olds. Even the first five minutes of 'set up' by the narrator are painful to listen to and you get this 'oh no' feeling like someone has made some very bad choices in making this film."
5,I rate most movies by how much I enjoy them and this one I'd definitey see again if I had the time and money.,"I rate most movies by how much I enjoy them and this one I'd definitey see again if I had the time and money. It's a must buy for me on Blu Ray. The action and special effects were great and the story wasn't bad, it kept me engaged. Was it great? maybe not but I liked it all the same and look forward to the next one."
4,Good,"The movie was good, but not great. The movie also has is open ended. May they are hoping to make a sequel."
4,Excellent sci-fi movie!,I have watched this movie twice since getting it and each time I enjoy it more. I do hope they make or have made a second movie to go with it. Lot's of action and fun. The characters are likable and well played by the actors. I highly recommend this one!
4,I didn't know of this movie when it came out..,"I'm a movie buff and I for what ever reason missed this movie when it first came out, so when I ran into the reviews on Amazon, I thought sounds good to me; so I purchased the dvd, and liked it quite a bit. I liked it enough that I will most likely see the sequel at the theatre."
3,No closed captioning available.,"I'm kind of disappointed, I would give more stars if it has closed caption available, since I am hard of hearing."
3,I am Number 3 and I wasn't overwhelmed by the film.,The movie is action movie with some decent special affects and kind of strug together plot. Overall it was entertaining but definitely not one of my favorites. I liked the big dog the best. Don't waste a Friday night watching it.
4,Very Good!,I had never even heard of this movie but it was very good! I think I am going to purchase it because I would definitely watch it again.
3,Another good waste of time movie,Watched this on a plane ride. Okay movie that I would watch on a rainy weekend when this is on cable. Nothing special.
3,Just ok,"Meh... it was ok. I would not have paid to see this in the theater, but it was ok for a prime movie."
3,Different,"I watched this movie, it had a lot of twists and turns and kept you guessing. Not a movie for kids!"
3,Not bad,Got me yawning a few times and it was obvious it was going to be a sequel half way through. Not a bad movie to sit through if you have nothing better to do.
3,Enjoyable,This was a fun movie with a lot of action. I am not a huge sci-fi fan but this was an enjoyable movie for me. The pace is quick and you'll love the dog.
