4,An informative and readable book. Recommended.,"I was suprised with how ""friendly"" John Shaw comes across in this book. His writing is easy to understand yet comprehensive. He assumes you know nothing and teaches the rules of basic photography as well as Nature photography. The book is very well illustrated and gives specific recommendations on equipment. I was disappointed by the books binding though (perhaps I just got a bad one?) It began separating after only a few readings. I gave rating of 7 because of binding. My rating of the content is a solid 10"
5,Got My Whiskey,I love this song. The first time i heard it I had to have it. I went to all the stores in my town and surrounding areas and no one had this CD available. My sister knew how bad i wanted this CD and asked a friend to record it for me and i play it all the time. I had never heard of Mel Waiters but keep it coming Mel.K.J. In Fla.
3,great product....but,This is a great product for small torches that are used to sweat copper and thinfs like that....but i bought it to light my industrial torches a the rail car repair shop i work at and it just isnt strong enough to light our torches. Now i use it to light my grill and its perfect for that.I was a bit disappointed with it not being able to light our oxy/acetalyne and oxy/propane torches.I guess flint strikers are still the best
3,excellent sound,i owned this on the original cassette. it is great but whats with the high price. i liked it but i don't think its worth 130 bucks by a long shot. who ever wrote the other reviews must be sellers. its only like six or seven tracks . come down on that price and you'll find more buyers for a great sound
5,Electro Boogie Encounter,"If you are expecting the sort of floor pounding syncopation and heavy bass that an Afrika Bambaata record has, you're not going to find it here. This record treads a very interesting and original path that leads it from times to electric light orchestra sort of territory(Ground Control) and all the way through disco, house and hip hop. As such, this record presents a fantastic example of the sort of ingenuity and individuality that drove the birth of house, electro, and hiphop as we know them now. It really makes a lot of the music of the 1980s make a lot more sense to hear records like this, as its easy to hear this record's influence on decades worth of music. Needless to say, you probably hear the Johnson Brother's influence everyday- they produced everybody who was anybody for decades, from the Jonzun Crew to NSYNC."
5,Spectacular,"Ms. Trope wrote PDKTF with an intense honesty and a youthful sort of wisdom that is perhaps as valuable as that which comes with age. You will fall in love with her characters; they are very cleverly defined. Zoe's thoughts are vivid at being vague, and she is quite the epitome of a beautifully frustrated freshman girl, too smart to be caged by routine, and so gives way to apathy... a frustrating and well orchestrated circle. And she expresses it all very well in such a short book. I am quite a fan, and I look forward much to her latest endeavors, whatever they may be. *wink wink*"
5,Great stuff,This is a wonderful book--I wish I'd been this sharp and observant in high school. Highly recommended to fans of Lydia Davis and McSweeney's. You know who you are.
1,[Stuff],"I read this book and thought it was the most poorly crafted junk ever to grace a bookshelf. If there was ever a need for evidence of why fourteen-year-olds should not be writing books, well, here it is. That this book has gotten the attention that it has is notable because it illustrates how totally misguided our national obsession with youth culture, and especially teenage culture, is. Miss ""Trope"" needs to study her craft long and hard before she even considers bringing another work to the table."
1,STOP THIS NOT SYLVIO'S WORK ! READ MY REVIEW FIRST.,"This cd is an insult for Sylvio's fans. Let me explain, I collect Sylvio's work and as soon as I saw this cd without wasting time I bought it. On my way home I could not wait to listen this new cd, to my surprise it was not Sylvio, it was a group called (Synthesis) that if you look carefully at the cd, you will see in small letters this name. Sylvio is a special guest and his intervention in this cd is very minimal. This is a lack of respect to all Sylvio's fans, and to Sylvio. Do not buy this cd unless you listen to it first, because is not even close to Sylvio's style. I was lucky enough that the store in which I bought the cd returned my money. Once again this is a lack of respect and an insult to us (Sylvio's collectors). I advise amazon.com to retire this cd as a work of Syivio in respect to all your customers. We deserve to be well informed."
1,Stinks Like Dead Fish,"In case you weren't convinced by the other reviews previously posted, take my word for it--this CD just plain stinks. It sounds like it was recorded through a $3 Radio Shack microphone pointed at a pocket transistor radio. Supposedly Sintesis is one of the top bands in Cuba. Listening to this heinous CD I can't understand why. Had I not paid so much for it, this is the one CD in my collection I'm tempted to use as a drink coaster/frisbee/skeet target. And I'm a borderline insane Silvio Rodriguez fan. In the 80's I actually took a trip to South America mostly just to buy his albums that weren't available in the US. I'd recommend any Silvio CD over this one, even if it were a recording of him making barnyard sounds or performing childrens' songs by cupping his hand under his armpit."
5,In Concert...,"...once again, WOW! These Vocalion recreations are out of this world! I have the original vinyl recordings but cannot figure out how these geniuses can improve the originals. Better than attending the original concert! ...and that Ronnie Verrell. ...come to think of it, the whole band was of the absolute highest quality to ever come out of the UK.Ted would also have been proud with the professionalism of his organization, under the leadership of Don Lusher untill the final concert in 2000."
2,Poor quality dvds,"The program itself is a good tool for learning a foreign language. However, I ordered directly from the company (early advantage), and the quality of the actual dvds is horrid. I've had to call and request replacement dvds because the center of the each dvd is cracking and beginning to chip away. I wouldn't complain, except this is te THIRD time it has happened, and now the company claims it's 'most unusual' for this to happen. The first two representatives I spoke with (last year), admitted that the dvds were part of a batch that had problems with this cracking. However, the person today said that was not the case, and they need to physically inspect the dvds before they can replace them. Who knows how long that will take. Their customer service went from a 10 to a 1 (10 being great, 0, non-existent) in my book. Too bad, because the program is a great way to get my kids familiar with a foreign language."
3,"Nicely made, but......","I spent hours trying to get it to work with my system. I went online to remote central, AVS forum, etc. Finally, I gave up and ordered the Harmony 670. The URC is obviously well made, but I had the Harmony up and running inless than 40 minutes. The wife loves it, too. Case Closed!"
4,Good Buy!,"I purchased the URC300 on Amazon for $59.95 (limited time) which is a fantastic price for a 15 device universal remote control. Its construction is sturdy and well-designed, however programming is not as intuitive as it could be. It did take some time trying to coordinate the power and volume functions on my equipment to avoid jumping back an forth between the components. The manual does a fairly decent job walking you through this process. I have an OPPO DVD player that did not have a pre-programmed code in the remote so I had to use the ""learning method"" feature to program each button on the universal to work with this player. While the process wasn't difficult, it was tedious. Overall, this is a good solid remote that operates all of my equipment and for the price you can't beat it."
3,Universal Remote Review,"Good unit, easy to program. Could be easier to switch between components. Light should come one when you touch any button. It's ok, not great. I'm still getting familiar with it, may get better over time."
4,Works fine,"I'm still playing with it, but so far it works great. And I have found it fairly easy to program, once I watched the enclosed DVD. Very simple."
2,NOT SO EASY TO USE,"I WAS HOPING FOR A UNIVERSAL REMOTE THAT WAS EASY TO USE, I ALSO CONTACTED THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND I AM STILL WAITING FOR A RESPONSE.E. FIELD"
2,Not good military history,I was looking for a one volume history of the desert war. Ended up picking War Without Hate. Bad choice- this is not a very good military history. Two examples of this. First the book devotes more pages to the true story behind the movie The English Patient than it does to Operation Battleax. Battleax gets 2 or 3 lines- the English Patient gets about 5 pages. Second there is very little discussion of logistics- the key determining factor in the theater.Those are just two examples. The book comes across as more lightweight pop-history than a serious study of the campaign.
5,Read all the rest? Now read the ....,"Well, maybe not THE BEST but a damn fine read. I've been reading about the Desert War since 1962 when i bought Donald Crisp's classic ""Brazen Chariots"" so if i like this book its worth reading. Even the maps are OK, better certainly than most ""real"" histories. The chosen anecdotes and award citations all move the action in a comphrensible account. They even have the possible origin of the Monty Python Classic: ""I'm not dead yet!""--""Turner had been touring his perimeter, helping a short-handed gun crew or tending the wounded when he could, exhorting when he could not. Bird sometimes wished he could find a happier choice of words. 'Come on, you're not dead yet,' he growled at the shaken occupants of a slit-trench who had been almost buried alive by a near-miss."" pp. 304-305.And the title seems to come from Rommel's prospective but never written book on the war: War without Hate.pete saussy"
5,Excellent Book on the British Side in North Africa,"Ive always been interested in the Africa War of World War II and this was a great book on ihe German Side and the British side of the war, from Rommels and Monty's HQs all the way down to the squad level where the the action is. It starts out with the British just beating the heck out of the Italians, and then Rommel coming and being the greatest Genearl ever. But it shows how Monty made great decisions to lead to the British victory and the German evacutation. If you like World War II books, this is one for u."
2,This Is What Gives Grits A Bad Rap...,"I was hoping I found a source for ""real"" grits. I was tipped off that this wasn't the real deal when the label said something about ""mush"". It fits the definition of mush i.e. soft or soggy mass.I have been searching for real grits since my supplier retired. He refurbished an old grist mill as a hobby then decided to use the plentiful local corn to mill grits. They were fabulous, the real kind that you had to add water, let the hulls float to the top, pour off the water, add more water, then cook for 45 minutes. Lots of butter, salt, and pepper and there's nothing better."
3,College Stats,"I used this book for a college course I took. While some of the explanations are clear, other stats books my friends have explained the concepts in a way that was easier to understand."
5,"Basic Statistical Analysis, Math in Plain English","At last a math text written in plain English! Unlike other text books that I used, this book does not skip the intermediate steps leaving the reader confused. Makes analysis of variance look simple. I recommend this for social science and education majors."
4,Basis Statistical Analysis,"Easy to read but is not a book for non math students. If you don't desire to have a good foundation behind the mathematics and just want formulas with examples, this book is for you."
1,More Information is need about used books,"To whom it may concern,I have purchased many, many text books from Amazon, all new and all quality, except for one. I purchased the book ""Statistical Analysis"" used from Amazon, not a third party seller, and the book was FILLED with high-lighter. I understand that the book was at a reduced price, but the book-condition did not mention any damage to the book, and high-lighter is damage. Unfortunately, I will be reselling this book back to Amazon with the same ""book-condition"" rating, and another unsuspecting customer will be stuck with this junk.Good Luck!"
5,Definitive Book on Color,"I conduct research using color as a variable and have had a very difficult time finding accurate sources of information. This book is not only the most accurate book I've seen on color, it is the ONLY accurate book I've seen. It takes you through the basics of defining color as well as the science behind color."
5,The best of its kind,"Knitting counterpanes is a deceptive title; Ms. Phillips has made it possible to learn stitches and patterns that look difficult, but are simple with her charting system. No one needs to knit entire coverlets; the project size is up to the reader. The pattern diversity, with the accompanying historical text (which is fascinating in and of itself), makes for a lot of pleasurable reading/planning. I recommend this book for any knitter who wants to knit new patterns that are stunning."
5,OW! ERNESTINE & CO. CLASSIC JAZZ & BLUES~BRAVO!!!,"Ernestine Anderson is still riding high as the greatest living legendary Jazz Diva in the classic vein of Ella, Sarah, and Carmen and in this live set taken from a Concord Jazz Festival in Japan at her absolute peak!!! Following at the finale after masterful performances from legends, this is a sublime set that is a must for any true jazz fan! Ernestine wraps her warm and soulful voice around ""I Love Being Here With You"" and infuses this standard with so much meaning with great rhythm and timing that this will spin around in your head long after its over...""All Blues"" is simply the greatest ever vocal version of this classic and the down and dirty ""Down Home Blues"" is a funky jam!! Grab this one as it is sure to become a rare collectors classic as this kind of greatness sadly may not happen again!! Bravo to Ernestine and all the greats here...a real musical treat."
1,This book is Outdated,This book is old and talks about solving calcium problems that have been solved many years ago. I advise looking for something else more recent if you want to care for your Chameleon
3,This is not the Sarah of today,"he growth of Sarah Brightman as a singer and performer is never more evident than watching this older concert. There are VERY few pop/classical edge songs. This CD contains many tracks from her ""Time to Say Goodbye"" CD. Also, ""Balerio"" is the original version, not the one remade by Peterson from Eden. If you are into her newer stuff, I wouldn't buy this one,however, if you like her voice, and you REALLY like classical pieces, you will certainly enjoy. She also does the normal Phantom pieces as she still peforms today in her concerts."
3,Early Sarah,"We are fans of Sarah Brightman, but this is an early video and it does not show her imagination and performing ability as the later videos do. It starts out rather slow with her singing with the orchestra a variety of opera style songs and then graduates to her Phantom of the Opera songs which everyone seems to love. She has too short of a performance with Andrea Bocelli-together they are great."
5,A wonderful video!,Sarah Brightman has such a beautiful and divine voice. I highly recommend this concert video. Sarah sings many beautiful songs on it. I'd give it ten stars if I could!
3,not bad,"pretty good when compared to other opera singers... but does not compare to the ""eden"" or ""la luna"" DVDs... not by a long shot... still good, though..."
3,could be better,"this performance is excellent, however, Sarah's diction is very sloppy, every operatic song has a Ooo sound due to odd vowel shaping. it is a fantastic show, but it could have been better if she annunciated."
4,lots of fun but bizarre lip synching at work!,"This video contains a song ""Tu quieres volver"" that is beautiful, but matches, second-by-second, the track by the same title on Sarah's ""Time to say goodbye"" album. That album was recorded up through March 1997 with the LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. This video was recorded in September 1997 with the ENGLISH NATIONAL ORCHESTRA!... She has to be lip-synching in the video; there is no way the two tracks would perfectly match. But, the whole London symphony orchestra must also be ""pretending"" to play.How does lovely and entertaining Sarah get away with this?"
3,Slightly Chipped,"Having first read Used and Rare I was disappointed in the quality of this work. This collection of essays is too disjointed, never really focusing on anything for long enough or maintaining a single theme. While the stories themselves are entertaining it just isn't on par with the rest of the Goldstones work. Having later read Out of the Flames I must say that the Goldstones need to stick to one topic per book and not to try another collection of essays without a common thread between them."
3,Used and Rare is superior,"The Goldstone's ""Used and Rare"" is a gem of a book-collecting tome, and one that I recommend over ""Slightly Chipped"". Those who devoured U&R will be disappointed by the leadenness of their followup title, particularly as their former spark and enthusiasm for modern firsts isn't as evident in SC. Rather, they detail the truly uninteresting such as unexpected (to only them) Manhattan hotel's valet charges... Also, large portions of ""Slightly Chipped"" are devoted to quotations, a tactic that feels like mere filler in a volume this slim. Anyone captivated by ""Used and Rare"" will no doubt wish to pick up SC, but I'd suggest you wait until it appears in paper -- this is one hardback modern first that won't be increasing in value."
3,slightly lacking,"I loved the Goldstone's first book ""Used and Rare"" but found this lacking in content. They write like they are teaching an audience who know nothing about books, but a non bookish person would not have picked this book up. The digressions are irritating. My critisism of both books is that they use silly spelling to define a different or comical accent. I am English and assume all Americans to have accents, even the Goldstones."
2,Somewhat Disappointed in 'Slightly Chipped',"This book was a disappointment. I expected to read more about interesting bookstores, their owners, and quests for elusive books. Instead, the Goldstones digressed. Only a handfull of bookstores were explored. Large parts of the book were occupied by the Bloomsbury crowd, the Edgar awards, the Cudjo story, and the Sotheby auction at which the Goldstones bought no books. I will carefully read reviews of future Goldstone books in this series before purchasing."
2,very disappointing,"After reading, and enjoying, the Goldstone's first book, I eagerly purchased their second volume believing that it would mirror the enthusiasm and spirit of discovery captured in their first effort. It didn't. Slightly Chipped is pretentious, and painful to read. Do not buy this book (even in paperback) and don't even bother to check it out of the library."
5,A serious look at Jazz Guitar,"""Keeping that jazz guitar flame alive"" was used to describe Bruce Formans quality of musicianship and is apropo! Bruce Forman is a GIANT of that Genre, too bad he hasn't achieved more commercial success, he deserves it. I have listened to Mr. Forman for many years, as far back as his ""In Transit"" days and have always admired his work.Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, Herb Ellis, Tal, Bernie Kessel and many, many more are in good company with Bruce FormanThis release is one you'll surely enjoy, if straight ahead Jazz Guitar a genre you enjoy. Great arrangments abound on all of Bruce's work and this one is no exception. Thanks Bruce, listening always remains a pleasure, time and time again."
4,Monk is da Funk,"Cute little show about compulsive clean freak, a few laughsand a mini-mystery wrapped in 45 minutes. Can you piece together the clues? Relaxing before bedtime. Spanish subtitlesappreciated."
2,Problem with DVD ...,"The DVD was of poor quality. It skipped and ""pixelated"" on my DVD player. I returned it to the vendor and am waiting to receive a new DVD or refund."
1,a disc was bogus...unfortunately...,"man, i love the series but one of the discs was disfunctional...had to return it to whoever and get amazon credit...hope next time is better...cheers!"
5,Gotta love Monk!,"Instead of renting movies off of Netflix, my husband and I buy a season of an older series every month. We have really enjoyed Monk."
5,Monk,"This was a gift for my husband. What can I say? If you like the series Monk than I'm sure you'll want to own this. Dvd came on time and shipping, packaging was good."
5,I just love Monk!,The early days were just so unique and entertaining. I have 1st 3 seasons now and have ordered the 4th. I love this series!
5,Present,"Bought it as a gift along with several other seasons, the person we bought it for absolutely loves them. Arrived in original packaging."
2,monk review,my whole family loved being able to watch a season of monk without all the commercials. And it really is a great show
5,Monk Shines,"Although the first three or four episodes of this season are a little ""flat"" compared with previous and subsequent episodes, the set is well worth getting if you are a fan of the obsessive-compulsive detective Adrian Monk."
5,Monk-Season two,"The same as season one. Can't get enough of Monk. Being a Monk fan; even if you kind of know what is going to happen at the end, getting there is all the fun. Everyone I know have some OCD tendencies in them, so I can see somebody I know in Monk...it's funny to name these people when he sees him do certain things. Hilarious. This is such a keeper!!"
4,Monk Season 2,"Both my wife and I are great fans of Monk since the first show. We had season 1, and wanted both 2 and 3, which I purchased at the same time as a surprize for my wife. We watch them over and over when we cannot find anything on TV or at the movies - which is quite often.My only problem is that our unit and TV do not play some of the special features - this may be my fault with the machine's settings, hence the drop of one of the rating stars."
5,great purchase,"this was a great purchase. all of his episodea are good, but it seems that season two is especially good. the price was very good and the dvds are in great condition."
5,Monk rocks!,"I enjoy Monk whenever I catch it on cable though I don't watch it too often. Yesterday I decided to rent one episode and I did a quick search for which episodes are considered the best of all time. According to quite a few websites this one is one of the best so I rented it and really had a good time watching this quaky show! Like all Monk's this one is zany, quirky and just plain keeps you entertained and guessing."
5,WHY DID WE HAVE TO WAIT 17 YEARS FOR THIS???,"Thank G-d this DVD finally appeared. The CD has been long available. This is a unique interpretation of the Paganini caprices. Lots of very imaginative ideas, lots of liberties, a most exciting and stimulating performance. What the heck if it is controversial and not always in tune? Who cares? This is music-making of the highest order, taking a lot of courage too. I salute and admire Mr Markov. The DVD will remain one of my all-time favorites."
2,Not good on curly hair,"Perhaps the ceramic plates make it less effective on curly hair, but coming from an extremely experienced hair styler (non-professional) using a professional blow dryer, this brush could not effectively blow out my hair. I had to go back to my metal plated brush. I am NOT a fan of CHI products after trying them. I usually use high end (professional grade) hair styling products. The flat iron left a lot to be desired and the products all have parabens in them and are not worth the money for the results. I'll stick with Lanza leave-in products, my regular big round brush and a my Elchim hair dryer."
2,Highway killer,"when people begins to get killed on the highway, the inhabitants of orangeville felt unsecured anylonger, but the last person the cops will suspect will be a female killer and a female killer who tricks men with an ice-pick of a tool could be more deadlier than the rattlesnake. so the cops finds it difficult to track a murder who kills both ob highways and in beach cabins. she is deadlier than posion. chase again stages the scene for a real thriller bunch of cakes for his lovers."
2,Not eco-friendly,"I am sorry now that I purchased this item. Don't misunderstand me - it looks great and appears to be made of quality metal. However, for the reasons I purchased it, it isn't what I want. I bought this 3-light lamp so that my husband and I can both read simultaneously, each with our own light. My first complaint is that there is only one switch that turns on all three lights at the same time. Turning the knob a second time makes them brighter. So you are using all three lights when only one or 2 are necessary. In addition it uses 60 watt incandescent bulbs - we are a compact flourescent household. Because of the way the switch works, you really should not use CFL's. As soon as I find another 3-lamp light that I like at all, this one will be GONE!"
1,slanted and rumored,"Amnesty inspired. Full of baseless rumors that cannot be documented. Very anti Han, and racist."
4,A broad overview,"Very general overview for the subject of dynamic systems modeling, providing ample historical perspectives. Not suitable for folks looking for deep technical matters."
3,Highly Recommended!,"George Eckes' experience in quality control includes an instance where he had the temerity, just out of college, to ask W. Edwards Deming, then an octogenarian, to elaborate on his views about quality. ""Those are the most stupid questions I have ever heard! Go read some of my books,"" the cantankerous quality czar responded. No one reading this volume can doubt that Eckes has done his homework ever since. His blend of experience, theoretical expertise and common sense make this a very effective Six Sigma manual, although it is a little light on case studies. One of the book's most valuable elements is Eckes' keen analysis of the pitfalls that can flush all your best Six Sigma intentions down the tubes, even as a row of consultants tell you it is a panacea for all your woes. We recommend this book to anyone who is about to call a consultant and venture into the Rasputin world of Six Sigma."
3,Outrageous? Hardly,"Mr. Wooten has a quirky and enjoyable sense of humor. Initially, this quality holds the reader's attention. But inevitably, the humor wears offwhen it is apparent that it cannot take the place of a good, unpredictableplot. Consequently, this reader soon lost interest in the progress of theaction, which seemed to repeat itself incessantly."
5,A story for singles of any team!,"You don't have to be single, male or gay to appreciate the hilarity and hazards of the dating world! I was pleasantly surprised at the number of times I laughed out loud when I read this book! I may not have had the same experiences, but everyone has or knows a ""date from hell"" story. All of this is set against a believable backdrop of building a life and career at the same time. Arthur has a keen wit and great pacing. I also enjoyed Fruit Cocktail just as much (sequels are almost always a disappointment - not in this case!!)"
2,On Picking Fruit,"While often funny, the book seemed to have an underlying theme of negative gay stereotypes--many of the characteris were loose canons, and I grew tired of the silly thoughtless behavior of the major character, who was so deetermined to meet the ""right"" persion that he would do almost anything. I lost patience and would have stopped reading the book if I wasn't reading it as part of a book club discussion group.. ."
2,Not what I thought,This book was not at all what I thought it would be. The whole study was done in the UK which is widely different than the US. I honestly could not even finish the book. I was expecting a book that went into the reason why women choose to be child-free more than what they went through to be sterilized. I was not happy at all.
4,Content Good; Delivery Way Too Fast!,"Dr. Viscott gives sound, useful advice. However, because of Viscott's overly fast rate of speech, one will miss much of what of the excellent advice he has to give unless the tapes are played over and over again."
1,The authors have taken the reader into the darkness.,"As a sufferer of Chronic Immune Dysfunction Syndrome i.e., Chronic Fatigue, I was apalled by the author(s) slant on this disease. While I believe that the course of every disease has some dependence on one's mental well-being, CIDS is very much a physical manifestation of a very debilitaing chronic disease."
1,These guys don't have a clue!!!,"Despite piles of new groundbreaking research on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, these guys have decided that it's all a psychological disorder or just plain malingering. Their history of flawed and leading research is digusting and unprofessional and is laughed at my the educated researchers and health professionals who treat this serious disease. The medical community has been quick to label new diseases as purely psychological in the past including polio, multiple sclerosis and even AIDS. If you want to read about the ""dark ages"" view of CFS/ME, then read this book."
4,"The Story of A Mosque: Cultural Laboratory, Religious Marvel","This is a book tells the story of a poorly understood community and its dynamic culture and progressive leadership in Long Island and across America. It is an inspiring and insightful book, a window into a religion and a house of worship that is often sadly misunderstood by Americans. The book succesfully breaks down misconpetions about Islam and facilitates an easy understanding of Muslims in America and around the world. Personally, as a non-Muslim, the reading of The Story of a Mosque propelled my undestading of Islam to a deeper and more thorough level of understanding and appreciation.Roshni Abayasekara, Class of 2001, Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, Freelance writer Newsday"
4,Very surprised!,I was quite surprised by the quality of the production. There is a lot to catch here if you pay attention. One of the better TRUE indie shorts I've seen.
3,Logic is silly,"So, if I am reading this correctly. I can buy the movie for 99 cents. And own it forever.Or, I can rent the movie for 7 days. For $1.99...Seems to make sense to me."
2,Cover of Book looks Used and Almost Torn,"Disappointed in merchandiseThe cover of the book was in wrinkled and used condition.If it weren't a Christmas gift & due this week, I'd return it."
5,Enjoyable from the first page to the last.,"Boiano's Edge was a wonderful experience from the opening page. Brian shares many different aspects of skating with us all. Basically it was meant for a younger group but he included so many interesting facts about the skating world from choreography to skating terms, great photos etc. It was a very user friendly book for those not greatly familiar with the skating world. I have bought three of them and Brian has autographed each one. In person he is an extremely humble and kind person. I think his book reflects these qualities."
1,"Banal, and eleven years too late","Boitano's glory days were the 1988 Olympics, when he beat the favored Brian Orser in Calgary. The time for Boitano to write a book was then, not now. As it is, his career has long been eclipsed by new skating stars. His ""insights"" into the sport to which he has devoted his life are banal and offer nothing new to any skating fan. This book seems like a feeble attempt to bolster his waning career, and nothing more."
1,a book with an identity crisis,"This book is a disappointment. It is hard to tell what it was intended to be.Was it supposed to be a look at the world of figure skating? If so, there is far too much of a focus on Brian Boitano's life and career. (Even the other champions who are quoted in the book are only talking about Boitano!) The only interesting tidbit about the skating world, if this was the goal, is the news that a past competition was fixed so Boitano's team could win.Was it supposed to be abook about Brian Boitano? If so, there's not enough information about his life or his career, and the information about other skaters and the technical aspects of skating are just padding. His relucatance to really write book about himself may reveal more than any book would have."
5,A beautiful gift,"I received this book as a gift, and I cannot tell you how pleasant I found it. The photographs are lovely. The text is charming and delightful. This is the perfect edition to my library, and it's a book that's perfect for all ages to read. Brian Boitano should be very proud of this book."
2,Not What I Ordered,It wasnt what I ordered Then my kids tried one and it was a chocolate no puffs inside. This isnt what I thought it would be
3,Excellent Text Horrible Book,"This is a very nice text, an unconventional treatment to the subject that makes it very useful.But the book binding is horrible. Pages started flying out within 2-3 weeks of use. Seems like they have just dipped one end of the pagestack in glue. For one of the costliest book, $130, on my stack, a better binding is expected."
3,A nice introduction to the band,An ok introduction to the band for the neophyte for them to learn of the sound and the phenomenon of the group...remember the time that the songs came out to put in place.
3,Decent,"The shoes looked exactly as they appeared on Amazon; however, I wear a size 11 and I ordered a size 11, but the shoes are very big on me. They feel like they are a size and a half too big."
2,Product toured the West Coast for two weeks before it was delivered,"This was a Christmas gift. As far as I know, the quality is what we expected. The only problem was that it ""toured"" the West Coast for about two weeks before I received it. Thank goodness I ordered several weeks before Christmas!"
5,"Honest, emotional memoir","I was amazed by the frank insights into herself this author shared on every page of this great read. Following the story of how she explores her past while finding her future, I was amazed at the total lack of rationalization so many memoirs seem to be built on; Soderlind tells a completely honest story that captures both the terror and possibilities of life in your early twenties. Beautifully written, well paced, and a book that I will keep thinking about for a long time."
5,A MODERN LOOK BACK AT BRUBECK'S FIRST FAME!!!,This album is a wonderful mix of Brubeck's early works modernanized with Brubeck's new quartet with Randy Jones and some other dudes.(i just like the classic quartet)
3,DOES not work with FLY Fusion: FYI !!!,"People,Be careful, this notebook does NOT work with FLY Fusion: FYI !Otherwise, great product."
4,Gary Moore,Great Chicago style blues. Simple but powerful. Much closer to the original American blues roots than a lot of the English blues. (Although I love that too.)
2,"Fluff piece, lots of errors","As curator of one of the submarines mentioned in this paperback I was disturbed at the glaring number of errors contained in the text, both for my boat and others I am familiar with. The author did not give us an opportunity to vet the text prior to publication. It would not make my list of the top 50 sub books. It does provides a bit of insight into the diversity of service these proud vessels provided our Nation over 50 years of service and careers that continue today as memorial ships."
5,Guidebook for museum tours,I liked this book and wish I had it along when I toured 3 WWII museum boats. The history that goes along with each boat featured is brief but informative. It provides good directions to the museum boats and gives a brief history on how they got to their 'final port'. Now I have a list of future boats to visit. I recommend visiting one of these boats to everyone especially young people.
2,Bad Editing ...........,"Upon opening the book, I read a glaring error on the opening page. Although there was a Les Brown who served on the USS Charr, her hull number is SS-328 NOT 321.USS Besugo SS-321 served until 1966 when she was transferred to Italy, and renamed Francesco Morosini.Generally the book is a good read and although I was soured at the beginning it ended up OK.Ray Samson EN3(SS)USS Charr SS-3281955 - 1958"
5,Pinstripes and Pearls -- a success story,"I loved this book!! What an inspiration! I was so interested in knowing what motivated these women to go to Harvard back in the 60's. I found it also interesting that all of the women in the book had the support of their fathers. How wonderful! Their determination to succeed should give hope to every woman today. The descriptions of the women's experiences at the Harvard Law school is at times moving and humorous. Their lives from an early age to their lives' today was exciting to read. And to get a glimpse of Harvard through the eyes of the author and others at Harvard in those days who have risen to such fame and prominence in our society today was fascinating. I think Judith Hope did a great job writing this book, and I particularly enjoyed reading about her life -- wow!! What an exciting life!"
1,Looking for comedy...,"this film should have been called, Looking for Comedy.I wasnt familiar with Brooks' work before watching this, and now that I have seen this film I think I will be avoiding this 'comic'.The film lacks humor on every level, and tries to set up jokes that fizzle and fail relentlessly.The story is starts off on an interesting premise, find out what makes Muslims laugh. It then goes off on tangents, tells us nothing about the Muslim sense of humor, nor what makes them (or us) laugh. The standup show scene in the New Delhi hall was beyond awful and magnifies Brooks' lack of comedic talent. I remember thinking that these people arent laughing not because they're Muslim, or Hindu, but because the comic is atrocious.Other plot structures go nowhere, the assistant's jealous boyfriend for instance. This film could have had so much potential with the right script and right talent, unfortunately with Brooks' annoying tone and flat attempts at comedy, it goes nowhere."
1,Looking for comedy...in this movie. Can't find it.,"Actually, what this movies shows very well is that what isn't funny in one country isn't funny elsewhere either. Period. People all over the world know how to laugh, don't get me wrong. It's just that THIS MOVIE is about as un-funny and it's own lame ghandi jokes.Albert Brooks, you're no Woody Allen, sorry. NEXT!"
1,Comedy at its worse,"I wish I could grab him by the neck and pull the mony I wasted on going to this out of his wallet, there should be a law to get your mony back when movies are this bad, there is no comedy in this movie he seems lost in trying to make something out of this movie, and he is annoyingly boring,"
2,this film will be available on dvd on may 2nd,looking for humor is what it is but ive been waiting for a albert brooks film it didnt get to
3,poorly done movie,"Was expecting much more out of this movie. The idea was great, but very poorly developed. Very often comideans are not the best actors. And this one deared even to direct a movie. So I would say it was a double fallier. With this title and idea there were so much potential."
4,Finding Comedy In the Muslim World,"One should be an Albert Brooks fan to know and have expirenced his dead pan humor. But like American's who watch this movie, they probably will take away just as much as the people in India, watching his stand up routine. Who would have thought that he would be so busy with his state department mission to actually miss seeing the Taj Mahal, even when he walks right in front of it. Like Woody Allen, its comedy that grows over a series of movies. Watching Albert Brooks on the early versions of Saturday night Live, he often had short films which for most, clearly went over the audience's heads."
5,I loved this movie!,Albert Brooks was terrific in this very funny and timely movie. As usual his timing is perfect; the sight gags were great and the one liners kept coming. We laughed alot! A must see movie.
1,Boring; I'm still looking for the comedy!,"This movie was not funny at all. It was slow and plodding, and we were waiting the entire movie for some comedy. We were sorely disappointed. I'm not saying it was not funny because it contained some un-PC jokes; it didn't. I'm saying it was not funny beacuse it simply had no jokes or humor in it at all. And for all the ""dry humor"" I heard critics speaking of, I found none. It simply did not work, and we only continued watching because we had already wasted so much time on it, and thought it could only improve - we were mistaken.The movie is also very much mis-titled. It should be ""Looking for Comedy in India"". Yes, they make some half-hearted explanation that India has some several million Muslims, but that still does not make it ""the Muslim world"". Or they should have named it ""How to bore the Muslim World into Submission""."
1,Sitting through this was a complete waste of time.,"I was hoping to find some humor in the movie . . in the Muslim world, in India, anywhere, but there was none. Not even cutesy scenes or double entendres. No jokes, no lighthearted tales, nothing. This must be one of the most humorless, stupid movies I ever saw. I kept waiting for something to happen because I thought that the movie couldn't be THAT bad, but it was.My reaction was embarrassment more than anything else. I felt embarrassed just watching the thing, and I will try to avoid anything else that Albert Brooks appears in . . how could he have the wherewithal to participate in this junk. Sitting through this was a complete waste of time."
1,Disgraceful.,"I was absolutely shocked to see that this product is listed at more than double the normal cost, due to, according to the seller, 'premium pricing due to scarcity'.This product is hardly scarce. It is stocked in every MAC store I've ever been in, and I just bought several tubes of it over the holiday for $14. Spend an extra minute to find this product elsewhere online, and don't fall for this shameless con."
1,not scarce,"""premium price due to scarcity"" ?????This color is still in production by MAC, has not been discontinued and can easily be bought from MAC, the MACcosmetics internet site or dept. stores with a MAC counter for the regular $14 price.In fact this is one of their classic colors from the 90's and I doubt they would ever discontinue it."
5,Something else to love about Film Noir.,"This lipstick glides on like a dream, softens the lips and has pretty good staying power. The color turns to that great, deep, dark, bad girl red that I absolutely adore. You can't wear this without wanting to sip a Martini. My lips are irresistible.Buy it, just not from this website.MMMMWAAH!"
4,"I thought it was really good, the 4th song is the best","I thought that this Cd sounded excellent, i especially liked the 4th song on the CD. Like someone else said it really has kind of a,neil young, feel to it. Which im not usually really attracted to but i thought that this CD sounded very good. I know im gonna go pick it up! and you should too"
2,Faulty,"This cartridge makes my HP print out a test page every time I turn on the printer. Tried my other spare cartridges and verified its not a problem with the printer. What can I say, it's a garbage cartridge.Print quality is fine."
2,Garbage,"Cmon folks, I've used two of these now, and they run out after 6-12 pages, which is obviously ridiculous. Currently this cartridge is just printing faded lines along with some normal black saturation. I've gone through four of these in the last few months and I hardly print much at all on a weekly/monthly basis.The quality is very poor in addition to that - and I only print black text for college.Back to the outrageously priced HP name brand ink. It will be nice when one day we never have to use printer's ink again."
1,worst crap ever,"worst crap ever. These inks suck. I have been getting results with epson ink and replacement/refill inks from a company whos' product has been discontinued that are as good or better than any professional printer on earth. LD products wasted my time, materials and to add insult to injury, made me pay for return postage which defeated the purpose of buying inexpensive replacement cartridges. I will never do business with this company again. There is no excuse for selling an inferior product and robbing the public."
5,A Must-Read for a New Kind of Competitive Advantage,"I found this book compelling and actionable. The stories - which are drawn from a wide range of examples and not just the usual suspects that seem to appear in every book these days - were on target, covered a variety of industries, and were fun to read. I especially liked the frameworks for taking a look at the business and figuring out what to do next. These frameworks move beyond understanding customers to understanding customer experience - an important new dimension. The authors clearly know both the practical and the academic dimensions of the topic, and the bibliography is helpful in pointing to other places to look for deeper dives into the material. This is one of those rare books you can enjoy and learn from at the same time."
4,"Interesting, and pretty good","If you are interested in hard-to-find mixes, these discs are probably the best source for them. In particular, Purple Haze is presented in its original 45 rpm mono mix (and it beats the pathetic stereo version hands down). A similar treatment for Foxy Lady would have been nice. Unfortunately, that single is stereo. The sound quality is the same as on otherwise available cds. There are some interesting mixes, though, if that's what you are looking for. Overall, I recommend it."
1,A huge rip off,These songs are mostly available on most Hendrix compilations.Save your money on this one.
2,Weakest release,"Comparing this to ""....And So the night Became"" and ""Burning Shroud""; I can say this is one of Aeternus' weakest releases."
3,Aww the 80's,"Louder is the song on this album that is best known to me. I like the album, but not the price they want. If look are or know someone that is good at searching the internet you can find it to down load for way cheaper than buying the CD or album."
2,Aimless,"My primary interest in music on the electronic and/or experimental side, and Stockhausen is obviously a major player in each of those areas. It was with great excitement then that I ordered this disc. If a bit pretentious, its story filled my mind with all kinds of horrendous sounds and noises. Four string players in four helicopters, imagine what that must sound like! However, this disc is best left to the imagination.... the result is not half as furious, or remotely as interesting, as it could have, or should have, been. Between the repertoire of Stockhausen and the reputation of the Arditti String Quartet, I expected more than a pale tremolo for 30 minutes alongside a faint sputtering of rotors. Completely lacking any of the intrigue of its own story, and coming off with a yawn rather than a wow, this is a recording best left of the shelf in lieu of more relevant and impactful compositions such as ""Kontakte."""
4,Nice Speakers that do their job,"I did a lot of looking at reviews and spec's on a lot of speakers to replace my Altec Lansing floor speakers which have incredible sound, but all that blast power isn't needed anymore and I wanted something to go more with the HDTV rather than the CD's. These Yamaha's fit the bill. Good looking, small satellite stands fit the bill. Good timbre sound for voices and enough midrange to do the trick. Along with my subwoofer (should have with these) and small rear spkrs, why I am all set. Oh yeah, they look good w/the TV also. If you want better, if you have real high sound sense ( which 99.5 don't have), spend a couple grand each not $200 bucks. These are a good value."
2,Simply not a professional Speakers,"Very dissapointed with the sound.I am a huge fan of Yamaha.I had two home theater receiver with 6 speakers.(SPS-9500P)I am up grading into 7 channel and for the firs time, I am matching with Onkyo home theater receiver with Yamaha center speaker (bought new to boost the diologue) and the two front.This two front is dissapointing. I went back to my previous Yamaha speaker, SPS-9500P, which is 6 speaker set.It's rediculous since the 6 speaker system is around 260$ and this two speaker is almost 180$.Now the two speaker that I bought is only for decoration purpose since it's very cute and classic.Don't buy it !"
3,Greenwood is a solid textbook for senior/first year graduate,"Greenwood's Principles of Dynamics is a classic text used in mechanical and aeronautical engineering programs at universities all over the world. It provides clear descriptions and gives good examples of essential dynamics concepts. Overall, the book serves as both an excellent teaching text and professional reference. Weaker portions of the text include the motivation of and discussions on generalized coordinates, forces, and virtual work. Of the dynamics books available at the Senior/Master's level, this book ranks near the top. For deeper insight into dynamics and a more methodical approach to modeling and understanding the behavior of dynamic systems, look into some of Thomas Kane's publications. The complement of Kane's books and Greenwood give a direct and clear set of references that can be used in analyzing many dynamic systems."
2,Lacks pertinent examples and takes a cookbook approach,"This text is targeted for a senior level undergraduate or first year graduate course in mechanics. I was unimpressed with the lack of detailed examples and the ""cookbook"" approach to teaching the principles of mechanics. Rather than teach the underlying paradigm for deriving and general analysis techniques, this book still takes the approach of many first year undergraduate texts and gives the readers formula's to memorize. It offered little insight regarding how to approach solving a typical problem in mechanics. The examples were somewhat contrived as were the homework problems. Few if any had any obvious relation to real world engineering problems. The few examples given were of little help in understanding how to solve the homework problems and I found my self referring to other text books to understand the principles being taught. It also does not address the use of Euler Parameters instead of Euler Angles in coordinate transformations."
1,this book is terrible,The format and flow of the book is out-dated. Very hard to follow--because of the book...not the material.
1,Poorly made.,First of all it is cruel to keep a hamster in a cage this small. Also the cage is very difficult to keep together and constantly falls apart when touched. Hamster escaped cage several times due to cheap construction. I ended up buying a large fish tank and my little critter is so much happier. I do not reccomend this cage!
1,Super Pet CritterTrail One,"This is the cheapest, most flimsy, most user unfriendly creature habitat! Purchase something else! The plastic pieces started breaking as we put it together. Now the bottom plastic base and the top plastic roof are cracked. The plastic seems very hard and brittle. The hamsters seem happy enough in their bedding but the wheel is too big for a dwarf hamster."
3,not durable,My daughter held two gerbils in this cage. They chewed through the top lid and actually made a 1 inch hole in it. we have to recover this hole with tape everyday and but a rock on top so that it will stay shut. The plastic is much to rigid or something as most of the plastic clips have either broke or the plastic cracked in various places while cleaning the cage. I have years of experience with all sorts of animals that require all sorts of cages and I have never had a cage so badly made before.
1,WAY too small for ANY pet,"This cage is way too small for any sort of pet, and I feel that SuperPet should stop selling it. There are many better cages out there, including using a large Sterlite bin that you can purchase at Wal-Mart, Target, etc. This is much cheaper and provides ample room for your pet."
4,crittertrail one,"though it's not the easiest cage to assemble, my mice love it, and you can buy add ons [as i have] to make it even more fun for them. and there certainly have been no problems with mice getting stuck in the tubes, as they pass each other in them all the time. my only complaint is that it takes a while to assemble/disassemble, but for the price, it's not bad at all. the wheel can be a little loud if there's unsteady running, but you get used to it. if you want easier cleaning i'd probably recommend a glass cage with a screen top, but this cage is colorful and fun for the mice, so i think it's a trade off."
2,Kinda Sucks,I bought this a few weeks ago and i had to replace the water bottle because it was leaking annd i had to buy a new wheel because the racket it made drove me crazy! It kind of small but luckily you can add attachments! So all in all its ok but i wouldnt recommend it very highly.
3,Great but.......,This is a great cage for dwarf hamsters. We have two in the cage. I would not recommend more than two in this cage. A disadvantage is that the cage comes apart easily during cleaning if you want it to or not. Sometimes it comes apart when you try to take out the removable room located on top of the cage. We have used thin wire across the top and around the sides to prevent this from happening.
3,NOT for gerbils,"After about a month of using Critter Trail One, my two gerbils started chewing on the plastic tubes and scratching the bottom of the cage. Gerbils like to dig, so all the bedding came flying out of the cage. And they chewed on all the plastic joints inside the cage. Since then, I've bought an aquarium for them which has turned out to be a whole lot better. I still have this cage, held together with masking tape, and let my gerbils play in it while I clean the aquarium. I think that the Critter Trail One is more suited for hamsters and mice."
4,Good but incomplete,"The book is very short. I has a good amount of photos, almost all of them are black and white. The book describes some good ideas and techniques for ""long exposure"" photography. There is also a section on how to take photos of the moon. For those who do their own printing, there is a section about printing as well.The paper quality is excellent.I wish the book covers other types of night photography, such as lighting, firework, and so on."
3,old technology,"very disappointing book, a book that was in the distant past a good book but not with todays cameras"
2,Never tried night photos?? You should now.,"This is the most helpful book on night photography I have found. I took a class in which all my assignments were to be done at night and so I searched for info. I have Frost's Low Light and Night book, it left me wanting. Low light is not the same as night photography. Sanderson is easy to follow and his night shots are amazing. The exposure chart is what you really need. I have it laminated and in both of my camera bags. This is TRUE photography at night."
5,Great Product,This is a wonderful product that provides immediate relief for pets with all varieties of skin irritations. Speedy delivery and well packaged. I highly recommend this product from this vendor!
4,Creepy fun,"Jumble Joan is a wonderful book, one of my five-year-old's favorites. If your child enjoys a good fright this book will provide it without turning his/her hair white. The narrator, a boy of about eight, and his friend Mick take little sister up to Grandma's attic, intending to give her a scare. Only it is the little girl, who, as the three explore the dusty treasures, ends up enjoying the boy's fright, as their imaginations take over, causing their plans to backfire. The illustrations add to the story, giving some needed information not stated in the text, to help kids work out the delightful paradox."
3,Simlar to KVFM1 but with auto-power,"The JVC KS-IF200 is similar to the Jensen KVFM1 but has a feature where it will turn on when it senses input and shut off 20 seconds after the input goes away. Crutchfield carries it.Amazon offers the ""MOBILE AUTHORITY AV-FM Universal FM Stereo Modulator"" (ASIN: B00006JPT6) which has the same auto on/off feature."
1,Unhappy Customer,"I ordered a Princess Belle doll but received Sleeping Beauty. I believe someone was ""sleeping"" at the switch. I didn't have time to wait for a return so had to scramble to find another gift in time for the birthday party. You get zero stars."
3,This is the first of two bottles of liquid you need for cleaning.,"I had used Virbac Epi-Otic prior to purchasing this product. the Epi-Otic is a single cleaning fluid that self drys. this Otifoam, on the otherhand, requires not only the foaming cleanser, but also the DVM's OtiRinse as well (which I didn't know at the time I purchased this, which is why I've rated this product as 3 stars). So, long story short, I'm still using the Epi-Otic and this OtiFoam is still in it's plastic wrap. I might pickup some of the OtiRinse If I ever run out of Epi-Otic, but then again, I really prefer a single liquid application of Epi-Otic, which works well (and I'm sure my dogs apreceate a single dose liquid too!). Hope this helps!"
5,Refreshing Viewpoints in an Old Debate,"The debate surrounding Shakespeare's Sonnets has raged on for a long time, and much of the scholarship on them has remained nebulous, repetitive, and overworked. James Schiffer's volume, however, is refreshingly brilliant and provocative: the essays he includes address an array of topics that are often overlooked, while many of the arguments are simultaneously revisionist and visionary, challenging the conventional wisdom that has guided the criticism on the Sonnets for so long. And what's even better, the arguments are beautifully and meticulously presented, crafted by some of the foremost Shakespeareans of our time."
2,High Color Ink Use,"I've only had mine for one year and only used it for photos. At first it printed well, but the paper feeder is hard to set and often misfeeds (more than one page at a time). The ink in the color cartridge dried up quickly and replacements are expensive. I've had a lot of problems with this one and even though their customer service responds quickly, they didn't always address the issue I was experiencing. I would not buy this brand again."
2,"Great printer, ink supplies will nearly bankrupt you","I have used my z705 for less than two months. The reason I gave it any stars is because the print quality is quite good for a disposable printer. Unfortunately, the black ink cartridge runs out quickly and replacements are overpriced. This is the second Lexmark I have ditched and purchased a Canon i560 instead.Pros:Good print qualityCheap priceCons:You are better off buying another brand of printer than feeding the overpriced Lexmark cartridges to this printer."
2,Publ Adv Copy (pb) Sent as Hardback,The copy sent is a publisher's advance copy (paperback). The book was offered as a hardcover. Very bad.
3,mildly interesting,"The setting, Spain in the aftermath of the civil war, was new to me. The mystery was of some interest, but it all seemed rather superficial. A summer book to read at the beach."
2,IT'S BAD! IT'S REAL! IT'S REAL BAD!,"With two notable exceptions: a few contemporary contributers, and a fine bit of archival warbling from the Bing, this recording is hollow and lifeless. I don't know what the others are talking about. There is almost nothing emotive here, and the submissions (probably washed a thousand times already), have a tinniness that recalls radio (circa 1930). Get a Phantom Menace action figure instead."
2,Good actors trapped in a hopeless mish-mash,"Although this film contains some decent performances, it just drifts along aimlessly for an hour and an half, without ever giving a full explanation as to why any of the characters behave as they do. You want dysfunctionalism? This film has it! As another reviewer stated, it's pretty much a pointless affair, with the only redeeming quality being some fine acting. The plot, (what there is of it), has to do with family turmoil coming to a head over the course of a Thanksgiving holiday, but as the film creaks along to it's rather abupt end, none of the story lines are resolved, and you're left asking what happened to the rest of the movie."
2,Not for bossa or MPB fans,"An interesting CD with highly original choice of material, on which Ms McCorkle sings in three languages. She comes off best on 'Estate' which is Italian. She sings her own lyrics to 'Manha de Carnival', 'Vivo Sonhando', 'A Felicidade' and others - interesting to have English versions, though the original Portugese sounds better than these. Ms McCorkle gives a fine demonstration of how NOT to sing bossa nova, with American over-emphasis instead of Brazilian subtlety. Her pianist is dreadful, I think, and completely out of place on these songs - loud and ultra-modern. Some tracks go on too long. Still, worth having for the rare repertoire - 'Estate' and 'Dilema'."
4,Real Estate Hints for every level of sales,"This book was recommended by several successful homebuilders for their staff. I found it to be on-target for giving positive replies to negative comments by concerned, nervous or worried customers. This should help new and experienced salespersons and boost confidence."
3,A little silly but good fun,"Not one of the great swashbucklers but enjoyable. Mo is spectacular, and keeps up with the boys admirably, especially in the sword play. Not an actress I would've chosen if there was a scene (and there is) where she was supposed to be mistaken for a boy. Of all the actresses in Hollywood, Maureen O'Hara is one of the least boy-like. It loses one star for the quality of the image--looks like the DVD was mastered from a VHS tape, resolution is mediocre. It's finally made it to DVD--not a great one but a LOT better than the VHS or import. Now if only they'd do the same for ""Fire Over Africa"" where Mo does a killer Jane Russell."
4,Girl erotica,"This is a sweet book of erotica from 1972, a la Jock Sturges' ""Last Day of Summer,"" featuring two lovely young women in states of Victorian nudity. Long-haired, willowy, pretending to innocence, backlit, these young women look around 19 years old. The ""Sisters"" title is obviously meant suggestively, as is the poetic text by Alain Robbe-Grillet. They ride bicycles in filmy dresses, recline nude in the windows of Italian villas, sit with knees up on a stone wall to show their Victorian drawers, show each other rather a lot of gentle physical affection. Tastefully done."
3,Just not detailed enough for a 5 star rating!,"While I enjoyed this book alot, I am used to and appreciate when an author actually describes the heroine. It wasn't until the middle of the book where her hair color was even alluded to! Forget her face and eye color! These descriptions bring characters to life! Please Ms. Malvey more details!!! Then I will buy another of her books until then I will stick with my favs: Monk, Kleypas, Quinn and others of their ilk.However this was a nice story so for that and if you have a very vivid imagination then go for it!"
4,A delightful Regency romp,"Despite a few flaws--mostly pertaining to compromising situations, as though both, especially the heroine, would not be more cautious of her reputation--this book is a delight to read. Witty, warm, and engrossing. The lead characters are fun and suffer none of that annoying tendency to be ridiculously obtuse. They have misunderstandings, but both are smart, thoughtful people who can figure things out well enough that they don't spend most of the book blindly stumbling about with wrong perceptions.Although the resolution of the mysterious financial matters is not completely believeable, the romance is beautifully written and brimming with passion and respect. Harriet is stupidly stubborn at one point, but it allows Steven to play out an interesting proposal scene. Their interplay is lively, sensuous, and loving.No deep heaartache here, just a heart-warming, feel-good romance that hits the right notes and leaves the reader is a great mood."
2,"Mundane, boring, tedious","I bought this book because of the very good review posted here, but six chapters into it I'm ready to give up. The characters don't appeal to me at all, and the premise - that the heroine is so embarrassed by her eccentric family that she doesn't want to know the hero - is just ridiculous. Scenes which are clearly designed for humour leave me cold, and I find I don't much care whether the hero and heroine get together.Give me a Balogh, an Oliver, a Kelly or a Jensen any day!"
1,A response...,"To Wolfgirl: I wasn't looking for earth-shattering passion, just a good book. And this wasn't it! Yes, there are plenty of great writers around, some of them who even write subtle romances, some of whom write some excellent humour. But, judging by this book, Barbara Sherrod is not one of them. I read a lot of Regencies, as you might see if you check my review page. This is one of the *very* few books I couldn't even bring myself to finish. And when I've paid good money for a book, that isn't something I do as a rule.Sure, we're all entitled to our opinions. If you liked this, great. However, I still can't recommend it and I stick by my assessment of it as tedious."
3,no numbers on vests,"The vests are nice, but the picture shows with a number on the vest. I was suprised when I opened up the order and the vest had no numbers."
4,Very Entertaining!,An interesting tale that combines history and science fiction. The concept of an engineer going back in time and applying all he knows is very entertaining ... espically to an engineer
5,Great price on 100 blades,"I havn't burned my way thru the box yet but I have used a dozen blades and each one was perfect. I havn't used them for medical purposes so cannot claim to the sterility but if I was using them for surgery, I think I'd re-sterilize them just to be safe. They are sharp like they are suppose to be and great blades at a very discounted price."
1,Expired product,"I got an expired product, manufactured 01 2008 and expired 01 2011. I don't know how this affects the sterility of the product. I sent an email to the vendor, and they offered me to return the product for exchange or refund. But since the product is cheap, it's not worth the hassle and the shipping cost to refund it. I guess that might be a part of the vendors plan to get rid of these expired products."
5,Easy and safe to use.,"The blades are sharp enough for my needs and are easy to use. Further, the packaging on the individually wrapped scalpels is easy to tear open cleanly ande safely to reach the blade."
3,Just OK,I bought these for dermaplaning and there's some significant difference in the sharpness of the edge from blade to blade. The quality control just isn't there. But you get what you pay for.
5,Perfect for my surgical kit,"Bought these for practice on animal tissue to prepare for a time when there are no doctors. Perfect......sharp.....fit the kit I bought . Well packaged, arrived quickly. I am a medical professional. Would not recommend any time of surgical cutting for someone who has no training....."
5,Model Building & Electronic Work,"I have been building plastic & wood models since I was a small boy (now 50). I have been using surgical blades to cut and trim my models for about 30 years now. They hold a very sharp blade, and unlike the modeling knives that have been released by various companies, these are very inexpensive in bulk and easily interchangeable on a scalpel."
1,Very Dull,"This blade is very very dull. It is single edged, and is similar to a butter-knife. Do not purchase if you need a sharp blade."
2,Sony blows,"ok i bought this product 2 days ago...and im already have a ton of problems with it, it hit really good for the 1st day, im running a 15 inch Crunch power sub and this amp...and now it will run for about 15 seconds then go into Off Set mode, and the only way to get it off is to turn ur reciever off or ur car, no way to stop it from going into off set mode either, its a piece"
4,As expected,"So far, so good. I've set this up to be an UPS for our furnace. (Not what's it's designed for, I know). A different model without a true sine-wave reproduction wouldn't work, but this one holds the load fine, both on startup and to run the furnance for a good 30+ minutes. I'd previously blown multiple components on our furnace due to bad power or surges, and this also allows me the comfort of at least being able to run the system for a short period during an extended blackout; enough to limit the chance of it freezing since it's really our backup heat source anyway.This unit may not have the LCD/bells-and-whistles that some others do, but the actual power features make it capable of doing what several APC units couldn't for less cost than one of the APC Smart-UPS units with comparable features would have been.I'd give it five-stars, but I usually save that for something that exceeds my expectations. Thus far, nothing about it has made me feel that way, but that's not a complaint either."
1,Doesn't support Mac OS,"It doesn't support Mac OS, despite having a Mac icon on the box next to the Windows icon. WTF? Email from support:Unfortunately, the PP series would not be able to be used with theEnergy Saver for the Mac.Thanks,Jeff PetersonTech SupportCyberPower Systems"
1,"way too many ""helps"" in the back","We ordered this for our daughter who is just beginning to read. There are about 50 pages or so of Bible ""helps"" in the back, some of which were good, some of which were written from a theological stance we can't agree with. Too bad they didn't just publish this as a Bible without all the ""explanations"" at the back, and leave it to parents, grandparents, etc. to do the explaining. Otherwise, it is a nice edition of the ESV, with nice pictures for children."
5,A Kids Bible that isn't Moronic,"When my seven year old son decided that he wanted his own Bible, I knew it would be difficult to find the right one for him. He has been reading my bible for a while, and said he would like it if there were pictures. We looked around for a week or so and finally found this Bible. It is fabulous. It does have pictures and is definitely geared for kids, but it is a real Bible. All the books are there, and they are un-abridged. Even better, it comes in the ESV which is a solid conservative translation."
5,Love it!,"I absolutely love this Bible. We purchased two for our two boys. They are learning to have a ""quiet time"" and are memorizing scripture. We love the ESV translation as well. Only request -- make one in a soft cover!! (That fake leather stuff is great!)"
4,Childrens Bible,I bought 3 Children's Bibles in the English Standard Version by Crossway Bibles for my Grandchildren ages 6-9. I love them and so do the kids. They are real bibles with all the text. This is important to me as most children's bibles I've seen are either just a few bible stories or regular adult bibles with a childish looking cover. Also these bibles are beautifully illustrated. The kids and I get together a couple of times a week for bible study and they really are learning to use their bibles. My ONLY complaint is that I would have liked to have them in a leatherette cover instead of hard cover however this is a small point. I have one more grandaughter too young to read yet and I will be buying another one for her very soon.
5,Awesome!,"I have looked over many children's bibles in search of one I thought would be good for my kids. I'd almost given up but then I found the ESV Children's Bible! It more than surpasses my expectations for a children's bible. I bought one for my oldest and after looking it over, I ordered three more for my other kids who will receive them when they are old enough to read."
5,Just what I have been looking for!,I have been looking for a children's bible that isn't just a story book and this is it. It's the complete bible with a hard cover and some pictures. The type is a little bigger so it's easier for our son to read. There are also some great study material included. I would HIGHLY recommend this bible!
2,Dented Case,I recieved the case and after finding a medium size dent in the case I contacted the company where I purchased it(47th Street Photo) - I never heard back from them about replacement or compensation - so to say I would recommend this to someone else would be a resounding NO! Lousy customer service and damaged products should keep anyone away from this case and 47th Street Photo.
3,Great Pictures but couple minor issues,"First of all, the price for this TV fluctuates, but Amazon was quick in refunding the difference in the prices (I paid $257 more only 3 weeks prior).The picture is great, but the TV makes this fairly loud buzzing noise when it's on. The noise is constant and is audible during quiet moments in a TV show. One other issue is HDMI connection, the TV takes a few seconds to search for a chancel when I simply press the 'channel up/down' buttons.Update on 1/16/08:I returned this Samsung TV because the buzzing noise is just too loud for a bedroom TV. I paid a lot more and got a Sony Bravia XBR KDL-52XBR4 instead. I'm very happy with my Sony TV, and it was worth the extra cost for me."
4,Samsung television,"Great experience overall. My television actually arrived 1 week prior to the anticipated delivery date. The tv was intact and the delivery person actually assisted me in placing the television in my entertainment center and with its connection. The television is awesome, with vibrant colors and HD capabilities. The only detraction is that the tv sound quality is average. I hope to rectify that soon with a home entertainment sound system. Overall, great tv thus far and excellent service from amazon.com."
5,Super Buy!!!!,"This high quality product is the very same model selling at major retail stores for $1,000.00 less. Get it while you can!!!"
2,Great Until the Power Supply Fails.,"This television was great until the power supply died two months after the warranty expired. If you do a search, you'll find that this is a pretty common problem. I was given an estimate of about $500 to repair it. I opted to by a new one from a different manufacturer."
5,Samsung 5084 is a marvel,"This TV is the bomb. An HD bomb. I shopped around for a 50 inchplasma and ended up buying this one. It is limited only by what youfeed it. If you feed it jaw dropping data you will get a jaw droppingpicture. It's that simple. This is the most ""CRT"" type image I've seenon a panel TV. If you are looking for a 50 inch plasma, be sure andsee one of these. Just be sure it's being fed good material and isproperly adjusted. Same for any TV you consider buying.good viewing, ccs"
1,BEWARE OF POWER SUPPLY BURNOUTS,"I bought this TV in December 2007. Since then, the power supply has burned out 4 times. Thank goodness I bought the 4-year warranty. My warranty expires in December, 2011, so I know they will not sell me another warranty. Best Buy is coming out to recommend that my TV be replaced. One repairman told me they used power supply units that were not adequate in these sets. Otherwise, I really loved the color, clarity, and everything about it. I was ok the first year, then all the problems started. Beware......"
1,Worst TV I have ever owned !,"I purchased my FPT5084 in 2008. After it went out of warranty, the power supplied failed ($370). Today, that power supply went out, again. Another $370 ? I think not ! I just purchased a Panasonic P50S30 for $844 (half of what I paid for the worthless FPT5084). Don't get me wrong, when the Samsung was working, the picture was great ! I just cannot afford more power supplies. I would recommend not buying a Samsung !"
5,Great TV!,I have had the TV for over a month now. It is more than worth the money! The picture is amazing. The sound is fine (I only heard a buzzing sound once the second time I used the tv. Since then I have not heard it).I would highly recommend this product!
5,Love it love it love it!!!,"The TV ROCKS!!! No more to say here! One of the top ten HDTV's of 2007 according to cnet and I agree.A small glitch with the company contracted to deliver it. As other reviewers have stated, be proactive and call the company early and often to make sure no delivery issues exist. That said, once the issue was resolved (a data entry error that started with Amazon actually) the tv was delivered professionally with free white glove delivery. I never thought I would spend so much money on a tv on Amazon but I have to admit, they had the best price and included free white glove delivery so I went for it and haven't regretted it."
2,Not for me,"I returned the FPT5084 50"" Plasma I purchased after 2 weeks. The first few days I thought it was great. It had a nice picture, but then I started noticing a buzzing sound. When I had the volume off or low, it was very noticeable. It was coming from the back metal cover. When I pressed my finger on it, it got louder. I decided I didn't want to wast anytime and return it. I now prefer the color on my new LCD TV made by a different manufacturer. I don't need to worry about burn-ins, and there is no buzzing. Actually, it was more of a bizzzzzing."
2,samsung 1080p plasma,big mistake to purchase this plasma.i do not know why other buyers are happy about picture.my 3 year old panasonic blows it away and it is only 1080i.buzzing from back of tv makes it tough to hear at night when you lower the volume and throws off a ton of heat.if you want a plasma which i prefer look close at panasonic.
4,excellent picture,"I'm very satisfied with this television overall. It has a great picture, was easy to install. However, occasionally I do hear some little popping noises coming from the set, which I'm hoping is nothing. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and got it at a super price, much lower than any t.v. sold around my neighborhood."
2,Good Product - Horrible Customer Service,I've had this TV for over a year. The TV is easy to use with lots of nice features and it gets a nice picture. After several months of use the power supply went out while the TV was still under warranty.The customer service and warranty repair service is horrible. It took almost 3 weeks to get someone to the house to repair the TV. Hour's on the phone with Samsung and all they do is blame the 3rd party service provider that they contract the work out to. This is the last Samsung product I will ever buy. I have purchase 2 additional flat panel TV's since this TV from other manufactures.
4,not bad for a third movie,"This story is not as spiritual as the second Balto movie. That may reassure some sensitive viewers: no Native American spiritual practices or beliefs are aired/promoted/conveyed. Kodiak, one of Balto's sons, is the center figure that sets the tone of the story when his sled team is challenged to outrace an air plane delivering mail. The goose is back, with a she-goose that is stereotypically Russian femme-fatale. He has problems because he is afraid to fly, and she wants to have a romantic flight...Balto has to help the other dogs rescue the pilot when he becomes lost in a storm. the fighting and social cruelty of ""Balto"" is missing from this story, but it teaches a few lessons about setting right priorities, being honest in a relationship, and caring for others even if they are disliked. A feel-good movie, definitely child-safe."
2,This sequel sucks as well.,"I say both Balto films II & III were very poorly done in my opinion. The idea for a sequel was a good one, but Universal craped that up. Balto II was a ripoff of The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride (that is for another review though), whereas this (as other reviewers have pointed out) one strays from the wolf part of the story. Also the idea of putting songs in these films was just stupid. This trash is not worth buying. The only reason I give this 2 stars is for the interesting characters, along with their voice work, and animation."
4,Family Fav,"I bought Balto 1, 2, and 3 with the intention of offering simple family fun without any violence and bloodshed and so far it has worked."
2,Ugg....,"This movie wasn't very good at all to me. It seems to really make Balto a cartoon charector like the people on a kid's channel, not a dog that saved an entire town! Stella was a purebred bird brain. #2 had alot of magic in it, which I like. Balto #1 was a little goofy at times but it still had the basic plan of a dog saving a town. This movie on the otherhand, was plainly just not good! It seems like they just made it to amuse veiwers, not to send a message like the other two did! I say you sould rent only, not buy."
3,#1 & #2 ARE MUCH MUCH BETTER!,"Now, this was an ok movie. You never see Aleu again whick I was hoping for. Balto's son, Kodiak, is sort of a jerk at first then he gets nicer. It's ok to watch once but not twice! So many people are complaining that #2 is so weird. I don't think so! #2 was great! Buy or rent 1 o2 but don't waste $4 on Balto 3!"
4,"surprised, and pleased","many people so far have said that this balto wasnt so good. an thats cool, whatever. but honsetly, i thought #3 kicked the butt of #2. of course the original balto is the best of all and none can ever top that, but when i watched number 2 i was really disapointed. the characters kind of lost their background and it was like someone just made another movie with the same characters to try and pull it off as a sequal. plus the animation really sucked. #3 still has some flaws but is definatly cleaner than #2. it seems a little closer to #1 and everything blends much better. well, at least i thought so. buy it or not, but come on at least rent it! if you hate it thats that but it is worth watching, or at least i say so."
3,better than 2 but still not great!,This wasn't as silly as Balto 2 but even my younger children would rather watch Balto 1 for the fortieth time than this one for the 2nd time.Don't waste your money!
3,It's all right.,"It's way better then the Wolf Quest(blagh) but obviously nowhere as good as the first. Despite a few scenes, the bit with moose being one scene I feel they could've done without, and the songs, I was rather pleased with it. The one thing I like about this film is some of the adult content that's in it, which I feel is missing with a lot of today's annimated films.I just hope to God they don't make a forth."
3,Question,"Can anyone tell me if the only version available on DVD is Full Screen. I'd like to get Widescreen, but have only seen Full Screen in stores, and Amazon doesn't specify..."
4,Very useful!,"I bought this product to use all my gadgets and it works very well. It is small, sleak and it does not heat up. Only problem is that the wireless mouse is slow and sometimes gets stuck. So I had to plug the mouse directly to the laptop. Apart from this small inconvenience, it is a great product."
2,Not Disappointed,"I am disappointed in this product. It will not work with my mouse or keyboard or IPod. OOPs! Helps if you connect the hub to the computer, Yikes! Now works fine."
1,Power supply is smaller than before,This is to let people know that the power supply in the current version is only 2.5 amps rather than the 4 amps it used to be. Hence it no longer provides full power to all 7 ports at the usb spec of .5a per port.
1,Be warned,"I bought this item based on previous positive experience with Kensington products. This product however greatly failed. The unit comes with an insufficient AC adapter. I used this hub with just my iPhone and a USB mouse. I plugged the hub into my MacBook Pro. After barely 1 minute (literally), my mouse did not work. Using my trackpad, I found that my iPhone was no longer mounted. I unplugged the hub from my laptop and plugged it back in. It worked fine - for another minute. The hub is greatly underpowered by the AC adapter. I was only using two ports on it. And this is supposed to handle seven connections? Don't buy it. I replaced it with the Belkin 4-port Desk Hub and it works beautifully."
3,Marginal Functionality,"All in all a well designed product, performs well, however does have some issues.Have issues with intermittent problems with iMac (intel, OS X 10.5). Need to periodically unplug from iMac, reboot and then reconnect. Intermittently causes extremely long boot issues. Have isolated issue to USB Hub itself. Have two and they both suffer from same problem.Am looking for a more Mac stable solution.No noted issues yet when used with Windows."
5,Very functional and pretty to boot,"Like all Kensington products, this USB hub is beautifully made, sturdy, and works very well. It looks great on the desktop. This unit has seven USB ports; three on the back and four on the front. It is powered by an AC cable, so it can provide power to devices that require power from the USB port. On Windows 7 the PocketHub installed in seconds and was ready to go. I immediately plugged in several devices including a USB iPod cable, and everything went right to work and was immediately functional. Can't ask for more than that. Recommended. RJB."
1,doesn't cut it at all,"I bought one less than a month ago and already half the ports have stopped working. I don't know much about the power supply, but I currently have a printer(powered on it's own), 2 hard drives (also powered on their own) all plugged in on the side with the 3 outlets and not of the 4 on the other side are working enough to open a usb memory card. Lame. I would suggest buying from a different company, I'm going to try and get my money back from apple."
1,Stopped Working,"Although this device was clearly created with ease of use in mind, it stopped working within a week of using it. Only three of the ports were being used when this happened. Until this company is able to refund my money, I will advise all electronic users to refrain from purchasing items from this brand."
1,will not work with the ipad,"I cannot believe that Apple is selling this when the device is not compatible with the iPad, even when plugged in directly into the wall."
5,Excellent hub for someone with a lot of USB devices,"I have a MacBook Pro, which only comes with two USB ports. That becomes an issue when you have two external HDDs, a printer, iPod, and game controller to plug in. So, naturally, I was looking for a hub with plenty of ports. This is definitely a winner. I am actively using every last port this has, and I can have both of my Freeagent Go drives plugged in with no problem thanks to the power adapter this hub comes with. That power adapter also means I can charge my iPod while the computer is off or asleep.Bottom line: if you have a lot of USB devices, especially ones that will need extra power to function, this is definitely a hub to consider, if not purchase."
5,Kensington......ALWAYS good stuff!,A prefer Kensington 'cause it always works or Kensington makes it right.This hub is no exception. Just plug a play!!!!!!
2,BUYER BEWARE... 6 Months and I Need to Replace,"I bought this hub 6 months ago. All ports were taken until half of them just quit working. This week, I lost a port on the other side and a matter of time before the whole unit is useless. I need to replace ASAP. It looks nice, but don't let that fool you. Not worth it. If you plan on keeping things plugged in all the time, look for something else. I've had HUBS in the past which lasted me 6 + more YEARS!!!"
4,Kensington USB 7 port Hub,Great product. Easy simple / setup. The USB ports are spaced far enough apart so you can use all 7 ports.
4,Happy with the first so I bought another,I had previously purchased one and was happy with it so I bought another and now have 14 ports available for my laptop. As a side note I had originally tried the belkin 7 port usb hub and was unhappy with it- It kept crashing/freezing my laptop.
3,Not that great,"Not that great of an item. When I wanted two external harddrives hooked up, it would drop one, so I could not transfer files in between them, even though I had the external power connected. Before when I did not have it connected, it would not even pick up the external harddrive (I have seagate and western digital both 320 gb). I bought this so that I would not have to hog both of my ports and connect several harddrives, but I guess it takes up too much power for the hub to handle. A bit disappointed, but it's not that bad of a buy."
1,"Ports die, one by one","Used for printer and digital cameras to have a hub within easy reach of the camera USB cable. Port 1 stopped working within a month and I thought it was a fluke. Port 2 worked for over a year and then suddenly died as well. Port 3 only lasted a week. The rest still work but I replaced the hub with another inexpensive one from Staples. The printer port never failed so maybe by not removing the cable constantly protected it. The failures are not mechanical (bad pins, cold solder joints, etc.), but are electronic. Rebooting the hub or computer made no difference. Been using hubs the same way since the late 90s without ever a problem. How can a hub be so unreliable?"
1,Should have read the negative before buying,"Yep, this thing worked fairly well for awhile (over a year) but it never seemed to work right when I plugged in my iPad or iPhone. It either didn't charge them or my Macbook Pro didn't recognize them. I thought 'no big deal' I'll just plug those items in directly into the Mac. Well, today my laptop won't recognize anything coming out of this hub: my back up drive, my printer, my track ball nothing, nada, zip. I honestly don't understand how a simple hub could go bad just sitting behind my lap top. Easiest job on the desk and it crapped out."
1,Omg!!,This stuff is HORRIBLE!!!!!! It says to wait to have liquids before and after you take this.....but I don't know how you could choke it down otherwise. It is so strong it burns your throat. There are better options out there to increase milk quality and quantity. I bought a tea and a capsule with much more satisfaction. I would've given this 0 stars if I could've.
3,"Very Strong taste, too soon to say if it works","I have been using this product for 3 days now and I have not seen an increase in milk production. The instructions say to avoid liquids 15 minutes before and after for maximum results but the taste so bad and strong and it burns how on earth can you take it any other way aside from adding it to a liquid??? I will followup in a week to let you know what happens. At the moment, not impressed.Follow up Review- It's been well over a week of course. And I have to say it does increase milk production. I have not build up a stash while continuing to nurse my 9 month old."
2,Waste of money for me,"Since there are a ton of variables that go into milk supply, I would never say this product would be ineffective for everyone, but it certainly was for me. I started taking it right before my son started on solids at 6 months, partially because he hadn't gained ""enough"" weight the month before and because I was very nervous about my milk supply dropping when solids started. I took it according to recommendations - I actually took it with absolutely no water or food (it certainly isn't the worst tasting thing I've ever had in my mouth). I finished the bottle and saw no difference in my supply during or after finishing it. I work 3 days a week and pump twice a day on those days. I was pumping about 4 oz a pump before starting the tincture; pumped about 4 oz while taking it; pump about 4 oz after finishing it. No difference whatsoever!"
4,Great deal!!,I got 8 oz (2 bottles) for what I normally pay for 6 oz (3 small bottles) at my local store. Plus it qualified for free shipping! I always recommend this tincture or More Milk Plus to moms looking to increase their supply. It helped me after I went back to work.
4,Pretty Nasty Tasting...But Effective!,"Believe the hype...More Milk Special Blend does taste pretty awful, like a bad batch of Jagermeister. However, it works, and for me, within hours! My son would normally take two breasts at feeding time. Now he can get away with one.I am taking one star off because I ordered this item during the trial period which guaranteed 2-day delivery and I didn't receive this product until 6 days later. I think I would have been quite upset shelling out $70/year for a service from this site that doesn't stand by what it promises."
1,"The item had ""DAMAGED"" written on it","I paid over $25 to have this item shipped over night. I did get my package the next day, but the item was in a bag and there was liquid from the bottle all in it. It also had the word ""Damaged"" written on the bag. The top was broken on the bottle and someone just put tape on the top to try and keep it closed. This is my first time with this company. I contacted them via email the same day and never even got a response back. I had to wait until Monday to call them since my order arrived on Saturday and they are closed on the weekends. I had a very negative experience with this company. I couldn't even use my new product! I called the company and they told me I had to call Amazon which I did. Amazon couldn't even give me a new one free of charge. They just gave me a refund. I needed this product ASAP and now I have to wait longer due to someone else's mistake!"
3,It Doesn't Taste Very Good,"It does the trick and helps with milk production. It is a good quality product, but it does not taste good at all. I tried another brand that tasted much better."
2,Returned it after a month,"For a 2.4 GHz phone, the range was horrible. I got much better reception with my old 900 MHz. Also, it would be nice if the channels automatically changed when needed, since the reception was so bad (you had to change often). The caller ID was also weird in that if you picked up the phone and missed the call, that number wouldn't be in the caller ID. Overall, we were surprisingly very unhappy with the phone, and just returned it."
2,poor reliability for a Motorola product,"I purchased this model about 1.5 years ago and expected it to perform for 5-10 years. It stopped working after a year and a half with the buttons not responding at all. I bought a new battery in hopes that would fix the problem, but the phone still does not work. I even tried the page button on the base stand and the pager works, but had to unplug the battery to stop the phone from beeping. I expected better reliability from a Motorola product. I have been using a Sony remote phone for the past six years (we have two phones) and it is still working well. I guess you just have to buy a product nowdays and take your chances."
1,Four months of static and then nothing...,"I got about four months of life out of this phone. There was consistently static and then the phone started to die mid conversation. I bought a new battery, which didn't fix the problem. Now I get about 10 seconds tops before the phone cuts out (but doesn't die, so I know it's not the battery)."
1,Poor Sound Quality,"I liked this phone for the first few days. I actually convinced a friend to buy the same phone.What I discovered on BOTH my phone and my friend's phone is that voices get clipped, ie, cut off prematurely and you have a ""cell phone going out of range like quality"" to the conversation even though you are only a few feet from the base unit. I suspect this is a design issue, where to save battery power, the phone cuts off transmission when it thinks no voice is present even though you are still speaking. I use cordless phones all the time for routine conversations and this one is just annoying. That's a shame because its a nice size, battery life is great, and so is the price."
1,I hate this phone,"I have the phone/answering machine model. More than half of the time the caller ID doesn't save the missed calls (so you can at least see who called you while you were out), but my biggest complaint is that you have to listen to all of the saved messages again to get to the new messages. What a waste of time."
3,skeptic,"I purchased mine in May '04. So far no problems but the phone is rarely used. I was going upgrade to additional models but I think I will hold out and see how long this one lasts. I was skeptical purchasing a motorola model after working for a cellular company and motorola's answer to all phone problems was one of three things your carrier, physical damage or water damage. Like I said so far no problems, clear sound and battery lasting a good length of time."
2,"Nice styling, poor sound quality","There is a lot I like about this phone, however none of what I like outweighs the fact that the sound quality is so bad I had to take it back within the first week of buying it. The appearance, weight, features and price were all excellent. BUT when I spoke to someone on the phone, my voice (and surrounding noise) came through my earpiece like a loudspeaker! It's as if the mouthpiece is a microphone playing through the earpiece amplifier. Very annoying and impossible to have a conversation with anyone unless they are a real yapper and don't let you say a word anyway! I don't recommend buying this one at all."
2,disappointed,The display on our phone quit after only one year. After two years we had so much static on the phone we could no longer hear the other person. Changing the channel no longer worked. The last cordless phone I bought lasted me fifteen years. This on died after only two. Even when the phone did work the volume was way too low even though you can control the volume it did a poor job.
3,"good grippy feel, but interferes with WiFi","The rubbery sides feel nice, and the keypad had a gentle glow when the phone is in the base, just enough to let you find the phone in the dark. And the volume can be turned up nice & loud.The bad part is that it's on the same freq as WiFi. Our phone & WiFi worked together well until recently. Now the only way we can consistently get a dialtone on ANY phone in the house is to completely disconnect the wireless phone base from the wall."
3,Absolutely fine except......,"After having this phone for about a year and a half, I like it enough to keep it. The volume is plenty loud, reception is pretty good and battery life is acceptable. But the most dumb problem which is a design error, is you can hear your own voice through the ear piece. This should not be. If you have any other phone, you will see that you can not hear your own voice through the ear piece and if you do, it's very minimal. But on this phone you hear it as loud as if not louder then the person you are talking to. And unless you're in a hollywood movie where you say your line and then the other person says there line, you'll be battling for phone supremacy with your own voice."
1,"If you like ringing in your ears, buy this phone!!","This one of the worst phones I ever brought!!!!The phone is less than 2 months old and it gives echoes, feedback, ringing and you cannot talk while the microwave is in use.I gave it 1 star because I could not give it anything less.It does offer some good features, like the format button. Which is a time saver. But overall, DO NOT BUY!!!!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!Thank you."
2,Looks good but that's it,I bought this phone for my apartment and really had no trouble with it for a few months. Then I moved into a house and suddenly there is so much static in the phone I can't stand it. You cannot hear anybody with the static and it continues to beep like you are pressing the buttons while you are talking even when it is fully charged. I am so disappointed in this phone. I am off this weekend to get a different phone that works. I don't recommend waisting your money on this phone.
2,Not real happy with this phone,"I've had this phone for about 6 months. It started out great, but the longer I've had it, the worse the sound got. It started making a clicking/staticky noise that doesn't go away even when you switch channels. The v-mail message indicator light doesn't work, and when you try to check the caller ID, you have to push the button 10 or 15 times before it finally decides to show you the names and numbers. On the plus side, it's comfortable to use, you can turn the ringer off, and the keypad lights up making it easy to use in the dark. It's a fairly inexpensive phone, so I would have to say I've gotten my money out of it, but I would not purchase it again."
2,Keep the Box.,"I loved this phone at first. It's nicely human-factored, and the sound quality was very good.However, it's now about 6 weeks old and the ""3"" button no longer works. I use the phone only for work, so it's been gently used and no one has been dropping it in the sink. This is not impressive longevity. Fortunately, the store where I bought it has a 90-day return policy. I don't think the replacement will be a Motorola."
2,"Downhill, fast!","This phone was good for the first few month, but has gone downhill ever since. The speaker is not very loud and the ringer is very hard to hear even in a quiet room. I bought one of these for myself and one for my mother, and both phones now have a lot of static when making calls even standing next to the base station. Range is good, if you can deal with the static (changing channels doesn't help). The base station is supposed to indicate when there is a message waiting with our phone provider, but it often gives false positives and misses other calls. We bought a panasonic now and everything is much better, even the message waiting indicator."
2,STATIC,I just bought this phone 3 days ago and I have had a problem witht he static coming from the handset while the phone is one the base. It is loud and annoying. I initally liked the way the phone looked and after using it I thought it was a really good buy until the static started. It will be returned today.
1,Intermittant static when on base!,"I liked this phone until I got it home. When the handset is sitting on the base, the handset will intermittantly emit static every few seconds - CONSTANTLY. But only when its sitting on the base. I even took it to work and tried plugging it in at my desk and it did the same thing (I live in an older house and thought it might be the 50+ year old electrical - nope!) I've had it for 5 days and its going back tonight."
2,Motorola Cordless Phone,"We bought this phone after a long search for a new phone. We have a Sony which worked wonderful and we have had it for over 5 years. We needed another phone in the house so we purchased this one. It worked in the room where the base was and that was pretty much it. The minute you went out into another room, the phone would get a lot of static. It was pretty annoying and we tried switching channels to move to a better channel and nothing seemed to work. We weren't happy with the product at all which is surprising considering it's a motorola. Be careful when you consider buying this phone."
3,Bought for School,I bought this book for school. We read certain excerpts from the book and not the whole thing. I wouldn't say it is a great read.
3,Disappointed,"I got this backpack for my daughter, she loves it but after a month and a half the zipper does not work and I can not fix it.I am hoping they will exchange it due to the seller does not state on the description that the zipper is PLASTIC which makes it hard to fix if something goes wrong with it. Now it is on Clearance and I wonder Why? If I get this again, because at the moment I just want an exchange, and it does tha same thing, I don't know what to think or do because not sure if it is us or material defect on it."
3,"NIce text, but no interactive table of contents","Finally a (more or less) complete collection of Teasdale's works, but this edition does not have a clickable table of contents. A note to DigiReads: is it really that hard to make an interactive table of contents? I can do it with Mobipocket Creator, why can't you?"
2,Cute Kid; Horrible Movie,"We had to see this movie, just because we ADORE Booboo Stewart, but honestly, it's a truly horrible film. Booboo is cute as ever, though, and a decent actor even at 11 years old, so if you're a fan, don't miss it. Otherwise, skip it altogether."
5,I enjoyed it!,"Being a fan of Booboo Stewart I had to see this movie, and yes it is not the greatest and has its bad acting moments. Overall it was a really good movie and I thought was just as worthy as any of the Omen flicks. I would recommend it to any fan!!"
5,An Interesting man at the heart of an interesting time,I enjoyed the book. Mr. Sumner is a difficult man to understand. He is a bit of an odd duck. The author does a good job covering her topic. The book helped further my understanding of the very troubling time before the Civil War. He seemed to be at the center of it-- often under very unusual circumstances.I felt that this is really just volume 1. Mr. Sumner most productive works and central part in history takes place after the book is ended. I hope the author completes the story otherwise the reader is left with a partial picture.
5,ENJOYABLE!,"I loved this movie! Why? Because it had humor, romance and the understanding that just because a friendship isn't sweet and gooey all the time, doesn't mean it's not worth it's weight in gold.Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann Margaret and Burgess Meredith head up the characters in this show and they do an outstanding job of bringing their characters to life.Two bachelors (Jack and Walter) live next door to each other. Their entire purpose in life is to bicker with each other. It's what keeps them alive, but when lovely Ann Margaret moves in across the street the call of the wild hits each one as they battle for her attention. You are not sure which one you want sweet Ann Margaret to chose. I enjoyed this movie and recommend it if you want to watch something that leaves you with a smile!"
4,Another Lemmon/Matthau Winner!,"I loved this movie when I first saw it in the theater. It was released on Christmas Day 1993, which was perfect timing. It has a nice, warm Christmas ""feel"" to it. And lots of snow. Jack and Walter are great again (as usual). Lots of good-natured gags throughout. (The fish-rotting-in-the-back-seat gags are a standout! Matthau's reaction to the horrific-smelling trout is hysterical!) Keep it running at the end for that hilarious outtake reel. Burgess Meredith is a riot. Great fun!"
4,Believable,Time and again I watch this movie. It makes me laugh every time. It is well written. You can believe the characters are people who do exist in the real world. It is set in a small town where the three of the main characters have known each other all their lives.
1,DVD no justice for movie,"I was under the impression that DVDs were developed for better quality, definitely not the case with this movie. This movie is seriously cheated due to its poor quality DVD. The worst problem is with images tracing behind when things move quickly on the screen (viewed on LCD or tube). Also annoying are certain times where frames are dropped and the picture skips. As if these things aren't bad enough, there is no widescreen version available.As for the movie it's one of the greats. Jack Lemmon, Walter Mathau, Ann-Margret, Burgess Meredith, Ozzie Davis, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah this cast says it all!"
3,About as interesting as a hallmark card.,"It started off ok, but got slow and predictable as it went on. Could inspire you to wanna go to bed early. All that snow made me wanna hibernate. The irreverent outtakes as the credits roll are about the best part of this film."
5,GREAT movie....good Blu-Ray....FINALLY widescreen though!,"Just picked it up today and couldn't wait to view...The bad news first..no bonus features...just a trailer. The good news? It is FINALLY in widescreen!! Now...the picture quality is what I was really wondering about. Its tough to judge because I don't know the source material but I think this is as good as they could do and frankly given the age of the actors , too sharp much of the time! I should say that its mostly available light looking and mostly drab and overcast so I think its pretty good as blu-rays go. I paid a bit over $10 and I'm delighted...sure I'd have been happy for some PR interviews the actors did as bonus items but for a crisp and finally Widescreen version of this movie I'm happy. Oh..I didn't bother to review the movie its been done enough....with Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, Davis and Buck Henry ,not to mention nice support from Hannah and Pollak...at least a minor classic."
1,Grumpy Young Reviewer!,"Grumpy Old Men is probably one of the best movies of both Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and the DVD for this funny, delightful movie should also be available in the original aspect ratio in wide-screen not just in the edited full-screen. There are movies that are really very awful that have wide-screen DVDs but a really very good movie like this doesn't and that's just not right! The 1 star is for the crummy DVD not the movie! I was excited when I saw that there was another DVD edition and I clicked on the link thinking that finaly a wide.screen DVD was made but to my disappointment it was just this and the sequel in one package and still both movies in full.screen! BOO!"
1,-4 for the DVD. +5 for the movie.,"The film= two classic funny guys doing what they do best. Making us laugh. Great film about two old guys being themselves. The film really does a great job of showing two old friends being crazy during retirement.The problem is the DVD= it's a barebones edition with a horrible full-framing problem. There are shots where they barely have anyone in them at all. In the original frame they are both in frame so it looks like the cropper was drunk and just got parts of them. They've cut off so much of the film that I felt like I was listening more than watching. It's a HORRIBLE DVD. If you are on the fence about this then I'd recommend the Odd Couple DVD instead. If you get this full-framed version then know that it's a great film that's not very well served with this DVD. Maybe by the time you're reading this a new Special Edition has come out...I hope so, for your sake."
5,This movie is totally awesome!,This comedy is one of the funniest I have seen in years. I can watch it over and over again and still enjoy it. Walter Mattheu is absolutely hilarious. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy!!!
5,Classic comedy from north country,"All the way from the winter landscape of Wabasha, MN comes a hillarious movie of 2 old-timers fighting over a women. Some mild foul language but not vulgar enough to prohibit my support of you buying it."
4,Grumpy,"If you like to laugh, you need to see this movie. Walter Mathau is hillarious. Jack lemon is funny, too. A story of two guys after one gal - even at their age. Fishing is good, too."
2,Said it was widescreen but it is fullscreen,The product description said it was wide screen format but it is actually full screen. Buyer beware if you are looking for wide screen.
2,Poor quality,"The picture quality was terrible. I almost never give a bad review of items, but this video was worse than if I used a camera several decades old and used it to film an old TV from across the room. The sound quality wasn't much better."
4,Good Movie From 2 Comedy Greats,"First of all let me say, in this review I intend to review the movie itself, not the content of the package. I could go on and on about the lack of bonuses, the full-screen aspect ratio, and whatever else is bringing down the overall rating of this DVD, but I simply don't want to go there. After all, I view bonuses as mere ""eye candy"" -- they are not the main reason for buying a movie.Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are comedic gold. This film is no exception. I love to watch the old men bicker with each other, and watching them compete with undeniable jealousy over the same woman is hysterical. The many pranks and games they get into with each other are very funny. Watching two old men fight could never be more enjoyable!So, despite what one could call a wasted opportunity, it is still a movie well worth watching. The sequel, ""Grumpier Old Men,"" is also quite good."
5,fun to watch movie!!!!,"This movie is my all time fav!!! It's about 2 old men who spend a lifetime fighting over absolutly nothing!! It's just a perfect movie in every way. It has some adult humor and language, but still mild to fit the little ones in the family. Set in Minnesota in the middle of winter in a little town. All was calm untill a beautifull woman moves into a house across the street from who, but the Grumpy old men. And the story of the Grumpy Old Men unfolds, let me add it's a wonderfull funny story that is worth watching. The sequel to this movie is also a great film. Buy the set you will watch them over and over!!!"
2,poor choice,"I was not pleased with my purchase. The gloves were not really a small, which I have had before, but more like a medium.They were poorly stiched at the right knuckle area and gave me a re-occuring blister/raw spot at that place.They also smelled so strongly of mothballs that I had to leave them outside in the garage for several days before I could even wear them. I ended up going to a store to try on and buy a pair of new gloves to use. I will not ever buy this product online again."
3,Has a smell to them,"The gloves are very nice, are very easy to put on but they have an awful smell to them, they were treated with something to make them shine thats why I gave it 3 stars ,but nice gloves overall. alot less exspensive on amazon then in the stores."
2,If you can help it - DO NOT GET THESE,"Awful, I am very displeased with these gloves. First of all they are not completely leather. They are cheap though, that's why I guess they don't have to be. They do not offer enough padding to protect your hands, they are to tight to put any wraps on and then you have bleeding blisters. I do not work on the bag often but I'm pretty aggressive and these are NOT the right gloves for that. Cheap - yes hence 2 stars instead of 1, once again if you can help it get something better, that's built to last because of the good quality and not because they sit in the bag because you can't use them."
3,"Good glove, though light on padding..","Overall, these gloves are good for light training, but after having used them for a while, I think I'm going to have to get some that have more robust padding in the knuckle area. The fit is very good, though as another reviewer notes, they are snug with hand wraps (which I like). The leather is a nice alternative to the vinyl and neoprene common in many bag gloves because it allows your hand to breathe. My only issue is that the padding over the knuckles is thin (1/4 inch foam), and now that it has been beaten down a little, I find I have some soreness even with hand wraps."
5,Best Fighting Gloves to buy!,"At first when I started I had no gloves....:( yeah that sucked... my knuckles all tore up= not good. Had another pair of gloves that I decided to cheep out on thinking ""Why should I pay for better gloves? These other ones will due..."" Until those cheeper ones wore out and ripped and eventually fell apart. Then I said let's spend a little extra and get the good gloves. So I did, WOW what a difference! The wrist strap is great! for support around the wrist. Form bar in middle is use full when attacking bags/moving targets giving you something to hold on too.(sorta) better fist formation. Easy to take on and off and yes my knuckles weren't destroyed anymore! YES!Do yourself a favor and spend the extra buck to not hurt yourself and protect yourself. I'd say worth the buy.Enjoy ;)"
2,Not suitable for heavy bag,"In terms of quality of design and construction I will give the gloves 2.5 stars - they are leather, which is a plus, but they are rather flimsy in construction (the leather is very thin) and they are sewn to a very minimal standard. The diamaeter of the fingers is too large which causes the gloves to move around and chafe. No, I did not buy them too large.These gloves are probably ok if you are going to hit a speed bag but that is about it. If you use them to hit a heavy bag you will have bloody hands in about forty minutes. My first and second knuckles on both hands were bloody on my first workout. After my hands healed I wrapped them well and tried again but the gloves simply do not provide enough protection to hit a heavy bag for any extended period. These gloves should not be sold as ""bag gloves"". You have been told."
2,Ouch,"I bought a new pair to replace gloves of the same type I have use for years (they were stolen). While I loved the old ones, Century seems to have changed the lining to a rougher material almost like canvas. Now I have no skin on my knuckles. I know I could use hand wraps but the point of bag gloves is so I don't have to use wraps.Overall construction is still very good but beware the bloody knuckles."
5,Great gloves.. no wrap needed,"These are some of the best feeling/fitting gloves that I could find and try out. I tried them out in a store and ended up buying them on amazon. Other MMA style bag gloves feel like there is just one big piece of foam covering your whole hand including fingers, while these gloves feel much more natural and have great protection for your hands."
3,Nice gloves but mine split after 2 years.,"As stated, my left glove split after 2 years of training with it 2 times a week for 1 hour. I used them for a Krav Maga class and most of the use was pad striking drills and light grappling. If it was sparring or competition I would understand but I felt they should've lasted a little longer. Other than that, they were great! The bar under the fingers feels really comfortable for punching but gets in the way if you do palm strikes or any other open handed technique. Drying is a little tough since they don't have an open palm, and they do get a little hot during training."
2,Great Gloves,I already have a pair in the XL size. I bought the bigger size so that myTITLE Platinum Hybrid Gel Fist Wrapswould fit.I use these 2-3 times a weekThere is a very strong smell. These stink very bad. I sprayed them with fabreeze and its still there.I originally gave this a 5 star review based on the ones I already had. The smell that wont go away got these downgraded. Its a horrible smell.
3,Smelly,"Gloves themselves are great but there is a very strong petroleum odor, almost toxic, that lasted for weeks and is still there. I washed them with softener sheets etc. Better but not gone. Very annoying."
5,Love these gloves,"These gloves are padded enough for use in sparring class as well as bag work. I like these gloves so much more than the plastic-dipped foam gloves Century makes. These may not be legal on the tournament circuit, but for day-to-day workouts they're great.One downside: The black dye bleeds after several uses. My hands up midnight blue after my workouts which is kind of gross and annoying. The gloves are leather and don't come with cleaning instructions, so good luck."
5,SO FUN!!!!!!!!!,"This game is the best ever!! You can earn patches for certain games and play classic 1980's type games! The only thing that isn't so good about it is the graphics, which aren't quite all that great. But this game is still a blast and I love it!!!"
4,good,"This is a good book, with all the songs being very thorough, and long. It's just hard not being able to play the 'main' line, as well as the 'main' background notes, like the ones you hear in the songs. You'll need 3 hands if you want to play the song in its entirety. Still a good book, with all the songs being at least 5 pages long."
5,Amazing Record by Mr. Folds,"In ""Songs for Silverman"", Ben Folds takes his music to new heights. To me, this album mixes the best of ""Reinhold Messner"" with the intimate parts of ""Rockin' the Suburbs"", making this album truly a treat!"
3,Ho Humm!,"Gilbert Ryle's philosophical pamphlet ""Dilemmas"" is enlightening, but somewhat perplexing. The grandiloquent claims on the back cover draw you in and start you reading, but by the eleventh page I found myself with an almighty headache! Congratulations to the authour on attempting to simplify such a complex subject (namely Determinism), but it is a task which I feel is well nigh impossible! One day I will attempt to read it cover to cover. In the meantime, I will grapple with my own views on a Newtonian universe"
2,This is NOT the 101 minute as advertised,"It's the 88 minute version. Yeah, it's a ""slow"" film but I always wonder what was ""cut"" -- and I still don't know!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Probably far better than it has any right to be, The Beast in the Cellar managed to keep me reasonably interested in its resolution despite manifestly poor production values (note of warning: the DVD transfer is of terrible quality) and thus can be sort-of recommended as being much less awful than it appeared it would be."
3,Lip sync?,"Is this real? I have the album to this DVD and strangely these titles all sound exactly the same. And no, I don't believe the album was made from this live recording. Anyway, I love watching it and if you consider buying it: it'll sure be money well spent. Good ole, no-nonsense rock 'n' roll. Pump up the volume and play that air guitar!"
5,BUY THIS CD!,"If you purchase one CD this year, make it Wynonna's ""New Day Dawning"". Disappointed fans of her last two forays into the studio (""Revelations"" & ""The Other Side"") will be THRILLED by this collection of fresh new country music, Wynonna style! The album blasts off with its first track (my fave), ""Goin' Nowhere"", an enjoyable, toe-tapping, knee-slapping good time. The transition between songs and tempo is an engineering masterpiece, culminating in the fabulous ""I Can't Wait To Meet You"", a funk-meets-gospel take on the Macy Gray hit, ""I Can't Wait to Meetcha"".All music fans will enjoy this album. It rivals Wynonna's solo debut as her best album...and indeed, this is the best country music album I have purchased in two years."
5,Wy fan,"""Lost Without you, ""Going Nowhere"" are two of the best songs on this cd. She puts all her heart and soul on the cd. It's one of her best ones yet, i been a Wy fan since the beginning of her career. She just keeps getting better & better!"
3,Not the Wynnona of yesterday!,"First I have to say. Wynnona has incredible voice. But anyone expecting to hear the Wynnona Judd will be disappointed. As her last 2 albums demonstrate, Wynnona continues to drift further and further away from her beginnings. I for one loved her ""country"" sound and long to hear it on occasion. It seems it is not to be. The single is the only real ballad and it is awesome but I was a little disappointed in the disjointedness of the album and maybe it is because of the musical selections. Even the 4 songs with Naomi that would have been a nice visit to the ""old days"" are completely the new Wynnona and why Naomi is on the cuts is a mystery...... Love the Voice just long for the good old days."
3,"Entertaining, but...","...it's a little bland, more than a little predictable. Don't get me wrong, I'm listening to it and enjoying it, but...the best I can say is that it won't offend your grandmother. Don't you want to be able to feel just a little more about a contemporary pop album?"
3,Disappointed,Upon removing book from envelope a rating very good condition showed corner of cover was fully bent over in envelope.
4,excellent raw pop,these guys are pretty much unheard to the listeners of 90's alternative music but the tvp's have been in influence on nirvana to pavemment. But the music is what counts. this is an album of early recordings. this is an exellent tvp album to start off with because aside from dont the kids.... this is pretty much pop all around except for some exceptions.it kicks off with 3 wishes and david hockneys diary which are comparable to any great pop songs of the 60's. king and country is a remake of the birds 8 miles which is right on par with the original. 1 or 2 throwaways but are easily made up with other great numbers like when emily cries and anxiety block. Any fan of pop music should make this purchase and hear another great band from the 80's(the replacements) cause its proof that 80's was'nt all hairspay and 15 minutes of fame. also prices run alittle high on the cds so one might try half.com since im sure not many will read this.
4,Industrial films done right,"The British Transport films were something one (as casual film history buffs) always heard about but never quite got around to seeing (either owing to difficulty finding them or because watching govt industrial films ""made right"" is not sexy.) This collection is a good cross section of the various offerings disc-ed up by British archives (usually found in VHS or PAL.) The range here is kinda narrow, avoiding the more dramatic transport stuff or the more rhythmic material also generated in that era. Check out Geoffrey Jones if you can.) But, these are industrial films that transcend the genre simply because they are detailed, professional and curious about the techne of the railroad system in such a way that they illuminate equally the rail road workings as well as the people around the industry. Captures a tone and age."
3,"Great feel, great look, but very annoying BEEP","This phone has a very ergonomic feel to it, and a very aesthetic look. However, the one annoying feature is that the BEEP it makes when pressing keys, or when turning the phone on/off is very loud: loud enough that I wouldn't want to use it near someone who was sleeping. Unfortunately, there's no way to adjust the volume, or turn off, this BEEP."
4,Generally OK,I have owned 3 of these phones for over 2 years. They were very reasonably priced and have worked OK for the time I have had them. Last week we had a power outage. After about 10 minutes I decided to phone a friend and found all three phones were dead. Something about the outage discharged them immediatly. This is not acceptable & even though they recharged I am now looking for new phones.
1,"Unusable, but perhaps so due to 802.11b wireless and apptmnt","The phone was unusable due to high static, yet it might be because of the number of wireless data networks around my appartment. And yes i did charge the battery for 24 hrs before use."
1,OUCH!! Pain with no gain.,"I haven't tried every manual breastpump for comparison, but I can tell you that the Medela Harmony I bought hurts like the dickens, and it isn't very successful in getting milk out of me - hand expressing worked equally well if not better. To avoid sinking more money into a device of torture I'll never use, I've rented a Medela Lactina from a local clinic in order to try an electric pump before making the investment in purchasing one. I'm WAY happier with it and would recommend it over a hand-pump any day. It is overkill for my pumping needs, but the comfort and effectiveness is worth the extra $$$ to me."
1,former medela user,"I first used the medela breast pump a fews years ago with my son. I was in the military and pumping milk was the only thing I could do. I am now expecting my third child and am reluctant to get a breast pump of any kind, because of the pain the medela caused. Though pumping was my only choice since I wanted desperately to breast feed, I am afraid of the unneccessary pain I'll have to endure from pumping. It's been years now since I pumped, so I'm hoping technology has changed a bit to help the mother with some relief. I've heard about the Isis, but my experiences with the medela really were painful. I also didn't express much more milk with the medela than I would when I pumped by hand into a cup."
3,Problem with suction,"I like this pump for the ease of cleaning and being able to take it anywhere with me to pump. It expresses milk fairly quickly, though I think the Medela mini-electric was much better. The only problem I have with this pump is the suction. It does not suction on the breast well, and milk leaks out the bottom of the cone while I'm pumping, getting my shirt wet. Just like a previous reviewer wrote...it works the best when I am engorged. I think Medela could have done a lot better with this part."
1,BAD!!!,This pump was cheap and I know why. It was way to hard to use and when you finally figured it out it took way to long and was way to hard to get anything. I would not recommend it to anyone. Finally went out and bought an electric one. Do not waste your money!
4,Nostalgia and Mothers,"Obviously if you are reading this you are interested in a CD saluting mothers. And for such an undertaking this is quite good. It is also quite a collection of some of the greatest talent of 80 or so years ago. To find Al Jolson, Arthur Tracy (the Street Singer), John McCormack, Sophie Tucker and Georgie Jessel on one CD is quite remarkable. And the jewel of this undertaking is Jessel singing his famous song My Mother's Eyes. For that alone this CD is worth the price! And in a note to Amazon, better fix your search mechanism. When you search for Mr. Jessel no recordings are displayed. Obviously this CD IS on the website."
3,Rip Roarin' Fun and Nuthin' More!,"For those about to rock... Electric Frankenstein salutes you!This combo must have been breastfed with their copies of ""Raw Power"" by Iggy and The Stooges holding their mother's milk. They destroy any pretext of a quiet evening at home... God bless 'em.The CD opens with the caution monolog re-read from Universal Pictures 1931 epic Frankenstein and never lets up. Pure PuNk explosions from every track with no time for a breather. Truthfully you can't help but get sucked into EF's pure rock view of their distorted yet cranked up, oversexed pandemonium universe.It's nothing new, but who cares? They do it well."
5,So Beautiful!,"The picture doesn't do this watch justice. I had my eye on this for a long time, and my husband recently surprised me with it.I absolutely love it!The blue color is so much more beautiful than it shows here, and the detail in the face, that's barely seen here, is amazing.When the light catches it, it just sparkles!The face has a nice thickness to it as well. I was worried it might be flimsy and too delicate... but it's not at all.The box this comes in is worth mentioning too; it presents very well. It's similar to a jewelry box and much bigger and heavier than you'd imagine for a watch. To receive this as a gift is just impressive all around.I know the apprehension of buying jewelry online, I've been disappointed before, but you will not be disappointed with this piece!"
4,Most of the songs on the CD are great!,Hank Jones is one of the greatest jazz musicians of our time.Most of the songs on this CD are welll done!Anything by Jones I recommend to all!David
2,Unimpressed,"I was overjoyed to find this series of books on history from the perspective of how lives were lived, only to be utterly disappointed.The essays were difficult to read and more difficult to understand. That I was reading translated text might very well have something to do with it, but it surely cannot account for all the bad features. Sentences were unnecessarily long and windy. The tone was often condescending, disdainful and occasionally sarcastic. At times the author made a claim and then offered to illustrate it with material that was disorganized and irrelevant.I read the first essay on the Roman Empire and my enthusiasm about the book was completely extinguished by the time I reached the chapter's end . I had hoped that the second essay, by a different author, would be an improvement. Well, it was not. And that was enough for me."
4,Elegant Prose,"This one is a set of stories chronicling Durrell's trials and tribulations with the zoo/conservatory that he built and managed for many years during his life. Although these are tales that narrate the life of a zoo-owner/keeper, Durrell brings to these narratives his excellent descriptions and his vivid sense of humor and detail. These are essential tales of various animals and their peculiarities -- the way that Durrell describes them, they seem to pop out of the book right into the room beside you. A short book, well worth a read."
3,"Very good, if a tad bit over-produced","This is a good Five-Eight album, just not their best. With this album the band had signed to a major label and adopted a different sound; consequently this was the last album with longtime drummer Tigger Ferguson who was replaced by Mike Rizzi.Overall some very solid tracks here and I would not hesitate to recommend to any fan of the band."
5,Children books author morphs into adult literature,"I still remember ""The Boogey Man"" by Arthur Crowley as my all-time favorite children's book. Crowley's latest masterpiece, ""Six Problems for Inspector Basehart, will surely entertain the hordes of his grown-up fans. Hope this is the first of many more to come!"
1,Don't Waste your $$$$$$$$ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't waste your time or money! This is by far the worst display product I have ever seen! Terrible very very cheap product. Look somewhere else for a 1 piece tube, this is 4 cheap plastic pieces to try and hold together and the ends you put on to hold the bat doesn't let the black ends to hold the whole contraption together, Ugh! Just forget it and don't spend your money!!!"
2,DISPLAY,One word JUNK! I have nothing more to say about this item so I am just typing to finish the amount of required words for review.
5,Lovely,"Abigail Adams was a lady far ahead of her times. While she never thought women should run the most important things, she did feel that everyone should have certain rights-thoughts shared with her friend Thomas Jefferson. Bober does a wonderful job of showing the pain of separation Adams felt, her wanting for her husband of sons, and the sorrow she felt as all those she loved slowly passed away. But through it all, Abbey was willing to sacrifice it all for her country. Abbey should stand as a role model for us all."
4,It was a great book for someone who believes in freedom!,"I think the book was very interesting. It told you all about her life,accomplishments,fears,and goals. I think you should read this book because it was interesting and exciting."
1,Do NOT read this book,"This book did not have a purpose, Abigail Adams had no significant contributions to American society.Though she was a hard diligent worker the biography wasn't as captivating as I expected. If you are going to read this book you may as well reaed a biography on John Adams instead. This book really did not have much value to it."
3,Holds my ipad while charging,The only thing I wish this file pocket had was pre-drilled holes in the outside edge to allow for more fasteners to be installed.
2,"Poor ""Fake Stereo"" Sound Quality","This is the great original cast recording of Cole Porter's Broadway show, first released by RCA Victor in 1955 as LOC-1016 with very good mono sound. Unfortunately, this particular import CD has been mastered in horribly severe ""fake"" stereo, and is muffled and blurred as well. I don't know if the other competing versions of this same mono recording sound better, but let's hope so."
2,Bad quality,"Although the six paintings are all famous ones, the quality is really bad. You can make better one by print yourself.."
5,Sublime... honestly.,"When you've played this CD through the first time you might find yourself with a mixture of elation and sadness. Sad only that it is so unique and perfect and there's not another ten albums to buy exactly like this one. The elation comes from the sublime being brought so near. That might sound overly poetic, but the music here is inspiring for the mind, and luscious for the soul, and the sense of accord you'll feel is worth far more than five measly stars I can give it for Amazon."
3,Introspective Bensusan,"I have been a fan of Pierre Bensusan for many years and would rate his previous CDs among my most prized. This release is much more mello and introspective than his earlier works. I have listened to this CD for about a month now, and I find less that holds my attention in this CD as compared to his other CDs. Granted, the execution is heartfelt and at a high level of virtuosity, but in my opinion, much of the CD sounds like improvisational background music. If you are already a fan of Pierre, you will find this to be an interesting work in terms of his development. However, I much preferred the energy and life of his earlier works."
5,Wondrous Listening,"My fave Pierre album and I feel his best work...of course there are other fantastic tunes on his other albums such as Wu Wei,Santa Monica, Nice Feeling and his interpretations of trad folk like Sheebeg an Sheemor. But this album seems to have a cohesive quality, perhaps because it is all instrumental. Standouts are: L'alchimiste, Le jardin d'Adonis, So Long Michael. But it's all good. Nice artwork on cover. Thanks, Pierre for many hours of wondrous listening."
1,Guitarman,"DADGAD? Egad. Enough is enough. I'm happy that Pierre has learned to play in an alternate tuning but is that all he can do? The songs begin to run together and become hardly distinguishable. Hardly a true artist, I would suggest that Pierre go take some lessons to broden his scope."
2,Disappointed,"I own a business and have several acrylic wall files that are very sturdy. When I ordered these, I expected they would be similar quality. These are very flimsy (in comparison to other acrylic products). I do not expect they will hold up with the wear and tear they will experience in a normal office."
2,Rituals for celebrating life,"Somewhat disappointed with the overabundance of examples that overpowered balance with recommended points covering how to write an eulogy. Some of the points could be extracted from the extensive examples. At the time of mourning and of preparations for ceremonies and interment, one needs less counseling, fewer examples, and more facts on how to do. This book seems to be sort of an autobiography of the ministerial work of the author."
1,"bought for class, never opened it","I opened this book, read the first word, and was sleeping. I have no idea what its about, maybe something related to the class about indian stereotyping that I took and learned nothing in, but I really have no reason to write a review for it?"
1,Make your bulky Treo even bulkier,"It seems amazing that no one can produce a slim case with a simple belt clip. Most start by ""designing"" a big chunk of plastic (like this model) then affix an even bigger belt clip to it. As you can see from the photo, the clip is as thick as the Treo itself, which can hardly be considered slim by today's standards. So if you want to look like a total geek/nerd with a giant Treo extending 2-3 inches from your waist, this is definitely the clip for you. It's worse than nothing at all. It can even entangle itself in your car's seat belt. The only good thing about this model is that it's no worse than its competitors. What a deal!"
1,Poor Contruction,"I've had two of these clips in the last 10 month. Both of them were broken. I also dropped my phone no less than 6-7 times.The problem with this clip is the plastic clip. Treo is actually pretty big. When you sit down, it is pushed out, which causes the plastic clip to crack.Unfortunately, I don't see any other clips that are as convenient as this one. I might have to get the third one."
5,"Great shower valve, nice smaller escutcheon plate","This valve works very smoothly and has a great look for a period bath. The rectangular escutcheon plate has a smaller top to bottom profile than the round ones on other models, which was what I needed."
5,great product,I have couple of sd memory cards and they all work great with this product..Worth to buy..
3,christening bib,BabyBjorn Bib for Baby Carrierthis is a bib for a baby's christening day....beautiful white satin bib
4,Fun history of the world's (c)oldest profession in AK,"I bought this book at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks bookstore. My dad, Class of '51 at UAF (we were there for his 50th reunion), had told me some stories about ""The Line"" and he had had his first job with the gold mining operations, so I was curious. There's not a lot of gory detail here. It's about people and places, but it's quite a colorful history. Though never officially legal, prostitution was tolerated and it flourished in Alaska for more than 50 years. And some very famous characters pop up, like Wyatt Earp and the ""Birdman of Alcatraz"". Definitely worth the time."
2,Well researched,"I had to read this for a book club and didn't make it all the way through. I will give credit for a well researched book. It is a history of endless short accounts of the miners and the women who serviced them. While there are a few interesting characters, the information was limited and left you wanting to know more of the story.This will be of interest of someone who studies the history or who has visited Alaska and seen the locales of the stories to make a connection."
3,Good Time Girls gives a pretty good time.....,The story of the women who ventured north to Alaska during the gold rush is a great story. However this account is a bit rambling and lacks continuity from one chapter to the next. There are several misspelled words and grammatical errors (no spell check or grammar check???). Overall...a good account of the spirited 'working women' who joined the rush to the gold.
2,Not Real Interesting,"I was disappointed in this book, it seemed more like a history of the men of the Yukon and Gold Rush . There were some stories about some of these women in there, but they were not very interesting to me, just sort of dry and lacking the quality that you could see and picture the people-which is a quality I look for in books of a historical nature. If you like just a history of cut and dry facts about the Gold Rush and the men etc., this might be ok, but overall, the book failed to be interesting to me."
3,Good Time Girls,Good book to get a real feel and facts for the life of the ladies of the evening in early Alaska
1,Is this Denver? No. Is this story historically accurate? No.,"I was excited to read a western starring a Secret Service agent, not cowboys or Texas Rangers -- especially since it takes place in my city. But the author ignores Denver's history and geography altogether. The story is set in 1887. Denver was founded in 1858, suffered from several natural disasters in the 1860s, and got a railroad spur in 1870. Colorado became a state in 1876, just before a silver boom brought even more wealth to the new capitol. Yet Ed Gorman ignores all this. He only describes a boomtown with sprawling slums where the state capitol now stands!?! The hero, Dev, spends more time remembering his pre-war crimes than following clues to find the counterfeiter's printing press. Worse, every woman in this non-historic story wears jeans instead of dresses with wide bustles! No wonder Dev thinks more about women than counterfeiters!"
5,"Drums, Drums, Drums",The video was everything I expected and more. The price was right and it was delivered in about 4 days. You simply can't beat that kind of customer service.
1,Cd jumps,The cd jumps and there isn't clear picture. Very annoyingI tried it on 2 DVDsComputerLaptopNothing is working
5,If your new to drumming....,This DVD is absolutely wonderful if your new to drumming. It will get you going right away and have you wishing for more.
5,Awesome!,"The dvd was easy to follow. It keeps your interest, and you learn so much! It is as good as having a teacher right beside you. I recommend this dvd for anyone who has even a remote interest in playing the drums. Tommy Igoe is an Awesome teacher!"
5,"Excellent, excellent -- and fun!","I'm just getting started with seriously looking at the drums, after learning from friends while I was in a band (I'm a guitar player). I got this DVD and I am extremely surprised and happy. Tommy Igoe shows you absolutely everything -- from setting up your kit and identifying the drums, tuning, playing, etc. He throws in lots of helpful tips, and he's cool and patient throughout the entire process. Amazing!Most of the beginning is setting up your kit, so there may be sections you already know, but you can skip those, and this will still be an amazingly helpful and instructive video. Unless you're already pretty well familiar with your drums and your basic grooves, you can definitely benefit from this, I think. I certainly have! It has saved me a lot of time of trying to learn these things in some other way."
5,The ABQ is AOK,"This is my second favorite Alden album after the Jazz Collective CD, also on Concord. All the compositions except one are by Buck Clayton: that one (""Dickie's Dream"") along with ""C Minor Swing"" are the highlights of this consistently solid CD. Dan Barrett is a beautiful trombonist with great control, but everyone performs marvelously on this date. Highly recommended."
2,"Fun country designs, but...","This is one of the few recent quilt books that have disappointed me. The photos might have been a delightful feature in a magazine, but they don't adapt well as a how-to book with patterns. The designs have such a strong voice, that you'll have the author's personality in the quilt, and not yours, if you make one of these designs."
2,Is this really hardcore?,I downloaded one song from these guys and couldn't believe how people call these guys the best harcore band ever. This has to be the worst hardcaore band ever. TALK TO SLIPKNOT
4,good product - expensive shipping,"My only regret is the amount of money I had to spend to have items from this company shipped. Otherwise, very satisfied!"
1,The Da vinci Deception,"Erwin Lutzer merely wrote an essay on his opinions of ""The DaVinci Code"". He neither proved nor disproved anything. He offered no real proof of his opinions. It was a total waste of my reading time. I had done some outside reading on my own and learned more than what Lutzer had to say.I would recommend ""Breaking the DaVinci Code"" by Darrell Bock. He offers real information."
5,Excellent treatment of FACTS,"Lutzer's book is straightforward and easy to read. He points out all of the blatant lies and more subtle half-truths found in Dan Brown's book. People already opposed to true Christianity won't like this book because, through careful examination of the facts, it shows why the Bible is accurate and true. Lutzer demonstrates that what the Bible tells us about Jesus is much more based on fact than Dan Brown's work of fiction. I highly recommend it to anyone who is seeking answers to the questions raised by The DaVinci Code."
3,"Quick, Helpful Read","This handy little tract does a fairly nice job of debunking the novel. It's easy to read and hits some very important historical points people should understand before reading ""The Da Vinci Code"". In particular, the author pokes so many holes in the Gnostic gospels (upon which most of Dan Brown's bizarre speculations rest) that in the end they seem about as convincing as Swiss cheese. Lutzer,from the Moody Bible Institute, draws heavily from Catholic Tradition to make his case, so I applaud his ecumenical spirit."
5,Solid History versus Fiction,"Finally, a book which delves into real verifiable history and lays it up against Brown's fictional book.As a person who studies church history and early writings, I am very pleased with how Lutzer clears up the confusion generated by Brown's non-studied fictional book.I just wish Dan Brown had set his book in ""a far off land"" so that I wouldn't be confronted with people asking me, as a christian researcher, ""What do you think of the Da vinci code?"".Apart from the names, pretty much all the events in Dan's book are fiction.Fiction is fiction. Ancient history is history. One of these things is not like the other.Other books of interest may include ""I don't have enough faith to be an atheist"" by Norm Geisler."
4,Tumble Weeds,Great book. Very funny classic humor. The book was received in the as advertised condition and easily within the projected time of receipt.
2,"Never PNY anymore, worst help support , no help!!!","This is the worst company that creates video cards.Windows was rebooting every 10 minutes, it turned to be that the card needed a new Bios, which is not even written in the manuall how to do it.My advice is, if you are not pro with computers don't buy this card couse u might see some problems, and u will be on your own.No help from PNY!!Alos Overclocking was bad too, this card is not for oveclockeres!My ATI video Rodeon 1 was much better than this, in terms of quality!"
2,Wait only 64MB!,"This is good card I agree, but only 64MB and 500Mhz ddr!Rodeon 8500 runs at 550Mhz DDR memory and comes with 128MB memory.For the same price, the future games require more than 64MB the upcoming Doom 3 uses at least 80MB memory on video card!This card will be not good for DOOM 3 and other high quality games. Makes sure u invest your money in smart way. [money] is lots of money, and I don't think anycard is worth [money] for only 64MB.Right now Rodeon 8500 LE is for only [money] at Amazon with 128MB or regular 8500 for [money]."
3,For girlfriend No No,"Hi,This product looks better on photo rather than real :-)Get a real gold one if you want to present it for your girlfriend :-)"
2,Got fooled by the pic.,Its one sided and doesnt look as appealing as it does in the picture. Dont really know if it is really worth 30 bucks.
3,Funny busy show,"We just watched this video with my kids who are 11 and 13. They loved the Shakespeare DVD and are hugely into history. This one isn't as comical as the Shakespeare show, but still funny. The guy who vomits was missed. There seemed to me to be more ""randy"" humor in this one. Some of the humor points out our hipocrasy which makes for good conversation, but isn't as light as the Shakespeare version."
1,Poor production,This is a silly and poorly acted comedy. Barely a script and mostly seems ad libbed.
5,Soft soothing dog grooming tool,We have boxers and have been looking quite a while for a good grooming tool for them. This comfortable rubber grooming brush is working very well for them. Many brushes are irritating for their short hair but his works very well. And our dogs love it. We would recommend highly for short haired dogs!
2,Forget it!,This product is a joke compared to the Furminator. I was fooling around with it for 6 months and had enough - got the Furminator and I removed probably 30 times as much hair in 5 minutes.
1,Software doesn't work with cable,I received cable in timely order and then downloaded software from Samsung. The cable connects to the computer OK but will not connect to the c417 phone.
1,Isn't as promised,"After I receive this item and plugged it in for use, I plugged the cable in to my Samsung SCH-C417 phone (Samsung C417). Not only did it not work with the driver that he included, but it did not work AT ALL with ANY driver that I could find. If any of you can find one that DOES work with this cable, email me. I am disappointed by this product, and the fact that the vendor did lie in saying that it is for the SCH-C417. It is infact for the X497 or the X495; NOT the C417!"
1,terrrible.,this product is pretty much useless. it dosent do anything it says it does.! *****DONT BUY IT!!!*****
1,DONT BUY,this cable (while it will connect your phone to the computer) will not allow you to transfer any data from your phone to your computer. what i ended up having to do was buy a cable from samsung specifically meant for my phone
1,C417 will not work with USB,"There is NO software available that will work with a C417 phone on a USB cable. This product is cheap, but still a waste of money if you have a C417 phone. DON'T ORDER IT FOR THE C417. I give it one star because there's no option for -1."
1,Doesn't Work,It doesn't Work. I used it weekly for one month and mildew grew in the shower :0. Vinegar and water works better.
1,Noxious FUMES irritated my nose and throat!,"I've regularly used Dow Scrubbing Bubbles on my shower. While it never bothered me too much, I thought that product had strong fumes and probably wasn't safe for my health. So I switched to Seventh Generation Shower Cleaner.How shocked was I when the first time I used it I felt burning in my nose and the back of my throat. I spent the next hour coughing. And no, I DIDN'T inhale any of the mist. This product DEFINITELY has fumes and smells awful.Hoping it was a fluke (giving the product the benefit of the doubt, I hypothesized that it had released toxic chemicals that had built up in my shower), I tried the product again a week later. SAME result. 45 minutes after using this product, I was still trying to clear the irritation in my nose and throat.As bad as I THOUGHT Dow Scrubbing Bubbles was, that product NEVER had this effect on my health. Seventh Generation Shower Cleaner is definitely NOT recommended."
1,Not for cooking,"Received this as a gift from our wedding registry. Please do not be deceived by the text here--the pot comes with a tag that says ""For Decorative Purposes Only,"" while the description on the website says that it is suitable for cooking.It is definitely not suitable for cooking."
2,Tips over and no coating removal insturctions,"I ordered this pot for a friend and the item shows it sitting upright (in a pic with a white background...) but the pot tips over on the handle side even full of water. It was going to be used for cooking caramel and we don't want to run the risk of it tipping over with molten sugar in it. Also, another person mentioned that it contains instructions how to remove the non-food grade coating properly, but the only thing it had was a tag saying that it was coated in one. It looks nice though!"
4,I like copper,I did a little reserch and also test myself.Copper does energize the water and I use this sort of water container.And the bottom was not flat so I hammered it and it stands now.No big deal. And good price for solid copper
5,excellent!!,"The pan is outstanding!! Anyone who loves Zabaglione, the Italian dessert, can appreciate having the pan to make it properly."
4,Great protection,Really like my new Rhinoskin leather flipcase cover. nice quality and keeps my little MP3 very safe and protected. Comes with optional belt clip.Leslie
2,Very little useful information,"This is a collection of quoted writings by Lenin and his contemporaries. The author does give a paragraph summary here and there, but this is not useful for study of the Soviet Union. I want my 30 bucks back."
4,Lots of information but wordy,A little wordy and sometimes hard to find the main idea in each chapter. There is quite a bit of info in in the book.
3,clear lipstick holder,I really like this product. The only issue I have is that my MAC lipsticks cannot stand straight because of the bullet shape top. I don't want to have to lift the holder up in the air to see what color I want to where. Better suited for lipsticks with a straight or round flat base. Overall the item is cute. It arrived ontime.
4,Lipstick Girl,"It's a very nice holder - not too big and not too small. It fits any lipstick, lip gloss, chapstick, etc nicely. I love that I'm able to see what I have and not have to dig through a makeup bag anymore. I would highly recommend."
5,Pretty and handy,This is a very very nice Lipstick organizer. It is compact and looks great. All my lipsticks are now organized. Love it and planning to buy one more for my mom in India.
4,Better than I expected,I was very suprised about the quality of this lipstick organizer. It's a little heavy to not flop over and holds lipstick very nicely.
1,Too shallow!,"I was really looking forward to receiving this lipstick holder! However, when I put my lipsticks in the holders, they all fall over to the side (just as many other reviewers have reported.) I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews about this product. It is a great concept, but the sides of the holders need to be higher to prevent the lipsticks from falling over. I hate the hassle of returning an item, but I just can't see keeping this one as it serves no purpose."
4,Almost perfect!,"This caddy is almost perfect and just what I needed for all my lipsticks of various shapes. My octagon-shaped, square-shaped and rounded lipsticks all fit in here, although some of the non-round ones fit rather snugly. I would recommend this product--I am so glad I bought it! Oh, and it fits in my bathroom vanity drawer even with the lipsticks loaded in it!"
2,Much Smaller and Shallow,This item is much smaller than it appears. This deception was created with the reflective base used in the picture.
4,Great reading!,"All of the books written by these authors make for exciting reading. You get mystery,romance(in a morally acceptable way),adventure,and history of the location. They are exciting books that will keep you wanting to read the entire series to the end. I have found them to be much more entertaining and clean to read that watching any TV. You'll not be disappointed!"
4,not disappointing,As a surgeon and writer I am always on the hunt for a clever quote or historical vignette to supplement my writings. I find this book to be a treasure trove. It is a great reference and a fun read as well. I keep it handy on my desk.
3,its okay,"Very boring book and definitely not worth the price, but was a necessity to buy for school. Had no choice at that point."
5,"Peps, not Benny","I don't get the other reviewers who insist on Peps being a Goodman clone. Well was Bob Wilber one too? Did he sound like Peps? How about Johnny Mintz? I contend that this great album features a clarinetist doing his own thing and that the differences and contrasts between his playing and Goodman's are easily as important as the similarities. I hear Peps, not Goodman."
5,So far so good.,"Installed these to replace 15 year old shocks. People have said they are too firm, but I like the feel the give. Need to get a set for the fronts."
5,YSL AMAZ,purchased and received wrong. immediately notified the vendor and got tremendous understanding and service. reshipped correct item ASAP . Thank you
3,Why? Because he can!,"What's the punchline of that old joke? ""Why? Because he can!"" That's what came to mind when I first heard of David Cooper's interpretation of Bach's famous Suites for Solo Cello on the trumpet.Yes, the double and triple stops don't work out so well on the trumpet, but other than that the beautiful implied harmony that makes these pieces so famous still comes through. I've heard these pieces performed now on trumpet, viola, guitar, synthesizer, but still the cello versions sound best to me. We can argue about Casals vs. Ma vs. Rostropovich, but the cello does win out."
3,It isn't a horror movie...,"It is not a horror movie but rather more of a mild thriller with a love triangle. It was very slow in the beginning and took a while before anything moderately suspensefull happened. Also, the ""twists"" were somewhat redundant. Sarah does to them what they do to her. I don't want to give too much of the movie away incase anyone wants to watch it. The ""haunting"" in the title made it sound like a ghost movie to me but it is not."
5,Great book!,"My son (20 months) loves this book, as well as the whole Magic Castle Readers series. It teaches kids about emotions. Great book!"
4,A deeply entertaining and moral tale which reads like a thriller,"The atmosphere of New York in the early 90'ies; funny how that felt a little distant, like remembering an old friend. This is a very nice book, well written, with a set of engaging characters, and an interesting story. The story is not complicated, but well told, and the author makes you really care about the multi-faceted characters involved. Also, this author is a keen observer of the world around him. The detailed description of things, actions and motives are often a little unexpected, and often illuminating."
4,"Great for BG1 fans, newcomers may be less enthused","My husband and I loved BG1 and couldn't wait to get BG2. As has been said, this is more like an expansion of the last game. The previous storyling is referred to often and there are very few improvements or expansions on gameplay. One new addition is the ability to upgrade weapons with jewels, which my husband especially enjoys (it kind of reminds him of that capability in Grand Tourismo) and a world map that allows you to revisit different areas. Load/save times seem faster than BG1, graphics and gameplay are about the same. The enemies are par for the course (although what is up with the fighting furniture? It seems a bit silly). However, it's a great, fun, game with a 2-player cooperative mode (the main reason we bought it in the first place) and well worth the money."
4,Gamer's Delight,"Okay, so I may not be a hardcore gamer, but my husband is- he asked me to post a review for the game so that others might know how great it is. Kept his attention and definately stood up to the first game... for the price we paid, it was worth the deal... the graphix may not be all that anymore, but the story line of these two games makes up for the lack of pixels."
4,"Dear Sorry-to-disappoint,","I too subscribe to a couple of game magazines and bothof those rated Baldur's Gate 2 highly. Forthose fans who are awaiting the sequel, do not loosehope. The reviews are not so poor as the last reviewerhas indicated. On with the saga!"
2,great if you want mindless action,"This is basically a hack-n-slash game. You basically wind up figuring out the most effective attacks, then ignore beefing up any other special abilities. Some of the environments look pretty cool, though I realize I don't like games that show everything in top-down 3/4 perspective anymore (I think that's what they call it). But there is a lot of action. So if you like killing monsters for hours on end (I found it to be a longer game than one person pointed out. Longer than 12 hours IMO) you'll like this game. I think for this kind of game, Gauntlet Dark Legacy is WAY more fun. It's probably the same game length, definitely better graphics/perspective, more interesting level puzzles (Baldur's Gate has none really), and focuses on the abilities you need to kill monsters most effectively. There are no unnecessary abilities in that game. You can also play with a total of 4 people. BG is only for 1-2 players."
1,My game does not work :(,My game that I ordered does not work.My ps2 runs all of my other games but this one does not load.
2,Child Vesion of D&D,This game is reallly boring and there is nothing new or revolutionary about it. The spells are mediocore and the gameplay is hack & slash.Not a true RPG!
2,BGDA2 ROCKS!!!,This game is one of the best...by-far ive ever played in any genre...not only do you have the option of doing just about anything you want with the side quests and all...but you can customize your character completely.....not only can you just customize them ...but their weapons..their armor...EVERYTHINGawesome game....man....period.
1,ummm a lil heads up...,"just for all you parents anc christians who dont know, this game is Dungens and Dragons...you know that board game thats called all the deaths and demon possesions? yea i thought yall mite like to know. but for all of you who dont care, it was a fantastic game...easy and short. but awesome"
4,A bit better than the first,"Like my headline says, the only problems are little glitches and it sometimes gets too repetitive. It's also hard to switch to different spells. If they had added a few more innovations than I would have given this game five stars but they didn't add on to the game too much."
3,5 star game with a 1 star ending boss,I had a great time playing this game right up until the end. I ended up at 24th level with not much upgraded equipment due to rust monsters. Even worse I cannot go back to other areas and build my character up more so that I can be more powerful against the last boss now that I reached him. Why does every game writer decide that a game can be fun right up until the end where you must include a highly annoying hard to beat boss! You have to fight the same battle numerous times until you find the trick or get lucky enough to beat him. Actually I can't even beat the final boss with the invulnerability cheat turned on! I am looking for a game that is fun to play to the end!
4,rewarding for fans of bg1,".baldur's gate 1 was a solid game. breath.takingly short, but solid..bg2 doesn't screw w/ a working formula and adds just enough innovation to keep things fresh. more characters. more areas. custom gear. a pair of un.lockables. and praise.the.powers.that.be, more game.play..bg2 isn't ground.breaking. it doesn't have to be. you know what you are getting w/ bg2, and you aren't disappointed..this game may even rate on the purchase level. there is a great deal of content. yes, it can be painfully numbing, but there are enough save points in the game that whenever it becomes tedious you can simply save.n.go..very solid game. well worth a rental price, and perhaps containing enough content to make it a game you should consider purchasing."
3,Beware,"I rated this game as follows: the graphics are great, compared to the 1st one, the story line isn't too bad, but, on a scale of 1-10, the aggravation level leans towards a 7 or 8, due to the boss, Mordoc, is annoyingly impossible to harm. You think you have managed to inflict some damage on him, and he turns around and gains it all back. Until someone explains how in the world you can beat him the 2nd time, I'm putting thsi game to the side and playing something with less of an aggravation level, like Donkey Kong.I would still recommend it, though."
3,Hard to find,It's not near as much fun as the 1st one and was very difficult for me to find - Maybe that why lol
3,This game is only for those who were really into the 1st,"This game is basically an expansion to the first. The story continues directly after the first. The graphics are basically the same. There are five starting characters rather than three. There are new feats and spells your characters can use, and the armor is custom designed for each character when they wear it. The map is expanded but you will go to some of the same areas as the first. The number one problem is the monsters are the same. There are new monsters but most are the same and they are the same difficulty. I would give this game 5 stars as a fan of the first but as a gamer I can only give it 3."
4,"To new to know, but still sounds promising","Lets consider what is being said about this game: 80+hours of play. twice the levels, quests, and side quests(or more) of the first one. 5 characters, not 3. Animation that goes beyond the wonderful details and quality of the first. The ability to create new and powerful items and weapons, and use parts from the ones you find, or to buy parts.Play Magazine (Hey, I like to site my sources) has done a wonderful job covering it past issues, giving it a B+ on review (pretty high for them), and the reviews from other game magazines (Gamers, IGN, OPM) sound favorable too. Yeah, its going to be like the first one... its a sequel, set in the same place. HOWEVER, If you liked the first, and you know the first, dont worry... the second sounds like it is as good, if not better. (4 stars because the first one was good, and this one isnt released yet.)"
3,Only Average,"Baldurs Gate 2 is not a horrible game, but its not a great one either. It is almost exzactly like the first one, the only difference is the levels. More of an expansion than a sequel."
3,not as good as the first,"This one didn't have as good of a storyline as the first. It didn't seem to be as hard as the first one either. It felt to me that it didn't expand very far level wise. The graphics were awsome and being able to customize weapons was great. But, you are not able to get weapons that do as much as 120&140 except on a critical hit. Being able to pick from five characters instead of three was a plus. Over all it just wasn't as good as the first."
3,Not As Good As The 1st!,"I would have to say that I was somewhat disapointed with this sequel to a great game. I was not that impressed with the graphics or the gameplay. The gameplay was your standard hack and slash fare, nothing outstanding there. I didn't like the lack of choice with the characters available ie. you can't pick a race or a class that you want. If you pick the female drow, she MUST be a monk, and she can't be anything else. I had more options in Champions of Norath which I must say is a far better game. Also the last boss Mordoc is nearly impossible to defeat depending on which character you pick. It's a good idea to rent this game first before purchasing it."
2,noisy fan; entire unit failed after one year,"XM Radio's classical stations contain quite a few annoying ""house ads"" promoting their service, classical music in general, etc. They apparently don't have much of a budget for creating new ads so if you listen to XM Radio as background music you'll hear the same 30- and 60-second spots hundreds of times. It gets annoying.Fortunately my Sony receiver failed after a year so I was able to cancel the XM service. Before it failed I found that its cooling fan made a lot of noise and that XM customer service was terrible."
5,"A wonderful set, especially for the price","This collection is a great way to get a jump start on some of the greatest music of all time. You would have to spend a lot more to get individual cds with so many songs on them. Only two cds out of the ten have sixteen tracks, the rest have up to twenty one! Very enjoyable."
5,A book for everyone,"Brennan's subject is much larger than the aftermath of the tragedy that happened to her daughter. Is her daughter a different person because of her brain injury? Is Brennan, now, becoming a different person because of the way her relationship to her daughter is changing? Brennan worries questions of identity, personality, and the significance of memory with an astonishingly light touch, and she tells a terrific story. You could almost say that Brennan has made good somehow of the tragedy, turned her daughter into an inspiring lesson for all of us--except that Brennan is too smart and too observant of life to be that reductive. Her Rachel is no lesson; she's a treasure and a pain and a person-and-a-half. An often funny, heartening, and inspiring book."
5,Memory Gain,"Honest as it is graceful, lucid as it is lovely. Brennan's book deals with the shades of loss and reconciliation inherent in the land of the ""mind"" where identity and the ""self"" that we love when we love a daughter, sister, friend is housed and jeopardized on that accidental and foreign map of the brain trauma, coma, and finally memory loss(es) and gains. Being with Rachel visits that daughter, sister, friend, collaborative relationship that walks and tells and re-tells those stories, shared and re-made, until finally, there are paths carved well-enough that two--mothers, daughters, sisters, friends might walk together. A wonderful read."
4,Very interesting,A very interesting memoir. I thought the blend of medical and personal was very good. The author (Rachel's Mom) wrote a very moving memoir.
3,Ummmmm......interesting?,"Like I said in the title this album is an interesting listen. I would recommend it for big Pulp fans but I is quite hard to get into. There are some amazing songs it but the other songs are pretty bad. ""Being Followed Home"" ""I Want You"" ""They Suffocate At Night"" ""Life Must Be So Wonderful"" are all really good. ""Master Of The Universe"" ""Fairgound"" are OK the rest is pretty boring. Overall I do recommend it."
2,An extra star because it IS pulp,"Oooh, how should I put this. I mean it is pulp, that much is clear, but it definitely is not the ""It"", ""His 'n Hers"", ""Different Class"", ""This is Hardcore"" pulp we know and love. It is even relatively recently recorded. So, what happened? I mean, there's even some spoken word poetry in here. A big warning: only for the hardest of hardcore fans. I love pulp, but this is better for a good laugh than anyhting else for me."
1,Too lightweight,"It is definately light, soft and cushy but it is so lightweight that no matter how you position it, it slips away from your head. Needs to either be heavier or have tabs that button the ends around your neck."
2,return policy,"I ordered this item before Christmas for my husband. The item came quickly. I husband had wanted a pillow for travel and opened it at a family gathering. You need to read the return policy on this item before you decide to order. We needed tohave returned this item 15 days from delivery to receive a refund. My husband didn't decide till later that it wasn't what he wanted and although unused in the box we cannot return this item. I informed the company I would not have ordered from themif I had known their policy. With this item being a gift, it made it impossible to know within the 15 days of delivery if the item was what he wanted. I will not order from this company again."
2,travel pillow,"This travel pillow is far smaller than advertised. I would have returned it, but the cost of shipping it back was 1/2 the price of the pillow. So I kept it. I will give it to a child for a gift. It is definitely not suitable for an adult."
5,What fun!,"As a devoted mystery reader, I approach new mystery writers with some trepidation but this new writer is good! The book is filled with quirky characters patterned after old movie stars and the plot hints at old movie plots and settings as well as current TV news gathering. I had a good time reading this book and recommend it to others."
3,My First Elvis Movie,"This was the first Elvis movie I ever saw. It's definitely not the way to start out watching Elvis' movies, but it is an honest effort. You have to give it credit for having a different setting (in Europe) and for having a different type of plot than other Elvis movies.It has a basically good soundtrack,""Baby,If You'll Give Me All Your Love"",""City By Night"",""Long-legged Girl"",""There's So Much World To See"",""Could I Fall In Love"",""I Love Only One Girl"",and ""Double Trouble"" are all good, with the exception of ""Old MacDonald"". I wouldn't say it was a ""horrid rendition"", but just the fact that this song is sung, period, makes it beyond ridiculous. I like, however, the fairly engaging plot, kind of a spy-spoof at times. John Williams, Annette Day,and Leon Askin stand out among the cast. Not highly recommended, but recommended nonetheless."
3,One of the Better Elvis Musicals,"Though it doesn't reach the musical-comedy heights of ""Viva Las Vegas,"" Elvis Presley's ""Double Trouble"" (1967) remains among his better efforts. Despite a shaky start, the film is fairly enjoyable with a refreshing change of locale: the MGM backlots of Europe. Elvis doesn't sleepwalk through the proceedings, showing his adept flair for comedy. There are a few memorable songs (notably ""Long Legged Girl"") and the supporting cast is quite good. No classic, but a decided improvement over ""Spinout"" and ""Kissin' Cousins."""
3,One and the Same,There is one song in this movie that Elvis does that reminds me a little of his start as a singer; Trouble. I like how he starts out in a deep tone and then sings like he did in the 50's and returns to the way the song started. This song has a comical side to it because of how it comes across.
4,I am the only one?,"I feel as if I'm the only that a good time with this Elvis Presley film. If you want to see a worst Elvis Presley film, then check out Harum Scarum. There are nine songs in this film not 2. And I own both films. I own this and Harum Scarum. But Elvis Presley didn't have a choice, his manger/agent decided that instead of performing concerts. I like this better than Harum Scraum and worth giving this above 3 stars. But I would have given this 5 stars if they would have gotten somebody who had more than one or 2 film playing Elvis Presley's love in the film. As the movie opens, when Guy Lambert (Elvis Presley) heads off to Europe, little does he know that his tour will include stops aong the way with spies, counterspies, jewel thives, and two lovely foreign feemes, (newcomer Annette Day and Yvonne Romain). If you don't like this, then move out of the United States."
3,Buy it for the music,"The movie really isn't that great. However, I bought this tape because the CD is so out-of-print that the only way I could get this music was to buy the Movie. There are a couple of good songs like ""Long Legged Girl"" and ""City at Night"", which is an extremely difficult song to find."
1,Not worth the trouble,"Set in 'Swinging London', and fashionable European locales, (courtesy of the Hollywood back-lot) this film must surely have convinced even the die-hard fan that Elvis was well and truly performing in a parallel universe. The laughable attempt to give it a more ""mod"" look was embarrassing given the trite songs (""I Love Only One Girl"" and ""Old MacDonald"") and cornball premise.Elvis seemed to be trying to inject some sense of balance into the film by not taking it too seriously, and for this reason alone the film is not a complete failure. But, given the fact that this is the same Elvis Presley who shone in ""Flaming Star"", ""Viva Las Vegas"", and ""King Creole"", and who turned the world on its musical, and social, ear ten years earlier, maybe it was just pure boredom or embarrassment that infused his performance."
5,Double Trouble,"Just one of many terrific movies by Elvis. Not quite in the same scheme of things as the others, just a little twist. Would recommend it to any Elvis fan, or anyone at all."
1,One of Elvis' worst movies,"I've seen all of Elvis' movies, most several times. This is one of the worst. Only Stay Away Joe and Harem Scarem are worse. I usually watch every Elvis movie every time it comes on TV, but not these three."
2,Very basic,"This is the type of bare-bones video I remember snoozing through in junior high social studies class. If you know nothing whatsoever about Korea, this video would serve as a simple albeit dated introduction to the country and its major cities and regions. Because this was produced shortly after the 1988 Summer Olympics, it imparts the message that Korea has more pride in its Olympic athletic complex than its own historical culture. Please don't be fooled. If you are looking for any level of cultural enrichment, this is not your solution. Instead take a look at the PBS video ""Hidden Korea."""
2,Basic review,The book was too basic and gives novices enough information to hurt themselves in the real market.
4,A Must Book for the Beginning Options Trader,"As someone who has been trading options for a couple of years, mainly has a hedge against adverse price moves in stocks, I wanted to try my hand at a more aggressive strategy, using options to make money, and possibly become wealthy. I knew that a thorough understanding of volatility was necessary for options trading. I was drawn to this book because I had previously bought the Options Course from George Fontanills and thoroughly enjoyed it.The Volatility Course has two themes: Understanding volatility and integrating volatility into your options strategies. There isn't a lot of theory to bog the options trader down but good examples to bring home his points. While I may have wanted to see a little more theory for handling the futures market, the book is excellent and would recommend it for the beginning options trader."
4,Outstanding!,This book is outstanding!Fix a few editorial errors and I will give it 5 stars.Great job!
4,absoulututly hilarious!!!,"this was a very good movie. it was funny, it had a good plot, and the actors were great! jim carrey and courtney cox were great together. the only thing i didn't like was the acting of dan marino. i guess if it were his third or fourth movie it would be an awful job of acting. but since it was his first movie he did an ok job. maybe directors thought he did an awful job and thats why he hasn't played in a movie until 1998,( Holy Man). but otherwise it was a great movie."
5,A FINE EXAMPLE OF TALENTED COMEDY,"A very good film which sustains a good story line whilst maintaining a varied amount of comedy, action and talented acting. Although thought of as a daft person with a face of putty, he shows skill in his actions and speech presentations."
1,Why is the 2nd movie in Widescreen and this one not?,"Great movie but HORRIBLE DVD!!!!!!!!No deleted scenes, Full screen, Only couple special feats, and it seems more like a VHS than a DVD.I will write a positive review once it's re-released in wide screen... and has that deleted scene where Ace rocks the Cannibal Corpse concert!"
2,"Good movie, bad DVD","Just a warning to everyone that buys this version of the DVD, it's fullscreen and doesn't have any special features. Now if you've seen the scenes that weren't included in the extended VHS, but were for some reason on the cable version, you'd see that they were among some of the funniest in the movie. I'd really like to see this one get maybe a double DVD release with When Nature Calls, souped up and some of those great missing scenes including Ace singing onstage with Cannibal Corpse (funniest scene in the whole movie I thought), Ace conversing with a few drunks in Ray Finkle's hometown and some others."
2,not that good,It was a good movie but the jokes were not that good and the story was messed up. It would have been worse but Jim Carry is hilarious. His other movies are better.
4,Classic,"This movie is a classic..for my generation. Jim Carrey is a funny man, and will do anything for a laugh. I received the movie in new condition and in a timely manner. It made a great present for my boyfriend."
3,The Fox,This is the movie that put Jim Carrey on the map. His crazy antics will keep you glued to the screen. Courtny Cox Arquette also does a good job as the stuck up love interest. Pick up your copy today. Also Dan Marino shows he has true grit and Tone Loc keeps it real.
5,GREAT!,"Funniest movie ever! It's better than the second, and features some classic Carrey humour.A MUST FOR ALL FANS OF COMEDY!"
2,"JIM CARREY, BAD ACTOR","This is about the only movie of Jim Carrey's that I found even the slightest bit funny. The scene where the theme from Crying Game starts to play was brilliant, but only because the Crying Game movie left a strong impression. Why this made so much money I'll never know."
1,Just isn't Funny!,...I remember just hating it . It was so stupit every part was overdone and the movie is very immature and worst of all Jim Carrey gave me a headache I really did not get the humor in the movie....
3,NOTHIN SPECIAL.,"I must admitt Jim Carry is one of my favorite actors, But I was disapointed with this movie. Jim carry is a great physical comedian,and I think this role fitts him just right. But sometimes it can get a little old. In my mind Jim Carry was over acting. In certain points of the movie I would occasioally chuckle, but the plot made no scence. Bottom line, OK movie. bye."
1,Doesn't even deserve one star,"but they did manage to get the movie onto the screen so we'll give them credit for that. This movie is nothing more than innane - less than that - moronic. If you have to have your brain extracted and wish to be entertained while recovering, watch this movie."
1,"Another GREAT Movie, but a HORRIBLE DVD!!!!","Again, this is another movie that I love, and it should get five stars all the way. but.......IT'S FULLSCREEN!!!! What's the big deal??! I mean, yeah it's a comedy and widescreen shouldn't matter that much, it's just that when the VAST majority of DVDs features widescreen versions...well, ya get kinda spoiled. It's nothing that you mean to have happen...it just does.I will write a positive review when this is re-released in WIDESCREEN. Again, my LASERDISK is widescreen. I don't care about the special features, just give me the widescreen, please. If I wanted fullscreen, I'd watch the VHS version, thank you very much."
5,Mr. Shickadance Gets Revenge!,"Watching Ace Ventura Pet Detective again! Must see Mr. Shickadance (Mark Margolis) who until recently starred in ""Breaking Bad"" as the stroke-ridden, wheel-chair bound cartel thug. I say until recently 'cause he just got revenge againt Mr. Chicken (with help from Walt, of course). Cool! Fun to see actors in their other roles throughout the years."
5,Another Childhood Favorite!!!,"Ever since I was a kid, I've loved this movie because of Jim Carrey's wacky and silly behavior. Ace Ventura is a Pet Detective who is hired by people to reunite lost or stolen pets with their owners. When Snowflake, the mascot of the Miami Dolphins is kinapped two weeks before the Super Bowl. Ace is hired to find Snowflake and find whoever kidnapped him before the Super Bowl. If you love comedy, you'll love ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE!!!"
5,Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"He's the best there is. In fact, he's the only one there is, He's Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Ace is on the case to find the Miami Dolphins' missing mascot and quarterback Dan Marino. He goes eyeball to eyeball with a man-eating shark, stakes out the Miami Dolphins and woos and wows the ladies. Whether he's undercover, under fire or underwater, he always gets his man or beast. Jim Carrey is quite simply amazing, I never stopped laughing the whole way through the movie. Sure-fire entertainment."
3,"So ""no"" to full screen (standard)",I thought this movie was REALLY funny. It seems like this was his greatest at goofyness. Just funny enough with out over doing it. I would also give it 4 or 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that it is (currently) only available in DVD standard full screen format.
4,When is a widescreen DVD going to be available?,"Ace Ventura Pet Detective is one of the funniest comedy movies I have ever watched and stars two of my favorite actors, Jim Carey and Courteney Cox, I wanted to replace my full screen video to DVD but since the DVD is not available in widescreen but only an edited to fit your television full screen I just don't see the point of replacing it right now when it will just be the same as the video, it's truly a wonderful hilarious belly buster but I will wait until a widescreen DVD is made available or a DVD that includes both a widescreen and full screen version and I would like to know why the sequel When Nature Calls which is not as funny as Pet Detective is available in a DVD that includes the choice of both widescreen and full screen and not Pet Detective which is the first movie in the series? So until than I will just stick with my video."
1,NOT EVEN FULL MOVIE,"This is not even the full movie. This seems to be an edited, TV version. It's missing several scenes that add to the hilarity. I have watched this movie on VHS a hundred times and this stream is shit!"
4,Very Funny,"This was an earlier Jim Carrey movie, and I have to say, it's definitely hilarious in some parts. It isn't the best Jim Carrey movie I've seen (it's close though). The DVD is OK in the features but the movie itself is worth owning. If you want a good time or just want to laugh it up this is the movie for you."
1,Makes me nauseous,"This is, without question, the most trans-phobic movie I've ever watched, not to mention seriously twisted in relation to women. What the hell kind of police force just sits and watches as a lunatic strips one of their detectives ""to prove he's innocent""?"
3,Poor quality,There was a big gash in the back despite being wrapped in bubble wrap and there were some indents on the cover.
5,So funny!,"This is one of the rare movies that makes me laugh no matter how many times I see it. I like Jim, but I LOVE him in this movie. It's the one that made him a star, and he really deserved it."
4,Jim Carrey's Fan must!!!,"If you are a loyal fan of Jim Carrey, you must own this movie. The adventure begins with laughter and it goes deeper. Do not expect Drama....Carrey's expressions say it all. His car is an old badly kept coupe....but it runs. He solves crime and ends up getting recognition. I bet that we all would love to be him at one point. I would recommend for ages 14 and up. If you are a fan of Robim Williams this movie may also appeal to you. If instead you like Al Pacino's humor...do not buy or attempt to buy this one."
4,Ace Ventura Pet Detective(1994),"Ace Ventura Pet Detective(1994) was a surprise hit in early 1994. Jim Carrey(In Living Color) plays Ace Ventura, a ""pet detective"" who searches for a missing dolphin. Courteney Cox plays Melissa and Dan Marino plays himself in a work of fiction. Sean Young and Tone Loc co-star. The NBC version of this film restored many deleted scenes. Jim Carrey is one of the film's strongest saving graces. He's so funny with his rubbery brand of humor. In the script, Ace Ventura was described as nerdy, nebbish, and clumsy. Jim Carrey made Ace Ventura more cool and suave. Ira Newborn's music score has a ""Henry Mancini influence"".Ace Ventura Pet Detective spoofs 1992's The Crying Game. The film was also criticized for portraying transexual people in a negative way. Still, the film has some solid action scenes and laugh out loud moments. Ace Ventura Pet Detective is a must see for Jim Carrey fans."
4,An instant classic of Jim.,A hilarious movie from begginning to end. A great movie when your looking for a laugh.
4,"Great flick, okay DVD","This movie has become a cult classic, a smash hit on it's release, and the character ""Ace Ventura"" now a pop icon. It will be interesting to see if he is still recognized in 2015.Jim Carrey stars as Ace Ventura, with Courtney Cox as the leading lady, Sean Young as the villiam, and Dan Marino in his biggest acting role to date.If nothing else, this movie is a joy to Marino fans.Aside from that, this is Jim Carrey's breakthrough role, and quite a hilarious film. The only dissapointment is the lack of DVD features. There is feature commentary by director Tom Shadyac, but there were sooo many scenes shot for this movie that didn't make the final cut, it would have been really nice to see them included as special features in this movie. Alas, it doesn't look like another edition will be coming out anytime soon, and this movie is well worth your money anyways."
3,Funny Movie; So-So DVD,"The movie is a comedic classic now. Jim Carrey's exaggerated physical comedy is great, and the story of ""Ace Ventura"" is a perfect fit for those talents. I laugh a lot when I watch this movie. Ok, 'nuf said about the movie itself.The DVD is sparse on features. The traditional ""Special Features"" section actually doesn't have any special features. It's just a few lines of text, blurbing nothing really interesting. There's the also the traditional commentary audio track, and subtitles in English and French. Oh, and the Trailers for both Ace movies. That's pretty much everything on the DVD.I'm the kind of person that doesn't really care about a DVD being loaded with special features, and even I was disappointed by this DVD."
1,The Movie is Awesome but the DVD is the Pits!,I love this movie but why did they not put a widescreen option on the DVD instead of just fullframe?The sequel got widescreen so please do a widesceen DVD for this movie!
4,Sometimes I hurt from laughter,"This movie is side-splitting. Jim Carrey's comedic timing is right on the eccentric yet somehow brilliant Ace Ventura. You just can't help but love his disguise for the mental institution; he fits right in!Unfortunately, the DVD is a little bland, with not much to offer over the director's commentary. No deleted scenes, or any of the fun stuff. But hey, I bought it just for the pure pleasure of repeated viewings.I would reccommend this film to anyone with a sense of humor."
4,Jim Carrey's best performance,Ace Ventura is an absolutely hillarious comedy in which Ace Ventura is a pet detective. When someone steals the Miami Dolphins dolphin (snowflake) He gets hired to find snowflake. With this kind of story along with Jim Carrey as Ace Ventura it's certainly one of the funniest movies ever.
3,It's ok.,"This book has great explanation of each sign in part two. It's really not what I expected though, and has a creationist backbone which kinda turned me off."
1,Poorly organized and written,"I found this book poorly organized and written. I have deleted it from my Kindle, and I would not suggest it to my students."
2,Modern books beat this one,"Modern books on this subject, which I approached from the point of view of a student of witchcraft, have more to say, better phrasing, more complete information ... I ended up wanting to throw this across the room. Since I got it on Kindle, I didn't. But it has no information not easily duplicated by others. Kindle books don't precisely take up space on your bookshelf, and it's a free Kindle at that. So help yourself, but don't expect to be very pleased by this tome unless you're an archaeologist."
2,Just could not get into it,"Overall its OK but there are several other albums that should be considered first, see my other reviews for suggestions."
5,Faboulous Intrigue in a New York State of Mind,"I love books set in New York and this is one of the best I have read. There is plenty to follow along and guess what's coming next, the budding relationship is also well writen."
1,Missing Spoon Rest,"I ordered two sets of the 3-piece stove top set. Both sets came without the spoonrest. I have email Mega China with no response. I would love to order again from them but not if I don't received what I ordered. Also, the shaker were so dusty...on a shelf for many months."
5,"Great, as usual","As usual, Fiestaware does not disapoint. The bright color and heavy weight make these a nice quality. Also, the large grip handles on the shakers fit even my husband's large hands. I would highly recommend."
2,Disappointing effort from one of my favourite bands.,"I'm not sure why, but this album doesn't do anything for me. The guitar sound is non existent, the lyrics are trite. The title track almost saves it, as the finale of the 10 minute song is magnificent. But unfortunately what precedes is decidedly average from a band who can do much better."
4,A great follow up building on the Afraid of Sunlight sound.,"This Strange Engine (TSE) finds Marillion farther down the road begun with Afraid of Sunlight (AOS). Steve Hogarth's influence (judging by his solo album ""H"") has been more integrated into the Marillion sound. Production is similar to AOS, but without the lulls present in that album. TSE is an encouraging sign of things to come."
4,One of the very good album with Steve Hoggart on vocals,"I like this cd a lot, it is a very good one and it for sure in the top five done with Steve Hoggart on vocals. The music is intense and the voice is very emotionnal. A good addition to my cd collection.My top five of Marillion with Steve H. on vocal would be ""Brave"", ""Seansons End"", ""Holidays in Eden"", ""Afraid of Sunlight"" and ""This Strange Engine""."
3,Poor description details in AD - returned.,No where in description (that I saw) provides the ID info. Just received the item only to discover that it's not compatible with connectors that I had purchased in July - and that I cannot now return. Let the 'free' shipping sway my judgement. My bad. Will return it and order another roll - from a different dealer whose ads provide inside diameter measurements.
4,Saves water,Have not used yet but have used similar in past. Great way to save water and ensure plants are fed. Item arrived quickly and was well priced.
1,Disappointed,I will not do that again. Freight cost was way too much and it took forever to arrive.I thought paying 3 times more than the product cost would result in quick delivery....WRONG!
5,lots of gossip!,"These are stories by long-time readers of Gary Griffin's works, who describe their encounters with really, really well-endowed men. Everyone from royalty to truck drivers. it's a fascinating look at the erotic lives of ""big-boned"" men and the people who love them."
5,so pleased,"i've been anticipating this book since hearing about it earlier in the fall, and it did not disappoint me. the structure of the book is cool...a quick biography and interview of each design firm, some photos of their working spaces and studios (very cool if you like that kind of stuff), and some examples of the designers' work, as well as random photos and scrapbook pages of the visit to japan. my only complaint is that there are not always enough examples of certain designers' work, but there is plenty to look at in this book. for those of you who like colorful, futuristic, if not somewhat imitated (like the work of tDR and designershok) design, or japanese pop culture (anime, manga, videogames, toys, etc), this book is highly recommended."
5,Book,This is a wonderful book. Pictures are beautiful. I had the honor of meeting Neil Wilson the author of this book. Any of his books are well worth the read.
1,rip off shipping,Shipping costs just as much as the actual item. Its very deceptive marketing when they're obviously trying to sell a low end item for the overall same price as the top of the line bike carriers.
3,Charles Ashe Windham - biography of a British general,"Overall, a decent job of combining diary and letters with historical narrative. Almost all the text deals with the Crimean War. Of persons mentioned, the important historical figures are identified in an appendice, but the minor ones appear not to have been researched at all. Only about 1/3 of the text is Windham's own writing.Not very exciting reading, to be honest. Recommended if you're already interested in the man or the Crimean War. Certainly promotes the view that the British commanders were inept and ineffective, with the price being paid by the soldiers in the ranks. Windham himself was a smart and upfront person, but he couldn't change anything just by himself.Mark C."
5,Excellent Center Channel,"I replaces a smaller Sony center channel speaker with this Yamaha one. Big difference, he sound is much fuller and brighter. I'd recommend this to anyone with a home theater"
5,Clarity is what I wanted,"I had trouble understanding dialog with the TV's speakers unless I turned the volume way up, even with my old center speaker. This speaker is so clear that it's not a problem any more. It's also attractive and it doesn't detract from the decor."
5,Yamaha NS-C225 2-Way Acoustic Suspension Center Channel Speaker,I was looking for a small center speaker for my bedroom and I was very surprize with the wonderful sound of this speaker. Even though the speaker is small it has better sound quality than other bigger center speakers I had hear at BestBuy and other vendors.
5,Produces theater quality sound,"I bought this to replace the Sony center speaker and what a difference a small adjustment like that makes. This baby delivers crisp and clear dialogue with decent bass, especially when married to a sub-woofer and Yamaha front speakers. I had no idea what real sound reproduction was until I purchased this speaker. I highly recommend it without reservation."
4,Sounds great,Great sound. Needed a smaller profile speaker to fit under new flat screen. this unit fit the bill.
5,Awesome Center Channel Speaker,If you don't have a good Center Channel Speaker for you surround sound system you are missing out!! I did some looking around and read the review on the Yamaha NS-C225 speaker. I like what a saw so I ordered it. I installed it in my system and it has taken my system to a higher level. Sounds awesome!!!
4,Good Product for the price,"I am running a 7.1 THX system and am happy with the performance of this speaker. Replaced a Bose center that was a little old and too big, this has sharp sound and appears to be of good quality. I would give it 5 stars but that is reserved for the high end equipment, it is an inexpensive speaker, even though a good value."
3,BEATS ME,Who am I to give an informed review on this product? I'm not a stereophile. But the speakers are meeting expectations.
4,Excellent Book and memory refresher,"I wish I had a photographic memory and that I remembered everything I learned in school 15 years ago, but thankfully, I don't have to because I have the portable MBA to refresh my memory. I highly recommend this book. I'd recommend this to even those without an Accounting or Finance degree in order to have a greater understanding of how their company is run - or even running their own company's financial decisions."
4,An essential primer for non-economists,"Did you ever want to learn about ""hedging"", ""options"", and the like? This book teaches the essentials of financial talk. But beware of typing errors, especially in the first three chapters."
4,Good but not the best,"All Moxy albums are rare and precious, but this doesn't quite measure up to others like ""Bargainville"". Still a must-have though for all die-hard fans."
4,nice book,"Nice Book, i buy this book for my son school home work, and he love to do home work on this."
5,Exactly,This is the book taught by the school of my 6 year old daughter. Very good book and easy to understand. Harcourt... You rock.
3,Rip Off,"Come on this disk pack is so over priced. It comes with one disk. A 3 disk pack will cost the same price. Buy this at target,Walmart,or K.B.Toys but not here."
1,Lousy Black & White Picture and Low Quality,"Don't waste your money on VideoNow discs or the player, it's not worth it. There are a bunch of new and inexpensive video players coming out in a few months that are in color. Portable DVD players are also getting cheaper. These VideoNow discs are proprietary, and the more money you spend on them the more money you throw out the window as this will quickly become an obsolete technology and your discs will be worthless."
5,VideoNow,"I thought this was a little bit low tech, but my son and his friends love the player and all of the Sponge Bob discs. My son takes it in the car all of the time. The CD&#146;s are a great value at $15.00 for 3. The SpongeBob and Rugrats are his favorite. This is well worth the money."
5,good for kids,"I think that this is good for a child but if your over 13 or something get a portable dvd player i saw one for $150, but for kids this is great., i said i was 12 but i'm not I really just dont want to give my email to amazon.com"
2,You have to like watching Dance...,"...and I do not. When the 3rd dance sequence began, in the spa, we were done.Compared to the Bach DVD in the same set, it was very disappointing. It is really a Dance DVD."
4,A great find,"I usually do not read romance novels, but I couldn't put this book down. The chapters go back and forth between two stories that are somehow connected. You find out why at the ending of the book. This book made me feel all of the emotions under the sun, and I was upset when it was over. The sequel Rising Tides, is a great ending to this suspenseful and heart breaking story."
5,A ENGROSSING PAGE TURNER,"Elderly Aurore Gerritsen sets out to tell her life story to a young black man , a story full of secrets that she has hidden for a lifetime. So well written with family connections that are surprising.It's a history of Louisiana and delves into race relations, compelling characters and challenging issues. But you don't have to be from the south to enjoy this book and once I started, I immediately ordered the sequel ""Rising Tides"". (which I did not find as fascinating as this book, though it did uncover some family mysteries!). I highly recommend this book!"
4,Good Read,"Because I have read other books by Emile Richards I purchased ""Iron Lace."" I was not disappointed. It was a fascinating story set in New Orleans. The descriptions of the people and the houses were exceptional."
4,Another Winner!,"This is a wonderful story about chances both missed and taken. Alex Carrigan's usually controlled life is turned upside-down by the sudden appearance of a 12 year-old daughter(his?), an aging, dramatic grandfather and a beautiful, smart woman trying to find her soulmate. Alex's grandfather missed his one chance at love and now will Alex let it slip through his fingers as well? Alex's grandfather enlists the help of Faith Christopher, a local bakery owner, to find his true love who he hasn't seen in 50 years and put to rest a terrible family curse. Faith's former fiance's family has taken her under their wing and so she struggles with her feelings for both these families. This is a heart warming story whose only drawback is the flashback dreams that plague Faith but they are relevant to this story so we must endure them."
5,A wonderful book to treasure!,"Wow, what a wonderful love story! I have enjoyed all of Barbara Freethy's books but THE SWEETEST THING is one of her best! The story is so well done I felt I was right there. And I loved the way she has more than one plot going at a time. Faith was the kind of woman I like to read about, independent and self-sufficient, yet open to love. Alex is a great hero. He made me laugh with his frustration dealing with his grandfather and his unexpected teenage daughter. But it was the way the plots all mesh and end happily that left me with the sweetest feeling. I can't wait for the next book!"
4,sweetest thing,Good reading and excellent writing as expected from B. Freethy. Story had some twist to keep your interest and easy reading.
3,The Sweetest Thing,"I found this story to be too predictable. The herione was the most beautiful; the hero, the most handsome. The conflicts between them and then their falling in love was the same old stuff."
3,Fun Read,"Ok, it may not be the epic novel of the year but I thought the story was interesting, sweet and a nice read. It has some quirky characters, which I always love and there was just enough mystery to keep me coming back to read more. The romance scenes were a little meatier than I like, but that's alright. I enjoyed it."
5,The Sweetest Thing,"This is an excellent book. Easy to read, no filth. Best of all, it was on my Kindle and I didn't have to lug a book around. Great for traveling or waiting rooms. All of Barbara Freethy's books have been enjoyable."
3,Feel good romantic story in a perfect world,"The characters are a little too simple. Alex Carrigan is the handsome bachelor who cannot commit. Faith Christopher is the beautful pastry chef who finally gets him to fall in love with her. Without giving the plot away, the story ends in a happy one, but in this jaded world this novel is written more in a teenager mindset."
2,"a little sexy, a little predictable","I should have read a review of this book before I bought it. It was not high literature. It was sexy and kind of fun at times. At other times I was frustrated by the predictability of the character's behavior. Also, the author isn't very good at descriptive writing, so it's missing something."
3,Nothing New,After the first few chapters it became boring. The secondary characters had more personality than the main characters. Plot needs more than a girl falls in love and needs to convince the man he should settle down.
2,"Tired, boring, predictable","Not exactly a good read, I only finished it because I was traveling. It was all I could do to get to the end which was very predictable. Not even a good trashy romance. Don't bother."
3,Just okay,"This definitely was not one of my favorite Barbara Freethy books. It didn't hold my attention like her others. I found myself skimming over the words to get to end of the book, rather than reading each word which is unlike me."
2,The Sweetest Thing,Very poor ending. I could care less about the ancient artifact. Do not like focus on feet. yuck. blah. bad.
4,Susie J.,"I enjoyed the quirkiness of this family book. Romance, some suspense. I liked it. Had never read Barbara Freethy before, so pleasantly surprised. Will definitely check her out again!"
5,The Sweetest Thing is heartwarming -- a great read.,"I'm a big fan of Barbara Freethy, and this latest book is just wonderful. I ended up reading late into the night -- I just didn't want to put the book down! Highly recommended for anyone who's looking for a warm, memorable book (and author), and for all of Barbara's fans."
4,The Sweetest Thing,This was a good read. This is the 2nd book I've read from this author and I enjoy her work. Well written and I'll order other books by her.
2,Boring,"boring, too long and drawn out, not much to the story. Repetitive, predictable, kept waiting for something to happen different."
3,Summer weekend read,"Nice and easy book, good story line but quite predictable ending. Nothing scary, so a good read for relaxation. Don't expect any techno-talk inside the story. Think Maeve Binchy, not Patricia Cornwell. The story could do with a bit more suspense."
3,Story too long,The story is very cute but it went on way to long. I loved the characters and the story line
3,Sweet Story about alternative family relationship,The author provides a view into the world of alternative families and how they can learn to love each other in unexpected ways. I found it very enjoyable to read but i did not feel the ending was very strong.
3,Romantic beach read,Romantic story about the hard-hearted bachelor who is confronted with the past when his uninvited grandfather shows up. Shortly after here comes a young girl whose paternity is questioned. Throw in a little voodoo magic and here comes the beautiful woman helping out the grandfather solve a mystery. Guess what!?! Man meets woman and sparks fly.
1,crappy bulbs,it is amazing how fast these burn out. also a weekly occurnace having to change these with regular ones. cannot recommend...
3,Not a great quality product.,"Fairly good product, the half silvering that the bulb was bought for was uneven with pinpricks of light coming through and some areas where it is too thin."
1,"Extremely fragile, not great quality control","I bought 2 of these bulbs for a pair of kitchen pendants. The first bulb broke off at the base just screwing it in--even with a light touch. It still lit, but obviously would be unsafe. The second didn't break, but my other complaint is that the mirror finish is not perfectly level around the bulb. If you are placing in a fixture with an opaque shade (or no shade), that's probably fine. But if you have frosted or translucent shades, the non-level mirroring will leave a vey obvious and very tilted shadow line on your shades.Overall, this isn't up to the quality or durability standards of the major brands. On a positive note: the mirror coating (inside the bulb) did not have any thin spots or imperfections."
5,Exactly what I needed,"This bulb was the exact replacement for my 2001 Saturn L200 rear window break light. This light asssembly has about 6 of these little lights and they are super expense if I buy them at the dealers. Plus since Saturn is now ""out of business"" it will be even more costly and harder to find, at the garage. So I am glad I found them here. They installed in a heartbeat and I was able to circumvent the charge, by the garage that does my annual State inspection, by replacing these myself... simple task !"
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered this Calligraphy set instead of the dark blue beginners case because I wanted a more unique looking calligraphy pen. Well, I ordered this one and got the dark blue box instead with standard colors. Not exactly happy but I do not wait to wait to get another order."
1,"Fine, Broad, and Broad -- where's the Medium nib?","I want to learn calligraphy, and I bought this set because its price point is right for a new hobby. Today I cracked open the box for the first time, wanting to use the Medium nib, because I figured that was a good thing to start with. But it wasn't there!! I have two nibs of the same size, both labeled ""B"" (for Broad?) and one labeled ""F"" for fine. Does this mean my set was used?? Beware: you get what you pay for.However, to my untrained eye/hand, the pens do seem to work nicely."
3,it was an okay set but not outstanding,It was an okay set but not outstanding and was a good thing I was not looking for outstanding . But it serves a purpose . I would reccomend it for first timers .
3,"awesome set, but ink runs out too fast.",i have used up all of the ink in these pens in almost no time - a few pages of writing and the ink runs out. this is frustrating because the pens are extremely convenient and well functioning otherwise.
3,Good for the price.,"Good pen for the price, which is very inexpensive. Nothing wrong with the way it writes, but it does ""bleed"" a bit, so I have to be cautious in order to avoid a mess. I will buy a higher quality calligraphy pen in the future, but this does the job for my rare need to address several envelopes with script."
5,Good deal for the price works as intended fast ship,"Worth purchasing for an older computer, you^^ would spend double the price locally due to out dated ram. I purchased this for an elderly person, she was very estatic to see the performance upgrade from 512mb to 2g."
4,Very Informative Book on a Great State,"I would certainly reccomend this book to anybody considering a move to Arizona. It includes useful employment information for most of the larger cities, tax information, population statistics, and much more."
1,It's not a toy,the picture has a set of tweezers thus you assume as a customer that you get the full set. I got only one piece! Which was misleading as I could have bought this locally without having to run the shipping costs.
4,Wonderful Companion to Geraes,"5 stars....*yawn*...look, Citizen Kane was a 5 star movie...so I don't want to see 5 stars going to a decent movie, but one clearly not on the same level. Therefore, when compared to Milton's masterpeice, 1972's ""Clube Da Esquina"", this does not deserve the same rating. It's even a slight level below ""Geraes"", it's follow-up album. With that being said, this is still a fantastic album that is worthy of purchase. Set it alongside those albums, as well as ""Clube Da Esquina 2"", ""Milton"" (1976), and ""Milagre Dos Peixes""...and you will have all the best Nascimento ever produced."
2,x ray technician,I am the x-ray technician in the book. Judy was an amazing woman and she made some tough descisions during some tough times. For her to write this book and help others as i'm sure herself gives me great pleasure.I'm sorry for many things but I assure you i am a much better person because of our relationship.M.
2,Slightly disappointed,"I heard them on a TV show in Chicago and decided to buy their new CD.Since I was unable to find it I bought this CD instead. I was disappointed in the songs, compared to the new CD songs I heard on TV."
4,WOW....that's all I have to say.,"Well, if you wanna get a description of what Victory Records has to offer, there is no video greater than this. Not only do you get to see the bands, you get to decide wether or not you like them. The bands range in styles, from all out Hardcore bands like, Snapcase, Strife, Doughnuts, and Integrity, to Punk, and Swing bands like Hi-Fi & The Road Burnners, and Warzone. Overall, this video packs a lot of talent into a bunch of cool videos. All range from live video, to well made ones. Just buy, and enjoy."
5,Olympus,"Hi,the Lens is a great pleasure on my E510. It is very fast and makes a lot of fun to use. Would buy it again"
4,Had to return it to Olympus,"I read all the wonderful review of this lens and decided that it would work well for me in a large part of my photography. However, when I received it, I simply could not get consistently sharp photos, particularly of subjects in motion or with a flash. I took it to my local Olympus dealer, who suggested making sure my camera software was up to date, which it was. Still no luck, so I sent the lens in to Olympus. I don't know what they did with it, because there was no piece of information when I got it back (very quick turnaround, I might add--Thanks, Olympus!). Now, though, it works very well and I have indeed made it my primary lens for general photo shoots."
4,"Very Good,","Not quite as lasting as name brand, but just about. I mean very close. Worth the savings. Will buy again .. OH did i mention the quick delivery? YES I got it within 3 days before christmas. That is Gr8 service."
1,ZENIPOWER HEARING AID BATTERIES,UNFORTUNATELY THE BATTERIES ARE THE WRONG SIZE SO I CAN NOT USE THEM.I WAS GIVEN THE WRONG INFORMATION SO THEY ARE NO GOOD FOR ME.
2,The purchase made was very disappointing.,"I have purchased all the Jock Jams CDs and really enjoy all of them with the exception of Jock Jams 5. I was extremely disappointed in the choice and tempos of music. I found myself tapping my feet to maybe one or two tracks tops. The previous 4 releases had better music, and I enjoy the mix at the end of the CD volume 3 and 4; Jock Jams 5 does not incorporate that into this CD. I feel that this is not as high of quality product as the other 4 Jock Jam CDs. I will be a little more cautious of purchasing Jock Jams Volume 6 if and when it released."
4,"I think this was good, but not compared to jock jams vol.3","this cd was good the sportscenter mega mix should have been there but if there's another jock jams jock rock or slam jams coming out i hope it will be a little more up to date with a mega mix,maybe a mega jam,& a few oldies if any."
2,"Not compatible with Dell Dimension XPS T, L series","This memory is claimed to work in Dell Dim T and L series computers. It does not work in those. Also, return policy does not specify that once you open the item it is no longer returnable."
1,Does not work with my PC - Incompatable - Very Upset,"I ordered ""compatable"" DIMMs for my Dell PC to upgrade the memory. My machine will not boot up with both installed or one installed in either DIMM slot. I hope I can get my money back. I wish I could talk to someone at Viking to get an explanation.I purchased through Viking because Dell does not appear to sell these any longer. Very unhappy."

5,Will Appeal to a Wide Audience,"This is an outstanding, well-written introduction to astronomy that will appeal to beginners and more advanced readers alike. I have a Ph.D. in physics and have studied a lot of astronomy over the years, and found a lot of material here to keep me interested. Many discoveries have been made in astronomy in the last few years, and this book serves as a very nice overview to the field that includes the latest research results. Also included are many nice tips for amateur astronomers and references to Web sites for further information. Very informative, fun to read -- I highly recommend it!"
5,WOW!,"This is a terrific book for any astronomer, serious or casual. If you have ever looked up at the stars or moon, and started asking questions to yourself, they are answered here. All of the following topics are covered: Explanations of antimatter and dark matter, how to search for comets (and instructions for reporting discovered comets), common mistakes of astronomy, upcoming eclipses planet locations and oppositions, what most people don't know about astronomy (did you know there are probably microscopic meteorites in your hair every time you walk outside?), and hours and hours more of extremely pleasurable reading! I LOVE this book; if you know how to read, you will be able to understand some of the most difficult amstronomy concepts!"
5,An excellent introduction to basic astronomy.,"This book is a MUST read for all those interested in astronomy. It is an excellent introduction to the field of astronomy. It really helps the reader to comprehend fundamental astronomy concepts and much more complicated scientific theories and explanations.All fundamental concepts of astronomy are covered, from the big bang to spotting the 88 constellations. It even gives the reader an explanation of antimatter and dark matter (topics which are generally discussed in quantum physics). On top of this, this book gives the reader more references on the various websites dealing with astronomy.In summary, I would deeply recommend this book to all beginners to the topic of astronomy. If the reader desires to dive deeper into this fascinating science, he/she should visit the websites stated in this book."
5,This is the book I was looking for,"I found most astronomy books are tough reads, not written for the wannabe amateur like me.THis book is the exception, it is well written, easy and fun to read."
4,Introductory Material but no math,"I originally read this book for Science Olympiad to learn about the different types of galaxies and the math that went along with it. It was not very helpful in helping me identify the Deep-sky objects but instead only introduced the most general topics (such as black hole, planets, etc.) it also didn't have any math, which was essential for Science Olympiad. I was looking for something beyond this. However, it is an overall a good introductory material."
5,Very Helpful!!,This book is the most helpful book I've ever read. Since I'm new in astronomy I used this book to at least give me the basics. It gave me more than I could ever ask for! Some things I liked just reading about like solar eclipses and reading about the planets. I really don't need to know how to find the planets because my meade etx70at does all the work for me which I highly recomend for the casual observer. Anyways this book is very helpful and I think you'll like it.
4,Stargazing through Amazon,"This is a great book for beginners in the field of Astronomy. Unlike some of the other books I considered purchasing, it is clear cut and easy to understand. Enough content to keep you interested, but not so much it will bog down a beginner.I do wish it had information on astrophotography. If it is there, I have not come across it yet. There are only eight pages of color photos,and more color photos of what you might see would be very helpful. I am planning on using this book in conjunction with a new telescope and the information it provides will certainly get me around the Universe in an informative and fun manner. I am looking forward to getting into this book more as our Missouri sky warms this spring.I was also fortunate to come across this book in a hard back version which I feel is much more practical due to the use this book will get! Amazon was the only source I found that offered a hard back version."
5,nice transaction.,What an easy book to understand. Dont let the dummies series fool you. Even the most intelligent person at times needs things to be brokend down to them in steps. This book does that.
3,Astronomy for dummies,"I am about a third of the way through the book, and the author spends a great deal of time on what he deems as fundamentals, but are really digressions. the book does have good information, but it does appear a bit wordyI would have read it faster, and probably finished by now, but the tedium of wading through somewhat wordy passages slows me down a bit."
4,allstar lineup that delivers,"The first two pieces on this cd deliver beautifully. The entire cd is a little challenging, as two songs in the middle have slightly more ""edge,"" but the final two pieces are wonderful. Smitty sounds great and wrote all of the tunes except one (which was written by B. Brufford for all of you Yes fans). Mostly they are very melodic. You have to love the prescence of the trombone, two saxes, & Wallace Rooney(trumpt.) Great music to cook to!"
3,Force M.D.'s Chillin',CD had too much advertising. I just want the CD and if I knew that would have never ordered it. Doesn't appear to be from teh original manufacturer of the cassette who then put it to CD.
4,"What's it like to fly on a plane, mommy?","This book is great for letting toddlers know what it is like to fly on an airplane, whether it is in preparation for their first flight, reminiscence of previous flights, or just for their imagination.The illustrations are clear and the story is simple. The text is presented in a very clear and large typeface that beginning readers should find quite easy to sound through. The things that are important to a young child are emphasized, such as finding a seat and getting a meal--and the teddy bear is a prominant character that my son really seems to like.It may not be a great piece of literature, but it is a very enjoyable little book!"
3,"Great Intro to Sirius, but buy next generation","I installed this in a car, with the audio going into a Jensen radio and Sirius is one of the best purchases I ever made. But the system keeps dropping out on the classical music channels. We can't tell if it is the Jensen head unit or the satellite tuner - turning either one off and on again brings back those channels for a few minutes. I'm keeping it and buying more Sirius tuners, but from now on will they will be higher end brands (Pioneer, Kenwood) and going into bigger brand head units."
5,Beautiful and Useful!,Gail Bussi's designs are classic and elegant as well as delicately beautiful. This book is full of her signature borders and small motifs. It's worth the cover price for her alphabet alone.
2,the competition,the music track I was looking for from the movie was not on the album. I was very dissappointed
3,Shoestring hits hard but falls short,"Straight from Flint, Michigan comes the Dayton Family's Shoestring. This album could've been much tighter than it is, but it's still worth a listen. ""Wiggy"" starts things off with a high energy track that could get the party crunk. It features Madam Dame and fellow Dayton Family member Bootleg (who kicks a great verse). ""Following a Star"" presents a break from all of the shoot-em-up-gangstafied tracks, but still fails to measure up to such Dayton Family classics as ""Oxydol"" and ""Thru a Thang."" To his credit, Shoe has one of the hardest flows in rap today, but his flow can't shine when it's held back by lame beat/lame hook disease. Overall, this album leaves you wanting more of the old ""What's On My Mind"" & ""F.B.I."" days, which we will hopefully get back with the soon release of the new Dayton Family album."
1,Not the same in new bottle,"I have been wearing this fragrance for over 20 years, since the new bottle has been introduced the scent is not the same, unless my bottle was mislabeled. I used to love this, but now I will always make them give me a tester before I buy"
4,My new YSL Opium...,"I've worn this fragrance for decades...Suddenly there's a new bottle (not the one shown). Pretty as it is---I'm not sure I appreciate it! Keep trying to take the lid off & it doesn't always spray well! Higher cost for this? If it weren't 'my scent', I might try others. Guess I'm over a barrel.Good experience with speed and customer service. Thanks"
5,Opium Eau de toilette,I have worn Opium Eau de toilette for at least 18 years. It is my very favorite perfume. I always get wonderful compliments on this perfume. It is a classic in my opinion!
2,opium toilet water,"My wife has loved Opium over the years but this product does not have the same odor or intensity. Maybe the perfume is better? If you buy this product on line buy it from the manufacturer because if you don't like it they told me they would make it right. However it is more expensive. If possible, probably the best thing to do is buy it at your local department store. You can't return it on line but you can locally.It would be helpful if Amazon were to explain up front that perfumes can't be returned and why!"
2,Poor product description on Amazon site,"I thought this product was a ""dab on"" perfume (longer lasting aroma), not a toilette spray. I couln't be sure by the product description and the product is displayed in a box, not the actual perfume container. Very disappointed. Will have to return it for refund after Christmas."
2,Advertised picture is not what I got. V disappointed.,"I ordered it - after hunting far too long online - for the sleek flat shape shown in the picture above. Instead, II received a short squat bottle. Nearly sent it back but couldn't be bothered with the online return hassle."
1,Opium By Yves Saint Lauent,"This item was so bad--cannot compare with real Opium by Yves Saint Laurent cologne--why do you deal with companies which hose down your customers? I shall stick with Kindle books and hope that I get what I pay for, although even that is questionable."
1,New Opium,"I, too have worn Opium for over 25 yrs., Now they have changed the formulation. It smells awful. Old adage: If it ain't broke ... Don't fix it."" Want my $$$ back."
5,Rodgers the Hammerstein,"Having been a lifelong fan of ""FREE"" and ""BAD COMPANY"" etc. Paul Rodgers has always been a great favourite of mine. His voice (in my opinion) is probably the best there is for a ""white blues vocalist"" who can also easily turn his hand to other types of music!I purchased ""Paul Rodgers - Now"" a few years ago and, loved it! The album covers the whole spectrum of Paul's capabilities so when it was (ahem), borrowed forever I was gutted, buying it again was never a question but, when ""and LIVE"" came as part of the package, well, seventh heaven! OK, so Kossoff, Kirk and Frasier weren't with him on the Free tracks but they are still brilliant!All in all excellent value for money!!!"
4,The Voice,"The more I listen to this, the more I like it. One of the greatest voices in Rock Period. Check out all of his stuff. Free, Bad Co., The Firm, Solo.All Good."
1,"Untrue to life, and not enough recipes!","As an avid Mandie reader, I have found that this thing that you call a ""Mandie Cookbook"" is simply awful. I was flabbergasted at how inaccurate its portrayl of Mandie was, for, it is made quite clear in the 33+ Mandie books in print that Mandie never cooks. She doesn't know how to turn on a stove, and I doubt she would know what in the world a sieve is. In fact, it seems that any physical labor on her part is against the moral values that she was weened upon. Secondly, the recipes did not correlate at all to the plots of the Mandie books. I suggest that more recipes like ""Ghost Bandit Goulash"", ""Dead Dad Dumplings"", ""Mysterious Bell Vegetable Medley"". So, to all those reading this that have been considering buying the Mandie Cookbook, think again! You will not be getting authentic Mandie recipes, but rip-offs that the book company puts together to con gullible young readers. Thank you."
5,Deliver Us From Evil,"I felt that this novel is one of the best works I have ever had the pleasure of reading and living. I have not only completed all the photography for this novel, as well other lituary projects, but also had the valued experience of following the authors through out the entire process of dealing with the episode that were encounted in reasearching this odd and freighting story."
2,Should be listed in the Fiction Section,"The book 'Deliver Us From Evil' is true. And by true, I mean false. It's mostly lies. But they're entertaining lies. And in the end, isn't that the real truth? The answer is: No. It is based on some true events, but in the process, the author switches from non-fiction to fiction. **"
2,Non Fiction? I think not......,"I think that it is interesting to some extent, but that it REALLY should be in the fiction section, or in the comedy section (Because it's so funny that the writers think/believe it's true!)."
2,Pre-code film lost in terrible DVD transfer,"This film was very watchable when first released but......if I had to make a guess, this presentation from Alpha Home Entertainment is a VHS tape copy of a VHS tape copy finally transferred to DVD. The detail is almost gone which ruins the tantalizing scenes featuring Miss Page. It also ruins the excellent wild animal footage included in the film.Only very serious collectors of pre-code films should bother with this one. Only someone who works for Alpha or Amazon.com would give this item 5 stars. Be careful what you read."
2,product not as pictured,"While it shows a variety of colors in the picture, in reality it is all pinks/whites"
5,"Laugh out loud, pure entertainment!","Have you every laughed so much you assume things can't possibly get any funnier, but they do? Well, The Assistants is able to achieve this rare phenomenon. The novel had me completely intrigued and captivated up until the very last sentence with its brilliant and witty writing. I found myself genuinely caring for the five main characters and their tumultuous relationships with their eccentric bosses. I was able to identify with every distinct assistant on some level. Robin Lynn Williams allowed me to have a glimpse of the complex and insane, yet unique, individuals that frolic throughout Hollywood. The characters are so vivid and memorable that when the fun is officially over, I wish I could spend more time with The Assistants."
1,"The ""Assistants"" needs assistance","If I could just get around some of the Jackie Collins-esque adjectives the author uses in this tome, I might me able to stomach reading on. Moreover, somebody forgot to proof this before it went to press! Page 34 has two glaring errors in fact and spelling. The one-dimensional characters are trashy people. Maybe that's the author's point? That ""the business,"" and its people are pure trash? I'm taking this one to the used book store to exchange for a real novel."
4,A grin from beginning to end,"""The Assistants"", a novel by Robin Lynn Williams, is a hoot from beginning to end. The characters are well delineated and each appealing in his own way. The author apparently had a bad experience with Hollywood agents, because she depicts them as stupid, greedy, and devious incompetents who depend entirely on the neediness of their clients and employees for their success. Especially amusing is Rachel, a na??f who hails from a small suburb of Houston and believes that all people are basically good and honest. I have to question whether good fortune would smile on such a person quite as broadly as it does on Rachel, but it's fun to pretend."
4,Fast and Entertaining Read,"I really enjoyed this book, much to my surprise. I've worked as an assistant myself, not for celebrities, but for powerful and locally prominent people, and the sorry fact is that the depictions of the seriousness in which the people take themselves and their needs and the attitude and devotion expected of their staff is not exaggerated. While the happily ever outcome may not be realistic, I thought the stories of each character had an air of authenticity and believability.Somehow Robin Lynn Williams manages to keep the story from being depressing and makes the assistants likeable. If you're looking to be entertained and amused, this is a good pick, as I really enjoyed the book."
2,Let Down,"I guess I'm the only one who agrees with the opinion that this book was a disappointment. I read the short review by a favorite author of mine, Lauren Weisberger, on the back of the book and expected to thoroughly enjoy it. That's not exactly what happened. The beginning of the book was promising with the introduction of all of the characters but they never really developed.I was especially disappointed by the ending. Beside it feeling rushed, it was clear that the story took off when Rachel was introduced but it wasn't Rachel that explained how everyone ended up. Among the other upsets were the grammatical errors, overuse of Microsoft Word-like insertion of synonyms, random camera/direction notes, and overall lack of detail.Also, the comparison of this book to Office Space is laughable."
3,"# 11 blades, not for piercing.","Looking at the tip of the #11 blade you may assume that due to the very fine point, it may have applications in piercing, truth is, it does not. The blade slices well enough, the fine tip serves for more control in that regard, however had I known it was no good for penetrating without slicing, I'd of stuck with my #10's."
1,VERY POOR TRANSFER,"I have a large collection of IMAX DVDs. I enjoy them because the video quality is usually stunning. Playing them on my 65 inch screen normally produces a very fine picture. I dont know what happened with the transer on this film, but it is poor at best. Black and shadow areas are filled with artifacts and the overall picture quality is very grainy and rough appearing. The company responsible obviously chose to go the cheap route on the video tranfer. Also, I agree with the previous reviewer about the cliff climbing botanist. Too much time was wasted on this guy climbing a cliff without a line or safety helmet. The whole sequence may have been staged. I cant believe anyone would be so dumb and reckless to do this without some basic protection. This DVD will not be a keeper in my collection."
3,Adequate,"This is a rambling look at natural aspects of Hawaii (all the islands). It is very rambling. The music score is not memorable, the photography is outstanding, as in many IMAX films. I was disappointed. Reader's Digest 'Hawaiian Paradise' laser disc was more interesting and better done."
1,Extremely disappointed.,"There are few redeeming qualities I can point to in this very boring presentation. I kept hoping it would just end already. While there are moments of majestic Hawaiian views, they are few and far between. Much time is wasted focusing on a self-important ""naturalist"" who just tries to show off that he climbs rock faces without a safety line. Please. I wanted more waterfalls and volcanoes, not sedating ego trips. Too late for a refund?"
3,Better on Imax,"I agree with the first viewer. It's better on the big screen- also it is very short. If you really want to experience what it's like to sit on Hawaii's beaches virtually, I'd highly recommend ""Hawaiian Dreams."" It beautifully captures the different beaches and sunsets on all 6 islands."
3,"Good on video, but spectacular on IMAX","I saw the movie seven times at the IMAX theater in Hawaii. I thought was a really fun movie with spectacular imagery, especially when rendered in IMAX. But watching the video, I realize that most of the fun of this movie was in watching it on the giant IMAX screen. The movie should still be interesting for people who haven't seen it before, but it was really meant to be viewed as larger than life, in the way that only IMAX can.A good movie for fans of Hawaii, and a nice reminder for those who have seen it on the big screen, but if you have the chance, by all means watch it in IMAX. It will blow you away!"
3,What about non-hidden Hawaii?,"This is a great film for seeing how the earth has changed, and is changing. Its sort of a behind the scenes look at Hawaii's newest island--not due for a thousand lifetimes yet. But I was hoping for more shots of beautiful beaches, and crystal blue water."
5,Works even better than I expected!,"Wow! Better than I expected. I had considered an IPOD for working out, but thought I would miss the fleixibility of listening to the radio so I bought this to listen to radio primarily and bail out to a CD when on comercial breaks. It works really well and I really like the remote control feature that keeps me from accidentally dropping and breaking it!"
5,Really good cd/mp3 player,"It's a really good cd/mp3 player, works wonderful. Just one problem- I cannot find a belt case for it. Otherwise, runs perfect!"
4,Full of features,"I like the features of this player. However, the controls are a bit hard to use, and the start and stop controls make a loud beep that, if transmitted to an amplifier may damage the speakers. So watch out for that."
4,GOOD SYSTEM,I really appreciate the ATRAC compression system available on Sony's products. I sprend a great deal of time riding a bicycle and the fact that you can compress 10 audio CDs on one ATRAC CD results in more riding and less fiddiling with changing CDs.
2,poorly designed,"First of all the ""off"" button was in a lousy location. I kept turning it off by accident just holding it. It was also very fussy about what it would play. It also took a long time for it to recognise a cd or mp3. It completely broke down a year and a month after I bought it. Some water splashed on it while I was doing dishes and now only the radio works. I'm surprised because all my other Sony stuff lasted years."
1,Menu & feature items not accessible,"Sony DNF430 MP3/ATRAC CD Walkman Portable Compact Disc Player with AM/FM/TV/Weather Digital TunerI bought this to play audio CDs and listen occasionally to the radio based on star ratings. After a lot of fooling around I was able to get the volume control to work about half the time. The radio works and it plays CDs. None of the menu and various setup features are accessible. The instructions are useless; it's all by trial and error, mostly error. There is a toggle switch that seems to be central to the operation, but it is largely unresponsive. Working it several times usually results in a volume adjustment, but other times it switches away to unbidden modes. This gadget has endless features with impenetrable secret codes required to use them. I would certainly never buy this model again. There must be better products on the market."
1,Practically No Stick Nice color,"these are practically without stick, they are not the regular stickiness of contact paper. it is shelf liner, but not with the normal stickiness of Contact paper"
5,One of the giants films of Federico !,"Fellini paid his personal tribute to Roma , and he memorialized himself for the first time ; this is simply one the most ravishing films in any age , filled with bitter humor and incisive insights .Fede built the movie as a set of delightful vignettes , making a great journey around the great city .From the initial sequence in which we are in the middle of a hell traffic to the warm rendition of that admirable and unforgettable Anna Magnani the greatest actress of the italian cinema ever , but when you watch the recreation of the WW2 music hall and the unforgettable parade in the Vatican for priest and nuns you will be absolutely sure that no other filmmaker (with the supreme exception of Luis Buñuel) has been able to state a freedom state with barroque and dazzling images and sardonic approach as FeFe."
3,Kind of a mess.,"I found it really hard to love this film as I do his others. Same thing goes for Satyricon. This film just seems like Fellini showing off and going on a visual rant. I had the same vibe watching this film as I did watching ""Akira Kurosawa's Dreams.""I really think the magic in Fellini's films dissapeared after 8 1/2. Roma seems like an attempt at simulating that magic.I will give this film 3 stars for the fashion show segment. Seeing priests on rollerskates made me laugh."
4,Hard to appreciate,"Roma is a film about Rome by one of the most revered film directors who ever lived - Fellini. As a piece of simple cinema entertainment this has little to offer; there is no plot and no characterisation, which makes it tough going if you are used to traditional Hollywood films. To have some understanding of the history of Rome will certainly help, but even then you may find this difficult to take. Where the film succeeds is Fellini's amazing direction and stunning use of images and colours. If you approach this film like you would a brilliant painting then it begins to make sense. However two hours is a long time to stare at a brilliant painting!My initial reaction is perhaps a little negative compared with previous reviewers, however, I suspect that this is a film that will improve with repeated viewings. Nevertheless if you mainly watch mainstream movies I'd advise caution before buying - rent it or watch it on TV first."
5,Crude and artistic,"After watching this movie I am pretty sure it was not funded by the Rome Touristic Board. Crude, dirty, rainy, hot, sweaty, disorganized, all round mess it depicts almost every major citie's reality. This film is pure genius, a movie to own , not to rent."
2,No more Hannah for me.,"The stories were variable in quality, but one theme prevailed throughout: misogyny. Hannah only writes about women in the most limited terms: as sexual objects, as the tragically frail pining for lost love, or as housekeepers. Hannah knows nothing about women. His stories from the female perspective are laughably bad, rife with p*nis envy. This is a collection of machismo stories that despite their occasional beauty, read mostly like a series of fart jokes."
2,Woefully uneven collection,"A collection of stories mostly about southern racists, misogynists or ignoramuses, this collection rarely gets on track. A dull Civil War story will follow a perverse and sloppily written tale of an ignorant and mean-spirited man doing stupid things."
1,"fell flat, flat","I had to read and reread and reread many of these stories in order to understand that there was nothing to understand. I have no idea what he was attempting to do, or if he attempted and did what he planned to do, I had no idea what it was he did. ""Testimony of Pilot"" was probably the only normal story in this collection. And I'll admit, it was a damn fine story. It amounted to twelve dollars for one story, and, that, for me, didn't feel worth it. Or maybe I'm just stupid--maybe ever story made perfect literary sense. As an avid reader of Raymond Carver, I am not easily impressed by short stories, since, being an English Major and a student of writing and Carver, I have certian expectations of short story writers. For one, don't be too literary--I get enough of Lit BS from going to class, and second, don't try to showboat or reinvent the short story. Or maybe I'm just ignorant--that could be it!"
2,Not effective for my dry cuticles,My hands and cuticles are very dry and this was not moisturizing enough for me. It did not help in the strength or growth of my nails.
1,Waste of money.,"This is crap. I'm glad they don't sell it anymore. Terrible reception, audio feedback, poor signal strength. It does nothing right."
2,Small Book. Few Answers.,"The book is very good in explaining the answers, but the answers provided are not even 'every odd'--they are randomly chosen. At that price, it's not worth the money. Trust me."
4,good Low Cost Screen,"I got a refurb model for $80, it looks great and works great. Easy to hang, though I had to buy some hooks for my hanging situatuion. But it is very adaptable, and pretty dang big!"
3,Its ok,"Ok I believe this tank is a 30 gallon...thats what it said on the packaging paper when i got it. I wouldnt have bought it had I known, but anyways. This sucked that they didnt put the size, it just seemed a bit sketchy to me.This tank has 3 cutouts on top, pretty small, I'm cutting them a bit wider, since I have turtles. Its a pretty great size tank overall, I just hate that the top is glued on. I would have prefered one with no top or one that comes off."
1,NOT 100 GALLON,"THIS IS NOT A 100 GALLON TANK, EVEN THOUGH WHEN YOU DO A SEARCH FOR 100 GALLON THIS IS THE FIRST ONE THAT POPS UP, SO THAT IS A BIT...ODD? OR SUSPICIOUS IT DOES NOT SEEM CORRECT AT ALL WHEN YOU LOOK FOR SOMETHING AND IT SHOWS AND THEN YOU ORDER IT AND REALIZE THAT ITS NOT AS DESCRIBED, IF ONE KNOWS SOMETHIN ABOUT TANKS THEN YOU WOULD SEE THE DIMENSION MEASUREMENT IN INCHES COULD NOT BE A 100 GALLON, BUT IF NOT YOU WOULD HOPE THAT A SELLER WOULD HAVE YOUR BEST INTENTIONS IN MIND TO KEEP FROM COMING BACK FOR MORE, BUT AS i READ THE OTHER REVIEWS FROM PEOPLE THE VERY SECOND ONE STATES THAT IT WAS SMALLER THAN HE THOUGHT, SO ASK YOURSELF THIS BEFORE BUYING, WOULDN;T ONE THINK THAT AFTER GETTING A POOR REVIEW BECAUSE OF HOW IT SHOWS UP IN SEARCHES OR AT THE VERY LEAST SAY IT IS NOT ON THE PAGE? THIS SELLER DID NOT, SO THAT IS WHY I WILL NOT BUY THIS FISH TANK, THOUGH I ALMOST DID..."
4,A good man writing well,"Cecil Murphey gets to the heart of the matter. You know that when he talks earnestly about a God who pursues, he's talking from experience. He also gets to the heart of Bible stories and uses contemporary illustrations to flesh out some really essential principles about life and spirituality.This would be a wonderfully healing experience for anyone who's been burned out, or browned out by unhealthy religion."
5,A Breath Taking Experience!,This Book will make you feel like you just finished seeing the movie again.It'll make you want to keep reading this book.It explains the whole story very detailed.While you read this book you get pictures in you mind from the movie! Once you pick it up you can't put down.Take my advice and try it out!
3,"Good cozy, but problems","The sole thing I found wrong with this book is poor police work. The murder victim is shot dead and found next to a gun. In this entire book, no one -- not even the police nor the mayor -- ever once used the word ""fingerprints.""Other than this flaw, it's a good cozy mystery, although you always wonder how anyone can successfully run a hardware store with such unpredictable operating hours."
5,Also great bread recipes,"The soup recipes are excellent, but I really like the bread recipes better. I have made a lot of those and they have been great--quick, easy and delicious."
5,Couldn't resist this book!,"I passed this book on a library cart, stopped and picked it up, was intrigued, checked it out, brought it home and read it, and finally decided I have to have my own copy. What a great cookbook, with lots of breads, soups, and salads that I can't wait to try. The breads are mostly innovative quick breads, and thank goodness for so many new picnic and potluck salads besides the tired old mayo-doused macaroni ones. I like the little intro at the beginning of each recipe, it's informative and entertaining and gives you a preview of how your final result will turn out. Most of the soup recipes can easily be modified to be low in fat (for example add evaporated milk instead of cream). My kids are adventurous eaters so I plan to try many many of these recipes, but there are few exotic ingredients or oddball flavor combinations, so I definitely think of this as a ""family friendly"" cookbook."
5,One of my favorite cookbooks ever!,"My sister recommended this book to me and I completely LOVE it! I dare you to read his descriptions of soups and not start drooling. Then you will head to the store with a list and start cooking! I have really liked every recipe so far and want to try all the soups and many of the salads and breads, too!"
5,Wonderful Story!,Great Story of Degas' Little Dancer! I'm a teacher and use this to tell her story before we see the sculpture at our art museum. Love it!
5,Degas child book,Book arrived on time. The condition of the book was as described. There was not anything noticeably wrong with the book
4,Good price great performance,"This was a great part of a new system that I built, but I did not use the CPU cooler that came with it. I used it on an EVGA SLI motherboard and the combo proved great for playing games such as Team Fortress 2."
5,Intel Q6600 CPU on an INTEL DP35DP motherboard,"This is a Very fast CPU. and well worth the money. I paired it up with a Intel Motherboard model DP35DP. Both work fine togeather.Make sure you buy the more recent version of the CPU with GO stepping, and eSpec SLACR. Box code on the outside of the box is BX80562Q6600SLACR.The reson I mention this is if one use's the same Mobo. The Intel DP35DP motherboard is fully compatable later model of this CPU and only casualy compatable with previous model of the CPU which has a different stepping. It comes down to the revision's on the board. The GO stepping of the later model CPU's is said to be Much much better than previous version.None the less a HIGHLY recomended CPU at a good price. Thank You AMAZON.com"
5,Excellent CPU,This processor works flawlessly and runs cool even in a room that is in the mid 80s. It is much faster than my 3.6 Ghz Pentium 4 cpu that I replaced it with. I am running it on a Ga-x48-DQ6 Gigabyte motherboard with 4 Gig of Gskill memory in a VX4000 Thermaltake case with a Sapphire HD 3870 graphics card. The case has a large fan in the front and the rear and a mid size fan on the side and is a very cool running case. My girl friend has almost the same setup in the same case with the same cpu and it runs very cool too.
5,Well valued price!,"I installed into a Dell XPS410 and it was recognized immediatly by bios.G0 stepping SLACR, computer runs on one processor most of the time and scales up when work load increases. Noticable improvement, recommend over any other processor for XPS410. Have owned for 30 days."
5,Good performance,"This processor is quite stable, it is heated a little more. Intel heatsink is very good and super silent. In graphic design programs and 3d programs manages the data of excellent multimedia and gaming. Good Performance."
4,Outstanding processor,"I gave 4 stars for this processor because i could not get the newer version with g0 stepping for overclocking. I overclocked this processor up to 3.6ghz using Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3 motherboard. The temperature is at idle (50 degree) and full performance (58 degree) with Freezer Pro 7 CPU cooler; thus, I'm not very happy with its temp. I guess Thermaltake Big Typoon cooler can do better job than Freezer Pro 7 because I'm using it for my E6600 cpu ( its core 1 temp at idle is 36 degree and core 2 at 35 degree and less than 48 degree at full speed). Back to this unit, it's a no mistake purschasing Q6600. Lastly, I recommend buying at least 3 ghz memory if you are going to build a new computer with Windows Vista."
5,Blazing fast,I got this because it's the only quad-core processor that my pretty outdated motherboard is compatible with. I am very satisfied with the performance and multitasking is a breeze now.
3,"Nice, except for one thing...","Wonderful product, except I was missing the screws. I exchanged the wall pocket for another one. It didn't have any screws also. Glad the two sided tape is still working."
1,NO. STOP WHILE YOU ARE BEHIND.,don't waste your time. have the time of your life listening to something else.
1,Spare me.,"Please spare me. This was so popular only because it was released (widely) at the right time. The same version minus the string section is found of Green Day's Geek Stink Breath single from '95. SAME EXACT SONG. Best song of the year it was released (widely)? Hell no. ""It's No Good"" was released the same year, and deals with the same 'come back to me, despite life's decisions we'll be together' type lyrics, but was handled in an adult way. BJ can't carry a single note or write an original lyric."
5,Have The Time Of Your Life,"I like Greenday quite a bit, they're one of my favorite bands.I also love this song, it's one of the best. I know a lot of you will read this and think ""who is this person kidding, that is SO not the best song"" (well maybe not those exact words) but I still love it. It's very true, and makes a great graduation song or ""goodbye"" song.If they play this at gradution, I know I'll cry. Don't laugh! It takes a good, emotional to get me worked up like that, so that says something. Well, I'll get off my soapbox now. Have the time of your life listening to this song. As long as you're expecting something TOO edgy, I know you will."
5,This CD kicks serious @$$,I really like this CD because it is the first mellow song Green Day has ever written. I really recomend it to anyone anywhere.
3,"For ""Teenie-Boppers"" not adults","The first 6 chapters are ok....but the information is very repetitive...from chpt 7 on is for hormonal little girls. The book does chronicle Derek's life but the author could not find enough material to fill the book...it repeats throught the book, a teenage girl would love this book, a person who is a baseball fan will find this painfull, a Jeter fan can get through it. Derek Jeter: A Yankee for the New Millennium is a much better book for baseball fans over the age of 17."
5,derek jeter is number i,this was a great book on derek jeters accomplishments dreams and just everything you will need and want to know about derek jeter> i really like the quote that is used i think by his parents: you can't change what happenes:) so if you like derek jeter you will love this book
1,Don't Bother,"It was absolutely painful to get through this book.I realize it was an unauthorized biography, but I really didn't need to spend money to read interviews with Derek's 4th grade teacher, snippets of Joe Torre's memoirs, or recaps of what other writers that Derek actually spoke to had to say.The author seemed to know he didn't have enough material for a book so he just took up space, wasting tons of pages talking about (and repeating) utter nonsense, or things that had nothing whatsoever to do with Derek Jeter, the person.Though it's meant more as a motivational book for kids, I thought ""The Life You Imagine"" provided much more information, which actually came from Derek himself. I'd buy that one if you're interested in learning about Derek Jeter."
3,Good value for an inexpensive center speaker by Yamaha.,"Here is a nice compact Center Channel Speaker for an entry level system. The Yamaha NS-C125 is a great Home Theater value. The sound is clean and clear. Not very powerful or deep but certainly acceptable. If you are looking for a speaker with good sound and won't break your wallet, then look no further. I would also suggest you use this center speaker with the matching NS-125 Tower Speakers and Rear Speakers by Yamaha, another good value.NUFF SAID!"
3,Good Speaker,Compliments my rest of the sound system. cannot say great product but i have no complains.
3,Was expecting better performance,"I do not have experience with some other center speaker (other than some basic home theater speakers) to compare this with, but it seems to me that for the price I paid, the performance (clarity/base) could have been better."
5,A Problem With One Reviewer,"I am the author of this book. The single star review of my book is okay in and of itself. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. But the reviewer states that my book is a rip-off of Conybeare and Howson's 1851 book on the Apostle Paul -- and that is a flat-out lie. There are eleven pages of footnotes in ""Evidence and Paul's Journeys,"" most from twentieth century works dealing with historical evidence that C-H had no knowledge of. Even the main nineteenth century authorities that I cite are all post-Conybeare and Howson, as is their evidence. (On Paul's letters, I relied heavily on Paly, who is actually before C-H). Indeed, I did not use C-H as a source at all because they are just too dated. This review should be taken down by Amazon, since it is a fraud."
4,"Very Good, informative, readable","I used this book to supplement a teaching series on Paul's journeys. I found the book to be easily readable, very informative, and interesting. In my opinion, anybody who wants to study the missionary journeys of Paul should read this book. The extra-biblical evidence is not only interesting but encouraging and faith building."
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for something more about the actual travels of St. Paul rather than a bunch of ""yes, it is possible"" comments. While the reading was dry, the book was short, and I did learn something things."
2,Very Disappointed,"This book contains so many sentence fragments and run-on sentences that I was unable to use it with the students I work with. I'm not sure if it was just poorly edited, or if that is the norm now with some of these adaptations but it's definitely not acceptable in most classrooms and it does a huge disservice to the original.I had been looking forward to introducing some reluctant readers to this story, as we had already read and enjoyed many other titles in this series.The other Stepping Stone Classics are really well written so this was a big disappointment. I will avoid any adaptations by this author in future. Our students have enough difficulty putting a coherent paragraph together without internalizing this type of example."
3,I thought it was cool!!!!!!!,It was pretty interesting. The most interesting part was when the warlocks caught on fire. I recommend this book for seven year olds up to ten year olds. If the time traveler got stuck in the warlock's homes and they killed him and Ween ran and told her friends what happened then I think it would be a five star book.
5,Couldn't paint without it.,"This product works well, especially if you take a few days or even weeks to finish a painting. I wash and re-use each peice of paper several times because it's very durable, it's great!"
4,A painters best friend,Keeps my paints fresh and wet which saves me money! My only complaint is the size... a couple inches larger would be awesome.
3,The Gloves,"Decent documentary. I didnt think it was that great. It does give you some insight to how boxers train for the golden gloves in New York, but I felt the fights were short, the training wasnt in great detail, and the finale was upsetting cause you kind of wanted to root for the other guy. None of these fighters in the film were that great, or dedicated to the sport. Its cool to watch if your a hardcore boxing fan, but if not, youll probably get bored as there were not much backstory, charisma, or character in the boxers portrayed. This is evidence as to why the Heavyweight division is now one of the worst."
5,very good,"sorry my english, i will try write correct. OK, lets go. this is my first by in amazon.com, i like the system of sale. excelent book! excelent shiping!"
3,Why does Amazon.com not have this for sale on DVD?,"The film is available for release on 1/11/2005 on DVD but, for some strange reason, Amazon.com is not selling it."
2,Howard Hughes what were you thinking?,"Bad acting is never so fun as when it's done by Ernest Borgnine. The movie is pretty lame, but still kind of ironically fun. I guess it was a big budget movie at the time but the arctic sets are not convincing. Howard Hughes must have been senile as well as schizo to go ga-ga over this movie - I really can't recommend it."
4,Can't beat Alister McClain,"Just a good solid sci-fi/adveture picture. This is what the studio put up against 2001 a space odessey. Good actors, good special effects for the day. Great story from the cold war, you'll like it."
3,Great Cold War Drama,Action adventure set at the height of the Cold War between Russia and the USA. Great Movie with a Great Cast!
3,"OK, But The Book Was Better, And Made More Sense","This film was adopted from Alistair MacLean's novel of the same name, but the novel had the advantage in that it made sense. The film has some good scenes but is infected by Hollywood's view that the two super powers were morally equal. And although both Patrick McGoohan and Ernest Borgnine are fine actors, they are given some stupid lines. The character of Jim Brown isn't in the book (that I recall). I'd recommend the film despite its flaws but, since it's Hollywood, don't expect a logical plot. (Oh, and in the book, the good guys get the material, the Soviet lose. In the film, it's a draw)"
4,Cold War in the proper setting.,"At the time this film was released, the spy satellite at the center of the story was considered a science fantasy. We know better now. Cold war thriller with all the implausible elements all too plausible in the present time."
3,Just OK,"""Ice Station Zebra"" is just OK -- it is a dated ""brink of World War III"" Cold War-relic. Most notably, it is overlong and suffers from a wooden performance by Rock Hudson, who is stiffer than the ice floes at the North Pole. Shoddy special effects and sets also detract. On the positive side, performances by Patrick McGoohan and Ernest Borgnine were well worth watching. One comes away wishing McGoohan, best known for his television work as ""The Prisoner"" and ""Secret Agent"" (AKA ""Danger Man""), had been in more films."
3,"Shows its age, but good fun","I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and it's not too bad even now. Some of the special effects show their age (particularly jets flying at the end), but the movie is still good fun. Fairly good action and if you haven't seen it before, keeps you guessing as to who the bad guy will turn out to be in the end. Family friendly. Wouldn't pay more than ten bucks for it, but I do recommend it."
2,Does NOT contain the extended episodes!,"Warner Home Video has confirmed that this set contains the NBC broadcast episodes, and NOT the extended episodes that were previously released on DVD. According to TVShowsOnDVD, ""The extended cuts were special versions created for the DVDs and no longer exist in a form that could be used for a Blu-ray release."" For that reason, I sadly cannot give this product any more than two stars."
1,Edited Blu-Ray version stinks,"Everyone who's read the reviews for Friends Blu-Ray knows why it's a bad bargain. I'm writing in order to add yet one more one-star review to the already impressive collection of them on Amazon. To Warner Bros.'s credit, it does state on the front of the box I bought that these are the original NBC episodes. To their discredit, it does not explain why they felt it necessary to mention the subject at all. There were, apparently, several hours of extended material on the DVDs. All of that in a HD format probably would have meant one or two Blu-Ray discs to the 21-disc collection. That's why they did it; but they should have been more forthright in their explanations. Thank God for Amazon reviews!"
1,The one with the double dip rip off,"Sorry but I refuse to be ripped off like this, Why on earth would they release the cut versions thinking people will buy? I won't be buying this version only for Warner to release a ""special extended edition box set"" in a years time.Warner should have followed the example of the release of Star Trek TNG on bluray, where every episode has been remastered with new effects and extended bit cut in."
2,Deleted Scenes,The show has a lot of deleted scenes in it. Definitely not worth buying. I need to find one that is not chopped up.
1,Won't be buying this since they are the edited version,"Shame shame shame on you WB. Friends fans are your target audience. Your fans demand the uncut extended versions LIKE THAT ARE ON THE DVDs.I was all excited about this and had it on pre-order. As soon as I heard the news about these being the short 'tv' episodes, I cancelled immediately.Extremely disappointed."
4,We finally have Friends on HD Blu-Ray... stop complaining!,"I realize many people are upset that these aren't the extended versions of the episodes with the ""deleted scenes"" included as part of the episodes as they did for the DVD set. However, keep in mind, the sound and picture quality are amazing for a 90s sitcom, and the packaging and included booklet are fabulous. I've seen so much detail that I never noticed in the hundreds of times I've watched the DVD episodes. In summary, I choose to focus on the fact that I can finally watch my favorite show in HD widescreen Blu-Ray, instead of getting over-focused on the drawbacks. And remember, these episodes are how the show was meant to be watched. :)"
2,Disappointing - Edited versions,"Please be aware that these episodes will NOT be the versions found on the DVD sets. They will be the originally broadcast versions, missing quite a bit of footage that was added for the DVD release (some wonderful jokes, scenes, and moments). Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing this set - I'd rather have DVD quality visuals and the full extended versions I am used to and love, rather than jarring missing footage.(To be fair, this set will show the episodes as originally intended, but I never watched them on TV when they aired originally, so for me, it is a deal breaker.)"
1,Why only broadcast versions? Boo Warner Bros!,"I cancelled my pre-order because I just found out that this set won't contain the extended episodes already released on DVD, just the original broadcast episodes. And they're asking close to $200? I don't think so! I think a blu-ray release should contain more, not less, content than previous releases. Blu-ray is a premium product, and they ask a premium price, so buyers should get premium content."
1,See Less In HD,"Blu rays should contain more than a standard DVD not less. That was the reason for its inception. More storage as well as an HD picture. This set costs more than any previous Friends release and yet contains less. Its a no brainer, I will not be buying. Re watch the DVD's and catch the previously broadcast episodes in HD on television. To do otherwise would send the wrong signal to Warner Bros. and they will keep ripping the public off. The boring excuse that ""Real Fans"" shouldn't mind is bogus. You shouldn't have to cash in expectations of quality just because you're a fan of something."
2,No Content - no buy,"It's just crazy what they are doing. ""Hey, we want to make money selling Friends in HD, so let's make it the way nobody would want to buy it"". Stupid decision - I almost preordered it, then I found out about the broadcast version inside - now it's not gonna happen."
2,Missing Footage/Picture Just Ok,"The extra footage that was added to the DVD release is missing from the Blu-ray release. The missing footage was great, and my girlfriend was hugely disappointed when she discovered it was missing. Additionally, there is only a minor improvement to picture quality - nothing impressive. If you care about the extra content, get the DVD or wait to see if they ever release a Blu-ray version with all the footage."
2,SAVE your money!!,Why release the syndicated version when the expanded versions are out on dvd? the conversion was poorly done except for the WB logo. Scenes are fuzzy and out of focus. So not worth the money i spent out of my christmas bonus! will not recomend and wish i could return this item. Already returned it one time when the dvd sleeves fell apart!!
3,Wish they had extended cuts,"I don't have the set yet but I must write about the lack of extended episodes in the release. These episodes were made for the DVD release but they apparently don't have the original film. I understand why they can't create true high definition but upconvert it and put it in anyway. Make it an option atleast for those of us that are used to these extended cuts. I am not sure how many episodes are ""extended"" but they can't just cut all that content. I will buy the set simply because I love the series and want to see it in better quality I just wish that they had the extended episodes with HD stock and upconverted sections of missing film. I guess I'll have to keep the dvd set handy. I wish I never would have seen the extended episodes because I hate realizing that a line is missing like when you watch it in syndication."
1,"What did we ever do to you, Warner???","My boyfriend spotted this at Best Buy last weekend and suggested maybe Santa could bring it to me... So I logged on today to add it to my Wish List, but now that I've read all the one-star reviews, I'm definitely out!! Get the extended content ready on HD and I'll gladly pay to own Friends all over again!!"
1,Sadly disappointed,"Unfortunately i will not be purchasing this Blu-ray box set now, or ever, Unless WB decides to publish ALL the episodes as they are on the DVD's. This is a huge disappointment! I am really surprised that so much great footage has been cut from almost every episode, and what, they thought no one would notice?!?!???? I'll keep my DVD's! Thanks."
1,5 STAR SHOW but 1 STAR for bein incomplete,I love Friends. It is my favorite sitcom of all time and I couldn't wait to buy it on Blu-Ray but they decided to release it without the extended versions I will not be buying it. This is pretty pathetic; they should have extended the episodes even more than the DVD versions because it's more expensive.High definition is awesome but I'm going to avoid buying this until they release a complete version.
1,Broadcast Versions?! No Sale!,"Friends is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I was so excited to hear that the episodes were going to be released on Blu-ray. But then, I found out that this set only contains the BROADCAST versions of each episode, meaning each episode is significantly cut down to fit a 1/2 hour TV time slot.This is totally unacceptable. Why should I (or anyone that owns the Friends DVD's for that matter) downgrade my episodes to the Broadcast versions? I already own the complete DVD set, and that set has the FULL-LENGTH episodes! Yes, they are now being presented to us in HD, but that is not worth it if we are losing so many hours of unbelievable comedy!My word of advice: Stick with the Friends DVD's, because buying this set will mean losing out on SO MUCH Friends comedy."
4,"I don't mind that these are the broadcast version episodes, and here's why...","While I thoroughly enjoyed the extended cuts on the DVD versions, this collection will give you a chance to watch the episodes in the manner in which they were intended to be watched, and in high definition!And it's completely understandable why these HD versions must be the broadcast versions and I think, in the long run, the quality of the picture and audio, as well as some nifty packaging, far outweighs the need for an additional 2-3 minutes of bonus jokes per episode."
3,Audio???,Will these have the AWFUL high pitched audio that is shown on Nick at Nite HD? They look sped up and they sound like chipmunks. Please tell me this wont be like that.
2,"Warner, LISTEN!","I just wrote to Warner Bros., saying that if they're going to release a Friends Blu-ray Disc boxset, they are going to have to put the extended versions that were first made for DVD release onto the Blu-ray Discs in 1080p24p/60i and Dolby Digital Plus 48KHz/24-bit 7.1 form, and they're going to have to add additional footage that originated from the broadcast prints to these new Blu-ray prints that may have been removed for some unclear reasons.Yeah, this word should be spread to them."
1,RIP-OFF,"As a Friends fanatic, I am extremely disappointed, to say the least, that the Blu-Ray version does not contain the full episodes. Will definitely NOT be purchasing this set, however would have gladly forked over twice as much for the full episode versions on Blu-Ray."
1,oh ..... :( no ......,"Warner Home Video has confirmed that this set contains the NBC broadcast episodes, and NOT the extended episodes that were previously released on DVD..."
3,Not full episodes :(,"Was looking forward to buying this, but not when it's not the full episodes. How hard would it have been to have the extended on here?"
1,Another Disappointed Customer,"I was planning on ordering this until I did more research. I will go ahead and add to the many ""they're not the extended episodes"" rants. I will not be buying this boxed set on principle. I refuse to pay for less content. I am in the process of collecting FRIENDS on DVD, and that will have to do. If the extended episodes are released on Blu Ray, I will be all over that. But not before then. You miss far too many priceless jokes by going with the edited episodes.What a shame."
1,Boooooo!!!!!,"My wife made me a fan of this show, we watch it together all the time, but I will not upgrade to HD just to downgrade in content."
1,None of the fans should buy this!,"No fan should buy this set even if its a chance to see Friends in HD. It's hard to not buy it but when you see what is missing it will be easy to decide, believe me!One reviewer, paper tiger ""ariel august"", posted on a site showing every detail missing from this new set. After looking at it I will for sure not be wasting my money until they release the RIGHT one. Here's the site: uncutfriendsepisodes(dot)tripod(dot)com"
1,No extended episodes? I'm not buying!,"Why do these big companies do this to the fans. They won't sell to the real fans of Friends. We want the uncut episodes. The hd versions on tbs are fine to watch on tv but I was hoping for the uncut versions on blu ray, however, since Warner has confirmed these are the edited episodes I won't be buying them ever. Please put out what the fans want and not what some greedy company insists on giving us. You guys could have taken the time to do this the right way. So disappointing."
1,Extremely poor quality for Blu Ray,"Extremely poor quality, not meeting Blu Ray resolution at all.When you pause, you may see noise that is worse as DVD quality has.Picture quality changes from episodes or scene to scene.For example when chandler stuck in bank ATM branch, my cell phone does better job filming then that “Blu Ray”.When Friend went to hockey play, you are basically see worse TV version instead movie play, and so on.I think that version been made just to feed market request for Friends Blu Ray, but no remastering work been done at all.If you have DVD version don’t waste your money on it."
4,"The are the Broadcast Version People, not Syndicated!",Everyone seems upset and saying these are what you see on tv now! They are not they are the original ones we saw the very first time it aired..which is the ones that made us love Friends in the first place. Would i love the extended versions from the DVD's of course. But at least we are getting Friends with a much needed blu-ray upgrade(the first few seasons on dvd look horrible.) the way we first saw them. NOT THE EDITED SYNDICATED VERSIONS.
3,good movie..not enough sex lol,"heh..hi. this was a very good movie..i am not disappointed in any way really. only one thing..i expected a bit more sex or romance, especially between Murray Head and Peter Finch, as it was to be a controversial love triangle story. but alas...it was the 70s, and British tv also heh. guess just getting them to kiss onscreen was a breakthrough in those days. i wanted to buy the dvd, but the VHS quality was very good. will definitely watch again. thanks :)"
5,Location location location,"The film is quite dreary - a man trying to decide if wants to poke or be poked. But the location shots are suberb. Part of it is filmed in Pembroke Square, London W8, a gorgeous and very bohemian part of London. Definitely the place to be, live or be seen, or at the very least - have seen.Watch the film for the background footage alone - and don't pay too much attention to the ins and outs of the story - if you see what I mean."
3,Just letting you know,"The tracks that are included on this CD are the studio version of Papercut, a live version of Papercut, a live version of Points of Authority and the CD-Rom video for Papercut. I bought this single because I like live tracks, but it isn't very good. The live songs aren't very good and aren't that much different from the studio. My advice is to save your money. I hope you found this review helpful."
4,Excellant disc case @ a good price!,"The case was just a bit less rigid than I expected, but nonetheless a good quality product. Has served me well so far."
2,Flimsy,"This is a nice idea in theory, but the case material is not firm. It is molded to look like a hard case, but it IS NOT HARDCASE. Materials aside, the construction appears to be adequate. There is a zipper closure, and if that zipper busts, it's done. If you still want one of these, I recommend getting the single-stack (24) case, which might hold up better."
3,Flimsy Pages,"I wanted something I could keep in my car for just a few CD's, so the portability and heavy duty outer cover of this product were very appealing. I can only give three stars though because the pages are so flimsy. I wanted to get CDs in and out quickly while in my car and I can't. The weak pages fold and crumple easily."
1,Disappointed,"I just received the Case Logic 24 CD Heavy Duty Wallet CDE24. I am very disappointed in the quality of this product and I am returning it to Amazon, The CD sleeves are much too loose and the wallet itself is not ""heavy duty"" in my opinion. I am a classical music listener and some of my imported CD's are very expensive - heck, what CD is not expensive? Does anyone know of a better product?"
2,Flimsy sleeves,"Don't let this case fool you. It's outer case is ok, but the sleeves are very flimsy and cheaply made."
3,"I should have read the reviews, I was surprised that there was no handle","I made the mistake of not reading the reviews on this and was expecting that it had a handle, as the picture shows. Otherwise the size is good, I'm happy with the durability of the material it's made of and overall it is what I was looking for. Usually I can't go wrong with Case Logic, that's why I didn't take the time to read the reviews, though one shouldn't have to read the reviews to find out that the picture is misleading. I was specifically looking for a case with a handle so my 4 year old could tote some of his movies from the car to the house, etc. and instead I carry it for him."
4,I like this cd wallet,"I like this cd wallet a lot. what i like most is that it's nice to see 2 cd's each time i flip a ""page."" I like having room for 48 cd's in the wallet. i haven't had any scratching of my cd's. i would like it if the openings for the cd's were on the right side rather than at the top as i hold the case horizontally as i flip through. i've had it for about a month and it looks like i just got it, and it has been tossed around in my car a lot."
5,Very Functional,"This CD wallet was just barely big enough for the CDs to fit comfortably inside, not taking up any more space than it needs to. SInce it's so compact, it fits perfectly into my center console with plenty of room left over. The outside of it is hard, yet smooth and somewhat squishy. I don't feel like I need to worry about the outer shell cracking, but it's strong enough to protect the CDs inside. I'd recommend this CD wallet over many of the other big, clunky ones. This one is simple and functional, which is really what I need. Great product!"
5,Great quality item,After looking all over I found this CD Case at a great price and the features I wanted. Received it fast and I am very happy with the Case Logic Heavy Duty CD wallet. It's a good quality product. Thanks Amazon.com
4,Cd case,This was a gift for my husband who wanted a way to organized his CDs in the car this was perfect
1,Scratches and broken ziper,Nice case but arived with scratches and a broken ziper. Unfortunatly I won't be able to return it.I recomend only buying it if you have time to return in case a case like mine is delivered to you.
5,IT'S GREAT.,"I LIKE IT! IT'S a great holder for cd's. It's protective and durable, so much so I feel that I could run over it 5 times, and my cd's or dvd's would be protected. Hold's 48:)Not to much, not to little."
4,Movie storage case for road trips,"Well construted. Seem as if the DVD's will not suffer from scratches, DVD pocket backing appears that it is made to prevent that. Only time will tell. will not be removing the DVD all the time which helps."
4,OK!!,"It does what it is supposed to which is hold your cds/dvds in one place. That said, it is more medium duty as opposed to heavy, so if one is not too rough with their cases then this is the one because you cannot beat the price.So...."
3,WTF - NO HANDLE,I bought this since it had a handle in the picture and as soon as I ripped open the package there is no handle. NOT COOL !! other than the no handle part its a good cheap case for storing your cds/dvds
4,CD wallet,"I purchased four of these wallets for my barbershop quartet to keep learning CDs in. This works perfectly since one of our members has to change vehicles frequently because of children in her family, and this way, she doesn't have to leave her learning CDs in another vehicle; she can just grab the wallet and have her CDs with her in whatever vehicle she is driving. This helps the rest of us keep our music together, too. The product is sturdy and handy. I like it."
5,Great Case with Great Price,This is a real value. The sturdy case is well built and provides great protection and storage for your DVDs and CDs. Recommended.
5,Exceptional Zippered CD Wallet,"I like accessories that are functional and really work as they were intended and designed. Such is the case with this product. It holds CDs securely and safely. There is also room for accompanying booklets, manuals and the like. This CD Wallet is well thought out, functional and very durable."
3,Case Logic Case,I like the size and storage capacity. I was hoping the case would be a little more heavy duty. I wouldn't stack stuff on it. It is light weight and has a depression built in some what like a handle. It works for my needs. I have always bought case logic products and still like the style and layout as compared to cheaper brands.
3,This case is very small,"I purchased this because of the price, but it is much too small - switching to paper sleeves from now on."
3,Can get better,"Not worth the amount spent on this wallet, the envelopes which holds the CD are not very strong."
1,I hate this thing,"Frankly, I think this case sucks.Something about the design of the sleeves makes it nearly impossible to put CDs into the case one handed, which is something of a requirement for me while I'm driving on long trips.I realize that wanting to play actual CDs probably makes me something of a dinosaur, instead of just using an iPod or something, but still, it's the way I do things, and this case is ill suited for it.If you're just going to use it for transport, and will always be able to devote two hands to the task of putting CDs back in the case, this review is not for you."
4,Perfect for almost any Disk-based Media,This case holds Disks very well. There is a little pocket on the inside which I found to be a convenient place to store memory cards. Won Downside is that the sleeves do not hold mini-CD's or mini-DVDS well. The exterior is also very thick and feels like it would absorb most of the impact if you wear to drop the case.
5,Very nice and cheap case,"I was looking for a CD case, because I was running out of room in my old casesI came across this case, and it was pretty cheap in price compared to others.I decided to give it a shot and ordered 2 of them.I got them and liked them both very much. Very good value if your looking for cheap CD case and theres a lot of space to fill up.The outside is pretty durable, with rubber like skin. Will protect your CD's.The inside it also nice, has a built in pouch for some storage and the actual sleeves where the disks are stored good and wont scratch your CD's.Overall order this if you want a good cheap case with plenty of storage."
3,Not Bad,"The best 2 things about this product are the zipper and the outer shell. The outer shell feels like light weight ""carbonite"" or soft plastic. Sleeves are flimsy but do fit snug. Lightweight."
5,finally able to store all my cds,"Great CD wallet, the design is very nice and the feel of it is nice and well. Feels sturdy not cheap. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a decently priced CD wallet. a+"
3,No handle as shown in pic,I'm happy with the quality of the product. I'm not pleased that the cd case is described as to having a handle when it certainly does not.
4,Nice Case,"Good size, durable and holds discs - just like it's supposed to. The case smells bad though, no two ways about it. Hopefully smell will dissapate."
2,ITEM NOT AS PICTURED,The product is fine I guess but clearly the picture shows a handle which is why picked this particular case.The products I received didn't have a handle attached or as an accessory in the box.
3,"Not bad, not great","This was a decent purchase for the sale price, however it is not as sturdy as you would imagine it to be and there is no handle. It does the job and is not bad if you just want a mediocre case. If you need something strong and durable I would go with something else. Overall I am happy with it as I do not require heavy-duty protection and it fulfills its function."
3,Wouldn't really buy again,"Bought a large cd case to transport dvd's, cd's, etc in a solid durable cd case. The product looks nice and holds a fair amount of cd's, however the case isn't nearly as rigid as I am comfortable with. The case can bend in with a slight amount of pressure. If you need a seriously durable cd case I wouldn't recommend this product. Also, mine didn't come with a handle (not really a big deal but just thought I would add that)."
3,a pretty average cd case,"i was expecting something stronger and more durable. the online image of this product looks deceptively tough. it's not. it's very standard. if i had known it would just be a regular cd wallet, i would have saved myself some money by buying one at target."
2,No Handle,Disappointing to receive an item that does not look like the image. The case doesn't have a handle (which was the main reason I ordered it) and the rubbery smell makes you wonder what kind of toxic waste was recycled in the manufacturing process.
4,Exactly as advertised,"The outer casing is good, and protects my CDs. The sleeves fit the CDs well, and are also the perfect size for putting the booklets inside. This case is not bulky, but when I tried to put thirty CD booklets in the sides after I had filled all the slots, I was still able to close it, meaning that I can store my booklets inside the case as well as the 48 disks. This case has saved me a lot of space. I would definitely recommend this case to somebody looking for a convenient, stylish, and practical case for their CDs and DVDs."
4,Its good,"It looks good, the surface is a bit rubbery. The inside is common plastic film with felt inners. When it is nearly full, it will be a bit difficult to insert cds."
5,Perfect small travel case,We use it for our car. I like it because it is sturdy and holds alot of DVD's yet is compact. I love the material on the outside.. easy to clean.
5,Antec PRO 92mm Double Ball Bearing Case Fan with 3-Pin and 4-Pin Connector Review,"This is a great product. This fan keeps the computer cool by having a very fast fan speed! Compared to any other fan I have had, this is by far the best!"
4,Antec PRO 92mm Double Ball Bearing Case Fan,"This fan performs great and is quiet, I only wish it was a 3000 rpm fan but then it might not be quiet."
1,Quantum Notes,"Don't waste your time and money. Not worth half of the asking price. It's as though, the author's are so delighted in the success of their first works, they think they can compile and package any kind of garbage, call it a book and rely on their former success and names to sell it. I Could have given the money instead to my 8 yr. old granddaughter and asked her to explain and show me what she is learning in her accelerrated-learning classes in grade school and would have gotten much more info than what is in the pages of this pamphlet. Totally disappointed! A much better 'BOOK', is 'Learning Maps and Memory Skills' by Ingemar Svantesson. Another great one is 'Mindmapping' by Joyce Wycoff. Again,'DON'T BOTHER'!"
2,Quantum Notes- Is it worth it?,"I found this book to have a lot of good information for someone who has never experienced Quantum. If you know anything about Quantum Learning, though, it's just a review of VERY BASIC Quantum Notetaking Techniques. Good to have around to brush up on, I guess, for those who teach Quantum."
5,"Jagged Edge, Jagged Edge, Jagged Edge!!!!","I've heard many songs that I could relate to, but the songs on this cd outdo them all. I can imagine going through the situations and experiences this group sings about and every time I listen to Jagged Edge, it gives me chill bumps."
3,Beginners Gun,"Well, this is a good FIRST gun. The mag it comes with is VERY flimsy plastic. The spring it too strong, it take like 15 pounds of force to cock the gun. The muzzle will break off if you play too rough with it though. I got an extra clip because the one it comes with only holds 12 BB's. Over all, it's an OK gun."
3,ok,"This gun is okay I got it a few days ago and it goes pretty fast, it even cracked my target! If you open it up you'll see the company tride to make it heavey cheaply. In the grip there is a metal bar and in the middle there is a cement block. This gun is good for beginners because it has a lot of gadgets. The only problem is right away the laser light broke and with out the light the sights are junk my dad is fixing it so it should be okay. All in all this gun is okay, and really good for $10."
3,pretty good,its a good gun the clip is small the but stocks is also small and if you extend it all the way it is wobbly it comes with a nice laser and the sight is cheap and not good the cocking it is good but cheap but i love this gun day 2 iv had it and i just love it
4,advice:,"its a good buy. the red dot didn't sight didn't work, the laser wasn't working for a few days and then all the sudden worked really well! Don't look at the old comments, cause i believe they have made this gun less breakable. If you recieved it broken, it could be the people who drove the package to your house were careless. Don't drop the gun. Don't load the clip more than 3/4. Be EXTREMELY careful when you assemble the gun together. Expect problems. If you have problems, send airsplat a polite message about the problems your gun has. They are sending me a replacement and double accessories cause of the gun problems i had!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,It's OK but when I got it it would not cock back al the way so I pushed a real gun cleaner down the barell and it was clear again. Then a few weeks later I droped the gun on the ground and the stock fell off. The bb's get stuck in the chamber so every time you cock the gun all the bb's come out of the clip. My last words are DO. NOT. BUY.!!!!
1,Don't buy this gun,"When I bought this guns I bought it new but right off the start I knew it wasn't. When I read the instructions they didnt make the least sense. Sure it looks cool but I'll find it hard to believe u got it to work. when u put the bb's in the mag they all fall into a chambber in the back that dosent even have a link to the gun. The whole thing has a wierd system that is completely didfferent from ordinary guns. i couldnt even get the bb's in the actual gun, they all fall out of the mag. basically DONT BUY THIS GUN."
1,DOO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCEMSTANCES!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this gun as my second gun and its the cheapest chinese clone iv'e ever seen. I opened the box and it was broken in half. The gun is alllll plastic. Me and my friend were just unscrewing it for the parts and one of the screws broke! The gearbox has no metal, this sucks for u noobs out there who don't no about airsoft. And i was trying to fix it and the cocking spring broke in half. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GUN!!!!!P.S.Its like wasting money so just spend the extra 40$ on a semi good AEG (automatic electric gun)THANKS FOR READING!!!!"
1,damaged,i recieved this product it was damaged i have been calling this company the line is always busy i have emailed they returned 2 emails but nothing else i am stuck with this product i paid 25. dollars for!
1,It didn't work,My gun did not shoot for more than a week. It was a waste of my money and I feel bad.
1,i rock,this gun sucks. i bought it for 11.50 a year ago and im sure it still sucks and now they are are ripping people off for a gun that should not even be on the market and its made of a bunch of cheap sucky thin plastic and i dropped it on the grass and the stock completely broke off!!!!!! i wasted 12 bucks and you should not buy this gun it shot like ten feet when i first got it and they said it shot 370fps and now they have changed it to 200. NOT A GOOD BUY UNLESS YOU ARE STUPID AND LIKE CRAPPY GUNS
3,its not horrible,its ok but it doesn't shoot very far. Sometimes itll shoot more than one or two bbs but i dont care. Cocking is a little hard but not really. Also i disagree that it fells like the cocking device feels like its going to break. Its not very good but it works fine in close quarter combat
2,Not a good gun,First of all it took like 2 weeks for then gun to get to me. 2 weeks later....the piston broke so its not a high quality airsoft gun. But it looks cool and its worth the price.
2,THE GUN IN YOUR GENERATION,Don't waste your time on this gun i mean the plastic materials breaks very easy and not even super glue can fix it properly for some sort of made material.List of ways its Broken easly* The laser sight only has a duration of 6 hour use(high power battery will break the laser sight)* The scope on the xm8 is not even what you expected (cheap scope creation)* There's no flashlight shown in the picture* about 12 ounce weight to make the gun feel like a rifle (not even)* easy fragile material (when used hardcore)I gave it a 2 cause the model looks realistic not when it black but I wouldn't waste 30 dollars on a spring bb I mean get a better eletric gun for at least 45 buck but this gun will haunt you forever if you but it. YOUR CALL
3,Airsoft,OK first off don't expect to get a really good deal for your money on this item. I got this gun about a money ago for y birthday and it worked fine until I lost the pin kind of thing that keeps the BBS in the clip. I had jammed it once and I got it to work again.Point being this is a good airsoft gun for beginners (I am not a beginner I am a moderate player). list of Pros and cons.Pros:-Has good distance (about 30-40 feet)-easy to usereally light weightCons:-A pain to reload the clip (it is not a wind up kind of clip- It starts to fall apart in a bout a month (If it was used many times)- the clip it kind of cheap.In general the gun was good for about 1/2 of a month.P.S. I would recommend this gun for 9-11 year old kids or beginning airsoft players.
1,Boy XM8 Light Laser Spring Airsoft Rifle,"The original rifle we bought was very poorly packaged and was broken when it arrived, The product worked alright as far as the shooting of the gun goes but the laser part never worked. The seller sent a replacement gun and it worked fine for 2 days and then it completely broke too. You get what you pay for, this is a very cheap and poorly made gun."
1,HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY,DO NOT buy this gun.. it looks like a good gun but really is a peice of crap!! First impression of the way was the outside packing was in chinese and poorly written english! the whole gun broke within a matter of 5 minutes and never shot a bb.. STAY AWAY!!!
1,warning !! don't buy this piece of crap!! ITS FAKE-,"it doesn't work, the lazor doesn't work, it isn't and actual airsoft gun, i actually BROKE IT APART to see what was in side and it was completely hallow... It is a fake!! DO NOT BUY THIS. It says its electric, well it doesn't even COME with a charger. ya I cracked it open, guess what i saw. Not a battery but a bag filled with sand."
1,"not good, its bad",i bought and was shocked its flea market cheap plastic and its scope sucks it broke rite away and its accuracy sucks it is all plastic and over awhile it wasnt even using any bbs. it doesnt even deserve any stars
2,why did I buy this,It is OK for say a beginner but i air soft with my friends and I broke in 3 seconds. I was excited because I said it came with all these attachments. the only good attachment is the flashlight and i gave it to my brother. the laser pointer goes on to none of my other guns and its like 4 feet off. also the cross hears which were inside the sight look as though they were punched out.
1,bad gun.,"Okay first of all, this gun is bad. the stock broke after a day or two of having the gun. the the barrel with the orange tip broke on the third day. the light, when pointed at the ground,two feet away, (in the black of night) only makes a dim circle about 2 feet wide and 2 feet tall. at a distance of ten feet the laser is four feet away from the area you see through the scope.the mag does hold 100+ round, but every 10 rounds, you have to take the mag out then pull the spring down and then shake then mag. also, there are no peep sites. when the stock broke, i had to duct-tape the stock on, and it wouldn't work unless we took the sight off, so we had to shoot the gun with no sights at all. also the gun is louder then any airsoft i have ever heard before. and it has a lousy fps.DO NOT BUY THIS GUN!!"
1,Boy XM8 LED Light Spring Airsoft Rifle,Not worth the $6.50 - we could not get this device to fire a shot. The pellets got stuck in the barrel. Don't waste your time.
2,extremely slow for expedited shipping,i have not recieved this item and i ordered it on march 7th 2008. its been exactly 1 week and as i read in the track packages section it has not even been shipped
3,an ok gun,overall a cool looking gun not very accurate the laser is off by about 30 degrees the gun shot curves downward i would not recommend this for airsoft battles
3,Its alright,"it shoots decently, it has alright range. if you intend to use this indoors it'll be perfect. both of the other reviewers are dead on in their oppenions. its good for the price"
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD",Worst air soft gun ever. As soon as i shot this gun it jammed and the gun fell apart. Only buy this gun if you plan on giving it to a 6 year-old as a prank.....
2,DONT BUY!!,"do not buy this gun it is a waste of time and money its nothing like the pictures!! its very small, this is the kind of gun you would buy for an 8 year old."
3,Decent for the price,"I bought this gun not for airsoft, but to use in a prop for my short films. it looks nice and very close to the real gun. i dont know how well it would work in an airsoft battle and it feels kinda flimsy when loading it to fire, but for 10 dollars its not a huge loss. also the laser does not aim straight, at least the one i got with it. Overall if you are looking to use this in battle, i would proably go with a more expensive model, but for anything else its a great deal."
2,not very good,This bb gun was not very good the scope was broken the gun dosent shot good and i t breaks easy.
2,dont get this gun!,dont get this gun i bought this gun about 6 months ago and when i got it there was no scope the stock broke after a while and the plastic is really cheap the only good thing about this gun is probably the fps.
3,its desent.,it is good for the price. but you cant use heavy bullets or it jams. the tip breaks very easy when i bought my cousin was messing around with it and dropped it and the tip broke off. but it still works. it shoots pretty fast about 300 to 310.
3,Its an ok gun... Read on-->,"Well this gun is Powerful maybe 360 fps or so. Its smaller than some guns. Hard to cock. Its cool looking... Cheap magizine VERY CHEAP not well done at all...Pros.Good lookspowerfulacurate.Cons.CHEAP MAGSNOT EASY TO COCKSTOCK IT WORTHLESSover all rating is 50, 50."
1,worst gun ever,i lost my money its like a toy gun. dont buy this gun it is in chinese and the mag is fake so is the light
1,TEH WORST AIRSOFT GUN EVER!!!,"Do yourself a favor and put whatever money you would use to buy this gun towards something that actually works! THE ONLY 'good' thing that came with this gun is the laser sight.This is also KID SIZE!!!! Horrible accuracy as well! have to aim 1.5' above intended target in order to actually hit the target!Again, Save your money, buy something better!"
2,crap,i paid [...] bucks for tyhis gun got it and got it ready and figured out how it worksand after using it a few time si relized its flawsfirst its too damn smallits accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crapand doenst do squat in heavy battlesand the clip is a reduiclus system of shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystembuy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it
1,Do not buy!!!!,"This product is sub standard. After spending two hours trying to decipher the directions on Christmas day my son & husband came to conclusion that it is junk. The bullets don't load and if you manage to get some loaded it doesn't shoot. Furthermore, one of the lights never worked. The vendor is AWFUL. I followed instuctions & am still waiting for a reply on returning the item. They have a re-stocking fee and said if the item isn't returned within THREE DAYS there are no refunds...just a possible replacement with another model. To date I still have not heard from them. By the way their shipping charges are outrageous and I only ordered because it was very inexpensive and I assumed it was because they discontinued the model."
3,Nothing too scary here,"I tend to get all of these Mammoth titles as I like to read before I go to bed at night and the short story format is perfectly suited for that. Some of these stories are real sleepfests making you wonder why there were ever included in this anthology, for surely if they were the best I would loathe to read the ones that Jones rejected. There are some grade A stories here though ""gramma forever"", ""i have a special plan for this world"", and the ""other side of midnight"" leave a lasting impression on the reader. Still I must say I did not find the majority of stories all that scary, some were merely entertaining."
4,grow em right,"Good book, informative!One of about 3, needed to get a good handle on food plots, building habitat, in general information about improving your hunting property!"
4,Beautiful concert but the audio is not so good,"I enjoy watching this concert of Engelbert Humperdinck held at the London Palladium. He sang most of his old greatest hits. I like his rendition of the the song ""Still"" and "" Love Is A Many Splendoured Thing"". Too bad because this concert is only recorded on Dolby Digital 2.0. It would be much better if it is recorded on Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS because the audio of Dolby Digital 2.0 is not so very good."
2,Disappointed!!!,"I am a big Engelbert fan, but this dvd was very disappointing. His heart didn't seem to be in it. He did have a couple of good songs, and I enjoyed his daughter's performance. Part of the problem is that the band drowns out his voice in a lot of the songs. It's as if they slapped something together and therefore ended up with a product of very poor quality. I'd return it and get my money back if I could. I'd recommend ""Engelbert Live"" instead. That one is well worth the money."
5,Englebert Rocks!,"Hey Ppl,I wouldnt say i'm an Englebert humperdinck fan cause i just learnt about his music a while back.I heard this DVD at my cousins place and just loved the music n his voice.I'v seen this DVD around 20 times at my cousins place in a week(no kidding!) and i just had to have a copy of my own.If you like slow love songs and songs with good lyrics i recommend this DVD as a MUST HAVE! n TRUST ME U'LL LOVE IT!"
4,South African Reviewer CB,"Whilst Mr Humperdinck has grown old gracefully and seams to stil have the following, his voice and ability still remains to a large degree, the dvd is filled with the standard Humperdinck material and revised hits in a disco styled beat. I have always thought that he talks to much inbetween songs and should just get on with it, still in good voice but clever arrangements and much of the same power. Its a overall good buy and nice to have as it is pretty recent, 2001.Craig SA"
3,Engelbert Humperdinck - Live at the London Palladium,"Well, I expected more from Engelbert. I haven't seen him perform in a while, and I was disappointed with his performance in this DVD. The sound and picture quality is good. His voice was off several times, and I think he should of avoided the songs he can't really sing properly anymore......this show was rather boring - his movements are rather dead. There were a few good songs, with help from the band, but I frankly didn't carefor this show. Sorry."
1,Very light & very poor,"Many people and guns missing,Jeff Cooper,George A. Custer, Gen. George Patton, Charlton Heston, Robert Stack, Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood and many others.I lost my money"
4,Gunfighters,"This book is about 1/3 on old gunfighters of the old west and 2/3 on the ""B"" Western cowboys. It is interesting to read but you should realize it is mostly movies."
4,"Well Done, Roger!","Roger Waters tours after 12 long years and shows why he was one of the most important ingredients to the success of Pink Floyd. A great set list and loads of talent in his band made this tour and album a huge sucess. Everything from Floyd's back catalogue and Roger's solo stuff appear on this album. The songs are played very well and sound great. I gave this album 4 stars because you can definetly hear where David should have been. Sorry, Doyle and Snowy but noone can play those solos like David. This can really be heard on Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Dogs as there are notes being skipped or altered. The notes being altered don't belong. Otherwise if you like Roger and like Pink Floyd. I do recommend this album."
4,A Big Fan Slightly Disappointed,"Roger Waters is the greatest songwriter of all time, bar none, in my opinion.I wish I could give half-stars, as this one really deserves a 3.5. Since I can't, I give Rog benefit of the doubt.The sound mix on this album is terrible. I have obtained bootlegs from this tour that sounded almost the same.I saw the concert in Tampa last year, and aside from the mix the only other complaint I have is the same one I had about the show: the lip synching. Waters' voice obviously hasn't survived the abuse it took from all of his years of primal scream type singing (screaming). Every Stranger's Eyes is the worst example of this. It's so obvious that he's faking it, I can't believe him of all people trying to put one over on his fans.Still, the material stands up after all of these years. ""Each Small Candle"" is a feeble effort, but the rest is classic Waters/Floyd. You don't notice the absence of David Gilmour one bit."
2,dogs,Finally animals gets some respect hear it in 5.1 dolby youll like it. The other songs arent to bad either. Its great.
3,Roger Waters,"This album is okay to new pink floyd fans, but if you have Pulse, this is just a view of rogr's solo work."
1,Warning--mispackaged discs,"This didn't play in 5 different CD players. Discs are marked ""designed for use in Super Audio CD players only"" but the outside case doesn't say that. I think Sony mispackaged this. We'll try to exchange for the correct format."
3,"Only if you have seen the show,you can relate to this album","The music is great but one needs visualization to appreciate the material on this album. Missing is the great guitarist, David Gilmour."
3,"A great effort, but not perfect...","I didn't attend any of the recent tour shows, but was able to pick up a video boot of one of the shows from '99, and I must say that although the tunes are executed impeccably, I can't give this 5 stars due to the 'Gilmourish' tendencies of the hired tour guns Mr. Waters has. Call me a purist, but Mr. Gilmour himself should've been up there on stage. The spirit may not have been marred so much if Roger didn't slide in a slanted comment about 'the other band'. I was under the impression that his reconciliation with members of 'that other band' was authentic. Yes, I do have a healthy respect for Mr. Waters' creativity, but let's not really forget who helped him get there. I also would've seen the show if it wasn't billed so much as a 'back-catalog' event; I think his excellent solo material could just as easily fill up 2 discs. Worth a listen, but beware the dog who calls himself 'Pink'..."
5,Roger Waters In The Flesh Live,"Excellent!! As usual, Roger and Co. bring it all back home. It sure would be nice to have heard Gilmour playing the leads though. Well, some dreams come true, some not. Buy this record and add it to your Floyd, er uh, Waters collection. Sure is nice to hear SOMETHING recent."
5,"Like Pink Floyd, it gets better with each listen.","Wonderful 2-disc set by the principle genius behind the music of Pink Floyd. Must have been a killer live show to see in person. The liner notes hint of a DVD release, but I'm unable to find any street date release info. Former Arc Angels member Doyle Bramhall II, son of Stevie Ray Vaughn's chief songwriting partner Doyle Bramhall, covers vocals on ""Money"" and makes it his own. The 16+ minute ""Dogs"" justifies the purchase! I am a fan of both the Waters-era Pink Floyd and the post-Waters Pink Floyd, but ""In The Flesh Live"" is a painful reminder of how good we music fans had it when Pink Floyd were in their heyday. Great CD!!"
4,Something for Every One . . . Floyd fans that is.,"I saw three of the shows from Roger's last tours, and this album is better quality than I expected. If you are a Floyd fan who had any appreciation for Water's lyrics, you will love this album. The guitarists stepped it up and sound really good. I think Waters does a great job with the Pink Floyd songs, and as others have said it was surprising to hear him sing Time. The album has a ton of music, and the solo work is getting better. I am glad Roger has finally convinced himself that Amused to Death was a good album. The best performance is Perfect Sense, very impressive, and the crowd was in awe. Comfortably Numb has a good finish. Not a Pulse finish, but you cannot expect that. Buy this, and grab Amused to Death as well."
2,Comfortably...Numb,"For us casual fans this is a mixed bag. The Water's solo material serves as a nice overview of his solo career (Each Small Candle is a highlight). But the inclusion of so much Floyd material is disappointing. Sure, Roger created most of the Floyd songs, but do we really need another live version of Comfortably Numb? And nearly the whole ""Wish You Were Here"" album is presented. A nice one disk set with his solo material would have been preferable. Yeah Roger...we know ""which one is Pink"". Enough already..."
4,Waters is Alive and Well!,"I'll start by saying I've never been a big fan of 'live' recordings. The sound quality is often inferior and the crowd noise is distracting. Not so with ""In the Flesh"". The crowd noise is mostly only heard between songs and never distracts the performance. The sound quality is better than many studio recordings. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of missing material from Radio K.A.O.S., one of Waters' finest efforts. These performances are arranged just differently enough to add a different approach to listening, but retains much of the integrity of the original recordings. Some fine old favorites from the ""Floyd"" days as well as some stellar work from Water's solo career. I was skeptical about getting this 2 CD set, but now I'll never part with it."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzz......,"The one star is for Dogs and Set the Controls.. The four ""missing"" stars are for: 1. The ""dull"" sound of the album 2. Lip sync during ""Every strangers eyes"" 3. Choice of songs, it's fun to hear some old ""Pink"" songs but not the ""same old same old"" all the time. 4. Lack of a concept, since each album since ""Dark"" has been a concept album why not tell at least one of these wonderful ""stories"" live? Amused to Death re-arranged would have been nice.... This album simply has nothing new to offer and the boring soundscape created is a sleeping pill. They should have left it ""un-produced"", the bootlegs off the tour are more satisfying."
2,A real let-down,"If you are a Pink Floyd fan, go listen to Dark Side, Animals, and the Wall again, and leave this album on the shelf. That Waters uses mainly women to sing Gilmour's parts is a disgrace. His attempts at Pink Floyd songs fall flat, and his solo stuff is fair at best. I deeply respect Waters as an artist, but only when he sings with three other guys. I was excited when this album came out. Sadly, I'm disappointed."
5,This is Pink Floyd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have been a Pink Floyd fan since 1970. I love Pink Floyd and Roger Waters. This album is the best so far. This is greeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!!!!!!!!When i hear the new Pink Floyd i think;what the f... is this.This is Pink Floyd(the real)!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Really bad. Roger used to be cool.,"I hate artists who feel a need to play their old material without reuniting their old band. Even if Roger Waters reunited with Pink Floyd, they would still be awful, because they would only play the crap from Dark Side of The Moon and The Wall. Sadly, that's the material Roger Waters chose to play. I'm not a big fan of those albums, but Roger Waters felt the need to put 80's guitar solos in such classics like ""Welcome To The Machine"" and put a saxaphone in ""Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun,"" which automatically makes it a turd-fest. Plus, add some female backup singers to just about EVERY song, and you have In The Flesh. Don't bother with this album. Get Ummagumma for true Pink FLoyd live, or just stick with the Live at Pompeii DVD."
1,CD's?????????????,"I gave it a 1 because it is a CD. Forget these CD's. Forget all CD's. The format along with stereo is dead. It's around 20 years old now and is showing its age. Buy the DVD instead. You won't believe the difference and it's cheaper in this case...Don't invest in old technology and inferior sound. The video enhances the surround audio which is spectacular in comparison to the CD. A stereo CD is like listening to a hockey/baseball game on the radio (what's a radio?). Why do that when you can have better sound with video added? Come on gang, embrace it. Why not watch Susanah Melvoin rather than just listening to her! I'm almost 50 and at this point, I want the best. This isn't it"
4,Great bottle bag!,"This bag is perfect for carrying 4 small or 3-4 large Dr. Brown's bottles and a jar or two of baby food. For the price, you can't beat it!"
4,"Great, but DOES NOT CONTAIN THE EXTRA TOTE, as pictured","If this item was shipped as pictured, this would be a 5-star review. However, this item only contains the big bottle cooler. The big bottle cooler works well and keeps my son's bottles cold for 8 hours at a time. I purchased this item because it was shown with the bigger cooler and the single bottle tote. I tried to resolve this with customer service, but they did not fix the problem. I am happy with the product, but a little disappointed because I would also like the single bottle tote."
5,Great!,I wish I had this bag with my last child. It's great! Although I use the skinny Medela bottles to pump in & can fit four-five in the bag. I'm glad I bought it.
3,Good bottle bag,this bag can fit 3 4oz bottles comfortably and squeeze in 4 4oz bottles if you place the ice pack on top. I haven't tried using any bigger size bottles with this bag. I like the look and design of this bag. where you see the pink line is basically also another pocket to place miscellaneous things but you really can't place too much since it'll affect what you can place inside the bag. This bag is just for a mini outing not for a long trip.
5,Great Bag,"Great bag for transporting pumped milk to and from work every day. It is sleek and slim but large enough that it can hold multiple bottles or storage bags. Comes with a cooler bag, which can be frozen and used many times. The first bag that I ordered came with the cooler pack leaking, but I sent it back and it was promptly replaced. It's cuter than the cooler bags that come with the typical Medela and Similac and other baby kits -- with a color accent, either baby blue or pink. Pumping every day at work can be grueling, and it's the small things that can add a hint of fun to your day...."
3,Good concept. Needs to be taller,"I like the bag, but you can't zip it with 8 oz. Brown's bottles in it. I need to take 3 bottles and 2 baby foods to daycare, and that will not remotely make it in this bag. However, the bag is narrow too, which is great for carrying the small medela bottles that you pump milk into which have a tendency to leak."
3,Not big enough,"Fine quality but doesn't fit four of the Born Free glass bottles (5 oz), fits three nicely."
3,A litte small,Bag is a little small. I can only fit 3 bottles instead of the 4 in it but it does serve its purpose.
3,Not ideal unless you need to transport 4+ bottles,"This cooler is fine if you need several bottles, but if you just need 1 or 2, look elsewhere. Now that our baby is older she only needs one bottle for most outings, so the bottles just tip over and leak in the cooler bag. You could put several ice packs in to hold them in place but that just adds to the weight. I have stuffed a dish towel in there to hold the bottle up but again, but it's really just too big for one or two bottles. This would have been great for a newborn who needs multiple bottles a day but for older babies, not so much."
4,J.L. Childress Diaper Bag Cooler,Great item! Only fits 3 nine oz Avent bottles though. (Including ice pack). Keeps cool for many hours. Happy with product.
3,Holds onto odors!,"We bought this product to replace our medela nursing set bottle holder, which was square in shape and taking up too much space in our diaper bag. We had been using the medela bag intermittently for the last 18 months (slow to change.) The new bag seemed to fit our bill perfectly. It fits well in the diaper bag, holds a sippy cup full of water and an 8 oz bottle of milk, as well as the included freezer pack without a problem. The items will definitely stay cold for a few hours.We took it on a long trip with us...and at some point forgot about some milk in the baby's bottle in the bag. It spoiled, and subsequently the bag smelled like the spoiled milk. We were travelling, and washed the bag out with soap and water in the hotel, without luck. On returning home, we soaked the bag in lysol and water...and now the bag smells like spoiled milk and lysol.Beware!"
2,Slightly below room temp cooling,"I've been using this bag for months because of it's shape and cleaning ease, but it's ability to keep cool is sorely lacking. I use two cooling units inside the bag and if anything, cold items get warmer while in it. It's an attractive bag and very easy to clean but the main purpose was for keeping cold things cold. Four hours later, there isn't much difference in cooling than if the item were sitting on my desk. Looking for a new bag..."
2,4 bottles? I think not...,"I was really excited to get this item as I send 4 bottles to my daycare providers everyday, and I thought it would snap right onto the side of my daughter's diaper bag for easy travel. Ummmmmm, I'm not quite sure why they advertise that this thing can fit 4 bottles, because I fit 3 (8 oz) EXTREMELY TIGHTLY and then once I added the ice pack there was NO POSSIBLE way to close it. Not to mention if you have wide neck bottles; (like Avent, Born Free, or Dr Browns) good luck. I tried my NUK bottles too without success. The only ones I could fit in there were the 4 oz bottles, and only 3 with the ice pack; it was still so tight I nearly busted the zipper off trying to close the darn thing! Anyway, I'll save it for a rainy day and hope that some other use comes of it. I definitely would have bought something else had I known, I'm pretty bummed."
5,simple leak free bottle holder,"Doesn't leak, snapping handle is handy and includes an ice pack. Holds 2 or 3 bottles conviently and keeps them cold without leaking. Not much more to say, simple product that does what it's expected."
2,"Ok, but I wouldn't re-purchase","This was great for about 6 months but then the inside ripped and the cool packs that came with it leaked. I haven't been heavy handed with it, so maybe mine was a duff one but I wouldn't repurchase this again."
3,Mediocre adaptation of a great short story,"Robert Coover's 1969 short story ""The Babysitter"" (included in his ground-breaking collection ""Pricksongs and Descants"") is a masterpiece of postmodern short fiction. The beauty of the story was its ambiguity and the way truth and fantasy seamlessly blended into each other until the reader is left completely unable to discern between reality and fantasy.While this film adaptation blends the characters' fantasies with reality, it ultimately settles on a solid reality for its ending.The other problem that many viewers may have is that there really isn't a whole lot that happens in the film, and while this is directly from the story, it doesn't make for much of a cinematic experience.Ultimately, this is probably for two groups of people: hardcore Alicia Silverstone fans (her performance in the film is decent) and hardcore Robert Coover fans (there have to be some others out there). Other than that, this film doesn't have much to offer."
2,Pretty disappointed,"After watching Clueless and falling for the looks of Alicia Silverstone, I thought I'd try out some of her other stuff. I have to say that as much as I like her, the film was pretty bad. The storyline was terrible and the acting was pretty poor. I only recommend watching this to get a look at Alicia, but if you want a good movie, go elsewhere."
3,"A pretty good movie, if you want to see Alicia","This movies not to bad if you have nothing else to watch and you like Alicia Silverstone. The plot is not good, and the acting is worse. The only bright spot in the movie is Alicia. But that's just my opinion. You can see the movie and form your own."
2,sexy movie,I love Alicia Silverstone but this movie was a little boring and too sexual not entertaing or funny I didn't understand why everyone on the movie wanted to sleep with her!
2,An ok movie,"I bought this movie because of Alicia, and because she is in it, I like it, though the movie isn't all that good."
4,ALICIA ALWAYS WORTH WATCHING,Alicia fanatics (I am one) find her always easy to watch because of her looks but also for her first rate acting ability.I thought the movie was hilarious. J. T. Walsh. George Segal and Lee Garlington (especially her) portray how foolish people their age act.The directing and editing are first rate.
3,seduced by the sitter,"good movie with some ok twists and turns. Nicky Katt, the one who gets hit with the car at the end is great. though Jeremy London seems misplaced but Alicia Silverstone is great in the imagination. though it lags but it's older cast."
4,Alicia need I say more,"We watched, We stared, then we started to take another breath again. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the story line and the parts that alicia wasn't in. And thats the bottom line."
3,Jeremy London and Alicia Silverstone are good:,"The movie is not the best as writing and plot is concerned,but I am a big Jeremy London fan and watching him is great...Alicia is also a very talented young actress and is good too...This movie isn't for viewing to often..THe story is twisted..."
3,Everything from Alicia acceptable,"Yes, Alicia is the best teengirl over all the world. from the movie you get nothing as story to remmber or good effect from the dirctor but comparing with these things you can get Alicia body, Pictures and good face."
2,Not too cool.,"I'm sorry, but I seen the movie and it sucked! It was pretty grose when the guys were all fantasizng about the baby sitter(alicia silverstone), and the mom was fantasizing about some other guy. And also the ending was pointless. I don't reccomend anyone to watch this one, unless if you like sick movies like that. END"
1,UGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!,"I can't even begin to tell anyone NOT to waste your money on renting this movie. I bought it because I enjoy Alicia Silverstone, but after seeing this movie... I have to wonder.Plot was beyond stupid, the fantasy scenerios that they play throughout the movie was soooo irrating. Every Male in the city WANTS ""The Babysitter"" and every person in this movie periodically go off into their own Fantasy world, which does not help the process or flow of the storyline.They really could have made this into a better flick without the two boyfriends, the drunken couple and ""The Babysitter"" (who it seemed to me forgot how to act)By the time the film was over I was so utterly frustrated that I had spent money on this one, that even the ending was the best part..... IT WAS OVER"
2,"Mommy, mommy, don't let her stay","A very interesting idea. A babysitter who is so attractive that she influences erotic fantasies in everyone she meets. But when the daydreams turn into nightmares at the expense of a life, the party's over. Good execution of a good idea is spoiled by the music. The score is just so utterly innopropriate for a movie like this, that is drags the whole thing down to pit level. And Silverstone's character also metamorphesizes in the end, doing a complete 160 degree that no one was expecting. The moral: Don't drink a drive, kids."
3,Young Alicia is cute and great looking here.,"Alicia gives and takes it away, those looking to see Alicia will see some of her but she wears a towel in the bathtub and there is nothing to see but those legs and eyes. The kid things of it with Alicia, I say get a life."
2,see-through skirt and boots.,Alicia in a see through skirt wearing boots is the only reason why I watched the stupid picture. What a body. Reminds me of Eleana Dokic the tennis player from Yugo only 19 bur with a slammin rearend!
2,For the Silverstone Fans Only,"There's really not much to the plot in this one, but that dosen't really matter cause Alicia's the main attraction. The acting is bland and uninspired, but that's irrelevant, Alicia is the star here. Basically, what i'm saying is - for true fans of Alicia Silverstone, this is a great movie; for the rest of you, don't bother with it."
2,"Quite the fatty, and can be a hazard","While it isn't a bad looking bird, when finished the Renegade has packed on enough poundage to make getting it to clear the pad an iffy proposition. I saw one fly this past weekend. It launched and staged fine, but while the sustainer performed its duty well, the booster section rolled over and came in ballistic. It landed in the moist grass with a heavy smack and it took some effort to pull it out of the ground. While I realize that cardboard and plastic aren't normally thought of as a peril, the booster section would have hurt had it hit someone on re-entry."
2,Not one of the better books in the series,"While it starts off well with a duel and a rousing battle, ""Sharpe's Revenge"" gradually develops into an unusually morose entry in the Sharpe series. I particularly disliked the unpleasant turn it took with Sharpe's wife, and it doesn't help that Sharpe seems to betray an old friend. The plot also feels somewhat contrived and farfetched, even for Richard Sharpe. There's a very clever twist involving a light artillery piece at the book's climax, but the denouement felt perfunctory and unconvincing. This isn't my least favorite novel in the Sharpe series (that would be the equally morose and even more farfetched ""Sharpe's Prey""), but it's far from one of my favorites."
2,Sharpe Reveals His True Self,"After reading the previous twenty books in historical order, I didn't think that stabbing a friend in the back and hiding from problems were 'Sharpe-esque' qualties, but now I guess they are. My opinion of the main character is permanently diminished."
4,If you like classic blues give this a listen,"Topper and his band cover classics with a hint of modernism and urbanity. The band is tight and Topper's harp is as good as it gets. The original song ""Long Way From Home"" shows the potential of Price as one of the greats. Topper Price lived for his music and you can hear that in this collection."
4,Perfect present,I ordered this for my husband. I had tried looking for it in all the local bookstores with no luck. I found several places to order this book from as part of his Father's Day present.
5,Continues where Diplomacy of Wolves left off. Wonderful.,"This is the second in the Secret Texts trilogy and takes off where Diplomacy of Wolves ends. Focusing on the rebirth of a prophet and the plan of the long dead Dragons, a group of destructive magicians, to again rule the world, the twists are many and the action great. The Sabirs figure greatly in both sides of the battle, and Kait learns more about her Karnee abilities. Again the magical system is wonderfully complex and the consequences make magic anything but mundane. I could not put this book down, and can't wait for the next installment of the trilogy. Lisle has increased her skills as a writer over the years, adding to her natural talent as a story teller. Great characters, original settings, a winner."
4,Even Better Than the First,"The second book of The Secret Text trilogy picks up right where the first one left off. Kait Galweigh is stranded on an island with her friends with the Mirror of Souls in their possession. Kait is mistakenly led to believe that the Mirror will restore the lives of her family. In addition to being stranded on an unknown island, Kait and her friends are also in great danger from the Sabir family. Crispin Sabir believes that the Mirror of souls will give him incredible power and immortality and will do anything that he can to get his hands on it. In actuality, the Mirror contains the souls of the Dragons. The Dragons were evil sorcerers that had ruled the world long ago. Kait and her friends must stop an apocalyptic war that is prophesied to occur when the Dragon's are released from their captivity. Holly Lisle does a wonderful job of giving her characters life and weaving her plots together. This book is captivating."
2,"Slow, mediocre printing","I bought this out of necessity while on a trip. It doesn't print very attractively, and it is much slower than my regular printer that cost a bit more. Unless you have a tight budget ceiling, I'd suggest springing for a more expensive printer. (I haven't tried printing photos, so cannot say how they might look.) Be warned, it doesn't come with a USB cable."
3,From the back of the book . . . .,"A Russian courier is shot and killed in Helsinki. His last words: ""A letter from Anna."" The mysterious message leads CIA investigator Jack Horn into a dark web of startling truths: a clandestine love affair. . . a plan for defection . . . a murderous betrayal . . . and worse -- a devastating scandal of international proportions."
1,it's quite the book,I read this book twice and really hated it It is way off of what expected. I don't recomend this book because i thought it was boring
5,I LOVE THIS SONG!,i love this song! it is soooooo awesome! it rules! u should really buy this cd becuz this is an awesome song!
5,It wasn't me,"We all love this song. My daughter would like to get it on cassette. haven't been able to locate one. matter of fact, all the stores around here are totally out of even the cd ""HotShot"" Does the single come on cassette?"
2,Fair advertising,"This is probably a great book for alot of folks, but if you aren't Christian, don't bother. The Knot Wedding guide book has more to offer EVERYONE than this book."
4,BIG BAND BEBOP,"If you like big band bebop this is the album for you.I'm not going to even try to give you the names of every guy in the band, but a few names will tell you the quality of this jazz outing. Kenny Burrell, Ray Brown, Plas Johnson, Harry ""Sweets Edison, Urbie Green, etc.Bebop was never popular. ?That's the truth of it. It is alive in Europe, & most of the rest of the world, like Japan, Australia & Russia, people are reaLLy into it.The heyday of bop was 1941-1955 & really started at Mintons supper club in Harlem. You either like it or you don't. I'm not trying to convert anyone to bebop, as opposed to ""swing"" like Benny Goodman"" & those really popular big bands.The tunes I liked best were ""Air Mail Special,"" ""A Child is Born,"" ""Don't get around much Anymore;""(Ellington) ""Lover"" & a few more. But truthfully, I enjoyed every tune on the album. You will also."
5,a royal winner,"Sigh...don't you just love stories about far away kingdoms and a hunky royal ruler? This one's for you, then. Add a mysterious fog, a kennel full of royal canines and -- oh yeah! -- passion and love and it adds up to one thing: this one's a keeper."
1,Warning Don't buy,Book refers to non-existent files on the included CD. Without these files the explanations are fairly worthless.
3,Clsoe to being grreat but . . .,"The premise of this book is that you will learn by doing. The only problem is that you can't do that because the examples/ aren't on the CD. As an addtional problem, the software that is supposed to calibrate your monitor is also among the missing. Maybe the CD is for an earlier orlater edition but it makes the process very frustrating. Frustrating because the book is very well written and quite comrehensive. And you must have a book if you are to learn this very involved convuluted, if very useful, application."
4,EGR Bug Schield for 2004 Ford F150 XLT Super Cab,The instructions were pretty good. It took me a little while to figure out how to get the grill off the hood of the truck which took the longest time.
3,a interesting read,"This book has been around a long timeand it was worthwhile rereading. Hard toget into but once one does, a goodread."
2,dull,"I'm not finishing this book. It,s just really boring and odd. I guess I should have read a sample and would not have ordered it."
2,Painful read,"If you feel you have to read this book, by all means listen to the audio version rather than read the print edition. The audio narrator interprets the most egregious of the lead character's painful baby talk. (an Amazon's audible.com audio book)The two lead characters are painfully flawed and dysfunctional and their abuse, particularly by the father, continuously ladled out to the children is painful and ever present.There is no redeeming value to this story and its characters. It only gets worse, shattering one's hope that things must certainly improve. I finished it based on some of the reviews here, but I wish I had never wasted my time at all with it.The ending is only mildly satisfying."
5,"Thank you, Jonathan Franzen","I read 30-40 novels a year and will say roundly that ""The Man"" is deeply satisfying. Most novels fail to resolve the complications they create, and this includes the ones that I very much enjoy for other reasons such as the author's digressions. This novel does not have intellectual additions or asides: it has one consistent theme which leads to a great resolution. Nothing interferes with the story's advance, but there are sections that could have been shortened. By contemporary standards it is a long novel which could have been made tighter with the omission of 50-100 pages. I award 5 stars because it is entertaining and cathartic. It reads quickly so the 500 pages are no problem. Don't read the introduction until after reading the novel as knowing the ending ahead of time never increases interest in a story."
1,Practically unreadable,"The characters in this book are fascinating, but the prose is a terrible chore to read. The father, for example, talks constantly in baby talk to his kids. Here's a quote:""Now we'll have to work up a schedule. And fustest, you must write to your pore little Sam ebbly week and tell how 'tis tuh hum; and second, you must keep a record of the birds and hanni-miles wot visit Tohoga House...""Maybe you can read that for hundreds of pages, but I can't. I ended up just skipping the passages where the father speaks to his children.Stead's most common strategy for character development is for her characters to give long lectures out loud (either to themselves or to an audience), and these lectures are tedious and repetitive.And finally, if you do get the book, don't read the introduction by Doris Lessing until you're done with the novel. Apparently the publisher decided it was all right to provide an introduction that gives away key events in the story."
2,typeface is illegible,"Can't review the book as art because the book as product has such an awful typeface it's a mean chore to read. I read daily and this is the most difficult typeface I've come across in at least a year, perhaps 2.Recommend purchasing some other edition."
5,Super,"I had only heard one of the songs on this CD before, so everything was new to me. There isn't a song I don't like. Some really stick in your mind and you are signing it all day. Very diverse collection and worth getting."
3,Great Amazon Seller,"Shipping was fast, and the item arrived on time! I thought i would love the songs on the cd but unfortuanatly its not my taste. More of an Enchantress listener"
4,A Magical Journey Through the Tapestry of Pagan Music History,Upon listening to this CD; I fell in love with many of the tracks. My favorite being We Do Not Die. There are many tracks on this CD that give the listener a very interesting survey of the diverse nature of the evolving nature of Pagan/Wiccan music. Many of the selections have most likely been used by individuals as well as groups to enhance their own ritual experience. I truly thank the many artist who are represented on this CD for having put musically the multitude of expressions it is to be Pagan.Christopher H. Merrell
3,So so,"Some of the songs are good, but I got a bad taste in my mouth with the first few songs. There seemed to be a lot of angst in them. I think pagan music should be spiritual and about how we celebrate, not about how it's us versus them. There is enough of that negativity out there elsewhere.For a truly beautiful and spiritual CD try ""Goddess Chant"" by Shawna Carol."
4,Nice variety,"I like a lot of songs on this cd. It has quite a bit of favorites that us witches like to sing. Some of the song writers are not as good as I would like, but it is their music and needs to be appreciated for what it is. You get good variety here."
1,My Ferrets don't like this,Mine hate this thing. they struggle with it and it tightens like a noose! Very difficult to loosen on a panicked ferret. Too loose and they houdini right out of it. All 3 of mine had problems with it.
1,Didn't fit,It was way to uncomfortable to wear and I think the sizing is a bit small. Returned item with fast response.
1,I want to rate it even lower,"I bought the PAL version from Amazon UK some time back and thought it was a good product initially. subsequently i realised adaptec released this product just to show there presence in A/V market as the support for this product is pathetic, price in unreasonable and most of all apart from bundled crappy software no third party software vendors support it. you cannot even upgrade the bundled windvr to the new retail version. I use to think adaptec products are good but not anymore. so buyers beware of this."
2,Digital Media User,"Having recently bought adaptec's ""Media-Center"", I have found it somewhat difficult to work with and disapointing. Several problems are evident when trying to record from TV feed as mentioned in some of the reviews for this product.As if that wasn't enough of a problem , I also found out after contacting customer service that one can ONLY use the device w/ the two provided applications that come bundled with the package. Indeed very limited in my opinion especially for such an expensive device.For all parties interested: I suggest just using a firewire/i.link cable if camcorder/camera supports it. Windows automatically and usually detects your device. Also, there are cheaper capture devices if all you need is to capture from a device except TV. As far as software, I've found that windows movie maker is a lot easier to work with and it worked best for my case. Good luck to all of you on your purchase!"
1,Adaptec - not suitable for use- audio sync problems,"I regret having this device for video capture purposes. After about 20 minutes, the audio gets out of sync w/ video. Gets worse the longer the capture. I have a new IBM ThinkCenter w/ 512 meg RAM.Consider yourselves warned."
3,Not up to the hype,"It seems I always get suckered in by the distributors product reviews and as usual it the same 'ol same 'ol. I believed , because it was done the early 80's, I would see something that the newer travel tapes had not shown. I guess I am jaundiced, I would not buy it again."
5,Before the breakup...,"This is, as far as I'm concerned, the last Human League album. What came after under that name, when compared to the groundbreaking synthpop on this (and the previous but not as strong ""Reproduction""), is very watered-down, by comparison. True, it sold better, but in this case, sales don't equal quality. What's here is some of the finest synthesizer pop out of Europe, easily in the same ranks as Kraftwerk or Jean-Michel Jarre. And the lyrical sensibilities here surpass even those: a little story about a record that 'swallows all the charts', an ominous look into urban/suburban hostility and paranoia, a scathing indictment about the disappearance of radio that 'really mattered', and so on. For those who think the high water mark of Human League comes with ""Dare"", get this and be prepared for a shock!"
5,"As long as Philip Oakey is here, it's still the Human League","I wasn't sure what to expect since I knew that the band at this time was not a pop dancing band, and was a more pre-Tarantino kind of style, but I felt reassured when I heard Being Boiled. When I got the album, I was more satisfied than I expected! It was still a rock kind of music you could dance to, but a little more darker with the lyrics and synthesizers; they are still the same Human League I know, just a different style of them, but still deep down, still the Human League they turned out to be. Some of the most favored songs on Travelogue is ""Life Kills"", ""Rock n' Roll/Nightclubbing"", and ""Gordon's Gin."" Whether or not this album was remastered, I would still have loved it! But the great thing is this album is remastered with six extra tracks! Overall, it was a great CD!!!"
1,What a Stinker !,"This movie is awful.Sound quality wasn't very good, video quality was mediocre to poor, the story line was garbage, the characters were pathetic or disgusting, the acting was so sad.This movie is one of the lamest I've seen in my life. It wasn't worth the time I spent watching it. I regret paying $2 for this turkey. Now, I can't sell it 'cause I don't want to screw the next person.Ursula looks pretty good, and one scene where she's tied up while two girls rub her down with oil was erotic, but it sure didn't make up for the rest of this clunker.Go find something else to spend your money on."
3,Good Valu to Buy,"This book contains a lot of good photos. And the explanation is very good! If you want to know much about the art of sex,you should not forget this one!"
4,Courageous,"Gary Griffin's book deals sensitively with a controversial subject. It is written with confidence and flair, and the fact that the author is now permanently locked in a figure 8 after one particularly strenuous session is a tribute to his courage. Unfortunately, not everyone agrees. When asked what he thought of the book during a recent interview on 60 Minutes, my friend Hugh Grant shrugged dismissively and said, ""What do I think of 'The Art of Auto-fellatio'? Let me put it this way. It's a bit like calling astrology a science. Since when has receiving it in a car been considered an art? And the broad I got caught with was no oil painting either.""Don't swallow what one critic has to offer. Read the book and make up your own mind."
1,Complete scumbag,"Why would anyone be willing to support this man in anyway? He is a pure scumbag, who pretends to be driven by a moral compass. His career shows his ""moral compass"" constantly points in the direction of profiteering, criminal activity, and striping the rights of Americans to support his constituents."
1,He SHOULD run for president.,"For all his ""aristocratic forebears"", Bill (the most notable scion) comes across as a shifty, nervous, unconvincing good ol' boy hustler. Perhaps he was found by the side of the road. Unfortunately for his political ambitions, he is unable to suppress the facial evidence of his frequent prevarications and downright falsehoods. Perhaps he's a little more intelligent and consequently self-aware than our present ""leader"", who apparently views himself as the popular captain of some giant prep school football team. So nothing but good things can come to our nation by Bill's thrusting himself forward; we'd really have to take a hard look at the voting machines if he won. As for the rest of this noble clan, ""behind every great fortune lies a great crime""."
1,scary that this is actually for sale!,I thought for sure this book was a joke. Scary to see its not!!I would say in the book's defense though that it is a great testament to how someone can be so full of themselves and the power that they've acquired that they completely lose touch with reality.
1,A monumental bore-a-thon,"Really, this has got to rank as one of the worst excuses for biography ever written. So Bill Frist's family is supposedly melanin-free... so what? Is that their sole claim to being ""good people""? What else have they done to justify these hundreds of pages of poorly written prose? The only positive benefit of this yawn-inducing snoozathon is that it's a surefire remedy for terminal insomnia. You'll be bored into a coma in no time at all."
1,he left out a couple of things.,"How to be an inside trader, how to whine like a crybaby when he doesn't get his way. Oh and his video diagnosis technique."
3,Do Good People Beget Lying Insider Traders?,"Do Good People Beget Lying Insider Traders?, September 24, 2005Reviewer: Maezeppa (California) - See all my reviewsThis book bears further scrutiny based on the recent revealations Frist dumped vast amounts of family stock just ahead of the plunge. Frist is on the record denying being in possession of any prior knowledge about the company's status. Unfortunately, phone and other records prove otherwise. Oops. Considering the fact that Frist is a public figure, that the money involved was a far larger amount than the one involved in the Martha Stewart case and the fact that the lie is so recent and fresh he cannot claim a faulty memory, it makes one wonder if this ""Good People"" will do ""Hard Time""."
1,I like toast,Wow. That sure is a purty house there on the cover. Must be some good people begetting there.
1,A SNOOZEFEST,"The Frist Family vanity publication is laughably stultifying and content-free. Once upon a time ""gimme cash, evade campaign reporting"" - type tomes were actually subatantive but ""Profiles in Courage"" this ain't. Come to think of it, ""It Takes a Village"" is freakin' Margaret Mead compared to this piece of yuck.At least Fritz explains why he killed the kittens he [...] acquired from animal shelters. [...]"

2,Buy Hawks instead,"Been a huge fan of power stop, but unfortunate they have moved their plants to china. Once notified by power stop that their brakes have gone over seas, i canceled my order with amazon, and bought USA made Hawk Pads.I will not put Chinese brake products on my Chevy. A cd player and speakers is one thing, but not brakes.. i want to stop when i have to."
4,A quality tribute to Che Guevara.,"Songs commemorating the 30-year anniversary of El Che's death. Most are very good. Songs by Carlos Puebla, Atahualpa Yupanqui, a speech by Che and songs by many other artists."
4,cd el Che vive,"An excellent tribute to Che Guevara. I particularly enjoyed being able to listen again to the original version of ""Hasta siempre, Commandante"" of which I had lost track since I was 18!"
1,Murderers shouldn't be idolized,"Che butchered thousands of innocent peasants in Cuba and South America simply because they would not join his cause. Why are you so ignorant? He may have started out with the intention to do good but like so many before and after him, he became worse than those he was fighting. Look up the story of William Morgan-- an American who fought with Che and Castro for democracy in Cuba. When Castro declared himself a Marxist, Morgan rebelled because that was not what he fought for. His execution was truly horrific! Pick up a book sometime and educate yourself!"
2,FLIMSY,THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY I SPENT OR THE S&H. I COULD HAVE GOTTEN SOMETHING JUST AS GOOD PROBABLY BETTER AT ANOTHER WELL KNOW DISCOUNT HOUSE. DEFINITELY NOT FOR A KID OR SOMEONE NEEDING A MORE DURABLE VERSION.
3,Like trying to fight the tide.,"This book has such a wonderful premise, the last of a dying race search for there home planet with the aid of an enemy who could not bear to commit genocide. Woo hoo... The wonderfully detailed charcters are still two dimensional after Cherryh spends chapters detailing every little nuance of there lives. The book gets bogged down in meaningless detail and turned out to be a very hard read."
5,Thirty years later,"When going to stage manage at Ford's Theatre, in 1979, I took with me a loaned collection of C. J. Cherryh. I had no idea of what to expect.Then I started the Faded Sun trilogy, but only had the first two volumes.When I had finished the second book I went right out to get the third! But it wasn't out, yet. This trilogy has remained through several sets of paperbacks in my collection. This specific book has gone down to a Battalion Commander at Fort Bragg. Here's looking at you, Tim!"
2,Long time in the desert!!,"This was the first C.J. Cherryh book that I bought and read. I really had to work at it and persevere to keep moving forward. The main characters seem to spend A LOT of time going across barren landscapes and talking without a while lot of action. This was an okay trilogy, but I personally think this could have been 1 book or 2, but really did not need to be 3."
3,Available as a Free PDF on the Web,"Look for a PDF on the web. It's free since it's a government publication. The third edition of this book was published in March, 2009."
3,I was in this movie,"I am interested in this movie because I was an extra in the film, they paid us a flat fee for the whole day, made the local extras eat after the dogs that stared in the film and made us stay all day. It kind of sucked all in all, but I still made it to the silver screen so that is why I am interested in the film, I made $50 for the whole day. The film was not an oscar contender."
3,I Loved The Movie!!,"In the Movie,Josh was in trouble and the movie was boring they went 5,000 miles and also Sam went the hosptial because he was bilnd in the movie! I'd loved the Movie!"
1,Horr-ee-bleh!,This is literally the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I watched it five years ago and I still can't get over the film's horridness. Don't ever see this movie! It deserves to be crushed!
5,Great Acoustic Blues,"This a great collection of acoustic blues standards, plus a great unplugged version of ""Wang Dang Doodle"". I had the good fortune of watching Terry Garland live, and his has a great intensity. One can almost picture Son House or Charley Patton driving along. He is also a very nice guy; I got to speak to him for a bit.If you really enjoy Delta blues, this is a great addition to your collection.The recording is very good, you can feel the snap of the strings and the foot stomps."
4,Plenty of Horns and a Great Big Sound!,"Dick's Hat Band is the brainchild of guitarist Ross Roberts and vocalist/harpist Mike Lawley. The band itself is based in Birmingham Alabama and this is their second release.While the liner notes are very sparse, it does list 62 people as being members of Dick's Hat Family Band, with at least 22 of those listed performing on this CD. Those individuals come in the way of a 7 piece horn section, a quartet of background vocalist and two separate rhythm sections that alternate throughout the CD.The band can loosely be categorized as a jump band in the same vien as the Roomful of Blues. Their sound however, mantains a distinct R&B; revue quality with wide ranging material from R&B; to Soulful ballads to swing to vintage slow blues. The group is very tight and the music produced is excellent. Highly recommended."
4,"""The Book of Blam"" describes Novi Sad of the 1940's.","In the past several weeks (April, 1999), Nato bombs dropped two of Novi Sad's bridges into the Danube River. This excellent novel, written by a man who experienced the human or inhuman tragedies of Novi Sad in the 1930's and 1940's helped me get a feeling for this city. The book appears to fill a gap in what can be found in ordinary U.S. public libraries."
3,"Functional but ""cheap""","Very functional and economical. Looks good from a distance, but finish is poor. Paper shades rip very easily. Pay more and get a better one."
5,A great primer for those going into Real Estate,I found this book as a valuable source for my Real Estate course I just completed. The books used in the course did not explain many terms where I could understand them. This book gave examples so I could related to the term. Very well written and a fantastic reference.
1,Not very helpfull.,"I was looking for help for taking a State test. Really, it is very general, and not helpful for my state (WI). The tips for taking the exam were very general, and basic. Example; get enough sleep, eat the right foods before the exam. It has some more specific information for California, but not for other states."
4,real estate for dummies,Comprehensive book for Real Estate helped for my exam in California .. would definitely keep it as a reference book for future reading.
3,"Good book, practice guides infinitely more useful","If you are just curious about RE, this is a great resource. If you are using it to study for a state exam, save your money. The book is very well done but far too much blathering on if you're just trying to pass an exam. As a resource, it's a good tool and you'll not be disappointed but you just may not find it that useful for your state exam after already taking your education requirements as it's just a regurgitation of that information."
2,Printed for 'dummies' and written by dummies,"I regret buying this book as it is not fairly described. This book is poorly organized, poorly presented with inadequately covered and explained state real estate course material. It is clearly not a professionally designed product. There are far superior books available for Course I and Course II. The entire concept of the publisher addressing a 'dummy' is disrespectful, hurtful and degrading to the reader."
3,Real Estate For Dummies,THis is the typical For Dummies book. There are many other books I would reference before this one. This book does not give enough incite into each section. I would use this as maybe a 2nd or 3rd back up book for preparing for the real estate exam.
5,real estate for Dummies book,This book was very helpful for preparing me for the state exam. It was very thorough and simple to understand. It delivered exactly what it said it would.
3,faux holder,I had expected much more in quality of material. The pockets were too small; slides back and forth on the hanger bar and zipper kept getting stuck!!
3,Sturdy but don't stop tarnish,"These are great for hanging in a closet or rolling up for travel, but don't count on them to help keep tarnish on your jewelry at bay. They are well made, however, and I am happy with them for the purposes I use them."
5,Awesome,"These are awesome - I love that you can zip up each compartment so nothing falls out. Easy to travel with, I sell jewelry threrfore I put all the pieces in 3 of these can fold them over and away I go!Also a great benefit is that the jewelry does not tarnish due to the type of fabric they have lined the jewelry case with."
4,Practical!,"Love this thing! I am finally organized, and can see everything I own. I took it with me on a trip, and it worked great. I only had one earring that got bent in it. I would only change one thing. The small pockets are all the same size and too small for several of my pieces. If I were to design it myself, I would increase the size of the neckless hanger to the whole width of the organizer, and I would provide two more sizes of pockets throughout. A great buy though!"
5,Fantastic!,"This is just what I needed! It is discreet, & keeps everything organized and easy to see!"
5,Way more organized now!,"If you have a slop of jewlery, this is the thing to get you organized. I love that it is double sided, you can put more in and see where everything is. It is also portable, and would fit in a suitcase nice. I would never need that much stuff for the type of trips I go on, but it's nice to know you have that option. Hangs nicely in the closet and takes up minimal space. LOVE IT!"
1,Not if you love Gilbert & Sullivan,"While the production quality is excellent, this is not a good choice for those who truly love Gilbert and Sullivan as they wrote it. The Aussies changed the lyrics in several songs, probably in a misguided attempt to modernize it. A failed gesture that proves great works cannot be improved upon. If you enjoy seeing a classic taken down to the level of the gutter, then this is for you. If you love the original lyrics then this will surely disappoint you. Sorry I wasted the money on it and will never again buy Australian."
1,Abysmal sound quality,"Can't say much about the other aspects of the disc or performance, as I couldn't get past the first couple of songs. Sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom."
1,Too hard for kids to use!,"I bought this book for my 7 year old. The one I own is not user friendly. I wanted to purchase a different version hoping it would have an easy way to insert the coins so my son could 'do it by himself'. It is so hard for him to do, that he has to pound them in with his fist. It's very irritating & exactly the opposite of what I was seeking."
2,Good Quality EXCEPT WRONG PAGE,"As I see from other comments on this product, I agree that it has very nice hard-bound finish. HOWEVER, I received a bound with a screw-up of pages; mine has one missing sheet (Sheet #2) and a duplicate of another (Sheet #3). I saw people's comments of similar products having this type of problem but I realized it could be true for this one, too."
5,Great album,I ordered one for my husbands collection and he liked it so much that he had me order another and they both turned out to be exactly what he was looking for.
2,Statehood Quarter Album,"The individual pages came loose from the binding after very little handling on our part. I tried, with moderate success, to glue them back on, but you can see the glue and it is unknown if it will hold a week, a month or a year.I chose not to try and send it back, because returning items typically involves too much hassle.We are currently in need of 2 Presidential Gold Dollar books, but we may need to find a different vendor to achieve a more solid product."
2,Space,for only one mint mark. What were they thinking? Not badly made but thoughtlessly. Forget coin collectingafter this mess.
5,For the Grandchildren,"I have been saving Statehood Quarters for some time. I have three grandchildren and wanted them to each receive a collection of Statehood Quarters minted in Denver and Philly. I had to buy two books for each grandchild and it worked out great. The books are very sturdy and easy to use. There were a few holes that were a ""little"" tight but not bad. I like that you get to see the front and back of the quarters. I gave them to the grandchild this Christmas and they really enjoy them. However, we're still looking for a few missing quarters. I know I can go online and find them but it's more fun to look."
3,quarter book,"Unfortunately, the book does not have the pages for the territories and landmarks for which quarters were made. Otherwise, it id a good quality item."
2,Statehood Quarter Album,"If the selection had shown size, I would not have purchased it. It is tiny with many pages. I have 3 other state quarter books which are large, with a map of the U.S. The quarters are placed on the appropriate state. Much superior to this produce."
5,Nice Display,"This is a very nice way to display your State Quarters. There is only room for one of each quarter so you will not be able to do multiple mints in the same book. For single mint only. Also this book is missing the page for D.C. and the territories, which is easily purchasable separately."
5,best quarter collection folder,This booklet exceeded our expectations. It is far superior to the simple cardboard books. The quarters fit well without having to force them and the plastic covers keep them in place. Best coin collecting booklet we have.
4,Just what I needed,My boyfriend bought this for me as a gift. I had been collecting the new style quarters but it was impossible to stay organized and keep track of which ones I had and did not have. I only wanted to save one of each design.This was perfect for me to organize my quarters and then spend the rest.
3,Pleased,"Good product but I wish I could have viewed the inside, it didn't have the dates under each quarter insert, and it was a little more difficult to insert. However, it's a place to put the quarters and keeps them in order. I appreciated the fast delivery!"
4,very good,"rivets holding inserts in cover needs enhancements so that they do not come out leaving the books unusable. rivets need large flanges on the inside,"
4,Ancient Promises,"Ancient Promises by Jaishree Misra is her biographical novel. The way the author has weaved her story in her debut novel is commendable. The story flows effortlessly and there are no sudden stops or sudden beginnings.This novel is about Janu - the central character of the novel. Janu, a Malyali girl born and brought up in Delhi, is married off to a businessman of one of the influential families of Kerala. Her trials & tribulations, her fight for her rights, and her standing up for herself & her daughter - is nicely presented.Is Janu able to stand up for her and her daughter's rights at the end? Read on to find out!It's recommended."
4,Review of Ancient Promises,"Jaishree Misra's debut novel is compellingly readable and extremely authentic (I should know--I attended the school she describes, and I am from Kerala myself), her characters sympathetic and well-drawn--highly recommend this book to one and all, but especially to readers familiar with or interested in India."
5,Fun for kids who love cars,"My son first started playing with this toy when he was 18 months. He still plays with it today, at 3-1/2 -- sometimes even out of the tub. He loves cars, so he's naturally biased towards enjoying this simple, but fun toy."
2,Fun for a while,"My 14 month old got this toy for Christmas last year. She had lots of fun with it, as did my then 4 year old. The shower head was hard for the little one to squeeze, but that wasn't the big problem. Despite our efforts to squeeze out all the water at the end of bath time, after a few months the inside of the shower head had so much mildew that we had to cut it off of the toy. We thought they could still play with the track part, but without the shower my girls soon got bored with it and it has not been played with in months."
3,Cute toy but won't squirt water now,"We bought this toy in hopes that it would keep my very active little one seated in the tub. He loves cars so I figured it would be great. He gets very frustrated becuase the cars can't go all the way around the track. There are places on the side where the car is supposed to go through things that are supposed to spin. My son gets frustrated because he can't get them through. Also, the thing that sprays water on the cars broke. It won't squirt water anymore. I agree with the other poster though, it was really hard to squirt."
2,Not toddler friendly,I bought this bath toy for my 2 year old. It's not very user-friendly - the cars can barely squeeze between the car wash and roller functions. It took a lot of effort on my part and my son couldn't do it himself. The sprayer was cute although my son couldn't really do that himself either because you have to have patience for the sprayer to fill with water after you squeeze it to spray the water. I wouldn't recommend it for young toddlers.
3,Good but with problems,"My son loves cars so this was a fun toy. However, despite emptying the water out of the ""carwash"" after every bath, it still developed mold/mildew inside. we cleaned it once but it soon came back."
2,Cute but not very functional,The car wash is very cute to look at BUT it is very difficult to play with. The cars don't roll down the ramp and are even difficult to push through. The cars also don't fit under the orange water hose. the picture displays a car under that can actually be washed but really not going to happen. If I could do it again I wouldn't buy.
2,Not that Great,"Another toy that's just taking up space. I have been looking for the prefect bath toy for a while and still haven't found it! :( My kids are 2 1/2 and 1 so maybe they are just too young, but I wish I could go back in time because I would not have ordered this. I wasted money again!"
2,OK BATH TOY,"This seems to be a little high priced for a bath toy, that is not all that much fun. My son loves cars so I thought he would love this. The only thing he likes about it is the cars. The shower part is hard for him to use and the parts that the car drives through (the spounges and scrubers) are almost to small it is hard for my little one to push the cars through it."
1,"Dude, it doesn't fit!","In the picture, do you see where the purple car is in front of the orange sponge? Any normal person would assume the car ""drives through"" that spot to get scrubbed, like a real car wash. But apparently the engineers who designed this toy has never been through a car wash. The sponges are too close together so the car won't fit through. Same issue with the purple spinning things on the other side. The orange thing with white polka dots is a squirter that is so stiff, even the adults have trouble with it.Although I like the fact that the cars flip upside-down to become cups, I'm sorry to say the Sassy company screwed up and missed the basic concept of a car wash."
3,Sassy Car Wash Bath Toy Review,Very cute toy. My daughter was more interested in the cars than the actual car wash but it may be something she'll grow into.
4,Sudsy good time,My daughter loves her car wash. The only problem is the sprayer is hard to get squish the water out for a child.
3,Good Fun,"This toy was loads of fun to play with with my daughter. She loves cars, and is facinated by the shower. She has it in her bath everytime. It floats and adds lots of learning time to bath time. She loves to play with the dump truck, and the squirting car is one of the best squirting toys we have for the bathtub."
3,only OK,"This toy was not as big of a hit as I thought it would be. It takes up too much room in the bath and my son didn't really get into it. He did like the cars though, and he plays with those separate. I think there are much better bath toys out there to be had. It pains me to write a mediocre review as Sassy is usually my toy brand of choice."
4,Great purchse,My nephew (and my daughter!) loved this toy. It actually had cool action. I'd definitely recommend it.
4,Distinct viewpoint,"For decades after her death in 1895, Maria Amparo was virtually forgotten in the United States. Montes and Goldman have unearthed and reanalysed her writings, showing her as an astute commentator on the expansion (conquest) of the US into its south west. When Amparo was writing, the Mexican-American War was recent vintage, and the annexation of California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona was still an open wound to those Mexicans who were forcibly turned into Americans.The authors also show how Amparo critiqued the post Civil War US society and its Gilded Age, from the distinct vantage of a Mexican American. It should be of interest to those of you who have studied that time, perhaps via more ""conventional"" mainstream American historians. Some of her novels criticise Anglo racism, but instead replace them with a Spanish racism that allows mixing, but retains ""whiteness as the highest identity marker""."
3,Nice lather ... Furniture Polish scent,"I want to love this soap, and will try other varieties, but this one just smells too much like Pledge. Not necessarily a bad thing for ME, since my honey is a clean-a-holic, but not the scent I want to be enveloped in, either! The good news is it's a nice big bar, smooth to the touch, and the lather is rich (though not quite as moisturizing as I expected) ... and fortunately, the scent doesn't linger. But in the shower, I don't want to feel like I'm washing with cleaning solution, so we'll pass on the Verbena scent next time."
2,A Bit of a Let Down,"I was very excited about 'Victim in Victoria Station' and could not wait to get started. However, I was soon disappointed. The reason for Alan not being there was very contrived and I cannot imagine anyone rushing off to keep an appointment after her experience on the train. There were too many characters in the office to keep track of, especially since they were not very relevant to the story. The murders and motives are never explained, yet we are taken ad nauseam through endless (fruitless?) late night searches. Not one of the best in the series. Missed the hats as well, although I did enjoy the red one near the beginning."
2,Disappointed,"I could hardly wait to read this latest Dorthey Martin book. So I bought the hard cover. It is so bad I almost did't finish it. The murders are never explained. The characters are all gray and you need a guide to tell them apart. In the end you think to yourself,""That is it?"" Mrs. Martin, not your best effort."
4,Great Dorothy Caper,"Dorothy Martin continues her amateur sleuth career in London this time. Dams has a wonderful knack for characters and setting that brings you full tilt into the wacky life of her heroine. The wig and rhinestone glasses disguise she dons along with her gimpy leg made me laugh out loud. Dams' books are addictive escapism, and this is no exception. Dorothy hauls her friends into helping her solve the case and even when her instincts are muddled, she stays on track, issuing orders and plotting the demise of the wretched murderer.I have to say, as one who has enjoyed all of this series, I wish the author would go into a few more details about the solving of the mystery from Dorothy's point of view. But all in all, Dorothy Martin has become an old friend that I look forward to spending time with again soon."
3,3 CD's with pleasant music - not a bad buy!,"Instrumental, 3 CD's, the first with Sax, 2nd with Piano and 3rd with Trumpet. All three are easy listening, modern songs, accompanied by orchestra, with a nice beat. Shopping centre music. If you like the genre, you will appreciate it."
3,Fun,I liked this book but not as well as Hot Shot by the same author. It was still a good read though.
1,So bad!,"I am a big fan of ""chick lit"" but this book was awful! I think my biggest complaint is that it was just so obvious. Instead of letting us discover the characters quirks on our own, Hughes gives away the whole character upon first introduction. It was beyond predictable, and every character acted exactly as their stereotype dictated. I read the whole book thinking it had to get better, or offer some twist, but no - predictable to the very last page."
5,New Attitude,This was one of the funniest books I've ever read.This woman gets in so many messes she should have just stayed home.I hope that Charlotte Hughes writes more books with this much humor.
1,Product leaked - would not seal. Seller adjusted sales to my satisfaction.,Product leaked badly when installed. I called the seller for adjustment & the problem was resolved to my satisfaction.
4,Playn on Mystikal,The Mystikal Danger single is a power packed song. I am starting a DJ business and my clients love it. Its a great song no doubt and I play it every party!
4,Very Nice,"Of all the books in the Ultimate series, this is probably the one I liked least. It touches on all the topics covered in the other books but in less detail. If you are going to buy only one book in the series then this is probably the best one to buy. Otherwise, you may as well buy the others as the material is covered in all his other books in a more detailed and focused manner. I started by buying this book and only much later did I buy the others. Good buy and good value and even more so if you don't need the details and are just looking for the high level overview."
2,"Million Dollar Consulting, Part II","After having spent almost twice the money for this book than Alan's ""Million Dollar Consulting"", I found little to no new information. Take my advice: buy a copy of Alan's wonderful ""Million Dollar Consulting"" and spend the savings elsewhere in your practice. Good luck."
1,Get the other book and save money,"The book is OK, but repeats his previous efforts. Go buy his previous book (already in paperback)and save $$."
1,Terrible and no words,"ok I never heard this record and I'm glad. I did I don't want to make you feel bad. but, when I heard it on the sample it didn't have any words just horns. I don't recommend you get this I recommend you get South Pacific with words."
2,Gold Charm,"The charm was very pretty, however in the description there was nothing to indicate the size of the charm and I did not realize that it would be too small for my daughter."
4,good price,The tank came in great shape and has worked great for me. I also shopped around before buying it online and I could not find it cheaper in the stores or online.
4,Very Impressive First Book,"When I bought this book, I expected that it would be a formulaic book of short stories, most of which were written for writing classes or workshops. I was pleasantly surprised to find a book full of beautiful language, original stories, and a unique voice. John McManus experiments with language in a way that only a person who truly understands it could; he is not a novice. Some of the stories were so good, they could easily translate into novels. I can't wait until John McManus publishes a novel."
1,Product not working,"When i got this item it was DOA and i have to ship it back, i know it am going to have trouble too since i live in barbados. Its a great card but it just didnt work out for me."
4,Thermostat cover,Nothing special. It does what it is supposed to do. Not really a secure device. Just keeps out honest people.
1,Does not fit all Honeywell Thermostats as advertised,"I have a Honeywell RTH8580WF thermostat and this case is too small. It says right on the packaging that it fits ""All"" Honeywell thermostats and most others.I'm sure if it fits your thermostat, it's probably a fine product. Remember to measure and the inside dimensions (the mounting bracket) reduces the overall size about an inch, top and bottom.Returning mine."
2,Separated key luck from cover,"Due to a week clip, which holding the key lock to the door, itemis deemed usless unless clip is replaced by another one identecal. it must be a better way to hold that key lock to the door of the cover"
3,Weak point in product,"Item is as described and produces end results. Weak point is clip that secures the lock, broken on arrival on 5 out of 21 purchased. The remainder appears will break shortly, negating the purpose for cover as the lock will fall out. Currently seeking a remedy to this weak point for an otherwise good product."
2,Thermostat Guard,"It really didn't fit as is, but I cut some ears off of it and it now fits. It can be accessed easy with little effort because of the design."
2,Wrong dimentions,The dimentions given under the product description are the dimentions of the package. the product itself is a few inches smaller. I had to return it. Otherwise the product itself is of high quality and would have been given 5 stars.
5,Thank God (and Honeywell) for these!,"Finally decided to install one of these after years of exasperation as a reluctant (read: dragged kicking and screaming) participant in my own household WHODUNIT saga. You know the drill -- one moment the kids' wing is freezing cold, then hellishly hot the next, fans turned to ""on"" instead of auto, etc., and so the cycle goes on and on. In come I, very annoyed, asking my (young adult) kids who has been tinkering with the thermostat AGAIN! Tired of the usual ""I don't know"", ""not me,"" ""ask her/him/ them, ""you'd be surprised"", ""must have switched itself on/off, up/down"", ""maybe the housekeeper did it"", and my favorite yet, ""you sure the house isn't haunted?"" replies, I decided to get this puppy and lo and behold, no more thermostatic fluctuations =)). Now I am happy and they know exactly whodunit!"
3,Candy EO 825,this is good to keep the heat setting . but its huge i have a small circle thermostat so the case swallows it
3,Good tea; producer has major attitude tho!,"Had some white pear tea in gift box I rec'd at XMAS and searched for more...found the Revolution White Pear tea on Amazon and order a case. It isn't the same item as was in gift basket but I opened up a box and in the tea infuser bags you see the tea and whispy yellow material that I had not encounteredin a tea before. I contacted Revolution tea via their website and was informed in NO UNCERTAIN MANNER that this was a sign of the highest quality of tea and gosh darn, I'm not sure how I lived so long to not know that before! But now I do. Enjoy this light flavored tea but don't be surprised by the yellow wispies you'll find in it; and certainly, don't ask the vendor about them unless you are ready for their attitude that goes along with them educating you about what a proper tea should look like...!"
1,The Garden is Bare,"If you like Nesmith's music - whether it's from his days as a Monkee, his first 6 post-Monkees LP's with their distinct country-flavour or his later LPs (The Prison, From A Radio Engine To The Photon Wing, Live At The Palais or Infinite Rider On The Big Dogma) - this will disappoint... it's nothing like any of those.Ok, so it's pleasant enough, but apart from about 10 seconds of half-hearted singing, this is an instrumental CD.You know it's a Nesmith CD - the label tells you so, but it could be anyone's.By all means, buy it if you like instrumental music, but if you are a Nesmith fan, be warned... and I speak as a long-time admirer of his music.His latest offering comes out in April (Rays) - let's hope it's an improvement on this."
4,Twilight Zone,"Gotfried Wagner gives us the inside story on the Wagner dynasty. He is certainly an nonconformist Wagner: a supporter of social - democracy and a promoter of German - Jewish understanding who wrote his doctorate on the Jewish composer Kurt Weil. Dr. Wagner tells us what it was like growing up in the strange world of Bayreuth and about the infighting between the heirs to the dynasty.He leaves no doubts as to the historical anti-semitism of the Wagner legacy as well as the war time collabaration with the Nazis (Hitler was endearingly called ""Uncle Wolf""). That anti - semitism lives on today. He considers Daniel Birenboim as somewhat of a careerist and a dupe who purposely chooses to ignore the anti - semitism of Bayreuth. Dr. Wagner completely broke with the Wagner heritage and for this he has my admiration. An interesting story but the book cold have been better edited and reduced by say, fifty pages."
5,Awesome!,"This was actually a decent film, BUT the price was definitely steep when I bought it.Fast delivery!"
3,Great Concept/Poor Labeling,"I will first say that I like the Vinyl Disc CD-Rs, and will continue to use them. HOWEVER, if you are purchasing the printable CD-R's be sure that you are only going to print Text on them. Verbatim gives you no space to put a real design (artwork) on it because the core of the CD is not printable and has their Name on it.If you are trying to include a design, as in a picture of some sort, I would suggest that you purchase the color CD-Rs (which are a few bucks cheaper) and then purchase their labels. I must also say the Verbatim labeling system is cumbersome and not very efficient, especially and specifically compared to the NEATO labeling system, but unfortunately NEATO does not make Vinyl CD-R labels any more, which is truly a shame because their labeling system is far superior to Verbatim's."
2,Not as advertised,"Face it, this product is all about the cool look. That's why I bought two 50-packs at a price that's considerably higher than I typically pay for CD-Rs.The shipment arrived today, and while the discs have the faux vinyl groove look, all 100 CDs have very plain white labels -- not the ""color coded"" labels that the product description suggests. This might be why all the other digital vinyl products have color photos of the product and this one does not.I'm sure they'll work fine (thus the two stars), but without the ""cool"" factor they're not worth the extra money."
1,"Wong Picture, be careful!",Be careful when buying these discs based on the picture. They don't have the label as shown. They are blank white in the middle and are made for ink jet printing. Check the manufacturer's web site for pictures.
4,digital vinyl 50 pack CDR,"They are high-quality and worth the money if you want a visually pleasing CD that resembles an old vinyl 45rpm record.HERE'S THE PROBLEM:Nobody seems to be able to tell me which printers will print these CD's!!!VERBATIM (the manufacturer) was useless.I got some woman on the phone who acted annoyed with me, and said ""they will work with any printer that prints CDs"" WELL THEY DON'T!!!!So now I have 50 cd's that I cannot label...I can't seem to find a printer that says specifically that it will print these (and printers are about $100so there is NO WAY I can do trial and error to find the right one!!!PLEASE.....if anyone KNOWS FOR SURE which printer(s) I can use to label these , please let me know!And in the meantime, VERBATIM should do their research and provide shoppers with a list of printers that will print their cd's, or they are selling a USELESS product"
3,Subliminal CD,I don't know how to review a subliminal message since I don't know what the message was. I received the cd in good condition and in a reasonable amount of time.
1,DISAPPOINTING,"THIS BOOK IS FILLED WITH SINGLE PAGE ACCOUNTS OF RANGER, AIRBORNE AND SPECIAL FORCE FIGHTING IN WORLD WAR II. THEY FALL WAY SHORT OF WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN. A B40 ROCKET FRAGMENT SAW TO IT THAT I SPEND THE REST OF MY DAYS IN A WHEELCHAIR AND BECAUSE OF IT I HAVE READ MY SHARE OF WORLD WAR II BOOKS AND BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY BEYOND VALOR IS AN OPEN HOLE. I SUGGEST THOSE THAT BELIEVE BEYOND VALOR A COMPELLING READ SPEND A DAY OR TWO IN A DAV, VFW OR A VETERANS HOSPITAL.THOSE INTERESTED IN WWII RANGERS I SUGGEST *RANGERS IN WWII* BY ROBERT BLACK. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ORAL HISTORIES I SUGGEST *DEATH MARCH* (BATAAN DEATH MARCH IN WWII) BY DONALD KNOX OR *THE KOREAN WAR* ALSO BY DONALD KNOX. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN NAM I SUGGEST THE COMPELLING STORY OF THE 26TH MARINES SEP 67 MAULING IN *AMBUSH VALLEY* BY ERIC HAMMEL."
2,Where's the Beef?,"The folks who gave this book 5 stars must be friends of the publisher of author. The author provides the historical background for each operation (for example TORCH in North Africa or The Battle of the Bulge). Then each soldier's individual experience are detailed. But something is lost in the translation. The individual experiences must have been very exciting, harrowing events, but they sure don't come across that way. I recommend ""Seven Roads to Hell"" for exciting, engaging reading."
4,"Pleasureable, not one of the best.","The accounts written in Beyond Valor are stunning at times and mediocre at others. It does not appear Mr. O'Donnell was able to garnish the actions, words and behaviors he was after, yet left the stories in regardless. I finised the book in short time, but felt most of the subjects were only interviewed on the surface. I anticiapted detail and depth that was not present in this book. It is interesting reading but requires other rescources to fill in the blanks."
2,"Okay reading but with ""shallow"" accounts","Patrick O'Donnell's Beyond Valor is WWII oral histories of ranger, special forces and airborne vets. This book is an okay read, but there is something missing, and I may not even be able to put my finger on it. This book is surprisingly dull reading considering the subject matter and the possibilities. I found myself ""struggling"" though it. Much of the narrative reads like written emails and letters usually read: (respectfully) unemotional, shallow, short to be sure, and, because of it the material is very disconnected when connected with other narratives.For the historians who are really serious about airborne, commando, or Special Forces I am COMPELLED to mention the new book ""The Black Devil Brigade"". I picked mine up from the military book club and i think it is the new standard in WWII oral history. It will make you laugh and cry, something that Beyond Valor failed to do."
2,"WHERE""S THE BEEF? II","I BOUGHT THIS BOOK THROUGH THE MILITARY BOOK CLUB BECAUSE OF ALL THE POSITIVE AMAZON REVIEWS. BOY WAS I IN FOR A SURPRISE. THIS BOOK CONSIST OF LITTLE STORIES WRITTEN OR NARRATED BY AIRBORNE, RANGER AND SPECIAL FORCE PERSONNEL. IT'S JUST THAT, LITTLE STORIES BUT WITH NO DEPTH. I AGREE WITH OTHER REVIEWS THAT ASK, ""WHERE IS THE BEEF?"" THE STORIES MAY HAVE BEEN INTENSE AT THE TIME BUT THEY DO NOT COME ACROSS LIKE THAT. THE MATERIAL READS LIKE A LONG, AND VERY BORING LETTER. NO BACK GROUND (NONE!) IS GIVEN TO EACH BATTLE AND THE READER IS LOST UNLESS HE/SHE ALREADY IS AWARE OF THE BATTLE WHICH IS EXPLAINED. THESE STORIES ARE NOT FILLED WITH HORROR OR TRAGIDY LIKE JOSEPH SPRINGER'S ORAL HISTORY THE BLACK DEVIL BRIGADE... I HAVE LEARNED O'DONNEL IS DOING ANOTHER BOOK LIKE THIS ABOUT THE PACIFIC WAR. I HOPE HE ASK HARDER QUESTIONS. MAYBE TH MARINES WILL TELL IT LIKE IT IS."
2,"Good Material, Poor Presentation","The stories were great, but the author did'nt provide enough background information to keep the reader abreast of the event. For example, no reason was given for a particular raid that wasted the lives of several men. What was the objective? Why the raid? This situation ocurred several times in the book. A bit dull."
2,boring and hollow,"i was very disappointed with beyond valor. it is made up of stories from many of the finest trained combat soldiers the americans has ever fielded in modern warfare. but after i read this book i thought it was boring. what a disappointment. i recommend the simmering and newly released black devil brigade for engrossing reading. you will not be bored, that is for sure."
5,A Band of Brothers,"Beyond Valor is by far the best oral history of WWII, and I've read all of them. The author does a masterful job of weaving their stories together with his own narrative. As someone who occupation revolves around oral history, I was most impressed by the way he provided minimal editing to their voices which are candid and give the reader a sense that your in the foxhole with these men. Smell, taste, and feelings toward their war that many of these men have buried for nearly sixty years come alive in this amazing book. I highly recommend it!"
5,Beyond Valor,Beyond Valor is a book that gives you a look at war through the eye of not one man but gives you a look at war through the eyes of 50 men. World War 2 vets reveal the heart of combat from the landing on Italy to the sweet boat ride home. I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to read a book that will have you thinking what it was like to be fighting in a war. And shows you a real look at war and not that Hollywood bull look that movies give you. So if you what a book that is suspenseful and interesting look at war. Buy Beyond Valor by Patrick K. O'Donnell and see the realty of war. If you like this book check out Into The Rising Sun.
4,Interesting twist on mob movies,"Being a fan of mob-type movies I found the plot of Beyond Recognition intriguing. A world reknowned plastic surgeon is called upon to make a ""client"" unrecognizable. It is when he refuses the real fun begins. Explosive and, sometimes, terrifying suspense thriller. Very entertaining."
5,Bird Behavior and Biology...Great Stuff!!,"Though a few years old, this book is a wonderful explanation of everything avian. A mixture of behavior, ecology and physiology, The Lives of Birds integrates these diciplines seamlessly and in an enjoyable way. In his explanations of how various birds are adapted to their environment Short is careful to avoid the tiresome and dopey teleology that passes for wisdom from many nature journalists (for a quick example, see PBS's ""Nature"").If only my college texts were written so lucidly!"
1,Phew!!!!!!,"I have taken Ginkgo Biloba with Vinpocetine 60 mg softgels for years with no problem. But the company must have changed their formula. Now the minute you open the bottle, you are assaulted by an obnoxious smell, so bad that one of my family members gagged. In about 60 seconds the odor from the open bottle completely filled the room and we had to leave. The odor smells like dirty toilet. Bought another bottle with a different expiration date and lot number. Same result. I will never buy this product again."
1,NOT a Standardized Extract,"TruNature Ginkgo Biloba does NOT contain the standardized ginkgo extract, as it lacks 6% Terpene Lactones (at least the bottle purchased through Amazon did not list it, but only listed the 24% Ginkgo Flavonglycosides; both together are the standard). And this product contains a relatively higher amount of Vinpocetine than other brands, which is a periwinkle extract that might induce side effects such as reduced immune function and depleted catecholamine levels leading to depression (see wikipedia's Vinpocetine article). TruNature is a Costco product."
5,Good Short-Haired Cat Brush,"I have owned one of these brushes for 5 years, and it is still soft and in new condition. My cat Anya, a Russian Blue, likes it, and it definitely helps get the loose hairs before they find my clothes and bed. I bought it for our lab/collie mix but it didn't seem to do as good a job on her. We now have a Silky Terrier, and he likes it, but since he doesn't shed, it's not as effective on him. I have also tried it on our chinchilla, and it does not work well on her. But, for short-haired cats, it's great!"
5,Great product for Siamese,This product works very well for my applehead Siamese. It leaves her coat very shiny while only removing the loose hairs.
2,Kitty Curry Brush,"I purchased this brush based on the reviews. Unfortunately, I did not find that it did a good job of removing hair even if I brushed against the hair growth first, then with the hair growth. My kitten is a short haired tabby, but it does very little in gathering hair. I found the fine wire brush did a better job, though I will say she enjoys this brush better--sort of like a massage."
5,One of the greatest live albums??,"Having just listened to this CD for the first time, I am impressed to the point of considering it as one of the great live albums, right up there with Live on Two Legs (Pearl Jam), and Live at Leeds (The Who). AIC just have a certain energy, a certain stigma live that puts them head and shoulders above most of the barely-average bands permeating the scene today. That power is more than evident on 'Them Bones', 'Love Hate Love', 'Again', and a monstrous juggernaut of a rendition of 'Junkhead'. There's a genuine feeling there, a power that most bands today just don't have.A double CD might have been nice (Down in a Hole, Heaven Beside You, and What the Hell Have I are strangely absent, along with a few others)... but all in all this stands as a top notch live encapsulation of the one of the great bands of the nineties."
3,I was hurt by this one,"The tracks in Live were culled from several concerts in the early 1990s. The track selection is strong, but the performances for the most part are lacking. The instrumentation is lost in the distortion, and Staley's voice isn't very strong on most of the tracks. If you must own a live Alice in Chains album, opt for the much sweeter Unplugged. Otherwise, stick with the studio stuff."
3,Fans Thrown a Bone,"It's too bad Alice In Chains couldn't have released a live CD that was reasonable in quality and content. One thought crossed my mind as I listened and tried to develop an acquired taste for the latest release: there's no way this could be the same band!!!! Obviously, the worst was listening to ""Them Bones"" --a thirteen year old boy could carry a better tune. The second worst element was listening to the vocals--lead singer L.S. sounded like his teeth were about to fall out. But hey, I guess releasing ""Live"" was better than nothing."
4,Memories Of An Awesome Band,"Sometimes forgotten by the rock mainstream, Alice In Chains is Seattle's red-headed stepchild. With so much of the focus on Nirvana and Pearl Jam, AIC quietly recorded some of the best music of the ninety's. Layne Staley's awesome voice, along with Jerry Cantrell's great guitar and backing vocals led the way. This CD is a pretty good example of how they were not only a great studio band, but an awesome live act. It is a good blend of the more well known AIC songs mixed with classics known more to hardcore AIC fans. My only complaint is the ommission of two of my personal favorites, ""It Aint Like That"", and ""Heaven Beside You"" Of course this is only my opinion, and you probably don't give a damn, but I would've liked them included. That's not a reason to pass this one up though. Not perfect, but close enough for hungry Alice In Chains fans. Peace"
5,Finally-Alice Live...Worth the wait,"How could this incredible live band not release a live album for 10 years.Well it is worth the wait. These 14 songs show all the power of one of the greatest and most missed band's of the '90sIncredible versions of Rooster, Love Hate Love and Bleed The Freak.When you hear Man In The Box, you are amazed at the power of Layne Staley's voice.A great albumA must for all the fansSee where most of of the new crop of bands got their song ideas... (Godsmack, etc)Long Live AliceThe real thing"
4,AIC plugged.,"Pretty much a companion piece to the unplugged album, much like Nirvana's live ""Muddy Banks"" disc was to their ""Unplugged in NY"". I guess. This is a solid release for any level of fan. Maybe not essential, but a must for fanatics. Like most live albums it's cool to hear the band interact with the crowd a bit, get loose and not shoot for perfection. The songs choices are decent enough, part hits, part obscure cuts. ""Queen Of The Rodeo"" is a unique AIC track they whipped-out for a Dallas crowd. Nice to see ""Junkhead"" included. Hearing Layne brings mixed emotions, but the songs rock, and it's the only live Alice In Chains we'll ever hear again with him. RIP Layne and Mike."
4,Long live ALICE IN CHAINS,The power of the vocals live cannot be denied. Track selection is very good and so is the editing.
2,Kind of a let down,"Alice in Chains soun nothing like they do on there albums. They just don't work live...There take on ""Man in The Box"" is lacking power and feeling like the album track did. Rooster is sounds to noodleing to be great. There songs work better with acoustics when live."
4,Awsome,This cd is awsome. The best track on here is Love Hate Love. I would just like to express the fealings of every AIC fan and say that this is a long waited and well deserved album and all I have to say is Alice come back we all need you.
5,A fantastic album from a great band,"AIC live is a terrific album from AIC.This album features some super live renditions of classic songs like Dirt,Man in the box and Rooster.This album is great and is highly recommended."
5,Awesome Live Performance of an Awesome band,"This CD is a ""must have"" for the true fan of the band. Here is (one of the few) chances to have a shot at experiencing an Alice in Chains concert for those who were never fortunate enough to be there when it happened and for those who were and would like to relive the moment. This is a true time capsule as unfortunately Layne Staley is now gone and recordings such as this allow him to live on with a great mix of their songs and is also the only cd to have ""Queen of the Rodeo"" on it, which was a ""concert only"" song, never being intended for a studio track as Layne did not like the song amd it started out as a joke mocking country music and later became a fan favorite at the shows"
5,Sad testament to the power that ws ALICE IN CHAINS,"As a huge fan, it's sad to see what the promise of this great band turned into at the end. This cd is divided into 1/3's. The first is taken from the LIVE FACELIFT video and shows a hungry AIC kicking major butt. Then the 2nd 1/3 shows the band at the top of the game and just stunningly brilliant around the time DIRT came out. And then the sad part where the final show is captured on here and the sound of Layne's straining voice seals the tomb on this influential band. Hopefully one day AIC will return in better health and spirits and reclaim the title KINGS OF GRUNGE. A band that is sorely missed and showes what the devil of addiction can do to the human spirit."
2,Disappointed,I understand that this bath salt used to be natural. (i cannot be sure) This product smells nice and contains synthetic coloring which I do not need or want.
4,Is there a newer edition?,I thought it's a very decent piece of work. However it needs update particularly the technology part.
5,Fabulous and entertaining reference material,This fabulous book serves as an instant vocabulary enhancer and is packed with finely illustrated pictures that not only widen one's knowledge but also make for hours of wholesome entertainment.
3,Doesn't Really Help for Non-Inflammatory Acne,"I have non-inflammatory acne. ALl of my acne is underneath the skin. I'm sure this would work great for acne that was on the surface, but it's not for me."
2,Not for emergent readers!,"Simply put, the cluttered illustrations make it nearly impossible for a beginning reader to be supported by this book. It is, in my opinion, not particularly interesting, as it is primarily a list of objects with short vowel sounds. (There are a few long vowel sounds thrown in.) All in all, there are many more supportive, interesting books for young readers to begin their reading lives with."
1,A Millennium CD ?????,"This CD was boring and tedious to get through. The entire cd is only a mediocre effort at best! Freestyle doesn't need any more efforts like this one as there is already too many compilations out there with the exactly the same formula. As a long-term freestyle producer and artist, Marano(Collage)should not have settled and sold out. Why would anyone want to add the same old to their cd collections. Fans deserve better. Hold out for a better more worthy collection!"
2,A decent compilation,"Track 11, by Milan Bass, is pretty good.. it has a unique sound to it. I also liked Track 14, which is all in spanish.The rockell remake of Dreamboy/Dreamgirl is alright but no where as good as the original.. likewise, Can't We Try is a good song but I got tired of it about the fifth time I heard it.I like a lot of Elissas other songs but not ""Mamboleo"" which is on this CD. The last track on the CD is kinda wack just listen to it.The duet ""Boyfriend/Girlfriend"" has a nice beat but the lyrics are funny ""She's my best friend's girlfriend, Even though I know it's wrong / I want her so badly, I had to write this song"".The worst song on this CD is Shayme's - My love is loco. He keeps singing about getting inside of you... gross song.Overall this CD is about 2 stars out of 5. It has some good songs on it. Overall, the beats are great but some of the vocals could use a lot of work."
1,Wrong,"""This DVD includes highlights of the 2005 Fighting Illini's run to the National Championship""Ummmmmm............UNC won the title......idiots"
1,Useless junk,"If I could give this zero stars, I would. There is no plastic sleeves over the hooks to protect the plat from damage. But, even worse, once you put the the hanger on the plate, there is NO WAY TO HANG THE PLATE!!!!!!!!!!! It's a ""hanger,"" so it's supposed to ""hang"" the plate, right. But, no. The whole of the hanger is flush against the plate leave no place to catch onto a hanger set into your wall. The picture looks like there is a small protuberance in the pieces that hold the two springs apart that sticks out from the back in order to hang the plate. But, that protuberance does NOT stick out. It is flush against the plate. I know this is an inexpensive piece, but I should at least be able to use it. Truly a waste of my time and money. I'm not going to waste more time going to the post office to return it. Not a happy customer tonight."
4,Useful,"I have found this lexicon useful because it is somewhat like Trench's Synonyms, but has much wider scope. It also includes antonyms so when considering the meaning of a word similar words and their different shades of meaning can be taken into account as well as the opposites. I would still recommend the use of another lexicon, like Bauer's to check some the definitions given."
2,Not enough guidance,I do not feel that this book offers enough guidance to form an effective program that would meet the needs of individual children. The author feels that the program that she has developed for her child is helpful and I have no reason to think that this is not true for her child.
2,No quite what i expected,Some of the songs from the movie were not on the CD and some of them were different versions.Not cool
4,Good.,"Good soundtarck to a good movie, it explores the dark tales of vampires, and no! it is nothing like Twlight so, forget Twlight!"
3,Tricks and Treats,"Like Halloween, the soundtrack has some goodies and some stale stuff in the 15 tracks, but is a decent bag of treats.Pantera (Avoid the Light) and Slayer (Bloodline) deliver a pair of strong songs, with Godhead (featuring Marilyn Manson on Break You Down) and Monster Magnet (Heads Explode) in the macabre mood. The other top numbers are from Static-X (Otsego Undead) and Disturbed (A Welcome Burden). An interesting cover is The Metro - a hit for Berlin - by SOAD and Linkin Park notched a hit single with One Step Closer.Though the drop-off from the top tracks is oftentimes steep, the album is a good stand-alone snapshot at the hard rock/nu metal scene."
5,MANSON AND GODHEAD,"NOBODY MENTIONS THE SONG TITLED: BREAK YOU DOWN. IT'S A GREAT SONG!MANSON MAKES THE SONG PERFECT!IT'S MANSONS STYLE.IT'S SONG NUMBER 6 LISTED HERE.IT ONLY NAMES GODHEAD.ON THE SOUNDTRACK COVER IT'S SONG NUMBER 6-AND IT SAYS GODHEAD FEATURING MARILYN MANSON.SO,ALL YOU MANSON FANS-BUY THIS SOUNDTRACK,AND CHECK OUT SONG NUMBER 6!"
5,In response to the vampire music loving guy..,"I like vampire music too but.. uhm, this isn't a vampire mix.. it's a SOUND TRACK. Since there was so much variety to what I'll admit was an HORRIBLE movie, constant vampire music would not corrispond to the scenes. It wasn't a real dark movie like interview with the vampire.. I remember it being a lot of action.. and as i said, the vampire music wouldn't corrispond. If you're looking for vampire music, it's true, this isn't what you want, it's just a great mix of music ;)"
4,Missing Song,"I don't have this cd but i would buy it if it had the one song from the beginning of the movie, it definatly wasnt a rock band and i wish i knew who did it because it was beatiful. Tooo bad they dont have it on here, Lovely song."
4,Great soundtrack,"This is a great soundtrack. one of the best out there today. With awesome tracks from Disturbed, Pantera, PM5K, Slayer, (hed)pe it's hard not to like it. This soundtrack sticks out particularily because not only does it have nu-metal (linkin park,saliva)It also has great legendary metal bands (slayer, Pantera)I highly reccommend this. Also great tracks from up and comers such as flybanger and endo. Hopefully Endo will get the respect they deserve at Ozzfest this year. Skip over Half- [...] and Saliva and you Have an awesome collection. Only problem : No Slipknot, Korn or Metallica."
3,Buy it for Pantera's Avoid the Light,As far as I know this is the only way to get this excellent track by Pantera. This was one of Pantera's final studio tracks and I mean it when I say it's one of their all time best. R.I.P. Dimebag. Metal misses you and Pantera.
4,My favorite soundtrack of all time...,Usually when you get soundtracks you only get maybe 1 or 2 songs that are good but every song on this cd are awesome! Here are my ratings on the songs...1. Ultra Mega 4/52. Welcome Burder 2/53. Bloodline 3/54. Metro 4/55. Heads Explode 5/56. Break You Down 2/57. One Step Closer 4/58. Avoid The Light 3/59. Ostego Undead 4/510. Swan Dive 4/511. Day by Day 2/512. Malice 4/513. Blind World 3/514. Sober 1/515. Your Disease 2/5
2,"Just download ""Metro""","Most of the stuff on here is rap metal. If you like that genre of music you'll love this soundtrack. If you like good metal, download the tracks by System of a Down, Pantera, and Slayer. You'll be happy you weren't suckered into buying the soundtrack like I was."
4,Wes Craven Shows Masterful Choices,"He's the acknowledged master of suspense who turns out to also be a fairly proficient audio designer as well. I haven't seen the entire film, but the trailers I've seen incorporate snippets of the soundtrack -- and it meshes perfectly. There's hardly a misstep on the entire CD; Linkin Park's ""One Step Closer"" is a slammin' track. Godsmack with Marilyn Manson was a little jarring at first, but is rapidly growing on me. This is a good one, folks. Hardcore enough for the true believers, yet accessible enough for the novice. Damn near perfect -- missed only by a hair."
2,I am not very much to hardcore,"I have seen previews and can not to go see it,but I will probably on video better because if I need to get up I can and all I would have to do is press play on the remote.From seeing the previews from the movie, the movie looks like it is going to be a lot than the c.d. or tape. I have found that to be true on several movies."
2,Great machine for first 2 years,"I echo the findings of the other owner whose machine had a broken plastic gear after 2 years. Worked great, then nothing-to expensive for repair."
5,Excellent Purchase! Easy to figure out and use!,"We ordered this for work and it was easy to set up, does everything we need it to. It's great!"
5,Brother MFC 8220 Review,"This was a replacement machine for exact same one I'd had for 5 years. We had a power surge from a lightning strike, so had to get a new one. Liked it before - performed very well in all aspects - so I ordered another one."
1,Gathers dust on the Floor...,"I have never gotten this machine to work properly. The screen keeps saying ""Selection & Set"" and beeps angrily at me no matter which button I push. I did get it to dial a fax number a few times, but each time when the other machine picked up it just sat there and didn't take the page or transmit. Nor is there any way to hang up the fax, so after the other machine hangs up you have to hear ""if you'd like to make a call, please hang up..."" I can't get it to do a damn thing and neither can anyone else who's looked at it, and yes we've read the manual. I'm sorry I bought it online, otherwise I would have taken it back months ago-- packing it up and toting it to the post office is such a huge pain, so it's been gathering dust in the corner. Maybe I just got a bad one, I don't know, but from now on I think I'll buy big stuff like this from a place where I can take it back easily if I have problems."
2,2 years and out,"We have had 2 brothers MFC machines the latest was MFC-8220 the one before was the same, I am not sure it had the same number but both worked well as a fax and laser printer for 2 years before a plastic gear broke. Both machines had the same problem in about the same length of time."
