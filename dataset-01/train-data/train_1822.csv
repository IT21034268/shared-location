2,Not For Older Kids,"I have to say, this game was definitely not what I thought it would be. I was pretty disappointed. I do like the fact that you can make your own species of dinosaur, but that is about it. The graphics need a lot of work...they are very unrealistic. But I just think the whole game itself is very bla. I think it's becuase there is only one focus of the game, which is to take care of the dinosaurs and attract guests.Don't get me wrong though. This is a really good game for younger children that are learning how to use a computer. But as for older children, they would get bored with it quickly. I would suggest spending your money on another computer game like Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis or Zoo Tycoon (1 or 2). They are much more challenging and realistic, and overall more fun."
3,Over rated,"Keep in mind several things. #1.The Nadi book is over fifty years old. #2. Nadi was not built like 90% of the people in the modern day United States. After all, if you are 5' 6"", it is impossible to play basketball in the same style as Wilt Chamberlain. #3. Nadi did not have the advantage of hundreds of different modern types and sizes of grips, shoes, ect, . . ect, . . Master Nadi's book is so hard to ignore because he was THE best fencer AND had such a black and white view of technique. It will always make you wonder if you are doing it right and will make you question anything else that may work for you. You could also argue that this is a good thing. In my opinion,the Master's book should be used as a valuable supplement,but not as a substitute for modern methods."
5,Brilliant,"Excellent book. My experience is not in fencing. Nonetheless, Nadi's book can be applied to most martial arts.What I found most interesting were Nadi's views on training and mindset.The chapters ""Intro"", ""Pre-Combat Exercises"" ""Combat Exercises"" and ""Competition"" are among the best martial arts advice-on the topics-- I've read.Antonio Bustillo"
4,the forgotten treasure,"Everybody loves Earth Wind and Fire-how could you not? The album,""Spirit"" ,however is one of those classic albums that seems to be known only to hardcore EWF fans; everybody seems to buy ""That's the Way of the World"" and the Greatest Hits collection and then go on about their business.I was lucky enough to grow up with this album in the house (on vinyl!!!!!!!),and even though the great song ""Getaway"" is included on the greatest hits, no true EWF fan should be without this album. ""Imagination"" is worth getting the album for all by itself!(only one of the most beautifully arranged love songs ever performed by the group-and they never do it in concert!) Songs like ""On Your Face"" and ""Saturday Night"" are funk 101, and ""Burnin'Bush"" is a moving ""message"" song with a gospel feel to it; the entire album is solid."
2,Negative Reviewers are Right,"I bought this machine to replace my old cassette-based Panasonic that had finally died from incessant telemarketer calls.The AT&T's set up was easy and all the features work, but the sound quality is unacceptably low. I hardly recognize my own voice on the recorded message, and callers sound as though they are speaking from under a blanket. Pity AT&T didn't consider improving the sound quality for a few dollars added to the price."
4,Its an answering machine..not an MP3 player!,"I've had this unit for 5 months and have had no complaints. Its a good little basic machine that gives you your messages when you are away. The battery backup feature is great. This unit was one of the few machines that were working for me in the aftermath of Hurricane Isabel.Yes, the sound quality is not top notch; but who needs concert clarity on an answering machine? I guess if your friends mumble...I also like being able to set the rings at a reasonable 5 or 6 before the answering machine kicks in--plenty of time to race to the phone if you are anywhere in the vicinity. Color me satisfied."
2,Cord keeps falling out,The phone isn't too bad except that we have to hold the cord or it falls out in midsentence. We've tried different cords and we have the same problem. Plus even with the battery backup I have to reset the time and date a lot.
1,Disappointing and short-lived,"When we purchased the phone in March, 2003, we read a very positive review of it. It did not live up to the review, but others have expressed some problems quite clearly. Other problems with ours were:It lost the time and had to be reset regularly; it lost the recorded voice message on the answering device, even with a battery back-up. The ring could be made shriekingly loud, but the caller's volume increased very little.It also worked for only a year and a half."
1,Garbled messages,All the features work great. It's easy to use and easy to program. The only trouble is you can't understand the garbled messages.
4,PLEASE RELEASE THIS IN THE US!!!,"It's a crime that is this film isn't available in the US. It's head and shoulders above the usual tripe in this genre. A smart, subtle take on the slasher film with well-drawn characters and excellent cinematography and direction. See it now, any way you can!"
5,Very Good; Left me wanting more.,"The movie was very good. It left me wanting more and low and be hold there is more. It is a prequel to Alien. I am giving a five because I do not know what they could do to make it better. The acting was good, story was good, special effects, everything was good. Defiantly the best scifi movie of the year."
3,Just so so,"it was nice to hear the director and actors talking about the making of the movie, but more detail would have been nice."
2,Did not care for it.,"didn't like it or the movie, I saw it before when it was called 'Alian' . One of my favorite movie of all time along with 'Alians' they should have stopped right there."
3,It's okay,Very disappointing in the movie now. Plenty of great effects but not a great story or acting or anything. Just thought it would be much better.
2,Wandering plot with characters you will not care about,"First, I love Mr Scott's work. This was a beautiful film, visually this was superb. Other than that, it was terrible. The 'scientists', if we can call them that, make ridiculous mistakes and decisions that are completely out of the realm of logic for anyone with any sort of scientific background.And it doesn't stop there. The cast all are good in the roles that are completely inane and foolish, leading to numerous dumb decisions. And the film just falls farther and farther as the clock ticks by."
2,Just squeaked the tolerable side of entertaining...,"Big hype, huge premise and an unfortunate miss.This film brings very little to the sci-fi movie world. Such a compelling subject and here we go .....fast food theatre....for the attention deficit CGI starved. The Prometheus relm does not set the bar very high for any sequel film expectations. This is not billed as part of the Alien franchise, oddly enough the only notable scene in the movie was the engineer getting suited up and sitting in his H.R. Geiger designed seat. A purely original shot used in the first Alien film. The first Alien movie was and still is an outstanding piece of work! Otherwise Prometheus falls short in establishing it's own presence in science fiction originality. A more intellectual approach to this paticular subject would not be unwelcome. Save the B movie antics for another film."
4,Discover Prometheus,"Ridley Scott never disappoints, whether its his films or the dvd commentaries which are ripe with behind-the-scenes details that are almost a film school on a disc. I've read a lot of kvetching about this eye-popping sci-fi drama but I find Prometheus to be a compelling, thought-provoking experience. And the Blu-ray package is worth every penny."
1,"Good movie, but this is just a trailer.","Anyway, I watched this movie in the theater. Good one, I like it. But this is just the trailer. I think you guys give a wrong impression to people that this is the full-length movie."
4,NOT THE STEAMPUNK BAND!,"Just a note: this band is NOT the Steampunk band called Sunday Driver. Actually, I think the Steampunk band is called Sunday Driver UK (they are British). This is also NOT the band THE Sunday Drivers, which is now defunct but also has excellent music.What this band is is sort of alternative rock, kind of reminds me of Mad at Gravity (which is also defunct...why do all the really good bands go defunct?) Anyway, I would recommend if you like alternative rock. Just don't get confused about WHICH Sunday Driver band this is! I did...but it turned out to be a happy accident, as I really like this music."
4,Wonderful Alphabet Book,"I really enjoyed this book. It is an alphabet book, but it begins with a few quotes from a few musicians. It set the tone of the for me showing the importance and value of having music in your life. Each page is designated for one letter in the alphabet. A capital letter and lower case letter are shown, as well as a statement relating to music. Adjectives are scattered on the pages describing the instruments, artists or genres discussed. I also love the illustrations. They look like collages printed in bold, rich colors. There are not bright ""happy"" colors in the book though. There are a lot of blues and purples. Overall, I would recommend this book. It is a quality alphabet that exposes children to the world of music."
3,meh,"Coming from a very musical family, we thought our daughter would enjoy this book and that it would be helpful for introducing her to new musical terms and ideas. However, there isn't any sense of story, nor is there a rhyme scheme. It's helpful for alphabet purposes, but could be so much better. Furthermore, in an attempt to find a musical term for each letter and be diverse, this book has a few really bizarre words that need pronunciation guides. Oh well..."
2,M Is for Music,"Disappointed, it was at the same time too general, with little focus.There are other, better books about music. The illustrations are good."
5,Warm and Dramatic Tchaikovsky,"Pappano's warmly dramatic approach to these performances has left me consistently wanting to hear more. Very well recorded: I have to strongly disagree with the other reviewer who states that Pappano's breath is constantly being heard; I have not encountered this problem, not at all. The brilliant quality of the digital sound with clean separation is unsurpassed, and along with Pappano's accounts, these are by far the best versions currently available in terms of both performance and sound quality. The outstanding wind soloists of the St. Cecilia orchestra adds distinction to each symphony; the horn solo in the slow movement of the Fifth is not just refined in its delicacy, but also intensely meditative. These are the recordings that will have you marveling afresh at Tchaikovsky's mastery as a symphonist, a quality that is under-appreciated. I only wish that Pappano and the St. Cecilia would complete the cycle."
4,"the Whiskey is good, in this Leonard Western!","This book is a typical western stand off with twists, Leonards characters are on point as ususal"
3,trivial nick from amazon,"Game arrived on time and in very good condition. 2 children ages 7 & 9 and 3 adults 36, 36 and 69 played together. The 7 year old and the 69 year old did the best but considering how much time the 2 children and their great aunt spend watching Nickelodeon we could not answer many questions. I hope a regular kids Trivial Pursuit will be more fun for them."
2,book,"not really what i had in mind- I did not need a life support system,i was looking for REAL live goals in Nursing jobs. as we have to have 3 for each year for evals. it can be like better communication-but must be specific on how you achieve this with your patients."
5,This size is difficult to find and moderately priced.,I like to stock up on this for storing photos to send to family and friends. I prefer the 1GB but they are no longer available.
1,"This camera has an internal memory, so there is no need for this memory card, even though it was suggested it WAS necessary !","The memory card was opened, of course to insert, and no place to insert. Therefore it cannot be returned.I am sure the memory card would work fine in a camera that needed it."
5,Lasts a long time.,"I've been using this for years. It's been so long, I don't even remember. I've been on long vacations, taken over 600 pictures and never filled it completely. I take a lot of photos and regularly transfer them to my computer. I've lent the card to friends. It's been in drawers, on tables, In backpacks and purses, and still performs like new."
5,Why spend money on expensive SD Cards?,Why would you want to spend 2x 3x 4x times your hard earned money for a popular name on your SD Card when this card works wonderfully. If you are an average amature photographer or one that takes photos as a hobby this is the card for you. I use these cards in my Pentax K10D and K100D and shoot RAW and JPG shots as many as 100+ a day and have never had any problem with these cards. They are not High Speed but if you are not shooting more than 3 burst shots at a time they are just what you need.Faster cards are good if you need them but let me tell you unless you are a professional shooting studio shots you do not need to look for the newer faster cards at 3 or 4 times the cost. You have all you need here in this Transcend TS2GSDC memory card.DanS
5,Worked perfectly,"I had a very specific use in mind when this was purchased. - The need for this product was specific to the ""technical specs"" of the product. It was described exactly as to its capabilities, and performed flawlessly."
1,Rip-Off,"I ordered 99 of these..only $64!!Then I found out I was being charged $492 to package up ship 99 in a box about the size of a deck of cards, to my home.WOW!RIP-OFF to the power of 100!!"
5,Great Price,"Great savings and price, may even buy 2.Price: $1,772,767,261.98Sale: $1,268,210,425.88You Save: $504,556,836.10 (28%)"
5,PLEASE PLEASE link this to the Fisher Price Kid-Tough Cameras!,My wife picked up a Fisher Price kid tough camera since I was getting nervous with my 3 year old becoming a shutterbug with my DSLR! brought it home and couldnt get it to work :(realized I had put an SDHC card in it and that was causing all the problems...yeah!This card worked perfectly and now this little camera can take a million pictures before we have to delete any for her to keep clicking away...very very happy daddy.
4,Cheap storage for sharing data,"I use these Transcend 2gb cards for sharing data with friends. Except for emergencies, I think the card is too slow to use in a digital camera - it takes too much time between shots. For digital photography, use a more expensive hi-speed Lexar cardLexar Professional Series 16 GB 300x UDMA CompactFlash Memory Card CF16GB-300-381. But for general storage and sharing data, these cards are much cheaper than a flash drive with the same capacity, and they can be mailed in a regular first class envelope. Haven't had any problems with reliability so far, but at this low price I wouldn't be surprised to have to return an occasional defective card. BTW, these cards come formatted as FAT, so you may find itnecessary to reformat as FAT32 or NTFS."
1,sd memory cards high tech savings,defective product. seller and manufactures say life time garuntee but will not honour it and communicate well enough with me.
2,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for","I purchased this SD card before a long awaited trip to Europe. My seller was excellent, I recommend them to everyone. The product, however, is a different story. I pluged the card in to my Kodak camera and I was ready to go. The card captured all pictures and videos. The problem is the only works in the camera or on my laptop. None of the Rite Aid, CVS style instant developer machines read the card. The machines just say no media found, and yes I went to more then one machine. The is a hassle, because now you can only order the prints online and wait days for them to come. Oh well, I guess this is what happens when you cheap out."
4,great memory card!,"Great Price, Great Product, and Great Quality. Received it quickly and it is exactly what I was wanting!!!!! I would recommend this to anyone"
1,Don't buy this card,"Don't waste your time; buy any other brand. Three cards (two replacements), and none of them work. Tried to work with a Transcend rep, after Amazon requested I try to work with them to format/diagnose. After a few things didn't work, Transcend just quit responding to me."
4,Great value!,"I can't believe how cheap these were! I know there are more well known brands, but so far these work perfectly well. I hope they last."
4,Old school memory card for NON-SDHC compliant devices,"My mother-in-law has a printer and an old digital camera that she loves. Problem is, she doesn't have a lot of space for taking pictures. Well, her equipment is not compliant with SDHC. I had to find a memory card that would do the trick. This cheap little gem worked perfectly. I only knock it a star because the speed could be a little faster. This is only noticeable when transferring pictures to the computer though."
2,One Worked One Didn't...,"One worked great... the way they are supposed to. The other one will not delete any pictures... it keeps coming up with an error code saying the parameters are incorrect. So now I am stuck with pictures on the card until it runs out of space then I guess I will have to throw it away... We have several company cameras each with their own memory card all of them until regardless of brand worked perfectly without a problem ever, I wasnt even aware SD cards could have problems... With the 50/50 performance I will not purchase Transcend brand SD cards in the future."
5,GREAT SD card,I loaded a ton of pictures on the card for a photoframe and every one displayed and looks great. Works well.
1,You get what you pay for,"After less than two months of light use this product has failed -- My cameras report a memory card failure, and it won't take a low level format. Based on this experience I would avoid this brand and this seller. Seller -- if you're out there -- want to send me a replacement that actually works? I didn't think so."
2,shows 2gig only loads 1.1 gig!,"Disappointed, This card only holds just over half of capacity stated. No amount of formatting or other tricks work. Purchase at your own peril."
2,2 GB Memory card,"It works great in the camera, but when I put it in my laptop to download the pictures, it tells me I have to format it. I don't know why, but it is annoying. SO I have a bunch of pictures that I cannot download to my computer."
1,very disappointed,"I searched high and low for"" Never Had A Love Like This Before"" and found it here on this CD. Unfortunately this version is recorded"" live ""and does not fullfill the rich sound of the studio version."
1,Live version - very disappointing,I would gladly trade in this live version for a studio version of Tavares if there is one available.
1,Boring,"I don't know of Wollheim's claim to fame, other than as a graduate student he helped A. J. Ayer in his writings. Be that as it may, this book (and everything Wollheim has written) is so droll and irrelevant to the philosophy of art. I suspect he is trying so hard to be anglo-analytic in his approach that he forgot that art touches the heart as well as the mind. Wollheim focuses entirely on the mind, and the mind games that ensue do little to enlighten one's understanding of art and its objects, what and why they do what they, and why they're important. This book was used in a course I had with Wollheim as a lecturer; both could not have been more boring and banal. The book was widely resold as many students didn't bother to read it, or began to read it and gave up. The consensus was nearly unanimous in irrelevance to the artist especially, and no less irrelevant to the philosophy students."
3,Leaves you begging for more...,"Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes are one of the great forgotten soul groups, one of those groups with a distinctive sound that the listener knows...but has no idea whose sound it is. It was, of course, the sound of Teddy Pendergrass, before the jewel-bedecked Love Man phase and before the tragic injuries...back when all the man had was a voice that wouldn't quit. Buy this CD if you must, but know that once you do you'll be back for the more inclusive If You Don't Know Me By Now package, which is far superior."
3,Pretty good and not too expensive!,"I bought this camera to make sure that if I dropped it in a puddle or a river it wouldn't break. I also wanted it to be able to withstand minor shocks. It works pretty well but sometimes seems to want to flash and then will not, so it won't take a picture... It also seems to drain the battery too quickly!"
1,doesn't work well,Performed very poorly underwater. Hard to use controls and know what you are doing underwater.
1,Disappointed!,"Other reviews did indicate the fact that this camera is hard on batteries, but I did not realize how hard. With the included batteries I was able to take 3 pictures without flash. New NiCads gave me about the same result. New rechargable (fully charged) Nickel Metal Hydride batteries did somewhat better, but still gave me only about 1 hour of use (still with no flash)."
1,Spend an extra 100 bucks for something decent,This camera sucks! The quality is so so soooooooooo bad. IF your just looking to save some money by buying this dont! It is just a waste you will wish you spent an extra 100 bucks for something way way better. The camera is cheapo plastic the quality sucks.....EVERYTHING ABOUT IT SUCKS...
4,"Wholely speaking, it's nice",I think most tracks are nice but I regretted a little since some most favorite songs are not included. But the price of the whole album is pretty cheap.
5,Had to have it the music stuck with me!!!!,"I watched vids on youtube and discovered the song Path feat - Sandra Nasic (lead singer of Guano Apes), and Bittersweet feat - Ville Valo (lead singer of H.I.M.). I was obssesed with Path and than Bittersweet got stuck in my head. After I got the Cd I've become obssesed with Hope feat - Matthias Sayer (lead singer of Farmer Boys). But all The songs are really great even Seemann though Till Lindemann (lead singer of Rammstein) isn't singing. But really check it out Apocalyptica are super great cellists if I had lots of mulla I'd pay to have them at my wedding with lots of other people of course!!!"
5,Hubby loved it,Bought this for my hubby and he said it totally rocks. He is amazed at how cellos can be so rockin'! Definitely a good purchase.
4,Good can be just as fake,"I'm reviewing to add that this album is excellent, though it was a sleeper for me, having it for a month before I could even try listening to it a second time. The last BR album I had bought before this was ""Mia Vita Violenta..."" which I liked pretty much instantaneously. I guess that means that the two albums are pretty different. This album has a fairly consistent tone and sound, much like their first album. Feedback, distortion and jangled melodies give rise to Sonic Youth comparisons. (In fact one song has a chord progression that sounds just like a SY song, though I can never figure out which song.) The thing I like the best about this album is that it's packed with raw agression and energy and doesn't loosen its grip. If you like that, then I HIGHLY suggest PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, which sounds a bit like an ambush by rocket launcher."
3,Sometimes better,"3 1/2The jagged beauty exuded in earlier work is on full display here, applying a Sonic Youth-like dissonance they are so often accused of stealing, but molding it into more grooving, less-consciously battering and anti- for the sake of it, forms."
4,"Turgid, emotional rock in the Sonic Youth vein.","Picking up where Sonic Youth left off, Blonde Redhead craft a turbulent blend of noise and pop on their third album. Composed of two Italian brothers and a female Japanese guitarist/vocalist, Blonde Redhead use alternating female/male vocals to great effect. Only slightly noisier than their previous release, ""La Mia Vita Violenta"". A must for fans of modern noise-pop."
3,The least of the Blonde Redhead catalog.,"Least lovely, least exceptional, least consistent, just least solid all around. Even at the peak of my BR obsession, I rarely listened to this album all the way through. My guesstimate is that after their first two more Sonic Youth-y albums the band was deliberately trying to change their sound, to move their unique song structures closer to something a little more rocking. Note the guest addition of Vern Rumsey from Unwound on this album. The album is more aggressive than the earlier two, but doesn't seem to go far enough. (After this album BR seem to more actively embrace the pop element and tweak their sound around that center, to wonderful effect.) But despite all my gripes, I must concede that there are some fantastic moments on this album - specifically the amazing ""Symphony of Treble,"" which is still one of their best songs and which could be reason enough to snatch this disc up. But trust me, get everything else BR put out first."
3,A Whole New World - and lots o' fangs !!,In the future - fangs rule! Those belonging to both vampires and werewolves. I like the vampire genre but am always curious about how the power shift came to being. Inserting a prologue that described the current state of affairs would have set up the storyline. I had a hard time fully appreciating some characters' anger and frustration not knowing how and why LA is ruled by different species. The storyline went along fairly well only going over a few speed bumps. But the end was quite unexpected and that was pleasantly surprising. I would have liked a bit more of a love relationship between Fleur and Dain other than the push/pull and yearning/deny. I have the remaining books of the series and am looking forward them as well.
2,"Selene, wait Fleur... bleh","I'm only about 40% thru this book on Kindle, but I don't see myself being able to finish it. There's nothing here worth finishing. The entire storyline is almost a complete rip off of Underworld. The difference is that no one here is interesting or even remotely likable."
2,Crimson City,"Los Angeles is now the city of fallen angels. Humans are no longer dominant. Were creatures and vampires run the world in a style reminescent of the mafia. Once, Fleur Dumont was destined to rule her family, but was denied her birthright until tragically, the two brothers who took her place are killed. Now, she finds herself working with a human to stop the forces that killed them. She should not even be friends with Dain, much less feel the way she does about this man. They are meant to be enemies, not lovers.** You will want to read this book quickly, for you will be anxious to see how it ends. It has a hard edge and fast pace that will appeal to a broad range of fans. If William Gibson wrote vampire stories, this might be the result. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,"Predictable, derivative","So much for something original. I saw this story on the big screen. It was called ""Underworld"" - vamps, dogs, humans, and the thread that runs thru them all.I had no idea when I bought the book that the author was a ""romance"" writer. Less than 50 pages into the book I figured it out. The hero is a female vision of a hero. The heroine(s) the same. More specifically, a romance writer's vision of a hero.I much preferred the Pyrn series for strong female characters.I can't imagine any reason in the world to read any other books in this series."
4,Very interesting; different; much suspense,"This book is not so much romance as it is paranormal (vamps & weres) suspense. The romantic relationship between the leads was not particularly potent, except for a scene in which Dain asks Fleur to do something huge for him. The reader who saw Marius' potential relationship as more compelling is probably right.Still as a vamp book and as suspense, it's great. This book kept my interest throughout, and I'm eager to read the next installment of the series. Don't expect a great romance; you won't get it here. But if you like vamp stories and suspense, this will maintain your interest."
4,Great Book....love the series,"I really enjoyed this book. The whole series is a great concept.I only have one complaint about this book. I love the characters, there just was very little sex.The plot is great, I don't read romances just for the steamy scenes, but this book could've used more of them.This is a great intro to the series though. I liked the female lead, she went through alot of changes. I love a strong female character and she was definitely the focal point(in my opinion)."
2,Romance absent...,"I read Liz Maverick's previous novel, ""Shadow Runners"" and against my better judgement, tried this novel. I can only say that she must have a ""thing"" for a main character letting his/her main squeeze be beaten or killed without intervening. Sorry, but if the main character, in this case the female vampire, lets her ""love"" get carted off to be beaten and doesn't interfere, even though she has the ability to protect him, this is just not recoverable as a relationship. I don't know what was going on between the two main characters, but love and romance it was not."
5,Great Concept!,"Vampires in skyscrapers (they fly!). Humans on the ground. Werewolves in subways. Three species and mistrust grow between them when vampires are being killed off.I really enjoyed this book. It's action-packed, with a strong hero and heroine. Being a set-up book, it works on many levels and I can't wait to see what happens next, since everything is building up to a gigantic showdown between humans/vampires/werewolves and maybe even demons."
2,There is no way to turn it off.,"The user interface is bizarre - keep the manual handy, because random pushing of buttons can land you in some strange places.Their customer service confirmed that there's no way to turn it off. Maybe you should just leave the battery cover off, and the battery out when not in use?All I wanted was something to measure cumulative power usage. There are other meters that do this much more intuitively.(as for calibration: I ran it for 2.5 hrs monitoring a light with a 60w lightbulb, it measured .163kWh, which comes out to a 65.2 watt bulb. Whether the bulb was straying or the meter, I don't know.)"
4,Good for what it's worth,"I've had and used mine for over 2 years. I'm happy with what it does. Of course this is not a precision piece of equipment and should not be looked upon as such. As for the complaints of not being accurite using a light bulb, take them for what they are worth. There is no proof that the bulb will actually use the amount of power that it is rated for. The bulb will use more power on startup and less over time. It takes a bit more to light the filiment then to keep it lit. Bottom line is this product does what it is supposed to do. It gives you a ESTIMATE of the cost.Jon KC9AXZ"
4,Great tool for the price,"I've had the cost controller for over 2 years now and have found it to be a valuable asset. Until measured, one never knows just how much power an appliance draws both in the on and off states.Pros:Battery power means it holds the info if you can't see it when its plugged in.Allows calculation of cost of power usage.Cons:Buttons are difficult to pressAlthough it does only have two decimal places for the tariff cost, as stated in the manual, you can assume .08123 cents to be 8.12 within the tariff feature to calculate the cost in cents and do the conversion to dollars.As for the battery, I've had mine on for over 2 years continuous and it still functions as it did when new.Always check power consumer in both on and off states. Sometimes the off state is still a large consumer of power."
1,It SUCKS! Do NOT waste your money!,Bad wrestling.Unfunny pranks/jokes.Skanky girls.And not once did they show Puppet the Psycho Dwarf pee his pants. I heard he does that a lot when he's drinking.
5,this phone is really cool! It's a must buy!,"I have actually had this phn, for a couple of months. The features are great and the color is different in a great way. The dual keypad is really helpful. I'm now looking for a second phone for my bedroom, and am considering getting another. I have not had a problem with this phone to date. Great look and a great price. I give it two thumbs up!"
1,Poor handset sound quality,"I bought this phone assuming that I could not go wrong buying an AT&T phone. Alas! Compared to other phone brands I used (Uniden and Vtech), this phone has the worst handset sound quality. The handset sound becomes overmodulated that I could not understand the other party. My ears maybe sensitive. So far, I didn't have the same problem on the speakerphone. I returned this unit and changed it with a Uniden. Has more features (caller ID) than this phone and at the same price."
2,poor sound quality,As i move around my apartment the phone would buzz and hiss. About 9 months after I got it loud cracking static could be heard even when I am close to the base unit. The sound quality is very very poor.
2,You get what you pay for,"This phone is fine for receiving phone calls. There is a reason it was only $40 for a 2 line cordless phone -- it is not a tone phone, but a pulse phone. If you call a business that has an extensive voice mail phone tree, you can not get the phone to recognize your entries, unless you remember to put in some code in the process of the phone call. So . . . in short, if you need a 2 line phone for receiving phone calls only, think about this one. If you call businesses that instruct you to dial 2 for customer service, etc., spend the extra money and buy another phone."
5,groundbreaking (to say the least)..,"this is one crazy mess of a masterpiece, and i love every minute of it. imagine the sporadicity (is that a word?) of don caballero, minus almost any sense of rhythm or key, and there you have it. definitely one of the most unusual albums i own"
5,Very Fun,"This is a very fun game, and if you like the original, this is worth getting. There is an error with the game though if you don't download a patch from the website(30 day manual check)."
4,OMG,I love this game and lost my first disk so I had to buy another one. Well I am in the middle of playing and it keeps asking me to the word on page XX paragraph X wordnumber X and it didn't come with a manual. This was a trial version and that never went away even after putting in the correct word mulitple times!! The seller contacted me with just don't write a bad review but nothing we can do about it!!
3,Per comment,"Per the comment of the last person, No it is a completely new game. a sequel so to speak. Yes it will work on XP"
4,Revealing,"I love Fleetwood Mac & Say You Will is one of my favorites of their recordings. I also love when artists share their process & let you in to see the decisions & details of how it all happens. Destiny Rules is a great DVD revealing this insight. I wish each scene was longer. Knowing there is 500 hours makes me want to see much more. Favorite bits: hearing Stevie's demos of her 4 new songs, watching Stevie & Lindsey come up with vocal harmonies, hearing real conversations between friends & band members with so much at stake, hearing the writers stand up for their songs & having last say on the arrangements. Non musicians think the band plays & sings the song & they're done move on to the next song. But making an album is like making a film & there are thousands of things to decide & narrowing down infinite choices is the art. (Now release the DVD version for musicians we can take it.) Lauren Passarelli ~ Guitar Professor, Berklee College of Music"
4,Great Companion to the Album and Concert DVD,Who wouldn't be fascinated to see the making of one of the band's greatest albums? This is an enjoyable documentary for new and old fans alike.
1,"""Full"" solar kit is not full -- buy it directly from solarstyle",This model number on the solarstyle website has a connector for an ipod. The one that amazon is selling must be an older model because it does not include this. That must be why it is cheaper. Very disappointing.
1,Charger? or $35 LED flashlight,"This product is yes - ""nifty"", yes - ""versatile"", but only if it works. Mine has not worked, although it does charge (proven by the green flashing light), and does ""output"" apparently (proven by the blinking red light) ... my Ipod has not received a single bit of charge. This could be a multitude of problem with either the connecting cable, the device itself who knows, but either way this review is coming down to Customer Service that has yet to respond to any of my emails, calls, smoke singals, and other forms of communication. Dead silence, means i give this product a dead star.Good luck with yours though - because if mine does work one day, i'll be happy to have a solar backup for the devices that can be connected to this charger.Oh and the LED flashlight is very bright and cool, and it does work on mine."
1,I DO NOT recommend this product,"I had so much faith in this product. I wanted it to work so badly. Unfortunately, I can't urge anyone to buy one. The Universal USB replicator connector doesn't work with any devices I own. The car adapter does work, but within 30 seconds of my cell phone registering a charge, it said it charging was complete....when it really wasn't. It took 3 hours to charge up my friend's phone with direct sun. It took 4 hours to charge up ONE PIXEL in the battery icon of my Microsoft Zune. I should have read more reviews on this product because I bought 5 of these and in good faith that they'd work like a charm, but now I'm stuck with them."
1,Horrible.,"I don't recommend this product to anyone. It didn't charge my Shuffle, or iPod, or iPhone, or Samsung phone. It charged a friend's Mini at a scout camp (we were staff,) for which he was eternally grateful. My shuffle didn't last, since I couldn't charge it. It does charge my eneloops, through the USB adapter, so all is not lost, but still... not as powerful as I was hoping. Don't buy it. Get something better."
1,What a disappointment,"Although the concept sounds great - this is a piece of junk! I ordered mine straight from the manufacturer, and right out of the box the battery would not accept a charge from the sun or wall charger. The LED flashlight would only work when the unit was plugged into the wall charger. Unfortunately there was nothing stored to transfer to my iPhone!I am still waiting for a response from Solar Style's customer service. Given the previous reviews, I am sorry I wasted my money on this charger. I plan to do some more research and maybe try another one."
3,"Cool premise, bumpy ride (this title describes entire series)","I read the entire Crimson City series, even though the first book (also written by Liz Maverick) was just average. The second and third books were stronger and really pulled me in. As a whole, this series has been a bumpy ride.It's my understanding that this is the final book in the series, and that is my main ""gripe"" with this particular story. It was not a satisfactory conclusion and left me feeling frustrated. Several plot lines involving secondary characters went nowhere, and the conclusion to the story was really rushed. When you read sci fi, you need to be able to suspend belief. This story just went too far for me in that respect--there were too many things pushed at me without enough information to back it up.For those of you wanting to read a really outstanding set of books (the quality of each book--and one was written by Maverick--is very good) then I would recommend you read the Banzai Maguire 2176 series."
4,Futuristic engaging read,"This futuristic story has an engaging main female character with an interesting male hero. Some light sexuality and a few mild violence scenes. Fighting back from being captured by a sub world demon, the independent heroine must make her way back into an altered society while she is attracted to a man with added capabilities who wants her help."
4,A whole new world,"At the beginning I was a little lost, but the story sped up and open up to a whole new world. Where Vampires were the rich, Werewolves were the rogues, the government was hiding behind walls, cyborg want to be human and Demons were literally hell on earth. I loved how Finn the cyborg mech is on the run and only wants to be considered human. It doesn't make him weak, but his emotions make him even stronger. Then there is Cydney who escapes hell and the demon who wishes to control her. Now these two have to save each other and Crimson city from the devastation of the demons. This is a suspenseful romance that kept you on your toes throughout the story. I truly enjoyed it."
4,Crimson City Rocks!,A very good series but I have a major gripe ~ Marius & Jill. Yes they were minor players in the 1st & last book but I wanted to know more about them & I wanted my happy ending for them! Too bad there aren't anymore books coming our way because theirs is a story that needs to be told.
2,Pretty Dissappointing,"After reading Liz Maverick's first book in the series I wasn't going to buy the last one, as a romance writer she sucks and should stick with Sci-fi, but I have to give her some credit the main heroes in this story wasn't too bad, but why even stick in Marius & Jill's story, it made is seem like there was another book in the works, it ruined this book for me, and I will never buy another Liz Maverick book."
3,DVD Buyer Beware,"Unfortunatley I can only give this DVD transfer 3 stars. I have been patiently waiting for this film to be available on DVD so that I can toss out my old videocassette. Instead I think I am going to keep the videocassette and toss out the DVD. MGM's high production values are evident throughout this film. The special effects, for their time, are convincing even by today's standards. The problem with this transfer is that it is too ""heavy."" The facial tones are all ""plugged up"" and the shadows are way too saturated. I know this movie, despite it's somewhat contrasty sytle of cinemetography, was not originally shot (exposed) that way. Even if the original negative is permanently damaged this fine film is deserving of the most expensive, time-consuming restoration effort money can buy."
5,San Francisco The Movie,"I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Jeanette MacDonald fan. I have been a long-time fan and this movies does not disappoint. For an old black and white movie, the earthquake sequence is pretty awesome considering that the special effects people then did not have modern technology to help them create the earthquake destruction. To old movie buffs, I think this is a movie you would enjoy."
2,Overrated,This must be one the most overrated movies in the history of film. Extremely simplistic sentimental plot. Gable and MacDonald have zero chemistry (Gable did not like her at all personally) and Macdonald's prima donna presence combined with her irritating singing (which there is WAY to much of)just flat out destroy this film. I'm sure the 30's audiences must have loved the special effects which I will admit are superb. Maybe this is the basis of what all the acclaim was about. Gable and Tracy are good but are given little to work with. Gable turned the role down repeatedly but was finally convinced by the studio somehow. If you want some real 30's Gable entertainment see any of the movies with he and Jean Harlow.
4,Great b&w film,"Great video, good story, but can be a little annoying at times. (the woman can't make up her mind) But I love it!"
3,Yes and No on This One,"Yes: The climactic earthquake scene, with all of San Francisco just toppling to the ground, is a tour de force of 1930's special effects. Spencer Tracy plays a wonderful priest--I think this was his first role with a turnaround collar--and his shock when Gable will send MacDonald out on stage in a skimpy chorine outfit is one of the emotionally intense moments of the film. Gable delivers one of his usual rogue performances, one of those ""I don't believe in God, I believe in me"" kind of fellas, and as usual, he does it expertly. No: I didn't believe in the romance of MacDonald and Gable for one minute, and you'd need about one hundred and twenty minutes for a movie like this. I don't think she could attract him, and I certainly don't think she could hold onto him. It's not that she isn't a beautiful woman; it's just that there was no chemistry between them at all. Check it out--I doubt you'll feel the earth shake over them at all."
4,"Cast correction -(DVD, 2006) listing","Just correctig some information in the listing..... Liam Neeson is listed in the cast of this movie. Not sure how or why he's listed but, he isn't in it, nor is anyone named Neeson. Check IMDB for correct cast listing."
3,Virtues and Weaknesses of the MGM Machine,"""San Francisco"" (1936) contains a memorable Clark Gable performance and some classic special effects from MGM's Golden Age. The depiction of the 1906 earthquake and its aftermath remain cinematic highlights. Unfortunately, the lavish melodrama is saddled with glaring flaws: excessive singing and limited acting by Jeanette MacDonald; a romantic storyline worthy of Popeye, Bluto and Olive Oyl; the great Spencer Tracy relegated to a thankless supporting role; and the tacked-on ""morally uplifting"" conclusion. Even though the MGM gloss mars a potentially great film, it's still worth seeing."
5,same category with the Godfather (#1),"San Francisco: originally viewed it at 13 years old on TV; the continuity of the story never faded; the story line never waned nor did the stars; of course, Jeanette MacDonald was stupendous and so fittingly corny; Clark was a true Blacky; and Spencer Tracy was great; its effects are up there with all the new flicks; Its too bad it can't be rated today--sure it would measure up in all categories of a great film: Stars were great; story was great; story continuity steadfast like the Godfather #1. Both San Francisco and the Godfather are truly great productions where all artistic talents came together to creat a masterpiece."
4,San Francisco,"The pairing of Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy works well in this classic story of the era of the San Francisco earthquake. I loved seeing Clark Gable as a passion filled rogue with a heart of gold. Of course, Jeanette McDonald sings beautifully and portrays the shy moral country girl perfectly. This is a movie I was glad to add to my collection."
4,San Francisco,"I remember seeing this in the theater. I liked it then as entertainment, but I appreciate watching as a far more mature person now. I would recommend the movie for the treatment of the San Francisco earthquake. The filming which mixed footage from the actual quake and staged filming was particularly satisfying. Also, how can one resist the uplifting and poignant song, San Francisco,sung by Jeanette MacDonald at full voice, not to mention, Clark Gable being Clark Gable, yum."
3,moving,"Eactly what I was looking for, I was able to pull of my old cassette and replace with this one change my gear ratios as desired.The construction is fine, hard enough to stay intact, yet not so hard as to eat chains."
5,9-speeds and a really good wide ratio...,"This cog set is 9 speeds, and goes from 11 teeth for the top gear to 34 teeth for the low gear. It's a nice wide ratio to cover everything from steep hillclimbs to high-speed downhills. Watch out for clearance to the derailleur wheel, as 34 teeth is very close to the max for deore shifters. Works flawlessly for me."
3,It's A Nice Clock,"Would have rated it higher if it was backlit all the time. While you CAN hit a backlight, you have to be careful where you place this as it's hard to read without that backlight on."
4,Terrific debut,"Great record.Sweeping, intense, emotional & occasionally violent instrumental music brought forth by violin/guitar & drums. ""Dirty Equation"" is my equal favourite ending to any album ever (along with ""Wall"" by Shoji Hano & Munehiro Narita's Kyoaku No Intention).Live they are pretty good, I recall seeing them on their Ocean Songs tour & the definite highlight of the night was an incendiary merging of Indian Love Song/Dirty Equation as the sets closer.Anyway I do think critic's have blinkers when it comes to this band as I find a lot of their later output meandering. I am definitely more attracted to their more intense moments. In fact I'd love for them to go in & make a full on apocalyptic sounding record. More guitar please."
4,Good,When I was taking a Diploma course in Logistics this book came in very handy. To this day I still read it.
3,Some of these chips are too small for a large dog,"I have a large dog who makes short work of these chips and I had high hopes that these would be just the thing after reading the reviews. However, I was disappointed to find a number of tiny chips in this bag that my dog could swallow in one gulp. Will not be buying again."
3,Ok,I stopped giving the rawhide chips to my dogs because they just didn't digest them as they should. We had one pet that had problems with his stomach and spent a couple days in the vet hospital. We didn't know for sure if the rawhide chips were the culprit but decided to stop giving them to our dogs anyway. The dogs did enjoy chewing on them so I was sorry to have to stop but there are other products that are healthier and better for the pets than rawhide.
5,Great resource even if you live there.,I gave this guide to my parents who just moved there. They say it is a great resource for them to find places to visit. Very well written and descriptive.
4,John Fielder's best of Colorado,The book is excellent for the important things to see in Colorado. However it needs to be updated in terms of lodging and restaurants.
5,Best Guide Book to Colorado,"Number one Colorado getaway guide. Colorado has much to offer in the way of scenic day outings as well as weekend jaunts therefore, it's somtimes difficult to choose a new place to explore, especially if you are limited on time. Fielder manages to highlight Colorado's most interesting and beautiful places and presents them to you by region. Great, to-the-point summaries and terrific photos. No book is better whether you reside in the Rocky Mountain state or you're simply visiting and taking it all in in a mere week or two."
2,Not so great,Yawn --- a poorly edited listing of places and businesses. This is NOT the best of Colorado. Spend your money on some other Colorado book.
5,"Great ideas, photos and history","Nice book, lots of ideas for people who have lived in Colorado for short and long periods of time. Photos are always great as this is a specialty of this author."
4,"Always Ritchie,always good,just not the best.","I would have to agree with the first review of this ,which stand out to me as it being ""Darker""than the other Blackmores night cds,Ghost,fires at Midnight,under a violet moon,etc...Dark is ok,cos I like dark music..............but nothing really stands out that makes me really want to clap and get into it,like ""Lorely"",or ""Diamonds and rust"",""all for one"",""The Storm""etc..There are some great cuts as usual ""Guess it doesn`t matter"",St.Teresa,Just call my name,and fairie queen.But the slower songs,and instrumentals just seem re-hashed or a little bit more boring,than say ""BENZAI _TEN""<or ""possum goes to prague"">All in all good listening>just think riitchie and candice should take maybe a year and a half off or two to come up with some fresh ideas<they seem to be drying up a bit with all the cover tunes"
1,Bad Hybrid,"I have finally given up on Blackmore's night. I had hoped the mix of Deep Purple (great!) and Fairport Convntion or Steeleye Span (both great!) would result in a magical mix.Not so. This, again, is just too boring. A wate of money, as are their other albums."
3,Not bad but too much,"When I think of pampering, I think of kicking back and relaxing. If I have to work too hard to get to this point, is it still pampering? This is a decent book with good suggestions but if you are busy, you may want to get to a spa or a good massage school for a discounted massage. I see where Debrena is going with her suggestions and I was enlightened to read about chakras and aromatherapy. If I was going to go into this type of business, this would be and XLNT book but for the SBW or any other woman this may be a bit much."
3,"Sublime horror, Baudelarian sensuality.","There are some beautiful things in this book--I stole the pumpkin layer of one cake for my own creation--but each recipe contains more than a pound of butter, sometimes not including the icing, and some have more than a pound of chocolate. I drooled, I trembled, and in the end, I couldn't bring myself to spend the money or the fat grams to make any of these from start to finish. And I like to think of myself as a fan of extravagance. Inspiring, but daunting to all but the most sybaritic. There should be a sequel called ""Desserts of Evil."""
5,"Amazing product, amazing seller!","I ordered this with a 4 oz. bottle of chocolate extract from the same seller, and I am very impressed with their dedication to providing a quality product. The package was shipped quickly (I ordered on a Tuesday night and I had it on Friday afternoon via USPS Priority Mail.) and everything was wrapped securely and accompanied by a note sincerely thanking me for my order.This is one of the best vanilla extracts I've used. As soon as I take the cap off of the bottle it fills the immediate area with a wonderful aroma. I'm very pleased and will definitely order this from this seller again."
1,BRILLIANT SERIES Abysmal Quality!,"I've owned the UK version from Network DVD and I now own this Image release. The UK DVD isn't great but at least it's from original film!This disgusting release from Image is from a Video tape source off the 16mm print. The Image frame is missing information on all sides, you can even see the ""blue warping"" on the top edges of the frame! There are video tape glitches all over the place, and why they licensed the series and not the original masters, much less attempt to restore the original 35mm negative, is beyond me.Completely disgraceful release of a wonderful series with excellent acting and would SHOULD BE beautiful cinematography."
5,Adventures of Black Beauty: Season 1,"I love horse shows,I grew up on Black Beautyand Dotor Gorden's familyfor years. I was very happy to seeit again on dvd. It last forver,andBlack Beauty saves the day with thechild as well. Amy is a good house keeperthat just love's the family!"
1,Disappointment,"This book was a true disappointment. The first chapter held some promise that an exciting, unpredictable storyline would be woven throughout the other chapters. But, that did not happen. There was little interest generated in the almost one dimensional characters and it was obvious throughout what would happen next. There was no subtle presentation of the two complicated sides of the Palestinian-Jewish conflict. The book was a series of predictable and over simplified events."
4,International thrills,"See storyline above.I think Daniel Silva has done it again. Written a gripping and serious spy novel, that is. Although not as intense as his previous novels, The Kill Artist takes a top seat in the international spy genre. This international thriller, with well molded characters, will take you all the way from the Mideast to Paris and from London to Canada. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is the main player in this book and Daniel Silva knows this topic well. The only problem I had with the book was the lack of gut wretching suspense that I come to expect with this type of novel (I guess I expected Ludlum). Still, a good spy novel with great characters and timely subjects, gives this one a high mark.highly recommended for the serious international thriller fan."
3,"world tour of bad ""guys""","An incredible writer who takes you to places that are the hot spots for terrorists- One almost forgets that you are reading fiction. Having read all of his novels, each is five star and spell-binding. Not necessary to read in any particular order but it helps at times in order to understand the Protananist and his foibles. Love him."
4,I'm enjoying The Kill Artist,Good book - I'm almost finished. I'll be reading more books by Daniel Silva.
2,not worth all the hype,"Daniel Silva is one of those authors whose name gradually becomes familiar. I decided to pick up some of his novels after hearing favorable reviews on his latest book. I have just finished the Kill Artist and it was......OK. In my opinion, it took a long time for the plot to develop, halfway through the book I was ready for some kind of action. I also soon grew tired of the flashbacks and wanted the story to progress in the here and now. The novel did improve near the end but by then I was just slogging through the thing.Hope the next one I read is an improvement."
5,It's Silva but then its not,"I loved The Marching Season and Mark of the Assasin, but this just doesn't seem like Silva. Don't get me wrong I'm a HUGE Daniel Silva fan. I love his common sense detail and easy to follow plots in the past. This novel borders on everything he's created in the past with characters and places. A few of the previous characters are there but hopefully he'll bring back the painter-assassin from Mark of the Assasin and The Marching Season. The story line was a little hard to follow at times, esp. the flash backs, but none the less a great read.Basically this is a good book. If you like Silva you'll buy this book anyways. If you've never read Silva then you'll definately want to buy this book. Reading time is about three to four days, but definately worth it. Can't wait for the next one."
3,Slow start,This book was a good read. It took a while for me to get into because of background of Gabriel. The beginning seemed to be a tad confusing. It picked up the pace once Ari comes into the picture. I never suspected the ending and it was a real twist to me. I hope the next book is a bit quicker of a pace than this one.
3,Kill the Artist,The book held your interest but kept losing track of names there was such a variety of them but still it was an interesting story line
4,"Nice thriller, but not perfect","This is my first Daniel Silva book, having ""found"" him since I'm a Vince Flynn and Tom Clancy fan. I enjoyed the book and its plot. However, the reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is the following:SPOILER ALERT!it seems implausible to have a beautiful French model be a Mossad agent. Even more unlikely is the fact that she is willing to cheapen her body and sleep with her ""target"" when necessary to complete a mission. We were told that this happened numerous times throughout her spy career.the second thing that bothered me was near the end, when Jacqueline escaped from Leila. There was no reason Tariq would keep her alive once he crossed the border. Furthermore, Leila, as an accomplished PLO field agent, couldn't have been so stupid as to let Jacqueline go to the restroom with the door closed. That's just not believable.anyways, I will read his next book on the Gabriel Allon series. Cheers!"
3,This was a strange way to tell a story,"There may be some spoilers so beware if you read this. This book was very well written , but the plot and characters left me very angry and confused. The hero of the book could very well have been the terrorist , he outsmarted the supposed hero every step through out the entire book even at the end. The terrorist was also fighting for a cause were has Gabriel and shamron were basically doing it for themselves and Shamron was a lying coniving bastard the whole time. And last but not least the love interest of the hero was a whore how where you supposed to develope a liking for her while she was banging a terrorist the whole time it was just weird I wanted her to die. The only thing that saved this book was it was well written and the hope the next one is better."
5,Killer of a Novel,"This book is the first by Daniel Sliva in his Gabriel Allon series, although I didn't read it until I had read two of his later ones in the series. If you're new to Daniel Silva, it is helpful to read this one first. I found it captivating, and wish I had ordered the hard copy instead of the Kindle version so I could share it with friends. If you like international intrigue, you'll enjoy this one."
3,Entertaining but disappointing,An entertaining spy procedural that went completely off the tracks at the end (beginning was good enough that the end was very disappointing). The non-procedural (personal) parts could be quite plodding. Sorry to say that I won't read the rest of this series.
2,"""What's the Big Deal?""","I have reached Chapter 15 and am putting this novel down in frustration. I want an agent, editor or publisher to tell me why this book has gotten such good reviews. Each chapter has a new cast of characters who, more than likely, tell their story in flashback. Who wants to keep a roadmap of the cast of characters?"
3,"Quick, Entertaining Summer Reading","I was really excited about Daniel Silva after finishing his excellent WWII thriller ""The Unlikely Spy"". However, his subsequent books have been uneven - ""Mark of the Assassin"" was OK but bordered on copyright infringement on ""Patriot Games"", while ""The Marching Season"" was virtually unreadable. So, I got scared off from him until my Dad loaned me this pleasant surprise. Again, nothing groundbreaking, but at least the characters are well-rounded and the interpersonal conflicts are interesting. Also, the Gabriel Allon protagonist has the potential to be a good franchise base - the duality of assassin and art restorer has the makings of many interesting reads."
2,Not a good book.,"Silva at times, made it hard to take this book seriously.I don't understand how Silva (or his editors) could think a popular supermodel who has dominated the fashion industry for 10 to 15 yrs, could be a viable candidate to be an UNDERCOVER spy.Also, the staging of the final confrontation was clumsy and predictable.This is just not a good book. Bordeline sloppy."
5,Great book!,"Latest in the series about Gabriel Alon.Problem is, now we have to wait for the next one."
3,"Good effort, but anticlimactic.","This was an interesting and informative spy novel involving Israelis and Palestinians. Not a new topic. The main issue I have with this book is that even though entertaining it is predictable all the way thru. This creates an anticlimactic feeling when you are reading because you always know what is going to happen next.It does introduce Gabriel Allon, a very interesting character that comes back in many of Silva's other books. This is one reason why I will give Silva another try, the other reason is his fantastic debut novel ""The Unlikely Spy"", the talent is there, it just did not quite worked this time."
3,Well-written story but the plot is very simplistic,"After having read Silva's first book (""The Unlikely Spy"") I thought I had found a great new talent in the action/thriller genre. But if ""The Kill Artist"" is any indication I think Silva has lost his touch.His writing style is still very good, but the plot of this novel reads like something out of a guide to writing a best-seller. ""Unlikely Spy"" was much more sophisticated than this.Because the style doesn't match the simplicity of the plot I'm giving the book three stars."
4,Intro to Gabriel Allon,The Fallen Angel was my introduction to Silva and his character Gabriel Allon. After finishing Fallen Angel I immediately sought out the first book The Kill Artist. I'm hooked.
2,finding it very hard to get into the story,I'm about a third thru the book and I'm still finding it hard to really get into the story and I'm having to push myself to keep reading.
5,Wonderfuld series,"Daniel Silva is, in my mind, the best author of mystery/detective fiction. His books are complicated, the people seem quite real."
5,Another winner by Daniel Silva,Loved the book. I recommend this book to all who like adventure and who enjoy seeing the good guys win.5 stars
4,The Kill Artist,I enjoy reading about mystery/thirillers and an a new fan to Daniel Silva's work. Really enjoyed his writing style and and looking forward to reading the rest of his books about Gabriel Allon. I always start with the first book in a series and try to keep them in order so I can continue to get to know the characters better. Anyone who likes a good spy novel will be in for a treat.
3,"A Rollercoaster, in two diffeerent ways...","This book is truly a rollercoaster!! The plot similar to the popular amusent park thrill ride because it keeps you on the edge of your seat through an array of dips and turns. Unfortunately, the writing style is also rollercoaster-esque. When Silva is on his game, the writing is brilliant: smooth, hilarious, and affecting. When he isn't (which seems all too often during the middle chapters), the writing is choppy and predictable. I'm a humongous Silva fan though, believe me! His plots have always been easy to follow and The Kill Artist is no different (Definitely a plus!). Hopefully, Silva will keep producing easy-to-follow thriller novels but will keep the rollercoasting to simply the plot, not the writing style as well!!"
4,Where's Michael and Delaroche,"This was an exciting, interesting, thriller, well worthy of four stars. However, the book was a dissapointment to me, since it was nowhere near as good as either of Silva's previous efforts. The main characters in this book simply can't compare to Osbourne and Delaroche, and I think he'd do better to resurrect those characters than to stick with Gabriel(which, unfortunately, he appears to have done for his next book). Also, why have Peel at all if you aren't going to develop that story, and why set up the whole Gabriel/Jackie thing if it is going to fizzle out as it did."
3,Slow Motion Plot With Decent Twists,"The Kill Artist is a mixed bag that is worth a look, at least as a paperback, depending on the reader's patience. This is the fourth Silva novel I've read. He continues to portray colorful settings and develop rich/complex characters. I also enjoy the links he established between the four books. Over time I forsee the 'six degrees of Daniel Silva.' While his plot twists leave nothing for granted, you must wait a very long time between key movements in the story. I found it disturbing and put the book down a few days. The main character restores artwork with extraordinary patience. As reader of this yarn, you need to have the same trait."
4,a page turner,"I thought ""The Kill Artist"" was a good blend of fast paced action, a decent level of historical/political intrigue, and engaging characters. Though stylistically not the level of Le Carre or Greene, ""The Kill Artist"" reaches the level of works by those writers due to the pathos and world weariness of the characters. I enjoyed it more than enough to want to start the second in the series without delay."
4,Your better-then-average spy chiller thriller,"A good read. It starts slow, but really finishes up strong. Good, unexpected twists. Your better than average spy chiller thriller."
5,The Kill Artist,"Another great read by Silva on theGabriel Allon character. Some days are just too good to spend on work, so this is when a Gabriel Allon book enters the picture. Allon is the go-to man when a necessary job needs to be done; he acts with finesse, courage, and honor to make his space better for all. I just hope that he stays on our side."
4,Great suspense book!,"I couldn't put it down and naturally, I loved the tie in with restoring paintings, because I am a painter.I devoured this book!"
4,the Kill Artist,"I have become a Daniel Silva fan and I enjoyed this book, but it was not one of those books that you feel like you can't put down/stay up all night types. His more recent books are better."
2,A Flawed Worldview,"Let me start by saying that I did not finish the book. I made it about 2/3s of the way through before I put it down. It was not that the book was boring; the story about terrorism and counterterrorism was somewhat compelling. The problem was with the characterizations, especially of the protagonist, Gabrielle Allon. I read this book based on a recommendation of the author by an online pundit. I think I know why he recommended the author; his worldview, at least as it comes across in his blog, is pragmatic. This is a pragmatic book. There were no ""good guys"" in this book; there were no heroes. The message of this book is that to beat the ""bad guys"" we have to become like them; we have to become ""bad guys"" as well. This is a thoroughly pragmatic worldview, and it left me feeling ""slimed"". Perhaps if I had finished it I would have discovered something uplifting. But life is too short sometimes, and I have other books to read."
1,Too Expensive,"Can Amazon explain why you can buy the book for 7 dollars with the added expense of printed pages, while digitally with very low overhead it is $10? I like my kindle but will continue to frequent local bookstores unless Amazon can be more reasonable in their pricing of older books."
2,Perdictable,"The book was well written. The subject matter was typical when it involves Israeli spies vs Palestian spies. Israelis are the good guys, oh so clever, Palestians the not so noble ones. The Israelis are the butchers that are just misunderstood in their search for peace.The Palestians are a miserable lot of complainers just because their families have been killed and their land stolen by the Israelis. The Israelis are the heros and winners. Who would have thunk!Doug Wallick"
1,meh...,"fact/research heavy.slow.not that much happens.not that good.a few nice twists at the end.better than ""A Death In Vienna""Ken Follett gives a fairer shake to both sides than DS"
3,Roger's 1st solo album,"Roger Taylor was the first member of Queen that worked on a solo project. The eighties marked the change on Queen musical style and this album is more oriented to the use of synths. Although Roger never reached the Freddie Mercury level of writing/arranging songs he is characterized by simple but nice songs, so don't expect a great album.Interesting is the fact that Roger plays almost all the instruments in here (guitars, bass, drums, vocals and some synths, 50% of them by David Richards as stated).This is a cd that you probably only play a couple of times of a complete way but with some enjoyable songs to hear tough. Recommended to listen: Future Management."
4,Precise,"I was torn between 3&4 stars for this since I find myself not using this rule often, but I have to give it its due. It is mostly well made & precise. It is fragile, not to be thrown in a tool box with hammers & the like. It's a layout tool, as such I miss that it lacks 1/64"" markings & holes. I got it to accurately mark lines around adjacent perpendicular surfaces. I can only do this on the one end that is not part of the 6 inch scaled section. The other end at the theoretical zero has a ragged edge with exposed half width holes & slots remaining from manufacturing cutoff that the .5mm point proper size pencil snags in when trying to mark around corners. I use the Incra 6"" T rule 50 times more than I do this & kinda wish I also bought the 3 inch T ruler despite it also missing 1/64"" markings which the 6"" T rule has. I wish the 6"" bend rule were made with 2 smooth continuous surface ends. Might give it a 5 & use it more."
5,Excellent Precision Tool,"Superbly accurate and precise tool. Until you actually use it, you will not believe the accuracy with which you can mark lines. This is not a tool you dump in your tool box. It is a precise instrument that has to be handled like the precise instrument it is. A case is highly recommended."
3,AlertMaster,"I bought this item, on a recommendation from a state agency rep, for my son who is severly hearing impaired to help him wake up in the mornings. So far the couple of times he's used it it didn't work. The vibrator isn't nearly strong enough to wake him up even when placed under his pillow. This might work if you are a light sleeper. There is also the option of plugging in a lamp to turn on along with the vibrator that might help if awaking when it's dark. For heavy sleepers this might not be enough to rouse you."
1,Cover states plans--book contains NO plans,"If you do not know what a plumb bob is, or how to mark a chalk line, this book will be of great value. If you are looking for plans to build a shed, buying this book is similar to paying for an order form.This will show you from the ground up how to build a shed, yes. However, one must pay another 15-30 dollars for the actual plans, despite the covers boast of ""special section: 33 Great New Plans!"". Reason #298 why to look at the book at a real bookstore before buying, too.If you know how to build anything, you may see this as a waste of time/money."
4,Good book for getting information,I bought this book for ideas and tips. It is a handy book that I used several times for information in helping decide how I want my shed to look. Getting a kit from the local supply yard would be quick and easy but also plain and boring. This provides an option to get away from plain and boring
3,Book Costs,This book can be bought off the shelf at both Lowes and Home Depot for $8.95...usually Amazon is cheaper????
3,Great Designs; Hard to Find Colors,"Zoe Mellor's designs are so wonderful because of the color combinations she uses. She writes what brand & type of yarn she used for the projects; but then just uses general color names -- NOT the manufacturer's name. Example: writes ""green"" , but manufacturer has multiple greens with different names. Also since the book was published, many of the colors (once deciphered) are no longer available...Great wonderful designs -- be prepared for footwork to find your own combinations of colors that will work."
3,Mushroom bag really just a laundry bag,"Mushroom bag really just a laundry bag. If I knew that's all it was, I would have just bought one at Walmart!"
4,Gift for Mushroom Hunter,The bag does what it's intended for; it spreads mushroom spores as you walk through the woods. It's not glamorous - it's functional. That's why I like it.
1,Where do you live?,"I live in the mid-west, Michigan. This gardening book focuses on gardening in the south west areas in a dryer climate. I would not have purchased this book if I had known this. There should be a review stating the plants are more conducive to that area.Most of the plants she recommended did not appeal to me."
5,Muddy Muddy Muddy,What can you say about Muddy that hasn't already been said? He's the greatest bluesman and the greatest musician that ever drank a bottle of whiskey. He proves it again with this album. This album carries the same level of greatness as his earlier Chess releases. You can't go wrong with this disc.
4,HARDLINE,"Muddy says 'The Blues Had a Baby And They Called It Rock And Roll.' Then, he let's us know, he's a man, not a 'Mannish Boy.' With James Cotton on harp. Muddy Waters is truly the M-A-N. All this leads up to the Muddy Mississippi 'LIVE' Now, that's 5 stars"
2,Not what I was expecting,"This DVD is not what I was expecting at all. Some Death metal bands are represented but not nearly enough. Too much Black metal for a Death metal Documentary, i just don't see the point of it,You have inerviews from Mayhem,Cradle of Filth among others. No talk about Death or Obituary or any other main bands save for Cannibal Corpse and a little by Immoltion. Very cheaply made too,pass on this one. The short movie also included is a load of very tasteless and stupid crap."
4,Not a guide to the Book of Common Prayer,"As the other reviewers note, the meditations are very insightful and inspiring. The format is very similar to the ""Forward Day by Day"" devotional guide with which most Episcopalians are familiar. Instead of Bible verses at the top of each day's entry, however, there are short excerpts from the Book of Common Prayer. You can turn to the BCP for the full text of the collects, rituals, and Psalms, but references are scattered throughout the prayer book. I was hoping for something that was a little more of an organized guidebook to the BCP, with the added benefit of devotions."
5,"""Theo Van Boven"" The PRINCE of Human Rights Education","I have heard 'Theo Van Bovan' at the International Institute of Human Rights at Strasbourg. An Anthology from his work was much awaited. This book will be of great help to Academicians, Research Scholars, Human Rights Activists and even to United Nations Human Rights Commission. A cheaper edition of this book should be made available so that people from Developing Countries can benifit from this work."
4,It's not supposed to sound like Star Wars,"If you're not familiar with any of John Williams' concert music, may the listener beware. It sounds nothing like his film scores. It is dissonant, and often difficult to listen to. But it is usually a rewarding experience. What it lacks in melodic themes, it makes up for in colorful orchestations and moments of striking beauty. The third movement of Treesong is a good example of this. It begins on a note that seems out of place, but eventually resolves.Not everything can or should sound like Star Wars. Film music, by its very nature requires a differnet kind of writing. There is certainly room for Williams to write concert music in a modernistic style that departs from the Wagnerian influence of his movie scores. Oh well. If you prefer his soundtracks check out Close Encounters of the Third Kind; now thats pretty modern!"
3,"Shaham's Playing is Fine, But....","Diehard fans of John Williams's music will certainly want to acquire this CD, but fans of Gil Shaham's playing may not be disappointed either. Shaham's performances demonstrate much of the passionate lyricism I've heard from him elsewhere, shown to good effect in these three John Williams pieces. Unfortunately, the most successful is the concert suite from the ""Schindler's List"" score; the other works sound more like ill-fated efforts at conjuring Webern's, Schoenberg's, or even Boulez's music, than significant violin works belonging to the current modern musical canon. The Boston Symphony Orchestra is in fine form too, especially in the ""Schindler's List"" suite."
1,NO TRUTH WHATSOEVER,"Completly false, and I am delighted to see this slop falling into the garbage pile where it belongs. Robert Slatzer was never married to Marilyn Monroe, in fact he never knew her beyond the fan/star meeting on the Niagra movie set. Anyone who quotes Robert Slatzer in their bios on Marilyn are only perpetrating the falsehood, and proving they did little primary research. They paraphrased others without testing the validity of the information. This kind of fake, hack writing is a freak of our times and truly a disaster!"
1,The Life and Curious Death of Marilyn Monroe,"The book was fell in parts, pages are dropped off from the middle, too expensive for that condition !I could not read the book till I fixed page by pages to put together.Really disappointed."
1,This book is completely false!!!!!!,"After reading Donald Spoto's biography on Marilyn Monroe, I found out that everything in this book is completely false. Slatzer only met Monroe once, during the filming of Niagra, asked to have his picture taken with her, and that was the end of it. His claims that they were married, among other things, only surfaced after her death, in fact more than a decade later. All personal records of Marilyn do not show anything about her having any other contact with the author. Slatzer has made a fortune off of this book that has all false information in it. I do not recommend supporting him by buying it."
2,"Good information, but too incomplete.","This book has some good information, but is very incomplete. It does not even contain the deora car that is on the front cover and title page of the book!!! This book only lists mint in package prices and many cars have been left out. It also contains very little variations. If you are looking for a complete price guide, look somewhere else."
2,Wish this Guide was more comprehensive,"It is not clear in the description of this book that only a relatively small sample of Hot Wheels are featured and the only values listed are for ""mint packaged vehicles"". Because of these limitations, this book was of little value to me."
2,Close but no cigar,"Short and sweet: I'm not a Photoshop guru, but there was nothing in this book that I didn't learn from just playing around with the program. It's a good book, but for someone who is just learning."
1,Waste Of Money!,"This book didn't teach me anything that I didn't know already. I learnt a lot more by playing around with the software. It doesn't even teach you how to do impressive special effects, like montages or TV lines.If you have already played around with Photoshop, then you don't need this book! There are better tutorials out there on the internet and they are free!Save your money!!!"
3,Mi6 - Lunchbox,"Im gonna keep it short and get to the point. This cd is great but not as good as ""alcoholiday"". It includes some great tracks from ""alcoholiday"" such as ""lezbian girlfriends"" and ""Jeff brown"" and some new tracks. This cd doesn't live up to ""alcoholiday""."
2,HB134 not PC134,Illustration of this item is a Bosch PC134 (dark mandrel attached) but item sent was a Bosch HB134 (plain white cutter).
4,hole saw blade,the blade pictured had the quick connect adapter on it. When the blade arrived it was a plain hole saw without the quick connect feature. I had to order a kit to allow me to use the new blade with my current kit.It should be stated that adapters are needed to allow you to use the feature of quick connecting the blade to the shank that hooks into the chuck of your drill. Other then that the blade is a standard Bosch hole saw which drills fine and is easy to clean out debris.
2,"NICE LIGHT UP, LIGHTS INOP DEFECTIVE, NO DIRECTIONS","FOR SOME REASON RECON DOESN'T FEEL IT NECESSARY TO INCLUDE DIRECTIONS AS TO WIRING. ALSO, ONE OF THE LIGHTS WENT OUT 2 DAYS AFTER THE INSTALL...RECON WOULD NOT WARRANTY THE PRODUCT BECAUSE I BOUGHT THEM ON AMAZON.**SIDE NOTE: RECON WILL NOT WARRANTY ANY PRODUCTS PURCHASED ON AMAZON, EBAY, ETC... IT'S NOT SPECIFIED ON THEIR WEBSITE, BUT I LEARNED THIS FIRSTHAND."
4,LED Bed Light Kit,This light kit looks good and is really bright in the bed. One of the LED blocks was bad in the kit and I am waiting for Recon to send me a new one. Their warranty department was quick to respond to my issue and I look forward to getting the replacement soon.
3,very helpful,"These lights are great in the bed of my truck with a bak flip cover, even during the day the extra light is helpful and at night a must. I didn't give this item 5 stars only because one of the LED pods already has 3 out of 6 LEDs out after about 20 uses in 1 years time."
5,A Sweet Suprise!,"I was so pleased when I heard this CD. It shows a gentle side to Roger, sweet warm songs. The song ""Old Friends in Better Times"" a tribute to Freddie Mercury, is hauntingly beautiful. An Excellent CD. This CD shows Roger's versatility. A nice break from his hard rock CD's (which are gereat also).5 stars for this one. Way to go Roger!"
2,No Violins Here,"While this album does have a couple of shining moments, it's very weak overall. The lyrics are often cliche and the music doesn't have the muscle or edge that the two preceding solo efforts had.When you listened to the first two solo albums you felt that you were listening to something inspired. This album has no real focus and the music doesn't keep my interest."
3,"Good Voice, Good Disc","Roger Taylor is a great performer and songwiter, his unique voice and kind of singing make the best in this songs, I think isn't his best work, I do like most ""Fun in Space"", or ""Electric Fire"", but the Roger Taylor signature is definitly in here. The 12th track, ""Old Friends"" is simply beautiful, and directly dedicated for Freddie. if you like this genius go for it and buy it"
3,A bit to strange perhaps,"This one cant really be rated really but its not an album to get for most. Roger Taylors got some strong lyrics as he does usually however Rogers songs are more varied and stranger then ever, even then his mostly aggressive sometimes laid back songs in Queen. He does not sing on this album but speaks. SOme of the stuff here will really test listeners."
3,"""HAPPINESS?""...I was barely happy...","This album is basically a talking session, with songs being SPOKEN, rather than being SUNG. More political viewpoints than a US Senator and a bunch of dull drum machine work and synths. Not what I expected from Roger, but then again, he is rich enough to do what makes him ""HAPPY"". This album basically seems like a bunch of work thrown together to show his QUEEN fans that, ""look, I'm still here."" Buy ""ELECTRIC FIRE"" instead...as it is a completely different album than ""HAPPINESS""..."
5,Nice wood working ruler,Great product for straight and acurate lines for wood working. Just make sure you use a .5 mm lead pencil to get into the the small markings
5,Has helped my precision,"works as advertised, I have worked on several projects now with better accuracy and results. I bought several of the Incra measuring tools."
1,Very disappointed with this latest book,"I had been waiting for a long time for the next Jackie book and I was very excited when this book came out. After reading it I was very disappointed, however because of the ending or lack there of. I felt like I had read this whole book and was expecting it to all tie together in the end or at least get some answers but I got neither! It seemed to me that all this book was is a format that layed the groundwork and storyline for her next book. I will think twice before I buy another one of her books. It is really too bad because I had read every one of her books and loved each and every one except this one."
1,Truly terrible,"I was looking for a good ""trashy"" book to read- this most definitely is not it. I was appalled by the numerous Writing 101 mistakes Ms. Collins continues to make: outrageous, simplistic stereotyping at every turn; lack of any suspense whatsoever, and so on. I could figure out what her cardboard characters were going to do long before the author ""revealed"" it. Like ""Hollywood Wives"" (which I also bought for [price]), here's another complete time waster. However, it is good for a laugh..."
2,Disappointment Reigned Supreme,I have read all of Jackie COllins books to date and usually love them. I mean I would stay up until the wee hours of the morning to finish her books. With that said I have to say that I am very diappointed with this book. It was liek she was trying to hurry it along. She didn't expand on the relationship between Madison and Michael. Where is the author that wrote the Lucky Santangelo novels. That was great writing! Eve her last book Dangerous Kiss was kind of bad. Oh well I am glad that I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it.
1,but only because you won't let me give it zero stars,"Can we somehow get this woman to stop writing books? PLEASE! It disgusts me that in a typical bookstore, where the authors are alphabetical on the shelves, this writer-of-garbage gets to rub shoulders with the likes of Wilkie Collins."
1,This may be the worst book I have ever read.,"As an English professor I read all kinds of books, from the very best to the not so good. This may be the worst book I have ever read. There is no plot to speak of, and the characters are so one-dimensional that they seem to exist solely to allow the author to mention protuberant body parts. The author's writing style, to use the term loosely, is so cliche ridden that it infuriates. What a waste of paper and ink!"
4,Jackie never fails to amuse me....,"""Lethal Seduction was a great read. Jackie never fails to keep me amused with her plots. I will say that Rosarita is a twit and her husband needs to 'bone-up' on his people skills. I felt bad for Madison, however, with JC plots, these men are always abundant. I wished she had thrown in a bit of Lucky for us in this novel, but all-in-all it was a good read! Keep 'em comin', Jackie!"
1,Disappointed,"I am a Jackie Collins fan and just embarked on a reading frenzy. I have ordered a lot of Jackie Collins' books and just completed two which I loved dearly. However, I am having a hard time reading this one. This has got to be the worst of Jackie. Save this for when you have nothing at all to do and even then --you will find the time to do something else. Not worth it."
5,Very lovely and entertaining book,"It was a very interesting read, it had romance, drama, suspicions and more. it was a while since I read it but I highly enjoyed it, she'll leave you wanting more and with a lovely ending. The characters weren't predictable so thats good.one more impotant thing: Since you'll love this book do not be tempted to get lethal seduction:the prequel-> deadly embrace which came after it, because it was Horrible!!! it felt as if she was rushing to make a dead line, and she repeated every single thing and focused mainly on michael. It was a very annoying book."
5,Big Fan,"I am a huge fan of Jackie Collins. Anyone who loves any of Jackie's previous novels will love ""Lethal Seduction. Anyone who loves mystery, suspense and just a hint of love will love ""Lethal Seduction."""
2,May have taken 1 day to write,"Well, I have a secret guilty reading pleasure and it's Jackie Collins, especially during stressful times. BUT as much as I've enjoyed other books, the ""Lucky"" ones in particular, I frankly thought this one...[stunk]!!! I'm no prude (I don't think a prude would read more than one of Collins' books!) but this is 90% filler, with honestly boring sex chatter. Also WAY, WAY too many passages with things like ""Madison ate a salad for dinner. Then she took the dog for a walk. Then she returned 16 phone messages, first from ..., then from...,"" You get the idea? This whole annoying story could have been told in about 30 pages. Irritating, trashy, abrasive characters dominate the ""story."" Yeah the paperback is cheap, but if I'd known, I would not have bothered spending even a few dollars at the grocery store on this. I'm just annoyed that I wasted a few hours getting through it waiting for it to get better, which it didn't."
1,"give it up Jackie, Joan has you beat!","The real writing talent in the Collins family has always been Jackie's sister Joan, (see her reviews!) Jackie flounders for words while Joan just creates shear poetry. Here, this book is a rehash of other works by Jackie. Romance is dead in this opus, and it is extreemly disappointing to see Jackie reusing old plot lines once more. Here we have it all over again, the woman in danger, the man who may or may not be a hired killer, and another man who wants to save her... it's not just ""been there, done that"", the writing is a poor quality. The story drags on far too long and it's almost as if Jackie is begging us to put it down and go out for a walk. While Joan's prose is crisp and invigerating, Jackie wallows in conformity and boredom. The ending is practically a rewrite of ""Infamous"", a far superior work."
2,Not for Pioneer,"These would not work in a Pioneer DVD Recorder. They worked in a Magnavox, but part of the time I had top format them twice before they would work. I should have stuck with the Sony. They cost more, but I didn't have any trouble with them."
4,A Penny's Worth of Character,"This is something I remember reading as a grade-schooler and enjoying, as I have all of his books. Reading it again brought back some of this enjoyment. It is definitely more for young readers, though."
2,"More ""The Waterboy"" than ""The Waterman""","I enjoyed this premise the first time I read it -- as William Werner's ""Beautiful Swimmers"" (1976). In this malnourished copycat, Junkin milks his ""personal experience"" as a waterman (really only a summer job 25 years ago) and pads it with overdone prose and underdone plotting and character."
4,Wonderful descriptions of people who live off the bay.,"I thought the best part of the book was the descriptions of the waterman's activities. I loved the time spent on netting for alewives and pulling the sailboat off the sandbar. The author really portrays the love and beauty that a waterman feels for the bay. This book was like a ""Cold Mountain"" on the Chesapeake Bay. I really enjoyed it."
3,Decent movie that has some flaws,"Syriana is a movie that is set in the middle east and it deals with the politics of oil. Just like Traffic, this movie is extremely slow. It took me a couple of days to get through this one (just like Traffic) because it kept putting me to sleep. The movie is also slightly hard to follow. If you turn your head for a slight moment and miss one of the conversations in subtitles you have missed a major part of the movie. But once I finally got through the movie and got the full meaning of it, it was a decent movie. The performances of matt damon and george clooney were good as they usually are."
3,"its a good movie, but.....","I have just watched the DVD version of this movie and must say that its well acted and directed. Other reviewers already explained the story line and they did it well, so I will pass on that.What was not done well in this movie was the Arabic dialog.For us Arabs, we know that the language was spoken in a broken manner.Also the story is mixed between the Saudi's and the emirates(UAE).While the father of the Emir was set to look like a Saudi, the Emir and was set to look like a prince of United Arab Emirates.Come on Hollywood ! Next time you want to make a movie about Arabs, get a real Arab who know how to set up the language,the dialog and even the story line correctly.I am free for hiring."
1,Terrible excuse for a movie..,Here was George Cloony's oportunity to educate people on what goes on and the Movie was a total drag...Everyone I have talked to has had the same experience..The movie made no sense..no matter How many times I tried to figure it out. It was an effort to keep watching it to the end..a total waste of time and money..
1,Sorry George,"I love your work I will watch anythig that has you in it, simply because you are in it, and in my mind you are a fantastic actor. However this movie I could not make it through, three times thus far I have sat down to watch it, not including once in the theatres, and everytime no matter how loud the speakers, or bright the screen, I was unable to stay awake. I have not yet given up on it, but at this point in time I am forced to say this film takes you three stops passed the boresville station."
2,This movie is so tired.,"Let me say this straight out... the movie is fictional. For me to try and understand, truly understand, how corrupt business and politicians have hijacked our foreign policy by watching this movie, would be like trying to understand the dogma of the Catholic church by watching another work of fiction, ""The Da Vinci Code"".Are we Americans so stupid in our understanding of international history, and the currents and eddies behind world events, they must be explained to us through fiction? If so, we deserve our current predicament, which should only worsen our ignorance.I challenge filmmakers to educate us with accurate portrayals of history. OK, so these movies may not have headliner opening weekends. But truth will educate throughout the years, and a movie true to history will continue to teach even when it sits on the DVD"
2,Confusing and not particular noteworthy.,"If you're the type to be shocked by the suggestion that the U.S. government would meddle in international affairs in order to protect U.S. business interests - then you'll be SHOCKED by this movie.The plot was purposely jumbled, I think to create ""intrigue"", but instead rendered the movie confusing. Clooney's role was relatively small and not that challenging, and thus his performance didn't strike me as noteworthy. Any actor capable of looking frumpy and muddling through 10 or 12 scenes while looking ""serious"" would have done just as well.The best thing about this movie was the marketing. Give those guys a raise for generating so much buzz for this mediocre movie."
3,Syriana,Have not watched movie yet but doesn't sound to great. Not to crazy about George Clooney but my husban likes him
1,Boring and stupid,Its a copy of the traffic but its no where in that class. What you get is a series of short rather senseless stories that merge into a rather silly finish.I was happy when it was over and I could leave
1,"Liberal, liberal, liberal","Liberal piece of garbage. George Clueless does it again. For truly good movies, check out:Hotel RwandaPassion of The ChristWalk The Line"
2,Gorgeous George,"I hate to give this movie any rating because I just couldn't get through it. The film was visually dark, the actors mumbled, and the scenes were disjointed. Sorry George, you're gorgeous but this movie wasn't for me."
1,Too Complicated and Confusing.....,"This movie was terrible. I lost count how many countries characters were in. There were too many subtitles in the movie. Reading a movie, while trying to watch is annoying. Clooney didn't even seem to be the main character. The movie jumps around from character to character, country to country, and plot to plot. It lost me."
1,Boriana,"Who are these people? There are far too many characters and too many subplots. The characters motives are not explained. It all has to do with greedy Americans trying to get oil from the Middle East at the cost of human lives. Two companies, Connex (Connectictut and Texas, the Bush's home bases) and Killen, pronounced ""Killeen"" as in Killeen, Texas (Ft. Hood) merge and all kinds of people try to butt into other people's business. And the CIA is evil, as if we didn't know.Too long, too nonsensical, and too boring."
1,"Disjointed, non-linear indeed","I found this movie in the $5 bargain box (along with a bunch of other movies I had never heard of) at Walmart. Sad to say, I wasted my money.Writer and Director Stephen Gaghan tries to define himself for a new generation, but all that he delivers is an abortion of a motion picture.The best scene was when the main character was being tortured; as the viewer, I could sympathize as I felt equally tortured watching this movie.I actually laughed out loud during the extra features when George Clooney related how anxious his fellow stars were to get a part in the film (I wonder how they feel about it now).If you want taut, intelligent drama, watch Spielberg's MUNICH instead of this force-fed globetrotting disaster - SYRIANA is one of the worst films I've ever seen."
2,"Say, what?","In all fairness, I hate subtitles. Many films with them are tolerable because they are entertaining or informative or something. I found it too choppy to follow most of the time. I also found that I spent so much energy trying to follow what everyone one was saying that I often missed the point (if indeed there was one). The best scenes seemed to have nothing to do with the themes. Soy bacon was the highlight of the film for me."
1,coma-inducing and impenetrable,"Easily the worst film I suffered through last year. I loved Traffic. I own Traffic. I've watched it multiple times, and enjoy the layered complexity of the film and it's characters. Syriana, however, was the single most confusing film I've ever seen. When it ended, we were all trying to figure out what had happened, or what the movie was even trying to say. That oil companies run the world? Whoa! Big surprise there! Is there anyone who doesn't already believe this? If you don't, this movie isn't going to convince you, and if you do, then you're wasting what seemed like about 8 hours of your life by watching this flick, so do yourself a favor and skip it."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Syriana seems to be one of those movies you simply have to watch more than once, for upon viewing it I was confused about several of the storylines and characters; it feels a bit harsh to give the movie a negative recommendation on the basis of it being so convoluted, but remember that Traffic was similarly constructed yet one attentive viewing of it could lead to comprehension."
4,Clooney delivers,"This is another well written and acted, vehicle for Clooney, Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer, Jeffrey Wright and a considerable number of actors whose names suggest Middle Eastern descent. Imagine using actors who acually resemble or share ancestry with the people they're meant to portray. It's a thought provoking portrayal of, how the United States facilitates policy change, over seas, and the events surrounding such an occurrence. Though it's supposed to be based on true events I consider it an opportunity for the viewer to make up their own mind about how valid is what's being presented. It's definitely worth a look and can be loaned from virtually any public library or purchased inexpensively through Amazon or other retailer. It's also a nod to the increasing efforts of well heeled, established actors more than willing to bring their talents to films pertaining to important, current news topics, presented in an adult and sophisticated manner."
1,Too hard to follow...,"I cannot say that I did not appreciate the film and it's intentions, but for the common movie viewer Stephen Gaghan's work is far too complex. The movie, like his prior work, looks great on paper, but when it is finished it is a jumbled mess, that watching more than once will only serve to confuse the viewer even more. This film should be filed under art-house. It is a statement, not necessarily open to interpretation, but definitely not for the casual movie patron. The movie makes it's point, but the journey getting there hardly seems worth it. Raising more questions than it answers, this movie was just not worth the hype."
2,See No Evil... See Not this movie. very long film used to make a short political,"statement. ""Do what the US government tells you to do or else."""
2,BORING,"I rented this by mail, after an hour of disjointed scenes, I popped it out of the DVD player for something better. Like the late news."
1,Hollywood - thy name is evil,"The leftist, evil types that dwell in the toilet that is Hollywood have once again outdone themselves. Portraying terrorism as a heroic action and America as the great evil. The true enemies of this country are within its own borders - mostly isolated to the west coast and the northeast US. George Clooney and his type should be rounded up and executed for treason.Don't waste your time and money on this.God bless our troops. The hell with the scumbags of Hollywood and the Liberal, evil left of this country."
1,gobbledygook & self-righteousness & pretentious twaddle make for a terrible movie,"there is a certain new-fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound, then they ARE. the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable ""crash"", but at least that was (somewhat) assuaged by strong performances. this -- arguably the worst ""mainstream"" motion picture of 2005 -- is redeemed by nothing. an excruciatingly long 2 hours, and as much as i (usually) enjoy george clooney, i might never forgive him for this drek."
2,Syriana review,"I enjoyed this film very much! I think that it is a deep, moving story that takes it's time to set up but still kept me on my toes. Great cast including Matt Damon and George Clooney. Although fictional, it has some good points about it that carry through. The scope here is much broader than just ""big oil"" and even though it is a film that obviously tries through and through to paint the United States as the big bad wolf, it was worth seeing George Clooney get blown to smithereens in the end. It is okay though, because it is fictional. If you don't believe me just look up the book it is based on, because that guy has been proven to be nothing more than a lying schmuck who made stuff up in order for his books to sell as ""thrillers"". Hollywood ate it up though, and kept the lie machine rolling, question is, will you eat it also?"
1,wish I had my 2+ hours back,"This is the worst movie I have seen all year. It reminded me of Solaris, another Clooney movie that left me confused and wishing I hadn't wasted the time to watch the entire flix."
3,not what i thought it was...,this movie was such a disapointment!!!!it wasn't what i was expecting!!!well i rated with 3 stars and i have nothing else to tell about this :Poh i forgot!!!yeah...1. good casting2. nice scene when the little kid dies... (that didnt sound pretty) O_o i hope u get it ;)3. nice explosives i guess =)
1,"another BAD, BAD, BAD movie!!","The movie embraces ((typical Hollywood stereotypes)) it merely uses them for beneficial reasons! With arrogance and ignorance, it points fingers at certain groups in support of the media propaganda.It does not even deserve the one star I gave it. In fact I would give it an (F-) for its sick content, and false arbitrary accusations and generalizations. That it deserves!"
3,Interesting but Disjointed Movie,"The value of this movie for me was the emphasis on Middle Eastern culture and the variety of languages spoken throughout the film. If you are an international intrigue, culture or language buff, this movie will probably interest you. Otherwise, you'll probably be bored to tears. So, the three star rating I give it has mostly to do with being able to practice my Arabic! It was also kind of cool to see George Clooney speak the language."
2,Gagging on Gaghan,"Holy cow! Who pieced this film together? Dr. Frankenstein? It's as if two thirds of the movie was cut out before it got to production. Lots of logistical gaps and undefined characters left me confused at best. What the hell is Matt Damon even doing in this movie? His character was pointless and had no bearing on the plot. The young prosecutor (I guess) and his hapless father; what was the significance? Even Clooney's character at the end, waving the white shirt, had me expecting him to do or say something to save the prince, but instead, nothing! Bizzare...In two hours I saw hints of Traffic, Clear and Present Danger, Three Kings and The Insider in this movie. But what a lousy editing job. It's a mess. I have nothing more to say."
2,Not good...,"Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised. Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan. However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch.While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful. As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else. But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..."
2,Hold off on buying this 1st edition,"Definitely worth renting, but if I were you I'd wait until either Warner Bros or Criterion releases the deluxe edition. I've heard Stephen Gaghan speak in person on his film and simply can't believe he doesn't have an incredible amount of backstory and commentary to be expanded on a future dvd edition. ""Featurettes"" and deleted scenes - that's all you get here? Please."
5,The Pool is Deep,"Incredible weaving of four stories that all tie together. Gaghan brilliantly executed the telling of a deep story with masterey. The cinematography, score, storyline, and characters are well-thought out and well chosen. It's a deep pool that requires close attention. I've seen it four times and just now feel as if I'm truly beginning to understand all of it. Can't wait for the next Gaghan film."
3,Too much information,"This movie is perhaps a very good one, but it's difficult to show the idea from the director: there's a lot of information and it's hard to remember the facts. Great acting, great colours, smart production but...give me a break, you need a book to take notes"
2,Please stop making shaky movies!,"Is there a tripod shortage in this world? Why is everbody and his brother making hand held movies that shake so much that it makes my dizzy? Also, why do people go for these disjointed movies? Does it make people feel smart that they can understand the story? This movie reminded my of Babel. Both movies sucked."
2,Review,Sound sucks. Plot sucks and hard to follow story.How hard is it to produce a well known plot? (Oil companies own the governments of the world.)
5,"Insightful, Courageous, Splendid Cinema!","Every now and again a movie comes along that illustrates a perspective that will embarass and annoy the establishment. This is such a movie.Clooney as always gives excellent value and its' great to see Matt Damon handle a more mature role so well. Even the cinematography shines.All the performances knit together beautifully and this film will become a classic in time.If you don't like politics, don't like to think too deeply or are very much a supporter of the political right or oil companies, you may not like - but you might enjoy or even appreciate the perspective."
2,I was not impressed by the story,"Although I like Clooney's and Damon's acting, this film left me with the impression that I lost two hours watching it without gaining anything valuable. The complex politics of the oil industries and the connections with corrupted Middle East governments is a common secret today as are the roots of islamic terrorism, but this movie simply could not produce something new and strong enough to catch the attention, with the exception of some very brutal scenes indeed."
2,What a mess,"This movie is so disjointed, so convuluted as to be nothing about something. Think of a New Orleans Jazz band with each instrument playing a totally different song at the same time and you have this movie in a nutshell. Too many strings left untied, too many subplots within subplots. I saw this movie because I generally like George Clooney movies but this isn't near one of his best. To quote a character from ""JFK', It's a riddle wrapped in an enigma. It's also not worth your time seeing it."
4,Great movie that demands repeat viewing,"Movies like this, that have multiple storylines that eventually coincide (though you may not pick up on it initially) can easily slip into the 'I lost interest in it' category...not this one. The storyline is topical and fascinating, the situations of the 3 main characters is believable and well executed. There is a quality about this movie that motivated me to keep watching, even though I wasn't sure where it would end up. Enough things sort of slipped by me , that a repeat watch will still be entertaining...something I very, very rarely care to do. Even if your opposed to the premise, or think it too fictitious or too much of a writers stretch at 'showing things how they really are', in terms of the US gov't's role in oil, etc there is no denying that this is quality movie-making."
5,Excellent,"Syriana - Superb Movie: Especially compared to most of what comes out of Hollywood. There is actually acting and actually a number of sub-plots which are not completely explained to the viewer. Yes, it is not like an episode of the Dukes of Hazzard, where Uncle Jessie narrates everything for you so you can go to the fridge for a beer and not get lost as the plot develops.I would give the movie high marks for being ambitious enough to try to paint a picture or montage of events, people, and stories related to a particular issue. I liken it to the movie Platoon.For those who are tempted to be overly critical, just remember, it is only a movie.Oh, and one more thing...it is somewhat unpredictable. I like that.CheersAshley Hockenberry"
4,Great film,"The is a great film, I'm just writing this blurb to raise this product's rating - so if you want a real review: look in the newspapers! sorry!"
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie but was disappointed. The various plots are extremely difficult to follow, though some became clearer after watching the 'deleted scenes' section of the DVD. This movie is ultimately pointless. I was hoping to gain some insight into the world of mideast oil and politics, but learned nothing. The scenes and thin story lines depicted only what is already common knowledge. Poorly made and worse-edited, it represents a missed opportunity because it could have been educational and fascinating."
1,A Waste of Time,"Normally I wouldn't take the time to write a review, but I hated this film so much I had to. It's long, it's boring, and it's hard to follow. I kept watching thinking that the film would ""pick up"" at some point, but before I knew it, the credits were rolling. I disliked this movie so much that I threw it in the garbage as soon as I took it out of my DVD player. I wish I had the 128 minutes of my life back that I wasted watching this. Don't waste your time."
1,Very Anti-American/ Pro Arab Movie,"This was a Very Anti-American/ Pro Arab Movie in my opinion..I hate that Matt Damon played in this movie, because I liked him. I expected it from George Clooney. Our Country isn't perfect, but we do more good than harm in the World. I hope all those that watch this Movie don't believe everything (or even half) of what this movie portrays. Movies like this try to kill American Pride.. F U Clooney and Damon.. Just my take on the Movie."
3,Sympathy for the Devil.,"Well, after seeing Syriana I feel compelled to turn in my Capitalist card first thing in the morning and run right out to join the Jihad. Apparently America IS the greatest exporter of evil in the history of evil. Isn't that what this movie wants me to believe?I'm joking, of course. Not funny, I know.The movie is pretty good, but the message isn't. Really, am I supposed to sympathize with a suicide bomber? Sorry, I don't think so. Meanwhile, Clooney drives his Mercedes through the Hollywood hills to his walled-off, million dollar home. Hypocracy has no shame."
1,Avoid,I never received this product and contact with the seller has been impossible . . . Avoid purchasing products from this seller.
1,A Convoluted Disconnected Hard-to-follow Mess of a Film,"Syriana was directed by Gaghan, the screenwriter for Traffic. Though not a fan of that film at least you had Soderbergh's direction and could follow the plot lines. Here we have so many vignettes that (in spite of the tagline) are disconnected, you quickly lose interest. There are no human characters to care about here. There are torture scenes, terrorism scenes, sophisticated sounding lawsuit dialogue you can't make head or tail of. George Clooney just finished a very good film, ""Goodnight and Good Luck"", and though this film gives him more onscreen time than others, it's still not enough to make us care about his character, a CIA pawn. Matt Damon you care about even less in his role as oil liaison whose wife is only there to fill out the background.Syriana utilizes a certain style of filmmaking, which some may like: shaky camerawork, convoluted dialogue, and fuzzy plotline. I prefer human drama where you care about the characters."
1,Syriana? SorryIsawit!,"I want a refund. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in years. For one thing, it has NOTHING to do with the book it claims to be based on. The book, ""See No Evil"", unabashedly blames many of our current intelligence woes on the Clinton administration. The movie tries to make the political statement that a bunch of yahoo Texas wildcatters are the puppeteers pulling the strings of the United States Government.Not only is it a bad, fictional re-write of a compelling real-life book, but it is terrible entertainment. There is absolutely no reason for Matt Damon's character, or his family to exist. His character doesn't have any affect on the outcome of anything that happens in the movie.Read the book....skip the movie."
2,"The details are wrong, the big picture is inexistant","The details are all fine if you don't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent. I won't bore you with the list.All the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake. Tell us something new.The overall storyline does not have much else going for it - I was expecting more intrigue, a more synthesized story line. A disappointment."
4,I wasnt expecting the tragic ending!!! Good movie tho.,"Bought this cause of George Clooney......didnt expect them to kill the main character!! Wow. intreque,spys,princely envy,got it all, even some ""brutality"" against George; then there was the bombing of the navy ship! His acting was great....wish had better ending tho.**** gave 4 stars"
2,Shoulda passed.,"RS Steube is accurate - and the movie was not for me. It wasn't ""bad"", but it wasn't ""good"" either. And more resembled a TV mini-series lumped together for a few hour movie. Barely 2 stars."
3,Ehhhh...What was the hype about??,"At its best, Syriana is an average film...Compared to Traffic this film feels shallow, rushed, and unimportant...What I had expected to be a in depth look at the many sides of the oil industry/conflicts was actually a very shallow look at it from too many angles to make you feel anything for the characters...Matt Damon's kid dies and all the heartbreak of such an event is boiled down to a 1 minute or less scene at the sons funeral where you see the characters from a distance...Oil industry people=bad people....Arab sheiks=bad people, in fact nearly the only people you are made to feel sorry for are the Pakastani workers who get fired from their jobs do to the merger of two oil companies...Yeah? So?? Happens here in the U.S. all the time but you don't see autoworkers going to blow up oil tankers because of it...All in all...not deserving of the praise it recieved and not to be looked back on in a kind light...."
3,Good movie...,"Too bad HD DVD is getting faded out :( Good thing I got this video for like $10!For the movie: It was a good movie, a little hard to follow but overall good."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I want my hour and a half back. This was the most boring movie I've seen in the last several years. I don't know how they got Damon and Clooney, and all the other top level stars to contribute to it. The money must have been real good.It sucked!"
3,good movie but you have to keep up,this is a good movie but i think it is unnecessarily complicated. if you blink you are going to miss something and then the whole movie does not make sense. this would have been a much better movie had the writers decided to make it easier to follow.expect to pay very close attention to this movie with no distractions or to watch it more than once.
3,One eyed is King among the Blind - Americans,"At least an approach of a Hollywood movie to show some of thebackgrounds of the middle east conflict. Maybe the first non-patriotic-hurrrrraaa movie of the propaganaministry of homeland-security. Sieg hail USA-nationalists may not like this movie,while I give it 3stars for trying to self critics american poli-tics in the middle east and all these banana-republics, wheresome evil dictator (Saddam,the Sauds, Mubarak, Somoza, Marcos,Pinochet etc)squeezes the bloody lemon for U.S and European bigbusiness profit. In fact USA is the succeeder of the colonial-states and goes on with the bloody business...sieg hail Israeltoo."
1,Tedious and Confusing,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. After watching it for over an hour, I had no idea what the heck was going on. It was so disjointed and the editing so awful that I had trouble following the characters and their motives. Compare this movie with Crash, which also had several apparently unrelated mini-stories within the story, but which was easy to follow and all made sense. I think George's political agenda got the better of him with this, but it at least garnered him an Academy Award."
1,"Disjointed, boring mess","This movie is listed as a thriller on Netflix, but there is nothing thrilling about it. It is very slow paced, particularly since it is only 126 minutes long-it felt much longer than that (like Lord of the Rings long). It is also hard to follow because it jumps all over the place and the cast seems to be in the hundreds. George Clooney plays the stereotypical amoral CIA agent who becomes disillusioned with his work. Matt Damon plays the fast talking energy trader with starry-eyed dreams of reforming the Middle East. Then there are the cartoonish Texas oil men, US politicians, CIA types, Arabs, and Chinese. This movie is just more conspiracy theory junk about how the American government and oil industry is bad and the Arabs are helpless, good people that are being exploited. I couldn't wait for it to end-not even worth renting."
1,Waste of time,"This movie is so bad, what a waste of time, it was such waste of time that I wont even waste my time writing a review."
2,Clooney BAD actor,"Clooney has NO RANGE as an actor!!!! I can't be the only one to see this?!?! He plays George Clooney in evey role, no change in voice or attitude! C'mon Hollywood, Just because they have a pretty face or because their folks were in the show bus means we have to suffer through a lifetime of bad acting! How bout people with talent!!! Oh, Yeah this movie stinks too!! Terrorists are misunderstood, and the US is evil, yeah right!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Overrated.,"This is the most hyped and overrated movie of the last several years. The filmmakers spend more time trying to justify how important and relevant this movie should be than actually telling a story. It tries to answer many questions, but the questions are never clear and in the end we don't really care what the point; if any, is supposed to be. The result; a two hour wreck that doesn't go anywhere.Difficult to believe that the people behind the excellent ""Traffic"" are responsible for this turkey. Clooney is not that good of an actor and actually he has been better in many other films. The fact that he won an Academy Award for this one is unbelievable.Summarizing, get ""Traffic"" instead. If you have already seen ""traffic"" watch it again."
1,"Boring, bad sound","Boring and bad sound. This is a largly conversational movie. I had to keep fiddling with the DVD remote to hear the whispering or low voice sequences then again to turn it down during the blaring music non-dialogue ""action"" scenes. Also I found the subtitles totally annoying. I'd preferred to listen to most of it instead while puttering around the house since there was not that much in this movie that really needed to be seen to be understood.It did, however, give a little bit of insight into Arab life, their rulers and the motivation of various factors and factions working against them. Might have worked far better as a documentary, though."
2,Confusing and hard to follow,"There's a lot of action and the acting is fine, but what in the world is going on in this film? The main point is made that oil causes corruption, greed, killing, and maiming, but figuring it all out was very frustrating for this viewer. Better to skip this one, despite the casting of fan favorites George Clooney and Matt Damon."
2,When Clooney is confused we are confused,"I strongly sense the confusion in this film is not deliberate, but rather due to poor editing and a jumbled script. There is way too much going on in this film and more is not necessarily better. About a half dozen storylines should have been stripped out of this film, since they become loose strings in the end. Really, only three storylines matter here and not one of them is the storyline that follows Clooney's character. Whatever statement this movie was trying to make is simply lost in all the clutter. If this jumble of storylines was deliberate, then it was a nice attempt but ultimately a failure. If it wasn't, well, find a better film editor."
2,A FEMALES POINT OF VIEW -SYRIANA,hard to follow .jumps from subject to subject..educated parents did not know CPR to try and save their small son..get real.chppy no continuity...I WASTED MY MONEY.
2,NEEDED A BETTER SCRIPT WRITER,"SYRIANA is a jumbled, confused mess as far as its plot is concerned. However, George Clooney is always watchable. Recommended for psuedo intellectual film buffs who like to sort out cryptic plots over a Starbucks and maybe for those seeking validation of any number of wacko conspiracy theories regarding oil companies and mid-east oil riches. Good production values and decent acting; just needed a better script writer. Ain't that always the case?"
1,"Boring moive, little action, waste of talented actors",I thought this movie might be good b/c I like most of Matt Damon's movies but I was greatly disappointed. I had a hard time even finishing the movie. Save your money or at least rent it before you even think about buying this one.
2,"Slow, convoluted and somewhat incoherent","I like a story different than the traditional cookie-cutter plots, so I can't give it just one star. But the movie was boring - you have to really pay attention and figure out what is going on, otherwise you just watch and very little seems to make coherent sense. That is, there are several plotlines running at once and you are trying to figure out how they are connected - by the time the movie is over you have an idea, but then it's too late to be involved with any of the characters because you haven't figured out to have sympathy for. Of course, all the big oil guys are bad guys, which is typical hollywood - governments = good, corporations = bad. Yet, if you think about it, evil corporations kill many fewer people than evil governments and are far easier to overthrow. I don't recommend this movie - I regret renting it."
2,Not for everyone,"If you like movies like Winter's Bone, No Country for Old Men and etc, this is probably for you. I hate movies that are too slow. While it has a pretty good script, the director forget that movies are meant to be enjoyed by viewers. You may like this movie but I don't."
4,An abosorbing story about man's greed for oil,"Interesting release from the writer of ""Traffic"", Stephen Gaghan, his first time out as a director. Much more complex than that film, ""Syriana"" boast a great cast with an Oscar winning performance from George Clooney. The film is terrific in Hi-Def (HD DVD or Blu-ray) and holds up very well on multiple viewings--recommended!!"
3,bloody oil,"So it ain't perfect and maybe it's kinda preachy, but it is a sincere attempt to look at a very serious problem and you get the impression they gave it their best shot. Trying to create an accurate depiction of the many realities and complexities of oil politics using the medium of film in which to do it is monumentous task, is it not? Basically SYRIANA's complicated plot is a take on the world's oil addiction the same way the film TRAFFIC deals with America's addiction to drugs. We see the situation multi-perspectively, all those involved shown and connections made between them. SYRIANA is successful I think in giving the sense it's a small, complicated, corrupt world filled with delusions, lies, and violence. Nobody is innocent, and for better or worse, we're all in it together."
3,good movie but hard time following it,"this was a good movie from what i got from it but i thought it was i a little hard to follow at times..but in closing this filmshows how far ""FAT CATS"" will go to make money.the only reason i have it 3 stars is because it is hard to follow.RATED R for LANGUAGE,and MILD VIOLENCE"
3,"Syriana, Irania, Iraquia, Libania","This is typical of the current trend in movies, partially started by Quentin Tarantino in Pulp Fiction, the scenes jump without rhyme or reason thus keeping you on edge, you lose track of who is the good guy and who to avoid, so you are almost forced to see the movie over again... then there is the language, it is partially incomprehensible, so again you can catch up a lot of the dialog when you see the movie again. One redeeming feature of such filmmaking is that you soon lose track of the story and seeing the movie over again is very cost effective, it's like seeing a new movie for free.Fianlly, this is a good movie if you are an American who owns shares in oil companies and if you sympathize with the US position in Iraq. I don't know how a Muslim would view this movie, it seems quite anti the culture in the Middle East.Bottom line, while somewhat disappointed I am glad I bought the DVD."
1,Syriana the 3rd review,Well I have been asked to review this 3 times now I think. So try this. It sucks. Syriana that is.Perhaps you will delete the reminders on my account now???
3,The feel bad movie of the year,"This movie is no fun at all. The acting is good and the story is interesting enough, but....... you will fall asleep.Just buy Munich."
1,Quit advertising this item',"Do us all a favor and take this movie off the market, it's not worth your money nor your time. The acting is stilted, and the plot, well I don't think I can really tell you much about this disjointed plot, but I agree it's about oil and it's another stab at everybodys kicking aid, the CIA. I went straight from watching this bomb to my son's room to tell him he had another movie he could sell."
1,Ugh!,"I just sat through this tonight and wished I could get my two hours back. Terrible script and a boring movie with unlikable characters. The movie blames all of the problems in the middle east on America, and oversimplifies everything in the process of doing so. I could have forgive it that if the script had been good or if it had been even mildly entertaining.Do yourself a favor and skip this. They must have paid the actors involved even more than usual to get them to participate in this film. Ugh!"
1,Propogandistic fiction from Hollywood,"This movie got 1 star from me after watching the sanctimonious interviews in the featurettes. The viewer is urged to become politically involved about events that are entirely fictional. Oil companies killing world leaders to get contracts away from the Chinese? That is Hollywood leftist baloney, not political education.This movie is to middle east politics as _The Day After Tomorrow_ is to global climate. Propogandistic fiction."
1,ok if your ready 4 bed,"This movie is a good history lesson if you can stay awake, and like movies that jump from present to past to present, to... well you get the picture. I was in the military and was a history major in college. We were going to purchase this film, but decided to rent it instead... good thing we rented 1st."
4,Diary of King Phillips War,"This tome is a first person report by someone who was there and did it. Col. Benj Church was both a colonist and arespected soul by both whites and natives alike. He was deeply respected in that he kept his word to the natives but held to the position of the incursive white settlers. Church in his dotage retells his story through this diary written and later published by his son. It is noteworthy for its historical accuracy as it is chilling in the retelling of combat with the forces of King Phillip (Metacom). This was a bloody war and costly in lives lost making it, in some estimations, the costliest war on America's shores. Good reading for the average person. Informative reading to the local historian who might know the shores and trails of Southeast Massachusetts and Rhode Island."
1,not what i would reccommend,"not very interesting at all. predictable and boring, little susupense. attention getting nonsense"
5,Reading On to Plan B should be everybody's Plan A,"This book is fantastic. A ""cant put it down classic"" A must buy, a must read. Ted Powell is this country's, I mean, this world's, next icon"
5,Take The Lead - Is A Must See,"I rented it and that night bought it on amazon. I also purchased the music. I have several nieces and nephews and made sure they saw it too. It's great for giving the young support on being labeled ""different"". Kind of a 2006 'To Sir With Love"""
3,Note To People On The Movie And Music,"What the movie is about, which nobody has been inclined to mention at this point, is the true story about how ballroom and other dance programs first came into the public school system. I know hollywood, as usual, takes some artistic license, but the important part is the essence of the story. I am a person who is personally involved in theater and dance, both jazz and ballroom currently, and I think that you shouldn't dismiss this cd just because it doesnt have the ballroom tracks on it. Besides, for the $18-$20 normal price of cds, you can have this one and Take The Lead: Get Up And Dance, which does have the ballroom tracks, and that one does include the Hip Hop/Tango mix. If you really want to learn ballroom dance, you need to take classes though. Alot of fun and you actually have a use for the music then. Hope this helps some."
3,great soundtrack,"movie was same as all the past 'dance' movies, underdogs learn to dance and win comp. What I want to know is during the closing credits they played a song, sounded a bit like james blunt, but doesn't seem to be on the soundtrack, can anyone tell me what the name of the song was?"
2,Boo.... hiss!,"This is good hip-hop music, but that's ALL it is. The infectious tango track from the movie, (which was even used again for the title page on DVD), is conspicuously NOT there, nor any waltz, rumba or other ballroom music tracks that were in the movie. I THOUGHT THIS WAS A MOVIE ABOUT URBAN SCHOOL KIDS WHO LEARN BALLROOM DANCING! Sure, the hip-hop tracks should be there too because that was an integral part of the film, but that was only about half the music in the film. And in this case, the absence of ballroom dancing tracks, for a movie specifically about ballroom dancing is unforgivable. There should be a disclaimer on the cover of this CD to warn away anyone looking for the great, danceable tango, waltz, etc. tracks that were in the film."
2,Very disappointed,"Watched the movie on DVD, loved it so much I immediately got on-line and bought the soundtrack. One of the things I liked about the movie is the juxtaposition of ballroom music and hiphop. The soundtrack for this movie about ballroom dancing does not have a single track of the ballroom music on it! What's up with that?!"
1,Bypass527,If any one wants to know who sings the waltz song at the end it is Nat King Cole singing Fascination
1,"The DVD's 5 stars, but the CD's a dud","Whoa, what a disappointment!!! I checked out the CD music and wondered 'HEY, were we even watching the same movie'?? If all you put on the soundtrack is the hip-hop, it completely misrepresents the film -- which is about ghetto kids learning ballroom, tango and swing, y'all. I was waiting for the swing piece from the dance-school scene and that dynamite, blow-you-away tango that the teacher uses to to lure the kids into learning ballroom ... but those are nowhere to be heard. BAD IDEA! If I wanted straight hip-hop, I wouldn't have been looking for this soundtrack: I'd go straight to the source. As it is, I was looking for the **other** music used for the film. And it's not there. For that reason alone, if I could give this NO stars, I would. The producers need to get a clue here. 'Nuff said."
1,Take the Lead CD (Music),"My husband and I were very, very disappointed with this CD. It did not follow the movie at all. It left out so many songs, 1 for instance, one of the best, the Tango scene at the beginning and many more songs. We wer very disappointed. It should have gone directly with the movie.....just like the CD for ""Meet Joe Black"". I felt funny in returning it, since I have already opened it, and listened to it several times just to make sure. But very disappointed.MAKE IT EXACTLY LIKE THE MOVIE.Thank you."
1,This is available from Warner Home Video for half the cost!,"This is really a four star movie, but it is being sold at twice the retail price. You can purchase this from Warner Home Video for $19.95. Don't be fooled by this seller!"
3,Medal of Honor,"Inspiring Movie. They should have made another movie in 1945 for Medal of Honor recipient ""John Bassilone"" who is portrayed in the HBO series ""The Pacific"". Both Marines real American hero's."
3,Not the same product!,"I was kind of disappointed when I ordered this as I was expecting to get the same ""Treat Elite Keratin Leave-In Treatment"" that I was used to, especially since the picture was the same one that I was used to getting, however the product has clearly changed as the packaging and the name is different. The package now only states Treat Elite, not Treat Elite ""Keratin"" Spray, no where on the bottle does it state that this product contains ""Keratin"" any longer. Although it did leave my hair feeling good, I will probably no longer buy this product anymore as I was wanting a ""Keratin"" leave-in conditioner, not just a regular leave-in conditioner. If you are looking for a Keratin Spray this is no longer it."
1,Piece O' [junk],"Granted, there were a couple of things I liked about this MP3 CD player, I did like the headphones and the display and the menues. However, considering it ceased functioning less than TWO days after I purchased it, I would not recommend it to anyone! The evening that I bought the RCA RP2410 it worked just fine. The next day, however, it kept freezing in the middle of a song, and yes, like so many others, I had to keep removing the batteries every five minutes to reset it. Then, I dropped it. Yes, I know that that is not the best thing for a CD player, but it wasn't very far, or hard, and it happended while I was trying to reinsert the batteries! Well, after that, it just kept telling me that the lid was open and stopped functioning all together. I returned it the next day and payed to upgrade to a Rio SP100 which is a far superior MP3-CD player (although not without a few glitches). So, please do not waste your time or money on the RCA RP2410!"
1,RCA RP2410 Personal CD Player With MP3 Playback,"...My biggest two gripes are that it makes a high pitch noise continuously and occassionally snaps. This happened while I listened to many regular store bought audio cd's also. Most of the problem was solved by turning off the ESP, but that didn't help in MP3 playback, only in CD. Even with the ESP off the CD playback had crackling noise which I don't understand at all. Someone at RCA needs to be fired for this, bad quality, but cool grey design. I think I might return the insides and frame the shell. Piece of!"
4,Excellent at this price,"I have not had the trouble with skipping that some reviewers claim to have experienced. EXCEPT when I tried encoding below the 64Kbps level mentioned in the specs. It is a nice, metal and plastic unit and I have been happy with it except for one problem. The unit takes four (4) AA batteries and requires an 8volt DC adapter. It comes with an AC/DC adapter, but there is really no car kit that would be suitable because of the voltage requirements of this unit.The 8 levels of folders are really nice. I use Windows XP and simply drag-n-drop whole folders and subfolders onto the CD-R, burn the CD, and have hours of MP3s available already arranged into playlists from the computer. I'm not a techie, so I love the ease of use and the large LCD display. The unit tells me what it is doing (even when it is only reading the folder structure of the CD), what it is playing, etc.Not the best possible unit available, but for the street price it is quite good."
3,A hint,"We'll it's not perfect, but I have found that when the unit can't track (or skips) MP3 correctly, if I remove the batteries for about 30-60 seconds, and try again, I ususally can get all the tracks on the CD to play well. Some sort of hard reboot.Sometimes I have to so the same on the next CD. Go figure !At least there's a work around."
1,I Will Never Sell One Again,"While it appears to be well made, and the interface is wonderful, MP3 playback is horrible. It skips, it pops, it jumps-all without external jostling, despite the claims of high skip protection. At one point I observed it listing a different song than the one playing! After a period of 'warm-up' much of this difficulty disappeared, however, these problems, coupled with the unusual power requirements (4 AA batteries or an 8-volt power adapter-this is a difficulty because car power adapters do NOT come in 8-volt, rather they jump from 7.5 to 9, following the standard 1.5v battery progression), make this a horrid purchase. Of course, the age of this model may be a factor. I hope RCA makes a new one and learns from this mistake of a model."
1,Don't waste your time and money!,"I bought this brand new, factory sealed, and I couldn't even get it to play a regular CD bought in the store without skipping like crazy! Trying to play a CD-R was even worse. It would either skip or just lock up. Another piece of junk made in China. The volume settings are not gradual. It's either off or too loud. Since I couldn't even play a regular store bought CD without it skipping constantly, I didn't waste any more time by burning MP3's. I immediately returned this player and put the money towards the Rio SP250 which is completely awesome! You have to pay a lot more for it though. Since the Rio is also made in China, I bought the extended two-year warranty. I just wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased the RCA. Don't make the same mistake I did! Listen to the reviews. Don't waste your time and money on the RCA!"
1,Dont Buy This!,I've tried everything I know and still the same problems mentioned.It still skips several minutes aheadfor no reason when you least expect it. Wont play 32 kbps MP3s ..maybe 64 kbps sometimes. Old Time Radio or Audio Book fans look elsewhere.This aint the player for you. Makes awful sounds whenever it feels like it.Im returning mine tomorrow and trying a RioVolt. Dont even bother to waste your time on this player.
1,RCA - Not ready for MP3 playback prime time!!,"I am on my second unit having returned the first - this one is no better. Problem is with MP-3 playback on burned CD-R's - using two different burners. Awful noises (screeches & squeals) at random intervals (will play file fine - then have problem on later play). This with 650MB CD-R's (different brands), all at 128 bitrate, all at 192 bitrate also. Unit locks up randomly to the point I have to remove & replace batteries to get it back.This unit is junk for mp3's. Plays music cd's great."
2,"Plays MP3s Well, Has trouble with CDA",I purchased one of these a few weeks ago. It plays MP3s very well and is pretty easy to use. The problem that I have with mine is that it seems to chop off the last second of regular CDA CDs. I took it back to the store to exchange for a new one and found that both the store's demo unit and the replacement one did the same thing.
1,Doesn't Work,After burning a disc full of mp3s I had no luck trying to play music on the RCA RP2410. Several more attempts with different CD R Discs and still no luck. It did play regular CD's just fine. I don't think they've worked the kinks out of this product yes. My opinion is to look elsewhere for a portable MP3 solution.
1,Doesn't work,"Received the player, and can't get it to work. Shows picture in the screen that is not shown in the instruction book. Contacted RCA customer support - takes up to 3 days for a response!"
1,Not a good buy!,"This player works extremely well when plugged in and sitting on a stable surface. When you attempt to use it as an actual ""walk""man it completely malfunctions. It skips continuously, freezes, won't turn off, and [drains] batteries dry in a matter of hours."
1,Totally Unreliable,Skipps arbitrarily. All my tracks were recorded at 2x and at 128 Kbps as recomended. Sometimes it would play them and sometimes it would not. It seemed to work better when warm and with CD-R verses CD-RW. I listen to music to relax and this actually stressed me out. I took it back after a week and exchanged it for another thinking maybe the one I had was defective but this one I think is actually worse. I am taking it back today and getting my money back. My advice is spend the extra money and a get a better one.
1,Too many glitches,"The ideal MP3-CD player would have the performance of the Rio SP90/100/250 and the display of the RCA RP2415. I bought this because I was impressed with the screen and figured that the decoder can't be all that different from the Rio. However, all the CDs which played fine on my Rio SP100 and Memorex 8507 popped, skipped and squealed. Needless to say, I returned the unit. Now it is available with car kit included, but I wouldn't buy it until they fix all the problems. If other players are able to play the files, there must be something wrong with the player, not the files."
3,There's always an exception...,"I know the science says that melatonin is a brain chemical that initiates sleep. Theanine is a brain chemical that inhibits excessive brain chatter from other neuro-chemicals. But, these double whammy's don't work for everyone; namely me. Darn it!"
1,It's not PLUS it's ULTRA,They changed the formulation and now it keeps me awake and makes my heart race. I wish they would bring back the PLUS!
4,Sons love these,I bought these for my three boys and they love them. They love Thomas and love the View Master - looks like binoculars to them so it is a bonus!
5,Great Funk and Awesome Guitar!...,"This album/CD is a classic in the true sense of the word, 'of the first or highest quality'. The funk jams funk out, the slow jams groove and when Ernie Isley jams, he can play guitar with the best of them!'Pride' and 'Livin' In The Life' have a great funk groove/rhythm. 'Footsteps In The Dark' is nice, slow jam.My favorites are 'Climbin' Up The Ladder', 'Voyage To Atlantis' and 'Go For Your Guns'.""Climbin...' starts with a nice heavy rhythm/beat, then in the middle Ernie rips a jammin' solo, comes back to the main rhythm and to finish it off, Ernie goes to town and rips through two additional solos. ""Voyage...' is a beautiful slow jam with a beautiful set of guitar solos throughout the song. Last but not least is 'Go For Your Guns' and Ernie does. It starts right after 'Livin' In The Life' and follows the rhythm for about 30 seconds and then Ernie goes off!I cannot recommend this enough! Pick it up and you will be very glad you did..."
5,So far ahead of it's time,"This album is a great example of the great music made in the 70's that never made it to the radio. The Isley brothers have always been makers of great music. They have always been colorblind in making their music, it wasn't disco, it wasn't even funk in the way that many people think of the genre'. This album like the rest of the work they did in the late seventies was a rocked up funk, suitable for clubs, parties and dances, that is if you could find a club, dance, or party that didn't play the tripe that was on the radio at the time. I love this album! Livin in the Life was my mantra during those years and I remind myself of it from time to time rattling the windows of my car. Too bad that this innovative work didn't have the influence that it should have at the time, music today would have been enormously better off."
1,I threw up in my mouth.,"Umm... I'm speechless pretty much. Well not quite. The fact that a retarded ringtone can make number one is bad. It is bad judment on everyone's part that buys this filth and abomination to the music industry. I used to think they had it goin' good in the music department over in the UK, but now, like most things I trusted in these dark times, that too has taken a critical blow. First it was Star Wars and now it's the UK's taste in music. And for this I weep.And of course vomit."
2,Kids eating mat,"I don't usually write reviews, but I feel that this I could have made this placemat myself, so the quality wasn't that great. I mean it's hard plastic, not something softer and better quality that I would expect for a placemat. Next time, I would probably only pay $3.00 for this placemat-not $5.00."
5,Like ALL Incra rules... this one is PERFECT!,"If you haven't yet used an Incra Rule of one sort or the other, you are missing out on exceptional precision and well thought-out manufacturing. The Bend Rule is one of many different Incra Rules that meet specific requirements. This one is for precise measuring and marking along a 90-degree edge. Also available in 6-inch and 18-inch (both of which I own).Quality is very high, and though on first look, the rules seem a little flexible, that is by design. The premium paid in the pricing of these rules is a little steep, but in my opinion, well worth it in spades.An Incra 5mm mechanical pencil is included with each rule, and more of these precision marking pencils are available both on Amazon and elsewhere.STRONG Recommendation!"
1,Just like Warren's other books.,"I didn't buy this book, although I had the misfortune of buying Warren's first book as I was beginning to play online Hold'em. I have read through this newer book at the nearby bookstore, and I leaf through it whenever I need a laugh.It has been stated by previous reviewers that this book was created in order to poison new players' minds and make bad players out of them. That makes sense to me. If you were going to write your own book on poker, would you want to tell the truth? Heck, I'd load as many misleading statements and half-truths into that book as I could! I'd make money on the book AND make more money off my misinformed opponents at the poker table.If this was Warren's intention when writing this book, then hats off to him. Well done. But if he really believes this garbage, then I sure hope he can survive off his book royalties, because he sure ain't making it at the poker table."
1,Another Warren Anti-Fan,"Ken Warren's ""Winner's Guide"" was my first poker book, and like a lot of others here, I had to unlearn a lot. But more than that, I was just horribly confused. I thought it was because I was new to the game that I didn't understand the strategies he lays forth. Now I know it's because those strategies don't make sense.Even before I knew so many people disliked his books, I chose to disregard almost all of his advice because of his comments that border on bigotry. According to him, people with tattoos are terrible players, as are attractive women (tell that to Jennifer Harmon, heh heh). If he makes such obvious bad recommendations, I really can't trust that any of his advice is solid.I don't think Ken Warren is a great author for poker. I've read a lot of excerpts from THIS book that I just don't agree with. And the nail in the coffin is that a book about TEXAS HOLD'EM actually has a five-card hand on the cover."
1,Worst Poker Book Ever!,"My sister bought this book for me at a clearance place for $1. Sadly, it is not worth even that. His advice on people to play poker with? ""Beautiful women - as they haven't taken the time or effort to learn the game"". Who else? ""Players with tattoos, as he says if they are dumb enough for a tattoo, they can't play poker"". Wow, I was stunned at the rest of his advice on being a winning player. I do not have a clue how this was published; please do yourself a favor and seek out the much better poker books out there."
1,utter crap,"ken warren is self-contradictary in many places in his books and a pretty bad teacher in general. your money will be better spent with books by david skanksy, lee jones, bob ciaffone, and others."
1,"This author is pretentious, and the book is garbage","This was by far the worst book on Texas Hold'em ever written. I think it's actually a conspiracy to poison our minds and make us worse.Probably my favorite thing to laugh at in this book are his absolutely ridiculous conclusions about interpreting the texture of flops, and betting patterns of others.This scat-book does have one good use though. And that would be recommending it to the idiots who come play at your home games. It's like poker kryptonite. They WILL get worse. The only problem is they'll buy it, and Warren will profit further from his literary vomit.So maybe they can rent it from the library or something. Then it's really a win-win situation."
2,"Sorry Ken, but the book sucks","Now that online poker literally pays all my bills, I can come back to this book with a much deeper understanding of the game (and this book). Let me start off: there are much better limit hold 'em books for the beginner. The advice is weak-tight and the starting preflop hands are far from optimal (I think he recommends limping J9s in middle position and other -EV advice). Also, there is a lot of useless information for the beginner - specifically statistics. A beginner shouldn't be worrying about how many combinations of hands there are or how often we get dealt a pocket pair.. NO. they should be worried about the reasoning behind the preflop raise or why not to call a preflop raise with KJo from a tight player in early position."
2,Be warned.,"I've just started playing Hold 'Em in big casual games. I can play competently but have no knowledge of advanced strategies and odds and everything that makes you an actual good player. So after a quick persual of the selection of books I bought this one. Within 10 minutes of reading it at home I knew I had made a mistake. The first red flag was when I was reading the author's introduction...this man has no championship credentials whatsoever. The most impressive claim they can come up with is ""He has been asked to not play in tournaments to give other players a chance to win"". Uhh...great.Second, the book claims to be the most comprehensive Hold 'Em book ever written, but it pays pretty much no attention to the complete begginner.Third, and most seriously, No Limit Hold 'Em is not addressed at all. This should have been much more clearly communicated on the cover.I can't speak to the validity or usefulness of the concepts in this book, just know what you are buying."
3,Scary for my glass top stove,Needed this item so I could go from stovetop to oven. Glad I read the insert BEFORE using it and told my husband (who cooks a lot) about it. It warns you not to slide the hot pot from the burner to a cold burner on a glass topped stove. This could cause the pot to permanently damage the stove. I wouldn't have purchased had I known this but didn't want to pay to ship it back. So be VERY careful when using on glass top stoves!!!!
2,"My first dutch oven - works well, but has chipped; wrong picture in product description!","I bought this on 2/17/2007 for $20 and it actually has a domed stainless steel lid and right-angled metal handles, not the glass lid or angled handles as shown in the current picture. So far, I've used it to roast pork and chicken and both times, the dishes turned out well. I've not used it very often since I bought it, but now it has a 2mm round chip on the inside near a handle - you can actually see the inner layer. I don't know how that happened as I take good care of my pots and pans, and have only used wooden or nylon utensils in it, and handwashed it. I've boiled water in it (Cincinnati has bad-tasting water and boiling and filtering seems to work) as far as I can remember, I've only used it in the oven twice, and to cook something soupy on the gas stove top maybe 3 times. The chip has started to rust, so it'll probably go in the trash real soon."
5,I use it for everthing....,"This non-stick pot is big enough for stews, chili, soups, and much more. I love it so much I am buying another as a gift."
3,Nice but all three handles get too hot...,"This was the first pot I bought with bare metal handles. Since I was going to use this pot for only making rice on low heat, I thought I would be safe. Big mistake. I ended up burning both hands when I tried to move the pot away from the burner after 13 minutes on low heat. What was curious was that the handle on the glass lid got too hot to handle too. I wonder if this is a design flow because I've owned skillets with all-metal handles and used them to saute veggies on high heat. Never ever had a heat conduction issue with those pans..."
5,Just what I needed!,"This Circulon 5.5 quart Dutch oven is just the addition I needed to my cookware collection. I wanted a pot that was big enough for a fairly large stew or soup but not so big as my pasta pot! Perfect size, great price."
5,Excellent Cookware!,"Circulon cookware is excellent. It heats quickly and evenly, cleans up easily, and seems to last forever. The key is not to overheat it (never over medium high) and to always hand wash. I cook a lot and am currently writing a cookbook, so I know what I like and what works for me. Circulon works great! This pot is also a wonderful size - not to large, not too small- a great starter piece if you want to try Circulon without making a big investment."
3,Dimension on the description is incorrect,"The Product Dimensions say 11 x 6 x 11.8 inches. But it is 9 3/4"" in diameter and 4"" in height. So I was disappointed when it came smaller than 11""."
1,Not Infinite Circulon,"I bought this pot to use with a new induction stove, but it will not work as it is NOT Infinite Circulon. The regular Circulon ware is not magnetic."
1,This Dutch Oven Really Stinks,"I've had my share of dutch ovens in my time, and I have to say that this is the foulest one yet. I thought I smelled a good deal when I got it, but boy was I mistaken."
2,"Circulon's outer surface whitens with dish soap, dishwasher or not.","I bought these pans to hang on a rack in the kitchen. They were great looking when I bought, but after a few washings the outer coating comes off and becomes an unsightly ash appearance. The pans are buried in a cabnet...not hanging."
3,This is a product given free with the set,I was not happy to see a sticker on the box saying that this was a free gift from the company when you bought a set. Who knows if this is the same quality as the actual product or the set.
4,GOOD TO MAKE EDIBLE STUFF,"The vendor is very receptive to my queries.This is my first time experience with this company, I think I can trust them with my future orders,Provided they maintain the same level of pricing and service........GOOD DAY"
3,Lighter weight than expected,"I had a Circulon pot of this size for many years and was seeking to replace it. However I was a little disappointed that this one was rather lighter than my old pot. I think that the earlier pot was ""commercial"" grade Circulon and I assumed this one would be too. I think if this pot is a cheaper grade the description should specify that it is lightweight and NOT commercial grade."
5,A Perfect Pot for Oven or Range,"This pot is great for cooking pasta, stew, popcorn, soup, or anything which requires sautéeing, braising, or boiling. The buffet handles are oven-proof, and the elegant lid makes it a lovely addition to a buffet. I'm planning on acquiring a second one of these."
4,Developing the Comedic Genre in Restoration England,"Dryden's ""Marriage A-La-Mode"" can be thought of as a Comedy of Manners play of the Restoration era but was actually written before the genre took true form and had a part in developing its eventual popularity. ""Marriage A-La-Mode"" satirizes the English Aristocracy and has the distinction of creating what became comedic typologies, especially in the character of Melantha. The separate storylines are only superficially interwoven though both are explicitly critical of aristocratic lifestyles and attitudes. If you like the genre of Restoration Comedy, Dryden's ""Marriage"" is a good bet and without the over-complicated plots of Sheridan."
3,Too much talk - no flexibility,"The idea is a nice one -- pictures of places in Venice as they are today, coupled with their representations on the famous Barbari map. But the catch -- and it is a big one -- is that you have to view each pair accompanied by the somewhat self-satisfied narrator. He schoolmarms a history of each place at very great length before we see the pairing, and you have to go thru the process every time you wish to look, or look again, at any of the many places available. Not at all for reference or browsing: one would not want to go thru all that more than once.And when you wish to exit the program, there is an interminably long list of credits before it closes."
4,Brings back alot of good memories,Of the songs on the CD Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel was the best. To dance or roller-skate to it was a blast.
2,"Heaven, this is too fast...","I'm only rating this on the song ""Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel,"" which I purchased to create an anniversary compilcation CD. I don't know the original source of this version, but it is at a much faster tempo than the longer version on ""Anthology"". To my memory, the ""Anthology"" version is what I heard in the discos of the 70's. I decided I wanted the ""Anthology"" version for my collection. Be sure to listen to both samples before makeing your purchasing decision."
5,Great Retrospective,"I was first introduced to Prince at his retrospective held at the Guggenheim (which this book is based on). It was an amazing exhibit and for those of you who missed it, this book captures it quite nicely. The introduction is extremely well written and I highly recommend you read it if you want to get a better understanding of the artist. The materials of the book are top notch and present nearly all of Prince's work. The end of the book also has some great essay's inspired by Prince and the concepts he invokes but not necessarily about him. Some very interesting people contribute including the cartoon editor for The New Yorker and an editor at Hustler."
3,"Cool guy, interesting work.",The book is pretty decent but pricey. Multiple languages are a pain in the neck.
3,"3.5 stars, rounded to 3 for Amazon. This book did not have any surprise or delight factor, but it was a nice read.","I found it easy to put down to do other things, but that doesn't make it bad. There were good characters, good plot, typical regency romance novel. It was about a soldier with post traumatic stress syndrome. The heroine soothed his stress. Of course they didn't call it PTSS back then. There was a bad guy after the heroine.Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: four. Setting: 1814 London. Copyright: 2002. Genre: regency romance.To date there are seven books in the Knight family series, of which I have read six, as follows. My review for His Wicked Kiss was posted to Amazon on 2/6/07. All the rest are posted on 5/26/08.The Duke (4.5 stars)Lord of Fire (2 stars)Lord of Ice (3.5 stars)Lady of Desire (4.5 stars)Devil Takes a Bride (2 stars)His Wicked Kiss (3 stars)"
3,3 & 1/2 stars is more accurate,"In some ways I liked this one better than Lord of Fire; in other ways I liked LoF better. Foley has improved some in her errors & use of modern language in a period setting. There is still some of that, but much less. However, she makes other historical mistakes that pull the reader out of the story. ""Silent Night"" has already been mentioned. In addition, the phrase ""mad as a March hare,"" while popular in the 1800s predates this story a bit.Damien is not as complex as Lucien (LoF) but Miranda is a livelier heroine than Alice. The difficulty with this book is its uneven character; some parts were excellent while others were slow or less than engaging. The ending, especially Napoleon's return & Waterloo, felt rushed. Damien's war career is so central to this book that such a significant event deserved more attention.So, some good stuff, but flawed."
3,It was good...,"Not bad, not excellent either. It had its moments. I guess there were just some parts that seemed unrealistic to me. Like the un-natural way Damian and Miranda would caress each other in the beginning of the book after only knowing each other a few days. Their initial meeting though is very electric, you'll enjoy reading it. It's a fun read and a page turner, it has a lot of action too."
2,too shallow and boring,"okay, what the hell is wrong with galen foley's latest works...lord of fire and ice were terrible in comparison to the duke and earlier works. the characters just didn't incite any sort of emotion for me and the plot was a bit thin. i really didn't get a feel for the main character's ""mental problems"" and the there were toooo few interactions b/w the heroine and the main character. i could of lived without some interactions, but the book also lacked passion, i.e. the book did NOT go up in flames. I sat there thinking ""geeze...these two characters just need to do it...!""i was bored by the third chapter, skipping thru the rest of the book and at the end, some stupid plot about the scaping Napoleon pops out, like I care about Napoleon, and the stories focuse on that and you loose sight of the two main characters. disappointing..."
5,More than 5 stars!,"READ THIS BOOK - but first read Lord of Fire. These twin stories are wonderfully romantic, exciting, and down right sexy!MC in woodstock"
5,I'd rate this 10 stars if I could...,"I loved this book. Damien was everything I love in a romance hero: strong, sexy, and kind-hearted. Miranda was spunky and fun. It did not surprise me at all that Ms. Foley wrote Miranda as a strong willed woman who falls head over heels in love, submitting to him as another reviewer wrote. She was seeking adoration from the beginning of the novel and she found it with Damien.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick read that entertains as well as touches the heart. Bravo, Ms. Foley!"
3,Nice Quality Towels,"The towels were of good quality, but the color was not even close to what was pictured. They are much lighter."
2,description misleading and inaccurate,"the product description on Amazon reads as follows:Comes with Regular Plexi Glass1.25"" Satin Black FrameSingle white Acid Free mathooks and wire for wall mountingmat openings 3"" high by 2-3"" wideMy reason to purchase was based primarily on the first and third items, both of which are inaccurate. The frame itself is of high quality, but it arrived with window glass, not plexi glass, and a normal thin paper die cut mat with non acid free backing. Window glass presents a hazard to prints if broken, and it gives a green cast to the images. Be aware of this when ordering and allow for the necessity to replace these parts."
3,A rare politically-savvy drama,"I think some people have been so rapturous at seeing a smart, politically savvy drama like this one that they've stumbled a little too eagerly to sing its praises. I liked ""Deterrence"" very much, but I must admit that it has some pretty significant flaws at its core. To its credit, its knowledge of politics far transcends that of any Hollywood movie in recent or distant memory (except for ""The Contender"", which is not coincidentaly written and directed by Rod Lurie, who performed the same duties for ""Deterrence), and the film is unfailingly gripping. At the same time, some of its revelations are simply unbelievable to a viewer who has the political knowledge to understand the finer details of the film. For instance, the final ""twist"" (which I will not reveal here) goes beyond implausible. It simply would and could not happen. But the movie is still a good one."
4,Powerful Piece,"Rod Lurie's ""Deterrence"" is an extremely overwhelming film in which Kevin Pollak stars as the US President faced with the possibility of having to detonate Baghdad after an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait."
1,Did we watch the same movie as the other reviewers?,"This is one of the worst movies we have seen in a long time. A totally improbable and unbelievable plot, laughable acting, and a budget that compares with the Blair Witch project. Save yourselves, run for cover!"
2,Saddam Hoosanes son actually makes war while,"president gets stuck in a diner during a snow storm while on his campaign. So the towel boy gets the ultimatum: stop or suffer nuclear detonation over Bagdad. This story sucks, filled with rightous presidential verbal poo."
2,this movie stunk,Saddam Hoosane's son makes war and advances on Kuwait no less while the president gets stuck in a diner during a bad snowstorm.
4,Deterence,"An underground gem! No big stars, no big budget special effects. This movie is a must see because of the performances and the script. A movie for film lovers who appreciate a well told story more than a $50,000,000 c.g.i. creation. Kevin Pollak's defining moment as an actor. Easily as good as The Usual Suspects without the ensamble cast."
4,Great Political Movie,"I saw this movie years ago, before our involvement in our current sturggles in Afganistan and Iraq. The movie is good, but the ending makes it great - I love when movies do that! After watching again, was interesting to see how Iraq and our current struggles relate. If you like to keep up on politics, this is a good movie to watch."
4,"It's ""Deterrence,"" stupid!","""DETERRENCE is the art of producing in the mind of an opponent the fear to attack"" (loosely paraphrased from ""Dr. Strangelove""). If you don't get that then you are missing the whole point of this insightful exposition on the nature of strategic perception (or misperception). Put simply: bluffing only works if your enemy thinks you are NOT bluffing. And the only way to prove that you aren't bluffing is to establish a reputation for following through on your threats. If you do that consistently, then you will have created the necessary perceptual basis for effective deterrence, and you won't need to actually do more than threaten, because people will take you at your word. ""He who would have peace, let him prepare for war.""Anyone having a passing familiarity with the history of the UN, U.S. foreign policy between 1993 and 2001, or family dynamics at the local Wal-Mart should have a sufficient reference context for appreciating this dynamic."
4,A Great Movie,"I teach Political Science at Albion College. I thought that this film was great - unfortunately, it was overshadowed by others films at release, and hasn't recived the attention it deserves. I recommend it highly!"
4,The tools of tomorrow,"This book illustrated to me what needs to be done to be a leader in the new economy.Management really needs to read this book and implement some of its philosophies. People in most companies are not always satisfied with what they do and old techniques simply don't always work anymore. Organization managers need to accept this fact and commit themselves in making a change. After reading this book, I can clearly see that the company that I work for has a long way to getting where it needs to go and time is of essence."
4,Almost Perfect,"The first six tracks are perfect, but when you hit the seventh track, things aren't bad - but could be better. My favorite tracks are 'Strange Frontier,' 'Beautiful Dreams,' 'Killing Time,' and the two covers of Springsteen and Dylan tunes. This album is not perfect, but it beats most of what's out there today."
3,three and one-half stars,"i picked this vinyl up at its release and played it very little. It didn't seem to move me too much. Recently while transferring my Vinyl to digital I got the chance to hear it again ""for the first time"". It's really a fine effort. Taylor leans heavily on synth and programming but never fails to let the silicon chips block out the soul. We even get to hear a bit of Brian May guitar. Lush in its production Taylor layers his sound so well it still sounds pretty fresh today amid all the synth drums, sound swells and blips and bleeps from the synths. All is not perfect however, some melodies fall flat (""beautiful dreams"") and Springsteen's ""Racing in the Streets"" lays flacid, but alas this is not a top choice Springsteen song to cover. High spots are...""Man on Fire"" ""I cry for You"" ""Masters of War"" and the hauntingly beautiful ""Killing Time"". Taylor was indeed ahead of his time. At least he was on my timepiece."
4,"Perhaps Taylor's best solo album, but. . .","While this was perhaps Taylor's best solo album, considering the combo of polish and catchy cuts, his work with The Cross was far superior. Unfortunately, the three albums he made with that group are no longer in print (""Shove It"", ""Mad, Bad & Dangerous to Know"", and ""Blue Rock""). And although it was rough hewn, I enjoyed ""Fun in Space"" far more overall."
4,More than just Springsteen influence,"I agree with all the reviewers, and I too came to this album late, though I've always been a Queen fan. But, after all the Springsteen influences, I discerned a strong Bowie and Eno influence, and even on one tune, a Lou Reed influence. This was the mid-80s, after all. A nice album, much better than much of the dreck today."
2,Only for the obscure.,"I bought this for my friend who is 37. I thought it would be fun for her to relive her youth a bit. I was expecting the encyclopedia to have information, whimsical details, pictures, etc. on typical 80's pop culture. First of all, the writing style leaves a lot to be desired. If I wanted to be bored, I would read my DSM. The bigger problem, is that the content is about obscure 80's bands and performers that no child of the eighties has heard of. I would say less than ten percent of the information is relevant or interesting. This is not what most would consider Classic 80's--more like who the heck are these people 80's."
2,"Hot, hot, hot","Just when you thought JK couldn't state his exact opinion any better, he comes out with this little book of poems. This man clearly has a gift of directness and an uncanny ability with the English language. Who would have thought to rhyme 'Cancel the Dance' with 'Sansabelt pants'..seriously, who? Oh wow. Highly recommend."
1,The Most boring book I ever read,"It had no meaning to me whatsoever. Just a bunch of left wing mumbo jumbo, that's all it was to me. I can't believe that we'll have to listen to this kind of jargon from both Bush and Kerry for the next SEVEN MONTHS! His vision for a better America is just as clear as the meaning behind a poem written by a ""poet"" high on drugs. Give me a break. If people think his war record is shadiest part about him, then they need to read this, because quite frankly I have no idea what in the heck he's talking about."
3,A new Jimmy Carter,He is a new Jimmy Carter. Just what we need in a time of cirses - perhaps not really. He should not have written this book. It is a bad book.
1,Would make a nice bumper sticker,"What else would you expect John Kerry to want you to believe about John Kerry? Would make a great bumper sticker. If you have seen any of John Kerry's ridiculous commercials, you already know what's in this book. The best advice I can give is to skip this book and when Kerry's commercials come on, do what I do, turn the channel! This guy is his own #1 fan and a incredible liar."
1,Lies and the lying traitors who tell them,"Warning. This book is a collection of liberal garbage.Read it but then read the truth about John Kerry in ""Unfit for Command""by John O'Neill.Remember ""A vote for Kerry is a Vote for Osama!"""
4,"Go Johnny Go, Go!","John Kerry's book A Call to Service is a basic overview of his plans to wrest our country from Bush Inc. He's got plans to help our environment, create jobs, a new clean fuel economy, and rejoin the community of Nations. Our country and world will again be safe when President Kerry is sworn in on Jan. 20th, 2005. We've had so many disasters since Jan. 20, 2001 and it's time to get back on track with a man of intelligence, depth, progressive worldview, and get on the road to peace and prosperity.The whole world is waiting for November to see whether we will have 4 more years of disasters or a new direction. It's a hard road until then and if Bush wants to make national security a campaign issue Kerry has 3 words he knows Bush understands: BRING IT ON!!"
1,John Kerry: American Dimwit,"John Kerry continues to amaze. His vision ""for a better America"" includes making fun of our troops, calling them stupid, and accusing them of war crimes. Now, we find out that a woman who donated to his campaign and worked in the Clinton White House leaked sensitive information from the CIA - and Kerry defended her on ABC News!The truth is, America was spared from having this fool as President."
1,More Intellectually Bankrupt Hyperbole,"Why is it that Presidential candidates feel like they have to write a book? John Kerry's ""vision"" that he touts in this book is in actuality nothing more than a tired reproduction of transparent feel-good soundbytes and liberal hyperbole. If this book in fact is evidence of the ""Kerry-vision"" then it's obvious that the Senator hasn't had an original thought since 1962. In short, this book is a waste of paper and a waste of time to read, unless you are either severely retarded or one of the morons who voted for Monsieur kerry."
1,Forget about it,"My vision for a better America: Re-elect George W. Bush and forget about this left-wing, super rich Kennedy (as in Ted) clone."
1,Bumper sticker,"The man looks like a mule, and has about as much sense. It's Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis all over again. A double talking, tax and spend democrat running for president because, well, heck, someone's going to do it. So the man with the smooth forehead who never heard of Botox is running.Keep running, John, keep running. Don't stop at the White House, though, because it's already occupied and the current resident is going to stay there awhile. I doubt he'll be reading your book, but who will? It's not a book, it's a bumper sticker."
1,What a load of....,"What a load of dung! You don't need to go to the internet for facts, just read his other book ""The New Soldier"" to really understand what he stands for. He's not fit to wear a military uniform. And giving this book one star is one start too many. Read both to confirm your own faith in REAL AMERICANS like GW Bush, not a two-faced anti-American like Kerry."
1,a JFK want-to-be,"common misconceptions- People still think JFK was a Democrat, People think John Kerry isn't a flaming liberal who has nothing to offer this country. Tell the man to either stop running or get back to his job in Mass. missing 87% of the votes is just sad. Not to mention that in his 20 or so years, he's probably introduced as many bills as ""Bill's wife"" in 2 years. Bush is going to take Kerry down in 04 and Rudy/McCain in 08 will sweep the nation. Kerry goes back and forth on EVRY issue- our country is at war. He is by no means presidential material."
2,a disappointed overseas reader,"Those who like John Kerry or voted for him will love his book. Those who wanted something to sink their teeth into will be disappointed. I was. His writing is verbose and prosaic, and I became impatient with his unrelenting stream of consciousness style. Kerry's views in this book lack intellectual rigor or pith and have a pedestrian, sophomoric appeal of the commonplace. It actually put me to sleep. After having read it, I still don't have any larger insight into Kerry's political philosophy and I have the impression that I was just supposed to get into a sort of feely John Kerry state of being. His title promised a vision but the result was more a glimmer. I bought this book in an overseas bookstore at more than it's cover price and wish I could send it back to him for a return on my money."
5,Highly Recommended!,"Former President Bill Clinton once remarked that running against an incumbent president is like an extended job interview with the American people. First you must convince them to vote the other fellow out of office, and then you must convince them that you would be a suitable replacement. In some ways this book is John Kerry's extended epistle to the American people, explaining why he's the right man for the job. Author Kerry demonstrates an impressive grasp of the issues, and yet explains them in a Clintonesque, common-sense manner. The book uses italicized anecdotes from Kerry's past, pastiches cleverly woven throughout its fabric, to give the reader a sense of Kerry's past without dwelling on it. This is much more a book about the future, and Kerry's vision for America and how he intends to achieve it. We recommend this most highly for those who seek a better understanding of the man carrying the Democratic banner into the electoral battle."
5,The Take-Away,"Virginia Brackett has successfully shown why personal criticism is a form of criticism that the academic world should embrace. Commercial writers (those who want substantial dollars for their work) have long known that a novel must have a take-away that a reader can apply to his/her own life if the novel is to be of any value. In a conversational tone, Brackett shows how literary works have impacted her life, weaving personal stories of divorce, custody battle, the death of her mother, her quest for education, and her professional writings with critical studies. She has also shown how her life experiences have changed the way she views literary works and broadened her understanding. As Brackett's life journey changed directions, feminist issues gained importance, and in this volume she views gender roles in literature and in reality."
4,"High quality, modern, and looks good","I would have given it 4 stars if all the brushes in our household fit. It will fit most brushes, but it won't fit some of the newer brushes that are trending towards giant, ergomic, pistol-grip nonsense. Avoid those and you will be fine."
5,An excellent usable resource,"This is one of the best books on gifted children I have read. I think it is particularly valuable because it focuses less on schooling concerns and more on dealing with the specific issues these children deal with. There are chapters on stress management, motivation, peers, and feelings, to name a few, and each chapter gives tips on how parents can help kids with these issues. This is a great book, and I find myself referring to it often!"
2,Very little practical help,"Too much psychobabble with little practical help that hasn't been offered a thousand times before. The book should focus more on the opportunities the giftedness creates for the child both in education and in living a richer life. Developing the ""hungry mind"" is key, and not letting the child's curiosity be stifled by a lowest-common-denominator public schooling system. A much better book was ""Bringing Out the Best: A Resource Guide for Parents of Young Gifted Children."""
2,Too Negative and Alarmist,"The book starts out with an anecdote about a gifted child who committed suicide, and continues with other warnings and horror stories about stress, discipline, depression and underachieving in gifted children. Although much of the information is potentially valuable, it is presented in a pseudo-scholarly manner that takes much of the joy away from the challenge of raising a gifted child. Like my son, I was labeled as highly gifted as a child, and after reading the book, I am grateful to be functioning and not on Prozac. A more simplistic but much more enlightening book on the subject is ""The Survival Guide for Parents of Gifted Kids"" by Sally Yahnke Walker."
5,reader,"I first read this book in 1989, when my first-born began school. She is now a young adult, has read the book, and thanks me for following the advice. It is timeless. I have since bought 11 more copies, as gifts for friends, as well as re-reading my own copy countless times, as my next 2 children were also identified gifted. I was also fortunate to find a parent group that was based on the topics of the book. It was the most positive and helpful parenting support I ever received."
5,Truly a Classic,This book was used for a parent support group when our first child started a gifted program. The group was lead by a child psychologist who picked the book out and I can see why. It is well written and comprehensive. We have gone back to the book for our second child and have given it to others.Very helpful-- an excellent reference from childhood to adulthood.
4,helpful guide to raising a gifted child,"Even though the book was written some time ago, the conclusions re: emotional and psychological ""tolls"" of being gifted remain accurate. I would recommend reading the open letter to the parents of gifted children that appears at the end of the book first - you realize immediately that you are not alone, but that in our culture it is not acceptable to discuss, or God forbid complain, about any aspects of your child's giftedness."
5,Great read for parents of gifted children.,"This book is beneficial not just for older gifted children, but for younger ones as well. It holds a great deal of information for parents to understand and guide their gifted child/children. I enjoyed this book."
1,BOOOORING! No wonder it's discontinued by F.P.,"I disagree with the previous two reviews, on whose recommendations I paid good money for this CD. I was so impressed with the Fisher-Price Little People ""Birthday Party Fun"" CD (we absolutely LOVE it!) that I wanted to get some more. So far, I have purchased this one and the ""Songs from the Farm"" CD's. We basically dislike all the songs on both of these two CD's. Many are completely different from the versions you are used to; my 13-year old said ""Mom, this CD is depressing."" I really wish I hadn't wasted my money. Maybe I can sell them on Ebay....I also have ""Baby Boogie"", and at least it has upbeat songs, but no words, and the tunes are different than you'd expect. If you want a really wonderful, upbeat, energizing CD for your toddler / young child, hold out for the ""Birthday Party Fun"" CD."
3,Festival but no triumph,"Festival displays the always-fine guitar of Carlos Santana and the keyboards of Tom Coster, and has some high points. There are two standout pretty tracks: the acoustic, Brazilian (and sort of flamenco) ""Verao Vermelho"" and the haunting ""Revelations,"" with its fine guitar work speeding up, as in ""Europa."" The lively ""Carnaval"" and ""Jugando"" contain excellent performances by Chepito Areas and the rest of the percussion section. However, these songs and others, verseline and music, lack the edge of Santana's earlier days, instead showcasing plain-sounding Latin rhythms, and the other softer songs are of lesser quality. In addition, Carlos' latter-day inclination to delve into mediocre funk pops up on a number of tracks, not of interest to me, and many. Santana would display a brief return to form on the studio tracks of the immediately subsequent Moonflower, but Festival is another example of the phasing out of the excellent sound of the group's first six years."
4,Don't knock it till you try it,"I'd just like to say that 20+ years ago, this was my very first introduction to Santana and Latin music in general - a mere child, someone inadvertently left their 331/3rpm Festival Album at my house - which I (hands up here) admittedly snuck into my bedroom to play on my mini radio/record player and fell totally in love with Carlos Santana (PS I still have the LP!). From that day to this have been and will always be an avid fan, so don't listen to any reviews about his old music being naff or not a patch on today's current mainstream stuff, this is where it all began remember, buy it, listen to it, savour it and above all ENJOY it! If you're not sure about Santana, this is an ideal introduction."
4,SANTANA ALBUM,"I only really like one song on this album, REVELATIONS, but I'm sure it will grow on me. I think Santana's great."
4,And how are you raising your child?,"Imagine you have a child. How will you teach her to live, to find goodness? Well, surprise: you have always had one. How are you answering these questions for your own life?So asks Mitchell's first book-length foray into outright philosophy. This book is not as humorous as his other ones; it is more disturbing, more unsettling, but still, equally brilliant. Rather than again tackle what bad language and educationist silliness bodes for ""society,"" he makes you consider what your cherished beliefs, assumptions, and actions bode for you personally. And you will finish this book realizing how important it is to be thoughtful-- perhaps more so than from his other books. A masterpiece."
4,"Pretty Good, I think","We have this recording, but I have no idea where we got it! This is a pretty nice recording. It holds the interest of my older son, age 3. He sings along with the first track, ""Twinkle, Twinkle,..."" and sometimes ""bops"" a little bit to the other tracks. I like that it is not all electronic, and is cheery. It's nice background music for play time. I'll admit I am not familiar with a lot of classical music recordings for children, but I do have a music degree."
2,not the best book on this topic,"There are very few useful tidbits of information in this book. The ideas presented weren't particularly creative or inspiring. You'd be much better served with a copy of ""Dream Sewing Spaces"" by Lynnette Ranney Black."
4,One of the best!,"This book is a masterpiece, even though it is written in a style that's a bit arcane. Giesbrecht really knows her business. She even teaches a course on this subject at QuiltUniversity.com!"
5,Setting Up Your Sewing Space: From Small Areas To Complete Workshops,"Product received and in good condition. Not a lot of colored pictures of room layouts, but good information for designing your space to sew."
3,Waited 30 days & never rec'd my 1st order or my refund,"I used one of your used vendors and never received the book. My money (for the initial purchase) has not yet been refunded. It has been more than 30 days. NO Book...NO REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!I then had to have a new order shipped overnight because I have an exam and really needed the book for my class.I really feel that I have been F'ed over by this entire process. I do not trust your associated vendors.Please, please...see to it that my first order funds are REFUNDED to my account. I had been one of your best advocates about your service. Not sure I would recommend purchasing from you again."
5,good little pump,The medium Sunterra Fountain Pump works well in my small movable garden waterfall it pumps the water up about 2.5 feet with a good strong flow. And the cord is long (6 feet) for easy attachment to an extension cord. It has a two ended attachment piece which will fit a standard piece of plastic hosing for the fountain. The price is right also.
5,Great product for the price.,"I needed a replacement fountain pump and going by reviews, bought this one. Works very well, is quiet and does not use much power."
4,Good little unit,We've had Sunterra products for years and are pleased to get 2-4 years out of their little pumps. It performs as advertised. I like the 16 foot extension cord too.
3,works,"well, it does pump and is easy to set the desired flow but it is not maintenance free.... lets face it, water does get dirty no matter where you live, and in the south it takes about 1 week to get algae... I do wish the instructions really told you how to take it apart, not just an exploded view of the pump assembly..."
4,Works Great!,"I use this pump in an outdoor fountain and it works great. The long power cord makes it even better, because now I do not have to use an extention cord."
3,Not the best,Not the fault of Amazon but the product was too small for the usage I needed It would have helped if the on screen description would have been a little better
2,the pump,The pump worked fine but it was to small to do the job. It did not have enough power to send the water up into the fountain like it should.
2,Doesn't pump enough water,This product DOES NOT pump the quoted water. It barely trickles on all the settings.
4,"noticeable hum, roughly 2gpm at 2 foot rise","It's definitely less noisy than the water flowing in my (noisy) 21 inch rise fountain, but you can still hear a low hum from 10 feet away. It could be annoying with a quiet fountain.Turned down all the way, the flow adjustment doesn't lower the flow much; *maybe* down to 3/4 of its normal flow. I cut a small hole in my 1/2 inch tube to lower the flow a bit more, right above where it connects to the pump. It works fine so far, but I've only had it running a short time.NOTE: If you have a tight space to fit your pump, it's actually bigger than listed, at about 3.25 X 3.5 x 1.5 inches. I submitted a change request, but my pump is already installed and it's not worth it to drain and disassemble the whole fountain just to send photos of measurements to Amazon or Sunterra to justify the correct numbers."
3,"Sunterra 114516 Medium Fountain Pump, 130 GPH","Pump works great right out of the box. Have a 2-3 ft lift as stated is a stretch. The unit just does make it to the top of our fountain with no room to spare. My previous pump was smaller and did a better job. As a word of advice, buy at least one level higher than your needs. You can always adjust it down if too strong!"
4,Quite Pleased,"Pumps water as expected. I have not measured flow, but it is satisfactory for me. I was pleased how little electricity this pump uses.How long will it last? I don't know, but I've had it over a year and it has been running continuously the whole time. I like it."
5,Worked like a charm,"I have a fountain that is about 6 years old and the pump stopped working.I am not very mechanically oriented but I found it very easy to replace. I did not need any tools. I just emptied out the old water, pulled the hoses off, then slipped the new one on and it was very exciting to see it work immediately after I added the water and plugged it in."
5,God still wants to work in lives of ordinary people.,"The Demos Shakarian story is about God's presence in our lives, and the miracles He will perform when we let Him, when we're willing to get out of the way to let Him take over. Mr. Shakarian's story is about a loving God and a loving son, whose heart wants to be in his Father's perfect will, but being human, forgets, and gets in the way. And God waits until he figures that out, steps back, and lets Him lovingly fix everything, often seeing miracles as Father God worked in his life, and in the lives of the people around him. It is a book of hope, of promise, and of love, things we all need and often forget where to go to get them. It was exactly what I needed to read, and I highly recommend it to others."
5,Incredible!!,"I have heard about this book, but till you actually read it for yourself, hearing about it does not do it justice! I am usually a slow reader, but from the time I opened the first page I was captivated by the ""flow"" of the story, and the message in it. Before I knew it 2 hours later I had finished the book! Demos Shakarian was truly a messenger from God, his life was centered around the vision God gave to him and he would not compromise on the goal that was set before him. Though God blessed him in the physical realm, it never clouded his judgment or the vision God gave to him. It was truly a remarkable story, about being led by the Spirit of God! This book and Demos's life has been an encouragement in my life!"
5,best book i ever read,"this is the most fabulous story of a family's simple journey of faith, from certain death in armenia, to a prosperous life in southern california as dairyman, in the middle of the last century. it is filled with joy, sorrow, pain, triumph, and is a wonderful testament to the ever-present Presence and power of God, if we but look for Him. BEST. BOOK. EVER."
5,A Must Read!! :),This book is a must read for those who have a Pentecostal or a Charismatic background. This book helps a person understand the power of our living God and that he has not changed in helping those who seek him. The book is about how God led a group of Armenians out of Armenia so that they would escape the Armenian Genocide.PS: This book is also a good read for those who are interested in knowing about Armenians or another culture.
3,Needs to be colorized if possible,These Gable movies are OK would be better if the seller could colorize the copies of the movie. I have never understood why not colorize
3,Could have had a better selection.,"The best DVD in this boxset is ""San Francisco"", an incredible movie with great DVD special features. The chemistry between Clark Gable and Jeanette MacDonald is pure magic.My 3 star rating of this set is due to the selection of films contained in it. Boomtown wasn't bad, but it's kinda hokey. Wife VS secretary wasn't Gable's best either. This set would have been phenomenal if it included ""Red Dust"", ""Mutiny on the bounty"", and Gables final film ""The misfits"". While the selection of films aren't my favorite, I do appreciate the great special features in each of the DVD's."
5,A Clark Gable set NOT to be missed!,"Clark Gable at his best! There is such a wide variety of supporting casts that you will never get tired or bored with any of the movies. A MUST have for any Clark Gable fan. There is drama, music, comedy and action everywhere. A great collection for any mood; just sit back, relax and enjoy. You have it all here. If the studios produce other box collections half as good as this one then my wife and I will own them all."
4,Overall good,Some aspects of the show seemed rushed but I really can't find anything worth pointing out...male lead is awesome and the supporting cast is funny but like I said its obvious it was rushed
4,Good but short...,"Enjoyed watching this, but I agree with everyone here:Its short, and it becomes worse after Ep. 5-7Though its not that bad like it sounds but the 1st half was very enjoyable and the 2nd half was not..Hard to find an explanation for what actually happened.Animation- and sound-quality is ok.At least the end was ok..."
3,Good but not Great,"The overall show is decent. The characters are good too. Even the storyline is good. The thing that bugs me is that it feels sort of rushed. The dubbed is bad. The for some of the characters, the mouths still move even though they're are done talking (I'm seeing this all too often these days).There are a lot of funny parts though, nudity (full frontals & all that. In some scenes, they show everything). A decent amount of sexual jokes (Both visual & conversational). Lots of explosions to boot.All in all, it's original.Could it have been done better? Yes, it damn well could have.Worth buying? Yes, to pass time (but not for this price).Character growth? Not really but enough to progress the story a bit.For kids? HELL NO! lol"
5,"Pretty good, a rarity for a Harem piece","Not gonna beat around the bush, this series combines fan service, a harem plotline, comedy and romance into a surprisingly good combination. However it's a Sentai Filmworks release which means based on their track record it will almost certainly be sub-only, more than likely with low quality audio. The series does feel a little rushed at times, but considering this is one of the few series I have seen with a happy ending I don't mind. Just one thing: the title was mistranslated. Anyone who knows some of the Japanese terminology can tell you that the current title translates to Demon King Great Demon King."
4,Surprised,"Hadn't watched any of it until I bought it, its a decent series but not for everyone. Still I enjoyed the art style and the goofiness of the story so while I won't highly recommend it, it is still worth looking at if you enjoy anime"
4,I Found Underground Water!!,"I do not know why but that line had me laughing. This is one of the few Harem types that I liked. English voices were outstanding and being a fan service anime there is nudity and panty shots all over the place but the story is much more.Akuto Sai wants to be a priest but he is told in front everyone at school that he is prophesied to be the Demon King.Hence the trouble ensues and people are afraid while others are attracted to him.This has a nice balance of action and comedy while Chris Patton does an incredible job with the English voice. As far as the disc goes this is bright and crisp bluray and the animation is above average pretty much for the whole series.Now will you like this....I do not know as it all comes down to personal tastes. It is definitely worth a watch...stream it,then decide, I know Crunchyroll has it for free and Netflix has it as well, just not free."
5,Excellent!,"i watched this anime before and i figured since it was so good id buy it. over all its 10/10, i strongly recomend this series to any one."
5,An original and thrilling work!,"Wow!! As an ""average joe,"" I rarely read historical romance novels, but having read Ms. Helton's first two novels, I had to read the third. Did I say ""read?"" DEVOUR would be a better word! This work is not only original, but exciting, intriguing, and spell-binding as well. Really takes one into the action. As a pilot, and skydiver, I STILL got butterflies in my stomach living the adventure with these two heroes! Soaring aloft in a gas rosin balloon, with enemy-fire and a cadre of villains tracking them relentlessly--not to mention the terror of Mother Nature's fury! This would make an excellent ""Romancing The Stone"" type of movie. BRAVO!! Can't wait for the next one!"
5,4 year old loved it!,"This takes time to use...which is a good thing! It captured my 4 year old's imagination and held it for some time. To chisel the rock away, one must be patient. Watch out for the dust. Use a mask or play in an area with good air flow."
4,Book has nothing to do with Franklin,"This book has been mistaken for the similar title by Mr. Cookman, the Cookman title is 'Ice Blink' and this book is 'Iceblink'. This book is a children and young adult fictionalized acount of an Inuit man in the 1750s who is banished from his tribe because he is accused of stealing when the tribe, the Metak, is starving to death. He wanders from place to place, eventually meeting a Russian Trawler. The book is excellent for 7-9 year olds."
4,In Search of the NW Passage,"This book did an excellent job of surveying Sir John Franklin's ill-fated final attempt for the NW Passage. It walks the reader through a world of greed that was the man responsible for the disaster. You, the reader, find out that it was sloppy canning techniques that spoiled the food that the voyage depended upon, and ultimately led to the abandoning of the ships in search of help. As far as we know today, no one survived the expedition, and Cookman does an excellent job of tracing the route that the dwindling survivors may have taken in search of aid. A must read for True Adventure book enthusiasts."
4,Hoped for more,"While quite entertaining, the very childlike depiction of combat & violence tended to take me out of the story, as it really felt ""staged"". Overall, the production values are very high. Recommended."
5,robin of sherwood,"When i was a younger i fell in love with robin of sherwood. To me this is one of the most realistic shows about the tale of Robin Hood. I love the fact that there was no fact accents, no blatant rip offs. The cast worked very well together. I loved the music it made the show more alive. I still wish this was on tv."
5,Immersed in Sherwood,"I remember this series when it was originally on TV. Now it's all here on DVD and I got one. Yes!Lost memories return and become vivd as this series takes me back once again to those wonderful childhood days spent in our own Sherwood Forest when we were the ""good guys"" and ""the bad guys!"" What fun to watch this series and be transported, for a short while, back to Sherwood and, once again, become part of ""the gang.""Get it. You won't regret it. I'm going to send a set to my nephews. Maybe they'll forget their game cards and electronic gadgets and get back to some real fun found only in their imagination."
4,True fans won't want to miss this one,I rented a few of these in '86 - had no idea that it was a series. I've never forgotten this Robin. Michael P. was a great Robin Hood and so was Jason Connery. I can't wait to see all the episodes I missed. I would recommend these to anyone who is a true fan of the Robin Hood Legend.
5,Love this show,I have been wanting this DVD set for a long time. The shows are as good as I remember. I just wish that Michael Praed had not left the show after the second season. It would have last longer then 3 seasons if he had stayed.
5,Finally a wide release,"For those not able to get the ""Robin of Sherwood Complete Series"" Region 1 box set put out a few years ago, this release is a long time coming. It appears that all the special features in the box set are reproduced here, so there is nothing new that early adopters are missing. For those who are not yet aware, this is perhaps the best Robin Hood television show ever produced, and it has tremendous staying power. Both Robin the commoner and Robin the nobleman are woven into this series, which makes it unique.True, Michael Praed (later replaced by blonde pansy Jason Connery) and his crew are pretty darn clean for living out in the woods, but it just wouldn't be as much fun to watch a bunch of scruffy, dirty ruffians. Also worthy of note are the guest appearances by Richard ""Riff Raff"" O'Brien. So throw your verisimilitude out the window and sit down to some quality yarn spinning!"
1,ITEM RECEIVED NOT AS DISPLAYED,THE ITEM PICTURED ON AMAZON IS A MEDIUM-SIZE BLUE AND GOLD PEN. THE ITEM I RECEIVED (TWO TIMES) IS A MEDIUM TO LARGE-SIZE STAINLESS STEEL AND VIOLET PEN. EITHER THE AMAZON PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION OR THE ACTUAL ITEM SHIPPED NEEDS TO CHANGE SO THAT BOTH THE DESCRIPTION AND THE ITEM SHIPPED MATCH.
1,Parker Infection Tranquil Blue Ballpoint Pen Fine Tip,"This pen is made in UK not France, and it sucks. It is easily fall apart if you not careful, the tip gold part is very lose so it is the middle part, it is just pushed together to hold. I am gonna throw this away."
2,mislead,I received different color and I think different model.I am ordering this from overseas therefore returning is not straightforward. Luckily I wanted it for a gift and it still worked.
1,Imitation,This is very poor imitation of a Parker pen.The product described here is not even close to the one you will receive.
1,Good for pruning trees,These rip a steak apart rather than cut. If I'm ever in need of a saw I can always use these
4,great for the price,"Need extra steak knives? You can't go wrong with these. I was surprised at the weight and feel of these functional steak knives. At this price I expected them to be much lighter. As for function (that is what we buy them for!) these knives are sharp and sturdy, and cut through steak easily. At this price I suggest you buy extras before they run out."
2,More Like a Hacksaw,"These knives look great and even have a nice feel to them, but they cut like a hacksaw. The serated edge is such that the knives rip the meat apart rather than slice through it. At this price, they are sufficient to use at a beach house, or take on a camping trip, but I wouldn't use them at a dining table with a tablecloth."
5,Obie Watson a Hero's hero,An exciting and romantic story. Once you start it's difficult to put down.
5,Great heater that won't blow circuits,I bought this space heater because I have a small office in an older poorly heated building. The space heaters out that are easily available at the discount stores used too much electricity and we were constantly blowing circuits at work. This heater keeps me warm and uses much less electricity. So I can be toasty without blowing circuits. This heater would probably not work well for a large space though or a cubicle style office that didn't have a door to keep the heat in.
5,This does the job,"I bought two of these on the basis of recommendations written here and so far I'm not disappointed.Both worked fine out of the box (no quality issues) and are just right for how I use them (to heat the tv viewing area and the small home office). I am now able to turn down the thermostat to 65 or less and not suffer feeling cold in the two places I sit for long periods.I agree with other comments that the heat is pleasantly like that from the sun. I appreciate the silent, gentle heat, good up to about 6 feet away on the high setting. It seems like a well-designed unit with thoughtful touches like a holster that clips on the side of the heater to hold the remote (which works well).For considerably less money than what I would have paid at Costco for their similar parabolic heater, I have a comparable unit without the waste of a night-light (what's that all about?). It is also powered by a metal coil, not the quartz or other mineral lights that cause complaints about being too bright."
2,Alarm feature,"This heater seems to be a great buy, but after some use, the alarm comes on from time to time. Then it comes on and stays on, even after unplugging the heater. It is a waste of money for me. I do not understand why this thing does not reset itself. I google troubleshooting the thing and was disappointed to find that you had to have some ""handyman"" knowledge to attempt to check it. Otherwise it is suggested to replace it.Some Deal:("
3,THE BEST PART OF THIS IS THE COVER PHOTO,"Unfortunately, the original albums, with those great ""cheesecake"" covers, just are not available on CD. It indeed is surprising that the Japanese, usually so meticulous with totally original and complete reissuing, would even bother releasing a best-of compilation. I'm sure the audio mastering is world-best--that's the one attribute you can always count on from the Japanese, thankfully (while EU issues continue to be butchered with added, fake stereo effects)."
4,hot hot hot,"Warren Haynes and Matt Abts return with new players Danny Lewis and Andy Hess on keyboard and bass respectively for a rebirth of one of the most intense bands working. While I prefered the stylistic breadth of the Deep End projects, this is in my opinion the best Mule CD as a self contained unit. While the instinctive communication between Haynes and the late Alan Woody is missing, overall the band burns with a purpose.Standouts include Bad Man Walking, Slackjaw Jezebel, Wine and Blood, Lola Leave Your Light On, Little Toy Brain, and New World Blues"
2,Guess I'm just not a fan,I heard great things about them but I guess I wasn't really familiar with their work - either that or this particular album just isn't for me. Then again I'm not a blues fan so maybe that's the problem. The first tune is catchy but the rest is not funked up enough for my taste.
4,it's gov't mule ... how bad could it be??,"Paying a little attention, I noticed RS gave this disc a two star rating, and the lame REM disc a 3 star ... go figure. After hearing both, only one will get played again ... this one!!While it may not be ""quite"" as good as some of the Mule's earlier discs, it's guitar rocking blues ... there's not one faux rap song, ... and it's a good listen.Guitar rock ... decent, hard-working, southern,countrified blues/rock ... it's better than most any/all of the newer stuff ... if you like rock, this'll be good to you."
3,Pretty Good,This cd is ok but not a long time mule fan would expect.It sounds more like Warren Haynes solo stuff not Gov't Mule.Still worth buying though.I only gave it 3 stars because it just doesn't stand up as their previous recordings.Still my favorite band!
5,A Blues Rock Masterpiece!,"My first listen to Warren Haynes was on his solo album ""Tales of Ordinary Madness"" (which I also give 5 stars). I since lost track of him with his tenure in Government Mule, but what a mistake that was. ""Deja Voodoo"" is one of the best albums I've purchased this year, and Warren & company shine on this collection of blues/rock tracks, and especially the songs that are dark, moody and down-tempo. Highly recommended."
3,Worth the price,"One feature I do not like about this radio is that you have to ""scan"" for your station, there is no manual tuning. Also, the clock is very faint and difficult to see in the daytime. The sound is OK, about what I would expect."
1,Another garbage GPX product,"I bought a 7"" TV (product review is on its own page), and this GPX clock radio at the same shot. I am very disapointed to say that both items were a complete waste of my money. I had to send the clock radio in since it didn't work at all and I have had all of the same problems listed from other buyers on my junk TV. I would steer clear of any GPX product."
2,Very dissapointed,"I purchased this product for my 16 year old son. The radio didn't display anywhere what station you were on, so you had to listen and guess. Sound quality was not good either."
2,A shocker!!,"My 86 yr old Mother loved Mario and watched his movies on a regular basis. She recently asked me to get her a book about his life. So this is the one I ordered. To make a long story short...she returned the book to me along with ALL her dvd's of his movies!!! She was shocked to read about what kind of a man he was. To put it all in a nutshell he ONLY wanted virgins...he wanted to always be the ""first"". I had NO interest in the man so I threw out the book along with the dvds. Nothing against the author...it's Mario that my mother no longer likes!!"
4,I couldn't believe the price!!!,"Haven't been using them long, but for the price, if they are only half as good, I'm still coming out ahead of the rest."
2,don't fit right,"I have ordered compatible cartridges before wiothout a problem- but these are so awful...I really wish I hadn't gotten so many! They do not fit properly. The black is streaky, fades out even when freshly installed.Well, I have 24 wrapped cartridges and have to get new ones :(The cannon printers are terrific. When mine blew out from a surge we looked high & low because it is just about the only one out there with reasonably priced ink. I wish I hadn't tried to save pennies because it is going to cost me big as there really aren't good for anything and need to be tossed. The cost of mailing them back. from hawaii, and the partial credit I would get because some are used... it's a total loss.Why 2 stars? they shipped fast/ packed well...the product itself is the pits (and, I will note, the box is marked as being for a range of printers which do not accept the same cartridge). Takes several tries to seat it... bad choice."
4,Enjoyable story,Good story by Marie Bostwick. Sometimes I wanted more details about the interesting events going on in the story and she would jump ahead to another scene or even to another point in time.
2,A So So Read 2-1/2 STARS,"Before I state my opinion, let me just say that The River's Edge is a well-written book. There's nothing wrong with the writing, or story line. I gave it a 2-1/2 stars because it is not my cup of tea. It was a bit slow for me and too ""clean."" It read to me like a Christian type of book that I would pick up at a Christian bookstore. Again, nothing wrong with that, it's just not for me. It felt a little drawn out for me, but it wasn't a bad book."
3,Toronto's most famous bar band,Teenage Heads third and most polished album. Not as good as the first two.
3,AG RECoil,"I am not sure how I like this product yet. I have been using it about a month now. I keep experimenting with it and different products. It has not changed my hair dramatically though. I will say that I received it promtly through Amazon, and was happy with the service, just not sure with product and for the money I feel I probably should like it more than I do."
3,Not for super fine hair.,"I could see this product working very well on coarse or kinky hair. My curls, though nicely defined, were completely weighed down, and I didn't even use that much. Also, I prefer to let my hair air dry, and with this stuff, you need to blow dry or your hair will be stiff. And unfortunately, heavy products double hair-drying time for me. I'll stick to mousse--faster drying and more volume for fine hair."
2,Made my hair stiff didn't like it!!,"Didn't like it, I looked at the video and it seemed to be what I wanted. However, upon putting a light coat on my curly hair like in the video it was stiff. Horrible to the touch. Like spraying it with a lot of hair spray. I did follow the directions. Would never buy or use it again. If someone wants it for free they can have it. It's just sitting in my bathroom and taking up clutter space......."
2,not impressed,"After reading all the positive reviews I had high hopes for this product. It left my hair stringy, did not help create curl, and had a weird residue. Oh well, on to the next."
3,Good but not great,"Being a curly hair gal, im always striving to find just the right product to make my curls the best....well this was almost it.Pros: hair felt soft and gave it a lot of volume, did define my curlsCons: went through a drying ""tacky"" stage, not much forgiving room, and once it started to dry it was almost impossible to touch whit out making the curls friz due to the ""tackiness of the product.A good quality moose makes my curls the same as this product made them but the best thing about AG Hair Recoil was the volume it gave my hair it didn't weigh it down."
4,Great for managing naturally curly hair,"I have been using this product for about four years and love it. It has been difficult to find other than on line. I was especially happy with the larger size and the ""pump"" as opposed to the tube. Easier to use and more economical."
3,Wavy hair,"I have used other products from this company and loved them. But now, the one I loved is discontinued. So I ordered this to try out. It is totally different. I feel it doesn't really help ""re-coil"" hair like it says it does. I do like that my hair feels soft, which is a surprise for me, because I have coarse thick hair and usually does not feel soft when curly."
2,Not impressed,"I purchased this product, after reading reviews, hoping it would encourage some of the natural waves/curls in my hair. I followed the directions (multiple times) and had mediocre results. I am not impressed. Product is a little heavy (even when I put on just a small amount of product) and if not combed out and the product dries in hair it becomes crunchy and stiff. Waves and curls are ""okay"" at best. I will not buy this product again nor will I recommend it to a friend. Overall, for the price and the performance, I am disappointed.Mindy Weiss"
1,just awful,Reviews are so great for this ag recoil I got this cuz ppl said it was good on natural curly hair like mine and to my surprise I did not like at all had a lot of stringy pieces in my hair and left it more of a wavy not as curly.
3,Good for a home studio,"This reformer is good as a home reformer. It is easy to use and setup is easy. However, it is not a professional reformer. It is somewhat shorter than a professional one. It lacks a few features like an adjustable footbar. I had to purchase optional accessories like a stand, box, rebounder and pole. These cost a few hundred dollars, all together. It would be more cost effective to get one with a stand and rebounder. If you are tall or long legged, you will sometimes feel cramped using this one."
5,Excellent home pilates!,"As a physical therapist, I can vouch for the sturdiness and smooth, versatile function of this machine. I recommend it to all of my clients if they have the space. As I said, sturdy and well made. My other machine is the Pilates Reformer. A+"
2,Annoying,"I purchased this CD after reading the mostly positive reviews on Amazon. My 2 1/2-year-old loves music and dancing so this seemed like a good choice. It turns out I do not like this CD at all. Not a real instrument on the thing. It sounds like the crappy demo music from a cheap keyboard, or bad techno music from some deranged raver. However, the beat was fast and tolerable for my son. There are no lyrics, which is fine because he can recognize a lot of the songs and try to fill in the words - which is bad for me because I feel obligated to help him sing along and coach him when I really just want to turn the music off. Seriously, like fingernails on a chalk board if you like or have ever even heard a real instrument. I gave 2 stars because my son likes it."
3,Very fast beat with no words!,Perhaps my baby is just too young to appreciate this one. The beat is very fast and there are no words. I was hoping for more of a sing along rather than a techno track.
2,It does not hold a Charge,The other reviewer is 100% correct. The iboost when charged and left unused will only last about 2 days. Then the red starts to flash and then it is out of battery. You then have to charge it again and it will last you another 2 days if not used. But if you do use it it will last a while. Like 10 hours for 1st gen and 20 for second gen. That is if you use it immedialty after it is done charging. Warning also could cause your battery to be out of sync!!!!!!I gave a 2 stars because I brought my Ipod to listen to school everyday. (I had a TA class where I listen to music and grade papers) So it worked for that becuase I consitinly charged the battery everyday. But if you are looking for a Battery Pack that is more realiable and is recharagable (that could replace your depleting battery) look further. This is not what you are looking for.
1,Unreliable Product and Service,"I purchased a Nyko iBoost Battery Pack for an iPod mini back in December and it started failing within two months of purchase. After six months it failed to hold a charge. I notified Amazon about this and they also could not back up the product with a replacement or partial refund. Do not buy this product as there is no guarantee, either from Amazon or the manufacturer. I suggest buying an external pack (i.e. Belkin) in which the batteries are separate and can be easily charged and replaced. Chalk it up to a painful lesson learned about buying things like this from Amazon."
4,Super soft,"These towels soften with every wash, they are ""thirsty"" but retain a very silky feel, I love them.(I gave them 4 stars because after the first wash some threads came loose. I had to trim them and the towel seems fine but I dont know if they are going to wear well meaning I worry more threads may come loose?)"
3,bead seat,"Looks great but wears a little thin after several months. The stitching came unraveled but for the price, I didn't expect much more."
4,Good value,"I got this because of lower back pain, and I spend a lot of time in the car. I'm hoping this may help, but it's a little to early yet to know. It does seem to give better support than the car seat itself."
3,"Beautiful, wanton butchery","The sound of these instruments in duo is exquisite. The performances here are stunning. Itzhak's violin sings in the hands of its master. Mr. Williams' mastery of the guitar is no less great in its power to move. It's not what is performed, but what isn't, that caused this recording by venerable masters to ruffle my feathers. All but one of the variations where the guitar assumes a lead role are edited out of the second movement of Giuliani's op. 25, perhaps Giuliani's finest chamber work. What Giuliani intended as an interesting dialog between instrumental peers has been reduced to Guitar as dog in service to master Violin with the toss of only one bone for its efforts. Simply wrong."
5,Fascinating Book for Al l Ages,"Although this book is clearly aimed at teenagers, I think that adults would also find it very interesting. It is well organized with good pictures and talks about real-life newly discovered mystery monsters (such as the Megamouth shark). I found it fascinating and I think anyone interested in aquatic life would also find it so."
5,inspiring,"This video was the first belly dance video I ever bought, and it inspired me to persist in my dance classes and practice at home. It is very inspiring to see how a professional dancer builds an artistic whole out of bits we learn in class. I know that this video is old and Suhaila's dance style has changed completely since then, but for me this tape has a sentimental value! I loved the costumes, the way shimmies were incorporated in Suhaila's dance, even though longer shimmy sections look too static to me. I liked the first set with sheer curtains, even though the space is clearly small, it looked like real theater."
5,Gidget - The complete series,I was always a fan of beach shows and movies. Sally Field as Gidget was a great casting choice. I was a faithful viewer of the show and am enjoying seeing this series again.
5,Thank-You Thank-You Thank-You!!!!!,"...for finally getting this out on DVD, been waiting forever! Today's television is so horrible, trendy, will never hold up years from now when watching it! someone (all of 'em) in hollywood needs to really watch and remember when actors/actresses actually did their job well...one shining example is ""Gidget""."
5,Lots of Fun,"Rewatching these episodes of Gidget was like walking back through time. I watched Gidget when I was a teenager being raised by my single father. I used to dress like her, talk like her, and could identify with her. I thoroughly enjoy owning these DVDs. I only wish it had run more than one season!"
3,not much surfing,"high quality production, stories usually revolve around gidgets anxiety in relation to her current ""crush""/surfer boy at the beach.field is a pleasure to watch as is the straight laced portrayal of a middle class 60's LA family.unfortunatly there is not much surfing !!( some nice long boards though)."
4,Well done teen comedy,"First of all, Sally Field was fantastic in this part - she was a surprisingly good actress and gets the maximum impact out of every line, delivering them like a pro. This is a teen comedy that stands out because of the good scripts, pleasant sarcasm in the dialogue, and acting of Sally Field and Don Porter. The series only lasted one season because its appeal never broadened past the teen audience - also, the teen world was changing rapidly in 1965-66. What was cool one week seemed like ancient history the next. A fun time trip to the past."
4,Love this show,I grew up watching Gidget and was delighted to add it to my collection. Great value for the money. You can see the early genius of Sally Field in this. Great comic timing and a lot of fun.
5,Gidget,I was 14 years old when Gidget was on tv. I hadn't seen it more than 40 years ago. Great to see once again.
4,Gidget TV,"Gidget is the best, back when life was simple, this is pure goodness, surfin, cars, deep fil-os-a-fee from Gidget, hanging out at the malt shop, not a care in the world, what's not to like."
1,Couldn't wait to end it.,I read about this period and Vietnam in particular as I'm a product of those times. I found this book lacking in so many ways. I read it out of respect but the author needs a lot of help or better help to bring the story of his experience to me in a way that I can understand what he wanted me to know and understand.
4,Very Entertaining,"I found this book to be well written and hard to put down. Having served in the military in 1967- 1968 I have friends who served as members within Navy Seal units and know how dedicated these men are to this country. This book does a great job in describing their intense training, deployment & combat experiences. Thank you all for your service. Would highly recommend this book, well done."
2,Not worth the money,"While I am grateful that we have people totally insane to do what these people do I had a tough time getting through this book without constantly rolling my eyes. I bought the Kindle edition hoping for a great read but instead I got a 17 page description of a foot race between the author and his buddies. 17 pages describing a foot race put me in a coma for awhile. Also, murmuring sweet nothings to a shotgun named ""sweetlips"" and harboring a python snake under his cot seemed a little much. Then again, anyone willing to lay down in leeach filled bug infested filthy mud and water for hours on end just to kill one or two VC without ever mentioning trench foot or jungle rot once, is amazing in itself. Good try but not worth the money."
3,"Very descriptive, but also very repetitive","The book was very good and descriptive, almost too descriptive in some parts, but it was also very repetitive. I really got tired of reading about overnight ambushes! All the missions described in the book, except a mere 1, was part of an overnight ambush. Very well written though."
5,a great book for anyone to read,"Missile Master is the story of a handful of hilarious MP's stationed at a quiet army base somewhere in middle America. Either they're on duty or chasing after girls, often both are performed simutaneously. Their paramours include the two staff secretaries, the Colonel's teenage daughter, and even the Colonel's wife! This happy-go-lucky lifestyle is interrupted when someone decides to test the base's security by planting fake explosives. Now everyone must unite to save the Colonel's reputation from slander. After a string of unforgettable adventures, the gang is successful. The Colonel retires in honor. The MP's mull around for awhile before being shipped off. The ending is a tragic-poetic shocker. Kirts' touching, intelligent philosophy about life is expressed in Missile Master perhaps better than anywhere else."
4,good good good,"exceptionaly good mathy rock and roll with a metal slant (which, in all honesty, would probably not appeal to most metalheads). these songs draw out alot of frustrated knotty chords and weird time signatures but all is pulled off with class and a slight smirk. the production is lean and crisp and there's actually quite a few melodic lines that get stuck in your head. an influential band/record and one of the reasons for the outbreak of so many sub standard ""math rock"" bands in later years after it's release. ugh. at least Breadwinner didn't forget to write songs. a recommended cd."
3,the light keepers daugter,"The Light Keepers DaughterThis book was strange but really interesting. At first I thought that the book was bad but as soon as I kept on reading, it started to get a lot better. The book has a lot of twisted and turns in it. Although squid loves her dad she blames him for everything that happens, like her brother dying. I like this book cause it was different. Not every book is about islands and light keepers. This girl that is the main character is so much like anything, or me, that I wish that I never had to go home like that. She is always having fun and running around. I really like it and would recommend this to anyone who likes fun fictional books. One thing I didn't like was how they would talk about how the past was, and then they would talk about the future bounce back and forth between the past and future and sometimes they would lose me. It talked about people in the third person a lot which was kind also of confusing."
5,Very well done,My wife and I suddenly lost one of our sons in late 2011. This book nailed the feelings of a parent as they process what happens when you find out and beyond. I commend how Bill dealt with his grief. His cross-country bike trip did so many good things for Bill and his family.
5,Inspirational Book!!!,"This is one of the most inspirational books I have ever read--in part b/c it was not written to be that. Bill Hancock's message is so simple...appreciate life. Appreciate the good times because they are good. Appreciate the bad times, because they alone can help you realize the good, and both are part of who you are. He should be commended for his tenacity to stay the course, both his journey in life and cross country biking!! I wish I could thank him in person for sharing his story."
1,Disgusted by this homophobia,Upholding the right to free speech does not extend to promoting the abuse of gay people. The overtly aggressive nature of the homophobia in the lyrics of this artist are tantamout to the advocation of violence against gay people and should not be encouraged. If similar action were taken towards black people they would be withdrawn immediately. (...)
4,Less Messy Than Regular Bar Soap. Fun To Use,"The idea for a foaming soap is to reduce the time it takes for washing your hands. Instead of trying to work on a lather, a foaming soap is already made up of soap suds. Foaming liquid soap is generally thinner and watery, or else it will clog the mechanism to produce suds. You can buy refills in bigger containers. Or some people are successful in mixing water and other liquid soap.Dial makes a lot of foaming soap products including Tone. A 7.5 oz bottle lasts a long time. More convenient than a regular soap for your powder room and sinks. It is also less messy than regular soaps. Generally one pump is enough to cover both hands. Just make sure that you cup your hands or the soap will spurt across the room. One wrong pump is all that it takes to learn how to use a foaming soap dispenser."
3,Doesn't work with ipod video,"I like the idea, but the jack is in the wrong place for my ipod video. Had to return it. Wish that the info on this was more complete."
3,Hold feature is terribly flawed,"I was excited about picking this device up, but ran into a major problem in actually using it. The ""hold"" button on the device does NOT put a hold on the iPod itself, only on the device. And if you toggle on the hold button on the iPod, the device doesn't work.So basically if you have your iPod in a pouch or on a belt case, and want to use the buttons to now have to look at the side or take it out of the case, you can - but only if there's no risk with that setup of having the iPod spin wheel or buttons (depending on gen 3 or gen 4) get pushed.Great idea, bad implementation."
3,this is a nice addition to ipod accessories...,"...but i missed the part where it said, ""not compatible with ipod video"".i thought it wouldn't matter even if it would look weird because it would be off-center since i always use my ipod and risking of breaking the ipod clickwheel.my problem was that there is this connector that is protruding next to the plug, and no matter what position i tried, the plug wouldn't go in the earphone hole.so if you have a video ipod, i woulnd't recommend this, as the seller noted, which i totally missed... my fault!"
2,What were they thinking...,"...when they cut out the instrumental portion of ""Angry Eyes""? I was furious when I discovered that fact after buying the CD ( I got it before reading the reviews here). Yeah, yeah, some of their other nuggets like ""Vahevala"" are here, but messing up ""Angry Eyes"" totally tripped me out. Save your money unless you have no use for ""Angry Eyes"" but if you ask me (well, you didn't, but I'll say it anyway), that's the magnum opus of this band."
3,Too Short,"This is nice introduction to Loggins and Messina, but it is far too skimpy to purchase. I find no Loggins and Messina album truly excellent, but I do believe that the duo produced 15-18, even 20 songs that should be on a single disc Best of CD. 'Listen to a Country Song' from the first LP is but one song that should be added to this meagre 10 song CD. Certainly another song or two from Mother Lode belongs. In addition, the full length album cuts should be used rather than the shortened vinyl singles edits."
2,And the attempt is... SHORT!,"The ""Best of Friends"" contains only ten tracks, and less than fourty minutes of music. That would be acceptable, except for the fact that ""Angry Eyes"", one of Loggins and Messina's biggest hits, has been chopped from six minutes, to 2:23. Initially, this collection may have been released on vinyl, which would explain the shortened version, but there's plenty of room on the CD for the complete version, with room to spare for more tunes! So,where's the rest of it? This is a ""Greatest Hits"" collection, isn't it?My humble opinion? It's unfortunate that Columbia released this ""short"" CD, although some may think I'm nitpicking. If you never cared for the instrumental in ""Angry Eyes"", and you enjoy Loggins and Messina, you'll enjoy this CD. However, if you remember ""Angry Eyes"" in the spirit of which it was intended... Save your money!"
2,Don't waste your money....,L&M were so much more than what this represents....and I won't even discuss the Angry Eyes issue. L&M were also more than a pop/radio group that I have seen mentioned here. They had many songs which featured more of a jazz feel. I would highly recommend you only buy their studio releases as there were not that many. A greatest hits release just does not do them justice.
1,Pretentious pap,"From the album notes it's apparent Delta 72 fancy themselves as some kind of breakthrough act, returning rock to its rhythm and blues roots. In reality they are a bunch of poseurs hacking a ballsless, humorless mush out of some spare R&B parts that were lying around. If it's white boys doing R&B you crave, check out The Contortions."
5,"A heartwarming, charming story","When Paige Ashton finds herself on the auction block at the charity bachelorette auction that she herself had organized, she never imagined that she would end up being ""bought"" by Walker Camberlane, one of the most handsome men on the face of the earth. Their date propels the two to embark on a business relationship that promises to benefit both of them, only to have it compromised by a single act of passion. While they both want a deeper, more intimate relationship, there are obstacles in their way.Roxanne St. Claire has written a touching, tender, heartwarming book with characters that fully compliment each other. I have yet to read a book by Ms. St. Claire that I haven't loved, and I give The Highest Bidder a high recommendation."
3,typical romance novel by a beginner,"This was a quick easy read. The main characters were fleshed out but everyone else was flat. There was a ""murder mystery"" that im supposing was to serve as a way for the leads to get to know each other. FYI the murder is never solved. I hope the author rewrites this book because I believe it could be a lot better."
1,Amateurs...,"Don't by this album if you want to hear music from an accomplished band. This stuff is total poop. There's a reason why hardly anyone has heard of them. If you were hoping to hear something with unorthadox song structures, stranage rhythms or experimental tunings you'll find it here, only it sounds like it was thrown together by 12 year olds. A better purchase in the same genre would be Feels by Animal Collective."
5,Polvo's Best,"Easily Polvo's greatest work, from the unconventional, noisy guitar work to the mumbly vocals, damn near everything about this album is perfect."
3,I like Polvo so this is hard to write,"I do feel this album is (like a previous reviewer wrote) a bit under-rehearsed. Still very good, but not the apex of Polvo that spoiled fans (like me) who've heard ""Celebrate The New Dark Age"" or ""This Eclipse"" have been conditioned to expect."
2,Indie without Intelligence,"Noisy, jarring guitar-work that tries to sound edgier and grittier then the extent of its vocabulary suggests and ends up wallowing in various influential audio muck as the band tries on different distorted and compositionally weak approaches for size."
4,Pooperific!,"This product is basically tasteless and easy to eat. I even kind of like the texture. If you mix it with water and weight it will turn into a kind of gel. It does have some tiny little leaves or something in it, but that seems harmless.It works very well. Keeps you regular. It really eases IBS or hemmorhoids. Makes you feel full. Supposedly helps cut cholesterol and boost your immunity. Reduces your risk of cancer.The best part about the whole psyllium husk is that it seems safer than the powdered stuff. I've gotten some really bad cramps and rock hard doodie from the powdered stuff. You have to be really careful to get LOTS of water with that stuff. The whole husk doesn't seem to cause that problem for some reason. Even if I take a lot larger dose."
5,Cut to the chase,"If you are buying a psyllium product, it is for fiber and regularity. So, these whole psyllium husks will get you there faster and more perfectly. OK, so they are not as convenient to take as the capsules or the no-grit fiber powders- but this product makes those other products seem like fakes. It is the real deal."
2,IS NOT ORGANIC !,"FALSE ADVERTISING - The picture shows a a product labled ""Certified Organic"", the product that arrives isn't. It's the same brand but without organic certification. Organic isn't mentioned anywhere on the label of the product that arrives. FALSE ADVERTISING :("
1,can we say awful..........,can we say awful..........Psyllium Husks Whole Vegetarian 24 Ounces.......supposed to be healthy but you can not hide or disguise this stuff in anything...Threw away...wasted my money.....yuk!~
2,1Lb bag- 2 words- BAD GAS,"I purchased the 1 lb bag, as it was slightly better priced than the 12oz cannister I had previously purchased, but this just wasn't the product for me.On the other hand, I got the 12 oz cannister and had much different results. It worked as it should have, and I was able to leave the house and go venture out in public, without fear of small crowded spaces..I drink plenty of water when I use this product, so not sure what the difference is, but I would say allergic reaction to the product in the 1 lb bag. Tossed it. Just my experience."
5,Better than any name brands!,This is a great product. No fillers like the big name products for a much lower price.
4,Good Book,"I thought this was a good book, however it is very dense with the theory and can be hard to swallow."
5,Reddys book,A very good and comprehensive book for composite engineers looking for analytical solutions. Bending Buckling and Vibrations of composite shells are very well explained.
1,HATED IT!,"The WORST chick lit I have read, ever! And I have read a lot of them. I thought I would be the target audience for this book, the Bachelor is my favorite TV show, and 95% of my pleasure reads are chick lit, but I could not wait to finish the book....so I could throw it out! The characters were too stereotypical to be believable and lacked depth. The author tried so hard to make Sarah's problems and inner conflicts deep that the situations were painstakingly drawn out and then resolved with a simple thought. And the show Sarah is participating in is full of things that would never happen on a reality television show, from a technical aspect. (i.e. interaction with producers, camera men) I would never, ever want any of my friends to read this book!"
4,A good time,"This book was a good time - quick to get into, quick to read, and an entertaining story. Although it sounds like a behind the scenes look at the now over-exposed reality dating shows, it's really about the main character, who isn't a single woman at all. Even if you don't like reality shows, the story and writing manages to keep your attention because Sarah is funny, sarcastic, and grappling with her own issues that have nothing to do with reality TV and everything to do with real life."
3,The Bachelor,"This storyline was drawn 99.9% from The Bachelor television series. The twist with this story is that one of the 25 women selected is a 'plant,' and she's actually a marriedinvestigative reporter (with a child). The writing was good, but there is no originality in terms of the storyline. It was a complete Bachelor takeoff; the book is ok to read if you're a die-hard Bachelor fan, but basically, if you've seen the show you don't need to read this book. The only difference between this book and the actual series is that The Bachelor on tv gives away roses and this bachelor lights a candle."
4,"Cute, but a little cheesy","I picked up this book and read it in two days. It was definitely one of those books where you can wait to find out what is going to happen next. However, it was a little cheesy at times and had some bad language. This is an especially enjoyable read for those who are into ""The Bachelor"" tv show."
4,A Great Book!,Jennifer O'Connell's first book was a great hit. Definitely would recommend buying and then looking for her next book. A great summer book to bring to the beach or just lay around the house. I couldn't put it down and from page 1 to the last page continued to laugh and feel part of the book. It makes you think twice about all those reality dating shows and what might be going on behind the scenes.
3,Had its moments but...,"This book had it's moments but I found the writing a little dry for much of it. I guess it didn't hook me as much toward the middle and through to the end as it did in the beginning. I also didn't believe that the guy on this reality show would truley be ""so freaking nice"" as the author kept telling me. But overall it wasn't a terrible way to spend a few afternoons. Perhaps I will pick up another by this author and give that a try."
5,Can't beat it for great chick lit,"Take a woman who knows she's older, thinks she's wiser, and send her on assignment to write an article about how horrible reality dating shows are, and you're in for a great time! This book hooked me with its wonderful main character, who is smart, funny, sarcastic, and still ends up making mistakes that keep her realistic. The other women were all different, the dates funnier and funnier, and the plot never stood still. I especially enjoyed the ending, which brought the story and character back to real life to deal with the fallout from her actions. I'd highly recommend this book and am off to read the author's second one."
4,Reality Tv,I liked this book for being a quick read. I enjoy some of the reality shows because the people on them can be so superficial and silly just like some of the characters in this book. I recommend it because it can be a quick beach summer read.
5,A Must Read....I Can't Stop Talking About It!,"As Jennifer O'Connell's first publishing, I was impressed with her ability to keep me on the edge of my seat for the entire book! I was amazed at how I was actually starting to believe this was a ""real behind the scenes"" story...It's that captivating! This would make a great Chick Flick! One element of the book's plot that I love the most is how Sarah and her husband rekindle the spark that brought them together in the first place which was somehow lost through focusing on their careers and raising a child."
3,Funny book; not much of a murder mystery,"ONE DEAD DIVA abounds with gay comic one-liners. I found myself cackling aloud, especially near the beginning of the novel. As a murder mystery, though, the novel is lacking in several areas--not enough dead bodies, not enough red herrings, clues, or wrong turns. The author simply lets the murderer reveal himself at the end. It's a light read, rather fun. But the plot doesn't build momentum. I kept putting the book aside every couple of chapters."
3,Bought for mom...,"I can only say that regarding this book I bought it for my mother, whom is well educated and she found it to be a challenging read.I purchased it based on the recomendation of a professor I was friends with, probably where I went wrong. I think conseptually it was a solid book based on the feedback I received, it was just challenging."
5,"Hilarious, and beautifully written.",I recommend this book to all people with a sense of humor. It isn't a dry sociological document. The author takes great pleasure in writing about the subject and manages to be tongue in cheek without sounding elitist. A little good kitsch is good for you!
4,A cold friendship,"I very much recommend this book, it was a great story that kept me thriving for more. I could not put this book down whenever I picked it up. When I read the book I could easily concentrate, I almost got sucked into the story and became one of the characters in it. I learned that scurvy is a sickness that can kill, I learned this from when John died. I loved the book because it is non fiction and I actually know that ithappened. John and Lukes friendship held my interest because when John got sick Luke visited him almost every day. Alot of people would enjoy it. Anyone interested in survival, large ships, Arctic weather, a great friendship, and a mystery of a missing ship. I would read one billion other books by these two authors I love the story. I encourage anyone that can get this book to read it. BURIED IN ICE IS A GREAT STORY BY A GREAT AUTHOR..."
2,Good - but a bit contrived,"While the first part of the book discussing the history of the Franklin Expedition was both interesting and informative, the remainder of the book seemed padded and contrived, as it dwelled too much on the modern day trials and tribulations of Beattie and his collaborators. The authors seemed to be trying too hard to build up to a climatic conclusion, and I felt that the book could have been much better written."
4,Buried In Ice,"excellent primer for understanding the journey and risk of the arctic explorers. can you imagine what physical and mental changes these folks went through due to the lead poisoning? this book brought home the risks of sailing the arctic, getting stranded and ice bound, sometimes for two years, and solving the mystery years later by the authors. Nice read - not too much detail on the nuts and bolts of anthropology or archaeology. Hope they find more in the future. For the price, you won't be disappointed."
3,scared s---tless,"My mother gave this book to me when I was ten, which was a very long time ago. Those images of the mummies, so well-preserved that they don't look like mummies but like still-living human beings in some eternal pain we can't imagine -- they gave me nightmares then and they can still chill me to the stomach."
3,Not their best,"I'm a huge Polvo fan, but this album is a disappointment. It's not surprising they broke up after its release, their hearts just don't seem in it anymore."
4,Perfect addition!,This is a great outfit. Perfect addition to any Snap N Style doll set. All are durable and fun. Perfect for toddlers.
4,Adult school use,"This book is good for building basic vocabulary in German. It is basically a coloring book, but it would be nice to have a version with darker ink, so my senior students could read it better. Some of the pictures are obviously generic and do not exactly match German culture. Still, it's a good source, where there's no over-kill in vocabulary."
2,German picture word book,I was disappointed in this book because it didn't attach the word to the picture. Sometimes it was difficult to decide what the word was describing.
3,Coloring Book,"This book has a ton of pictures and words, but it's a little busy. I also didn't realize it was a COLORING book. I was looking for pages a little less cluttered and colorful as I got it for my toddler. Better for older children."
1,Never Last More than a Year,I've had three and none has lasted much more than a year. I'm going to try a mag drive pump next.
1,Pump failed within 1 year.,"As the previous reviewer noted, my Cal PW3500 lasted just about a year. The seal failed allowing water to enter and tripped my GFI circuit. This is very unfortunate because this pump performs very well for the cost and provides a steady flow of water. Buyer beware."
1,incorrect order,I have not used this pump due to the fact it is not the same as the photo. The intake is not the same. It is the same as GPH of 3500. Not the same as the photo.check before you order. Looks like they are shipping older pumps and showing phones of new.Will not use they again
4,"LOUSY TOMBRAIDER MIX, EXCELLENT OTHER MIXES","The Tomb Raider mix familiar to most is less bouncey and more industrial thanks to former NIN guy Charlie Clouser, and is not really my cup of tea. Much more fascinating are a sort of arabic hiphop version that anyone who has seen U2 live recently will be familiar with, and an evil hiphop turn on the Quincey and Sonace mix."
4,Influx Baby!,"The influx remix of elevation is better than anything on their new album (save for In a Little While). It makes one yearn that they returned to their more experimental 90's music, instead of dishing out cold leftovers on their new album."
5,Harmony Found!,"As Pogo once said, ""We have found the enemy and it is us"". Well, we have found the harmony and it is Na Leo. Beautiful music by lovely ladies."
2,I would look to buy a different product....,"The quality of the tutorial was not great. It was slow, did not allow for rewind (only forward or restart), only video - no interaction as in most computer based training, and was significantly overpriced compared to other products on the market. I would look to buy a different product.Review supplied by Benelife on behalf of a Buyer"
3,Used Book,"Product is in ok condition. It is used, but then that is what I ordered. No problem with the shipper"
4,The American School,"This book was used in my masters class -- it is not your typical textbook -- in that it includes the author's opinions about educational history in America. It is well written and Spring has some opinions that can incite the reader to action and others that the reader will ""just go along with"". For lovers of history -- it is a good read. For those interested in the educational foundations of America, it is a good read."
1,Predictable and Bland,"I was forced to read this book as the main text for a graduate level class in education, and I wish that I had dropped the course. Spring's version of the history of the American education system became tiresome and bland within the first fifty pages of the book."
5,great book purchase,the book came in a timely manner- was in great condition- and surved its purpose well! thanks.
5,The most lucid text on Abstract Algebra that I have seen.,"I used this book as the textbook for an undergraduate course in Abstract Algebra. It is very concise, clear and informative. The coverage of topics is very comprehensive, covering all that is needed at this level. The book makes the material fascinating, compelling and easily understandable. The exercises at the end of each chapter are at the right level of difficulty and help to elucidate the subject matter. This book is the ideal starting point for anyone with an interest in Abstract Algebra. Highly reccommended."
2,Didn't Work,"If you already have an infestation this doesn't help. It may help prevent one, I don't know, but won't help get rid of one. We combined this with washing, diatomaceous earth, and vacuuming to no avail. What ended up working was a combination of Little City Dogs brand Lufenuron and a dose of the same brand Nitenpyram. That combined with washing and vacuuming got rid of a several month flea infestation."
2,NOT VERY EFFECTIVE,Just killed six fleas that were on my dog despite the use ofFrontline Plus and a product containing rosemary and cedar oils. The herbal spray does not seem to be every effective.
4,"Smells pleasant, applies itself","I know my review is not really all that useful, but here goes...My package arrived sopping wet and smelling of eucalyptus and lemon or something. The bottle had busted open during shipping and all the contents had drained out before it got to me. It does smell nice, and my cats rolled around in the packaging, reacting to the smell similarly to how they react to catnip. My cats now have a pleasing herbal smell, and seem to be high as a kite."
1,Does NOT work!,I ordered this product when I found a few fleas on my cat. It does not work at all. I spray him every other day and spray right on the fleas and they are still living. It does not work don't waste your money.
3,1 outta 2 ain't bad...,It is a good thing I bought 2 of these. The first one died and would not receive from the outside transmitter.. The second one is working as far as I can tell..
5,economical,"book was like new condition and great price, content just as good as newer version for shool, great for college student on a budget"
3,nothing special,Delivery was a bit slow. Specifically choose IL thought it is closer to Virginia. But took a lot longer than expected. Condition of the book was not as good as it said but still Ok.
1,Awful!!!!!!!!!!,"Please do not/not waste your money on this toothbrush. It is the most ridiculously expensive toothbrush ever! For the price, I had thought that it was an electric one, no!!! it is a regular toothbrush. My fault for not reading carefully."
4,"A gentle ramble through history with one or two ""gems""","I read the book and loved it!I liked the gentle ramblings into details of history etc and the side stories the author goes into. It was more like taking an informative nature-trail stroll on a Sunday afternoon, rather than a route-march to a destination.The title is a bit misleading but the author does explain the historical take on what a ""mystery"" is. All in all I liked it."
4,The truth that can set us free.,"Bell Hooks' book speaks the kind of truth that we all need if we are ever to move beyond racism. Through her book, she reminds us of one basic truth that I have long beleived: peace is possible, but it has to come from within. If you like this book, I also highly recommend the book, Peace Be Still: Inner Healing for Racial Harmony, also available on Amazon.com."
1,Absolute nonsense,"Amazon.com must be practicing censorship. This is the second time I've posted a review of this rambling book of nonsense, yet my first went unprinted.bell hooks, like her other leftist counterparts (Cornel West, Michael Eric Dyson, etc. ad nauseum), are hypocrites in the worst way. These believers in the faith of socialism obviously have no problem living high off the hog of capitalism through their well-paid speaking engagements and advances for their books. Yet they all have the audacity to proselytize weak minds in socialist dogma.Go figure.I wish Amazon had a negative star rating."
1,Not a boxed set,Watch out! I thought this would be a boxed set with extras. It is just the six seasons shrink-wrapped together. You can buy them individually for much less!
3,Be Sure to Check Them,"I just have one problem with this selection. When I went to watch season 2 although the first disc was labeled disc 1 the data on it was identical to that of disc 2. In a nutshell, the disc was mislabeled and so lucky me, I got 2 disc 2's and no disc 1. As the packaging on these seasons were the original manufacturer wrappers, I don't know if this just got by quality control or what. My advice is to check all the discs before your 30 day return window is up."
5,Awesome show!!!,"Everything went smooth got the dvds 2 days after I ordered them. This is my favorite show of all time I got the dvds on sale for 80 bucks, I'm not sure how much they cost now. Regardless, you wont regret this purchase, well worth it."
3,Broken disc,"Everything is great came on time, just one disc is broken. Which is such a shame. Thank you anyways though."
2,fresh prince of bel air complete box set,"My over all satisfaction is poor. The set was packaged nicely but season 2 is all messed up the discs are labeled wrong,two discs have the same episodes on them, and 4 episodes are missing. While the rest of the set is correct the one season that is mot right upsets me to no end."
3,Missing episodes,"I love this show! I was a little disappointed when Season 1 & 2 were missing episodes. The season 2 disc 1 & 2 were both disc 1 and for some reason episodes were skipped in Season 1, I don't really know why. No problems with any other season."
5,movies,This was what my grandson asked for as his Christmas present from me and he loves it. It was a little expensive but well worth it.
5,Very good condition,What a great price and they came in near perfect condition. I have only caught bits and pieces of this show through the years so it's fun to be able to go back and watch it in order and see where some of these stars came from.
4,"Accurate, easy read","The books greatly describes the rigors of US Marine boot camp. I am a Lance Corporal in the Marine Corps and have been in for about a year, so I can tell you this book is up to date and accurate. This is another book I read prior to joining and it motivated me. I would recommend this anyone interested in learning what the recruits go through to earn the title of United States Marine. Robert_Ticehurst@Scudder.com if you want more comments on the Marine Corps or books."
5,Great piece of work,This book was very informative and I would recommend it to anyone considering joing the Marine Corps. I gives an in depth look at each obstacle and a brief history on why it was named that and who it was named after. Gret book to read.
2,Into the Crucible Kindle review,"Great book, but there was as least 1 typo on every page. I really felt like nobody read through this before releasing it... being that the word ""Marines"" was written ""Mannes"" more than once. I understand that these books are most likely scanned into the system..... but please, at least have someone read over them before you charge 11.99."
5,Great insight and information,"I am a Captain on Active Duty and also a former platoon-mate of Captain Woulfe's at The Basic School. A great book about what boot camp has become and some of the principles behind Marine Corps Recruit Training. A must read for marines, everywhere, to see where the Corps has been, where it is now, and where it's going."
1,Protestant Propaganda Don't Be Fooled,"This author takes advantage of the name of a well known Catholic, Mel Gibson in an effort to sell his book. This book is an anti-Catholic publication. The only reference or mention of Mel Gibson is the ""Affirmation"" from Mel that was undoubtedly taken out of context and placed prominently on the front cover along with his name in bold print where the author's name would normally be. Don't be fooled."
1,Negative and poorly written!,Please do not read this book if you ever plan to adopt. I was very depressed and frustrated after reading this book. According to this book the only good age to adopt is an ifant. Apparently they don't believe other children deserve a home too. I'm glad I was well informed by real professional and good friends who have adopted before I read this book. Please do not read this RUN! Toddlers deserve a loving home too!
5,This is a MUST for all parents considering toddler adoption!,"The book is a very compassionate look at both toddlers in need of stable, permanent homes and the parents who adopt these wonderful kids. It tackles all aspects of both the problems these families face, as well as the joys, in a down-to-earth, easy to understand way. I read the book in 3 days, and loved it enough to read it again. I know that as my son grows and flourishes, I will owe part of his success, as well as a part of mine as a parent, to this book."
2,Discouraging but some helpful information...some not,"While there is some helpful information in this book, it is full of horror stories. It is especially discouraging to single parents, who only warrant a page of discussion. While it is true that attachment problems are especially common in kids adopted over the age of one, this book paints an especially bleak picture. I much preferred ""Parenting Your Internationally Adopted Child,"" which addresses attachment and despite the title, also has helpful strategies for domestic adoptive parents where the family background is sketchy. This book is dated, and future revisions would benefit from the removal of holding and reparenting strategies, which have been proved harmful."
3,Don't let this scare you away,"Being the mom of a son who was adopted as a toddler I can tell you that not all toddlers adopted at this age have such incredible attachment problems, emotional outbursts, etc. I personally believe this book had led to many toddlers not being adopted. This is not to say that problems can exist, but attachment problems occur in babies as well. For those parents who are looking for answers on how to deal with a toddler with attachment issues this might be the book that will help you. If you are a prospective parent of a toddler, realize that there are many, many children adopted as toddlers who come home without the severe problems this book focuses on."
4,"Helpful, informative book","Rather than find this book negative, I find it realistic and informative. Toddler adoption is not for people who wish they adopted an infant. This is the message of this book. It does share some of the problems one might come across when adopting a child, tantrums, attachment issues, etc. However, it consistently gives a hopeful positive message. The realities of adopting a toddler are included as well as the joys of adopting a toddler. I believe that those who find this book negative are expecting that there will be no inherent problems in adopting a child whom you are taking away from the only home they have known at one year old or more. They are wrong."
5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book for parents who are considering adoption or who are waiting for their referral. This book does a great job of preparing parents for some of the possible issues they may face, without scaring you out of the idea of adoption!! I felt much better prepared for my daughter after reading this book."
4,"good, but watch out...","This is a great book, but pretty heavy on the ""horror stories"". We were so convinced by the horror stories that we pressed for a non-trivial amount of transition time with the birth mother, and she thought we were being too much of a pain and dumped us :-("
4,Great but squeeky!,I cannot believe the value and versatility of this equipment. I am so happy I purchased from Amazon as the value with the stand is awesome!! And I love the workout(s)! It took about 15 minutes to set up. I do notice a lot of sqeeking... it is the stand but it isn't anything I would return this equipment over!
5,Great piece of equipment!,"This is a good sturdy quality piece of equipment. I was afraid it might not be stable and function like some of the larger or more expensive reformers. This definitely holds it's own and I'm glad I got this one because I can keep it by the wall and then easily slide it over for the workout. All of the parts work smoothly. As far as the trampoline in the lying down position, I need to start slowly or I get a little nauseous. Most importantly, I have a herniated disc in my center back and the Pilates exercises are helping me enormously. I highly recommend it."
3,item tailored to tall people,"I am 5 feet 1 inches tall and this machine is too long for me. I could'nt get the bend in my knees that is needed, or a big jump on the springboard. I could have put pillows or rolled up towels at my shoulders, but for this much money i want it to work correctly. The footbar should be adjustable or at least bent in so that shorter people would fit properly, that would have helped a lot!"
1,Missing parts,"I was really looking forward to getting this put together today since it was the first day my husband was able to help. Unfortunately the connection bars are missing, too late to call Stamina...very frustrated. I'm wondering who does the packaging on these items, how could something like this not be put in...so now I have to call tomorrow and then wait until I have the benefit of using this. The reason I bought off of this site verses another company is because their reviews had a lot of people that wrote in to say how some key components were missing. I hope to be able to rewrite this review once I see how long it takes to get the other parts here, until then, very unhappy with Stamina and Amazon since they should double check what they send out."
2,Workout DVD's Don't Work,"Very solid and fairly easy to assemble. But... once I got it assembled I tried to watch the two supplied DVD's ( Level 1 Workout & Cardio Workout).. neither of them would play in ANY DVD Player. Really needs these to fully understand how to use the damn thing. Yes, there is a wall chart with pictures.. but really need the video's to really understand how to use it safely. Very disappointed to spend this much money and get poor quality DVD's that won't play. Called Stamina for replacements, seems like they know there is a problem, and they said would send replacements. We'll see..."
2,Disappointing,"IMHO ""Beautiful Noise"" (the album) is Neil Diamond's masterpiece. As a general rule his live performances have much more grit and energy than his slightly too slick studio albums. So to get a live album featuring no less than 6 tracks from his greatest album, and with production once more from Robbie Robertson sounded like an excellent idea. Unfortunately, whether it's in the mastering or the performances themselves, this is a very dull CD. Performances of ""Glory Road"" and ""Holly Holy"" really stand out, but that's not enough to save the album from mediocrity.When I first played this album my mother commented that she'd seen and loved the TV special when it aired all those years ago, so I suspect the fault cannot lie with Neil - hopefully we'll get to see it on DVD one of these days and find out for sure.In the meantime, if you want Neil live on CD stick with ""Gold"" and ""Hot August Night""."
5,Love at the Greek,Have loved this album for over thity years. It's positively his best music performed at the pinnacle of his career. Love his music.
4,Classic Diamond,"I have been a fan of Neil's as long as he has been performing. This CD while not on the level of the classic ""Hot August Night"" it still has moments when the diamond shines."
1,Why no Seagull on MP3,"I was excited to see Love at the Greek on MP3, but disappointed to see it didn't include the Jonathon Livingston Seagull suite, which would have been a major reason I'd buy the digital version of the album. Then I read other reviews saying that two rather significant songs are left off of the CD as well. Neither of these omissions make any sense to me. So I won't be buying either digital version, as neither is complete.Who makes these arbitrary decisions anyway? Guess I'll have to pull out my old vinyl and buy a USB turntable if I want the entire show."
3,A Major Disappointment,"The was NDs first live album for Columbia Records. Its loosely based on the NBC Special. First of all not all the songs are on the album that were on the TV Special. Second of all when the album went from vinal to CD ""The Last Picasso and Longfellow Serenade"" were omitted. Performance wise, ND and the NDRRT are in good form. I love the Jonathan Livingston Seagull medley, and the Beautiful Noise songs. To do this album justice Columbia should find all the orignal songs, digitally remaster it with album artwork. Ala what MCA did for Hot August Night.Columbia dropped the ball on this album."
4,"Where's ""I am, I said""?","This concert was televised live - I remember watching it and making a crude recording of it when I was a child. By far the best performace of the show was the song ""I am I Said"", and to my knowledge this was cut from the original soundtrack and never included in any issue of this album. With the length constraints of old recording media no longer an issue, it is a mystery why this recording was never remastered and reissued with all material included. Overall, this is a great, high energy performance."
4,A very useful and instructive book,"This book is useful to help its reader to understand certain aspects of the gunpowder revolution, and it is particularly useful to point out the political effect of the change in military technology.The book does not give as much tactical detail as one might wish, but it is likely that anyone who wishes to study the subject seriously (and Parker's work is obviously intended for the serious reader)will have a copy of Delbruck, and that will give access to detailed descriptions of certain of the important tactical developments leading up to the introduction of massed gunpowder weapons."
3,A wrong turn along the way,"Finally, it seems that Asimov will bring his seminal Foudation Series to a conclusion. Edge starts out well by building on the other Foundation books. It's good to see a space adventure that seeks out both Earth and the final answers. But it is hard to imagine that Asimov would have taken the Gaia route if he had written this book immediately after he wrote Second Foundation. For that reason, the introduction of this philosophy at this point seems quite disingenuous."
1,Killed the best series ever,"Issac Asimov's Foundation trilogy is perhaps one of the best sci-fi series ever writtien, and the Foundation preludes are pretty good too. The best two books in the series are Fowrd the Foundation and Foundation. Asimove was clearly not inspired when he wrote this book, it destroys the Plan that has bee set up throughout the rest of the series. While the original trilogy deal with psychohistory ans its practicality, this simply tears it all down. The only plus that can be attributed to the book is that it does indeed keep one on his or her edge. Die hard Foundation fans would do better to reread Foundation, people who want to see the entire timeline of the ""Asimovian Universe"" tied up neatley should just read Prelude to Foundation. I for one was completely disillusioned with Asimov after this book, fortunately i had not yet read Foward the Foundation, a most readeaming book."
5,After the trilogy,"If you read the Foundation Trilogy and anxious about what happened next, get this book as well as Prelude to Foundation, Forward the Foundation, and Foundation and Earth. Also read the robot series connected to Foundation :The Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun, The Robots of Dawn, Robots and Empire."
3,Every step is bigger.,"The story makes an uncomfortable mash up of all things Asimov. It is only his ability as a writer that keeps it from flying off the rails. In short, if you like all things connected, go for it."
5,worthy sequel to the original trilogy,"it has been more than 10 years since i read this book and foundation and earth. as far as i can remember when i read this book, i immediately noticed that these books were written by a much mature hand than the ones which wrote the first three - asimov apparently wrote these two almost 20 years later. and afaicr i enjoyed these two more than its predecessors - i still remember the character gendiball. the comparison between hobbit and the lord of the rings with the original foundation trilogy and these two books would not be totally unjustified. these are much more complete and professionally written novels than the original foundation trilogy.btw one reviewer has compared gaia with the communist utopia. but such a comparison is totally off mark. gaia is the greek philosopher plato's spiritual vision of the universe. it is that which asimov clearly referred to.great reads - this and ""foundation and earth""."
5,One of the best sci-fi book series available,"Asimov's Foundation books are well-crafted, masterfully imagined, and peopled with fascinating characters. Spanning some several thousand years, and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book), the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory, a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people, and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles, intrigue, mutants, telepathy and mind control, as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels. They are, in my opinion, among the best crafted series in the sci-fi genre ever produced. Read them all, and try to read them in chronological order."
2,A disappointment,"This book would be interesting only if you have read the foundation trilogy and are just dying for more. Otherwise, this book is just an episodic bumbling from place to place. The previous books challenged the reader to imagine a world where a very sophisticated mathematical and social science could predict the course of humanity. However, Foundations Edge does not add anything significantly new, and the empire saga begins to feel tired"
3,Not The Best Foundation Book,"After the Mule (Books 2 and 3), the rest of the Foundation books just kind of tale off and fizzle."
4,Forging a New Path,"In a continuation of the by now immortalized Foundation series, Asimov builds the conflict between the two Foundations to an apocalyptic level. The scope and creativity of the novel is unmatched, and the strength of the characters is unquestionable. However, the end of the book diverges sharply from the precedent established in previous Foundation novels, and the change can be a little disillusioning for dedicated readers of the series. This abrupt change is part of what keeps the series interesting, but Asimov gives little reason for the new course."
3,Me/Myself/I enjoyed this book somewhat,This book was actually pretty good. Promising beginning and middle. Then out of nowhere comes Gaia (incrediabledumb idead) and in two seconds seldons plan is over. For thos e distraught with the ending read Foundation's Triumph
5,Worthy of the Foundation name,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It can stand alone as a book but it also links together with the Foundation Trilogy very well.I liked seeing that the Foundation still survived and that the Second Foundation are just as human as us with their petty differences and their selfish motives. This also makes me tend to agree to a third alternative.I can't reveal anything but I think the ending was pretty good. Some people seem to think the Seldon Plan will be destroyed but why should it? Hari Seldon only calls for the Plan to create the rise of the Second Galactic Empire. Anything that happens after that is fair play and I happen to think Seldon would want people to do things for themselves.All in all, I highly recommend this book and any other book with the name Foundation in it, especially Forward the Foundation if you haven't read it yet."
1,Starts off promising but betrays the original trilogy.,"I can't possibly say enough good things about the original trilogy. I thought that those books were incredible in their scope and aims. That's why I hate this book. Asimov starts it off great and he gets you interested. But by the end he has basically taken what made you love the original three books and thrown it out the airlock. I can't say anything more about what he does because that would constitute a spoiler. But be advised: if you like the original trilogy because of its over all plot, stay away from this book! You'll wonder how Mr. Asimov could do this to his own series. It probably deserves more than one star but because of the ending I just can't give it anything else."
5,Asimov's Fine Piece,"This story is the continuation of the foundation trilogy.The Story represent a incredible idea,fresh idea where science fiction become sort of reality. In fact the story line is superb.GET IT !"
2,Little Pump that Couldn't,"I have a Urn type fountain, and my old pump rated at 100 GPH just made the water trickle out the top, so I thought doubling the output would help. There is about a two foot climb from the submerged pump to the water outlet. This pump could barely make any water come out. On the positive side, it has a nice long heavy cord. I don't see how it could get a rating of 200 GPH."
5,FC,"I agree with the last reviewer. It is a crime that Say No More is the only Les CD available to the public. This CD, his second release, is an all-time classic. The guitar playing is top rate, as are the lyrics and music. I saw Dudek live a few times, once a part of DFK, and nobody played the guitar any better . . . and I am a fan of Rory Gallagher, Roy Buchanan, Nils Lofgren (sans the boss), Tommy Bolin, Santana, and so on."
4,a cLASSIC,I was so happy to see this album listed. I had originally bought it back in the 70's and loved it from the start. I sure hope CBS releases more of his albums.
5,AWESOME HIGH SPEED RHYTHYM AND BLUES!,"PROBABLY ONE OF THE FINEST UNKNOWN GUITAR PLAYERS FROM THE ERIC CLAPTON, JEFF BECK, CARLOS SANTANNA, DAVID GILMORE, ROBIN TROWER ERA! ONE TIME HUSBAND OF CHER AND TOTAL RIFF GOD! THIS ALBUM HAS BEEN A CROWD AND PARTY PLEASER FOR THE LAST 20 PLUS YEARS! LES, IF YOUR OUT THERE, PLEASE GET BACK TO THE RECORDING STUDIO!"
4,Dudek- The Silent Perfectionist,"Greetings-As some of the afore mentioned revues have said, this is long over due. Les Dudek showed the American rock listening crowd that funky,bluesy straight-ahead rock-n-roll with a southern twist could help your Friday night get out and party mode.A very under-rated artist with 4 lps under his belt,Les Dudek can definetly work his music into you and back out and leave you wondering "" WOW!! did I just hear what I thought I heard ?. So you 70's compiling record CEO's quit wondering if it's going to sell or not. Just Do It.Every musical artist deserves a second heyday in their career. Like us consumers say every now and then,""What ever happened to so and so? Who da man? DUDEK be the MAN. Buy ""Say No More"". It's all that's out there right now, but very much worth it.Take care,Big Behr"
4,A girl trying to fit in who is willing to risk her life!,"The Secret on Platform 13 by Eva Ibbotson, is a fun-filled story about a young girl, Odge, trying to fit in to her very unusual family who is willing to face any danger and take any risk to do so. The story takes place in a secret fantasy world where ogres and beasts are just normal everyday creatures living in the human world (not like what we live in). The kingdom is ruled under a king and queen who have recently just had a baby. But one day while out in the ""real world"" the Prince is snatched by an evil woman who becomes his new mother until the portal entering the ""real world"" opens up again nine years later. It is up to Odge and a team of unusual creatures to go back to the world and rescue the Prince and bring him back to their world where he belongs."
5,Magical Read,"The book Secret of Platform 13 is one of my favorite books. I love the authour, Eva Ibboston, so it's not really a surprise I love this one!Magical and funny, yet charming and witty, I would recommend this book to anyone!"
5,The Secret of Platform 13,"This is a great book. I guess you could say it's in the style of Harry Potter, but really it's the other way around. This came out a few years before and I loved it. It's not a complicated story, but it's cute and engaging. The characters are great because they're not all perfect and the story line is charming. The writing style is also incredibly engaging. I'd say much better than Harry Potter. Pick up this book and you'll be quite satisfied. :)"
4,A comparable book to Harry Potter,"The author writes this book with amazing details and elements. It is a comparable book to Harry Potter. It is about a ""Lost Continent's"" Prince kidnapped by humans. A wizard, hag, fay, and ogre, were sent to get him. Events turned out to be different..."
2,Not enough...,"I read Ibbotson's ""Island of the Aunts"" and loved that book, so I picked up ""Platform"" and eagerly read through it. I was, however, disappointed with the predictable storyline. The only saving point was that the ending didn't happen quite like I thought it would, but the prince was still the prince and everyone lived happily ever after, yadda yadda yadda. Borr-ring.My qualm with Ibbotson is that her characters fall into only two strict polar catagories: good guys who have no faults, and bad guys who everything about them is a fault. That's that. Black and white. With no variation whatsoever.My advice: read Harry Potter, anything by Diana Wynne Jones or Lloyd Alexander. I do not recommend this book."
3,Harry Potter Wanna-be,"It's a well writen book, and a good idea, but I think that maybe Ibbotson should have thought up her own idea. This important baby boy is told he is something that he didn't know about and they go threw magical doorways UNDER platform 9 3/4. All I can say is Harry Potter runs the magic in this world."
2,Un-Memorable,"This book is just, simply, not good. It in NO WAY compares with Harry Potter, which is basically my fave book. (I'm one of those stupidly obessed fans). Good books, in my opinion, stick out, and this one doesn't have much action, doesn't have good characters, there's not a lot of magic, no good descriptions, and was confusing at times. The antagonist wasn't even evil, and in my opinion fantasy antagonists HAVE to be evil, and the ""good"" characters weren't that good. Don't read this book; read Redwall or Harry Potter. You won't regret it."
5,If you want action...,"When a prince is kidnpped a search party that consisted of a hag named Odge,an ogre named Hans, a fey namedGerkintrude and a wizard named Cor are sent to rescue him from an evil kidnapper in less than two hours. If they don't make it back in time they won't get home again for 9 years.My opinion of this book is that it is hallariousand the bizzare characters come up with absurd plans. I think it is perfect for all ages and I reccomend it to everyone."
3,The Secret of Platform 13,"My Mom had just finished reading a book by Eva Ibbotson when my Grandparents sent me this one!I found this story to be a Cinderella type Harry Potter story.My three favorite characters were Ben (the kidnapped Prince), Odge (the hag) and Hans (the ogre). A sense of humor is important on a mission like this and I felt they all had great ones.It was a fantasy that was easy to read and follow.I have suggested it to a few friends... try it yourself."
3,Worth reading,"No, really, it's not as good as the Potter books. It doesn't have their depth or complexity of plot. I would bet, though, that Rowling had this in the back of her mind when she was writing the Sorceror's Stone -- there are too many similarities to be coincidental. Platform 13 is worth reading in its own right, though, and its hero, Ben, is NOT a Potter clone. If you are one of those kids (or a parent of one) whose reading really started with Rowling's books, this would be a good way to branch out and assure yourself that there are other good books out there."
3,Not the caliber of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series,"After reading Rowling's first two novels, I was looking to diversify. I found E. Ibbotson's series and decided to take a chance based on the cover endorsements.I read the book out loud with my family. We were patient and persistent and read the entire book. We were all disappointed. The story has more potential than is developed. The plot is very transparent from early on in the story. There is no clear, central character or personal conflict/resolution. There ARE lots of fantasy characters but the author often looses the thread of the story in frequent explanations of fantastic beings. She does manage a few exciting scenes but over all it was not a compelling or engaging story."
4,Not bad.,"This book is great for Harry Potter fans. It shows magical wizardry, mortal humans, ghosts, and other magical creatures of two worlds. This is a great book, with mystery and magic roled into one."
3,Lightweight fantasy for the elementary years,"Lightweight yet imaginative fantasy. A bit simplistic and predictable; nowhere near the richness of the Potter world (yes, I know this pre-dated Potter). But enjoyable reading outloud to/with the 7-9 year old set."
3,well...,"if you've read the harry potter books, this book really seems like a bore. it didn't really hold my attention, but i finished and throughout the novel i couldn't help but compare it to harry potter. the plot and ending is predictable, characters aren't that well developed, but the story does hold some originality to it. i give this book three stars because it's written fair enough...fair, that's the book, only average."
2,A Waste Of Anyone's Time. . . . .,"Eva Ibbotson has here written a rushed, monotonous, dull story. 'The Secret of Platform Thirteen' is what I call a ""wanna-be Harry Potter book"". A mask of magical, whim sical characters and setting shroud the truly boring and familar book. You've noticed I've given it two stars,how ever. After all, isn't the cover art just breathtaking?"
3,This book was boring and annoying but it was ok i guess.,his ook was ok. I thought it was boring at some points and u just didnt wat to read any farther. Its about a secret world and the prince is stolen when he was a baby. Rescuers are sent out to save him and get it back. I would not recomend this book.
5,A great read for magical mystery fans.,"Well, I finally found one of the sources for J.K. Rowlings wonderful Harry Potter series. This book is perfect for children between the ages of 6 and 16. Not only does it tell a beautiful story about misfits who are destined for greatness, but is loaded with humor and common sense."
4,Harry Potter Wannabe?Check the copyright dates!!!!,"A lot of the reviews of this book say that it's just a Harry Potter wannabe. NEWSFLASH!!!! This book came out 3 YEARS BEFORE SORCERER'S STONE!!!!! Check the copyright dates!! Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone came out in 1997, while Island of the Aunts came out in 1994. If anyone was copying anyone else, it was J.K. Rowling copying Eva Ibbotson. This is a wonderful book, by the way."
5,A delightful fantasy in the best of the British style!,"Desperate because you've read all the Harry Potter books? Try THE SECRET OF PLATFORM 13. This is the kind of charming, funny fantasy that the British seem to do so well."
3,"I Love Ibbotson, But Choose A Different One","This book has the wonderful, tongue-in-cheek humour characteristic of Eva Ibbotson,as well as the the lovable characters, magical adventures, and gentle moral message. It's a nice story, but the ""surprise"" ending can be figured out about a quarter of the way into the book by anyone old enough to read it and then it's just going through the motions of reading it to get to the resolution. Illustrations aren't a real big part of chapter books such as this, but these illustrations aren't very good and could just as well have been left out. I hate to say anything negative about the work of Ibbotson because she is so good and has written such fun stories but this one is definitely not my first choice and I recommend searching out her other titles first."
5,Great video,Best price for something I'll use all winter especially during the holiday season - friends loved it and wanted to know where I got it.
4,Classic R.E.O.,"They didn't do a fabulous job transferring it from analog to digital format...sounds a bit ""tinny""...too much treble. I just adjust the equalizer and crank it up. Great classics like Golden Country, Riding the Storm Out and 157 Riverside Ave. I'm very happy with this album. Just hearing Gary Richrath's snake charming guitar playing is more than enough reason to buy this one."
1,Really,"Any classic album like this that is butchered to make it fit on one CD, is a shame. if anything maybe material could have been added. 157 is edcited and Gary's guitar solo and Little Queenie are left off. This is BS. Either realease it as it was put out, or leave it alone entirely. Shame on you for this partial release!!!"
5,Prime 1970's Live Rock!,"There's not much I can say here that hasn't already been covered. However I have seen a lot of comments regarding the edits to the CD version and many incorrectly describe cuts to ""Flying Turkey Trot"" & ""157 Riverside Avenue"". These 2 songs are not edited and do appear on the CD exactly as they were on the original LP & tape releases. I believe many people are recalling the 12 min long live version of ""157..."" that appeared on the 1980 compilation ""A Decade Of Rock & Roll"" and are confusing that version with the one that actually appeared on ""Live - You Get What You Play For."" I was disappointed about the omission of ""Gary's Guitar Solo"" & ""Little Queenie"" and I even made my own double CD version of the album by splicing in those missing recordings from my original cassette of the album. The tape sounded good enough you can't even distinguish the difference between it and the CD and I'm able to 'experience' this classic album in it's original 2-record set glory."
5,Classic REO,"If you like REO before they started playing sappy pop ballads, this is for you. It is a live version of many of their popular songs. Every collectionof 70's-80's rock should have this CD."
2,Rip-Off,"I re-read the info for this CD and no where on the page does it say this is an abbreviated version of the original album. There are sample songs to hear but that feature is not always an indicator of all the songs on an album, just the ones that you can demo. I am completely pissed to be so ripped off. I'm thinking I'll return this. How the hell do you have a LIVE REO Speedwagon CD without ROLL WITH THE CHANGES?????"
2,Disappointed!,"This was one of my favorite albums, back when I still had them. I was too excited to see it on cd to bother with reading the reviews. If I had, I would have seen that it has been butchered! What possible reason could they have for cutting Little Queenie? This is a song that came alive only when heard live. It was a primary reason for wanting to put this disc in my collection. Then, to hear Flying Turkey Trot cut short and Gary's guitar solo neutered, made me feel completely ripped off! I can only blame myself for not checking the song list more closely and reading other reviews here first."
4,Not the way I remember it.,"I remember way back in the day when this album was released. I believe there are some cuts missing from this CD release. One in particular I remember is a cut titled: ""Gary's Guitar Solo"", it is not here. Too bad, it is a great guitar solo by Gary Richrath."
3,"This is not your father's ""REO:Live""","This CD is not a direct reproduction of the LP. This was originally a double album,that has been fit on a single CD. Among others, ""157 Riverside Avenue"", a classic live cut has been severely edited, removing what is, in my opinion, the best part of the entire album. If you are looking for the full version, blow the dust off your turntable and break out the vinyl."
2,Please make it right.,"This really makes me angry.They cut Little Queenie and Gary's Guitar Solo.157 Riverside Avenue, and Flying Turkey Trot are not complete.I guess if you never heard the LP (vinyl) you'd never know the difference.True REO fans are not buying it. I've had this abortion a couple of years now and I'm still steamed."
1,You do not get what you pay for,"This is what happens when you hand over an important decision to the wrong person. Disaster is the natural consequence. The guy who took editorial decisions in this CD, either never heard of (pre-commercial) REO or just doesn't give a damn about excellent music. Indeed, what this guy did should be illegal and I firmly believe that he should be punished. The old vinyl version is simply a masterpiece and this one is just a dismembered version. But it still has some value, I guess. As a torn and stained famous painting still has some value. Just be aware that, by buying this CD, you are really getting a torn and stained masterpiece and, worse still, you are probably condoning the irresponsible individual who did the cutting. And yes, Little Queenie, the complete 157 Riverside Avenue, Gary's Guitar Solo and Flying Turkey Trot are well worth one star each."
1,It's been hacked up by the studio editors.,"Can't tell you how many times I listened to this album in the 70's and 80's. Almost listened to it non-stop to Florida and back for spring break back then. My friends and I heard Little Queenie over and over and over. As soon as I found out that Little Queenie was cut from the CD release, I returned it. I suppose that I'll have to wait until someone at the studio hears enough complaints to re-release the original full album version of this REO masterpiece. I don't know what to say about my disappointment of 157 Riverside either. Should have been left as it was. Somebody really screwed up tampering with an old favorite, and it seems I'm not alone in feeling this way!"
2,"Not that funny. Actually, not that good at all...","I was very disappointed in this book. It just isn't funny. The stories are just plain lame. I'm also a firefighter, and I was expecting something that would at least make me chuckle once an a while. This book is just a collection of somewhat normal events. Most of these events take the author less than a page to write. So just think of this as 150 two paragraph emails that somebody wrote. I would not recommend this book as a gift, as a firefighter would not find this enjoyable.The preview or ""Search Inside"" section isn't like the rest of the book. The introduction is the only story that takes more than a page and a half.I wish the author the best of luck, and I would consider other titles from him. In this book, he really missed the opportunity to take some events and make them into stories others would enjoy."
3,The 6th Grade Nickname Game,"There are two boys that like to give nicknames and Jeff and Willey give this boy a nickmane and his nickname is called snoopy because he can't mind his on business. I like when they give each person nicknames. I recommend this book because this is a funny book and if you like joke books, this is the right book for you. You will like this book because this is a very funny book ."
4,Matching nicknames,This book is about two boys named wiley and jeff.they have nicknamed the people in Mr hughs (Mr. huges class)Then a new girl comes and they dont know what to name her so they think and think then they come up with carrot top but they did not like it.So they kept thinking and they really like eachother. wily and jeff go over to her house every day after school. They have a brick contest because they want charolete to like them alot.
4,Great to read aloud to class,"My sixth graders loved this book, and I especially loved reading it to them, embellishing it with dramatics. The description of the characters was right on the money, and we even came up with our own nicknames.Easy read, highly entertaining."
5,"Steve Martini delivers, again","A CEO of a Fortune 500 company is shot in her beach front home in La Jolla, California.

Paul is haunted by thoughts of his uncle throughout the trial, a solider in Korea during the 1950s. Double Tap is a well-written thriller that shows Paul Madriani's legal genius as well as his love for family. Double Tap keeps you guessing until the very end. Terrific read!"
2,Good Trial Scenes,"Abridged/CD: I had a bit of a problem with this audio because Joe Mantegna read it and he does the voice of the gangster on The Simpsons. It took a while to get into it because of that. I did enjoy the trial scenes.There is a midget prosecutor, who holds no punches, and goes up against our defense lawyer hero, Paul Madriani. It starts as a woman gets shot in the head twice in a military style ""double tap"" and her ex-military bodyguard is on trial for her murder. There were points that I felt should have been more detailed, but this was abridged. I felt the ending could have been better and it was a bit of a cop out. The big twist was kind of a yawn."
4,Tapped Out,"Good entry from this author. Courtroom procedurals are his specialty, however the ending disappoints."
2,needs a machete,"This one has a simple plot like ""True Crime""- but it's nothing special. Badly needs savage editing as it's at least 100 pages too long. A good editor would have given it a double tap at inception."
4,One of the Best Paul Madriani Novels Yet!,"This is Paul Madriani at his best. The strength of this character is that he is able to puzzle out some of the most difficult situations while keeping the rest of us guessing until the end. Harry Hinds at his side with his dry and never ending humor, they face a very tough case where everything and everyone is against them.This is a story of a combat veteran who is a difficult hero, yet a hero nonetheless. Paul and Harry have to take everything on faith and forge ahead to keep this man from facing the death penalty in a brutal murder of a corporate software executive.This is one that even if you think you know what will happen, you are most likely wrong. You will find yourself open-mouthed as the truth unfolds in a tense, well thought out conclusion."
2,let down,"The denoeument of this promising novel is such a cop out. The compelling first few scenes resolve in an uncompelling way. Although consistent with the plot, the reader is left with such a feeling of being let down. The plot is of course tied up, but so contrived! I felt like I read the 400 plus pages only to be hung out to dry."
1,Double Tap (by Steve Martini),"From the ""blurb"" I was expecting an exciting story with some risky adventures for the attorney trying to find the truth. But the truth is: it was just another boring courtroom book and the attorney did nothing more exciting than read a lot and the author spent more time expanding little details than I could ever have imagined was possible. It was a great disapointment as there was not one exciting event in the book. My most exciting moment was when I finished the last page."
2,Reviews by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller,"Double tap refers to the ""technique for firing two shots in quick succession into a single target."" In this story, the target is Madelyn Chapman's head. Emiliano Ruiz is accused of her murder. Paul Mandriani and his partner, Harry Hinds, are hired to defend Ruiz.Ms. Chapman was the founder and CEO of a successful software company, Isotenics, in LaJolla. Ruiz had been employed by the security company hired by Isotenics to provide executive protection. Prior to that, he had been a career soldier and there is proof the murder weapon is his.Most of the story is the trial and all the boring nitty details therein--the only bright spot is the freakish D.A. In fact, the author goes into a lot of details about everything. A side narrative comes and goes about Paul's uncle Evo and his PTSD after Korea...why?I've read Martini's other Mandriani stories, but it was a struggle to get through this one."
2,Boring,"Attorney Paul Madriani is back in another legal thriller by Steve Martini. This time Paul takes on the case of Emiliano Ruiz, an ex-military man who now does security work. Unfortunately, Ruiz had the misfotunate to be doing security work for murder victim, Madelyn Chapman. Chapman ran a software company heavily involved with government contracts. Not only did Ruiz do security work for Chapman, but he also had an affair with her before she unceremoniously dumped him. Ruiz has a ready-made motive of revenge and jealousy.The book started out promising, but quickly turned disappointing. The whole middle of the story just dragged until I found myself starting to skim...not a good sign. I've never really enjoyed government corruption stories. They tend to lend themselves to cliches and this one is no exception. I do like Paul Madriani as a character and I hope the next book has a better plotline."
3,Not one of my favorite Martini's,"Maybe if you are into the machinations of guns, and I am not, you can get more out of this, but I found it a little tedious and hard to believe."
4,This is a good read,Martini does a great job of weaving an interesting story. It held my interest but it was not as deep as some others that I've read. Certainly worth reading.
2,Writing style detracts from story,"While the story is an intriguing one and the characters lively and well drawn, I found the book almost unreadable. Why? Because Martini uses the present tense in describing the action. For example:""What's that?"", I ask....""Nothing,"" he says....I give him a look....""Who's Walt Eagan?"" says Harry....I suppose it is done to give the effect of immediacy - as if the action were happening RIGHT NOW. Instead, I have the feeling of crawling behind a sand crab as it meanders across a beach rather than an overview of the action and purpose of the story.I advise anyone caution in buying this book."
5,Very nice product,Very nice product good quality and everything fit perfectly and is not expensive.I have a Mazda 626 1997 2.0L MT
3,Suspenseful and unusual World War II film,"3 1/2 stars. This early Fred Zinnemann effort takes a humanistic look at pre-war Nazi Germany. It avoids the ""lets all hate the Germans"" stance of other war films of the early forties and while it shows evil Germans it also shows Germans whose innate decency compels them to aid the hero who is on the run from the Gestapo. Tracy, with minimal dialogue, gives a fine, intense performance. There is good work , too, from Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy. Zinnemann conveys considerable suspense as well as a completely believable European ambience."
3,Tandy & Croyn Brighten Up Grim Story,"Boy, this a grim story, but it gets you involved, especially if you tend to be a bit paranoid. The story centers around Spencer Tracy's character ""George Heisler"" hiding from the Nazis in 1936 Germany, not knowing who to trust.Although there's not much action, this is decently-paced with an unusual (and too corny) narrative from a dead man. The last 20 minutes, which should have been the most suspenseful of the film, instead wound up boring and too melodramatic.What I did find interesting was the very young couple of Jessica Tandy and husband Hume Cronyn. I had forgotten what a beautiful woman Tandy was when she was young. She and Hume were the best part of this film. Tracy, meanwhile, doesn't have a lot of dialog.The movie paints a horrible picture of pre-World War II Germany. There are several attempts to lift the spirits of the viewer as he watches this but overall it is a grim story of survival"
5,Showcases the best outdoor hiking trails available,"Wisconsin borders two of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. It is home to hardwood and evergreen forests, a superb system of lakes and streams, and a wealth of municipal, county, state, and national parks. In Hiking Wisconsin, Eric Hansen (who hiked over 800 miles of Wisconsin trails while working on this guide) showcases the best outdoor hiking trails available to the general public. Each hiking trail entry features hike descriptions, difficulty ratings, and trail lengths. Hiking Wisconsin is enhanced with ""user friendly"" maps, clear directions, information on camping, seasonal access, and trail restrictions. Hiking Wisconsin is the perfect ""take along"" guidebook whether you plan to be gone for an afternoon or a weekend or a week. If you are anticipating an outdoor excursion somewhere in the Badger State, then begin your planning by securing and browsing through a copy of Eric Hansen's Hiking Wisconsin!"
5,Hiking Wisconsin,Eric Hansen's guidebook provides the reader with hikes that take you away from traditional trails and allows the hiker solitude and ability to experience nature in some of its purest forms. I have personally travelled on some of the trails listed. His directions are clear. The book provides Eric's insight into various experiences along the routes. Erics's keen awareness of the environment and trail savvy makes this book a must for any serious trails enthusiast interested in the midwest outdoors.
5,Excellent CD!,"Item arrived in excellent condition. Besides it, I warmly recommend this CD to all who appreciate and understand classical music, and who enjoy Murray Perahia's playing, in particular."
5,Not just for babies,My 2 year old is still enjoying the games and songs and she sings along now. I put the lullabies (2nd half) on when I put her down for her nap. It's nice to have the book to so I can learn the words and sing to her. The book also tells all the motions that go with the baby games. I highly recommend this CD and book set for every mom and her little ones!
3,Good for the price..but...,"The product is good for the price and you get a good quantity of makeup. The problem I have with it is that it's not smudge resistant like it says, nor is it waterproof, don't believe for a second that it is. But then again it really depends what you're trying to conceal, if you have big skin problems like hyperpigmentation, or dark spots ect ect then it will cover them....but it smudges....I strongly recommend if you do buy this product to buy a makeup setting spray or powder. I will buy the product again because it does conceal VERY well, but I don't want my makeup coming off everywhere so I will invest in a setting spray, please do the same."
2,"It covers, but its a mess","I have some pretty strong pigment marks on my face. Smart Cover covered them, but it comes off on everything. Everything I touched the day I wore it had makeup on it. I went back to my Revlon foundation the next day. Thankfully I hadn't paid much for this. I can't imagine wearing it on my legs the way its advertised, my car, clothing, furniture would be a mess."
1,Dont' waste your money!,"This is not a product that you should buy on line. Noone knows what skin tone they are unless you have their product samples in front of you.I have fair skin and wanted the lightest cream possible. Their lightest colored tube was darker than I could ever tan in a whole summer.The only product that was actually matchig my skin tone was the cover stick that is supposed to be used for faces. It is one thing in the kit that I was able to use. I use it for my legs varicose veins, small blemishes and scarrs etc. Even on the beach.Be aware that you are stuck with this purchase, no matter what.I tried to get my money back, but by LAW they could not do that.Careful of what you spend money on unless you get a money back guarantee on it. It was a waste of money. Not a great deal. How ever, you could probably use the tubes for shoe cream!!"
4,smart cover... really does work....,"It takes a bit to get the exact match for your color, but when you do... it covers well & for most of the day!!"
5,A must for students of Texas history,You can't know all you need to know about Texas without having a good knowledge of the Comanches. They are as important to the development of the state as any other group and yet they are often overlooked in surveys of Texas history.
1,Manifest Destiny apologist,"I find the author's unqualified, and rather anectodal, anthropological conclusions about a 100 years out of date(""barbarian"" and ""savage"" aren't scientific terms). Rather than quoting primary sources so support his facts he seems to prefer re-interpreting them in his own bias; on occasion I happened to have read the source text and found he had grossly misrepresented it, which makes me very suspicious of the rest of his facts. The whole book is extremely biased in favour of manifest destiny - it often reads like a justification for destructions of the native peoples and their culture."
3,Did not love it!,"The premise of the book is good, but I found that parts of it were very slow reading. I would not recommend it as highly as some of the other books I have read about the Comanche people. Interesting enough, but not great."
1,deceived,The picture of this made me feel like i was receiving a combo and that is not the case I only received one pacifier and it didn't even look like the ones in the picture.
2,Opinionated and not meticulous,"I reaad this in June of 1952 and commented on it as follows: ""Of course it is a very weak book because one can't trust it. It has that about it, just like a Drew Peason (he had nothing to do with this book) column which requires that all be taken with a consideration of the source. Further, it was written in 1950 and is greatly dated. It has the style of 1932's Washinton Merry-Go-Round in an age which hasoutgrown that style and demands facts, not generalizations. All the people that are called stupid--but this book is obviously written by very stupid guys. Mind you, I agree with the political bias of the authors. It is that they wrote a poor book--hasty, superficial and unbearably loaded with blacks and whites. A tendency to sweeping over all condemnation re Congress was especially notorious. I rejected the portraits of congressman as totally lacking in the research and attention required."
2,not as advertised,"The iboost package says it will add 7 hours for video. Mine added 4.5. The instructions say it will fully charge in 4.5 hours. Mine takes around 9. I called them. They said the charge time listed is not valid. Hmmm. They said the video time will vary. I ran the video as a test, and did not touch the ipod except to start the movie again. I should have the maximum time, shouldn't I? their answer is that times will vary. Hmmm.I may return mine. Not sure. It is nice in that is fits well (on my 5G), is compact and rechargable. BUT keep in mind my figures above."
4,ipod batter booster,"It works and arrived promptly. Not sure what else to say. It Doesn't quite fit the mini, but I am making it work for me."
2,"Worked well, at first","I've had the Nyko battery pack for a year or more, and have used it regularly since then (anywhere from 10-40 hours a week). It worked as advertised at first, and seemed to add approximately the amount of time (16 hours) which it claimed to.But over the past several months it seems to be steadily losing capacity. It will go from fully charged to dead after 2 - 4 hours of use. Also it seems to lose charge even when it's not in use and disconnected from the iPod (this shouldn't happen with lithium batteries).Overall, it's a decent product when it's working. I don't know if mine is defective, or if this product was just designed with an extremely finite lifespan."
5,Unbelievable!,"I ran out to buy my copy of The Way/Solitaire during lunch today (release day). I love ""The Way"" and could not wait to hear Clay do ""Solitaire"" and had been counting the days to the release. I was not disappointed.""The Way"" is a beautiful love song. I loved it on the album, I still love it. It reminds me of how I feel about my husband that I've been married to for the past 13+ years and I can't help but smile when I listen to it.""Solitaire"" actually took my breath away. The arrangement is stunning and Clay's voice is simply extraordinary. His phrasing and his pure voice with that amazing tone are showcased to their fullest extent in this song. BRAVO to Clay and to RCA on this song."
5,Back to the Basics,"This is a must have for every Clay fan! Ok, for EVERYBODY!! We all fell in love with his voice on American Idol 2. That is what Solitaire is all about. The Voice! Perfection to the limit! I can't stop listening. Clay is pure talent thru and thru!!"
5,Clay Has Outdone Himself Again,"I'll first comment on The Way, which is slowly getting noticed on CHR. It is a very likeable pop song, It has a wonderful, feel good vibe. There is a great ""glory note"" near the end, that I love and it wowed me...that is until I heard Solitaire.I now understand why RCA opted not to have this on Clay's first album. It is way way out of that league. Clay surpassed all my expectations and made this song entirely his own. You must purchase this CD, if only for Solitaire because it is a beautiful masterpiece. Clay owned this song, no other versions will ever compare. As Neil Sedaka (original composer and singer) said with tears in his eyes ""I have forever lost my song, it will always be a Clay Aiken song"""
5,Amazing single!,"I love ""The Way""! It's a great single choice. A nice, softer ballad from Clay. It's the perfect precedent from ""Invisible"". His versiobn of ""Solitare"" is also a top-notch song! It's amazing!!I definitely recomment this single!!"
5,Fantastic Single,"I bought this after hearing an amazing live performance of Solitaire. I'm not a fan of pop music at all, the bands I listen to are The Beatles, Rush, Led Zeppelin, and what not. But Clay Aiken definitely has a unique sound in his voice that I bet not too many people in this world have, his vocal range is truly unbelievable, which he proves on ""Solitaire"" his best song by far, which is also a cover. Anyway, the single ""The Way"" is also a great song, so this CD definitely is worth checking out, if you like it, try previewing ""Measure of a Man"" in a store before purchasing it, since it's a little different than ""Solitare"" I give props to Clay, he definitely has great talent, and hopefully a wonderful future in the music industry."
5,I'M PLAYING SOLITAIRE,"Once again, Clay Aiken hits one out of the park. This is a terrific compliment to ""Bridge Over Troubled Water."" Clay's voice is a breath of fresh air. He adds his own unique flavor to each recording with great success. ""Solitaire"" is now one of my favorite Clay Aiken songs. If you have the first single, then you'll definitely want to add this one to your collection. I'm so glad that he had the opportunity to record this great song. It is new again."
5,Flawless,"I adore Clay's voice. To me, he will always be the winner of season two. And this single is his best release yet. ""The Way"" is a lovely, pleasant song that might not fit well in today's radio climate but still showcases a great melody and voice.However, the real reason to buy this single is ""Solitaire"". I was amazed by Clay's rendition on the show last year. And this version is even better. The power of this vocal is stunning. My only suggestion: the label should push ""Solitaire"" as the A-side. This song would probably be a much bigger hit than ""The Way"" - which is a bit too AC. Hopefully, radio stations will start playing ""Solitaire"" instead - in a recording that equals the Carpenters' great cover from the 1970s.LS"
5,I am STILL at a loss for words!,"I have listened to this single for almost an entire week, and the song Solitaire STILL gives me chills! Clays voice is so amazing!WE THE FANS KNEW ALL ALONG THAT CLAY HAS A WORLD-CLASS VOICE, and even though I really like Measure of a Man (I give it a rating of 5 stars), the songs on MOAM do not even come close to the EXQUISITE music and lyrics of Solitaire. There are not enough stars to rate Clays performance on Solitaire. Maybe 100 stars would be a start!It is shameful that Simon dogged on Clay to try and support Ruben. Clay deserved better than that! In the end though, all of Simon's barbs against Clay were irrelevant, as WE THE FANS HAVE SPOKEN! WE KNOW WHO REALLY WON!CLAY ROCKS!!!!!!!"
5,CLAY AIKEN THE NEW POP SOUND,"I BELIEVE WE ARE ABOUT TO SEE THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW POP SOUND OF TOMORROW. THE PURE SINGER, WITH NO SPECIAL SOUNDS OR COMPUTER GENERATED NOISE TO CHANGE HIS VOICE. JUST BEATIFUL PURE MUSIC LIKE IT SHOULD BE. I THINK THIS GUY HAS A VOICE THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL IT TO YOUR SOUL. THIS IS ANOTHER POWERFUL AND TOUCHING SONG AND CLAY AIKEN HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST AWESONE SINGER IN MUSIC TODAY AND THESE 2 SONGS THE WAY & SOLITAIRE PROVE HIM TO BE JUST THAT."
1,Bad stuff,"This is an awful butchering of the Neil Sedaka/Carpenters classic. Not only do we have cheesy sounding computer drums here, Aikin does not even know how to pronounce the word solitaire (the ""sol"" in solitaire rymes with mile, not Paul, they should have named this song saulitaire lol), much less sing the song. He barely got a note of the original melody right in this monstrosity. yuck! I have a question, does anyone like Clay Aikin that didn't start liking him watching the extremely cheesy American Idol? All American Idol is is a show that proves TV executives know how to herd sheep. 90% of the people that like him will be embarrassed they ever liked him 10 years from now. Anyone remember the Bay City Rollers and New Kids on the block? Jokes all."
2,A good song but for alittel while!,This song was ok when I heard it but after a while I got sick of it!This song get's annoying very fast but if your a Claymate get this if your just browsing to get a good single then dont get this!
1,It's Not Worth It,Don't believe the hype! Clay Aiken? Big deal. I'd rather spend my money on Sonny and Cher's greatest hits. Save your money people for better music.
1,Karen Carpenter is rolling over in her grave,"Barf. Clay Aiken has taken a great Carpenters song and just mauled it to death by doing vocal acrobatics repeatedly on its head until all meaning died a horrible, gasping death. Karen Carpenter knew something none of these American Idol kids have learned...subtlety. Not every single line needs to be belted out as you zoom through three octaves. Sometimes quiet and simple says it best.Or as Ani DiFranco says, ""Half of knowing how to play, is knowing what NOT to play."" We all know you can sing Clay. Now try to mean what you're singing."
5,It keeps getting better!,"I am more and more impressed with my first and, so far, only American Idol choice, Clay Aiken. And I am so proud to say that I am just one of millions of others who feel the same. Open your mind to the fact that American Idol could have come across a truly talented artist who brings power, love and depth to each Measure and, I promise, you will not be disappointed in this purchase. Try it! Listen to it! Love it!"
1,SECOND TO NONE!!!,"The Way captured my heart the first time I listened to it on the Measure of a Man CD....and I am still playing it and still loving it. What a beautiful song and Clay singing it...nothing could be better.Solitaire...have always loved this song going back to when Neil Sedaka sang it. Neil is right...his song is now and forever a Clay Aiken song. What an amazing interpretation...brought tears to my eyes and chills in my bones. I can no longer imagine ANYONE ever doing justice to this song but Clay. The long ""glory note"" .......HEART-STOPPING AND SPINE-CHILLING. WAY TO GO CLAY!!!"
5,Pure Perfection,"Solitaire will make chills run down your spine. This is an incredible song sung by an incredible singer. 'The Way'is a very romantic song,sung with so much emotion by Mr.Aiken.You surely will not be disappointed with this CD-Single. I highly recomend it."
5,Clay Aiken The Way/Solitaire,"I absolutely love The Way/Solitaire. Both of these songs showcase Clay's amazing vocal talents. These songs are about the voice. Simply beautiful. I would highly recommend this CD to everyone who appreciates great music, I would not be surprised if Clay had the biggest selling single two years running with this one."
5,Absolutely amazing vocal performance!!!!!,"This is my first music review EVER. I just wanted to say BUY THIS SINGLE..you won't be disappointed. Clay Aiken gives the best vocal performance on Solitaire that I have ever heard him give. You will get chills!!! The Way is a just a great love song, plain and simple."
5,"OOPS, HE DID IT AGAIN!!!!!!","Mr. Aiken, no wonder we love you!!!! This two-sided single is absolutely wonderful. I bought it today and probably have worn it out already. ""The Way"" is one of my favorites from his album and I can't listen to it enough. But SOLITAIRE is so beautiful and he has made it his own version!!! I get goosebumps listening to this man's magnificant voice!!! Just pure perfection!!!! Can't wait to see what is next!!! DON'T MISS HIS CONCERT EITHER!!! ITS WONDERFUL!!!!!""Annie in Ohio"""
5,Amazing,"Solitaire brought me to tears. It is just 5 minutes of bliss- especially the last minute following that ridiculously beautiful glory note. Clay Aiken continues to amaze me every day, he is a wonderful performer and artist and this single proves it"
5,This cd will BLOW YOUR MIND!!,Clay Aiken is just the #1 star in THE WORLD TODAY! HE IS INCREDIBLE!!!!! Solitaire is a WONDERFUL song that ClayBLOWS THE ROOF OFF! U MUST HEAR IT TO BELIEVE IT! The Waywill melt ANYONE!! PLEASE BUY THE ALBUM! IT IS AMAZING!!!!Heather
5,YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED......,"if you purchase this CD! THE WAY is a beautiful song; in fact my favourite song from the CD ""Measure of a Man""! But Clay's version of SOLITAIRE is breathtaking! I have now been listening to this CD for a week non stop in my car and I can't get enought of it! I plan to purchase a few more CDs as gifts for my friends and family as I know they will get enjoyment out of it and so will you if you buy it!"
5,Breathtaking Greatness In Song!,"To say these are great songs would be a travesty! The Way soars with Clay Aiken's vocals. His phrasing is so awesome on the song! The way that you move me. . . sing it Clay! Just one of many great songs on his Measure Of A Man cd. The Neil Sedaka song Solitaire . . . there are not enough subperlatives to describe this song! Solitaire is one of those ""song of songs"" that will now and always be associated with Clay Aiken. What he does with this is amazing! It is hauntling beautiful, reaching in and touching your heart so softly, as it soars in your soul. This man can sing."
5,Haunting....,"I already like Clay Aiken quite a bit, but this CD with Solitare is just amazing. His voice haunts me and I can't help but play it over and over again. Great CD and of course to have another copy of the beautiful song ""The Way"" is great!"
5,Solitaire - A Masterpiece,"Since I have The Way in Measure of a Man, I bought this CD for Solitaire. This is, by far, the best version I have ever heard and no words can really express how wonderful it is. Clay has really hit the nail on the head with this rendition. It should be showcased on a stage with an orchestra backing. Goosebumps galore!!!!! Love The Way, also. But, Solitaire is IT!!!!!!! In other words - magnificent. Any adjective you want to use that means greatness will do."
5,A STUNNING MASTERPIECE!,"THE WAY IS MY FAVORITE ON MOAM, TOUCHING YOUR HEART, AND PIERCING YOUR SOUL! IT'S THE A SIDE OF THIS REMARKABLE CD. SOLITAIRE WILL LEAVE YOU GASPING FOR AIR, IT'S THAT DEEP!!!! CLAY STARTS SLOW SINGING WITH DEEP EMOTION,EVERY WORD YOU CLING TO. CLAY MAKES YOU FEEL THE SONG, THEN WHAM HE HITS THE GLORY NOTE,SENDS YOU REELING INTO SPACE, YOUR NOW IN A DAZE BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCCUMBED TO BEAUTY BEYOND WORDS. THIS SONG IS CLAYS BEST! AND NOW MY PERSONAL FAVORITE! THIS SONG SHOWCASES CLAY'S VOCALS TO PERFECTION, SHEER BEAUTY...... RUN, AND I MEAN RUN AND GRAB THIS C.D......"
4,Clay's amazing performance,"As I stated in my previous review for Clay's album ""Measure of a Man"", the original material recorded for that album was rather bland. I stated that Clay's next album needs to include more of what Clay does best, re-making classis tunes and making them all his own. He did this on his first single with his remake of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"". His album did not include any cover versions, but to boost sales of this single, they added a new track. Clay's cover of the Carpenters hit ""Solitaire"" (written and also recorded by Neil Sedaka) is so completely different from the original that the casual listener may not even realize they are the same song. Buy this single for ""Solitaire"", and hope that the record exec's wise up and let Clay do more songs like this on his next album."
5,Awesome,I heard Clay sing Solitaire on American Idol and loved it - so I purchased this single. I have to say that his rendition of this classic song on this single is the most incredible I have ever heard. It takes my breath away.The Way is a beautiful song as well. I enjoy listening to it over and over.This single is a must have. It is an awesome addition to my music collection!
5,Best ever,I have a never heard a song that was interpreted with such feeling and emotion. Clay Aiken is destined to be one of the foremost singers in this country. The song builds slowly and intentionally to grasp your heart and then at the end he breaks it just as his heart was broken.
3,Clay's OK,"I think that Clay has a nice voice and his album is fine.I must admit that I was a fan of the song ""The Way"" before Clay had it on his album.Dan Gardner the NBC Today Show's ""Superstar Winner"" (a talent show that was created by the executive producers of American Idol and the Today Show)actually performed and recorded the song before Clay did.Dan did an amazing job on the Today Show, and deserves a listen. His album is available on amazon as well, Dan Gardner ""More than Life.""Clay's album is good, but Dan's album is great!Just my opinion.Susan"
1,For older people,Okay people if you are under 40 this is not for you yet unless you like elton john and barry manilow. yuck
1,Clay-great/Production-horrible,"The Way is fine, it's also on Clay's album but the fans have been waiting for the release of Solitaire for ages and Clay's voice soars but not over the grating and distracting percussion during the middle verses of Solitaire...I actually returned the CD thinking it was defective. Since that time I have listened to several copies on 3 different players and it is the production of the song that truly is awful. Clay and Neil deserved better."
1,way way way over rated!,This is horrible! I have never heard of such an artist who has been sooooooo hugely over rated. I when to the Independent tour on April.6 and clay just bored me to death!Kelly Clarkson is way way way better!
5,Clay touches my heart with his music,Solitaire is my all-time favorite from Clay but all of his music touches my heart like no one else. He's the next Sinatra!
5,Great Music Is Back,"Until Clay Aiken's CD's, I had been totally turned off by the music being released. I have now bought all three CD's. The Way had been my favorite and then came Solitaire. It is an incredibly awesome rendition of a great song. It is so nice to enjoy music again. I hope the music industry will take note. We will buy if you give us a good product. Thanks, Clay."
5,No Cheating at Solitaire...,"Finally, a Clay Aiken recording that captures the glory of his unique voice. No overproduction, background music drown-outs, or studio razzle-dazzle. Just his pure, emotive singing that touches, tingles, and raises goosebumps. 'Solitaire', which gives us a huge helping of what more is to come from this amazingly talented performer, provides an achingly lovely 5 minutes and 26 seconds of music that will satisfy any Clay fan and create new ones with one listen. Everyone comes out a winner with this rendition of 'Solitaire'. By 'The Way', the A side of this single should not be ignored; it is a favorite from his triple platinum CD, Measure of a Man. It is a pretty safe bet that The Way/Solitaire will be the best selling single of 2004."
5,S'Way,"They say you can't buy happiness. Well, (...) you can certainly come close with this Clay Aiken signle. His appeal is so mass, it transcends between a 7 year old neighbor and my 72 year old grandma. Clay has this charm that is so unbelievably kind and classy that you have a hard time denying him a listen.WARNING: When you pop the CD in, you may feel excesive heart palipatations and shortness of breath. Don't worry, this is normal.Clay's interpretation of ""Solitaire"" is enough to bring tears to anyone's eyes. The slight a cappella tone to the song proves that Clay Aiken has an ability to transform a song without heavy acommpianment. It's truly a beautiful song and the single is worth it for that one song. However, CLay throws us a double whammy with ""The Way"", a beautiful love song that was featured in his triple platinum ""Measure of a Man"".Do yourself a favor and listen to this Cd, I personally guarentee a ""clayversion""."
5,"CLAY, CLAY, CLAY!","If you liked Clay Aiken's performance of Solitaire on American Idol Wednesday night, you are going to LOVE this CD. The short version on American Idol just didn't do it justice.Clay's rendition of Solitaire is 5 minutes, 26 seconds of pure, utter BLISS. The orchestration, that voice, and (oh my), that GLORY NOTE! TO DIE FOR!I own his debut album, Measure of a Man, which includes The Way and is also one of my favorites. However, Solitaire is my new favorites.Everyone should own this CD. It's sure to be a timeless classic."
5,OUT OF THIS WORLD! OMG GET IT!,this man takes my breath away. Neil Sedaka wrote this song alot of singers like elvis have sung it but none like Clay Aiken. This man takes every song and makes it sound better. The other side to the amazing Solitaire is the WAY which is from his CD Measure of A Man! This song also is outstanding and very romantic. Thank you Clay again for being the most amazing talent I have seen or heard since Elvis.
5,breath-taking...,"This is one great cd!!! Clay Aiken's voice just soars!!! The essence of Clay's talent shines through in Solitaire and you feel like you've been flown to another world with him, along with the meaning of the song. Chill-inducing and incredibly breath-taking. Definitely a must buy!"
5,"A hauntingly, breathtaking masterpiece!","The Way is a beautiful song. Clay captures your heart with his beatutful voice. This is a hit song!Solitaire. What can I say. This is Clay at his finest. Clay's voice just soars on this song. His power, range and gentle beauty oooozes in emotion that sucks you in, and your never the same again. It is a hauntingly, breathtaking masterpiece. I recomend this single and the full album Measure of a Man. What a talent that cannot be matched!"
5,The best I have ever heard!!!!!!!!!,"The Way/Solitaire, is the best I have ever heard and I can predict it would be the best single in 2004! I will be very surprised if this won't happen.It's definitely a masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Words Cannot Describe,"I have been a fan of Clay's since season 2 of ""American Idol"" began. When I saw his performance of ""Solitaire"" on the show, I thought it was stunning. I remember saying how I wished he would've been able to sing the entire song. As soon as this single came out, I bought it. Words truly cannot describe how beautiful it is, but I'll try to do it justice. The song keeps building until the last minute, and the song erupts into the best performance I've heard from him. The power, strength, and passion behind the words is the most breathtaking thing I have heard. Clay fans, and those who aren't Clay fans but love music, you all owe it to yourselves to listen to that song. I recommend this to anyone and everyone."
5,OUTSTANDING MR AIKEN!!!,WOW.....I MEAN WOW!! CLAYS VERSION OF SOLITAIRE IS BREATHTAKING. TONIGHT ON AMER.IDOL CLAY SANG SOLITAIRE....IT WAS AWESOME. THANKS TO CLAY WE CAN FINALLY BREATH A SIGH...A REAL ARTIST.GOD HAS BLESSED CLAY WITH A BEAUTIUL VOICE AND CLAY SHARES IT WITH US. CLAY IS GOING TO BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME..FOR THOSE IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY WHO THOUGHT AMER.IDOL CONTESTANTS WERE A JOKE...
5,MASTERPIECE!,Clay Aiken has the most breathtaking voice. He just carried me into his soul with that voice. Thank you Clay and Neil Sedaka for this wonderful song. Recommend HIGHLY!
1,trying to convense,"clay sound's ok, but nothing special, now josh groben that's what you call some real talent, clay's music does'nt fit into todays genre, more like broadway..but even then I don't think he would last, his songs all sound a like, if clay was so good, then why does'nt the radio station's play him, if you like the old perry como 1950"" then clay is for you, this is 2004 and music have changed, if he want to appeal to the masses, then he need's to come up with something other than broadway or lounge music, it put's me to sleep, his fan's..well there different, they said they would buy clays cd even if he would sing the telephone book, now does that tell you what kind of fan's he has, like no other artist's fan's..there in a class all by themselves, I think the public would like clay so much better if he did'nt have the type of fan's that fellow him, like there's no tomorrow, well all i got to say is more power to them."
3,Disappointed....,"After several months of waiting for the single ""Solitaire"" to come out, I felt disappointed when I finally heard this version.I think it's a bit over produced and over the top. As with Aiken's other songs in his Album ""Measure of a Man"", he has a tendency to over sell a song."
5,Do Not Miss This,"Though I do like The Way very much... the real killer on this disk is Solitaire. No one should pass this up. It is absolutely fantastic, a true classic. This is the song, that in years to come people will be decrying the fact that they never purchased it. It is a true collector's item."
5,Low note to Glory note and beyond!,"The Way-- true romantic song perfect for the young couple hoping for a first kiss all the way to the long-married older set to dance and sit by the fireplace holding hands.Solitaire-- starts out slow and haunting, as originally written, to a crescendo of all crescendos! Clay Aiken is a five octave tenor who can outsing all those other so-called singers! Listen for the awesome low-note of ""broken"" to the glory of a full 17 second note where Clay doesn't even pause but continues as though it took no effort at all! Oh my God, Clay is truly a gifted singer! THANK YOU CLAY AIKEN FOR GIVING US THIS WORK OF PURE AWE-INSPIRING HEAVEN! I will treasure it all my life!"
5,John Waters: this Filthy World Review,This was purchased as a Christm gift. It arrived very quickly and the recipient was very surprised and delighted with it.
1,Obsolete Software,"Caution to prospective buyers - this software does not appear to be compatible with Windows XP (I'm guessing it won't work with Vista or Windows 7 either). The software itself may be great, but that doesn't do you much good if it won't run on your PC. We couldn't even get the program to open after installation. After doing some searching on the internet, we found some tips on .dll files that could be deleted or modified to make the program run. This got us to the point of being able to open the program at least, but then it still crashes when you click on almost anything. To make matters worse, Sierra apparently has been bought out by Activision and no longer has any support for this software."
4,Shart Retractor Stick Vacuum EP604,"My wife finds her new Shark Vacuum better then the first one we purchased. It is quite, and seems to vacuum better then the first one.Also the retractable cord is a plus.For the price we think this was a great buy. Also the shipping time was great, we received the product a couple of days early.Have a great week."
5,Altar Guild Saved by a Shark,"I purchased the Shark Stick Vac for use at our church. We had been using an upright for our cleaning and some of our members were complaining about its weight. Well, there are no more complaints about weight and nothing but raves about the Sharks cleaning ability. And to top it off, the tools are onboard as opposed to in a box that you must carry around. GREAT PRODUCT!"
1,Dissappointing product,"The vacuum does not pick up much of anything except dust. I was very disappointed with the performance. I was given this as a gift and the person who purchased it was going by the name of Shark and expected better results. Works OK on my kitchen floor, but would not reccomend for carpets."
1,disappointing performer,"This little vacuum would be great if it ACTUALLY vacuumed up anything. Does a poor job on my wood floors, my old fashioned broom does a better job. As for carpeting, doesn't pick up anything. And pet hair? Forget it.A big waste of money.I'd rate it zero stars if I could, I'm tossing it."
2,No carpets; difficult on hardwood,"Plusses -- retractable cord; aesthetically more pleasant design; not super loudMinuses -- useless on any carpet; works on hardwood and linoleum if you can manage to avoid it blowing everywhere right before you get to it. Unfortunately the vents are angled poorly and blow away the very things you are trying to pick up. I have resorted to going back to my broom as it is easier to have to pick up what this vacuum cleaner leaves behind. In terms of power, I would prefer a more powerful suction."
3,Good for bare floors,"It won't pick up any lint on my area rug, but it does a great job on the bare floors. I need one that does both carpet and floors (I don't have enough storage for both), so I'm taking this one back.I don't know why this is tagged as cordless, it has a cord."
3,Cuttlebone,More for finches than cockatiels who need bigger thicker cuttlebones. But my cockatiels ate them just the same. Ok product
4,The birds love it!,"The birds love these, and they attach well to the side of the cage. They last a long time, and are a great value."
3,Tavares Original Hits,The cd has all of the Tavares most popular songs at a great price. I wish it had been re-mastered because the dynamic range of the music is lacking.
1,Madame Bovary,"Boring, This book has a history, I did not find it interesting, it was laborious reading and I still cannot decide to finish it or notbother."
4,Great reads..,"It was all I like in the novel, the only thing I was hoping for a different end. Other than that: Great!"
4,Madame Bovary,A historical novel that certainly in its time was considered a racy and perhaps even a vilgar literary work. Compared with today - harmless yet the moral tragedy and destruction of someone leading a life of unguraded dreams is the same today. Your own personal destruction destroys those who love you - even if tha live is undeserved.
2,Wanted to ring Emma's neck *Grrrrrrrr*,"I can only imagine that for its time ""Madame Bovary"" must have been quite the shocking novel, dealing with the topics of adultery and religion, and I can appreciate the stir it must have caused.That being said I had a hard time reading the book and it took me quite a while to finish it. Some parts of the book started off very interesting and then seemed to just drag on, add to that the fact that there was nothing about Emma Bovary that I liked. She was a spoiled, self indulgent, mean person and I think if she lived today would have been diagnosed with some type of mood disorder. It always seemed like nothing was ever good enough for her and she liked to manipulate situations. I actually felt very bad for her husband, and could not understand why he loved her so much. The saddest thing about the whole story though seems to be that the only person who really seemed to suffer was Berthe, I hope she finds happiness in her life."
5,Definition of tragedy,"None should miss reading this book. The story is told in a way that helps one see the broad spectrum of life dark colors. What struck me with this book was the way the author had done such a detailed psychological description of his characters. I feel that it is something on which French authors are really skilled at. They understand hidden elements in a person's mind and behavior. Gustave Flaubert creates and develops his characters with so much skill, depth and in a dimension that is surprising. What is white in the beginning, turns black in a matter of pages. It's amazing how he surprises the reader with human behavior. The story line is solid, the plot flows naturally and it grips one's attention to a point that even if you miss reading for a few days the story is still fresh in one's mind and when you start reading again, it is as if you never stopped reading in the first place. The book ends by defining tragedy - and it is not betrayal, rather life itself is the tragedy."
1,Bad translation,"Take the story for what you will, this is a rough, horrendous and difficult translation of what should have been a magnificently written book.Save yourself the trouble, buy any other version. Free isn't worth it if the story is so compromised."
3,Madame Bovary,"A book of its time, but still with a message for today's readers. Flaubert's keen observation of people, their strengths, weaknesses, desires and needs, intelligence and stupidity will always offer food for thought."
3,Tragic Medieval Woman,"I read this book because the characters in it have been referred to in other books, so I was curious. This is a classical period piece about the whirlwind of tragedies that surround a beautiful young woman when she is able to follow her every whim. Even today, anyone who has dated a pretty young woman (or handsome young man, come to think of it...) can relate to this story in some degree. Everyone in her life is blinded by their infatuation for her and foolishly allows her to run amok with their feelings and finances. It's a sad story, but like all tragedies, timeless in the lessons to be learned from it."
4,Classic read on a Kindle,Madame Bovary is a classic. A classic that was improved by downloading it on a Kindle. The archaic language and the ability to quickly look up definitions was worth the price of admission.
4,A good read,"It probably helped that I had read the original, albeit 20 years ago, so knew to expect a good story.Sadly, on occasion the translation seemed lazy and a few typos had crept in.All in all a good classic. I am glad I re-read it."
1,Flaubert Would Roll Over in his Grave,"Having originally read MADAME BOVARY in French, I am bound to find English versions disappointing, though, over the years, I have twice read acceptable translations. From Amazon, I bought the General Books paperback, and I cannot comprehend how Marx Aveling could allow it to appear for sale, especially after her adoring Flaubert prologue. The publisher scanned her copy without proofing it, and there are so many typos it's virtually unreadable.The language is as forced and artificial as Flaubert's is natural and true. He created such marvelous characters that they manage to struggle through this mess and touch the reader. But I implore people not to read this genius author in this disgrace of a book. - Ann Seymour"
1,Terrible translantion,"As one reads farther into the book, the quality of the translation declines. Did the translator lose interest? Did his language abilities begin to fail? Was he on a fixed price contract? Who knows? The text, however, becomes less and less readable as the book goes on. Fail."
4,teresa,"The story was good. The language was beautiful. It is what made the book for me. Although the language reflected the period, the story is timeless."
4,Need to read,This is one of those classics that you may want to allude to whenever you encounter the needy woman character who is never satisfied. It's depressing and she is annoying but it's a good book to have read at least once.
1,Audio book - wrong reader,"There is no doubt but that this is a magnificent new translation, and Lydia Davis is to be congratulated.But who on earth decided to let Leelee Sobieski read it? The book was so ruined for me that I had to buy a hard-cover copy to get the most out of it. The book is read in a gruff, teen-speak monotone with even the most basic English words being mispronounced - not to mention horrendous versions of the most basic French vocabulary. Even the place names of Rouen and Tostes are mispronounced. Could someone not have given her some simple French pronunciation hints? And we do not get even the slightest indication of characterisation. The reading just drones on and on. Listen to Claire Bloom reading of Balzac's ""La Cousine Bette""....absolute magic. I'm tempted to ask for my money back."
3,Okay....but...slow.,"Betrayal? Hidden passions? Longing? Scorned Lovers? Sick with grief, unrequited love, and the misery of waiting? Tolstoy did it better. :)"
3,Not bad for a free version,"For a free version, it's really not bad. I also found the random footnotes & highlights distracting but not enough to keep me from continuing to read it. A table of contents for such a dense book would've been nice, but again, it's free & maybe someday if i have the time I'll figure out how to do that myself."
4,Much to think about,As will all of Marian Green's books there is so much packed into this one. Info about each of the 8 festivals plus other seasonal events that are cause for celebration. I have 3 festival books and this one points out various things that I haven't found in others. Celebrate each season to the fullest! Get a deeper understanding of the earth and the traditions which we celebrate. If you love Marian Green you need this one.
3,What happened to the rest of the song?,"Cassette arrived on time as described. BUT - horrible edit on the tape. Fade in on songs, last song just ends during great solo. Whole band sounds great but the editing kills album. Wish they would remaster and release on cd."
5,The Gripper Jar Opener,This is the solution to the resistant jar lid for those with weak wrists.Opens jars like magic. Love it!
2,Gripper jar opener,"First time I used it on a small lid, it didn't work! Seems to work on metal lids better. I have arthritis, so I need a tool I can count on. I don't think this is it."
5,Gives you the extra boost you need.,"My mom suffers from arthritis, and the strength in her hands has diminished over the years. Before I bough her this product she would need help to open almost anything. The independence this thing gives her is definitely five stars."
4,Jar opener aide,"As we age, and after suffering with wrist tendonitis, opening jars becomes very difficult. This device takes care of that problem, although I haven't used it on many size jars as yet. I expect it will do the job quite well."
5,It really can remove camera filters,"If you have ever had a filter get stuck on a lens, and you really couldn't remove it, and those silly ""lens wrenches"" are utterly useless ... well, this works.Nuff said."
3,Not As Durable!,"First i bought this from a Good Rating Bizrate Online store. Most items sold are considered premium quality. With that in mind i figure this product (though price seems slightly STEEP) was a no brainer necessity. They say, ""you get what you pay for"". Umm.. Right! I had this just over a year, one of the geared jaws just POPPED OFF. I tried to re insert it and being REAL CAREFUL, it worked! (Temporary) BTW, I have some limitation of using Two hands, so this was a Godsend, NOT! Oh well, now to go through all the hassle of getting some credit since ITS A 5 YR LIMITED WARRANTY! Oh just my luck! I suggest another Lid Opener."
4,It broke!,"After depending on this generally wonderful and effective gadget for more than a year (including mastering ways of holding recalcitrant slippery jars while turning the handle), it suddenly lost its grip! Just won't stay closed. Disappointed but still going to order another one."
5,Excellent product,"For many years, I have been looking for a jar opener that was able to open jars with minimum effort. I found the Kuhn Rikon gripper jar on the Internet. Most of the reviews were very positive, so I ordered one. It works great; I'm extremely happy with the product!"
5,I'll never buy another kind,"I had a jar opener for years than consisted of sliding the jar lid into a v-shaped slot with ""teeth"". While sometimes it took a few tries or slipped out, It was beyond helpful until I finally broke it recently.TJ Maxx often has great cooking gadgets cheaper than I can find them in department stores and I nabbed this kind there recently.It's by the far the best jar opener I've used. with one turn it locks the lid into lace so a small twist of the wrist easily removes even really stubborn lids. And it locks onto any size lid...no adjusting or slipping.Basically they took what I liked about the last jar opener and added a turning key to hold the jar lid so it unlocks with no slipping every time.Raving fan here."
5,Nice,"This is a really nice set of earrings, they dangle nicley, there were a bit smaller than I'd imagined but they are still very nice earrings."
3,okay,"I'm not that big a fan of U2's song ""Elevation."" I sort of prefer my U2 to be serious. This single is worth picking up for the b-side of ""Don't Take Your Guns to Town,"" which is a laid-back cover of the Johnny Cash song. Nothing revelatory, but a good thing for the die-hard U2 fan to own."
3,Episode listing,The episode listing on this Editorial is incorrect. These episodes are from the previous DVD of 1987. Please correct so I (and others) can know what we are ordering. Thank you.
5,Excellent Seller,Received DVD quickly and brand new. Shipping was fast and dealing with this seller was easy and a smooth transaction. Very pleased with DVD. Will buy again.
4,"Kinda small, but looks great!","Kinda smaller than we expected, but looks great. Then again, maybe my wife knew the size... Praise God Anyway. ;-)."
1,Cheap paper,"I'm disappointed with these. The paper is thin, the pictures have a huge white margin around them, and the colors are pale and faded looking. Also, the artwork isn't that good."
4,Opinion on Mike Harding's book on the Green Man,"I was somewhat disappointed with the photos in this little book. Compared with Harding's book on gargoyles the photos were not as clear and interesting. However, I must admit that the subject is more difficult because it involves more indoor photography which the gargoyles generally did not. My interest is the study of the Green Man in England, Ireland and Scotland and this book covers world wide examples which I certainly appreciate, but are not my interest. The commentary is succinct and entertaining and worth dipping into."
4,Audio version,"I listened to the audio version of the book. I enjoyed it -- there was only one ""F"" word so that was great. Great history and stories."
3,PAPA BRAVO ROMEO,"I am the wife of one of the men mentioned in the book. I did not know that he was being in the book plus not everything said about him is true. My husband recieved the Bronze Star and Purple Heart and as results of the wound he recieved he is a paraglegic. I know there is a disclaimer written but in all fairness to the men mentioned I think they should have been contacted. The book tells of the hardships of the men and what they had to encounter but not all is true. Sorry, if I rub anyone wrong."
1,You Got To Be Kidding,"I served in Nam and Road many a PBR, But This writter was not where I was, I question him even being there. He sounds like a Officer with NO BACK BONE hiding behind a PEN and a Publisher that should have checked his stories prior to print. Where was this guy any book I have ever picked up by PBR or SEA WOLF Vets are just opposite of this mans tales and Boy He Tells some woppers I would like to know what his Brother? PBR guys have to say."
2,ehhhhhh,"While the way the technomages are shown combining guile with technology to was very interesting and almost made the books worth reading, the characters where every terrible marry sue cliche rolled together."
3,Somber Ending to a fine novelized series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"So thats why the series was titled ""The Passing of the Techno Mages."" I'm rather dissapointed! O.K. Volume 1 introduced us to the Mysterious characters that where introduced on the B5 and Crusade t.v. series's. We learn they accomplish their magic with the aid of an alien implant called a chrystalis. Volume 2 We learn the secret history of the alien implants, they come from the Shadows; planners and instigators of chaos and war, eternal enemies of the Vorlons. Volume 3 We learn how the Shadows sadistically produce the chrystalis (by kidnapping different species and letting it grow and fester on them and slowly draining the life out of the host.) Now comes the somber ending, Galen with the help of the spell of destruction and John Sheridan, destroy the homeworld of the Shadows and since the Shadows are the only ones that produce the Tech and the Mages don't know how! It's ""the passing of the Techno Mages"". Kinda dissapointing."
3,Average conclusion for a very good series,"I really liked the first two books in this series, which were amongst the best of the various Babylon 5 books. The last entry looses it a bit though, lavishing a lot of time on a simple re-telling of several episodes from the show, and lacking a solid payoff for all the good work in the previous two volumes. This book kept me hooked, thinking ""hey, not much is happening, but the tension is mounting, we've got to hit the payoff soon ..."", but the final resolution of the Galen's internal conflicts is a serious let-down, more of a slight-of-hand really, a trick befitting a techno-mage who realised she had painted herself into a corner.I suspect any Babylon 5 fan who has read and enjoyed the first two books in the series (as I did) will read this one, and it's certainly not nearly as disappointing as Keyes' ""Final Reckoning"", but there was really only sufficient material here for two books and Cavelos would have done well to leave it at that."
2,Doesn't hold very well,"I purchased this anchor kit along with Flexible Flyer swing set, and installed the anchor kit as directed. The chains were good and tight after installation and the corkscrews were deep in the dirt, but the chains worked themselves loose after about an hour of play. I'm probably going to end up setting the swingset in concrete instead because I can't seem to get these anchors to work for more than a day or two."
5,Easy to install and hold good,These swingset anchors do a very good job at keeping the swingset anchored down. My 8 year old swnt out and played on the swingset very hard and it did not budge.
3,Good Concept,"Product is a good concept, however it is very difficult to get the chain to stay tight, and when the chain loosens, the ring around the leg eventually slides off leaving it useless. I fixed the problem somewhat by putting a bolt through the leg just below the ring. It still loosens a little bit but it serves it's purpose by keeping the legs close to the ground."
1,Don't bother,We purchased this kit for our Flexible Flyer swing set. The corkscrew anchors tend to bend easily if they hit any rocks. They really aren't long enough either. I wish I had just made my own anchor system and saved my money.
1,Not for my soil!,"Ok, so I purchased this to anchor down the swing set that I had purchased for my children. It's probably the type of soil that I have (which is combined sand and dirt) that I could not get these to stay in the ground. Every time I got one of the stakes into the ground, within seconds it was popping right back out. I ended up going to a chain home improvement store and purchasing another anchor set which was a more triangular stake rather than the screw type that came in this kit. I still have this kit, but it's not being used and the pieces are back in the box. Perhaps if you have soil like mine, you'd be better off going to your local store and purchasing an achor set through them."
5,Works great!,"This works exactly for what I needed! I used it for a trampoline instead of a swing set, and it's held steady through some pretty serious storms."
2,"Informative, but very, VERY dry.","This book was assigned for my college course of the same name. It is very dry, and difficult to read. (I'm a 3.9 student, so that should be saying something.) The chapters don't seem to be organized in any particular category and the information seems to be just dumped out in the book. It's all black and white. Very few visuals to provide extra learning opportunities. But still, my biggest complaint is the way the information is presented. It doesn't feel cohesive or linear. There has to be a better textbook out there somewhere...."
4,Delinquency Text,Good text in good condition. Could be in better shape but there's not too much to be expected out of a paperback after it's about a year old. Gets the job done.
4,Excellent Condition,"I purchased two copies of this book and the one that came was in excellent condition like new. The other package was delivered empty and a claim has been make through Amazon to the seller bbspete20 on February 17, 2011. I hope the matter will be resolved soon."
4,Just like new,I bought this book 'almost new' and that was no lie. You can't tell at all that the book is used! I was also able to take advantage of Amazon Prime and got free two day shipping and the book arrived on time. I am very pleased.
3,Lullaby CD,Enjoy the CD although it was not exactly what I was looking for in a lullaby CD. We use this as a back-up when the other one is misplaced
5,Bedtime CD We've Used for 2.5 Years,"I love this CD. I used to play it while nursing my daughter to sleep. 2.5 years later, she's still falling asleep to it every night. I had to reorder it because our original got scratched. It lasts an hour and the music is pleasant enough to hear over and over and over again. Great shower gift!"
2,Don't Expect The Basics,You need a full understanding of customer care before jumping in to this one. I found it to be not very practical unless your the head of customer care for a billion dollar company. Be prepared for theory!
3,Shot on digital video Piranha movie.,"This independent movie is very low budget. Considering how cheap it is, I thought it was pretty good. They obviously had very little money to work with, so don't expect that much from it. Despite the budget, I thought it was very well scored; The techno type music is very well done. There's some cheap gore, no nudity, and a handful of piranhas; and in a funny badly acted scene, a guy on crutches goes into the water and tries to club the fish with his crutches for no reason whatsoever. Some people that are used to seeing these really cheap independent movies might like it, but I wouldn't recommend it to a lot of people."
5,Better Than Piranha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a great horror movie that's much better than Piranha done at a much lower budget filmed in Morgantown West Virginia.It's a must see!!!
1,ORDERED BUT N EVER RECEIVED,Ordered for my hubby for Christmas - NEVER RECEIVED! Will never order from this company again.
2,Cool lights as long as you don't actually put them in water,"I bought a two pack of these lights from my local pond supply shop. They are advertised as being great for in or out of water. They are very neat lights and the colored lenses provide very rich color changes. The only problem is that they are absolutely horrible for in-water use. As the bulb and housing heat up, it will actually cause the glass lens to pop out of place allowing water to enter the housing and submerge the bulb and electrical contacts. This caused numerous burned out bulbs and also fried my transformer completely on more than one occasion, which then had to be replaced. Not to mention I would then have to fish the lenses and color filters out from the bottom of my pond. So like I said, neat lights...as long as you actually never put them in water."
2,Grubby Bitmaps,There are a lot of examples in the book - all of them being presented in unreadable bitmaps. Was this a school project?
4,Excellent reference,"I have almost a dozen books on UML (UML Applied, Shoemaker and UML for the IT Business Analyst, Podeswa are two of my favorites) which I acquired in the process of getting the Object Management Group certification and for use in the SDLC business. This is the book I go back to over and over again. It is not the biggest but it seems to have more hard facts about modeling packed into one volume than any other I have. The knowledge is well organized and succinct. In many cases when I was studying for the UML exam, I searched for the answer to a question in several of the UML books in my library before I found it this tome. As a UML evangelist I believe the language can be a rich and powerful expression not only of business software but also of any business process. This book is a great tool in using UML as a means of communication"
4,My cat pissed all over this book.,"I still kept it though, since it's good. It's on my desk at work. I blame the reek on the graduates."
3,Good book a perfer the pocket verison,Not a bad bood by any sense of the word but it is sort of intermediate. It doesn't provide a good introduction to UML you really need more pictures It is sort of hard to use as a reference but it expands on the subject in good detail. I read it cover to cover and learned somethings but I never have had the need to go back and read anything over. Books on computer technology should not be so disposable.
2,Do not buy for kindle,"If you plan to read this on a kindle... Don't bother. The images are too low resolution, lines are missing, and sinceUML is all about the graphs, makes it pretty useless as a reference. Maybe hard copy is better?"
2,Ho-hum,"Even without the controversy, A Million Little Pieces was a big let down. Frey is not half the writer he seems to think he is: the prose is clumsy, mawkish and talks more about the authors pleading need to be accepted, than it does about his 'recovery'. ""Digging the Vein"" was a similar book that came out right at the same time, which offered a rage filled altenative to the traditional AA-inspired recovery memoirs. It boggles my mind that frey's book had the success it did, while ""Digging..."" has so far flown beneath the radar. Just goes to show you that Oprah may be good at interviewing celebrities, but when it comes to literature she's pretty clueless."
1,Busted!,"When the New York Times discovered that one of its reporters, Jayson Blair, fabricated stories, they rightfully retracted his articles and fired him. So why won't Doubleday recall Frey's memoir, which, according to the Smoking Gun, is loaded with fabricated stories and ficticious accounts? Is money really more important than principle? Is craft more important than integrity? I saw this bozo on Larry King, and he looked guilty as sin. As for Oprah, who endorsed this book, she should be ashamed of herself. I, for one, refuse to reward an author who has no respect for honesty and integrity. I'll be giving my money to a more worthy author."
2,A million little fragmented ideas,"Well, the first half of the book held my interest, but this story had such a fatal drop after that, ugh, total boredom. I couldn't even finish the book. The colorful description of having a root canal ""sans novocaine"" was pretty interesting and that's about it. I feel the drug use must have affected the authors sense of recall and storytelling........ Was expecting something more based on the reviews and hype I had been reading in the media about this book (as were all the other reviewers here, it seems). If you can get your hands on ""Twisted: Inside The Mind of a Drug Addict"" by Carl Adam Richmond, it's a much better read."
2,truly disappointing,"i found this book very engaging because it was labeled a memoir but after the author admitted that he lied about the contents of the book, I must say that had I known that the events were made up, I would not have found them as gripping. I am also personally disappointed that he felt he had to mislabel his book. As a work of fiction, it's not very compelling."
2,Pieces of Terminal Uniqueness,"This book is readable, but it seemed more like an after-school special, where the poor little rich kid gets hooked on the pipe. In his quest for terminal-uniqueness, James Frey falls short in his gratitude that he's lucky to be alive. An ego-centric fella, I'm sure Mr. Frey is awaiting his Oscar nominated script and is visualizing Johnny Depp playing himself.I put this book down and I feel like it's fallen short. That I have been cheated and it just somehow doesn't ring true to me. I want to read the story of Lilly. In her brief appearance, she has struck a cord in my heart and I yearn to know her just a little bit more.This is probably the first graphical account of drug use that Oprah has ever read, and it's poor at best. I highly recommend books like ""Permanent Midnight"" ""Scar Tissue"" and ""The Dirt"" over this ho-hum account."
2,Oprah's Fools Club,"I try to avoid any book recognized by Oprah, and within the mainstream, but I thought I would give this one a chance for a change. BIG MISTAKE!As I read, some of Mr. Frey's drug/alcohol induced episodes seemed too ""hyper-fantastic"" to be coming from a memoir. I thought to myself: ""This has to be fiction!"" Sure enough, the truth came out....My quick review:Bad prose, inaccurate facts, fabricated story, and the book is promoted by Oprah, supposedly one of the most highly regarded literary critics in the nation. Need I say more?"
2,Why are we glorifying a guy who jumped the system?,"Does anyone else think it's wrong that James Frey didn't serve time for the crimes he committed before he went into rehab? His mob and judge friends got him off the hook--enabling him to serve 6 months in jail instead of several years in prison. While this book was a page turner, I find it disturbing that we're glorifying (and making rich) a guy who jumped the system. He may even have been a murderer--something he never clarifies. I would respect James had he served the consequences for what he did, and actually shown some remorse for his disgusting behavior. To me, that's as much a part of rehab as getting off the substances. Instead, he wrote 22 pages of his ""sins"" and then burned them--I guess that was his payment? But this is a guy who thinks he's above everything, including the rehab program he was in. He really is his own God. People like that scare me, and it scares me that our culture is so oblivious."
1,Unsatisfied,"I began reading this book with an open mind. I really wanted to like it, but the further I got into the story the more annoyed I became. I kept waiting for it to get better and for the plot to develop, but was disappointed on both accounts. All of the characters are too extreme and stereotypical. Because the stories are so unbelievable the author has no credibility. Even though I tried, I did not care for James and can't imagine how others could relate to him. He seems like a self-centered spoiled kid. I definitely do not recommend this book; reading it was a waste of time."
3,Intense Memoir,"Fascinating, riveting, and sometimes brutal description of the authors visit to rehab. This book has also increased my love for coffee"
3,a million little embellishments,i recedived this book months ago and still have not read more than 20 pgs. the controversy surrounding this book has had something to do with it.
4,Eye opening,"If the reader is forgiving and can get beyond the constant use of one vulgarity, this book is a guided tour through the sad world of substance abuse. Frequent choppy descriptions help provide smaller doses of the author's plight and occasional relief can be found in the love story."
1,Don't believe the hype,I knew even before the Oprah scandal that a root canal without pain relief (solely because of a drug addiction) was unreasonable and absolutely untrue. Many forms of pain relief are non-narcotic. This book insults all recovering addicts working a 12-step program. Too bad I wasted my money.
1,Not the new addiction Bible...,"This entire book makes me think is that James Frey is a self-important ass, who has a very poor writing style. I work at a prominent substance abuse facility, and have been in treatment myself. It pains me that substance abuse and dependency patients are reading this and thinking that this is their rehab Bible, because if you behave the was Mr. Frey behaved you would be booted out on your ass. Withdrawals or not, physical or verbal abuse towards other patients or staff cannot be tolerated. For all these comments about how truthful and upfront this book is, you are naive if you think that this memoir is anything other than very bad fiction."
1,Million little pieces,"Should have been a ""Million Little Lies"" James Frey.He write a fictional novel that is rejected by 17 publishing houses and then on his last attempt changes the context and make the novel a memoir. The book is filled with over exaggerated, vulgar and macho egos of the wild minded Frey.The book was very capturing as a memoir, and very disappointing as a fictional novel.He makes up a story contrived from what I can only believe as a wild imagination and over exaggerations of others lives.He gets to the heart of the reader with love, death and a against all odds of fighting addiction.He convinces true addicts that if the have the will they can conquer the demons. After finding out these memoirs were fictional I felt ripped of and betrayed by the author and his greed to deceive his readers and fellow authors as well as lead true addicts down the road to self-destruction."
1,Pathetic,"If it were true, it would be life-changing.Since it is not true, yet referred to as a memoir, it is appalling.I don't appreciate being lied to."
1,A Million Little Lies....,"Yes, it is a riveting book and yes, James Frey is a wonderful writer. Unfortunately, he ""embellished"" many key points of his so-called ""memoir"". Most notably, he claimed to have spent months in jail. In truth, as revealed by smokingun.com, he only spent a few hours in jail! And no, he never underwent dental surgery without painkillers. Which begs the question ""How much of his memoir are based on actual memories?"". Finally, as much as I want to read the sequel to his first novel, I won't buy it until it is re-classified as Fiction or states ""loosely based on a true story""."
1,"Here are some Things that You, the Prospective Buyer, should Know","* The author has a, let's say, ""unique"" writing style. I'd suggest finding a passage, or three, and reading them. Who knows, you might find his style sufficiently engaging, creative, or novel enough to enjoy. As you can likely guess, I was not a fan.* Speaking of ""novel,"" your knowledge of a single critical thing about this book will forever color your perception of it: It is almost entirely false. A number of websites have touched on this issue far better than I could hope to, but just bear in mind that this book is a novel, not a memoir.* This book was written, it would appear, in an effort to make the reader cry as much as possible. Relentless attempts to make me like a character only to kill him off didn't suit my tastes, but you may find it enjoyable."
1,"Lies, Lies, Lies.","I tried reading this book after my girlfriend recommended it to me. I was enthralled by it at first, because of how shocking the storyline is, but by page 50 my ""b.s. detector"" was ringing and by page 100 it was howling so badly that I had to throw the thing down. I just talked to a friend about it who told me that the book is in fact a bunch of lies and that I should check out the thesmokinggun.com. I cannot believe this guy didn't expect to get caught. Reading this book for me was like listening to an eight year old boy brag about his adventures as a macho dragon slayer. James Frey claims he read Don Quixote in prison, maybe what he meant to say is that he is imprisoned in Don Quixote. This guy should be seriously ashamed of himself. He's right about being a ""Criminal,"" (which he capitalize in such a poetic way) but not the cool type of criminal that he wants to be. He's pathetic and he owes a lot people a lot of money and an explanation. Visit the smoking gun dot com!"
1,A Million Little Pieces,I was impressed with James Frey on OPhra and very dissapointed in his book. The language was offensive to me and it distracted me from reading the book. People have commented as to how the book has helped them with their addictions and I was interested in sharing this with people that have those problems. But just could not get through the first chapter because of the offensive language. I am also dissappointed in Ophra for referring this book. As a Christian I have a problem with the book.
4,Surprising Degradation,This is usually not my type of read but this book will not leave my hands. I almost didn't read it when I figured out what it was about but am glad that I did. It's VERY educational and eye-opening. It deals with so many different areas of sickness. I would recommend this book but not to the faint of heart.
4,Loved it,"I read this book because of the criticism surrounding it. I fell in love with this book despite the negative comments. While people hate it for its lack of credibility, just remember: How much truth can a crack head tell???"
3,Fiction or Nonfiction?,"After being rejeted by many publishers, J.Frey decided to call this story a factual recount of his experience. Well, we all know what happened next. If you can get beyond his discussions of truth and honesty and the idea that any ""facts"" in this piece are either not true or questionable, then you'll might just enjoy the story. It is poetic at times in the way that he gets into the mind of an addict. It's an enjoyable FICTIONAL ride. How important is truth when you are a drug addict?"
2,I don't appreciate lies....,Maybe this book would be better if it wasn't a pack of lies to make money. Lack of integrity on the writer's part really ruins a work.
1,A nice piece of fiction,"I was really touched by this ""memoir"" until thesmokinggun.com burst my bubble. Now I feel sucker punched. A book can't qualify as a memoir if huge chunks are a fictional re-telling of events. I don't care what Oprah says or how many people she claims this fabricated story has helped. Frey is a fraud and a huge (and now rich) disappointment."
1,Depressing-Not Worth 1 Star,"Since I'm not a drug addict, I cannot say if this would be any benefit to someone with dependency issues, however since it seems to promote Mr. Frey's ""superhuman"" ability - and dishonors any proven establishment (medical, psychological or spiritual), I'd say it's a disservice to them. Mr. Frey was brought up with a sibling in a nice house with parents who were happily married and well-traveled. Seems to me that he took advantage of them and now wants to simply whine on paper. For me, it was a waste of time and money. There's enough depressing stuff in the world. Most of Oprah's selections are worth the effort, so I stuck through this one until the end and still can't stop shaking my head. Marley and Me would have been a much better choice, Oprah. Sorry. The only thing this book did is make the author/liar, Mr. Frey, a richer man."
2,"Shocking, but not likeable","I read this before all the controversy started, and my opinion hasn't really changed. As I read it, I kind of had a suspicion that things would turn out as they have. Frey seemed like a spoiled rich kid, trying to show everyone that he was ""badder"" and ""tougher"" than he really was. When I saw that he had admitted just that, I was not surprised.The book is written in an interesting way, and I guess it's interesting, but I couldn't enjoy it because I disliked the narrator/author. I was hoping that he would have changed in some way (other than not drinking) by the end of the book, but that didn't happen."
1,ALL LIES + BS * Oprah = A million little BUCKS,He's full of it. He lied. Oprah's so-called book club endorsed this cr8p and now he's rich and famous. I say protest this book!!!!!!
2,"Yawn. Another addict, same story.","Author rediscovers a formula: generic addiction + whining + teenage rants + targeted publicity= a ""voice of a generation"" book.Ignore the hype. Tales of addiction have been done better by others: Permanent Midnight, Jerry Stahl; Junky, William Burroughs; Basketball Diaries, Jim Carroll.Skip on the book and read the interviews with the author. They are more fascinating especially if you're the type drawn to scenes of car crashes and other mishaps.When the book is eclipsed by the story of the author then the book begs closer scrunity.In the naked text without the buzzing hype or the author's testerone fueled rants the story revealed itself for what it was: another story of addiction with promise which sank to the predictable.A story with a hint of substanceBut lacking."
4,I could not put it down,"I read the book in a translation, in rumanian language, and read it during a long weeked, could not go out, could not put it down.Weather it was true or not at all, does not matter to me: the ashtonishing style got me finally but mostly the main caracter and his thinking, courage and tale, and that of the others. The friendship, help.I find that it is a great book.A Million Little Pieces"
2,No Big Deal,"I agree with other reviews that the story was not that original.. Even if the book was a little made up.. the made up story was not that big of deal. I applaud the guy for beating his addiction, but I did not find the story that moving. He did write well, and it seemed real(in short phrases to keep the story moving - how an addict may think) -james stated on Oprah. Maybe it was his perspective of how he told his own story that was not intriguing to me...Although, I do understand how this story can be so moving to someone in a situation like his... ""hold on"""
1,Would not take the time to read,I wish I could get back the time I spent reading what I did of this book. I have worked in mental health & this book does not seem real. This is about the 5th review I have written - let's see if Amazon will have the guts to post it. Amazon has discarded all my previous reviews. But the word needs to get out there about this book. don't waste your time or money on it.
2,A million little pieces,"I read this book BEFORE all of the controversy. Far too desperate from the first page to the last page whether you thought it was true or knew that it was not. This book could not be marketed as a novel for the simple fact that it was not believable. In order to make it believable, the reader had to be duped into believing that it was all true. I simply believe that there should be truth in marketing so that each individual can decide what they choose to read or not to read."
3,"I don't usually read novels, but....","This book attracted so much media attention, that I could not help myself. I found it interesting, I always seem to find other people's lives interesting. I don't really see the relevance of it's fiction/non-fiction classification. For years we have all read both, does it really matter whether Classics such as ""Flowers for Algernon"", ""Of Mice and Men"", ""Othello"", etc., were 100% true, fiction or fabricated partially? I say no. All in all a decent book that will draw many a reader, and hold their attention until the end. At least that is how I felt. Thanks James Frey."
1,If you like fiction,"Great read if you like fiction but I found out, after I read the book, that he admitted it was total fiction. Since I don't like to read fiction, it was a waste of time and money for me"
4,Believable BUT,"I enjoyed reading this book but had one major problem with it. I do not believe the ""dentist episode."" It reminded me of NAZI Germany and we do live in the United States."
1,Lies Matter,"To those who say it doesn't matter whether the book is fact or fiction: it mattered to Frey, it mattered to his publisher and it mattered to Oprah. And it matters to most readers too.-The book was rejected by many publishers as a work of fiction (which it apparently is, in substantial part). Only got accepted once he labelled it (falsely) non-fiction-Labelling it non-fiction was representing to the reader that ""this actually happened"".-Frey compounded his lies by going on Oprah and elsewhere to sell his book and discussing his ""experiences""--some of which never actually happened.On Oprah (whose selection of the book sold more than a million copies) Frey talked about all his personal struggles. Do you think for a moment he would have been picked by Oprah, and invited on, if he'd admitted he made up key events in the book?"
1,I'm Disgusted By The People Who Think Lying Is OK,"Would you also think it is ok for your child to commit plagiarism while writing a research paper for school, or to fabricate information on a resume because it sounds better, or claim deductions on your taxes that you should not claim? I know many people do these things but that doesn't make it acceptable. In an age of false wars, Enron accounting, and fake newspaper articles, has everyone in this country completely lost their scruples? How revolting! If Frey was going to 'embellish' or write from his fantasies, why not just call it fiction. To inject himself into other's drama and capitalize on their misery makes Frey nothing more than a bottom feeder."
1,He scammed liberals,"This book has been exposed as a complete and total lie. If Oprah Winfrey has any self respect, she will apologize to her John Kerry supporter fans. I predict that she will just laugh all the way to the bank with your money. Wake up, reject socialism, learn to think for yourself."
1,Total and absolute crap.,I read both books twice and now I want my money back. You people are missing the most important fact; if he lied about the arrests he probably lied about a great deal of other things as well.I think Frey is a con-artist and his parents should be ashamed of themselves too.
1,Full O' Crap,"This book is contrived and his ordeal is pure fiction as any low-level substance abuser will tell you. Proves my theory, Oprah is full of crap and was easily duped by this bs artist. I went through High School in the mid 70's and encountered dozens of kids with better real stories than this. He can't talk the talk and anyone who has been through it or had a family member go through it can see right through this jackass."
1,One big piece of crap,"I have bought a lot of books that I subsequently didn't really enjoy: that's the risk you take, right? But not once, ever, have I felt this cheated out of the money I paid for a book. I remember thinking at the beginning 'it's a real shame that memoirs are sometimes written by terrible writers, because it doesn't matter how stunning their story, it sometimes read like crap.' Oh, right. It is crap. I didn't buy the book direct from Random House so I won't be elligible for a refund. I might send it back to them all the same. It's stinking up my bookshelf."
1,Everyone Deserves a Refund,"Right from the very first page you can tell this book is not a real account. He's on a plane drunk, with a badly torn up face, swollen shut eyes, dripping blood, and covered in vomit and urine? No airline would let a passenger on in that condition!Also, if you've seen Frey in real life, you know he doesn't look like someone who's been through what he claims he has. He should look like a hundred miles of bad road---he doesn't.Oprah defended the book on Larry King when the author was on tonight. The problem with Oprah's defense is that since it is a work of fiction, Frey's ""personal story"" cannot be used as a source of inspiration to others in their struggles with addiction. His edict to ""hold on"" doesn't hold water when his account of what he went through was a figment of his overactive imagination."
1,A complete hoax,"Go to www.thesmokinggun.com and see for yourself. I had no choice but to throw it away when I was finished. The author made it all up, and is a complete fraud. Is it a good story of redemption... you bet it is. But the sad truth is, it's a story completely made up..."
1,FRAUD!!!!!!,Shame on James Frey for marketing this fraudulent book as non-fiction. And shame on Oprah Winfrey for trying to use her clout to protect this so-called author so as to not tarnish her little book club. Puh-lease!!! Thank God for refunds.
1,"embellished ""a little""???","What are you on, dude? Read the police reports - this guy wrote a piece of fiction, loosely based on doing the same kind of crap most of us did when we were young and portrayed himself as a bad boy ex-con. Oooo, so dangerous! Who cares about the $12... the time spent reading... but call a fraud a fraud when they show up."
5,Wonderful and difficult read,"Very Very GOOD BOOK!!! I couldn't put it down and wanted more when the book was finished. Once you get into the flow of the book it is impossible to put down. There were parts that were difficult to read (very discriptive) but I believe it wouldn't be as good of a book if it was missing those parts! It is the true face of addiction...the good, the bad, and the ugly! James Frey does an excellent job of bringing the reader into the book and making you feel as though you are there witnessing it all. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has dealt with addiction or had a family member dealing with addiction. In fact I would highly recommend this book to anyone even interested in the ins and outs of addiction. WONDERFUL READ!!!"
3,Decent,"Although much of this so-called true story has been discredited, A Million Little Pieces is still a decent read. Let me warn readers first by letting them know that the author uses absolutely no quotations marks which can be very annoying when you don't know which character is speaking. But moving beyond this, Frey does a decent job with character development and his writing is good too. The storyline becomes repetitive at times, but there are moments where you definitely feel the dark and lonely emotions that the author felt through his painful days of treatment. This book is probably a great read for anyone with a drug problem or a curiosity for the shadowed lives of addicts."
3,mediore pagetuner,So much didn't ring true to me: Crystal Meth user in the early 80's? The root canal scene? The flight to the rehab? The uncanny detail and recollections? Alas It was indeed a page turner and so much did hit home and have a real smell - from my secondary expereinces with rehabs. I would recommend this book (among others) to someone who has a loved one headed to or in rehab as an insight.
5,Incredible,"This book was incredible. I loved every page of it. I like how Frey presented the stories, the experiences, etc. It made me sob, think, laugh, ponder, cringe, and embrace the journey of the book. Get over the controversy and let yourself become addicted to the writing of Frey."
2,Could barely get through it,"I was reading this for book club. There are some interesting parts of it, but I was disgusted so much of the time that I couldn't read more than 10 or 15 pages without putting it down."
2,A Million Little Pieces book,"Shame on the publishers for classifying this book as nonfiction. I read the book months after the ""gotta read this book"" hoopla in addition to the scandal;and concluded that only a dullard would think the author actually experienced some of the experiences. Besides the dentist visit, the idea of a couple social workers allowing an institutionalized person rescue someone from a drug house is simply ludicrous."
1,A total fraud.,"It's a pity that Mr. Frey lied through and through in his book and that the public bought it hook, line and sinker. The law enforcement personnel mentioned in this book show that there is nothing behind the author's claims. The families of the victims mentioned in this book deny any knowledge of this person. There is no historical, actual, or witnessed fact in this piece of self-pitying fiction. It surprises me how a person can degrade himself for a publisher's millions. As Einstein famously wrote: ""There are two things that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity. And I'm not sure about the former.""A pox upon Mr. Frey and his enabler Oprah."
2,NOTHING TO RAVE ABOUT,"I was reading this book when all of the controvery started. To be honest, didn't think the book was all that true or not true."
4,Interesting but unbelievable,I found the first part of the book dull not writing in sentences. I couldn't believe that everything that was in the book was true as I read it because my Son had been in rehabilitation and had an addiction problem longer than the author and didn't go through anything like that nor was he treated like the author. I also didn't like the fact that he was against AA because that is a tremendous help to alcholics. My Son has helped many people through AA and people should be encouraged to use that program. To bad the book was found out to be full of lies.
2,eh......,I purchased this book after Frey was ousted as writing ure fiction. It did not bother me if it were fiction as long as it would have been a good read. Frankly I found it boring.
1,A Disgrace,"This book is a disgrace. And I am not even referring to the fact that is a novel and not a memoir, although I find it impossible that anybody who has flown a commericial airline would believe the first 3 pages of this book on face value.I am appalled at James Frey's writing. He borders on the illiterate. This book is so poorly written it astounds me. He has no grasp of the English language whatsoever. He is perpetuating a crisis that we currently have in this country by not using even minimal punctuation or grammar skills - no wonder why the illiteracy rate is so high!He is a spoiled boy of privilege who is trying to build himself up to something he is not. And he is an insult to anyone who struggles in the recovery of addiction.I am simply horrified that anyone with half a brain thinks this book is good and he is a good writer. Horrified and appalled."
2,A Million Little Pieces,A Million Little Pieces never finished. Slightly disappointed in this book after oprah recommended it to everyone to read. Then later changed her mind.
3,*SPOILER ALERT* It was okay but...,"There is no question it is a moving story of recovery with a deeply sympathetic protagonist. However, after learning that the story is fiction (therefore, a hoax), the impact is somewhat lessened and a sense of unreality tends to pervade the story. I would recommend not learning anything about the book while you are reading it or go in with a complete enlightened mind and, thus, avoid disappointment. Although if you have read this review, before having read the book, that's unavoidable."
1,B.S.,"Shame on the author, Shame on Oprah for being unable to say she was deceived too and continuing to endorse the book, but most of all shame on Anchor -the publishing house- for not having the integrity of calling things by its name: a lie.Anchor should be boicotted for its disregard for the truth and lack of respect for its readers."
1,I Have a Headache Now,"I tried reading this book in its entirety. I developed a headache after only a few chapters. I could look over the fact that his grammar is like a child's if his stories were completely true. I do enjoy a good ""truth is stranger than fiction"" story. But let's face it. His stories were mostly fabricated and his writing style is that of staccato rambling. I'm moving on to a better book already."
1,Angry book by an angry man,"I hated this book. I wanted to read it because a have a couple of family members with addiction problems who recovered on their own without AA. The author's style of writing is terrible and I think his story could have been told just as well without the choppy sentences and probably a record number of F words in any book I have ever read. I also don't beleive the story of the dental procedures done without any novocane. Sounds like something from ""Marathon Man"". If he had had a ruptured appendix, would they have removed it without any anesthesia? A person can go into shock from pain and I have never heard of the use of novocane triggering any relapse in an addict. After all, it is injected into the nerve, not the bloodstream."
1,It's funny...,"when you realize that 85% of what he wrote is completely fabricated from his own imagination. Remember folks, he writes fiction."
2,Frey,"I only bought this book because of Oprah, once I realized I was reading fiction, I have a new perspective on this book. Not bad for fiction."
2,boring!,"Kept turning the pages as if I was going to get it!! on the next page.....Can't always believe OPRA, can we??"
1,oprah's failed book and exposure,"After rading the book twice , the first time I was enthralled....but the second time, It was just plain arrogant and undoubtedly fiction.This is one of oprah's other shams(I don't know how the ratings are, but it seems she still wants money...AND SHE WAS NAMED NUMBER ONE ICON OF THE CENTURY BY A TV PROGRAM!)also just finding out the guy James didn't even go to jail! Who knows if everything else is a lie, just to make a couple extra bucks for oprah to retire on.Though suspenseful throughout the story, you want to find out what happens to the guy. Any book that is passed as nonfiction and later revealed as fiction doesn't deserve any audience because only honest authors should accomplish anything.But as long as there is women over the age 20 with nothing else to do but clean the house and be a tired old housewifes, oprah's still gonna have an audience."
4,recovery -,"I was so relieved when I came across this book. 4 moths ago I attended the same treatmet facility as Frey in Minnesota. This institution is, perhaps, the devil. The reason this book is important is that it familiarizes people with 12 step recovery treatment, a treatment backed by medical professionals, and this 12 step treatment philosophy for me, Frey, and many other intellectually sound people, is the largest roadblock to stayinng sober. 12 step recovery may work for some, but when it is touted as the only way, people who are unable to accept its illegitimate claims will lose, and do so feeling ashamed - ashamed that they couldnt just believe in this system, however wrong it may be. Its tragic. Its the institution. its our failure to understand the actual mechanics of alcohol abuse. You will hear that 12 step recovery is a simple program for complex people. An alteration: 12 Step recovery is a simple program for simple people. I am angry, so angry."
3,ok... but,"James Frey's writing style is Just Plain Annoying. I Hate all of the capitals. But more than that I hated it's faux spiritual take on addiction, and I hated its self aggrandizing and chest beating. A book which came out at the same time and recieved non of this books publicity was called ""Digging The Vein"". The author, Tony O'Neill could write rings around James Frey and was more fully aligned with the Burroughs / Bukowski / Miller style of roman a clef that Frey claimed to write. I'd take Digging the Vein over A Million Little Pieces in a new york minute. but there's no accounting for taste, i suppose. Just look at how succesful Dave Eggars is."
1,"lies, lies and more lies","As a recovering addict and alcoholic myself - female - 47 years old - I had seen Mr Frey's intereview on Oprah when it was on a month or so ago and I could really relate to a lot of what he said. But, now after these allegations came out and to find out that he embellished ""parts"" of his memoir makes me totally doubt if he even had any problems with addiction at all. Could he have gone to rehab as a writer to gather information for this book ? Might have happened. I had planned on getting this book, now I wouldn't read it if someone gave it to me. He makes a mockery out of the TRUE recovery process and the pain and suffering that we encounter. I, for one, don't believe that he was even and addict at all."
2,HE MADE IT UP?? THE TABLOID BABY DIDN'T HAVE TO LIE!,"The standard for a memoir should be the TRUTH.Burt Kearns wrote Tabloid Baby, his memoir of alcoholic degradation, journalistic domination, and eventual salvation, and every word was true.He inspired millions with his story.And as with Mr. Frey, I was moved by the book because I knew IT WAS TRUE.This infraction costs the book three stars.(...)"
2,Sad indeed!,"I struggled through this book filled with horrific descriptions of agony and suffering, simply because I thought it was true! In fact, I frequently told myself that no one could make up something this attrocious! Essentially, it's the only way I was able to endure the entire book. As I turned the pages, I found myself wondering how he could possibly remember the details so clearly, given the fact he was out-of-his-head much of the time. Midway through the book, my husband asked if it was a good book, and I explained that if it were a fictional story, the author couldn't write himself out of a wet paper bag, so in a word, I described it as ""sad."" Turns out the ""sad"" part is that I paid good money for this drivel!"
1,Buyers Beware,"A total ""wannabe"" ive been a addict for 35yrs. This James Frey is a gutless man,in the likes of a Cliford Irving. Freys putdown of a.a. shows what a loser-liar-punk he is."
5,Highly Recommended and unique writing style,"I loved this book and James Frey's unique writing style. As a child and sibling to a drug addict and alcoholic I found James recovery to be realistic and found myself with some understanding of the difficulty one may face to live a clean life and face emotions head on without covering them up with mind altering substances.Although it has come out that some of the book is fiction I found many parts believeable and rooting for James to make it in life and to tackle his addictions and overcome his old ways of pulling away from those he loves and not facing his emotions.I also found James Frey's writing style very refreshing! His style tends to show intense feelings and vulnerability. The book was an easy read that I could not put down and was anxious to read the next book that follows ""My Friend Lenord"". Highly recommended!!"
5,Captivating.. absolutly remarkable,"This book has you at the first line. this book gives a new meaning to the term ""page turner"". I could not put this book down! You cry, you laugh, you smile. A truly inspiring real life story written from the heart of a true survivor of abuse and addiction."
3,A frightening glimpse into the darkest side of self-loathing,"A frightening glimpse into the darkest side of self-loathing and self abuse. In simple, unadorned language Frey recounts his time spent at a rehab clinic recovering from crack-cocaine and heavy drug addiction. The stories are nightmarish - in raw language Frey probes the perimeters of his pitch black womb of suffering. A lifelong victim of his own propensity toward the self-destructive common in young adults, the author recalls how he had to decide how to turn over a new leaf and put the pieces of his life back together. The prose can be frustratingly jumbled and repetitive at times, but the gravity of the subject matter carries the story along in addition to an uncertain romantic relationship Frey has in the hospital with a girl called Lily. A Million Little Pieces is tear envoking and will make you think twice before ever feeling sorry for yourself again."
1,Never again will I Iisten to Oprah!,"My mom heard all the hype about this book and rushed out and bought copies for everyone she thought would want one. She didn't even get half-way through it and I have to say I'm still struggling trying to finish it. If you have a weak stomach (constantly describing bodily fluids) or are offended by profanity (often uses the f-word) or enjoy correct grammar or punctuation (he uses none throughout), skip it.I would never have bought anything solely because it was recommended by Oprah anyway, I already made that mistake with rushing to the theater to see ""Crash"", she said, ""If you see one movie this year, see Crash!"" I say, if you want to enjoy what you're reading or watching, skip Oprah's advice!"
1,Book Is A Waste Of Money,For a man who is supposed to be so educated he didn't realize that a memoir wasn't supposed to be made up of lies. To the people who wasted their money on this book I feel sorry for you. I borrowed it from the library and am glad to not have bought it. Because of his lies how do we know the rest of the book even happened. I wonder if he was even an addict at all. I watched the Oprah show where people who were addicts were given advice from this guy. He knew from the beginning about the lies but wasn't man enough to step forward and change the items. Not to worry though Karma has a way of fixing things. He will get what he deserves and I hope it slams him hard. To this day the jerk doesn't feel he has done anything wrong that he needs to apologize for.
1,Read a Real Memoir Instead,"Read this book as fiction, for that's what it is. If you want to read a real memoir, read ""The Glass Castle: A Memoir"" by Jeannette Walls."
5,astounding,"it really hits close to home when you know someone struggling with drugs and alcohol, even if its not nearly as bad as james' encounters it really moves you to try and motivate them to do something to turn their life around and really inspires you to stay clean when you hear of all his ordeals"
2,"good, but.........",I'm a recovering alcoholic with 5+ sobriety. The book lacks the main solution to recovery. A spiritual awakening with the Lord God. The Author of sobriety and Life - both here and eternally.
5,awareness,"Could I have truely understood addiction through any other means than this? Only if I was an addict. I have seen drug addiction, had friends who are addicts, have asked questions to recovering addicts. Only an addict can truely understand. But for all of us who want to understand this book brings you the closest step without actually using. Mr. Frey, I thank you"
2,Overlong and Overdone,"Whether I am wrong or not, I didn't believe half of this book. The characters and situations seem a bit too ""stock"", and Frey seems to love building himself up as this tough guy whom everybody eventually fears. If Frey had cut this book down by half, I think it would have been a smoother read. The ""love scenes"" between Frey and Lilly bring any action in the book to a screeching halt, and the final scene between them seems to be cribbed from an 80s teen flick. What starts off as such a promising read became for me an endless one, and I had to stop halfway through because I was growing very tired of Frey. By the end of the book, I didn't even like him. Read, but with reservations."
4,He wasn't lying about the Dave Eggers thing.,"Reading this book I can't help but be reminded of all the parallels between literature and music. Frey has rhythm. And melodies. And poignant silence.The first thing I heard about this book was a quip regarding Dave Eggers, and how James Frey could write circles around him. I was intrigued, first because I found Eggers so totally pretentious that I couldn't get past page 5 of A Heartbreaking Work.., and second because I was thrilled that someone else didn't subscribe to the dominant trend of Eggers glorification.This is a story about addiction and recovery, and a man who has the good fortune to receive the best treatment the country has to offer. Lucky for us, he has enough brains to challenge the system and think for himself, not blindly accepting the prescribed path. It's about breaking out of our hard shells, whether they've been formed by addictions or hate or what have you."
1,This Book Sucks!,"I just want to say that this book was an utter waste of my time. I didn't even finish it...If it's not getting interesting by page 200 then ""chuck it"". I'm a voyeur, who isn't? I love a good biography.However, I think I can honestly say that this is one idiot that I don't have any interest in knowing about. Screw Oprah's Book Club.I understand the whole addict thing...my family and friends to name a few...But, come on. Get a clue dude and stop screwing around in rehab when ""it's your only chance left"" Boo-Hoo James Frey....This is one book that we could all burn and it would be okay..."
1,"I tried to like it, I really did...","I really like the story and was pulling for James Frey and all the other characters in the book, however, the way it is written is so bad. I thinkg the writer indulged a bit. I dont think a lot of key points in the book are truthful. He repeats so many sentences dozens of times, as if he was trying to make a 430 page book with a 200 page story. I never write book reviews, but I felt so strongly about how I Felt about this book to give one. I understand he was trying to emphasize how he (his character felt), but honestly enough with the fury fury fury fury want want want need need need. I never write book reviews, but I Felt so strongly about how I Felt about this book to give one. I never write book reviews, but I felt so strongly about how I Felt about this book to give one. I never write book reviews, but I Felt so strongly about how I Felt about this book to give one.You get the point, its freaking annoying!"
4,12 steps ain't for everyone!,"I bought the book after hearing about all the lying. I thought, the story line would not have held the publisher's interest had he thought it was a work of fiction. His true story might not have been published but his telling of his story combined with other's he might have heard in rehab is powerful. If I gave this to someone who was an addict they might better identify with the character, someone who comes into the center knowing he won't make it and leaves just 6 weeks later with hope. The fact that the 12 steps for him, the higher power ends up being himself, not God that helps him is something many agnostic or atheist addicts might better identify with. I think the realization that the better clinics in the world have something less than a 20% success rate is horrifying. As a society, we better rid this stuff off the streets sooner than later. I liked the book a lot. I learned a lot. I found the lack of grammar added to the story."
4,read it for what it is and you may enjoy this book more,"For all of you who are coming down so hard on Frey, how many of you have actually been drug addicts?? Seen, felt, or experienced what he described in his memoir?? MAYBE a fourth of you. You claim you've asked other people who supposedly know more about the circumstances than he does...What makes your source more believeable than him?? Because YOU know them?? You can't fight or condemn something when you have no personal basis to argue from. Would you have enjoyed it more and looked at it with a more open mind had it been placed in the fiction section?? Probably so.The bottom line is A Million Little Pieces is a remarkable and beautiful account of what a human being can do when they believe in themselves and believe they have something to live for, and also shows it's never too late to change and improve if you truly desire to. Fiction or non-fiction, exagerrated or straight-to-the-point, it's heart-wrenching, raw, and inspirational."
1,Foul Language,"I was really shocked by the language in this book. I put it down and decided not to finish it. No matter if the ""story"" is good, the language was too awful to go through."
1,Don't Care,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. Not only was it boring, but he doesn't know how to write. He has no soul, gives no reason to care about him and left me feeling a little nauseated. I've seen it all before, selfish people abusing people over and over again. I was hoping he would just disappear and leave everyone alone."
5,"Since he didn't live it, I don't have to read it to review it -- take that integrity!","I'd like to tell you another true story about redemption and strife. A lofted character raised on high, teetering with excess and frailty. Unaware of his plight which caused those around him such anguish, he tipped and tilted, wobbled and spun, precariosly close to the abyss. When at last feeling vindicated and secure the impending doom befell him. Caught between heaven and hell, falling through the space of a dark abyss, drugged and screaming, he crashed.And all the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put humpty dumpty back together again."
5,"Howard Marks' Mr. Nice on Crack,Coke, Glue and Meth","Tired of soft core E True Hollywood BS? Go to the Million Little Pieces web site for a taste. If your not drooling for more, check your pulse.This is a rapid fire account on addiction and rehabilitation. It's honest, gritty and refreshing. Frey leaves no stone unturned in his tailspin which began innocently at age 10. He is unapologetic yet takes full accountabilty for his actions...and thankfully, you don't endure any born again mantles.He hops over the ropes into the ring and goes face to face with his addictionsNo wonder his likes boxing.Oh, you'll never want to go to a dentist again."
4,Good read on fiction not not-fiction accounts,"If this were a real story, WOW, but alas it is nothing but a good read. Lots of people do these kind of things - lie. What is the big deal, the book was moving and made you feel so what it was all a lie. Aren't most of the love stories you read about or watch on T. V. It is all just entertainment."
1,Quality Book...Author Another Story!,"No problem with the vendor, but as everyone has heard...what a con artist ol' Jimmy turned out to be! My wife just had to have this book...I think the $ could have been better spent. Walter Cronkite's book comes to mind.Glen T."
3,Entertaining,"Although a work of fiction, it is an interesting read into the life of a drug user. Obviously written from experience."
5,A rare insight on a common disease..............................,A sometimes too shocking story of one man's survival in arehab center. Where he derives his strengh from is beyondme. The fact that he is still alive is amazing......
2,Hmm....,"Truly, the only thing going for this book was that it was 100%, no-holds-barred, true. I read this in a post-confession world and I tried to keep an open mind.The problem with this book is it all seems to be leading towards an amazing ending but in the end it simply tears down the AA and presents an near-impossible solution.I think even if the book were true it would still be dissapointing because the book is less of a memoir and more of a rant. Mediocrity struggling to make a point. I would read this if you really want to (and lets face it you will read it anyway) but keep in mind that the ending is incredibly dissapointing."
5,loved it!!,"I absolutely loved this book!! Despite all the ""controversy"" it was page turning!! Kudos to James Frey, I enjoyed it so much I got the sequal ""My friend Leonard,"" which was also amazing!"
3,A million Little Pieces,I see what there was such an investigation into the story because some aspects of it seem unrealistic.
3,don't believe it--you're so gullible (sorry Oprah),"Take it from a REAL recovered drug addict--I didn't spend my time reading books when I was in the depths of addiction. Don't waste you time thinking this book is going to help one addict seek treatment since they're all to busy either searching for or enjoying their next high. This book is a good example of how adept addicts are at conning straight people; take it from me, I was an expert at spinning tales when I needed cash for drugs or sympathy. Once you catch an addict in a lie (or series of lies), odds are better-than-not the whole story is a lie--except for the self-admission of being an addict (works every time)."
3,"I WAS GOING TO GIVE IT 5 STARTS, BUT...","What can you say about this book that hasn't already been said on Oprah? Except that it's a well written, fast moving, engaging piece of work that, apparently, is not all true. Say what you want about Frey the man's a WRITER. Is he the second coming of Clifford Irving? In some ways he is. But he's an Author with a capital A.Here's hoping Frey learned his lesson and that the publishing industry doesn't blackball him for life. You're not punishing him, you're depriving the public of a pretty good writer.[...]."
5,Amazing. True or Not,"A Million Little Pieces is an amazing book. James Frey has a unigue gift of story telling. Reading this book an in the face look at the story of a drug addict, the thought process, the healing, and everything inbetween. Both this book and My Friend Leonard are proudly my favorite books still after the negative feedback that some of the truth had been twisted. Regardless of wether or not the book is entirely true, partly true or completely made up, the story is phenominal. It is a look inside addiction, self worth, and healing."
3,Interesting Story,The book is very well written and definitely a page turner. I was a little turned off that alot of it was fabricated. Had it have been classed as fiction it would have surely gotten 5 stars from me.
1,Completely Unbelievable,"My 17 year old read this book first and was so shocked and sickened by this story. Well, when I read it I was shocked and sickened by the tremendous amount of fictitious bravado and crap this guy was pedaling. If you are thinking of buying this book please google ""James Frey"" first. I agree with other reviewers, I just can't believe Oprah,in all her infinite glory, didn't have someone do some fact checking. I am not an addict, however, I can't imagine this does anything to make an addict want to get better or help to inspire anyone. Shame on you James Frey."
3,Conceited Creep,"I read this before the hype about it being fiction and not a memoir as it was originally sold. It was so obvious that he was blowing air out his *@. I enjoyed the storyline, but he was insulting to people who need to use programs to help them get through. He'd brag about how he did it all without the 12 Steps, how hard he'd hit rock bottom, etc., making himself seem cool all the while.Frey was unlikeable as a character in the book, and I personally didn't care if he died or not (as he kept saying would've happened if he kept up his behaviors). I don't have any history of drug use, but if I did, I'd probably be really angry at his lies.I think the reason it got good reviews is that it was so harsh in its style and people thought this was realism. Well folks, it turns out to be just another BS story."
1,what was oprah thinking,This was the most boring book i have ever read. I bought it 2 months ago and still haven't finished it. I initially purchased it becase of all the hype on Oprah's show. Never again will I buy a book that she recommends. What a waste of money!!!
4,So far so good,I have only made it about half way through this book. I read it when I have time and so far it's not really a book that you have a hard time putting down.
2,So poorly written,"I wanted to like this book, especially having enjoyed others in the niche. But, the writing style is so bizarre, with odd capitalisation and no use of speech marks (at all!) that one is constantly reminded one is reading a book, rather than enjoying reading a book."
3,good but not great,I thought it was a good book but seemed very exaggerated. The ending was heart breaking and happy at the same time.
1,What's all the hype about?,I read the whole book only because I kept waiting to get to the good part. There is no good part. I certainly never felt that I couldn't put it down. Day after day of descriptions of him vomiting chunks didn't do it for me as a reader.
5,Amazing,This book was fantastic! It was so intense and addicting in itself. I couldn't put it down nor did i want to. I finished it months ago but i'm still thinking about it and constantly recommending it. It's very instense. If you know anyone close to you who struggles with an addiction i highly suggest you read it.
2,Was interested in the beginning.. badly written fiction.,"His intense descriptions about his addiction captured me through the first 50 pages or so and then after that, I had to MAKE myself read. I'm now on page 100 or so and this will probably be the first book I stop reading in the middle. It's extremely repetitive and horribly fake."
2,badly precocious,Picked up my wife's copy and started reading it. This is poetry gone wrong from an overgrown child. History will not look positively on this book.
5,A Million Little Pieces,"Excellent! Two thumbs up!! This book touched me on such a personal level. Immediately after I finished reading, I bought another copy and sent it to my son to help him. He read the book in less than two days and finally found someone who had the same experiences and passions and the same mentality about recovery. Mind over matter. It's a matter of choice."
2,Even if he said it were fiction...,"[...] it's just not a quality read. The protagonist was not admirable at all to me, but seems to have been created to be sympathized with. However, his stubbornness and hostility towards well-meaning people made him as unlikeable as could be in my eyes. The style of the novel also seems to be pretentious, as if James Frey were attempting to be avant-garde in ignoring conventional punctuation and paragraph structure. His over usage of the letter ""I"" not only added to the selfishness of his narrator, but it also degraded the style of the novel. Though there are good points in the story and some noteworthy things that he does with the rehab experience that most people wouldn't otherwise witness, I wouldn't say this is a classic by any means. Frey has a way to go before he hits anything near that mark.But if you're all plot, then maybe this is a good read for you."
4,Inspiring,"[...] I was immersed in James Frey's portrayal of self-destructive rage. The archetypal Leonard, Lilly and Miles help reconcile the single mindedness of his addiction ridden ""self"" character. I really feel this is a great read [...]."
2,Oprah's way off,"I read this book and I liked it. I liked it because some of the things he went through seemed so unbelievable, but it was not a book of fiction -- that amazed me! The shocking first page -- waking up on the plane, covered in blood, no memory of what happened -- I was AMAZED! I kept thinking -- no way that could have happened -- they wouldn't let this guy on the plane, but this was a memoir!! Was the story regarding his dental work an ""embelishment"" or did it really happen. It was fascinating because it was true...now it's just over-the-top writing."
1,Its all a lie!,He just went on Oprah Winfrey and admitted that much of the book is fabricated for shock value and to carry the story along more attractively.A million little pieces contains about the same number of lies...
2,Chikiwawa's opinion,"This book was too moralizing. I mean come on life's not that important. This guys problem was he took ""having fun"" too far, chikiwawa doesn't have that problem and doesn't want to read moralistic bs either. Thankyou"
5,Wonderful,"This book was so wonderful, so full of ups and downs, so filled with emotion. I think everyone should read it."
4,This is a good book! Who cares if the author embellished a bit,"I read this book before the controversy. Throughout the book I thought there's no way this could all be true. But who cares!!! This book was hard to put down from start to finish. It was a thought provoking, heart wrenching, sad story. I don't think James Frey deserves to be crucified the way that he's been. I think people need to jump off the Oprah bandwagon and start thinking for themselves."
2,Enough already!!!,"I am glad to see that I am not the only one who thought this book was a waste of time. Hardly a literary masterpiece but rather a self aggrandizing, repetitive and grammatically challenged Oprah prodigy. Quit the bad boy crap James, you are a spoiled rich kid who humiliates those who truly are victims."
1,DEPRESSING,"I bought this book based on the fact that I love Oprah and trusted it was a good read. Read it, I can't even get into it and what I have read so far made me sick. What a waste of money this book is. As much as I do love Oprah, I have to say she seems to like very ""heavy"" subject matter. And in fact thinking about it, many of her choices are depressing. No thanks, the world has enough depressing factors."
2,a million little pieces,I have read the book and liked it. I liked it because I thought it was giving me a TRUE look at an addicts behavior and life. To find out now that it is fiction makes me want a refund.
3,Nonfiction? Sure takes a lotta Suspension of Disbelief,"When this book rings true, it's quite good. When the writing style pays off, it's quite good. The problem was plowing through the 80 percent of the text that either rang hollow or annoyed the hell out of me. Was it worth it? Probably, especially since it taught me something about addiction, which I've never understood."
2,Frey just doesn't get it,"James Frey may still be dry/sober, but he comes off as a miserable, depressed person by doing it HIS way. He rejects the concept of a Higher Power, yet has made himself the god of his own world. He illustrates the description of an alcoholic/addict as an egomaniac with an inferiority complex. I very much question most of the details of rehab as he describes them, and I speak from experience and many years of sobriety. Drinking: A Love Story is by far the best description of the mental process in addiction I have read so far,(and Dr. Henry Tiebout's pamphlet, Compliance vs. Surrender perfectly describes removal of the compulsion to drink or use) but if this book helps some people, great. I just hope readers don't unconditionally accept as truth everything in the book. It just doesn't ring true."
5,breathless,"This book took me away to another world that at times I wanted to run away from. There is something in the way he writes that the words penetrate you, and you can feel his pain, addiction, and love. He describes his battle for sobriety one hour at a time, and it can make you cringe, shake, cry, shout, and leave you searching for someone to hold. There is a point where he describes these dreams he has frequently after detox, and I found myself having the same dreams after reading it. When he fell in love with Lilly - I fell in love with Lilly. And the others he met in rehab, well I consider them to be very good friends. This is a fast read because it will consume your life untill the final page. And I have never rushed out so quickly to buy the next book an authur writes. I just hope James Frey is working on another one because I can't wait."
4,"Yes it is fiction, but...","I agree with all the people who are criticizing this book because it does such a ridiculous job of explaining addiction treatment and it could frighten someone away from trying. However, it is the old adage, ""How can you tell when an addict is lying? His lips are moving."" Or, in this case, his fingers on the keyboard. Read this with a grain of salt. It is fictionalized. However, underneath everything I found some good explanations of the feelings involved in addiction. It is impossible for ""normies"" to understand addiction but this book offered some helpful insight. It is considered heresy to criticize AA, but their program is very difficult to accept for a lot of people. Saying, ""You will never stay sober without working the steps,"" just doesn't help. I can understand Frey's frustrations, and there should be ways to address them, not just dismiss them. For another description of the insanity of the disease, and a more accurate view of treatment, see Moyer's ""Broken."""
3,It's alright,"A friend gave me this book when I he found out that I belonged to AA. As a fictional book I really don't think its all that impressive. Every character in the book is completely stereotypical. My sister also went to Denison University in Granville Ohio where Frey attended college and its an extremely preppy school. To say you were a major drug dealer in Granville is comical. I also think it serves as a major diservice to those people who believe Frey beat addiction by ""just holding on"". If you've ever known an addict you understand that ""just holding on"" doesn't work -- at least not for anyone that I've come across in the years I've been in AA.Frey did manage to write an impactful book, and for that I give him kudos. I just wish he would have been upfront with all of the facts rather than trying to dupe everybody. If you want to read a graphic, in your face fictional book about drugs and prisons this book isn't all bad."
1,musings of a spoiled frat boy,"Truthfully, what type of person would believe this cliche ridden piece of garbage? I, literally, laughed out loud reading it. When I learned of the controversy surrounding the ligitimacy of many details in the book, I was not the least bit surprised. Face it, he`s a pathetic little rich boy, who grew up lonely and unpopular, desperately wanting to come across as a tough, no-nonsense, hard-living, bad ass. Anybody who can`t see that, is in need of some real life perspective. Shame on Oprah!! She has now lost every bit of credibility she had left."
5,"RAW, REAL and even if it were embellished-BRILLIANT.","I loved this book. I felt it. I have a hard time believing any human who ever had a struggle of some kind wouldn't grasp onto this book and not put it down until it was finished. MY FRIEND LEONARD is equally as entertaining and real. I think if one doesn't, they are either too ""normal"" to get it, or are in incredible denial about their own life and perhaps addicitons.James Frey nailed it. If he were to ""embellish"", don't you think it would be a lot nastier than this? Brilliant."
5,a personal perspective,"I am biased. I read this book about 10 months ago and found it riveting from start to finish. Soon afterward, I contacted Mr. Frey with the hope that he would endorse my own memoir, ""Hammerhead 84."" And to my great surprise he did just that. (His blurb appears on the back cover.)Now that we're all aware that much of what he wrote was fabrication, I am torn. On the one hand, I remain grateful to James for his kindness and generosity. And I still appreciate the great story he wrote. But on the other hand I hold strongly to the value that a memoir remain truthful. It must be the author's personal truth, and it must be THE truth.I hold James and Random House accountable for the mistruths. Public embarrassment is their punishment. Hopefully, the word ""memoir"" will regain its kinship with truth. But now there are lawyers and feigned victims out there trying to turn a profit out of the situation. That is equally reprehensible, and absurd."
4,A Million Little Pieces,"This is a very raw account of overt drug and alcohol abuse and the giving over of one's self to it even though death is certain if the abuse continues. It is amazing that the author is able to give such a clear account of this time in his life while attempting recovery, considering his state of mind and being at the time. Incredible reading and not for the faint of heart."
3,Very sad to see,"that Americans need a talk show host to tell them what to read.Sadder yet is the fact that the person preaching what good literature is is the originator of trash talk TV (remember how Oprah beat Phil Donohue to become Number 1?).Wake up, people! Walk into your local library's literature department and make your own choices.James Frey knew what he was doing when he wrote what he did but for Oprah Winfrey to get preachy on TV was uncalled for. You were duped. Swallow it and move on."
1,AMillion Little Pieces,"I was watching Oprah a week or so ago and she and several members of her audience raved that they couldn't put the book down. I haven't found one like that since the Thornbirds so decided to buy it. Made a special trip to a bookstore about 15 miles from my home and settled in when I returned home to read this. I kept thinking it would get better and when I got to page 53 I just stopped and thought, I have had enough. When I took it to our local library this afternoon the librarian was thrilled to receive it and said they had a huge waiting list. I told her that I thought it was absolutely terrible and can't imagine anyone finishing this book. I must say that this is the only book I have ever gone to read the last page because I knew I would never finish reading it."
2,It's better if you yourself were an addict,"Or have someone in your life who is/was. This book has received a lot of undeserved hype. Spoiled rich kid who can't understand why his sheltered upbringing has left him unarmored and unable to understand that Life Isn't Fair. Unfortunately it's become a literary genre of sorts in the last decade. In Frey's case, the writing, such as it is, is a bit precious, as are the typographical tricks, AND YET, I can see how this book would hold your attention if your own personal circumstances aligned with his. It's just a shame that he wasn't able to reveal his insights in a somewaht more accessible fashion."
2,A better screenplay than a book...,"I'm sorry. But I ain't buying it.I believe James Frey was a hopeless addict, I believe he went to a facility like the one he described, I believe he has now kicked his addictions through sheer will power, and I admire him for it. But I don't believe one of word of the dialogue he wrote in this autobiography, the characters he describes, or the interactions he had.The people come off as archetypal. The interactions make believe. That's not to say he's not a good writer, it's just that I didn't believe what I was reading to be a factual account of what really happened.He is imaginative and should write more movies."
1,Get Rich Fast! Get Empathy with Lies by the author himself..,"Spare me. The guy was in jail for two hours but calls his book a memoir, then writes he was in prison for 87 days (far from embellishing but blatant lies). This author would've been better off categorizing his book as fictitious or ridiculous. He went as far as lying about his own girlfriend's suicide.His formulaic writing approach to tug at the heartstrings of readers everywhere for lessons he supposedly learned from all the ""hardship"", geez, merely displays a Poor little rich guy with a selfish little drive."
1,Guy's a Fraud,"This shows how easily the fake can be marketed more easily than the genuine. From the editorial reviews right on down, a total fantasy. And Oprah is right in there: first with the marketing, then with the attack . . . laughing all the way to the bank."
1,A bad book on every level,"This prose of this book is horrid and the story is utterly cliche. As such, it was no surprise when it came out that Frey had tried for a long time to publish his book as FICTION.It was horrible fiction and the publishers knew it. But then he tried to sell it as a memoir (or publishers coaxed him into doing that) since people are suckers for survival memoirs.It is totally despicable that Frey lied. But even if he hadn't, and had published this as fiction, it would still be a bad, bad book.(People interested in a good book on addiction, read Denis Johnson's ""Jesus' Son"")"
1,Not truly recovered,"Sorry but anyone who has abused any substance and faced recovery would say that it isn't just quitting the use of that substance that proves you are recovered. It is the change of character, the facing down your demons and gaining victory over them. If one has to lie about one's circumstances and events surrounding one's addictions then I would seriously question their recovery. This author is not recovered, sure he isn't abusing any longer but he is still living with his demons and is using lies to keep them at bay. But with the present controversy nipping at his heals he will have to stare those demons and his obvious self loathing down. But if he just 'holds on' perhaps he'll come out better on the other side of things. After all, he is his own higher power."
2,Vapid,Frey will shock you over the first 50 pages - no question. The rest is repetitive; more of the same discusting and wrenching prose. The writing gets flat after his fifteenth trip to the bathroom - the book should be called a Million Little Trips to the Bathroom Floor. The book fails because it makes dull such shocking subject matter.
3,Million Druggie Vanes,"Much preferred MY FRIEND LEONARD which I read before the major hoopla over the ""authenticity"" of A Million Little Pieces and his appearances on Larry King and Oprah for the second time.The minute details of drug addiction just isn't that interesting if you've read numerous books or seen films on the subject, and know that the drug addicted life is really no life at all and that the power required to overcome addiction is tremendous."
2,A Million Little Run-Ons,"Originally I read this book as non-fiction and thought that it had a real quality to its writing a ""raw"", unedited, run-on sentence, no structure sort of feel. But now that I no that it is fiction i had to change my rating from four to two. As a fiction novel it is flat out horrible novel and i can see why it got rejected from 17 publishing companies before it was picked up."
2,What a mess,"Lies or not, this book is rather foul. Mr. Frey's overuse of literary techniques totally destroys the first half of this book. The book becomes more tolerable in the second half but just as irritating. There is a difference between airing dirty laundry and romanticizing the love-hate relationship with one's past sins....which in this case, appears to be mostly love. This book reeks of narcissism and some parts were so bad that I had to skim over them, and I am one that usually loves to soak up every single word."
1,Stopped Reading It When I Discovered It Was Fiction,"I began reading the book and its appeal was in how such a traumatic series of events propelled someone downwards only to climb back up - now that this has become largely a work of fiction or faction whatever, its appeal is gone. The dishonesty of the author undermines the premise of the book - an honest account of real struggles.I admire those who truly write honest, real memoirs - now I will consign this book to the literary scrapheap and not even bother finishing it."
2,"Oprah, is he truly redeemed if he still hasn't stopped lying?","EXAMPLE:The Book Says: He hit a cop with his car, fought with the cops who came to help, and was jailed for 3 months.The Truth Is: Police found him drunk in his car and he was kept several hours at the police station.His Recent Explanation For The Discrepancy: Poor memory!Obviously, a mistake remembering might account for getting wrong the number of cops he fought with. But stretching an overnight jail stay into 90 days is not a memory error, it's a lie.Oprah says she continues to stand behind her choice because the book's message of redemption still resonates with her. But every redemption scheme, every 12-step program I've seen includes a prerequisite of honesty with one's self and with others. To still blame memory at this stage of the expose is something other than truthful."
3,A wonderful read!!!,"A great book, I couldn't put it down. Please don't believe the negative feedback. An insiteful appreciation of this terrible disease. Enjoy!!!"
3,An interesting story of struggles with addiction.,"As an employee of a major recovery home, I knew pretty quickly (the dental thing)the author had taken some license. Nobody would get away with that stuff (not going to meetings) where I work! The staff characters were pretty true to form. A good read."
2,Imaginative...,"I found the story very difficult to believe. Particularlywhen it came to oral surgery without anesthesia. For thosewho seek a much more revealing story of addiction and recovery,I recommend Augusten Burroughs ""Dry""."
1,A Million Little Errors,"Regardless of the controversy about the truthfulness of author James Frey, this is a horribly written, poorly edited, and contrived ""memoir"" designed solely to pull at the reader's heartstrings using keywords such as ""addiction"" and ""recovery"".Unfortunately, the people that continue to recommend ""A Million Little Pieces"" as a useful tool for addicts and now advise to read it solely as a work of fiction after the revelations of Mr. Frey's embellishments and outright lies are espousing the idea that the ends justify the means... an excuse that active addicts make use of in their daily lives and need no more encouragement to continue with."
1,unbelievable,"I purchased this book based on Oprah's recommendation and because I am intimately familiar with addiction, having come from a family of addicts. I didn't get to the mid-section of this book before I put it down. It was unmitigated garbage. I just knew that the stories were not true or at the very least embellished. When the true story came out I was not the least bit surprised. I gave the book to Goodwill and Good Ridance as far as I am concerned. The author does not deserve to profit from this, but of course he has."
1,Evident from the first page.,"You can tell he's a liar from the first paragraphs. A *doctor* (?) and two others bring him aboard a plane. How gothic. Why not a nurse in a miniskirt and a creased white hat bobby-pinned to her hair?Around 40 legitimate reviews of Frey's book were purged today from this page--dating from 01/10 through present--in order to refloat the author's rating. They deleted reviews which hadn't pointed to the URL at all.You will notice an organized, concerted effort to redeem the book by reviews that have appeared in the last several hours. They are easily recognized by ellipses that bracket them--as well as their pistillate writing style. The ellipses may be traces of a field (in a form mailing) asking for upbeat reviews from confederates; the punctuation may have been poorly arranged so that many of these writers overlooked them before posting."
1,HA!!!!,I guess that this book just proves that people will believe anything they read.The fact that he fooled Oprah and her mindless zombie fans is hysterical! I guess the guy better sell his 'summer' home and his New York condo because his writing career is going to go down the tubes after all of this.
1,STOP BUYING THIS BOOK!!!,"What's the biggest disgrace? That this author has been revealed as a fraud or the public is still buying the book. Oprah, you should demand to have your name taken off it!! It's horrible that this is number one on Amazon. If you are considering buying it please don't!!! Pick a nonfiction book by someone who tells the truth."
1,A Million Little Lies,"Thank god I didn't actually pay for this book! I read a few pages of a friend's copy and I found myself laughing out loud several times during the first passage. Think about it: how many airlines would allow a passenger on to their flight reeking of puke and urine, drunk to the point of being comatose, missing their front teeth, with a hole in their cheek and blood flowing down their chin on to their chest? Anybody that could get passed this and believe any of this tripe would probably believe anything. Please, do yourself a favor before paying for this mediocre work of fiction, and go to Smoking Gun website to read more about Frey's lies."
3,A Million Random Thoughts,"Never mind the hype about whether certain passages of this book really happened. Never mind that the author committed a cardinal sin by ticking off Oprah Winfrey. This book is not worth reading simply because it's badly written. It's full of random thoughts, non sequiters and incoherent ramblings. It wallows in a place that I simply didn't want to go. If it speaks to you as a reader, that's terrific. But it just left me out in the cold."
3,"Easy to read, hard to digest","This novel is written in a disjointed ee cummings-esque style - random capitalization of words provide emphasis, uneven punctuation makes for a poem-like read. Once you get used to Frey's style though, the book is one you won't be able to put down. Frey's imagery is graphic and real - this book is not for the faint at heart. If you can handle the blood & guts though, you will be rewarded with a captivating, real-life journey the author took to recovery. His friends were not so lucky. The one thing that bothered me about the book was the statement Frey made regarding 12 step programs. While I am not an addict, I know many people who are friends of Bill and the 12 steps truly saved their lives. That the author escaped certain death from his addictions through will alone is hard to believe. I'm glad for him, but his denunciation of the 12 steps is somewhat irresponsible given the wide reach of his audience. Just one woman's opinion."
2,Too much hype,"I hated this book. It made me feel dirty reading it. The author was such a scumbag for the first 23 years of his life, and he expects to atone for everything by telling us over and over in the book how he knows he is an addict, and criminal, as if this explains why he was such a creep to everyone in his life? Yuck!"
5,Don't care that it's fiction,"Truth or fiction, I don't really care. I loved this book and would definitely recommend. I could not put it down."
1,A real let down,"I bought Frey's book because I was under the impression it was true life events. While well written, it's value dropped decidely when I found it to be lies.Richard Neal HuffmanAuthor of Dreams In Blue: The Real Police ( a real non-fiction )"
3,"Awesome, but not true","This book is evrything a good book should be. Heart wrenching, sweet, pathetic, eye-opening, stomach turning, thrilling, sad, happy, conquering. And the list can go on and on. The only things it IS NOT is what it says it should be -TRUE. It was proven, and James Frey was cross examined. Apparently a ""memoir"", most of the most exciting and heart wrenching parts of the book are nothing more than a wild imagination. Publishers would not buy this book as a novel, but later bought it as a ""memoir"". But it does not take away from the fact that it is still a good book"
4,RIVETING and ENLIGHTENING,"I am not an avid book reader. Boredom hits me quickly with most books whose author finds it necessary to illustrate everything/everyone in the vicinity before actually getting to the story. This book just jumps right into the deep end and carries you along.Mr.Frey's experiences are so well spoken; I feel like I am actually witnessing his ordeal firsthand.The only problem I have with the credibility of the author's story is his tale of the brutal oral surgery without any novicaine whatsoever. Is novacaine an addicting pain killer? I don't think so. It seems that the whole ordeal was over the top. And, why on earth would a patient in rehab be allowed to walk around in clothes that have spit, blood and vomit on them? If this rehab center is so highly acclaimed, I hardly think that this would have occurred.If Mr. Frey can explain this, I would really appreciate it.So far, the book raises more questions than it answers. But it is a riveting, yet simply written read."
1,A Million Little Pieces,"After the controversy about this book, I refused to read it & returned it to Amazon for a refund."
3,entertaining but like other people say obviously made up,I liked the way it was written. Some parts were so intense. But as most of us know lots of his stuff has been debunked now. For that reason on 3 stars from me. a good read
3,An unfortunate non-reality..,"I really enjoyed this book as I read it, there were scenes that we're so emotive for many reasons and I really felt for the author.. HOWEVER, on finishing the book, I looked up James Fray and it turns out the story was a lie, he made the entire story up..On face value, it is a good read; but I felt cheated out of the reality I expected it to be.."
1,thank you james,"loved the book, loved the writing style and hope and the message it sent. i'm a former probation officer and usually dont like these types of books but the heart and soul that this book showed was overpowering. most of you critics are looking at all the negatives and not the message of life and overcoming addiction that it sends, shame on you and to oprah too! thank you james!"
1,A million little lies,"I cannot believe that so many people that have reviewed his book and he still has over 4 stars! What is going on? How do lies sell like hotcakes? It is so obviously far from the truth it is sickening. There is nothing like the pains of detox except the lies of someone pretending to ""play"" detox and banking off it. How warped can you be? Standing in front of people like the golden child as if you deserve some respect from the public-HA! i want my money back Frey! You owe it back to all of us that were cheated!!!"
1,"fiction love, more","I'm ashamed to see this is in with Oprah. I ashamed to even see it is on Amazon and how it is rated. Ratings can fool you, just as this author did. A ridiculous piece of FICTION....."
1,Terrible,"I don't really know where to start to tell you how bad this book is. First of all, I find it deeply suspicious and cunning that Oprah is pitching this book to her readers. If it was a classic she was reccomending, I would understand it, but I cannot help but think: What is the benefit for Oprah and her company behind all this?The Oprah issue aside: This book is not a memoir, it is a very bad form of fiction. I cannot believe that it was even published. The writing is very tiring, confusing, and not to mention, fabricated and egaggurated.His experiences are way over the top, and I am not even sure if he was that much of an ""addict"" to begin with. Everything that he writes in his book is fiction, not reality!Do not waste your money on this."
1,Fiction with bad dialogue,"I really started to have my doubts after getting to the end when James talks to Leonard. ""James, I would like you to be my son. I will watch out for you as I would if you were my real son, and I will offer you advice and help guide you through your life. If there are ever issues with your real father, I must insist that you defer to him and respect him before me and over me."" Oh, please! I think this guy watched a few too many mobster movies with his frat buddies.Yeah, there were a whole bunch of things in the book that didn't seem true, but Frey has a tin ear for dialogue, and that was what really stood out as false.Now The Smoking Gun has exposed him as a fraud. My question is, did his family go along with his plan, or did he dupe them, too?"
4,A Million Little Pieces,It was an interesting read until all of the controversy came out about it being a fake story.
4,A Million Little Pieces,"English majors may find the fragments and run-ons distracting, but Frey cultivates a unique style that is sure to provoke a reaction from even the most stoic readers.This reader found his transformation convincing and realistically difficult. The book clearly gives insight into living with addiction. One wonders, though, which parts were fictionalized or sensationalized."
3,A Million Little Pieces,"I admit the only reason I read this book was because of the controversy surrounding it and the subsequent interview of the author James Frey on Oprah. I found it a little difficult to get into but after a couple of chapters i was drawn in and became interested in knowing more about the character and whether he would master his demons. Although 427 pages, it is a quick read and many pages included dialogue with one word sentences such as:Hello.Hi.How are you feeling today?How do I look?Fine.So many of the pages are read quite rapidly. The book did leave me wondering how/why it became an Oprah Book club selection. But to each his own I suppose."
5,A Million Little Pieces,"I can honestly say this is the best book I've ever read in my whole life. I couldn't put it down. I'm retired and stayed up and read all night. Unbelievable!!!I'm 68 years old, and I sent this book to everyone I knew!"
4,A dramatic account of a struggling addict's rehabilitaion.,I felt that this book was an excellent read. The story captivated me and brought forth a new sense of reality of what it must be like to be dependant on a substance.
1,A million little Lies,"See the above title for a hilarious spoof of this previously peddled as fiction but failed to get published as such book.I seriously think the author should be forced to give all of his money to charity since what he has done constitutes fraud.Even his writing style is a rip off. See Hubert Selby's, ""Requiem for a Dream"" to see where he got his writing style.His lies have been well documented elsewhere so there is no need to review them here. I began to get suspicious when he said that he had to have root canal work done without anesthesia. My sister was/is a junky and she has had extensive dental work done with loads of novocaine.The fallout of all of Mister Frey's lies has lead to no responsibility taking on his part.As one reviewer wrote recently,""Lying has now become its own literary genre""God bless our current administration."
2,Much Ado About Nothing!,"Okay, admittedly, ""nothing"" may be a bit harsh but it isn't that far off. This book was nowhere near deserving of the hype it has received. After hearing Oprah's staff rave about it, I was expecting to have a life-altering experience. Didn't happen. Interesting? Sure. Well written? For the most part. But worthy of all the accolades it's received? Hardly. This may be my last book club read for a while. And to all those who claimed that this is the most graphic, raw and brutally honest thing they've ever read: try to get out more."
2,Not all what it was hyped up to be...,"Being yet-another-person who got into the hype that Oprah made around this book, I decided to purchase it, only after a few months when I felt that my excitement for the book would die a bit so that I would have an objective look on the book. I was extremely disappointed. It was in no way a page-turner like it was all hyped up to be, nor it was in any way a well-written even.I get the concept of the book, the fact that the writer was ""supposedly"" in rehab for treatment against extreme drug addictions, and for that I was not expecting anything, no eloquence nor coherence even, but still, I was disappointed.Now, with James Frey being exposed as fraud, I have one recommendation for him, ""If you plan on being a good writer, go read a few books first"""
1,Do You Have A Half A Star?,"This book was terrible.If I could I would have given it a half a star.My co worker was reading this book back in December and I told her I did'nt believe him.His story was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too fantastic and so far fetched.The he when on to write another one,My Friend Leonard.This one was based on a freind of his that was a mobster on drugs and he died of aids.Please,give me a break.More lies,when will it end?A drug addict can barely remember what happened to them last week.So you mean to tell me he supposely remembered all of these bad experiences he had?Low and behold,they were all lies.Not only did he lie but he brought out sad emotions from people over his deceit.I know a few drug addicts that can write a better story if they were given the chance."
1,Phoney book,"If fiction or non fiction it is a bad read. The arrogance of the author is palpable. He portrays treatment in a awful manner. 12 step programs have saved alot of lives and he would have been thrown out of treatment, not allowed to stay taking up space, with his angry condescending attitude. Will remember his name and make sure I dont bother ever again"
3,"The Man Who Says ""Just Hold On"" To Drug Addiction",I read the book and enjoyed it. However I am a bit peeved that James Frey is a congenital liar and has oversimplified drug and alcohol addiction. This book will probably do nothing to most people suffering from drugs and alcohol. It is merely a powder puff piece of conceit and extreme bravado.
1,Telling lies does matter,"I was about half way through this book when I began hearing all of the ""hoopla"" surrounding it. At first, I was not all that interested. Then, after watching Oprah, I fully began to understand the gravity of the situation. Like Oprah and millions of other readers, I became really invested in Frey and his tales of addiction. I wanted to read this book and find out what happens...not to some fictionalized character but to James Frey, the person. If I wanted to read a fictionalized account of addiction and rehab., I would have. This was put out as a memoir and thus, should have some semblance of authenticity. It's one thing to change a few minor details to protect people, but it's another rhelm of literature all together to fabricate a story (it's called fiction). I think this is just another fine example of the dumbing down of America. We were duped again.In the end, I thrrew the book away - disguisted."
2,Sobriety Is Serious Business,"True sobriety is a beautiful thing and will change your life completely. One of the first steps in achieving that kind of sobriety is soul-searching 'rigorous honesty'.Prior to the author's revelations in the media, I bought this book to read while on a cross country trip. Within the first hour of reading I put the book down and left it on the plane.I had no desire to finish it - It just didn't ring true.Recovery is serious business and people in meetings share from their heart about real experiences. When you hear from them first hand it makes it hard to listen to someone who is manufacturing their story merely for the sake of storytelling.All the best to those of you who are sincerely trying to work a program in sobriety. However I do not feel this book will be of any value in attaining that goal."
1,Awful: I'd give it a zero if I could,"I think James Frey needs to take some lessons in how to construct a page. He and some others think he's a brilliant writer with his non-format format. I struggled for a while to read the dense text with no paragraph breaks and no punctuation and finally gave up. It was so unpleasant to read, I simply lost interest. I also didn't buy the part of him getting on that plane in the beginning. No airline would allow anyone in his condition to board a plane. I fly a lot and I've seen people in much better shape than he was denied boarding.How do books like this get published? The redemption from drugs and alcohol is admirable, but he could've done a much better job in telling the story. People who need to read this book the most probably wouldn't be able to concentrate on the horror of its presentation."
1,A Waste of Time,"I read this book before all the controversy. Had I posted a review it would have been a 5 star. But in light of all the true facts that have come out about this I can't give it any more than one star. If you read this and you think it is a true or almost true memoir,I can forgive a few fudges, you are blown away at what one person could overcome. However to know major portions of the book are fabricated, unsubstantiated and just as made up as a unicorn, it's a lot more to swallow. Mr. Frey has enormous talent. They have a whole fiction side of the bookstore last I checked. This book may not have done as well being fiction but atleast then it would have been honest. I was so excited to read ""My Friend Leonard"" to see how this remarkable young man righted himself to were he was today but now I can't even get past the first page knowing it is all lies. Was there even a Leonard? I guess we'll never know."
