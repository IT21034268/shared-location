4,Fair enough,"performance: better than good but not as good as I wanted.built: fair but yet I still have to assess it more since I use this item not so often. I say fair since the the unit itself is kinda made of low grade plastic. its component particularly the bits are of very poor quality.advantages: it comes with an extension which really helps a lot since you don't have to carry this bulky and heavy tool.overall I would say that this unit is doing what it supposed to do hence above average is the best grade I could ever give. as what have been mentioned, the bits are poorly made and the extension plus stand is a plus for this unit, not to mention it's case."
1,Poor quality,"The quality of this product is very poor. The instructions that came with the product are miserable. Yes it's cheap, but my advice is to save your money and buy a Dremel instead- I wished I had."
5,Awesome,Great customer service. Very impressed from order to something I returned because I didn't need. Thanks!!! Really awesome. The comuunication was perfect.
1,Poor Quality Control on This Item,"The Mixer came poorly packed. The box that contained the motor was light-weight and packed with many parts with sharp edges. As a result, the power cord was cut and needed to be replaced. After about two hours of assembly I found that the drum would bind up as it would rotate. I contacted customer service at Red Lion and found that the cast iron part of the drum had a casting flaw and was out of round. They transfered me to a supervisors voice mail and I left a message. As of today I have not received a return call and I have a 200 pound piece of junk in the garage. If you want to avoid a hassel I suggest you choose a different brand."
4,010630 Red Lion Mixer,"The directions were in several different languages, I would have prefered only one set in English. The number of nuts and bolts and parts initially overwhelmed me, but with a little patience and some simple tools it took me less than two hours to have the mixer up and running. I like its sturdy construction. I mixed about two cubic yards of concrete today, continuously running the mixer for four hours. It worked like a charm. It is convenient because you can set up next to your materials and fill, then dump the mixed product in your wheelbarrow on the opposite side. It should be about six inches taller, but you can compensate for its short height by setting it on blocks or bricks. It's convenient to have my own mixer for small jobs."
5,Great Mixer!!,"I just recently purchased the Red Lion mixer and I am very pleased. The instructions that it came with were staight forword and easy to follow. I put the mixer together in just under 3 hours (be sure to grease the areas recommended). I have used the mixer on several different occasions and from start to finish the job could not get any easier. Washing the mixer is really easy, just fill the mixer with water and let it run, the water will break down the cement to sand and you are done and clean!!! Really nice product."
4,cement great/mortar fair,"The mixer works great for bags of cement, but is a little out of the right angle to mix mortar. But then its probably for cement only anyway."
2,You'll hear why Oue didn't last long,"I guess the Minnesota orchestra hoped to get the next Ozawa when they hired oue, but he has vanished, never to reaappear. He isn't up to professional conducting in many technical regards, and although the sonics here are really demonstration quality, the readings don't come close to rivaling even the average Pictures at an Exhibition."
5,Supprise,"I bought this for a minor project I was doing that was too little for my ""man-sized"" woodworking tools. I clearly thought that this would be one of those tools that I used rarely, if at all. Well, I am using this tool almost daily! There always seems to be something to smooth out, cut a little here or there, or grind down just a fraction. This little tool is perfect for the job.I would recommend this (the cordless) model as if had a cord, it would be much more likely to be unused."
3,Hate to burst the Dremel bubble..,"Two problems..Although I rarely use mine (maybe once every two months), sometime during the first year I started having to fight my charger so it would charge the tool.Secondly, The variable switch stopped working. So now I have only one speed.. High.I plan on shipping it back to get it fixed, but since I rarely use it, it hasn't been a top priority..When you pay for a expensive tool, you expect it to be dependable and not stop working right in a few months when you're not using it.I guess I should have stuck with Lowes's house brand..."
3,"Nice, But Expensive","I purchase this in 2007 directly from Amazon. It cost $4 back then. It came within a week with free super saving shipping (which is basically standard shipping). The stickers are made of high quality material. It is bigger than it looks in the picture, which I was very pleased with. I used my stickers for a scrapbook page. The stickers are also amazingly detailed, which I was very happy about.These are dimensional stickers, which means that they have texture to them and you can actually feel them, just like embellishments - these aren't printed stickers on a sticker sheet (which is why they cost more).I only gave it three stars because it is very pricey. I buy lots of Jolee stickers (they are the best in their industry), and they have other stickers that cost the same amount that is a lot nicer than this - which is basically a small thanksgiving wreath and nothing else. I was kind of disappointed with this one."
1,STOP!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!,"As noted above, you cannot play this DVD. What is wrong with Warner? Why would they sell a product that US viewers cannot play"
1,This DVD may not work on your computer!,"The Barenboim ""Siegfried"" DVD that Amazon sent me did not work as described in Amazon's ""Product Details"". ""Product Details"" stated that this DVD is for ""Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only)"". That was not true of the copy that I received. When I tried to play the DVD, it triggered a message stating that it was incompatible with the ""Region"" setting of my DVD/CD disc drive, and that if I wanted to play the DVD, I had to reset the drive from ""1"" (USA) to some other region. But when I reset the region to ""2"" (Europe), another message said that I could only switch regions four times (even if Windows was reinstalled after the fourth region change!). I've never encountered this problem before. Since all my other opera DVDs are Region 1, I will return this ""Siegfried"" DVD to Amazon. The DVD (or at least the copy I received) is simply incompatible with a standard USA DVD/CD disc drive."
1,This book is a real disappointment and I would not recommend,This book is for all intent and purpose a ouija board based on the Lord of the Rings. The author of the book rocommends weird stuff such as using a provided ring tied to a string to get answers to questions. From what I gathered he actually believes this and wants you to also. Tolkien was a religious man and would never have approved of this book.
1,A travesty,"Tolkien would have loathed this and everything it stands for. He was a Christian, not a gulliable New Age dimwit. An indefensible rip-off and travesty of the work of a great genius"
3,GREAT PICTURES ...,"THIS BOOK HAS GREAT PICTURES AND THE AUTHOR IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAINS CERTAIN INTERESTING POINTS. HOWEVER, I FOUND IT CONFUSING SOMETIMES AND WITH A LACK OF EXPLANATIONS IN CERTAIN AREAS. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO BEGINNERS (ONLY TO ENJOY THE PICTURES).ALSO, THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE MUTATIONS ARE TOO COLORFUL ... NOT WHAT THE AFRICAN LOVE BIRD SOCIETY USES, THIS IS WHAT IN MY OPINION WOULD CONFUSE A BEGINNER."
4,Lovebird Atlas Books A2,"I realy love this book, it was just what I was looking for. The only thing negative was the shipping! It was sent flat letter with no bubble wrap, all the corners were bent and indentations in the hard color. The book is great, but the condition I recieved it in was not good. The cover was 20 to 30 % damaged."
3,Not for Beginners,"The book is full of photos and diagrams - A lot of professional time has been put into this book. I bought the book in hope that it would help me with my pain issues and to lose weight. I opened the book - looked at the wonderful pictures, read the 'instructions', and felt instantly overwhelmed. I'm a mechanical kind of person and have no medical or holistic background. Most of the techniques require a second person because of position, the locations of the pressure points, and potential multiple simultaneous points. It might be a great book - The problem might be the operator."
4,more for use by two people and somewhat complicated,"I got this book from my library and agree with the writer who said it isn't for beginners, although others feel comfortable that it is. Many procedures need two people for pressure on difficult to reach points. It really seems, to me, that it's written more for practitioners. Having said all of that I gave it 4 stars because it has a great deal of good information for those who are able use it."
4,Good book,Good book. Doesn't have too many details but you couldn't expect more from a book this size. The tips are great and useful.
1,DARKNESS OF DAY,"Darkness of CRAP!!!!!! I am calling ""shenanigans"" on whoever gave this film a 5 star review. I dont even want to call it a film it is an insult to every film ever made . Who ever gave this 5 stars owes me $3.99 i except checks and every major credit card. Dont waist your money or time .I wouldnt even watch it if it was FREE. The acting was horrific, the scripting was elementary at best.I am a big independent film fan but this was just blasphemy. I didnt even want to give it 1 star but it made me."
3,Frustrated.,I'm just a little frustrated with this product. It says it takes Windows XP but it will not install on my computer. Ive tried time and time again but it always tells me windows does not have a driver that supports bluetooth technology. wtf
4,Not for electronics,"I made the mistake of using this on electronic circuit boards and found that the residue causes shorts. This is however a great flux for attaching larger pieces of metal together such as pipes or for soldering big wires or buses that do not have any nearby active circuitry that you can thoroughly clean in water and you want to ensure a strong bond.The improvement in solderability is quite noticeable, It is a little hard to just apply a small amount of the flux though or precicely apply it without spilling to other areas. it tends to goop and form ""peaks"" that fall over onto adjacent parts, so it should be used for large welds or brazing that you can clean afterwords."
3,"Essential for Die-Hards, But Not The Best DVD Money Can Buy","This DVD edition of the 1995 IWA King of the Death Match Tournament is a must-have for die-hard wrestling fans as well as Mick Foley fans. That said, the video quality is only a little better than your old VHS copy of a copy and the sound may not even be in stereo. The matches on this set are in many respects below average--many slow-paced outings as well as botched spots make this card drag on in places. This card represents a historic moment; however, it was the night in which Mick Foley established himself as one of the most acomplished hardcore wrestlers in the world."
2,Refreshing role from Lorenzo Lamas,"This movie is also known as Back to Even. Being an action hero in all his movies, it is hard to picture Lorenzo Lamas in this role as the victim. Good performance from both Lorenzo and Michael Pare. Lorenzo did very well in portraying the unfortunate and victim of Pare's character lured into counterfeit money.This is not the usual Lorenzo Lamas movie, so if you are looking for martial art's stuff, this movie is not for you. However, recommended for Lorenzo Lamas' fans."
4,Very handy and easy to use.,"I am not an expert on acupuncture but I am slowly learning some of the technique. What I often used it for is to detect surface nerve damage on certain areas of my head and face caused by surgery, and the areas of my foot and leg that was caused by sciatic nerve damage. It is better to use e-Acu-Pen than to stick myself with an ordinary pin. I also experiment with e-Acu-Pen on my scalp."
1,e acu pen,"I am certain this is ordinarily a good product as it was reccomended by friends. I received the product quickly in a few days after ordering, but the product was damaged, having a bent battery clip problem and the batteries were completely dead. I attempted contact with Hollywood gadgets on several occassions unsuccesfully. No email answer, no return of my phone messages. I discovered the batteries were dead straightened the clips and bought new batteries,which are a bit pricey, now the product works, but the aforementioned clips are not very secure.I am still not receiving any response from the company at all.So we are hopeful it will continue to work as it now is.John"
2,Not one of Ms. Stanhope's Best Books!!!,"I have enjoyed every book Ms. Stanhope has ever written, but I really did not enjoy this one at all. The ending was very disappointing. At the end of the book Chaz Kelly just accepted what Lola St. James (Sadie Green) said and then asked her to marry him. I was looking for some type of heated arguement between the two or something and then they could get married after they made up. Also Lola St.James was making deals with Chaz's ex-women behind his back, but that never came out. This book just was not one of Ms. Stanhope's best. Perhaps her next one will be better."
2,It built you up to for nothing,I couldnt wait for it come then it dissappointed me. It started good but went flat after the thrid chapter.. .Save your money
4,"Actually a good, magical score","I know that Power Rangers seems like a childrens tv show, but this movie was taken up a notch. The costumes were more like body armor, the graphics were computerized, the story was new and exciting, and the music was scored by a known and accomplished composer: Graeme Revell. When I saw the movie for the first time, I really enjoyed it, and the music is what did it. Without the music the movie would have been good, but the orchestral score helped emphasize the feelings the viewers got from watching the movie. It was emotional, exciting, and was fun to listen to. I even got goosebumps a few times. I searched a long time for this cd. I bought this score the first time I saw it. I have listened to it for the past 5 years, and I still enjoy it. The music captured the magical feeling the movie gives the viewer. It makes you want to be a super hero."
5,A super seder!,"The most user-friendly haggadah around. Perfect for seders with young and old, Jewish and non Jewish participants. Plenty of provocative discussion questions to make each seder different. We had enthusiastic participation from the kids and adults and can't wait to use it again."
4,Gets a hecsher from me!,"This is the 3rd year we've used this haggadah--we decided to invest in enough for the whole table. It's great because it's got clearly written Hebrew, English and transliteration. It's simple, with good questions and comments in the sidebars to spark some additional conversation. Your seder can be simple and straightforward, or more thought-provoking using this haggadah. I also like the CD of Passover songs that is available to go with this. We had fun singing along while preparing our Pesach meal! If the illustrations were better, I'd give it 5 stars."
3,Lacking their best-ever track,"Once again, Rhino does an all-too-obvious job of picking tracks for a ""Best of"" collection. The Tremeloes had 4 US hits, and about 3 times that many in the UK, but the A-sides of their singles only told part of the story. Many of their B-sides were more adventurous, in particular the US B-side to their last charting single (""Suddenly You Love Me""). ""Suddenly Winter"", a swirling, psychedelic masterpiece at 2:22, is the BEST track The Trems ever made. Backwards guitar, oddball lyrics, beautiful harmonies. Pick up one of the Import CDs by The Tremeloes that has this track on it. It is worth every penny."
1,Great for a child's tea party but nothing else,"Cheap and tacky, I returned it the second i opened the box. I would be embarrassed to serve anything on it. Great customer service from Amazon though, no problems returning it."
4,Glad to be Back to Using Corelle,"I had read a couple of other reviews of this item stating that the first shipment wasn't packed well, resulting in damaged goods. That happened with my first shipment, too. I found the box on my doorstep, having been left by the carrier. When I picked it up, the broken glass could be heard and felt rolling around in the package. Amazon.com made it right though, and the second shipment was in perfect condition. The dishes go with anything, fit well into the dishwasher (one of my many complaints about the more expensive stoneware I've been using) and are very attractive. I would have given the product 5 stars, but the mugs are stoneware, made in CHINA. The same kind of mugs could be had at a ""dollar store"" for...well...a dollar. This is a return to Corelle for me, having used it for many years, and thinking I needed to ""upgrade"" to nicer dishes. No more. I'm sticking with Corelle from now on..."
4,Good dishes,What can you say about Corelle? They do not break easily. Just good everyday dishes. Arrived promptly and in good condition.
3,I WANTED TO BE MORE WOWED,"I ORDERED THIS A COUPLE DAYS AGO, I LOVED THE COLOR. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WITH IT IS I THOUGHT THE BOWLS WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER, AND THE MUGS A LITTLE BIT THICKER. OTHER THAN THAT I WAS VERY SATISFIED."
4,Good dishes that take up little space,"We paid a good price for these dishes and really like them. When the plates and bowls are stacked, they take up little room in the cabinet. They are light weight and all fit in the dishwasher as well."
5,Corning,"I love Corelleware, this plain pattern is perfect for everyday and can be dressed up just as easily. It was a great price for a great product."
4,Corelle Livingware,"This set was exactly what I was looking for. Amazon had it for the best price around.There was a small chip on one of the dishes when it arrived so it shows these dishes are not indestructible, but pretty darn close. Since these will be used in our RV, their toughness and light weight make them perfect for the job."
5,GREAT price for a quality dish set,"This dish set I received looked exactly like the pictures. Its made of good quality, neautral colored, and came with a good selection. 4 cups, 4 Plates, 4 bowls, 4 smaller plates.I am very pleased with this purchase."
4,Corelle 16 piece Dinnerware Set,"I love the fact that this has a 3 year warranty if any of the pieces break. My 5 year has dropped a couple of them already and they didn't break. Also, when 1 of the plates came shattered, they exchanges without any problems. The plates get extremly hot in the microwave."
4,Beautiful set. Goes with everything. Wish mug bottoms were wider.,"Lovely dish set. No one needs to know - or will guess how little you paid.I wish the mugs had bases just as wide as the rims (the base is just slightly narrower)- which makes me a tad hesistant with the coffee placed right next to the computer (tipping risk just a smidge higher) but that's my only miff with the product.The color is very true ""international foods vanilla coffee creamer"" color - really, go make coffee and add some creamer - there ya go. Warmer than the photo, but not darker. Perfect.Although dinner plates are very very large and the salad plates are very very small(for me) being more like snack plates - I am happy with this purchase however. Very."
4,"Good Value, but Very Plain","These is an excellent set comprised of dishes and bowls and cups that are very difficult to break. It's sort of a cross between ceramic and glass, but it has the texture of glass.I was a little disappointed a this, because I thought Sandstone meant that it would have that grainy sort of ceramic texture (like sandstone!). However, the color is sandstone, and the set has no texture at all. It is glass smooth. This makes it easy to clean, but not as attractive as I would have liked. The overall effect, is that the dinnerware set is very plain.Extremely functional, but still plain."
4,Nice dishes,"I was very pleased with these dishes and am glad I ordered two sets so I have service for eight. They were delivered almost immediately, were very well packaged and complement other dishes with designs on them. They are light weight which is a blessing for those with arthritis. Made of a glass material, not melamine. And I love the mugs. Just the right size for that morning cup of coffee or afternoon tea. Microwavable, fit in the dishwasher and the price was right."
4,A Breif History ...,"Visually this book is beutiful - well designed and layed out, great photographs and excellent printing - I prefere the lack of glare from an uncoated paper. I like the text all in the front and the pics seperate. After reading The Conrete Wave I realized that Dysfunctional is very breif in the telling of the history of skateboarding. Although, it does have some interesting things Michael Brooke didn't document. There's a great collection of skate deck graphics throughout the book that doesn't go back far enough in time - it looks like it starts in the mid-to-late 80s. Also a great collection of old magaine covers and advertisements is included. What I dislike about both books is that you need to reference a glossary in th back to find out what a photographs all about. Well worth the price and a good addition to a skaters library - oldschool or new alike."
1,Adele-Fire and Rain: The Story Unauthorized Documentary,"This video is no good. It is only three videos probably taken from You Tube. It has one written page telling about her awards, and another written page saying she is a female and from Great Britain. My advice is not to buy this video. I am an Adele fan, this video was a let down."
1,Huge disappointment,"The other reviews were completely accurate but unfortunately I hadn't readthem before purchasing this at my grocery store. Adele is not the problem. The problem is the""production"" crew if there even was one. I agree with the other reviewers that quite possiblythese were amateurs who found these ""interviews"" on YouTube and then copied them onto a DVD.Adele even looked skeptical with their lame and repetitive questions. The sound, lighting and setting are sub par as well. The DVD cover looked slick, but this DVD is a joke. I am going to try to return it..."
1,rubbish,what a waste of time and money!! downloaded interviews taken from tv and put on disc....nothing new anywhere. A total load of crap. Dont even think of wasting your money on this.
1,Adele desrves better....,Didn't know a thing about Adele until I saw her perform in London the day before the royal wedding. Not only did her voice knock my socks off I really enjoyed her zest for life....no matter where it takes her. Humble ansd hilarious ! OY ! Saw this DVD and bought it and was LIVID. I was prepared for a interview but this is something someone made in their basement. To say it is awful is to kind. Save your money. A legit bio will be coming now that she stole the Grammys. And she deserved everyone of them!
2,Not so loud shorty,"For the price, I expected a lot more horn. Loud it was not. Maybe mine was defective inside, but cheap chrome plated plastic cover and horn did nothing to inspire confidence. The mounting tab, although stainless (maybe), was also of light gauge metal and the horn flexed a lot when mounted. Worth a hundred bucks? Not in my opinion. So when mine went ""murrrp"" instead of ""HOOONNKK"", it earned a return trip to Amazon for some other replacement product instead."
4,A good film that makes you think,"There are some things that have to be put to the light of day in order to destory it. This story about a young spirited girl who found that life can be very cruel and that even betrayal can come from those that are suppose to protect you always from the dark shadows. This little girl whose only hero was her cousin was forced into an outdated and outlawed tradition. CSI and Law and Order is more detailed in what bad things can happened to children. Every cultural has it's shame hidden among it's beauty. One of the reviews beg to keep this film hidden. I hope that they will reconsider and not hide away this ugly stain but to expose it so that young girls like ""Maya"" will not have to endure the enforced rape that is consented by parents as an ""honorable"" ritual. As an American, I didn't know about this ritual and actually searched for information on it. I understand better even though it sickens me that something can happen like this."
1,It made me want to vomit...,"This film will break your heart, especially if you're a girl/woman. I don't know much about the culture depicted in the film, but I sincerely hope with all my heart NO LITTLE GIRL ever has to suffer in real life, as the main character in this film did. There was information at the end of the film which stated that these type of rituals still happen in various parts of India. To watch a child be put through it actually made all of the pleasant scenes of the film completely disappear for me. I felt so very bad for her, I cried... It was too terrible and horrible. Her innocence was stolen from her, and she was just a baby! The men who took part in the ritual should have the offending member of their bodies removed."
1,Please don't buy this movie,"I picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie isbased on a rape of a little girl that the parents knowingly take their daughter to. My first thoughts were that I have never been more ashamed to be an Indian as well as a Hindu. I found this movie to be down right appalling. Please don't waste your time. As for the music, there are at most 2 horrible songs and the film used is cheap. The beautiful scenes are not what India is known for. I just hope that I have shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is. Yes it may highlight how evil people in power especially when it comes to religion may be, but to sit down and watch almost 2 hours of this movie can make almost anyone gag. If your up for a good Indian movie watch something by director Mira Nair."
4,Must Have Reading For Classical Pentecostals,"This book is a must have for those of the Classical Pentecostal position (that speaking in tongues is the initial, physical evidence of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit).The book is edited by the late Wade Horton, former General Overseer of the Church of God (Cleveland, TN). The various authors reflect the traditions of the Church of God and offer different insights into speaking in tongues.The book traces the history, practice, and biblical understanding of speaking in tongues. It also presents a sound doctrine of the person and work of the Holy Spirit."
2,so so,This product is 10 years old that I didn't know it when i bought it. I wanted the version that you could play online for a short time. I don't like how Vanna is on hosting too much and why does there have to be prizes on the wheel. I don't care about the prizes and what I can't win anyways.
4,"High quality, easy to set up, what more could one ask?","Combo units sometimes get a bad rap because people assume that having everything together in one box compromises the quality one could have by buying a TV, VCR and DVD as separate components. With this Toshiba unit, there is absolutely no compromise, because everything is first rate. The flat screen TV renders an outstanding picture and the quality of the VCR and DVD are as good as if one would have purchased them separately. The remote, however, could be improved. The DVD controls are non-intuitive, and difficult to read. It took me watching about six movies before I could navigate my way easily around the menus. Thus, because of the remote, I can't give it a five-star rating. Otherwise, this is a great purchase, and kudos to Amazon[.com] for shipping it about a month before I expected it!"
4,Great picture; good DVD player; space saver,"When the TV/VCR combos first came out 10 years ago, I was skeptical. It seemed like more could go wrong. But the higher end manufacturers have maintained high quality in the combo products. Toshiba produces great televisions, and this TV/DVD/VCR combo carries on the tradition.The flat screen is a great picture. I'd say it's close to Sony Trinitron quality, though Sony WEGA still beats it. The DVD player works great. The unit has front A/V jacks, supports games and multiple video input devices (digital and/or video cameras, another VCR, etc.). Sound quality is surprisingly good, though I still run it through my stereo system when we're watching movies.This is the best combo system I've seen from the major manufacturers. The picture is better, it looks better, and it weighs less."
3,OK if you like yellow facial skin,"This TV has many great qualities, but all types of facial skin have a yellowish color, like they have on yellow blush. Also the VCR records poorly. When the recorded program is played back, the picture is extremely poor. The DVD works great. The sound is acceptable. I'm going to return my Toshiba. I hope they all aren't like this."
1,VERY POOR PACKAGING,"First, this is a great combo TV. BUT, do not order on line. I purchased this set in May, 2002 for $475 from Amazon, and it took three deliveries and three months to arrive undamaged. The first set was so bad, UPS would not deliver, due to broken glass. The plastic shell was broken on the second set delivered by a common carrier. Finally, the third set delivered by DLP was Ok.The packaging from Toshiba is the typical exterior cardboard, with interior styrofoam on the ends, but the center is virtually unprotected. At the time I was saving about $100 (including delivery) from Best Buy - Not worth the headaches....."
1,Would Not Recommend,"I have owned this television for 2 1/2 years and have had to get it repaired twice. When there is a power outage, even if you have it plugged into a surge protector, when the power is restored it blows out the television. Toshiba has done nothing to help in this matter and repair costs have come out of my pocket. I wouldn't recommend buying any Toshiba products since their costumer service is unresponsive to complaints and resolving issues."
3,DVD Player Doesn't Like DVD-R's/Remote is Terrible,"Image and picture on tv are good. Control is terrible. I don't know if toshiba just doesn't put remotes through usability testing or what. The Yellow color for the dvd functions are impossible to see in anything other then bright light.The dvd player doesn't like to play certain types of DVD-R media including Sony, Imation and or TDK...so if you have home movies on dvd-r you will have issues."
1,Sale of non-available product,"I ordered this item for my in-laws and was informed that it wouldbe shipped in a reasonable period of time. I then checked history to find it was on back order. Two days later I checked to find my order had been cancelled (with no e-mail notice). On contacting Tech Depot, I was informed the product was not available,..."
4,dremel diamond bur/bit,"appears to be authentic dremel diamond bit. bought this one to use to engrave my initials onto my tools. i wanted a bit that was a lil better quality than the cheaper diamond bits available, for this specific use. it came in the dremel retail packaging, just like ya find in any brick & mortar. i only gave it 4 stars because i have a bias for another brand when i need bits/burs for my professional work."
4,A journey back to East Prussia,"I actually came across this book while I was in Germany and was trying to find information of Kr. Pr. Eylau, where my father was born. The author was born in the same village, and has traveled to the former East Prussia a number of times, and has published several books on East Prussia. In this book, which largely consists of pictures, he returns to the place of his birth. The pictures are quite telling of how things fell apart under Communism, and how much of the former German character of the region was obliterated."
3,Not the best,After seeing Futue 2 Future live in Philadelphia and listening to the Cd. I find the cd and concert very unevent. Many of the selections do not translate well in the a live profermance Much of it is rehash of better fusion music of the 70's (Miles Davis e.g.).
3,Half-way there,"Herbie Hancock is synonomous with jazz, and the frontier of jazz.Herbie's album - Gershwin's World, I thought was a great step into the future of jazz, and this album is a lot less than it could be. I can almost hear what Herbie's trying to do, but it is a far cry from the creativity that flows from Herbie's vast mind in the past. Buy the album, but in my opinion, Herbie could have waited a little longer, and presented, to his fans, a far grander album."
1,Absolute Garbage,"I was very disappointed with this offering from Herbie. I have followed him for over 20 years and I'll be honest I think he is getting less imaginative as he gets older. Anybody that says this is break through stuff is obviously very young and doesn't remember his stuff from the '70s. The last decent album was '94 ""Dis is da Drum"". With this latest effort I just think he's trying to attract a younger listener and it doesn't work. Let the younger musicians produce the hip-hop... Herbie's not from the streets and he's certainly not from the future. Sorry Herbie - I love you, but this one is terrible. Just my opinion."
1,Funk Skunk,Poor Herbie! He's been doin' too many TV commercials. This CD is totally brain dead. It's unimaginable the same composer came up with Maiden Voyage and Head Hunters. You do NOT want to add this to your collection. It belongs in the recycle bin at your local land fill!MG
1,product not received,"It's hard to rate a product that I have never received. I ordered this over a month ago. I tried tracking it through the Amazon website but get a message telling me ""no tracking information available"". I received a confirmation from Amazon on Nov 9th letting me know my Visa had been charged, but have yet to receive the video. Doubt I will order from this seller again."
1,defective,"just because about half way through it had a defect and did not play anymore, and also I did not know that it would be in Italian"
2,The Continuing Misinterpretation of Victorian Style,"Ms. Livingston's credentials suggest she possesses more than a layman's understanding of Victorian style. Unfortunately, the images she's chosen to populate this book with prove otherwise. This book contains only a few truly Victorian rooms. Most shots are of badly overdecorated Colonial Revival interiors, replete with contemporary furnishings. Worst of all, several of these so called ""Victorian"" rooms are in fact Arts and Crafts in style, a direct revolt against Victorianism. This VictorianISH at best."
5,Flame and the arrow,I would recommend this Burt Lancaster movie pack as it is a fabulous collection of Burt Lancaster movies. I saw The Flame and the Arrow when I was 12 years old and to see it again is just wonderful. It has not lost any of the action and thrill I have experience as a boy. For years the action sequence of the circus act and the dancing boy has stayed with me and I have recalled it every now and then. This maybe pure nostalgia but it is really a very good wholesome action movie.
4,Burt Lancaster Collection,"The main reason I bought this was because it had the movie< ""Seven Days In May."" Excellent movie in my opinion. Good drama.A couple of the others weren't bad, just ok."
3,closed captions,those of us old enough to appreciate the work of Burt Lancaster and his contemporaries are sure to have hearing problems-normal as we age. Captions are a necessity to appreciate the dialogue and acting. The price is right and maybe that is why there are no captions?
3,What's the aspect ratio?,Amazon says all these movies are 1:33 to 1. I have no interest in SEVEN DAYS IN MAY 1:33 to 1. The movie was made 1:85 to one.
5,great book for young tots!,"I bought this for my eldest son (5 yr old) when he was one and he never tired of it...it's now my youngest son's favorite book (16 months old) - this book is great for active tots who have a hard time sitting through ""longer"", less-interactive books; they will want to sit for this one - the flaps are huge, the words are simple, the colors are bright, and the reader can play with the animal sounds. Well worth the investment!"
5,Great for first interest in books,"We could not get our 11 month-old son interested in any books.We felt terrible that we weren't reading to him as much as wedid to his 3 yr. old sister when she was one. Then we happenedupon this book and our son was instantly enthralled by it.The large, vividly colored illustrations are captivatingand the text is simple, but fun. Another beautiful thing wasthat our 3 year-old could now ""read"" the story to her brothersince it was so predictable. I recommended it to [a local bookstore] and they know stock the book in our local store."
2,Peek-a-Moo!Peek-a-Moo!,"Peek-a-Moo!From the ten books I have read, my favorite book of all of them is Peek-a-Moo! by Marie Torres Cimarusti. I really liked this book because of the bright colors and the big illustrations. Peek-a-Moo! Has huge pictures with a really peek-a-moo motion. This book is great for all ages; It is also a great big activity book. All the pages have something to flip up and down. If I would have read it to my daughter I know she would of liked it too, just like me. This book helped me to be more animated and active with my kids by showing action and reading at the same time. By Christine)"
3,"Your toddler will love it, but the flaps will tear!","Your little one will have plenty of fun pulling down the flaps in this colorful book. However, the large flaps in Peek-a-Moo! are thick paper and therefore easily tear and crease. Also, if you have a toddler who does not want or understand to close the flap back up with each page (such as the case with our 14-month-old daughter), you need to make sure the flaps are back up before you turn the page. Otherwise, they will hang out the bottom of the book, vulnerable to further damage from the wrath of an active toddler. We have other lift-the-flap books that have smaller, thicker flaps that automatically close when you turn the page (such as Dear Zoo--highly recommended), which are in much better condition."
5,Standard First Birthday Gift,"My daughter has loved Peek-a-Moo and Peek-a-Zoo since she's been 8 months (or even younger--I can't remember when she didn't love these books!). She's 20 months old and still loves to look at the books, although now she reads them without me! The only downfall is that these books are paper and naturally they have been ripped up and scotch taped back together. I have given these two books to about 6 one year olds to delighted parents."
2,eh,"I was hoping that this was good,but instead it was mighty boring. I thought I would like it,cause I like history stuff,but I did not."
2,Couldn't even finish it.,"I was hoping this would be something similar to the diary of Kate Cumming, but it was very disappointing. In fact, I couldn't even finish it. It seemed somewhat superficial after reading Kate's diary."
3,Good Story,"Written from the Confederate side of the war, this story is of a girl and her family who are trying to survive during the Civil War."
4,Ordinary people in times of war,This view of the civil war was so different than the historic military tales and the slave recounts. It gave insight into what the ordinary southern person suffered during the war.
2,Reader,"Oh please, please, please. Oh my, my, my. It's hard for a Confederate belle to leave her world with so very few pretty dresses."
5,Buy this recording!,"As a musical theatre nut, I am always in search of another recording of a show no one knows about. I have many ""duds"" in my collection, but this one is a treasure... one I keep quite handy and always available to pop in the player and never grow tired of.Being a huge fan of Carolee Carmello, I could hardly wait to open this CD and play it. What I experienced was an incredible range of emotions.. laughter, tears, sadness and joy. This show is one that is not to be missed. Carolee's performace is wonderful as usual. She is able to shade her voice with many nuances that many performers today can't do. Many singers just sing the notes as written. Carolee makes you FEEL them.It's a shame this show is not more popular, because it should be. The score is so well written and deserves much more attention than it gets.Go buy this CD... you won't be disappointed!"
5,"Amazing story, wonderful music","I had the opportunity to perform in this show twice as well as direct it once. A year later, I still have the music in stuck in my head! Andrew Lippa has created a wonderful show about family, growing up, life and love. The music is richly melodic and surprisingly lush considering the cast of two is backed by a piano, 'cello and percussion!"
1,To parody one of her songs: An act of a SICK mind.,I feel sorry for this Woman. She must be absolutely miserable.
1,Dull and lifeless,"This book reminded me a lot of Moorcock's Elric series. It's extremely brief, the characters are lifeless, the world is poorly described, and it takes itself way too seriously.The protagonist, Paul Formain, is so cold and lifeless that he makes Elric seem emotional by comparison.One expects a sci-fi novel to have lifeless and cliched characters, but there's usually a cool interesting scientific idea to counter the lack of character development and story. Necromancer has neither. In fact, it's more of a fantasy story than true sci-fi. The characters have magical abilities which are never explained in any kind of logical or scientific way.Now I have no problem with fantasy, but as a fantasy novel Necromancer doesn't hold up either. A fantasy story should have interesting characters and a well developed fantasy world. Necromancer has none of this.I really have nothing good to say about this book."
3,Super Reader,"This is not a direct sequel as such. No zombies, either. A man loses an arm in an accident when he fails to take heed of his 'danger sense'. He then gets involved in an organisation that has 'Alternate Laws' they believe in, and tell him he can regenerate his arm.They have plans for him and his talent, they think they can use him as an agent to destroy the technologically assisted utopia they live in, that is still full of problems."
3,"A Fun, Fast Paced, Unique, Fantasy Thriller","I read this book as an adolescent and flew through it. I picked the book solely on the title, which was never really explained in the story. It has alot of action in it. It has major plot holes, and at one point the author forgets that the main character is missing an arm. The plot involves magic, psychological manipulation, and halucinations. The environment isn't well-developed, but like many 10 cent paperbacks, has a few intriguing concepts and stimulators that make it a fun read. I'd compare this book with one of Andre Norton's minor books. It's a great escape!"
3,Contractor PA,It says it will do 180 degree bends. I tried to get 180 and the hole where the pipe went in for 90 degree bends hit the cutter arm. I had to grind the one side and fix the hole for the 90 degree cause I bent it in a little. Nice tool otherwise.
3,Not so happy,"The tool works fine, only problem is it showed up miss the most important bolt the one that pivots the cutting jaw. And the kicker is it came with no info on the manufacturer to correct it, and no easy to contact Amazon either. Long story short I had to fix it myself. Sucks dont it!"
4,Agressive tool clogs easly,A bit too agressive for softwoods and many plastics. Clogs easily on softer materials and is difficult to clean. Great for fiberglass and PC boards and hard woods though.
5,Great tool if used at the right speed,"This tool performed exceptionally for me. I referred to the guide that came with my dremel 4000 to find the right speed for the material being worked and it did a great job of hogging out large amounts of material with little load. If you don't use the tool at the optimum speed or have the bit too deep in the cut then the life of the tool and it's performance will fall drastically, which is probably the issue in the reviews above. Running the bit too fast with plastics and soft metals will cause the material being worked to actually melt and fuse to the teeth of the bit. If you run the bit too deep or too fast then the bit will load up, over heat, and ultimately degrade the strength of the tool.To sum it up, using this bit at the correct speed and making multiple passes rather than jamming it into the workpiece for large amounts of material removal should yield beautiful results."
3,wears out very fast,works great for the first 30 seconds of cutting plastic but looses its cutting ablity by half.
2,Looked Cheap to Me...,Not real impressed so I sent it back. I think it is prettier online. Looked cheap to me...
4,A Gift for my mom,My mother had the original Ab-Doer and when she saw this she had to have it. So I ordered it. It doesnt make as much noise as the first one when you use it. Guess you have to use it more often for it to work without noise to be honest. But she loves it so I like it.
4,Second best Bruckner 9,"This is very special, spiritual, music; very well played; superbly recorded. I enjoy it immensely, although I feel that Jochum in my worn-out DG LP has a slight edge on performance."
5,A book to read... time and time again!,"I've bought this book a little while back and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's actually not out of print or hard to obtain, perhaps Amazon got that bit wrong, don't know. I found the story entertaining, and Ms. Knights handles her time machine with skill. The characters were well developed and loveable and I've just discovered another book by her, called Starchild, from the same publisher. I particularly liked the idea of the time machine messing with the people's heads, which sometimes became rather embarrassing and funny. If you like Time Travel Romance, you shouldn't miss this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
3,Starman Soundtrack,Expected more of the main theme throughout the selections - This soundtrack brings back the memories of watching the movie in real time. I like the fact that it is all music and no voices.
5,Help evolve children,Great book on neuroscience and the brain and how it relates to learning capabilities on childrens.Drwas a lot from eastern and western aproaches to cognitive deveolpment.
2,Good information.,The information is good but I thought I was getting the newer version of the book. Instead I was sent an older version and the pictures are not very helpful. I was very disappointed.
3,Not what I expected...,"The book has good information, but mostly pertains to older kids. I was hoping for information on pre-K and Kindergarten-aged kids."
5,Simply Amazing!!!!,"Five Stars! My son is earning 100% test scores in school this year since we have been doing these safe, simple Brain Gym movements together every day as described in the latest new and revised version of the Brain Gym Teacher's Edition. The descriptions of the movements and how to do them are clear and easy to follow. The photographs and graphics in the manual are attractive and inviting. This book, written for anyone who wants to know the theory behind and purpose of each activity, is easy to read and follow. For the classroom teacher there are variations for special needs, games to play and many ideas for creating a joyful atmosphere for optimal learning. I wish I had had the Brain Gym activities in school when I was a child. I am sharing this exciting work with everyone I know!"
4,Inspiring,"For the last few months, I've been more and more interested in neuroeducation and the Brain Gym - Teacher's edition - seemed like a logical reading in my exploration of the subject. I'm not done reading it yet, but I'm eager to try some of these techniques with my students, which are actually young adults. They are stuck on their chair all day long and I'm convinced that they will only benefit from such exercises. Overall, exercises are well-explained, but certain notions are not very well defined (i.e. the midfield...) Maybe it's because english is not my first language, being actually a french-speaker. But this book remains an interesting addition to whoever wants to help students feel more comfortable for learning in the classroom environment."
2,Not up to standard!,"Although the content is very interesting, the quality of the graphics, typesetting and production is terrible! The illustrations are all line drawings by an amateur, and poorly illustrate the movements and postures described in the text. If the publishers didn't have a monopoly on the content, they simply couldn't get away with such a low standard. Considering the premium price point for this slender tome, one should expect a higher standard."
3,Poor introduction,"I have never practiced Brain Gym. A special ed teacher recommended I buy a copy to use in my own class. So..of course, I bought the Teacher's Edition. The problem - it has VERY poor directions on how to do the original exercises!! It assumes you KNOW the exercises and have a copy of the original ""Brain Gym"" manual. I don't!! And I have a hard time believing that such a big seller would have such poor directions/illustrations of exactly what to do/what to avoid in the physical activities.Lots of tips on how to specialize the exercises for different kids but WITHOUT bothering to give one very good directions on how to do the exercises. I am VERY disappointed. There are also LOTS of references to their other books (for you to buy)."
2,Problems,"Needs re-organization, editing, and new graphics. Looks self published by a 3rd grader? Some useful info but not much direction as to how to apply it? As a 'Teachers Edition' it should give detailed info as to how to organize and present the exercises. Graphics are very poor."
3,Should have bought a diffrent edition,"I bought this because I read that Brain Gym was good for kids with special needs. Never having seen it done or used any other Brain Gym products- I naturally ordered the TEACHERS EDITION, thinking all the directions would be there for implementing this is my classroom. This manual would be for someone already familiar with the basics of Brain Gym exercises who wanted to find creative ways to use it within a classroom setting. I will be looking for Brain Gym products that meet my needs better."
4,No closed captioned CC,"DuDu Fisher in concert from Israel. Great video as seen on PBS with a few additions. My only complaint, which incidentally is very important for me is that closed captioned is not provided. Very disappointing.In Concert From Israel [DVD]"
3,pot,this book is mostly for people who smoke not eveyday. What i'm trying to say as a pot head myself i know that if i just read this book i will still be on bud. It's just mainly for the people who just smoke 4 times out of the month.
3,"Nice picture, but terrible remote","I wish I had read one of the other reviews that discussed problems with the remote prior to purchasing this tv. It is amazing in this day and age that the remote doesn't have a mute button. It is also amazing that it seems no universal remote will work on this model Toshiba. Who wants to be stuck using two remotes? Well, you will have to use two if you buy this tv. I contacted Toshiba to see if any universal remotes work with this tv, and they stated they did not know. I also complained to them about the lack of a mute button, and that their remote is not a universal remote. They responded to my e-mail, but they did not seem to really care about my complaints. I think I would have done better if I bought the comparable Panasonic television. The only plus to the Toshiba, is that it does have a nice picture."
3,Pretty Good,"It is a pretty good deal. I am dissappointed that it arrived slightly damaged and I have not been able to get a replacement. They told me that it was no longer in stock, but I see it is still being sold, so go figure."
3,no remote,"it is a beautiful tv. no remote is maddening. the picture is okay, but it could be better. i am suprised toshiba left off so many things, but if you can live with it, buy the tv."
1,No Mute?!,"As impossible as it is to believe, there is no mute button on this unit. Fortunately we figured this out before setting up the TV and saved the necessary effort of extensive repacking before returning it to the store. The mute button on the remote is more than just a convenience - it is the manufacturer's sole effort to prove they are on our side in the continuous battle between ever-intrusive advertisers and ad-saturated consumers. Obviously Toshiba has moved to the dark side in this battle."
5,No-Staples stapler,Works well - Will not stitch more than 5 pages together (Just as advertised) - Easily separate pages after stitching if necessary - Great item!
5,"Easy to use, no waste.","I wanted to try a staple free stapler because it would mean one less thing to buy (staples). The product works well and is easy to use. I stapled my papers while seated at my desk, took no extra effort as a previous reviewer stated. It does make a small rectangular hole so you might not want to use for everything. For my purposes, it's great. It's also a little easier on the environment because I do not have to figure out a way to recycle metal staples (and who wants to deal with that?) or step on the ones that have fallen to the floor."
3,"Could have a purpose, but should not replace staples","I got this to replace my stapler but it is definitely not a product that can. If you need to put papers together that will later be shredded then this is a good option. But for permanent uses, stick with staples"
3,follow the directions and its great,"This is great for papers that need to be kept awhile and then will be shredded as it saves removing the paper clip. However the product says for up to 4 pages and it's true. If you do more sheets it jams and breaks - happened to us twice. Now everyone in the family is aware of this and I actually wrote ""4 sheets Max"" on it."
5,Awesome Little Gizmo!,This little stapler does the trick. Not only it is cute and compact but it doesn't waste staples or poke anyone. The stapler comes with an info. sheet stating that you should only staple four pages or less (I think) and this is accurate! I found out the hard way because I think I put five sheets of paper in and nearly broke the little thing while the papers got smashed in the stapler. I resurrected my Eco stapler and it works fantastically. I often have people snatching it from my desk to use it. Definitely worth the cheap price.
2,It's a fastener and not a stapler,It readily fastens two or three pages together but if you flip the pages to read them they will fall apart. This is more like a paper clip for two or three pages versus a stapler.
2,"Good idea, bad design","I loved the concept, the external design... but, I used for 6 pieces of paper... and thanks to the Lord I have the skill to disassemble and assemble again... other wise, 10 dollar to the garbage."
2,disappointed with staplet,"Unfortunately the ""staple"" is weak enough even with just two papers that as soon as you look at the second page the papers come apart. I was hoping for a better grip. I wouldn't buy this stapler if I had the chance again."
1,Waste of Money,"If you already have something to punch holes into paper, then you can use that instead of this buying this item. It's pure of waste of money. Not sure if I can return this item. If I can, then I would be glad to do that."
2,stapler,"Works ok, not the greatest. Works better on thinner paper. Not quite as good as a regular stapler but if you just need them held together and are not carrying them around a lot or passing them in to a teacher they will be fine. Good idea!"
4,An Interesting View of Railroad Diners,"I found this book to be interesting and enjoyable. It is a detailed history of dining car service aboard the Southern Pacific from the beginning of the service until the service was terminated...along with SP passenger service. I found the information on how food was obtained and stored, the use of commisaries, as well as preperation of food prior to departure to be an interesting look at how the railroads handled food service.The book was written in any easy style and is an enjoyable read. It is a bit pricey, but aren't most specialty books?"
2,Disappointing,The book is a disappointing review of the Southern Pacific food service from years ago. There is little review of receipes and little comment on foods served. It's more of a historical perspective of the railroad food services. It's an expensive book ofering little to the romance of railroads and dining.
1,Bad Wedding Band?,"I bought this cd without hearing it, unfortunately!!! The song titles made the cd look very promising, however the music is not very well produced & the over-powering vocals are out of sync with the wimpy music. I won't waste anymore of your time, you'll know what to do..."
3,good product but needs support,Purchased this product and I like it with one exception. Don't expect it to work over a VOIP line. Brother tech service was marginal and look over a week to reply.
3,Love it -- when it works,"When it works, we love it. But it doesn't always work! We've had the printer a long time, over a year for sure. After a few months, it quit responding to wireless print requests. Prints fine if we plug in as USB, but does nothing if we print over the wireless network. Downloading and installing new firmware fixed the problem -- for a few weeks, then the wireless print stopped again."
5,Good Product,"If you do not want to put a rubber bathmat in your bathtub to prevent slipping, these appliques are a great alternative. They attach and remove easily for cleaning and don't leave any marks on the tub, unlike their more permanent cousins.Highly recommended."
5,"Pierre Garand, better known as Garou...","Pierre Garand, better known as Garou... Magnificent music! Impressive voice! 5 stars all the way. Well worth the money. This CD is great, almost as good as ""Seul"".Short biography: Pierre Garand, better known as Garou, is a Quebec singer born on June 26, 1972 in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada."
3,"good,but could get better","The main story of this book was that Listener,the heroic main charecter,sets off from his home town Fraguland to find his grandfather,The Gentle Fluter.This book would've been more interesting,if: 1)There would've been some battles, 2)If Barlo could talk,he would've had some wonderful stories, and 3)The Tales in this book were just a tad bit longer.Otherwise,this is a good book and I enjoyed Hans Bemman's epic book."
2,Not very impressed,"This book started off to be a grand adventure, but somewhere along the way it just stopped being interesting."
5,"Mystical, and brilliant","I read this when i was 10, and loved the magic it contained, there are a lot of life lessons and morals to be learnt in this book. I have read it again as an adult at numerous times, always a lovely story, warning, you do need an imagination without limits!"
5,Beautiful - haunting - poignant - will stay with you forever,"I first read this book 9 years ago, and I've made it a point to read it once a year ever since. This book had a profound effect on me which I can't begin to describe unless you read it yourself. Listener is very much a flawed character - good intentions but has his selfish side which gets the better of him sometimes. Note; this is a LONG book, but it must be read slowly to get the full impact. The effects of the novel will linger with you for years after you read the final page."
5,My Favorite All-Time Fantasy Novel,"This book is epic and beautiful. Few writers could accomplish what Hand Bemman did here. This book is a triumph of storytelling. Read it and be blown away. I'm reading it again, all over again. Love it!!"
5,THIS BOOK IS GOOD; I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,"This book is the ultimate experience for people who don't only look for entertainment in a book. Don't get me wrong, it is not only entertaining, it literally blows you away. But the story evolving around Listener (Lauscher, in the original) has meaning. Every part of the book, every sub-plot (and there are many) has a message for the reader. I first read this book at the age of 10, and since then read the book once a year in it's german original. I have yet to experience the translation, but I honestly believe that a book as great as this can't loose anything in its translation. Buy it, read it, live it. No other book will ever capture your imagination as this one will.Five stars is not enough for this book: I give it a 10!!"
5,"Holy Releases, Batman, Five Stars!","My mom gave me this record when I was about six years old. I remember putting on the old Motorola console record player and waiting for some godforsaken dialogue already... but alas only music. In the ensuing years this record grew on me to the point that it has become one of my regular favorites. My brother sent me a copy of this recently and I was overwhelmingly pleased with the fact that someone took the time to remaster this piece. And bonus tracks too! You'll go wild for Evil Ekdol, the Sewer Lady and the Evil Plot to blowup Batman. Of note also are Holy Diploma Batman, and the Batchase. I must tell you, there's really nothing like zooming down the street in my 98 horsepower Saturn with the Batman theme or the Batchase playing. Try it!Here's a piece of trivia: who wrote the theme for the Odd Couple TV show? Just think - da-da da-da da-da da-da da-da - kinda similar, eh?"
2,A Promotional Oddity?,"I picked this up years ago thinking it was the original music from the Batman tv show - it isn't. Except for a swinging version of the iconic theme, it's the type of music that would have shown up in an Ironside episode featuring a ""rock"" band. And the cover - looking for all the world like the inner liner notes - offers little to no information.By the song list, it appears to be the original Neil Hefti album ""Batman Theme and 12 Hefti Bat Songs."" Or rather, a promotional copy of the album reissue on cd? It carries nearly the same release number as another Hefti Batman reissue - anyone have any clues?"
1,Disappointment,"I saw this CD and added it to the wish list, knowing little about it.Very disappointing, to say the least. There were few songs I could make it through without clicking for the next selection.So unpleasant, it's almost entertaining.Almost."
1,Did the cover say LotusScript?,"OK so maybe the cover did say LotusScript, but if you are a Notes Developer, FORGET THIS BOOK! The book has absolutly nothing that deals with Notes/Domino at all. Maybe if there are people out there that want to learn LotusScript for other products besides Notes, this MIGHT be ok. There is little more to say for Notes consultants besides look elsewhere!"
2,Not good for Lotus Notes,"I thought this book was good in teaching the basics of Lotus Script, as well as the basic concepts of any language. However, if you want to script in Lotus Notes, then forget about it. Not knowing ANYTHING about LotusScript, I got a good foundation of how to do things and what things are, but as far as using the editor, how to add your own subs and functions, etc., it was no help as Lotus Notes is different than WordPro! This did not help you to differentiate between Notes Classes at all, although it did teach you about classes in general. Bottom line: good for a basic background, but won't get you very far with Lotus Notes."
1,My rating is based on this book's usability with Lotus Notes,Do not buy this book if you're trying to learn LotusScript to use in Lotus Notes applications. It is focused more toward WordPro. I am a Notes developer and I didn't find the book useful at all.
5,My favorite voice!!,"I have been a fan for over 50 years, once owning almost all his albums (they were stolen). I am now in the process of replacing them, especially the Christmas albums. His voice is unforgetable and never loses it's appeal and charm. My daughters grew up listening to him and he is one of their favorites. This album epitomizes and showcases his voice. It's the only music on my Iphone and brings me to tears every time I listen. If you buy no other CD, you need this one."
1,It can hardly even engrave wood.,I hate this thing. It's over priced and flimsy at best during use. Avoid it. I have found the cheaper Chinese diamond engraving bits to be 10 times better.
4,Let's Engrave,This bit is much easier to deal with than the carbide bit. It produces a fine line and (hopefully) should last longer than its carbide counter point.
3,I used this bit to engrave in flagstone.,"I etch in flagstone, this diamond point bit did not hold up as well as the carbide bits I usually use."
5,I LOVED This Movie - Masters of Tap All the Way,How many times to you get to see such a work of art that incorporates old and new masters of all ages? One of the biggest surprises was the young kid who was very good. And Sammy was excellent in this pic. Add it to your collection before it disappears.
5,gregoryhinesfan,"WONDEFULL!!!!!!!!!!!! If you love the tap dancing, love stories, and the past and present tap dancers this is the movie for you. Although dancing takes place, this is not a ""musical"" or something on ""broadway"". This movie has a storyline and is highly recommended!!"
5,Tap is a must see!!!,"This movie will show you some amazing art of tap dancing.I am so glad the artists that are involved in this film.A DVD release of this film is a must with surround sound.Once you see the movie, you'll know what I mean."
3,"Pleasant, Light, Dancing Fare","I stumbled across this while getting over a cold and couldn't switch away from it. Whether that was due to the lethargy of sickness or a commentary on the film quality I wasn't sure. Gregory Hines plays a tap dancing ex-con who finds his way back into his old steps, both dance and burglary. The movie never gets too deep or preachy and retains its light hearted quality throughout. The tap scenes between Hines, his ex-girlfriend, and his 60 year old plus cohorts at the dance studio are very impressive. Sammy Davis Jr. stars in his last role as the ailing father of Hines' girlfriend, looking for one last big show before he taps off to the Candyman-land in the sky. Overall, a decent little film, very old fashioned in its pacing and delivery, I was surprised when it drew me in, but it did."
1,Tap from Amazon,"I was looking forward to seeing this film again. I had first rented the film. I loved Gregory Hines and all the veteran hoofers the movie portrays, many of them acting as themselves. Unfortunately what arrived was not the movie but two short musical pieces labelled and packaged as Tap. Because I was ripped off, I gave this purchase a low rating. Had it been the actual movie, I would have high fived it."
4,TAP DEFINETELY NEEDS TO BE RELEASED ON DVD,"I was extremely surprised that tap is not released on DVD. In fact it sucks that there is no DVD release. My name is Chris Richardson and Tap is one of my favorite movies. I am 25 years old and I still whatch this movie and I will never get sick of this movie. I am in the US Navy and I have no VCR, I only have a DVD player. I saw the movie on TV the other day and I need to own this movie but with it not released on DVD I can't and that sucks. Tap was a story of the life of a lot of tap dancers in the late 80's and even into the early 90's. The struggle of old and new tap dancers. This movie showed the world that tap dancing was in the process of changing with the times and young tap dancers were starting a whole new form of tap dancing, a new generation of tap dancers were mixing todays music with a new style of tap dancing and this movie helped to change the way that people thought of tap dancing. Please release this movie on DVD really soon."
3,Tapped Out,"If you want to see him dance, catch this by all means. Myself, although I liked his dancing, loved his acting. To see some of his best acting be sure to catch "" Off Limits"", ""Good Luck"", ""Eve of Destruction"", ""Running Scared"" , and ""White Nights""."
3,"Dancing Super, Story Not So Much","If it wasn't for the fact I've always enjoyed watching a good tap dancer, from Fred Astaire to Bill Robinson to Gene Kelly on here to Gregory Hines, I wouldn't have sat through all 111 minutes of this turkey. That's what the story is - a turkey with a bunch of angry, surly, unlikable characters who are no fun to listen to.What this REALLY is - and this part I like - is an excuse for Hines and fellow hoofers to strut their stuff. In fact, Hines puts on one of the best exhibitions of tap dancing I have ever seen. What's really fun is to see him and a some old men, former great dancers in their day, all together in a number or two. That's great stuff.So, if want to enjoy some super dancing, check this out."
4,"Watch for the dancing, not the plot","The dancing is amazing. Gregory Hines is the best, but the ""challenge"" number with the old legends is a real show stopper and by far the best part of the movie. Young Savion Glover is adorable. I only wish they had included more scenes of him dancing. The plot is pretty predictable and almost non-existent. But anyone who is watching this movie for the plot should go and watch something else."
5,top,les amis ou puis-je trouver le film tap dance en francais si possible ou en vo sous titre francais merci de m'envoyer un mail merci a tous les internautes qui pourrais me renseigner pour cette acquisition
1,dvd or vhs?,It is a Great movie but for some reason I thought it was a DVD instead of a VHS! Too bad.
5,Hard to describe the brilliance of this movie :-),"Wow. Apart from the fact that the late great Gregory Hines was one of the best tap dancers in the universe, this is an amazing movie. It has great music and the dancing is out of this world.I absolutely loved Gregory Hines and watched everything of his that I could. His dancing in this movie is so good. The storyline is Ok, but it's the rest of this that I love. I saw it on VHS about two years back and I cannot wait to purchase this when it comes out in August. While now it's very dated, it's still a musical and dance masterpiece. This is a must for all fans of tap or dance in general."
4,"I love this movie, it's in my top 10 fav's","If you are a fan of tap, dancing, good rhythm, toe tapping and cheering on an underdog, you will love this movie also! I think there was genius involved in using all the old greats, including Sammy! The story is a little weak, but who cares when the dancing starts? That's what this movie is all about.....and what a start for a promoting such a talent as young Mr Glover......"
5,A 10 Out of 10!,"Being a fan of Gregory Hines's work, this movie was the best he's ever done, to me. I knew within his history, he loved tap dancing. So this flick was right up his alley. The movie also had legendary tap dancers, including Sandman Sinks, and especially Sammy Davis Jr. Also (back as a kid, Savion Glover). The songs were great! Including one of my favorites, ""All I Want Is Forever"" from Regina King and James 'JT' Taylor. Overall, it is a classic!!"
5,Tap,"WOW!!! The DANCING in this movie is PHENOMENAL!!! I LOVE the scene when the are dancing in the streets of NYC as well as the closing scene when Gregory Hines solos. BUT my all-time, absolute favorite scene is when the ""old-timers"" show Gregory Hines that they still have legs! CHALLENGE!!! Love it! Love it!"
4,Tolman Rebar Cutter-Bender,"My experience thus far has been very good. The tool cuts and bends 1/2"" gr. 60 rebar with ease, even in wet and muddy conditions. I look forward to trying the tool on 5/8"" gr. 60 in the next few weeks."
5,The best dandruff shampoo,I have used many dandruff shampoos but Sebulex is the only one that has worked. I highly recommend this product for anyone who is feeling uncomfortable or embarrassed due to dandruff.
4,Works really well!,I was a skeptic at first. I tried so many other products but they didn't work for me. With Sebulex after a few applications my dandruff went away. Miracle! The reason why I only gave this product 4 stars is....wish it smelled a little better. It doesn't smell bad but it doesn's smell great either.
5,best shampoo in the world,"After 20 yrs + of using Sebulex CVS cancelled it on their shelf. Thank god Amazon picked it up. I now buy it buy the case.A doctor's recommnedation started me on the product and I have never used another.No flaking,no scratching, perfect for me."
4,It works,"It do works better than most shampoo products that I have tried. It has a wired smell, but it is not a very bad smell and is still tolerable. The only problem is that my hair become very dry after I used this, so I just keep conditioner on my hair longer than usual. I would give it 4.5 stars."
4,worked okay,"my son had a scalp issue...this product was okay but didn't provide the relief any better than other product. didn't smell very bad like other reviews claim, but a rinse with a good smelling conditioner did the trick."
2,The Sebulex Medicated Dandruff Shampoo was a big ...,The Sebulex Medicated Dandruff Shampoo was a big disappointment for me. I was really looking forward to it controlling my dandruff. But it was very drying on my scalp and on my hands as well. (My hands were left feeling very dry and irritated.) The shampoo also did nothing to control my dandruff. The smell was OK and it didn't bother me. That was the only thing that was appealing about the product. I'd definitely look for another product to control my dandruff. I'd never recommend this product!
5,I LOVED this shampoo. It worked well to ...,"I LOVED this shampoo. It worked well to control flaking and smelled nice. I'd buy this again AND I'd recommend it to anybody with a dry, flaking scalp!"
4,works,"Just after one shot, all of my flanks gone!!!! But I also noticed my fair became a little strange,drier and rougher. I do not know what will happen in the long turn, I may try to use another shampoo in intervals"
3,Didn't work for me,I was hoping it would work for me like it did the others but it did not even reduce it.
1,I didn't notice any difference at all when ...,"I didn't notice any difference at all when using this shampoo. I normally use Denorex as needed for dandruff, and I see results almost immediately. I certainly wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
2,Bought it for cradle cap,"Hmmm.....wasn't that impressed with the overall effectiveness with helping my son's cradle cap. His doctor recommended it, but I think it caused my son's hair to fall out. I'm sure it works well on adult heads though"
3,Quality lacking,"When I got this binder, I noticed the covering was ""plastic"" and rigid, not rubbery and giving, so I figured that's why -- right out of the box -- the binder had cracked in a 1-inch spot on the underneath edge seam. I shrugged, not willing to write this binder off yet. But now, after only a couple of uses, I'm noticing another spot that's also cracked. The material does not flex, so it cracks easily. If it wasn't for the poor quality of the covering, I would rate this 5 stars based on the ""one touch"" mechanism of the metal rings and its quality. Disappointed that more care wasn't taken to give this ""heavy-duty"" binder true durability."
3,Too much Technical detail!,"I have read many of his books and loved almost all of them! This was okay but I felt it dragged too much ! The parts that were good , were really good, but the rest was way too much jargon and detail I felt a lot could have been left out and still remain a good book, shorter but better! The way it starts , you think it is going to be about that subject but to me it went way off track this time!"
4,"Great as always, miss Detective Sturgis as a leading role","I've read many in this series and this one is very good. It doesn't move quite as fast as some, and I would like to see more of Detective Sturgis. The two characters together really make the stories."
5,Good!,Always good books written by Jonathan Kellerman. He is a wonderful writer and I love the Alex Delaware novels. He is adding new people which may or may not carry forward to other books and it keeps it interesting. This series should be read from book one all the way through to the end!
3,Interestting topic,The topic was interesting but I had a hard time getting through the middle of the book. The end was very good but the middle could have been shorter.
3,Searching for a 'monster parent',"This is a good page-turner about psychologist sleuth Alex Delaware. In thismystery he is looking for a 'monster parent' - someone committing Much-ausen by Proxy on their child. This means that the parent is faking medicalsymptoms in their child by intentionally harming them.The mystery also involves hospital politics, sundry murders, and romanticintrigue.It is very good until the ending. The characters are never explored much soyou're left with the big 'why?'. If Kellerman can do more character develop-ment, it would be a tremendous improvement."
1,WHAT AM I MISSING?,"This is my first Alex Delaware novel and I don't understand why Kellerman has such a following. While I found the premise of the story, Munchausen by proxy, interesting, I was frustrated by the overwriting. Take a hundred and fifty pages from this book and you still have the same story.There is too much unnecessary detail. Conversations go on and on and on to no end.Kellerman seems to have a need to force every social issue into his story regardless of whether it is part of the story or not.Does he always write like this or did I just pick the wrong book to test the waters?I did not find the book thrilling,suspensful or mysterious. Just tedious."
4,A good suspenseful read,"As a tremendous fan of Kellerman and his protagonist, child psychologist Dr. Alex Delaware, I found this book's premise to be promising - munchausen syndrome by proxy, the intentional injuring of a child by the parent(s) (or sometimes nurses) to gain attention. Although the book loses a little steam compared to his previous books, especially for those who have never met the main characters, the simple idea that a plot can be suspenseful without involving a medical examiner or a detective or a lawyer makes his books not only necessary, but instantly refreshing."
3,Overdetailed,"Perhaps the author is paid by the word, we get full details of carpet color and type, wallpaper colors, the artwork, name dropping at its worst, medical terms that I didn't know and weren't explained,Kellerman seems to get to the heart of the mystery too soon and then it drags and drags to the end, it will help the insomniacs to get some rest though."
5,Another J.K. book,"Well, another great Jonathan Kellerman book, here, I'll tell you about it.When Alex gets a call from a doctor from a hospital where he used to work, asking for help, he agrees. When he goes, he finds that things have changed, and the hospital is a little dangerous. He is asked to avaluate a young couple who brings their young child in, with a range of sicknesses, almost every night, and the doctor suspects that they are making their own child sick. But Chip Jones and his wife are pleasent people, not at all the type to try and hurt their daughter. But Alex must find out soon, before a innocent child is harmed"
3,Not one of his best,As I started reading this book by him it came apparent that this was not going to be a good book. Through the whole book I was expecting Dr. Delaware to show up but he never did and it was a disappointment
1,"Not the item pictured, Buyer Beware",I ordered this after reading reviews that the new curlesuque version wasn't very good. I ordered what is described as TIGI catwalk curls. I received TIGI curlesque. Super disappointed. Unfortunately for me I didn't realize until yesterday that the bottle I was using was the curlesque.
1,Not the same as the old Curls Rock!,"This is NOT the same and doesn't do for my curls what the old Curls Rock did. If you like the old one, you'll be disappointed in this."
3,Ehhh,"Smells really good, but it does tend to leave your hair a little crunchy, which is what i was trying to avoid. Still use it in the summer. With the humidity the crunch isn't so bad and it keeps my hair from getting frizzy."
3,Not the best but,"Not a miracle product but definitely helped my hair from getting crazy and super frizzy, the product itself looks like elmers glue, so I can see how one of the other reviews said it caused a flaking dandruff look,I have not had this issue so far"
3,Leaves hair kind of stiff,"This stuff is a cream that comes out fast and thick. It didnt really do what I was suspecting, but I'm new to hair products, so maybe i'm dumb about it. For my hair, which is thick and curly ringlets, it separate the ringlets, and stayed kind of crunch all day. Also, a little of this stuff goes a long way."
2,Do Not Use EVER.,"I have thick, tight, corkscrew curly hair. This stuff was AWFUL in my hair and I agree with most of the other posts. It doesn't hold your hair at all and does give it a straw like texture. I actually haven't found a Tigi styling product I'm completely happy with yet. I have used the CatWalk Curls Rock Curl Booster. I loved this product, BUT it did leave a build-up after awhile. I found that if I used it every other day that that would help up with the build-up (It stays in your hair for a looong time). Probably going to give the S Factor Smoothing a try."
3,"Love this product, but....","I have to say I love, love this product. I have been looking for something like this for years. It makes my curl form beautifully, without weighing them down or looking like I have an oil slick of product on my hair. Unfortunately, it made my forehead break out. I couldn't figure out what was causing the little bumps on my forehead because I have never had problem skin. This had been going on for 3 months and finally I decided to take a vacation from this product, and it has cleared up. I am so very disappointed because I thought I had finally found the best product out there for curly hair. :("
2,Doesn't tame the frizz & leaves a little crunchy and dry,I have been using this product for several months and the more I use it the less I like it. I have wavy/curly normal hair and bought this based on the reviews on this site. I wish I had read the review that the formula changed to contain alcohol because this is the WORST thing that you can put on curly hair! Wavy/Curly hair needs moisture. Now I am searching for a replacement.
1,Crispy Crunchy,"I'm not sure why I've had such a different experience than many of the other reviewers, but this product left my hair dry and crispy, not good at all. The one I recieved is the newer ""Crulesque"" bottle."
2,"disappointed, just not working for me","Given the number of glowing reviews for this stuff, I can only conclude that I bought it after the formula change, or it's just not for my hair type.I have fine permed hair, and have experimented with varying amounts of this stuff on hair that is in varying stages of wetness. I tried rubbing it in my hands with a bit of water as suggested by another reviewer. No matter what I do, I get zero shine, hold or definition. The additional hope of finding a curl cream with a little conditioning is out the window. Maybe I got a bad batch... this stuff is pasty, leaves some film, and weighed my hair down enough that I actually lost curl. Bummer."
3,"Good, but not great","I have very curly hair, and my stylist recommended this product for me and honestly every single time I use, I like it less. I wanted to love it because it's kind of pricey; but it makes my hair crunchy, and I was looking for more of the smooth silky curls. I have tried using less of the product at once, but it's just not a great product for my taste. It does hold your curls greatly though!"
3,Higher Price for Virtually the Same Product,"I've been using Tigi's Curls Rock (in the aqua blue container) for several years and been very satisfied. When I saw this ""new"" Tigi item, I thought I would give it a try. Thing is, I can't see any difference performance-wise from the original Curls Rock. The only difference is the higher price. I'm sticking with the original."
5,Perfect Product,"I have EXTREMELY curly hair and this is probably the only product I've found that leaves my curls perfect. The product can also be re-boosted if you add water to it after you've been wearing it for hours and it works just like new. I received this 2-pack extremely quickly and in perfect condition, plus it had a great low price."
2,"Leaves your hair looking great--there's one big problem, though.","I bought this product at a hair salon a few months ago. I've really liked the other Curls Rock products I've tried, I figured I give this one a spin.The good thing: it leaves your hair really shiny and extra curly (if you have curly hair already, I imagine). I haven't known anyone with straight hair who's tried this product, so I don't know for sure.The bad thing (and it's a VERY BAD thing): When this products dries in your hair, it starts flaking off and it looks like you have a severe case of dandruff!How do I know this? Well, the times I didn't use this product after washing my hair, the 'dandruff' problem disappears. At first, I thought maybe I was using too much, but now I use a very small amount and I still have the 'dandruff' problem. It gets worse after you comb your hair too.If you want to try this product, go ahead, but my current bottle of 4 oz. Curl Amplifier will definitely be my last."
4,really good stuff!!!,"When my favorite product was discontinued, I picked this up at a garage sale. I have hair that would just be frizzy if I did not use this stuff. And this holds up even in the rainy climate in which I live.Everyone should experiment with the best way to use this product. I have finally learned to put about 3 small pumps on the last layer of my hair - the ends - the most frizzy, right after a short towel drying. Then I wait about 15 minutes and apply a bit more to the rest of my hair. I have to use a lot of this stuff, as my hair is rather long and is colored, which means that those dry, frizzy ends really soak it up.I don't wash my hair every day, but if I spray water on it, the product works as well as it did the day before.The only downside is that I don't have the shine I would like, but I may try an additional TIGI product for that...."
2,Dissappointed in product change,This is stiffer in my hair than the original Curls Rock Amplifier. I'm glad to see the original back in stores.
3,Works to Define Curls but with Drawbacks,"Pro: Defines Curls Con: CrunchesPro: Defrizzes Con: Sometimes dries out hair.Pro: Longlasting hold Con: Smells odd, not bad per say but just slightly off.Con: Sticky.All in all, this is a good product, as it does as it should with defining curls, yet there are definite drawbacks in texture, smell, and initial feel.To be honest, it works, but it comes nowhere near the quality of the old TIGI curls rock."
3,TIGI catwalk curl collection,The directions for its use is not included with the product. My hair stylist recommended it . Once I get a chance to call her I will get the proper instructions. I'd recommend it just get directions for its use.
4,nice product,"Does what it says it will do. Brings out the curls, light hold, doesn't weigh my medium-length hair down. Doesn't affect color or shine except in a positive way. Also, keeps my hair from having a flyaway look. I've purchased this 3 times now and will again."
5,Awesome stuff!,I have very tight natural curls and this stuff really helps with frizzy hair and holds my curls nice all day. Love this stuff!!
2,Go back to the original,"I've been using this product (the original) for 7 years now, sadly I bought this and have become very disappointed. My hair seems to be more frizzy and uncontrollable but the last straw was it makes my hair line break out! Thanks Catwalk but I will be taking my business elsewhere."
2,Higher cost for a fancier package,"I love the original Curls Rock Amplifier that came in the blue pump bottle. Like all curly girls, I've tried hundreds of products and it was my favorite. I was very disappointed when the store where I purchase it from told me that they had discontinued it and that this new product was it's replacement. I've found this new product to be very drying and it doesn't give me the wonderful polished curls that it's predecessor did. This also let my hair feeling very 'gunky' and the alcohol in it caused a lot of dandruff. Overall, I'm very disappointed in this product and TiGi. I guess I'll be buying the old stuff online from now on."
5,Awesome result,"I have curly hair and, like all curly hair, it tends to get a lot of volume as the day goes by. This product keeps my curls under control - like perfect springs - and avoids the annoying ""pom-pom"" hair. :) Bye bye volume! Remember to spread it well on your hands before applying, and using low amounts."
1,crunchy,"I have thick curly hair and this makes my hair super crunchy.The bottle says use 1-2 pumps but that is way too much. I have tried using a smaller amount, but even 1/4 teaspoon of this product gives me helmet head."
5,super,the TIGI catwalk is excelent for curly hair. My daughter have the hair so curly and bloond . This product is super for that kind of hair. I used all the TIGI product for curly hair. They are so awesome.
3,Ok for holding curl,My hair is thick and wavy/curly. This only does an ok job at holding the curl. I had higher hopes since it cost so much but oh well.
5,"Wonderful movie, shame about the quality of the DVD....","I waited many years for this brilliant movie to come out on DVD and must confess that I was rather disappointed in the overall quality of the transfer. It is almost better to watch it on video as at least the pictures seem to be more stable... a great shame, for this is a truly wonderful and touching movie with Montgomery Clift at the height of his talent."
1,Defective DVD,"This DVD was defective. The movie was great, what I got to see of it before it complete stopped. I returned it to the return address over a month ago and have received no responce since then."
4,D Day in Normandy with the United States Navy,"I was looking for research items for the US Navy involvement with the Normandy Invasion, Operation Neptune. A graduate of my high school was killed-in-action on an LCF on the 6th of June and I thought the individual naval stories would have insite.Neptunus Rex is a melting of individual stories of naval personnel who were at the forfront of the naval action on the 6th of June. Although the stories are short in nature...they give a first hand account thru the enlisted and officers eyes as to how they saw the operation go down.Very good research book and very interesting reading.....just wish they would have had more from the individuals on boats that were attacked and sunk, destroyed or managed to get back to England...."
2,Lacking in Explanations and Theory,"This book is ok for what it does. It lists hundreds of different variations for the QGA. That is good information to have and players will benefit from going over it. However, my main complaint is that the book is very lacking in theory, it doesn't give much explanation of why certain moves are made. There's little discussion at all. This book is more or less a huge list of variations with a small amount of discussion thrown in.Also the book is very poorly formatted. It is not spaced or organized well, all the text is smashed together making it a much tougher read. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone but advanced chess players."
4,A good guide,"It was the first time for me in South America, so I didn't know nothing about the birds there. I had the chance to find this guide, which helped me very much, thanks to the good figures. The text is a little bit poor, but for a beginner it's enough. For some families like the Furnariids and the Tyrannids the figures weren't always good for recognising the species in the field. But, in general, I found this guide very useful and the best between all other guides of the region which I saw."
4,birds of S. America and Antatartica,The book gets 4 stars only because the distribution of the birds are bunched up in the backGood illustrations and text.Highly recommend it to anyone planning to bird in S. America
2,Birds of Southern South America,"Despite its rather poor birds drawings and notes, this guide helped me during my trip in Argentina and Chile. However, the maps are not easy to read, as being put at the end of the book.The guide ""birds of Chile of Alvaro Jaramillo"" is , from far, a much better book."
2,Weak,"I don't believe there is a good choice at this time. We are headed to Brazil on a birding trip soon. Of about 720 birds that we might reasonably see in the areas we are to visit according to various compiled trip reports, this book only covered 60%. In addition, the pictures on the facing page from the text, were in almost random order. I used the Clements book on Peru to fill in 3/4 of the missing birds."
4,A good area guide,"This book is a very good guide. The thing I like most about it is its size. It is actaully smaller than ""Birds of North America"". It is a field guide not a desk reference like Howell and Webb ""Birds of Mexico"", that is about 3x larger or Hilty ""Birds of Venezuela"" 4x larger. These two books are actually too large to use as field guides. Many rip out the illustrations and bind them separately, because the books are too big to lug around. The only reason it did not receive 5 stars is because the range maps are in the back of the book. But ""Birds of Costa Rica"" does not even have range maps and it is considered excellent by many."
3,A better guide for Argentina...,"I found this guide to be occasionally inaccurate and lacking much needed info for any serious birding, though it is useful as a backup/reference for other area guides. Instead of this book, I recommend you consider ""Birds of Argentina & Uruguay"" by Tito Narosky and Dario Yzurieta. If not easy to find on Amazon, try Birdlife International, or just pick up a copy in Buenos Aires."
1,Could be a lot better...,"Since there are few complete pocket guides for South America I though that this was worth a chance. However, there are areas for improvement- many of the illustrations are strangely proportioned- heads are too big or too small, bodies elongated or squat, and so forth. The poor use of space on the plates is surprising for a book produced by Princeton. To top in all off the maps are all in the back of the book, meaning that you are constantly flipping back and forth. I ordered this with ""Birds of South America"" by Erize et al., which is of a similar format and also published by Princeton. No problems with that book at all...but too bad I can't recommend this one..."
5,Great starter brush or for the experienced user!,"Having used this brush as one of my main brushes in my shaving ""rotation"", I can tell you to ignore the low price and buy this especially if you use ""hard soaps"" instead of creams. I have used the brush for over 7 years. It is well made and resilient. I can't say enough about Omega products. They are some of the best values in the shaving world"
3,a time of innocence,"I love the Maida series as a time of innocence mostly written before or during WWI. I got Maida's Little Shop on Kindle for free,loved it and bought this one as 2nd in the series. The story was terrific, but the number of errors and typos was horrific. Amazon should be ashamed for charging anything for this."
3,"Good book, poorly scanned","I've always loved the series, but the scanned image was not proofread very well.If you cannot get the original book, then this is better than nothing. It's certainly readable. But the mistakes in the scanned image are distracting."
1,Love the story but this reprint is garbage,"My wife had these books as a child, we love them all and were trying to buy some for our Niece. This reprint however is garbage, it has an incredible number of typos, misprints, format problems. I would not be surprised if the printer used a scanner to reproduce the book but used no spell check. The chapters should be in Roman numerals but the come out with T's instead of I's. Chapter start end are jammed together on the same page. If you are going to reprint try to do a better job."
5,I have wonderful memories of this book.,"The entire ""Maida"" series had special meaning for me as a young girl, as Maida is also my name. It was a difficult name for a young girl to have... who wanted an unusual name as a child? ""Maida"" was a strong and wonderful person to relate to; I cherished each book as it came out. Unfortunately, all my childhood books are gone, but I would love to reacquire them. Please let me know if anyone knows where to get them. THANK YOU."
3,Interesting but Disappointing,"Deutsch is an interesting writer, and his thesis and its defense are superficially convincing. Unfortunately, in at least two cases important to that defense I remember enough about the subject matter (the Turing thesis, and Kuhn's work) to recognize that his interpretation is superficial, and therefore does not provide intended support for his assertions. This makes me wonder whether similar problems underlie the rest of his work. That is really too bad, as the book is readable and could help people to understand many of the important themes in current technology."
2,Not Memorable,"I read this book several years ago and find that I remember almost nothing that I would consider I learned from it directly. Much of the material within has been more capably addressed by folks like Michio kaku, Brian Greene and Lisa Randall. The parallel universes theory has more physical support than some reviewers might think, but the WAY it actually affects our world is up to speculation. I would highly suggest an interested reader go for Lisa Randall'sWarped Passagesinstead."
3,Interesting but slow-going,"I found about a quarter of this book fascinating. But the remaining 75 percent or so was a mighty slow trudge that occasonally was downright headache-inducing. I'd find myself having to re-read some of the more opaquely written paragraphs more than once. I'd suggest tackling a more straightforward work on quantum theory (perhaps ""The Elegant Universe,"" if you have any interest in string theory) before wading into this one."
1,Skip it,"Long winded and verbose, the author doesn't justify any of his statements. He jumps into multiverse (multiple universes) and expects you to accept it, without any justification or acknowledge of alternative theories or explanations. Hawking's Theory of Everything was much better.I'm tossing it in the trash, it's not worth the bookshelf space."
5,"Deep, clever and mindboggling","This is a fantastic book, you should not miss it if you are curious about what this reality is made of. David Deutsch has a real talent."
1,Whoops!,"Sorry, I meant ""what the phrase 'this universe' may mean in the SECOND case, in the case in which (supposedly) zillions of universes are each continually fragmenting into zillions of other universes, is another question."" In the first case, the case in which there is only one universe, the phrase ""this universe"" clearly means ""THE universe""."
2,"Good physicist, bad writter","I was hoping for something that related the discussed the implications of quantum mechanics on our on view of reality. IMO, the book was lacking.I found the writing style painful to read. As other reviewers have said, the author should have used a ghost writer.The author spends too much time pumping 'virtual reality' and too little time on quantum mechanics.The chapter on epistemology was interesting.. so perhaps the one positive take away is a new interest in the work of Karl Popper."
2,It has no content.,"I must give Deutsche the credit he deserves. He's a good writer, and clearly a very bright physicist. But I didn't like this book. It's good in that it brings up certain issues to make you think of them, but don't passively accept everything he says. He can be quite seductive. Any good examination of his claims will reveal them for what they are. For example, Deutsche certainly did not solve the problem of induction, despite his claims. His dismissal of instrumentalism also disgusted me. It just seems that the whole view is just based on his boyhood fantasy, which he relates as the book opens. So, read his book by all means, but don't think this is THE BOOK with THE ANSWERS."
1,A mediocre presentation of theoretical physics.,"I've read many books on theoretical physics (quantum theory, parallel universes, etc.) and I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. The concepts discussed have been discussed before. Chapter 7: A Conversation About Justification was absolutely mind boggling. If you really want to learn about theoretical physics, then read Feynman or Hawking."
2,Too Dense,"In the end I didn't care for this book. It was just too dense at times. It seemed as much a treatise on his philosophical arguments and the ""four quantum threads"" he binds together. I think that this books needs an 'interested layman's edition' with many more graphics, much the same way Richard Dawkins did with the Magic of Reality."
1,A legend in his own membrane,"Life is far too short to waste on this excruciatingly pompous, self-congratulatory and tedious (supposed) account of the theory of everything. If you ever decide self-flagellation is absolutely unavoidable this is just the thing for you! I ran screaming, pretty damn quickly, back to the sanctuary of Roger Penrose!"
1,bunch of nonsense,"This book is built of figments that cannot be verified experimentally because of their very definition (Many Worlds) or have failed experimental verification (darwinism, etc.), nor on other grounds. Most of the book revolves around the Many Worlds, an idea that is by definition non-sense (see among other Jonathan Harrison's paper ""The Impossibility of 'Possible Worlds'"" in Philosophy v. 74, n. 287 (Jan. 1999.) I could write a lot to debunk the numerous absurdities contained in this book, but it does not deserve receiving more scientific consideration than Alice in the Wonderland."
5,"Important Book, but Author Needs to Take LSD ASAP!","This is a great example of the cognitive dissonance going on in physics these days. Theories so bizarre, as to make Black Holes seem commonplace, yet with NO supposed implications for Newtonian mechanistic meaningless worldviews. When Einstein said 'Relativity Changed Everything Except How We Think', one could imagine Einstein included himself in that criticism merely out of politeness, yet with Deutsch it seems actually true. Though, I still have hope that Deutsch will break his rigid academic strait-jacket, perhaps after the Nobel, and perhaps via some vibes from colleague Brian Josephson, and get a little into the 'what does it all mean' vein ... like whoever said: ""Sahasarara Popping Transcendence"", hehehe. (for an antidote science book, check out Nobelis Kary Mullis' 'Dancing Naked in the Mind Field')"
2,"In your guts, you know he's nuts - L.B.J.","His advocacy of Popperism in the early part of the book is so convincing that when he came to the point, I couldn't tell if he was serious or not. Apparently he is, but he failed to convince me that he believes it himself."
1,Impenetrable,"Probably the mostly awkwardly worded, dense book I have ever read. There was a summary at the end of each chapter, but they didn't help my understanding. The author demonstrated that he was a committed Darwinist with the sentence on p169, ""Charles Darwin's theory of evolution explained the origin of life in terms that required no special physics ..."" Of course, Darwin's theory does not explain the origin of life at all, other than attributing its creation to ""the Creator"", so I'm not sure what point Deutsch is trying to make.There is a diagram on p112 of a person lying next to a computer with a lead going from the person's head to the computer, together with explanation of how signals go from brain to computer and vice versa. Virtual reality has something to do with the so-called fabric of reality. That is about the only concept that I gathered from this book."
2,Misread and Misled,"An interpretation of science is not science and should not be presented as such. I read this book and wasn't persuaded otherwise, thus I was displeased."
1,"pompous, pretentious, boring","I am deeply disappointed by David Deutsch's The Fabric of Reality . That book seems to me pompous, pretentious and worse of all extremely boring to read. A real ""intellectual imposture "". His ideas might be funny to consider but his aggressive statement of them as an absolute and evident truth is unbearable. ""Believe ye suckers!"" he seems to proclaim to his hapless readers. As much as I liked Smolin'sThe Life of the Cosmos I disliked Deutsch's book."
2,What would Occam do?,"Two observations: Most physicists do not accept Deutch's conclusions concerning quantum reality. The mutliple worlds interpretation was created because some physicists were uncomfortable with the philosophical interpretations of the Copenhagen interpretation. That the observer might have a role in determining the final state of a quantum system is disconcerting...but the many worlds interpretation as originally proposed does not solve the problem. Deutch's version does solve that problem, but it requires us to assume an infinitely large number of parallel universes--in order to preserve the duality between observer and observed, and locality. But which is more parsimonious--to accept Bohr's conclusions, or assume an infinite number of parallel worlds?Second...Deutch is intellectually dishonest. He tries to prove his point by assuming his conclusion--a logical fallacy.This is an interesting, but flawed, book."
4,Impressions from a non expert,"This review, which combines advances in four sciences of great interest to those with lay knowledge of them, still seems the most thorough and knowledgeable attempt to explain reality. The treatments of quantum physics and computation were the most interesting to me."
2,pretty much unreadable,"The ideas are great but the writing style is convoluted, making large swathes unreadable. David Deutsch would have benefited from a determined editor who might have limited his stream of consciousness style of writing and put a better structure to the book. I came away bored and irritated, rather than inspired, as I had hoped."
1,Didn't do much,"I was hoping that this will help me shape a ceramic tile after it has been snipped, but it didn't. In fact it wouldn't make a dent in the tile. I am not sure what the manufacturer meant by cutter, but this thing doesn't cut/sand down anything."
1,Worthless!!!,"Not even worth this inexpensive price the liquid was ""frozen"" in place no matter what I did to it I could not get it to move just a complete waste of money and resources."
1,does not work,"The one I bought is a whole degree off. On the package it has environmentally friendly, mercury-free, no where does it mention the accuracy, good reason, it's junk."
1,Doesn't work,"I purchased this thermometer at the recommendation of my naturopath. It is awkward to keep in your mouth because the portion you place in your mouth is quite short. Also, the rather wide body of the thermometer makes it difficult to get the thermometer far enough under the tongue to get a good reading. I used the thermometer several times and couldn't get the substance in the thermometer to budge, no matter how much I shook it. It also takes forever. 4 minutes seems like an eternity when you have to use a hand to keep the thermometer in your mouth. I get a much better and faster reading on a digital thermometer I got for free from my PCP. Don't waste your money."
5,John Wayne's Tribute to America,Never saw this when it first came out but enjoyed it now. They don't do shows like this anymore. True Americana and very patriotic. Most actors in this video I think are deceased so it's cool to see them together in one program. Love the nostalgic NBC Peacock to start the program. The Budweiser commercials are a hoot.
4,John Wayne,I have always loved watch the Duke there are many different things that can happen if you try or are willing to give it your all.
3,John Wayne MC,This wasn't quite what I had expected. John Wayne was mainly the MC of a variety program. Wish there had been more of him.
3,john wayne,"I got this for my husband who is a big fan of john wayne. He said it was ok , but the shipping was great and it got here when it was suppose to be here."
2,"Fun, but so cheesy!","I bought this after remembering watching it when I was a kid....well, it was definately made when it was...so silly! However, I love John Wayne, so it is just another thing to add to my collection!"
1,Did you even watch the movie???,"All I can think is that anyone can write crap and it'll be published. Did the author really even watch the movie?Benigni plays a Jew that gives up his life to save his son... He's IN the concentration camp, so where is the denial??? He dies because he's a Jew. He loses his wife, his uncle and his life.The Author (and the 5 star reviewers) need to get a clue (and a life). There's enough Real anti-semitism in the world (that is the fact of history) without a need to create it in criticism of a film that's only purpose is to glorify a JEWISH father giving his life to save his son from the facist Nazis."
2,for kids,"I wasn't aware of what this set really was. It is probably good for kids, but not beyond. Rather boring"
1,Not for adults,"I had the opportunity to work with Jim Varny shortly before his untimely passing. When I saw this video I remembered vaguely, that it was a TV program. What I didn't remember was that it is purely for little kids. I haven't been one of those for a very long time. It's a pretty silly program, but I'm sure kids got a kick out of it."
1,To stupid for an adult to watch - as usual Earnest and Bobby are funny but the rest of the cast are really dumb and not at all f,DUMB dumb dumb dumb dumb moronish don't buy only for kids earnest and booby are funny but that's all - booby booby booby is funny - he'd be funnier though if he had boobs.
5,"Hey Kids! Did you hear that?, Boy I sure did!!","As a child of the 80s/90s, I enjoyed Jim Varney in the role of Ernest P Worrell. I have fond memories of watching this on Saturday morning. As of recent, I was still quoting skits from this show, and that's how I came across the series on DVD.Very unforgettable characters, like Lonnie Don, Earl the Barber, ""Brother Bobby"", and lots more!It's as funny as I remember, and as an adult, I still get tons of laughs, and enjoy it so much.Even if you aren't familiar with the show, I high recommend you check it out. At this price, you just can't go wrong!!!!"
2,I love Ernest movies but not this show.,"This show is bad! Jim Varney is great. Ernest is great in movies but this show is boring. It breaks into constant skits that are very repetitive with each episode. However, it is very inexpensive so if you love Ernest like I do, give it a shot."
2,The Hunger,I didn't find this book to be memorable. The book lacks passion in my opinion. I would not get any more books by this author.
1,Can I say BORING!,I love vamp & were romances but this was so boring. I couldn't even make myself finish it ~ unlikable characters & a story that was so slow-moving. Considering the reviews I expected it to be pretty good ~ what a disappointment.
2,Works well while they last,"This product is an excellent idea ruined by poor materials. I bought two of these in June 2011. On one, the zipper has separated from the bag material. On the other, the zipper won't zip anymore. I did not over stuff the bags.I wish these were made better as they were quite wonderful while they lasted. I had the 5 reel model. Transporting rod/reel combos was a breeze. I loved that I had the choice to leave them together (up to 8') or break them down and still leave the reel on (with the handle broken down).Some better quality zippers and assembly would have made this a present I gave to all my fishing buddys. Unfortunately, I have to advise you to go with a better made product."
3,Inspect the set carefully for quality issues,"These dish sets have quality issues. I ordered 3 sets (12 place settings) and needed to call World Kitchen for 2-3 replacement dishes per set. World Kitchen was courteous and said I'd have new, free dishes within 10 days. The flaws included smeared blue glaze, other glaze problems, and a dent in one bowl.All the bowls had little pinpricks on the bottom, probably where the glass was poured for molding. Most of the blue stripes were a little uneven at the point where they must have started and stopped. I decided to ignore those two flaws.If you like Corelle's light, thin, and damage-resistant dishes, this is a pretty set. We're keeping ours. Just inspect your set carefully when you first receive it."
1,Me Likey!! (or so I thought),"Exactly what I wanted, stacks nicely, light weight, good size, sturdy, looks nice. The only thing I don't like is the plates are very thin, so the bottom gets very hot to the touch when you put piping hot food on it. For people who don't eat sitting at the table, it might be an issue.Update-I change my mind. I have very few of these dishes left. They are very easy to break if you have children. And when they do break, they EXPLODE! Pieces of the dishes go flying everywhere. Tiny little shards of razor sharp shrapnel. I was cut by the flying pieces, and I wasn't even near where it broke! I won't buy this brand again. :("
4,Small bowls,"This is a very nice set, but if you are a big cereal eater, the bowls are kind of small. Overall, the set is durable, lightweight, and does the job."
2,Cheap stuff. You get what you pay for.,"Thin, cheap stuff. Not worth it. Good for camping/motorhome gear.Spend a little more money and get a better quality set of dishes."
2,Not pleased,"I loved the speed in which the Corelle Livingware arrived and was very excited to receive the packages but I was very disappointed that after going through the trouble of unpacking them, washing them and placing the plates in the cupboard I discovered that three were very warped. I loved the set I had owned for 20 years but I have discovered that the quality has decreased exponentially. What ever happened to pride in workmanship?"
5,Corelle Dinnerware,I love Corelle dinnerware ... dishwasher and microwave safe ... Shop around and don't be persuaded by design. Go for price (like I did) and you will be very satisfied. Your friends will admiire your good taste.
4,Good Lightweight Plate,"I really like these dishes. They're thin and lightweight. I can get a lot more dishes in my dishwasher since they are thinner than my old dishes. Don't expect the design to be perfect because very few of mine are. Some of the lines don't quite match up, and there are some slight bulges along the lines. These flaws are barely noticeable so they don't bother me. I wish the small plates were about 2 inches larger in diameter. 6-3/4 inches is kind of small for a plate. The bowls are plenty big for me."
5,Just like the old Corelle you remember,I'm still using a few pieces of 30+ year old Corelle handed down from my grandmother. This is just like those classics except the stoneware cups but they seem fine as well (just wish they were made in USA.) I did not have any issues with the stripes or finish as mentioned by at least one reviewer and I ordered 2 sets.
5,Amazing,These plates are a great value. I was pleasantly surprised with how nice these plates are. The coffee mugs are superb.
4,Corelle Livingware,Pros: I was surprised when I ordered on line and got the shipment two days later! The shipping was free so I had prepared myself to wait. It was packaged tightly with no breakage. The pattern is beautiful with few flaws in the paint as others indicated. It stacks very nicely in my dishwasher(so much better than my old stoneware). They are lightweight and stack in my cupboards with ease (except a little warped-see cons).Cons: Why a 4 instead of a 5 star. The bowls could be bigger for cereal but we use big mugs for our soup so not an issue when we do soup. The plates are a little warped and so don't stack evenly in the cupboard. I plan to contact the company tonight for a few replacements. I may come back to change my rating depending on how the exchange goes.
1,poor purchase and product,"poor quality product.line in blue irregular and not quality. Came as dirty like already used. had to return,ordered a different one"
4,Dishes,"Very attractive, dishwasher and microwave proof. I think they should leave off the cups and cut the price. Who doesn't have cups cluttering up the cabinet already?"
3,Plates and bowls a little on the thin side.,The plates and bowls are thinner than I had expected. I can make out my hand through the plate if I hold it up to the light. Well see how long they last. They are good sizes and should fit the bill. The mugs are fine and seem like the should hold up. The plates are made in USA and the mugs are made in China.
4,"Dishes good, cups not so much!","I've used this brand for nearly 40 years now.This is a good set except for the cups. The cups are cheap, made in China junk and are NOT made from the same material as the other items in the set.Recommended with the understanding that the cups are inferior."
4,The China is excellent,"I got a set of Corelle when I had to rebuild my kitchen. The stuff is awesome.It's light weight, wicked durable, cleans well in the dish washer or by hand. The kids have dropped plates and they haven't broken.The mugs are pretty much worthless. I wish that there was a pack of the Cafe Blue without the mugs. I threw the mugs away.I also wish one could buy the Classic Cafe Blue style in other items (e.g., pasta bowls.)So, I'd give a 5 star if the set didn't include the mugs."
4,Great starter set,I have ordered three sets of Corelle recently for my nephew and two step children as they have each gotten their first apartment. These dishes were a hit in all three instances.
2,1 mug was totally smashed -- not packed at all well,I couldn't find any way to just get a replacement mug and it was too much of a hassle to return everything for 1 mug
3,CORELLE DISH SET,"THIS IS A VERY NICE SET OF DISHES..AS CORELLE HAS ONLY BEEN FOR YEARS AND YEARS...BUT, BE CAREFUL..THE COFFEE CUPS ARE NOT MADE WITH THE SAME MATERIAL AS THE CORELLE DISHES AND THE FIRST DAY A CUP DROPPED AND BROKE.THIS IS VERY SAD SINCE MY NEW SERVICE FOR FOUR..IS NOW FOR THREE."
3,Few flaws,These arrived in great shape and quicker than my order indicated. Love the pattern - very fun and very bright. They would have received a full five stars except for a few design flaws. I may have to find a couple of replacement plates - not happy about that.
4,They are ok,These will work in a pinch but they are super thin. They will be great for my lake house someday. Try a discount store first to see if you can get something a little more substantial. But I don't regret buying these.
2,so poor quality,I bought the plates as additions for when we had a lot of company over for dinner. They chip very easily on the corners. I do not wash them in he dishwasher I simply wash by hand and almost all of them have chips on the corners. I do not recommend buying these.
3,Corelle,"Actally we had look on many of the corelle plates and we bought this. But when i saw it directly it looks totally different.Another thing when i recv it I got one plate broken :(... But i havnt changed it, As it is expensive than buying a new one.Otherwise its ok.... When ur price concern this could be the choice."
1,Dangerous dishes Beware !,"Google""Corelle is dangerous"" and read all about it.It breaks and when it breaks, it shatters.If you likecleaning up hundreds of small sharp pieces of glass this is for you.As for me, I am throwing out all the Corelle I bought!When a bowl broke yesterday I was lucky I wasn't hurt.others haven't been so lucky.Beware of Corelle!"
5,Awsome!!!!!!,This gun is so awsome. It shoots awsomley acurate and far. The clip is cool and it loads completly into the gun. The only problem is that on my gun you have to push the clip in a littttlle bit further so it is fully in there and it will cock. but it isnt hard to do at all.The acuracy is great but you have to adjust the hop up a little bit. It is on the left side of the barrel about halfway down. On mine one end of the hop up aduster thing is on the 3rd big notch and the ohter end is on the 4th big notch. This is on the end away from you. Just keep adjusting it untill you find the right place. Now one of my first questions was is it good with .12 bbs? Yes it is awsome wiht them. it is more acurate with the .20 but they are slower. And they arent that more acurate. So if you are worried that it wont be good with .12 then dont be casue it is great. All together this gun is awsome!!!!!!!!
4,Shank not included,"Although the picture displayed at the time of this writing clearly shows the shank, it is not included in the packaging. Pictures of similar hitches (same brand, different model) on Amazon show the not-included parts grayed or ghosted out. The picture from the manufacturer's site shows the components all taken apart and the shank is not included."
3,A decent flick.,"It was closer to the feel of the novel than the Omega Man. I think today's multi-tasking, ADD audience will be fidgeting in their seats because of the slow pace. Let's see how Will Smith will do in the upcoming remake."
4,I Am Legend,"Great movie and picture quality good. ""Last Man on Earth"" and ""Omega Man"" are in the same genre as ""I Am Legend"" in theaters today. A must see for apocalypse movie fans."
4,Low PRICE. I AM LEGEND,I bought this for a dollar at a local grocery store. I figured for a dollar it would be worth watching. To my surprise it was pretty decent. Vincent plays the last man role a little wimpier than Heston did in the Omega Man.
5,am i legend?,"this movie is in it's third time around; first, there was this film with vincent price next, there was the film 'the omega man' with charlton heston now, there is the film 'i am legend' with will smith. both of the first two films are quite good (i have not seen the third version so no comment at this time on that film.) i first saw the first version of this film in 1970; it gave me one good scare! many people say this is a ""b"" movie; i disagree! i would compare it to the ""art"" film 'dr. strangelove; both films deal with the same basic question: is our speices dumb enough to bring about our own extinction? vincent price is one of the greatest actors that america ever produce and, is magnificent in the role as robert morgan (the last man on earth.) he is a national treasure."
4,Where is the film story set in?,"Is it supposed to be a city in the USA? Judging by the governor on tv speech Morgan watches I guess so. It of course was filmed in (the most modern sections of) Rome, Italy. The story makes sense enough. As to why Morgan doesn't live in a high rise (as another poster asked) well the vampires are all over the city at night. he wouldn't be much safer there."
2,Abridged,"It is so hard to find unabridged copies of George MacDonald's work. This one is hacked to bits. If you want an abridged copy, it is fine. Nice illustrations and such... but the rich descriptions and nuances that make MacDonald's work so wonderful, in my eyes, are missing from this title."
5,A Wonderful Book,This book is one few that are able to reach out to the reader and grab your attention. I hope to pass this book on to my daughter someday.
3,"The Color is not True, the lighting",The picture looks more white around the border and the middle with grapes and wine creamish. The whole lighting is off and color is not truly represented in picture. The whole thing is like creamish in color and depending on where clock is placed and how the light hits it you may not see the time. you have to lean your head or position it in such a way to see the time.
4,Quick fix,"Did the repair myself, a quick fix and still going strong after 6 months. Good stuff. Need to get some more tools though, attacked the problem with not much kungfu skills..."
3,"It was good, but....","Was not as good as her other books. Ms. Phillips really showed her writing talents in ""The Bachelor"", ""The Playboy"", and ""The Heartbreaker"", but this book left something to be desired. There were times when I wanted to put it down and move on to reading something else, but I held out til the end. I like Ms. Phillips books and will continue to buy them, and I can't wait to read her next release."
1,Awful,This book could have been 100 pages. All Phillips did was reiterate the same psycho bullcrap over and over. I would give it a negative rating if I could.
2,Boring,"When I finished with this book (and that was a struggle), I kept trying to analyze why it was so tedious. The crazy family part of the book was mildly interesting, but the main characters are simply too nice to be believable. There's not a fault in any of them -- other than a little emotional backwardness -- so there's really no dramatic tension at all, although there's plenty of sophomoric psychology 101, which was way, way overdone. Personally, I like characters with a little bit of an edge to their personalities to keep a book interesting. When you couple unintriguing characters with a very thin plot, you have a deadly dull read."
4,Fast read,"I just finished the book at lunch. I have now read everything written by Carly Phillips. I think she's great. The way that Quinn put Ari feelings about her sister first were heart warming. The electricity that was between these two characters was great. Spank the monkey, I could just see in my head the way she acted when Zoe came home. Too funny."
2,Not Much There,"Even as light romantic fiction goes this book just doesn't have a lot of juice. The characters are unrealistic and the story line just doesn't work. The author tried to tell too many stories at the same time and didn't satisfy the reader with any of them. I have read this author's previous novels and found them to be exactly what I expected. Light, by-the-pool reading. But this book just didn't gel with me. Unfortunately the story line was boring and extremely predictable, the characters completely unbelievable and the solutions to conflict too easy. I just couldn't buy this one. I like a little mind candy occasionally but this book didn't satisfy my sweet tooth at all."
3,"Undercover Cops, Eccentric Family and a Casino",`Under the Boardwalk' is a light romance suspense novel. Ariana moves back home when her twin sister goes missing and ends up entwined with a handsome undercover cop. Ariana's eccentric Greek family steals the show with a mix of `A Greek Wedding and the Adam's Family. I am off to find more of Carly Phillips books. I would also suggest Kate Angell's book such as `Crazy for you'.
5,Claudine Fans and Soft Jaz Lovers,"I have owned this recording since it was released.It is the best work she has released. The blending of her unique voice, musical arrangements and clearity of the recording makes this a must have.Claudine was performing 'soft jazz' before there was a name for this type of musical genru.Her presentation of Dovonan's 'Catch the Wind' is better than the original.Claudine's 'country sound' of Colours is pure pleasure for country and non-country fans alike.My only regret is that I do not have this CD.I have vinyl and 4-track tape and they are wearing out.Please restock this item."
3,1st Season???,The 1st Season of ThirtySomething (a Great TV show) had 21 episodes. And we're only releasing 10 of those original 21 episodes because...why?
4,Exceeded Expectations!!,"I must admit, when hearing that a second cd was going to be released I was afraid that it would not sound as rich and soulful as the first. As time passed and the 2nd cd never dropped, I was beginning to feel doubt that it would even happen. To my suprise, the cd has arrived with a destiny to leave it's mark on our souls and minds.They have songs that make you think like No Place, Save my Baby and Blackmail, songs that make you groove like Let 'Em Know, I'm Grown, and songs that make your soul smile like Slow Motion, and Grandma's Grove. This cd is worth buying. I look forward to future releases, hopefully that will showcase your true vocal talents. Good Luck!!"
1,Whats going on here?,"First, I was really looking forward to this album. I do understand that people have different tastes but ""a must have"", and ""slammin"" and ""what music has been missing"". I think I found all of the fans that think that American Idol is soulful. This is either a really distasteful joke or its the mothers of the artists leaving comments. Im not trying to rip anyone apart but this album bears ""NOT ONE"" resemblance of the creativity, the production, and vocals that this group once carried. Ok...so Its different. No big deal. But Im just trying to figure out what these people are listening to. All and all, dont take my word for it. And dont take theirs. Buy it for yourself and Im sure it will become clear on whether this is the last Christion album you buy."
1,This one,Is not Ghetto Cyrano by any means! Allen Anthony needs to come back (not as a guest) Just not as good in my opinion.
2,Too short,Too short for my son to use at school. Arrived on time good condition but useless to him to use with school band
4,Vic Firth Kalani Rubber Mallet,"First time ordering a mallet. If you order online, keep in mind that they only come in quantities of one.There might be a picture of two of them, so if you want two mallets, you have to order 2 quantities.I love what they do, but they are just a little too short. I'll have to walk into the drum store andpick them up get a feel for them. Lesson learned."
5,Great road trip music,"Music that you can just enjoy, especially when riding down a ribbon of road. I ususally don't like having music in the outdoors, but I must say, it is really great to listen to when riding down an easy river."
4,Great syncopation and unique sound,"This album offers some very unique rhythmic variations with japanese instruments and sounds. I bought it because the online samples sounded interesting and different from what is normally heard in USA radio and music guides. I was not disappointed for this is a a very unique sound that is refreshing to my ear. ON the faster songs I would say these guy ""Rock"". I plan on getting some of their other volumes."
5,East Meets West,"The Yoshida Brothers have brought something new to the world of music.While the best known song on this CD is the theme for the illusive ""WII"" gaming system TV commercial, each and every song is a wonderful blend of traditional Japanese shamisan with a modern beat.If you are a fan of Japanese music, this is a nice addition to your collection."
3,"Cute idea, but needs refinement . . .","We just bought this doll for our 35 month old daughter. The facial movements on the doll are darling, and my daughter does carry her ""baby"" around with her everywhere. However, this doll is supposed to go to sleep on your shoulder - ours doesn't do that. The mechanics which make the facial and arm movements are VERY loud - it is difficult to hear the baby sounds over the motor. The other thing that bothers me, and is perhaps a bit OCD is that the baby's neck is freakishly long. Her outfit doesn't cover her creepy little neck. Some of the facial movements make her look a bit like Yoda too . . . overall, my daughter does love this but it needs improvement in my opinion."
4,Christmastique!,"Allow me to quote from the Liner Notes-""Marrying the majesty and soaring power of Christmas melodies with the mythic sweep of music for the cinema...these lush creations for full orchestra quite intentionally embody the bold, dramatic spirit that film music captures so elegantly."" This CD is a feast for the ears; prepare yourself for an aural adventure!"
5,About Time!!,"It's about time an investor has finally written truthful book about Day Trading. Jake's book has great insight to new and old traders a like, he tells you like it is, no ""candy coating"" or ""Fluff"". If you are looking to get a solid understanding about Day Trading Commodities then this is the book you must have. NO if or Buts, your financial growth depends on it.Schaaf Kirkpatrick"
5,Essential reading for the Day Trader.,"This book is invaluable to the trader, whether new or established. Some fascinating ideas which I am working on now. I look forward to the new book with eager anticipation."
1,Filler Galore But Not Much More,"I feel that Day Tader II is really a rip-off as it basically just reguritates most of the material found in volume one. THIS is typical Bernstein -- the goal is dollars from book sales, not educating the reader. Mr. Bernstein does not respect his readers, and this is the sad part because he obviously is a highly intelligent man who probably could contribute a lot to the field of daytrading education if he weren't so needy and greedy. I wouldn't go so far as to call him ""Jake the Snake"", but I do think he should put more care into the content of his books."
1,The Worst Author - Ever,"Save your money. Never, never waste your funds on the drivel this author produces!!A profitable trader would never have time enough to write even one tenth the quantity of words this person produces.Find traders that actually make money to learn from. There are a few that have written good books.As starting points:For equities traders try: Professional Stock TradingFor futures traders try: Trading Day by DayThese are simply starting points, but are written by REAL traders, not worthless-book producers."
1,A misleading title,"If you want a book on philosophy, this is for you. If you are looking for a complete guide to daytrading, you will find this book to be mostly padding. Detail useful to a daytrader forms a surprisingly tiny percentage.Its title is the most misleading I have purchased in some years. I want my money back."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"In his book, Jake spells out specific strategies for the day trading approach. He cuts through the BS concerning various indicators and gives his unbiased opinion stressing simplicity. I couldn't put this one down 'til I finished it. A must read for someone wanting to trade the right way!"
1,a terrible book,Reading this book is purely a watse of your time. Buying it is absolutely waste of your money.The only thing you can learn from it is that the author probably makes more money by selling hot topic books than from trading.
1,Nice Try Jake!,"If you have purchased his first book, there is no need to add this one to your library. The systems he writes about are included in his first book with some minor changes and the psychological aspects of trading it seems are copied word for word from the first publication."
3,Another $30 or so down the drain.,"This book is marginal. I think you would get more out of a good technical analysist site on the web (free). You will be dissapointed if you want specific methods to enter and exit trades, I was. A good primer mabye but definatly not a tradable system in this book. Mabye he will put out a complete daytrader 3 to tye everything together? But I probably won't buy it."
2,light survey material,"This was the very first book I bought on daytrading. It is light reading for the completely uninformed. I agree with the repetitive opinion about the vague stock chart and indicator techniques. Too general is too dangerous when you start to do real trades. There are many other books on amazon that cover precise techniques better than this book. If you buy the book anyway after reading this, then at least buy many others before you trade..."
3,"The two volumes should have been a single, shorter volume","This is an improvement over ""The Compleat Day Trader; Vol. I"" in terms of practical applications but way too much is a rehash of statements made in the first volume - some of this appears to be ""padding"" to make the book thick enough to sell as a separate volume. These books would be a good deal if they were condensed into one volume and sold at the price of a single book."
1,scamming,Mr. bernstein is just a pure businessman without regards to his fellow trader.If you visit his website you can't see anything that is not for sale.his methods in his first book is very elementary.I hope he will share his ideas someday without thinking the dollars.
2,Where is the DAY TRADING,This book is more on the aspect of futures trading than stocks. If you do futures trading it is a good book. But if you want a book about trading stocks don't buy. The title is misleading. The charts are good but it does not use stocks to explain his concepts. For stock buyers I do not recommend.
1,UNHAPPY WITH WINDCHIME,When the bamboo windchimes came they were in a very large box wrapped badly with some bubble wrap. They looked as they were used as the chimes had many abrasions on the finish. They were returned.
4,nice tone,These wind chimes have a really nice sound to them when the wind catches them. They move easily in the wind and I would recommend them.
3,Missing a Nut,"Product was up to standards and fit. Hard to screw up, really. However, mine was missing one of the two nuts. Probably a freak occurrence- just grabbed a fitter from a pile in the shop, but could have been a major inconvenience."
5,The Ultimate Cobra Soundtrack,This is the ultimate Cobra soundtrack and is a MUST HAVE for any Anime or Cobra fan in the world!
3,This could have been so much better.,"I was totally appreciative of the concept of this book. Ms. Miller has the right idea, but somehow I found the book to fall very short. There is a definite need for a companion to the I Ching as it is a difficult oracle as is. To that end, I commend Ms. Miller on taking the first step.Ms. Miller could have gone further with this book. Explaining more in depth on how to interprete the hexagrams and nucler hexagrams. How to sufficiently work a full interpretation, et al. Her concordance is most useful, particulalry if you use a true translation like Wilhelm. If you rely on commentaries, this will do you very little good. Further, while Ms. Miller bases her work on the Wilhelm version, any other true translation will apply (like Alfred Huang's).In all fairness, Ms. Miller tells her readers the true intent of the book and that it is not meant to be a lengthy examination of the I Ching. I can appreciate that, but for my money this book could have been so much better."
1,Not what I ordered,"I have been using DGP for several years for my dog who is in severe pain because of a congenital abnormality in her hind leg. It helps her immensely. The stuff that this company is now calling DGP (ImmPower) isn't DGP, and has nothing to do with DGP, or dogs, or pain. It is a bunch of mushrooms for people. The bottle isn't even what is shown in the picture (which is the real DGP bottle).I ordered some DGP for my dog, and was sent the stuff they are trying to palm off as DGP. Now I must locate another seller and order...in the meantime, I have just run out of DGP and my dog will have nothing to help her until another order can be delivered. Please, if you are trying to get DGP, this company is no longer selling it...but something they are calling AMERICAN BIOSCIENCES (IMMPOWER) DGP. No DGP, not for dogs, not in the bottle that is shown. I'm completely disgusted with their false advertising, and terribly upset for my dog."
2,No noticable improvement,"Unfortunately, I did not notice any improvement at all after I gave this product to my arthritic dog. I tried it for several months and found that it did not offer any benefit. In fact, she seemed to improve when I took her off of this product. I'm very disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone.I wonder of many of the positive reviews are written by the company..."
2,Didn't Do Anything,"This product didn't do anything for our dog. He's an 8 year old, x-tra large breed dog with hip and joint issues. DGP didn't seem to help with either his pain or mobility. I don't think it did any harm, but I didn't see any improvement."
2,Very Little Change,"Our dear dog was on Zubrin and we talked to a friend who suggested switching him to DGP. We had high hopes, but after a month of using DGP, we are going back to good ol' science and putting him back on Zubrin. We saw no improvement and I am afraid it might have caused him a little more pain."
5,My dog is doiung great with these things,The DGP has really helps my older dog with her mobility issues. She hardly limps at all now. Thanks!
5,Great stuff,This is the best product I've found for my 3-year-old arthritic Dobie. He can run again and before this he could barely get up. Just great stuff. Wish it were more affordable though. He goes through 2 bottles a month.
5,Helps Phoebe every day,DGP provides a homeopathic remedy that helps our Corgie where expensive treatments and medications failed to cure an unexplainable limp.
3,Careful of these testimonials,Be careful of these testimonial reviews. Many of them could be written by agents of the company itself. This is very common.
3,DGP helps canine arthritis in a subtle way,"Doggone Pain, or DGP, is a supplement for pets which helps with arthritis and other types of pain. I hide the meds in Pill Pockets and other treats, and so far, my 13 year-old Sheltie and 10 year-old Husky mix seem to be doing quite well with this supplement, and they are prancing around like six or seven year-olds. This may be best taken with other supplements and medications, such as glucosamine-chondroiton and Metacam, but it certainly seems to work for the beginning stages of arthritis."
2,Not the miracle I hoped for.,"I have a sheltie with osteoarthritis in one elbow that severely limits his activities. I carry him around a lot, use a pet stroller, etc. and so far have only found a combination of Synovi G3 and Rimadyl to be effective in treating it. The glowing reviews for DGP gave me hope that we could get him off the Rimadyl which of course is not ideal for long-term treatment. I gave this product a good month-long trial but unfortunately it just didn't work for my dog, and after he had clearly gotten worse on it, I had to switch back to the Rimadyl. Still, while it didn't work for me, I still would recommend people try it, the price is a tad high, and it would be nice if they gave some kind of guarantee on it, but if there is even a chance that it might work for your dog versus using NSAIDS, it's worth a shot. I just wish it had worked for us, but I just didn't see any improvement with it at all."
2,No Positive Effects,Tried this for six weeks for my arthritic dog. Product claims to reduce inflammation and ease joint pain. My dog showed no effects of any improvement.
5,DGP works!,Have been using DGP for years and my 18 year old arthritic dog is still perking along. Great stuff! It actually works and I recommend it highly. Also Amazon has a great price!
1,Glucosamine seems to work better than DGP,"We have an old Border Collie who is experiencing arthritis in his foot joints both front and rear. We found that a single aspirin would give him some relief. When I read the glowing reviews of ""Dog Pain Pain"" I thought ""at last, something that really works!"". When it arrived I gave him the recommended three tablets a day. The next several mornings he was hurting far worse!!!! I even bumped it up four tablets a day (two at each meal) and still the same morning pain for the old guy.I decided to try glucosamine after a week of trying DGP and the very next morning he was back to his happy self. Glucosamine is very inexpensive compared to DGP and seems to give the results that compare to some of the positive reviews of DGP.While I'm glad it works for some, in our case DGP was a waste of money."
3,Worked for one/not the other,"DGP has worked really well with my 9 year old female, overweight dog. But not at all with my 5 year old golden. Millie, female, is bouncing and running although she still limps a bit, she seems to feel much better. Jake, my 5 year old male didn't do well at all and we are back to Vetprofen for him."
4,Big help from Amazon,"I have used this product before. It is like an antidepressant. It really seems to help if your dog has joint pain. I guess it still hurts, but evidently it makes them feel so much better, it doesn't hurt as much."
5,Best Product I Have Found,"DGP is the best product I have found for dogs that have any kind of issues with pain or mobility. I have used it on my dogs from 6 months to 14 years.My Rottie mix was diagnosed with elbow dysphasia at 6 months. He went through a grueling set of surgeries and recovery, and now has a steel plate in his leg, which really throws off his gait. With the addition of DGP to his diet, he is able to run and play without too much trouble. I tried several other products, and DGP seems to work the best. I also used it on my 10 year old pit bull, who could not get off her bed with out it. It is truly an amazing product and I would recommend it for dogs of all ages."
2,"Melissa, yes, but...","I basically got the album for one song, If this is Love, which is dynomite! The other songs are quite forgettable."
1,fish aren't decorations!,"This is much too small. If you want to look at fish as a picture, buy a picture. Otherwise get a real aquarium."
4,"Provides nice glow, but not what was expected","Understandable since these are natural crystals and all, but the one we received barely resembled any of the pictures shown online. Would've been good if they had mentioned that more clearly. Also, the tiny bulb inside blew out the moment we turned it on -- had to get a replacement at the hardware store. Other than that, we've gotten used to the look of it now and it does provide a beautiful glow -- more than a candle but less than a lamp."
3,Beware of ones with flat sides,I bought 2 salt lamps and one was ok but the other one has a straight flat side instead of a natural shape. It had been cut this way. I placed the flat smooth side toward the wall so it's not so noticable.You just don't know what you will get. I do have to say that the packaging was good unlike some reviewers.
2,Not very satisfied,"I purchased 2 lamps at the same time and were both delivered in the same packing box. both lamps were ontop of the light bulbs that go inside that rocks. They were both crushed. Then only one lamp worked. The second lamp gave me problems with fitting a certain size bulb, and the on/off switch is completely borken. Not able to turn on or off, button just popped right out of cord. I am very unhapp about this purchase! It could have been packaged better for the prices you charge for shipping. Meanwhile I pruchased 2 lamps and I only have 1 that works."
4,Change of heart.,I appreciate the contact made concerning my recent purchase of salt lamps from this vendor. The lamps worked fine and I was pleased. It was just the packaging that was mess up.
3,on and off or dim?,Anyone able to say if this on off switch is also a dimmer or not? Looking for one with a dimmer but only a few specifically say they do. Thanks!
5,salt lamp,my son loves his lamp. he loves the glow and i think it actually does help with his sinuses and the air in his room/
4,beautiful and energizing,"i have one at my desk at work and one by my bed at home. they offer wonderful ambient lighting, great mood decor, but the best part is is the atmospheric ionization! at this time my only regret is that i diddnt get a size or two bigger."
5,Interesting and luminous light,I bought this salt lamp for my ten year old grandson and he was thrilled. It looks beautiful in his bedroom and is functioning well. I have had one myself for five years in my living room and it looks and works great. A 15 watt bulb lasts much longer than a 25 watt bulb.Ronny Herman de Jong[...]
3,the beasts of barakhai,"In this action/fantasy book a young collage graduate by the name of Benton Collins is working in a university as a teacher's aid. While cleaning rat cages he unknowingly stumbles upon a whole other world a very unfamiliar one. Being late for thanksgiving and not eating all day, Benton Collins hungrily stumbles upon a rabbit in the woods. Oddly enough the creature isn't frightened by him. So he eats the helpless bunny difficultly while his stomach is full of guilt guards come and he later realizes in the world of Barakai. Humans are shape shifters and each animal turns in to a human. Ben is charged with murder and cannibalism and sentenced to hang. How will he get out of it? With some friends he meets on the way such as Falima the horse and Zylas the rat he finds it difficult to get back home and escape death but with the stone they all get rewarded. Watch the story unfold in this suspenseful story, The Beast of Barakai."
1,What!!?,I was actually looking for the soundtrack of the MOVIE Fools Rush In. Where can I find that at?
1,Fools Rush In,I am not at all interested in Monica Lewis. I also was looking for the movie sound track. Know where to find it? It was done by a group from Germany but I can't remember it's name.
3,Corrected Info,"There WAS a soundtrack to the Movie FOOLS RUSH IN with Matthew Perry, but it is very rare. Sadly, this is not it."
1,Chris Matt from Liechtenstein,buhhhh ! this is NOT the soundtrack of the movie FOOLS RUSH IN that I was looking for.
1,What is this???????????,"I need the Soundtrack fot Fools Rush In with Matthew Perry and Salma Hayek, where do I find it?"
3,Nice addition,"My husband and I purchased an aquarium similar to this and the results are beautiful, after a little TLC. We had no room on the floor for a large aquarium like I wanted, but when we saw this, it definitely met our needs. Like all small aquariums, one must realize the following: 1) small tank = small fish, 2) the number of fish for the space is limited, 3) small environmental changes = big changes to the aquarium, and 4) it's a tank with fish, and it needs to be cared for like any other pet home. One challenge is water changes, but most gravel cleaners will fit, and with a stepping stool for assistance, it is very doable challenge. Once the tank does stablize, as it did with us, it is an amazing addition to the house."
3,Quirky and fun!,"The author's quirky sense of humor was delightful, and I felt so much better about the angsts of being a woman over age 40 after reading this book. However, I was disappointed by the overall Christian tone, which I did not expect nor want. And there isn't much here about midlife motherhood and marriage. For the BEST overall comprehensive funny book about midlife, I recommend ""Parentally Insane: Insights From The Edge...of Midlife!"" by Julie Donner Andersen, whose humor is much more bluntly ""out there"" funny, and encompasses ALL of midlife, including motherhood and marriage. Still, ""Didn't My Skin Used To Fit?"" is good for a giggle or two if you are really hung up on the physical ravages of aging."
5,Couldn't Stop Laughing!!!,"This book is awesome! I started reading it and couldn't put it down! It is so funny, and much too true. I loved it. It should be read by every woman (and man married to a woman) between 35 and forever."
2,Is 40 really old?,"Don't really consider 40 year olds ""old"" and having the problems she describes in her book, but the inspirational comments are appropriate."
4,Laugh Lines,"This one is great for grins and giggles, but it is also thought-provoking at times. I like the division into short chapters. Great for busy, on-the-go ladies!"
4,Amusing and Full of Laughter,I so enjoyed the book. Amusing with a twist of the authors' sense of humor. I found myseld chuckling out loud and smiling while reading this book. Some of the instances I can relate to first hand. This book is one that provides insight of how we age with humor intent.
3,Lovely but overpriced.,"This is a wonderful show, but at $45 dollars for just four 86 minute episodes you have to ask yourself shouldn't I rent it from netflix?Yes that's right four disks with one episode each. They probebly could have gotten on to two, but then it would have been more obvious what alot of money it costs."
5,Good Work and Study Guide,"Although the depth of detail is less than you would find in individual works on the leaders and their work, this edition provides more than enough information for a great class study. Very appropriate for students sixth-grade and up to and including adults."
5,Pirate Bender - Red Beard Awesome Character!,"Pirate Bender - Red Beard is A Steal of a Deal!I purchased Pirate Bender (along with the Kung Pow bender) for my 32 year old son's refrigerator. My son is a former Airborne soldier, a hiker, mountain climber, skier, scuba diver and wonderful uncle to his 10 year old niece. The Benders are a GREAT DEAL FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY. The Benders will provide hours of fun and laughter with no electronics involved. If you want a great deal the Benders are a STEAL!"
5,vivid japanese folk,"akeboshi is the best indie folk artist in japan at this moment. this album is a compilation of his previous three eps with the addition of two new songs. akeboshi rose to fame with it's song 'wind' as the into to the anime naruto. being the first song on the album, it is hardly the most uplifting. each song is re-recorded from the eps and lulls you into a state of complete comfort. there is no artist that can be compared to akeboshi because it's composed with instruments that seem foreign to japan yet the style is very connected with japan's contemporary youth culture, juxtaposing slow melodic guitar and violin tracks with edgy grunge beats.this album is essential for anyone looking for the best of contemporary indie music in japan. it's well worth the price."
5,Two thumbs up!,Fantastic booster and so easy to clean! No nooks and crannies for food to get stuck. Soft and comfortable - my kids love it. I highly recommend it!
1,Something's Gone Wrong,"I'm not sure what Cooshee has done to this once wonderful product. We bought a black one (booster seat) a couple of years ago and LOVE it! Now it's time to buy one for the second kid (the first kid is still using hers). When the new one arrived, I was speechless! It was so toxic smelling that I wondered who could believe it was something for a child?! It was obviously painted. Our old one is not -- it seems to have some other kind of coating. Even if the smell would not have been an issue, the paint job was splotchy and sloppy.Needless to say, we sent this new one back. I told the people we ordered it from to send me a black one if it did not smell bad. This second one is painted as well and does smell bad; but they sent it to me anyway. I'm in the process of returning it as well.Really, the smell is enough to make you lose your appetite, so how can you expect your child to eat while sitting in it?!"
1,Will ruin wood furniture,"As other reviewers mentioned, the seat works fine but it ruined the finish on our new wood chair. We just bought this kitchen dining set too and I'm so upset. I didn't see the warning on the bottom that says not to use it on fine wood furniture. I wouldn't call what we have fine furniture, just a basic kitchen table and chairs. I had considered using a liner under the seat when I first bought it, but figured that would make the seat slip around and my son wouldn't be able to get in and out by himself. If you have plastic chairs, this would be a great product. I'm not sure how it would do on fabric."
3,great idea -- w some drawbacks,"Really soft and comfortable however, make sure to ""unplug"" the seat after every meal or else your wooden chair will have marks and will be sticky from the Cooshee seat. Now I have to figure out how to remove that gunk out of my nice chair! Wish I had known right-a-away about this nuisance!"
1,Utter ego spouting trash,If I ever hear hamburger universe again I shall become nauseated. The biggest waste of money I ever spent. He rambles on and on with no proof of what he says beyond vague reference. It is three hours and twenty minutes of ego driven drivel.
2,Very Poor,"I am sorry to say that this so called DVD is a complete and utter waste of money. Far from me to cast an opinion on Dr Ledwith, yet this highly un-professional school boy type movie should not have even got past the teacher, let alone onto the market. If this were free, i would still feel that i had wasted my time watching this amature, super low budget disk together, but to charge top $ ----- i must have been crazy.....The best Dr Ledwith could do with this poorly put together piece of film would be to put it on his hamburger web-site free of charge.I think Dr Ledwith has been in the USA too long,,,, nice guy, just ripping us off though.Sorry Dr Ledwith - i waited and wanted a good movie here, what i got was a 5 year old childs version of making a movie....In short,,,,, dont buy it"
5,Un Documental importante,"En Venezuela y America Latina la mayoría de los paradigmas han sido sembrados por la Iglesia Católica. Las creencias en esos pueblos es que ser rico es malo, que solamente son salvados si aceptan a Jesús como su único salvador, que los curas solamente son los que absuelven los ""pecados"". En fin, este Documental es necesario que todo el mundo lo analice y discuta para que nos demos cuenta que existen otros senderos, otras verdades y sobre todo no encasillarnos a lo que nos dice unas Instituciones creadas por el hombre como las Iglesias. Abramos nuestras mentes para concebir otros pensamientos..."
1,Doors do not stay shut,"Bought this for the volume, put it together following the instructions to the letter. After repeated adjustments of the doors it's apparent that they will not close with box sets in the cabinet. The drawers are glued together without so much as a screw and feel flimsy. Some of our boxed sets can't be taken out as separate cases so we're stuck with using child-proof locks to hold the doors closed. Looks very ugly and catches your shin when you walk by. We will be tossing this as soon as we have our house, brand-new or not, and will never buy this manufacturer again.One star because that's the minimum rating. AVOID!!!"
3,dj lighting,I bought these for my PARs38.The product was exactly how it was describe on the site.It was shipped fairly fast. ITS OK for the price.
1,its okay,"i personally just dont use it. so i would not buy it again, its not that there is antthing wrong, i just have no use for it."
5,great berimbau,"i'm not an expert on berimbaus, this is my first one but i can tell you that this is a really well constucted, quality berimbau.. it's easy to set up, and easy to play.. you dont have to be a great music master to play this, if you can keep a beat and do more than one thing at a time then you'll be fine.. a little more expensive than some of the other listings you get what you pay for.. i recommend buying this one.."
1,Really bad,"I fellow student at my Capoeira academy got one of these, looks just like the picture (after you string it). Tiny sound, the wood does not look like biriba, it is too stiff. For $95 you can get a real berimbau from other sellers like VirtualCapoeira, capoeira dot com, or capoeira-shop. Don't waste your money here."
2,"Warning, straight piece of wood!!","I bought this berimbau thinking it would be at somewhat like the picture. The berimbau arrived straight with no bend. The seller does not mention any of the instructions in the description, that it is shipped as straight piece of wood. The arame broke the first day trying to tune the instrument, since per the instructions ""You may find when you first receive your Berimbau, the tone is not pleasing, since it is purposely shipped out of tune"". Would not buy again from this seller."
3,"I love ""Lost Series"" of Nova --""the Bermuda Triangle""-- No more Progess , but gave us "" Remind Again"" !","The ""Bermuda Triangle"" can be defined asDisapperance of Airplanes or Vessels withoutobious, explainable causes in the area of Oceansconfined as Triangle in Bermuda--Puerto rico-- Miami,Florida.1st officially raised case was Silent,Disappearing of5-TBM Avenger,Flight19 GROUP ON 16,Sept,1950.cause of Disappearing were suggested Natural disaster,piarate,equipnental failure, human error,etc.---Unknown!Among many theories, 1)Physic. 2)Extra-earth Person ?"
4,Pretty good.,"Good quality, works well. Connectors fit snugly into the devices. isn't much more to say about them, they do what they're supposed to."
2,Synthetic coupling,A disappointment. While they were kindred spirits Count Basie and Ray Charles never actually recorded together. This imported recording combines the two on some of Ray's lesser known tunes. In fact the recorded tunes are not even the same ones listed on the liner notes. ???There's a better though also disappointing record that applies the current Count Basie ghost band plus organist Joey DiFrancesco to some of Ray's hits. Better but still not the real thing. After all Ray Charles led his own big band.
4,Good But Some Reservations,"Looks great. The lamp is quite bright and aesthetically pleasing but don't count on using it to illuminate much more than the immediate surrounding area. The rechargable solar battery lasted well into the early morning hours and is standard AAA size that can be easily replaced....a definate plus. Because the frame is wood, the seams began to darken shortly after exposure to the elements which lessened its overall appearance."
3,This one's pretty neutral (leaning towards below average),"Not a terrible movie, but not a very good one either. The plot is flat, and the characters become tiresome. The historical setting of 19th century Cuba was the most interesting aspect of this movie, unless you are a fan of big lips and...ahem...other larger than average stuff about Angelina Jolie, that she blatantly shows off here. There is extremely little substance to take away from this film, but on a sort of pathetic level, I did appreciate Antonio Banderas's effort at trying to act in this film. Good job Antonio!"
3,A Twisted Tale of Sex and Crime,"I went to the matinee without taking care to see the title of the movie and so, no complaints. It was a theatre with a capacity of about 500 and as the film began to roll there were only five others besides me. As the movie proceeded, a question pounded in my mind. What makes a movie? A few nude scenes, bloody shootings, unnatural coincidences, and a love triangle. Well, this movie was satisfying with all that plus a few twists of the story. No wonder the movie hall was empty. It is a movie directed by Michael Cristofer and acted out somewhat well by Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie and Thomas Jane in the backdrop of Havana a hundred years back. There is also a little religion, as though to justify the title."
3,allcanadianguy@shaw reviews * * *,"Original Sin (2001)Who would like this? : romantic, drama & mystery fansWorth seeing?...-buy it : no-rent it : yesCast:Antonio BanderasAngelina JolieJack ThompsonThomas JanePedro ArmendarizGregory ItzinAllison MackieJoan PringleCordelia RichardsJames Haven Voight_________________________Michael CristoferDirector* An average movie but worth seeing. Hard to put these two pretty faces into a movie and try and make it a believable period film."
3,CHEAP MELODRAMA?,"""Original Sin"" is yet another of those cheesy tales of bad love, disillusionment, revenge and possible redemption we can't seem to get enough of; as such, it has all the usual strengths and weaknesses. ... Much panned by critics and a letdown at the box office, this is actually a much better example of its genre than one might first believe. The leads are engaging (particularly the dazzling Jolie), the mystery deep and dark, and the depiction of Eros and the madness induced by his poison arrows true to life. Michael Cristofer's direction is fluid and frequently original, even if his story is not. The film's primary handicaps are a flagging pace in the middle and some glaringly bad dialogue. Of course this isn't high drama, but the viewer who doesn't expect too much should find ""Original Sin"" a generally fun and mostly painless way to waste a couple of expendable hours."
3,Kinky Flick,"This is one pretty kinky flick starring Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas, both of whom are naked throughout most of the movie. There's at least a full half hour of Angelina topless with her buttocks also exposed, perfectly paired alongside Antonio Banderas to show off their bodies. These movies are really just the actors showing off their bodies mostly."
3,Somewhat disappointing...,"I went into this film expecting a romantic thriller with the ever talented Angelina Jolie, but came out disappointed. The film is very basic, yet at times difficult to follow. Angelina Jolie seemed to be a composite of her former characters - throughout, I would turn to the friend I went with and comment that the mannerism in that scene was a reflection of one of her previous roles. This is soft pornography that passes itself off as a drama. Director Michael Cristofer continuously broke the 180 degree rule, giving some scenes a sense of schizophreny, and jump cuts were used to a degree that made the film at times, a mere annoyance."
5,Great Movie,Angelina Jolie is stunningly attractive in this movie...all of her. The movie has great visual affect.
3,"Good, trashy fun","Ok, Original Sin is not the kind of movie that wins academy awards, and most reviewers really trashed it, but I enjoyed it anyway. Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie are an attractive and charismatic pair, and the lush scenery (set it Cuba, I believe filmed in Mexico)and interesting, if not always logical or believable story make for good entertainment. Original Sin deals with a painful paradox --being madly in love with someone you know you can't trust. Even the overwrought melodrama and sometimes silly dialogue do not take away the basic fascination of this sort of eternal human problem. A flawed film with some very good qualities, I wish it had been better."
4,"GREAT AMBIENCE, MUSIC AND FLOW","I loved this picture. I love the soundtrack (can't find it anywhere) and the beautiful scenery. The critics hated this film to the same degree that I loved it. The choreography, settings and photoshots were really interesting magnified by the great music. I found it awe-inspiring, all ending in a wonderful way esp with the song with the credits at the great culmination of the film."
4,One of Angelina's Sexiest,"""Original Sin"" is probably Angelina Jolie's sexiest movie since ""Gia.""The movie ""Original Sin"" is about an aristocrat seeking a wife from far away. With picture in hand Luis (played by Antonio Banderas) goes to claim the lovely Julia (played by Angelina Jolie) which whom he is supposed to make his wife. From that time forward, his world is filled with secret, lies, deceit, and sex.I personally loved this movie, despite the reviews some have given it. It's full of twists and turns and surprises. Banderas and Jolie have great chemistry in it as well.I'd only warn young viewers because of the strong sexual content in a particular scene, as well as some violence (some of a sexual nature). Pick this one up; you won't be dissapointed."
2,Jolie's lips more real than ludicrous thriller she stars in,"Original Sin (2001) Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie, Thomas Jane, Jack Thompson, Gregory Itzin, Allison Mackie, Joan Pringle, Cordelia Richards, D: Michael Cristofer. Superlative actors and a lush style are diluted from a languid and nonsensical story made into a downer of a movie, which adapts Cornell Woolrich's novel, Waltz into Darkness. Banderas as a Cuban 19th century coffee plantation owner meets his gorgeous mail-order-bride from America for the very first time and falls in love, but she isn't whom she says she is when he goes on a wild goose chase looking for her. Viewers that are interested may revere more than anything the sight of Jolie's lips in close-ups and the overheated sex scenes. Running Time: 112 minutes and rated R for strong sexual content and some violence."
2,This Movie Was Bad,"The only thing that was remotly good about this movie was Angelina Jolie getting naked countless times over. whenever the movie slowed down (which it often did) the movie just had her get naked and they thought it would save it. Such a horrible stupid, corny film."
2,avert your eyes,Every now and then a movie comes along that is so bad it's funny. Original Sin took two of the sexiest people alive and made them look ridiculous. The movie has a great plot but the execution is painful. Angelina spends too much time pouting and strutting. Antonio's Luis is made to look like a fool. The ending is pathetic and the sex scenes made me laugh. The dialouge is stiff and the whole film looks like grease was smeared on the camera lens.
1,original sin. don't do it.,"this is the first time i've ever felt it necessary to write a review of a movie. this is because this movie is So Deplorably Miserably Incomparably Bad that i feel compelled, nay, Required to tell you, the intelligent audience, to skip this one altogether. not since ""Jack Frost"" (He's Chillin' He's Killin') has there been a movie of such ghastly caliber. then again, perhaps it was supposed to be that bad...Do yourself a favor, call your mom, clean your house, rearrange your silverware drawer, but don't waste your time watching original sin."
3,This belongs in the same category as Showgirls,"Everything about Original Sin screams ""this movie is so bad it's good"" from the opening shot of the film, to the campy acting, and the chemistry between Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie. When Luis (Banderas), a wealthy plantation owner, meets his mail order bride (Jolie, beautiful as ever), he gets a lot more than he bargained for when he learns that all is not what it seems. Director Michael Cristofer (who directed Jolie in her star making role in Gia) makes Luis seem more stupid than love struck, but throughout most of the film it seems most of the actors don't take any of this seriously. All in all, Original Sin is worth a look, but it is about as logical and alluring as late night premium channel porn."
4,Love hurts,"Ok, this may a bit thin on plot, but really it's a story of love and passion, and how a person can be blinded by those. Burned. Destroyed. Willing to throw everything away. Consumed.The chemistry between Banderas and Jolie burns up the screen and really makes this story work.There are enough twists in the story to keep it interesting. It moves along nicely and is fun to watch."
1,I've made a Terrible Sin Watching Original Sin.,"Original Sin does not make sense,Antonio Banderas(Who has been involved with A Che Guevara Movie and therefore lost my respect,Whom I have never liked and has a horrible accent.)Plays a really Idiotic So-called ""Titan Of Industry"" falls for a Charlatan or Lady of the night,A lot of Nudity from Angelina Jolie who by the way makes me sick(She kissed her brother and not in a kiss between Siblings but Incest,Gross and she has a Che Tattoo.)Also despite it being ""Entertainment""(So-called) and Fiction.It goes beyond that,It is historically Inaccurate Cuba does not Look Like Mexico and Several other but typical of Movies and Hollywood and popular mindset in General about Cuba.The movie is just sleaze,a Notch above Skin-a-max flick.The acting is horrible and the buy a wife storyline is worst."
4,"If it's so bad, why does it sell out so often?","When this film first came out on DVD, I went to about 3 different stores to get a copy of it for myself and every time it was sold out. Whenever this film is discussed people go to great lengths to bash the story, the acting, the cheesy ending, etc, but almost everyone I've talked to has seen it. That says quite a lot about the beautiful Angelina Jolie and the gorgeous Antonio Banderas.Yes, most of the plot is contrived and the happy ending given to the main characters was a letdown, but hey at least Thomas Jane had a ball as the bad guy! Much has been said about Angelina and Antonio, but Thomas seemed to really enjoy playing the villainous Billy. He was over the top, more than slightly bisexual and incredibly sexy.The cinematography of Mexico (portrayed as Cuba) is as lush and enticing as the lead actors and the music was gorgeous. All in all, a good, sexy romp."
4,"hot,hot,hot","it is a rather different love story,wth passion, betrayal and devotion finally.I think it s the hottest move in both jolie`s and Banderas's filmographies.She is a femme fatale.As being a big fan of hers I loved the movie."
5,Going Through Changes,"I promised myself never to rate my own stuff, but this film has always been a special part of my work and I was going through a lot at the time. It is one of my personal favorites"
3,Origianl Sin,"I saw this at the theater, and I couldn't take my eyes off Angelina Jolie. Yet I think she has this affect in every movie she makes. It's a little twisted, and lots of body showing, but I liked it."
2,Steamy Cuban Nonsense,"Sets, costumes...all spectacular. Antonio Banderas is stunning to behold. But the true stars are Angelina Jolie's grotesquely over-colligened lips. Or are they transplanted labia majora? They were distracting to the point of making my recently-eaten supper come up and burn my throat with acid reflux."
1,Horrible movie,"What a waste of time and money. I wanted to turn it off, but after buying this movie I figured I had better watch the whole thing. Nobody could be as stupid as Antonio Banderas is in this movie. If you must, rent this, do not buy it."
2,Boring dumb plot,"**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**Antonio Bandaras's character is so dumb that even after Angelina's character has played him over and over, he still comes back to her. One part of the movie especially annoyed me, and that was the scene where he is having a poker game and Angelina is giving him hand signals to show what cards they have. Does anyone else think it is really stupid that they thought the men wouldn't notice she continually walks around the table over and over and over, and he keeps looking at her? Seriously that must have been one of the dumbest things I have ever seen. As far as the ending, really dumb, she is acting like she is playing both men throughout the whole movie and then all of a sudden she is in love with him. The movie was boring."
5,"IT'S JUST ME, BUT:",JOLIE IS GREAT AS THE THEIVING MAIL ORDER BRIDE. bANDERAS IS GREAT AS THE WEALTHY LAND ORDER WHO NEEDS THE MAIL ORDER BRIDE. JM
1,Truly awful...,"I have seen some truly terrible films in my time, however this utter piece of crap surely takes the cake. Even the prospect of seeing the gorgeous Angelina Jolie naked did not save this film from artistic hell. If your idea of eroticism is Showgirls or Basic Instinct then you are bound to love this piece of trash."
3,"OK, Long Movie",This is a very suspenseful and kinda weird movie as it is set in the 19th century. There is some good acting by the leading stars like Antonio and Angelina. THe movie is very fascinating but it is a little too drawn out and the setting of the movie in the 19th century makes the movie have a very strange feel to it which kinda depresses one. But overall an ok film
3,Simulated?,"This ""unrated edition"" of an otherwise moderately entertaining mainstream melodrama features a ""simulated"" sex scene between Jolie and Banderas. According to the director's commentary during that scene, the stars didn't wear any of the tape or invisible g-strings usually worn by movie stars in such scenes. He also cryptically indicated that after he filmed them in various states of post coital repose, they got busy. Watching the scene, it's hard to believe it's pure acting. I can only imagine that highly protective Melanie Griffith wasn't shown the ""dailies"" for that scene -- but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that quirky Billy Bob saw it and liked it."
2,Amateurish,"Perhaps the training I received at UCLA in Theater Arts/Motion Pictures has ""spoiled"" me. A better word of course would be ""made me more discerning."" But then I also remember many of the old time films, directors, actors. I have to agree with the negative reviews this movie received. It is so amateurishly directed that I could not stand to view it all the way through but had to turn it off in disgust half the way through. The amateurish direction resulted in poor acting (though Banderas tried his best he was hamstrung by faulty direction). Of course a really good actor would shine through even the worst of films as John Barrymore did.But as long as there is the glamor & glitz of Hollywood, fans will be mesmerized by the stars & will have no discernment as to what is poor & what is not."
5,Original Sin ~ Antonio Banderas & Angelina Joli,"I'm not a lady to be please to easely, But I do like a good plot when I see it, and for me ""ORIGINAL SIN "" is the icing of the cake, this movie has a great plot. I like the time it took place because I love to see movies made in Olden Times.If you ignore the nude scenes you have a great story.I love this movie so much I went to see it 4 times in the movie theater. I do wish the Joli and Banderas continue making movies together, they sure make a great couple.Antonio & Angelina "" Que Dios Los Bendiga.This movie brought me memories of my grandfather when he live in Cuba for a lot of years. Beautiful, Beautiful, Movie I love it. So I give it 5***** stars I wish I could give a Thousand stars because I would, and I'm Buying it VHS and DVD.Gracias."
3,Love Is Blind,"Here's a ""steamy"" film - at least early on - about a Cuban (Antonio Bandaras_ who marries an American woman he had only previously written to, only to find out later she (Angelina Jolie) wasn't that woman but a scheming impostor (Billy Bob found this out in real life!)This is nicely photographed, ""lush"" being the best adjective to describe it. I didn't find the story very involving, yet it wasn't boring and I could relate to Bandaras' character. Perhaps many men could with the old ""love is blind"" story.****possible spoileers****This is one of those films with poor messages here and there where corrupt people live happily ever after despite their overt sins. There is an ""R"" version and a ""unrated"" version of this film, the latter being two minutes longer."
2,Loose Lips Sink Ships,"This film has two very gorgeous, sensual actors in steamy love scenes that are vaguely interesting. At first I wondered how close this might have been to receiving an X Rating. Their lips seemed like the focal point of the film, and it seemed a finger was always going into the others mouth or into their own. Jarring scene changes, choppy edits, dizzying camera work, and at times, unnecessary tricks, all failed to add purpose to the plot. All this to frenetic cuban music, which was good, as was the scenery, whick mostly consisted of balconies and white curtains blowing in the wind. The low point was a scene that involved spitting, you'll know what I mean when you see it. The high point was watching a person make such a sniveling idiot of himself. The two of them are not hard to look at. I'll be dreaming of fingers and lips all night."
1,Arrived unplayable,"This ""new"" dvd arrived unplayable, even after trying it in three different players, cleaning it and trying it again. Did not return because I threw it out. My bad. Not concerned about a refund. If I buy something label ""new"", then I expect it to work. Found a better supplier for my future movies."
5,Original Sin,Once again Angelina Jolie and Antonio Bandres deliver a great film. She delivers her story and I was wondering if she was actually a ghost to him or he really lived it. She protrays a woman who is sent to meet a husband and takes a turn for not what you expect. This is a wonderful movie and I enjoyed it. Great condition and fast service.
4,"Original Sin ""fantastic chick-flick""","This film was an excellent purchase, it starts off a little slow but it's a great chick-flick, about love and suduction. The moral of the story is real love can see u through anything even the darkest of times and it can bring new light- great movie Angelina is at her sexiest in this."
3,Only worth the cost of a rental!,"Antonio Banderas plays a wealthy Cuban coffee merchant. He's reached a point in his life where he feels he needs a wife. He's been corresponding with an American woman and has asked for her hand in marriage. When she arrives in Cuba, she tells him that the picture she sent was not her because she didn't want him to fall for her just because she was beautiful. What follows from this point is not necessarily one of the worst films ever, and most certainly not one of the steamiest movies ever made. At it heart, this is not a bad story. I just don't believe the director displayed this film to its potential. Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie both do a wonderful job with the script they were given. This film, at its best is a rental."
4,a twisty erotic tale with a dark feeling to it,"I loved this picture! In Germany it opened a week after ""Tomb Raider"" (so Angelina Jolie was one of the reasons I went to see it), and because it was praised as a love story, I took my girlfriend - and she also loved it! Jolie (more beautiful than ever in those costumes), Banderas and Thomas Jane (""Thursday"") did a good job in their roles, but mostly the erotic and morbid atmosphere of Havanna during carneval was what made the movie so pleasent to watch. The story-twists were good, it was exelently shot - only the ending was a bit of a disapointment, simply because the director chose to lighten up the dark theme of the movie with a happy ending, which doesn't really fit into the flow. To sum it all up: This is not popcorn-cinema! It's a dark love story with great atmosphere! I fully recomend it, although it isn't a movie for all audiences..."
3,Not as in-depth as I would have wanted.,I was expecting longer meditations on the Psalms each day. Some were only a sentence long. Otherwise it is good to have a psalm for every day.
3,Price Discrepencies,When I clicked on this item to order it shows the current price reduced to 59.00. Yet on my bill your charging me $79.99.Why is that and if it is 79.99 I dont want it.
2,Incorrect size...,"Brushes were the corect # seller listed for my Dremel Moto-Tool 380-6, but slightly too large. No response from seller when I emailed them. Was able to use by filing them down, but not correct."
5,Fixed my dremmel,"My old dremmel tool started to die and required it to be shook to maintain operation. After finally becoming completely frustrated, I finally came to my senses and remembered this thing has replaceable brushes. I took them out, and sure enough they are very work out. After a short amount of searching on the Internet I found the correct replacements and ordered them up. Upon arrival, I promptly installed them into my tool. I then turned it on, and it ran like the day it was new."
2,"too old, not enough cultural","too much emphasis on music and group recreation, not enough nuts and bolts as to how gypsy life works. the age of the book precludes the WW2 and communist era impacts. ""Bury Me Standing"" is a much better study of gypsy life."
3,Second Read,"I had read this book years ago and got to thinking about it one day. I ordered it from amazon.com and was pleased that I only paid a minimal amount for it. The story isn't bad but the language is a bit overblown at times. Still, an enjoyable read, and it must be said that I finished it in one sitting."
2,synopsis from back cover,"Nickie's been in love with Miguel-secretly, hopelessly in love-for as long as she can remember. Hopelessly because Miguel has been trapped in an arranged marriage. But Nickie did nothing to compromise that marriage! She even left the state. Now she learns that Miguel has initiated divorce proceeding. His wife is countersuing, bringing a charge of adultery against him-and Nickie!"
5,Strunk's student becomes the teacher,"Wow. This book is a treasure chest; I resorted to folding the corners of dozens of pages so I could easily relocate some of its gems.You will hate reaching the end of this book, but you will come away with renewed powers to observe life's little treasures of daily experience.Seeing the world through the eyes of E. B. White is an inspiring privelege, and this book enables that. If books were cookies, this one would win a whopping big prize."
4,Every writer should read this.,this book is required reading for a writing seminar I'm attending in Seattle in April. Everyone who's thinking about being a writer should read this book.
5,Always Interesting,"As part of my Christmas giving, I decided to share the work of one of my favorite authors with my grandchildren. This was one title I selected. White's style is so easy and pleasurable; it's a true delight to be savored over and over. A master of his craft."
5,Excellence in English,"E.B. White is a fantastic, skillful writer and his essays are the perfect introduction to his work. They are relatively short pieces and highly enjoyable; I read them while traveling."
4,Love IT,"Classics are such a delight. This is no exception, as I might have expected since it was recommended by John Updike in Due Considerations!"
5,A Wonderful Book,"Every now & then, when I need to be reminded what really good writing is, this is the book I turn to. If your only exposure to his work is the childhood reading of Charlotte's Web & Stuart Little, then you are in for a treat. This is a book to return to again & again for his clarity & wonderful use of language."
4,From abortion to the Zenger trial,"From abortion to the Zenger trial. This massive book covers everything (or just about): the heroes, the tragedies, the darker moments, Presidents, inventors, wars, government, ideologies, movements, culture, entertainment, science, art, religion. There are 1,400 entries and some 900 historians.While there are some questionable individuals and subjects inserted, others just as noteworthy are forgotten. It is of course a monumental undertaking; data will come up short periodically; should be complemented with other sources, such as ""A Patriots Guide to US History"". This treasure is in dictionary form: fairly written, convenient to use, and not dry. A reference that should be in all households.Wish you wellScott"
5,A Hidden Treasure,This limited edition release by Bradley Denton might only be for hard-core Denton fans as it is both pricey and in hardcover only. Newbies to the work of Denton might be better served by reading Blackburn or Buddy Holly is Alive and Well on Ganymede but for old time fans it is a needed addition to the collection. As always with Bradley it might not be politically correct but it is right on target and hilarious to boot.
2,Mixed Bag needs a dual rating Hawaii = 0 stars memory = 4,"This is a dual CD. The first part, Hawaii, is lousy. I likeHawaiian music, but you can't make a symphony of it. It'd bedifficult with any big band, but add strings and you've lost it.The second part, Memories, is interesting. Can't imagine where they got the names for many of the pieces, they're wierd.The music is fine, well recorded, and interesting for the mostpart.I do have trouble with the trombone section on several of the songs. They're usually wonderful, but the arrangement usestoo modern chords and gives a sour, off-key sound that doesn't really fit. Fortunately the sax section comes in and saves theday on several pieces."
3,OK,"I did a quick comparison to see if this wheel is worth what I paid. I compared it to my $10 diamond blade that I got from HD. I don't remember if it was Husky or Workforce. It turns out that my cheap (year old) blade cut ceramic tile faster than this brand new blade. this was just a fast comparison, so I cant say anything for certain."
1,Deceitful Garbage,"Do not rent or buy this movie. It is unauthorized garbage, full of stock photos and uninformed opinion. No music, not approved by Bruce. Get it off Amazon!"
3,Book is ok.,"Shipping was quick, the tracking was nonexistent the number they provided was incorrect. The book is missing a dvd that is part of the book. The condition of the book looks like it has been used 3/4 times and the missing dvd is an issue."
4,Bring on the Dog!,I bought this just for the unreleased Houndog Taylor tracks. The rest is very good.
4,Good Blues Set,"Good stuff. Son Seals and Luther Allison offer the highlights, but to be honest there aren't too many low spots. Alligator is a great blues label, so obviously a compilation of this sort will be strong. This is a great set for anyone new to the blues - a great introduction to some of the best out there."
3,Classic Hopalong. Character triumphs over evil again.,Hoppy comes to the aid of a school teacher in the Old West. Evil men are intent on using her to further their own ends. Hoppy rides to save her. Classic William Boyd action. Very enjoyable. Well made film for the time.
1,Item received is not Item Pictured or described.,"I received a package containing a box labeled:ValleyPUGP3-3I 3""/ 75mm Gear Puller (3 jaw).-Picture of the one pictured here on AmazonBut the box contained a totally different puller.Company claims it was a mistake and sent wrong one but I find this hard to believe. The box has a picture of the same puller on it. And company opted to refund my money instead of sending me the puller pictured in the ad. Although they did let me keep the puller they did send. But puller sent is crap and wont work on what I need it for. Hooks are to big and from the picture of the one in the ad I am confident that it would have worked for what I needed it for.So 1 star for being the wrong item. Otherwise judging from the photo in the ad. If I had gotten that one it probably would have been a great tool and worked.Bottom line do not order this tool from Toolprice via Amazon.com there is no way of knowing whether you will have the same experience as I have had."
1,Beyond Disappointing,I love Mary Higgins Clark books but somehow they don't convert to good movies. This movie had very poor acting and it made the movie extremely hard to watch. I should have just reread the book instead of wasting my time and money on this movie.
2,How to ruin a great band in one easy lession.,"This is my very first review. I love ProgRock. I am in a band. I own over 4,ooo CDs and over 200 DVDs. Collage was a good band, Satellite was a great band but with a new name and a new chick singer they miss the mark compleatly. This is a good band drounded in Honey and covered up with sugar. It just doesn't work. Go with the last Satellite DVD with the Armenian singer/ bass player. And/or the last 2 Satellite CDs. This is a lemon and I want my money back. Long live ProgRock with power and glory. The new 'Believe' CD is what I'm talking about! PEACE !"
3,Rug Braiding Book,"The book I received was a discarded library book. For the purpose of my purchase, this was fine. If I were giving it as a gift, I would have been disappointed. I think that the books should be noted if they are library discards."
1,Misleading addvertisement,"I ordered the drill thinking it would come with 8 drill points, as was indicated in the advertisement. When it arrived it only had 3. It was obvious that the drill had been removed from the package and 5 drill points were removed. The drill was replaced in the package and the written description of the contents had been marked out with a permanent marker. I was able to remove the marker with solvent to see what had been marked out. I returned the drill with the above explanation and ordered another one. Another one was sent again missing 5 of the 8 drill points. I returned th more recent one for a full refund."
5,An old classic that still excels.,"The Stanley 03-043 push drill appears identical to that which my father owned and used. Mine is far newer, but works the same. One puts a bit in the supplied chuck and push the handle toward the wood, upon which an internal spiral spins the bit. A spring returns the handle to its starting position when the pressure is released. What makes the drill so useful is that it needs no electricity, is very light, and surprisingly fast. This is a small-scale drill for making pilot holes for screws, or small holes in wood for any purpose. It is easier and faster in many cases to use this than to use a cordless electric drill, of which I have several. The drill comes supplied with bits, which in my case have lasted for years. Highly recommended."
1,Misleading Ad: should be pulled or clarified,"I purchased this tool and also found it came with 3 bits, two of which were the same size. Exhaustive searching has located no bits (beyond the two sizes already with the bit).The ad should clearly state what bits actually come with the tool. As it is I now have a overpriced discontinued ""antique"" tool that can only be sold to another sucker. A search did turn up a modern reincarnation of the Stanley pushdrill made by Lara."
5,"""Flowers Afloat"", a history of the English canal boats","Tony Lewery is an English Signwriter (Sign painter) who has made a life's work of studying the history of the English canal boat and their decoration. He is a practicing sign artist and his work still includes the decoration of the canal boats. When the canals in England were built they were made narrow and shallow to conserve funds. Consequently the boats were made narrow and long. They often were only seven feet wide and 70' long. The owners lived aboard in a small cabin in the stern of the boat and took pride in the decoration of their boats. A tradition of ""Roses and Castles"" evolved in their decoration. This tradition has been carried on to the present day. The book chronicles the various boat yards that built and decorated these ""narrowboats"" over the years and the history of the canal system itself. The boats seldom carry any more commercial cargo and now many of them are available for charter for vacations."
3,"Cute shoes, super uncomfortable!","I bought these shoes to go with my black suit for interviews. They look fantastic. Very sexy, very professional, and they elongate my short legs. Holy crap are they uncomfortable though! I'm so glad I decided to break them in some before I wore them on an interview. Yikes. Eight hours of these and you want to saw your own feet off at the ankle. But I think that's generally a Steve Madden thing. All my Steve Maddens started out ridiculously painful until broken in. Good luck!"
2,not exactly old school heavy,"Poppy- not even punkish. I was looking for old school heavy, punkish surfer style - just a fun in your face sound- but this lacks it. All of it sounds like that group Oasis or european style influences."
5,THIS CD IS GREEEEEAT!,"the cd is brilliant and if ur thinking about getting it, then do get it!! its fantastic!! and the lads aint bad either!! i cant wait til i c them next march @ wembley! GREAT CD!"
4,Fantastic,The dvd was just as good as I had hoped it would be and kept me laughing the whole time it was playing. I'll be looking for more!
2,Redneck Comedy Roundup 1 & 2,"I like their later stuff a lot better. It was Okay. The price was right since it was on sale, but I would never pay full price. In fact, I didn't keep it in my collection. I gave it to the Senior Center as a Bingo Prize."
4,Blue Collar The Early Years,3 of the Blue Collar guys in the club days with a few other comedians randomly put in their. (Clip show)
3,Pre - blue collar days,"If you find this on sale, then you might want to buy it. Otherwise rent it. Foxworthy is funny, but Ron and Bill had a lot of practicing to do before they were famous. I bought this on sale, but for other people just wanting to laugh for one night, YouTube this or rent it."
3,Really old footage,This is just a bunch of clips from comedy club appearances back in the 70s. Some funny stuff but not much and several appearances by Bill Ingval had repeated material.
2,bad disc 2,"this is a 2 disc set, however, the second disc has the exact same bits that are on the first one with just a couple new ones put in. The first disc is mildly entertaining. it shows comedy bits from comedians before they were famous, or funny."
5,INCREDIBLE STUFF!,I wanted to put a black out shade over my window but not in the conventional way..I bought the shade just slightly wider than my window...Took it off the roller it came on and all it could think of was staple the shade around the window...Then I remembered Vecro made velcro tape....It worked like a charm and I can easily roll it up and get fresh air then just restick it to the wall...FABULOUS!! and I have my dark room too....I couldn't be happier
5,The Change'll Do You Good,"As a Human Resource Professional, ""The Change'll Do You Good"" is a very enlightening and educational book. This book brings an awareness of what women experience, and how it sometimes affects the behavioral patterns in the everyday workplace. Thus, management can deal with this issue in a professional manner. I would not only recommend this book to friends, but also to Human Resource Professionals and Executive management."
3,labios rojos,I enjoyed this movie. It had some funny parts. Both Silvia Navarro (huge fan of hers) and Jorge Salinas are great actors and they did a good job.I just wished that the movie was a bit longer and showed a little more of the woman's perspective on the subject.
5,coat rack was easy to assemble.,"We love it. My wife asked for one for Christmas, and she absolutely loves this one! IT is the cheapest one I could find, but it is exactly what she wanted."
1,Review,The product is very poorly made. I kept both of them because it was too much of a hassle to send back.
2,Tipsy,This stand is extremely lightweight and has a tendency to fall over every time a coat is placed off balance. It's not what I expected and am disappointed every time I have to pick up all the coats on the floor. I would not buy this again.
1,Crappy Packaging,"received my coat hanger today, and was incredibly disappointed by how poorly the item was packaged. the box did not fit the items enclosed, was missing one end of the cardboard, and you could clearly see the item through the packaging tape. how it made it i'm not sure. items inside ""box"" were not restrained from bouncing off of each other, and several items weren't even wrapped. minor damage was sustained, tho not enough to justify return postage. would NOT use this seller again, and would NOT recommend them to others. as far as the coat rack goes, it does have a design flaw that makes it wobble, but otherwise works fine. it's a cheap coat rack, keep your expectations low if you do decide to get it. one star rating earned for lousy wrap job and being an otherwise crappy member of the Amazon community."
2,cheaply made,the base is not sturdy and the rack has fallen on more than one occasion. Even the plastic sleeve that fits over the base does not stay in one place
1,"It's cheap indeed, just as their service. Came missing part and never got it.","I bought this hat rack thinking ""I just need something to hold my suit when I come back from work"". I should've just gotten a wall hook... It's sooo cheap looking and ugly that I kept it hid in my bedroom, guests please leave your jackets on the sofa anyways.What really pissed me off was the fact that it came missing one piece, one of the hooks. I contacted the company to get the missing part or a product exchange, they replied days after saying it was on the way... never got it, it's been more than two months.They don't care at all. Flash news, customers do care, at least to get the product in whole, which we paid for!!!"
2,"product is fine, communication wasn't","I ordered this item on October 5. It was supposed to have been delivered within the window on Oct. 10-18. I e-mailed e-toys twice and received no response. Finally, on October 25, it came in the mail, just in time for Halloween. I won't be using this seller again."
1,I got had!!!!,I shopped for hours between stores and did thorough research on this product. I bought two. One wouldn't even blow up it was so broken and the other one only half of it held the air for a very short time. It is too expensive to ship them back. I will never purchase this type of item online again. I went to the corner drugstore and found much better stronger ones on sale for $5.00. These things cost $20.00 So I bit the dust and I am calling it a big lesson learned.Lee Ann
2,THIS CD IS NOT THE BIG BAND ALBUM YOU THINK.,I AM A FAN OF RAY ANTHONY SO I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR THIS CD. AS IT TURNS OUT THIS IS NOT A BIG BAND ALBUM BUT A JAZZ ALBUM. THE SONGS LISTED COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT BIG BAND SONGS BUT NOT AS THEY APPEAR HERE.
3,Island Lounge,Arthur Lyman composed and performed some of the smoothest Pacific Island lounge music of the 60's and 70's. He combined jazz with Exotica's appropriation of traditional instruments to create a soft music that is just barely unfamiliar. Music for drinking after a long day at the beach.
5,High quality part with OE sensor,"I purchased this bearing to replace another manufacturer's aftermarket bearing that lasted only 1 year on my trailblazer. The Timken bearing has a Siemens ABS sensor, which is the manufacturer of the original sensor on the vehicle. The bearing that lasted a year had a no-name sensor that failed after only 6 months. You can find a cheaper bearing, but it's not worth having to replace again in a year. Buy the better one and save yourself some work."
4,Timken bearing and hub assembly,These hubs seem to be of very good quality paired with the superior Timken bearings. Installation went very well with no problems. I've had the bearings on for a month and everything is smooth as new. I only listed 4 stars cuz I can't speak for this part's future but I do have high expectations.
2,Could have been better,"I am a big fan of spider movies however this one was boring and unimaginative. Normally I fancy the moveies where there is at least one big spider that will terrorize the town or mountain range or what ever, in this case there was none, and the one guy who you thought might be a freak because his head was covered the whole movie when they finally unmasked him I have seen better makeup in 1950's B movies"
2,"Spiders,spiders,spiders",and more spiders. I love cheese but I do want alittle chips on my nachos. Way too many spiders in this film. If spiders horror movies scare you then this movie is for you. All that said. A group if hikers going through a jungle come across a part of it infested with all kind of spiders. One of the spiders bites a female. The other hikers take her to a village where they find a Dr. who treats her but he has a secret he doesn't want anyone to know about. The hikers have to fight their way out of spider infested caves and a jungle to survive the Dr.s secret. The film has a lot of real spiders but also alot of fake ones. I don't care for spiders myself and was terrified of the as a kid. I still will jump if one crawls on me but this film bored me more than scared me. I want potatos and vegetables with my steak not just steak. All this movie was was spiders and fake web. I'll trade it to someone
1,One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen!,"This movie is horrible. The story is predictable. The acting and dialogue are bad. The CGI and sets are laughable. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. This was a low budget made for TV movie that may not have ever even made it to the small screen. Lance Henrickson has made his share of bad movies, but this one is by far the worst."
3,Nice screen house but does not hold up well,"This screen house is easy to put up and we love that you can drop the sides depending on sun, rain, wind etc. We also like how high it is. However, after one use we had holes in it. Be very careful packing this up because it seems easy to tear."
5,a good screen tent,a good screen tent and the flaps keep the weather out. With the extra tie downs didn't budge in thunderstorms and kept the rain off. With some practice set up and take down is easy. A good product and with Amazon I saved over a hundred bucks and had free shipping!
5,great screen house,"We went camping last week and this works great. Didn't get alot of rain, but we were kept dry. Was very windy one day and there was no breeze inside this. This will also keep you warm if it is cold. We had all the flaps down, except one and made some coffee and the heat from the stove kept us warm. Very easy to put up and take down. Not many parts to this. It is well worth the money."
3,HD disappointment,"We've had the HL-S5086 HDTV for about a week now. We can get two HDTV channels over the air, one is CBS the other public. The public channel looks better, but neither are mind blowing. Our digital Direct TV picture looks absolutely horrible, but, I can get a pretty good picture using standard DVD's over an S-video cable. (they look horrible also if I use the component cables). My wife thinks I should send it back, but I don't think that would be allowed.The over the air, being the only HD signal I get, I have to use that for reference. It's pretty bright, but fast moving images blur and the overall clarity isn't that much better than my 27 inch Toshiba CTR set.I can't speak for other brands of HDTV, but if this is the best it get's it's not worth the money."
1,Very disappointed with Samsung,"I've had this TV since 2006, but since the very beginning it has had reliability issues. There is an issue with a lever in the back of the TV that will randomly shut the TV off. I have bought many TVs in the past, and this has been by far the most aggravating system that I have ever had. Although the picture quality and features is excellent, the uncertainty of it working trumps all."
5,Awsome TV,"Loved the TV and Amazon did an awsome job with delivery service. Very fast and easy set up. Not sure about the other reviewer however I hooked my Xbox 360 up to the TV using component input and it worked great. Just a beautiful picture. Watched the Incredibles, Walk the Line, and The Ringer the very first day we had it and the picture was just amazing. We had looked a few other TVs in about 8 stores when we came across the Samsung DLP tv series AND boy are they great.A+ to Amazon using Eagle shipping. They had it here 3 days after I ordered the TV. 3 Business days ahead of schedual."
3,for the ordinal TV,"I bought this by comparison SONY's. Because other brand's looked darker picture at shop. I am satisfied picture quality when I look at DVD. However this TV has poorer picture expand function for 4:3 pictures to 16:9. Expanding too big to screen with little picture quality control, even chosen smaller expansion, or just horizontal liner looking expansion. I think my previous 7-year-old-Hitachi's has better function. It is quite hard to check this function before buying, because almost all shop displays are used HD or DVD quality source."
3,Not sure,"The TV LOOKS great. Two HDMI ports on something that looks this good, at this price, is superb. But I am having a huge audio/visual delay problem. I have every reason to believe that it is something to do with my cable company's DVR box, but until that is confirmed, the rating remains a 3 of 5. I will update this review if it gets fixed (they have been out twice, and I am waiting on a third time).____________EDIT:It was the DVR apparently, the TV looks great. I still hedge, a bit, because I have yet to hook up surround sound, and I have heard that Samsungs can be pronlematic in this regard. If THAT works, I will give this TV 5 stars. What a picture!"
2,Disposable TV?,"This is a good looking TV with a great picture. However, I think it's long-term quality is suspect. You should know that the bulb (about $120) only lasts about 2 years, so figure this into your buying decision. I've also read a lot of ""fix-it"" sites that claim after a few years, parts start malfunctioning. I've had this TV for about 3+ years, on my second replacement bulb, and now the TV is shutting off randomly. Yay.It's a good TV, but for the price, consider it disposable after a few years."
5,Best TV ever!,"I bought mine right before Christmas and it has been working great! The picture is really clear and smooth. I've been really happy with mine. I have never bought something this expensive on amazon before and I was a little nervous, but the whole process was easy. A company called ""Eagle shipping"" brought the TV to my house, they even took down my old (heavy 36"") TV and set this one up for me to make sure I was satisfied with everything. I did buy the extended warranty (which does start after the manufacture warranty ends). So far, this has been a great TV! What a great deal!"
4,A nice TV for the price.,"So, I had a gift certificate for Amazon, and I wanted a new TV. After some research, I decided to go with this model. It was overwhelmingly postively reviewed, and was only running ~$1150, with free shipping (Feb 2007).Ordered it. It shipped and arrived 3 or 4 days BEFORE the estimated arrival date. A nice surprise. The shipping company called me the morning it was coming and we arranged for them to call me when they were a half hour away from my place.They called later, I drove home to meet them, they were professional and nice. The delivery guy brought the TV inside and unpacked it.TV looks pretty nice (not QUITE as nice as the 1080P TVs I've seen, but then again it's cheaper). Easy to set-up and use. Speakers sound pretty good, but I'm not an audio-phile. No problems with it yet, had it a month so far.Would I recommend someone buy this? Yes, if you don't care that it can't do 1080P."
5,GREAT TV. GREAT PRICE.,Bought this TV when the new 1080 technology was coming out and got it at a real good price. I am very happy with the picture quality and the HD is amazing! 1 week after my purchase the price dropped $100 so I called and received a credit for the difference! HIGHLY RECOMENDED!
3,Serious design flaw for S5086W / S5686W / S6186W,"Got this set home and put it through its paces. Found that component input (R-G-B) input (supposedly highest quality analog in), has serious design issue causing misalignment of the three colors. Problem not evident with lower quality inputs (AV1/AV2/S-Video). Reproduced problem in sets at dealer as well. A test pattern input from component in, will make this issue obvious on vertical borders between red and green bars. Can also be seen by looking at the lettering on the far right of the default opening screen of 'Nemo' DVD, among others. It shows up as a green shadow of the letters to the left of where the letters should be. A very competant tech from Samsung confirmed this design flaw and said he will feed the info back to the factory. Will update this review if/when Samsung addresses the issue and issues a fix."
1,Don't BUY a Samsung TV,I purchased a 50 inch Samsung DLP TV at best buy in 2007 with a 4 year service plan. I had to have the TV fixed 4 times in 4 years. Now that the service plan is expired the TV continues to shut itself off. I have found out that it is most likely a capacitor issue and that Samsung installed capacitors that are too low for the TV and they get hot or burn out. The cost to replace is about $300 and they will still continue to burn out! I decided to junk the TV and buy another brand. Spent about $2500 on this TV 4 years ago and would expect the TV to last more than 4 years. I see from numerous postings on the web that this is a common problem with Samsung TV's. So beware!
1,3 year disposable TV.,"It worked great for 1 year, had excellent picture and was great for sports. Each time I've replaced the lamp, it's the same story, small horizontal black lines start appearing and the TV turns off on its own. Usually 3-4 months after that the lamp goes out. I was told that I would need to buy a lamp every 2-3 years. Unfortuantely, Samsung did not tell me this when I purchased it. Samsung is in a lawsuit because of this TV. Worst. TV. EVER. Paid $1600 three years ago, have gone through 2 lamps."
4,An excellent review of the state of the art in stunt kites.,"This book contains a thorough review of all aspects of stunt kite flying, including construction, materials, theory, flying and application. Absolutely authoratative although it is ""of its time"". Comprehensive plans included for many different types of stunt kite."
5,The one that made them Famous!,"If you only own one Indigo Girls album, it has to be this one. Soulful, dark, enlightening, natural, beautiful, original. What more can I say?"
1,Eh i wouldnt purchase for the price,very flimsy wouldnt recommend buying if you plan to maintain in the same shape. after cutting some cookies blade became dull and didnt work for thick dough
4,pretty good,I got this cd not really expecting much....i was very supprised with it. Jibbs is a very talented artist for his age. Id recommend it....
2,Do your album rank low?,This one should. Most of the tracks on this album are lacking. Jibbs had something with the Chain hang low song but I don't know what happened to the rest of the album. Download the song off i-tunes if you like it and leave the CD at the store. One hitta-quitta right here.
2,Not Very Adjustable,"The stool is not bulky and looks nice in my home. However, I'd prefer a more adjustable chair. For instance, the seat back does not adjust front and back, and the seat bottom does not tilt forward. The lumbar support feels good against my spine, but it deflates every day. The foot support ring diameter is too small that it might as well not exist; it's not a comfortable foot position. The seat bottom is very comfortable, so I'm interested in testing other Tiffany Office Furniture products."
4,good track,I really enjoyed this track&the various mixes added to it.Sade still has a Smooth vibe about Her&Her voice fits in really well with the arrangements here throughout the song.
5,Extremely Clever,"This in an extremely abridged version of Macbeth, with drawings of a production by a family. The Scotish play is, of course, quite dark and tragic, so this fun treatment may offend purists - but I certainly don't mind someone exposing the fun side of performance. The authors do use Shakespeare's actual words, which is more than I can say for some versions for children."
4,very helpful,"I work with wood tool, most of them unplug so sometimes I use a bandsaw, and the dremel was a curiosity, that's the reason why I've boughtit refurbished.And it's ok, I've just used in one ocasion, can be useful for some tipe of working. Also the sander it is not very prrofessional but help to get closed to the finishing part. That's all"
5,my daughter is obsessed with this book,"I bought this book on a whim for my 10 month old daughter. I figured she might like it when she was older. The photos are by Art Wolfe, and I live in Washington state, so I thought it might be nice for her to have a book with photos of the flora and fauna around here. I was hesitant about buying it because honestly I think a lot of the photos aren't Wolfe's best. One or two are a touch blurry, and in general, I just didn't love them.However, I'm glad I bought the book. My daughter immediately must have spent at least an hour flipping through it the day we bought it. She's spent many hours since just looking at the pictures. She really loves turning pages and looking at books for some reason, but this book is by far her favorite. She just really loves it. Perhaps it is the bright photographs.I give this book 5 stars because you can't argue with a child's preference. If you're from the Pacific Northwest, I think it's a very nice addition to a child's library."
4,It's a cable .,"Sony was asking more money for this one .I found cheaper here .not a whole lot ,saved few dollars for mac donalds,Will probably use once a year and will probably last for another couple yeras to come."
2,"Interesting but confusing, flawed and overrated.","The film promises a lot more than it delivers, and it makes the mistake of blending too many genres which sets up a confusing and often pointless narrative. I've seen other filmmakers take this concept to better results. It's not a waste of time, but its nothing to get that excited about either. I thought the performances were just so-so."
4,very good,"i really like this book. i like the layout, i like the exercises and it explains things well. the only reason why i am doing 4 stars instead of 5 is because i dont think it is the end all and be all like the author thinks it is. but it definitely is very good stuff and so she gets 4 stars. thank you Gail!!"
1,disappointing,"The name suggests a lot, but the book was a bit of a disappointment. I think that if these simple exercises really privide the successes they claim, the whole world would be doing them already. Not very accessible either, with the long lists of jobs that you have to match to the exercise."
5,Stars In Camouflage,Best and most original hardcore album ever. Hands down. Definitely worth checking out. No one did it like Tyranny of Shaw.
5,Natalie Portman at her best !,"Ok, I know you may all read this review and think I may be a bit crazy, but in my opinion, this was one of Natalie Portman's best performances I have yet to see.The movie certainly didn't have the press or publicity of Black Swan, but her performance was every bit as good.Try this one out, I think you will enjoy this fine film."
4,Long in content with sketchy ending...ultra-fast delivery,"It's basically a good film, but kind of runs long in certain areas. The ending is confusing, but such is life. Dilivery was like next day...ultra-fast!!!!"
4,Great For a start-up System,"I have owned this system for over a year and have never had a problem with the system nor the speakers. Remote is ok since I already own a RCA TV this remote can turn on or off my TV and do other functions for my TV, can operate a RCA VCR, DVD player.At 650 watts there is enough power to rock the house.So go out and enjoy a movie or some music you can't go wrong with this system."
1,Overload after ten minutes,"Just bought this unit.Ten minutes into use the unit displayed a message ""overload"" on the front led. unit is cooked."
5,artificial tears,It is a great product. My little shih tzu had his eye popped out by a bigger dog and it tore him tear ducts. These drops are perfect to lubricate his eye.
4,Exotic Vibes,"I just recently started enjoying exotica music. I primarily have been focusing on Martin Denny and Les Baxter, but recently i have been branching out with some new artists. One of them being Arthur Lyman. His music is different then Denny and Baxter. It has a smoother more melodic approach and yet it has good rhythms. Although most of the music has a Polynesian feel to it he does mix in a good amount of jazz stylings. I personally have recommended this CD to a couple of friends who are Vibe players because they can learn from Arthur's technique. He is a fantastic musician and even if the style of music is not in your taste, the performance by the gifted musician is well worth the listen."
3,Great exotica album,"Okay, I like Mancini-inspired lounge, Bobby Darin, Nat King Cole, etc. I even have an import CD of the Rat Pack(the best one available on CD). However, I'm not a huge exotica freak. I can take or leave Martin Denny and the bunch. Nevertheless, I was looking for a birthday gift for a friend, who's into tiki, and I came across this CD. Now, again, I've looked for Les Baxter before, but the ""Best of..."" compilation(more lounge than exotica). Arthur Lyman, on the other hand, really merges the two styles of lounge and exotica on this album, one of the original exotica albums of the period. My friend really likes it. It's got a couple so-so pieces, too, but for the most part it's pretty fun. This one's definitely for the lounge lover who secretly likes mai-tais. If exotica isn't your thing, check it out. You may be surprised on this one. My friend has the soundtrack to the film ""2046"" and I knew he'd go for this."
4,simply beautiful music,"Arthur Lyman is undoubtedly one of the best artists of the exotica/cocktail music genre. If you like this kind of music, then you can't miss with this CD."
5,Lyman at The Hawaiian Village Hotel,"I have a confession to make; I may be the only 11-year old who heard Lyman at The Shell Bar(made famous in the ""Hawaiian Eye"" TV series, in which he and his group occasionally appeared). This was back in 1961. I re-met him in late 1999 at the New Otani Hotel near Diamond Head. He was gracious and personable. We talked about the ""Old Days"" in Hawaii; Martin Denny(who was still alive and occasionally played at the Elks next to Duke's Outrigger Club). Then Mr. Lyman played and all those great memories came back. Of his many releases this is a great one to own. I have them all. Great musicianship and terrific sound. His early recordings by Richard Vaughn are still demonstration quality today fifty years later! Myyyy.... has time flown! Enjoy and revisit an earlier and more gentle time.""Aloha!"""
3,Real Exotic Sound,"About 40 years ago, I bought this title of a record.Last year I got two CDs of his music.And now I get the disc titled ""Taboo"".Hearing this music, I remember my young days."
5,Under the Chinook Arch,"A great book! Humorous, adventurous, easy to read and hard to put down. A historical look at what a mid 20th century ranch veterinarian went through to make ends meet. It should be required reading for large animal practicioners, students or anyone who has an interest in ranch vetting."
5,Worth it,"I dont use this blade evey day but it is worth it for the jobs i do use it for, it cuts quickly and smoothly, unlike abrasiveand does not wear out the saw. It is a pretty good blade for the money and cuts nice."
4,a blast from da nineties,"i used to hear it all da time on cassette in those hazy, lazy days in da mid midnineties. Favorite songs were ""beercan""(used to dance ""da funky chicken moonwalk thang @ da Edge in Ft Lauderdale to dis joint) and ""mf"". Except for da played-out fm/alternative hit, Loser, the rest of the album sounded cool (and most would still sound cool to my ears, per my recollection. Remember, back in da cassette days, it was a mission to 'fast forward', so ya never ""skimmed"" and usually heard most of the records released back then."
2,Smooth Bottom Jack Plane,"This english made plane is no better than the $12 Indian made planes. Some of the Indian planes have hardwood handles, the Stanley has plastic handles (which are probably better)which are not estetic. Both planes can be tuned to do a good job on softwood."
4,Review of Everyday Friends by Evelyn Chaves,"This book was a very well written book. To me this book was good, and knowing me I'd tell someone to check it out. I myself like horseback riding. And this book tells about a young girl, named Marcy; and how she learns how to ride by her new friends. I can't tell you any more so... I guess you should read the book by yourself."
3,"accessible, basic","This book focuses on (as stated in the title) teaching *Spanish* although it does include issues regarding translation. The content is fairly basic, and the tone is rather informal. Good for someone with about two semesteres of college level Spanish, or the equivalent. If you're looking to solidify your knowledge of Spanish, and especially learn how it corresponds to English, this would be a good book. If you're looking to learn translation theory you should pick another book."
4,En otras palabras,It was in very good shape with no writing (which I appreciated). The quality was also excellent. It arrive on time as well.
2,Great film! Terrible prints,"I got this as a gift. We were enthralled by the films, but they looked like the people who were supposed to restore them never got done! Instead of scenes leading into one another, many would suddenly stop, like on pause, for a few seconds at the end. Some scenes were really clean, almost as clean as new movies. Others were very grimy. Some had images moving across the screen, in front of the film. One of the extras, an reading by Pagnol, stops midway. We got the receipt from friends and exchanged the Trilogy for a new copy, but it had the same problems! We had to go a minute or two past the stop point to listen to more of Pagnol. I have to agree with that first reviewer below, except that he missed the extra feature problem. Maybe he doesn't listen to it. This is not a finished work!"
4,Humorous and Moving Tale,"Rescued by a female troll, the infant Claye is raised as a troll, learning their language, customs, and way of life. Since this is all he's ever known, Claye (or ""Maggot"" as he is named by the trolls) finds it hard to relate to humans on his first ventures in meeting others of his own kind.This is a humorous and moving tale in the vein of such classics as The Jungle Book and Tarzan. With characterization as the strength of this novel, Finlay has created a fantastic world for this tragic circumstance. Seeing the human world from Maggot's troll mindset, invokes times of humor as well as drama in a realistic way. Well, as realistic as a world where trolls and magic are the norm.I thoroughly enjoyed this debut novel. And I look forward to the next, in which the ending of The Prodigal Troll leaves wide open for a sequel."
2,"A ""set-up"" novel","Charles Coleman Finlay's writing in his first novel is strong and does a great job showing the complexities of his characters, human and troll alike (well, perhaps only one troll). However, I feel that Finlay looks too far ahead toward describing Maggot's future adventures as a troll-reared man dealing with the various corruptions of civilization, instead of focusing on this one story. Although each scene is carefully crafted, the book taken as a whole doesn't have much continuity or momentum. It left me asking myself ""Why do I care?"" after I finished, particularly after the rather abrupt and slightly cliched ending.With that in mind, I still look forward to Finlay's future stories about Maggot because of Finlay's insight and characterizations of places and people. I just rather wish he didn't write this book first."
3,AVERAGE WORK WITH SUB-PAR ENDING,"Raised by trolls a boy comes back to take his place in society, sort of... I'm not going to dwell on this book overly much because it really doesn't deserve the time.As a story goes it had a great deal of potential. Unfortunately the ending pretty much blew any promise it might have had. The ending was choppy, rushed and unfinished; and not consistent at all with the direction of the story up till then. If he wanted a cliffhanger priming the audience for a sequel, he failed. If this was supposed to be the ending of a single volume, he failed miserably.Without asking the author we can't know what his intention was, and frankly I not sure I care. I really don't like stories with poor endings so you'll have to excuse my vehemence.Although I rate the book overall as average I do NOT RECOMMEND it."
1,Not worth the money,"When I received this product, several things where broken including the ramp, so we can't use the ledge. The instructions where very hard to understand, also. It is not as easy to clean as I thought & it leaks all over the place if you don't clean it daily & is not deep enough to keep my walls clean.Not thrilled with this expensive purchase ):"
3,Explosive...Like Diahrea.,12 ultra bad action film guaranteed to make you fall out of your lazy boy from laughter. The Two with Cameron Mitchell are the best because he is so insane but Terror In The Jungle also gets big thumbs up for the most WTF? ending I have ever seen.
2,Not Her Best,I've read many of Gerri Hill's books and this one was for me was not as good as the others (One Summer Night and Deep Cover). Her writing is great but I don't like to read the entire book before getting to a sex scene. Less scenery and more sex would be better for me.
4,Review of Coyote Sky,"I loved the way the author describes the landscape in this book. It made me want to go out to New Mexico even though I hate the heat. The characters were just as wonderful and very real even though some were kind of (in my opinon) hippies, i felt like these were people i would meet in real life. Great book. I'd read it again."
5,Love it.,"I loved the book. So intense, funny, romantic and amazing. I haven't finished the book yet, I have a few chapters left but I'm telling you. It's awesome. The only thing that annoyed me is Brenda's ""Darling"". She says it too much it annoyed me at the beginning but then got used it because that's her character. I just thought that she could have used another word like sweetheart, dear or whatever but I'm over that now and I love the book. It's gonna stay on my shelf.Lee's character is my favorite. The whole weird names like Simone, Sunshine, Harmony and Starlight cracks the hell out of me. It's really funny."
3,THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF BIG BAND CD.,"I HAVE ENJOYED BILLY MAY'S MUSIC OVER THE YEARS. THIS CD AS WELL AS THE OTHER"" BEST OF"" CD ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I EXPECTED. THESE 2 CDS USE BRASS ARRANGEMENTS ONLY. THE MELODIES ARE PLAYED FAIRLY WELL. OUT OF 18 SONGS I LIKED 9."
5,excellent read,this is probably the 3rd time I have read this book and I enjoy it each time. It is strange how it effects my thought process each time as it has been years since I read it the first time
5,Thomas Neal's Bendigo Shafter Review,The book was very good.The characters sounded so lifelike. I thought that it would drag but it didn't.There is no doubt that it is a good book.The book was based on an old western tale.Bendigo Shafter is the main character.It was a good book.
5,As Good As advertise.,"My Athlon 2500 Barton was so hot(sometimes it reached 62C)using original heatsink and fan. Now with Polo 735 the temp is at 47C max (OC to 2.1Ghz). Note that my PC room is very hot 82F. About the noise, I don't know what is noisier, case fans (3) or this fan. As long as my cpu happy and cool, so would I. Free Shipping from Amazon is realy amazing, promise 7 days, I got it in two. Kiss new pc goodbye, I'll stay with this rig for awhile."
4,"Good, sort of...","I reviewed another one of these books I bought at the same time as this one and it basically is the same review. The very most of the sites featured were done in Flash, which looks real good and inspires design ideas, but is very uninteresting for a web designer like me. These books should be called ""Best Flash Portfolios"" it would be more realistic."
1,Just Wrong,"As someone doing web design, I bought this book to look at other designs, and how they were built. If this is what you're looking for, this book isn't for you.This book should be a coffee-table book, but is the wrong size and format even for that. All it contains is pictures of websites, and not at a size to to be considered art. Not helpful. If you want to browse websites, only looking at a picture, you can do that on the web just fine.This book should never have been titled ""Web design"". It's not web design, it's a vanity site on paper."
2,Poor Audio Editing Tracks 12 and 13,"I have many Arthur Lyman albums, first one bought in 1958. I have bought seven Lyman CDs from Rykodisc.This CD, With a Christmas Vibe, has a ""bonus"" track 13 ... but track 12 Silent Night/Joy to the World has nearly two minutes of silence after the music ends, then, viola, there are a few seconds of the beginning of track 13 ... which ends mid phrase then picks up the phrase again when track 13 starts. I also found bad editing in Hey Jude on Rykodisc's Lyman release, Sonic Sixties. I complained to Rykodisc, but they responded with lame excuses, implying there was nothing wrong with the audio editing. I looked at the tracks with an audio editor so I know the tracks are poorly edited.As I am a long-time Arthur Lyman fan, I certainly like the music, but I rate this CD low because of the poor audio track editing."
1,Not cogent explanation,"The spirit of science did not come from religion but from Moslem conduits from Greece and other early cultures. If anything organized religions have done much to suppress science, thought and enlightenment. I do not accept his fundamental story about the root of science."
2,Why only traditional characters?,"Sadly, these are not very helpful for learning modern Chinese because the simplified characters now used in mainland China are not shown on the cards. If they were going to do one but not the other, it would have made far more sense to have only the simplified characters, though mostly I don't understand why they didn't just have both simplified and traditional."
4,Another perspective on the Auca Indian story,"The story of the massacre of five missionaries by the Auca Indians continues--God's plan for this tribe unfolds in this account which draws the reader in to the struggle in the heart of Dayuma, a young Auca woman who comes to Christ. She is used to bring the gospel to her people."
1,NOT WORTH IT!,I bought this because it was the only way that the solar cover was available for shipping. My 2 year old son broke the thermometer the second time he was in the pool. The string and sticky tab that they give you to mount the thermometer held for about a day. We never used the chlorinator because I didn't want that floating in the pool with my children. All and all it was just a waste of money.
2,shipping,shipping cost more than the component it should have cost not much more than envelope by weight but it was alot more.I will not buy from this organization again
4,Fine performance,"A major problem with Amazon's listing of classical videos is that they don't tell you who the performers are. This makes a rational buying decision impossible. You can't even get a large image of the box to tell who it is. So I'm writing this review as a public service since I can recognize the box (similar to the CD) as being the second Marriner recording. It hasSylvia McNair, sopranoAnne Sofie von Otter, mezzoMichael Chance, countertenorJerry Hadley, tenorRobert Lloyd, bass.St. Martin in the Fields Orch and Chorus.Musically, this is a better performance than most. von Otter is particularly fine in ""He was Despised"", and trumpeter Mark Bennett does the best Messiah trumpeting ever recorded, bar none. Many of the choruses are well done, and Chance is good if you like countertenors. Hadley is out of his element. Lloyd and McNair are mid-pack.Can't comment on the video direction since I haven't seen the video yet. But based on the CD I will get it."
3,Close your eyes and enjoy,The audible performance is very good. The quality of the recording is great. The video is dated. Listen don't watch.
2,Jarring Soloists!,The orchestra and chorus are superb as is the video. The ornamentations used by the (especially the female)soloists are in maginal taste and quite often jarring. Buy something else!
3,Adequate,"This book is moderate at best. We used it in a graduate class I am taking as an undergrad. First off, mistakes in the examples and text are not uncommon, and they are very annoying. Second, the examples have too many references to previous examples. It is very annoying to be flipping back 3 chapters to see how an answer was acheived. It is fairly easy to read and the organization is acceptable.Don't get too excited about the software. It may work well, but there is no written or electronic help/support."
5,Useful and comprehensive,This book has described the materials very well. It is really perfect to be a textbook. Good examples and problems.
2,HIM LETDOWN,this is a letdown for him.just go to www.heartagram.com and listen to the sample.it's very weak for such a strong band!
1,"If You Want to be Sin-Free, Boycott HIM with Me","This band is absolute trash! Some of the worst music I've ever heard. I love the CKY videos but Bam should have stuck with just CKY for the soundtracks or better yet have Brandon DiCamillo make up more songs. H.I.M. must stand for Horrible Idiotic Music because it sounds like the worst noise imaginable. Imagine a dump truck backing up at 7am with the ""beep beep beep"" noise topped off with dragging a metal dumpster along the asphalt, just grinding away what's left of your ears and giving you a headache. That's what HIM sounds like.Wake up kiddies and teeny boppers, just because you love Bam Margera doesn't mean you have to love his favorite band too! THINK FOR YOURSELF! This music is HORRIBLE! Notice how Raab, Rake, Bran and the rest of the crew never sport HIM attire? Can you actually call yourself a fan after watching what a tool the lead singer is? He looks like more of a flamer than Siegfried & Roy, only not as tan. Excuse me while I go puke..."
1,Sometimes change is a BAD thing,"I don't know why Nexxus decided to mess with the best conditioner on the market, but this product is ruined. I had used this conditioner for the past 17 years, but never again. The consistency is completely different and the strong smell is so disgusting that it made me sick to my stomach. I let my daughter try it and she said it made her want to gag. How do these horrible products get past quality control? If I could give it zero stars, I would.Can anyone posting a future review suggest a decent alternative? Thanks in advance!"
1,"Original is better, new formula is horrible","I am a guy. I have long hair. I used this product my entire life and I appreciated the very mild scent and how well it worked with my hair.The NEW formula has a VERY intense scent and doesn't work nearly as well at conditioning.Dear Nexxus, please change back to the original formula!"
2,"Somewhat conditioning, but leaves hair coated","I tried Humectress for a week as a rinse-out conditioner. After my hair would dry, it felt coated. Not oily, but like there was some other coating on the hairs. I don't quite know how to describe it. If I ran my hand over it, it would come away with a a coating which didn't rub off. It came off with soap. Very strange.Otherwise it was a so-so conditioner. I have coarse, super dry, curly hair. It didn't dry my hair out any more than it already is, but it didn't add moisture either. I had a lot of frizzies while using it."
5,This is the Best!,"I am very lucky to finally find this again.Nexxus has apparently discontinued this product, (much to mydismay) It is the ONLY thing that really really works on and inmy fine thin hair."
5,Love for My Hair,"My hair is fine and I lighten it and also perm it 4 times yearly. This leaves it dry and when it is dry, it is frizzy. Using this conditioner, either after shampooing or on dry hair, helps restore the moisture and let my hair curl instead of frizz. I also use a curl restoring lotionwith it and the combination does very good. I keep it on hand all the time."
3,You have to use Humectress shampoo with this,"When I used this conditioner with other shampoo, it didn't work. My hair felt like I did not use any conditioner at all. I tried it with other conditioner mixed together, but still it didn't do much. I almost threw it away when it was still half full. Then I tried its companion shampoo: Humectress Shampoo. Then I understood why this conditioner is so light. The shampoo is very rich. If you have normal to oily hair, this shampoo will feel too rich and oily. They both work together, but ironically the conditioner is more expensive. I wouldn't repurchase its conditioner. There are better ones out there with much better prices. My favorite is Herbal Essence Color Me Happy. I have color treated hair and use flat iron everyday. So I would keep using Humectress Shampoo, but not with this conditioner. I'm giving it 3 stars because with the shampoo it works ok. Otherwise I would have given it 1 star."
2,loved the old formula. this one - not so much.,"I've been using humectress for years on very long hair. I used a little as a leave in conditioner on the ends as well. This re-formulation of humectress is a miss for me. My hair is not as shiny and smooth as before, and by the end of the day, the ends feel brittle. I'm not thrilled by the fragrance choice either. I can't say the conditioner was horrible, but it no longer does what it used to do, and i'm going to have to look around for a new product."
1,Worst Salon Product Ever!,"I bought this conditioner at Costco (in a giant bottle) and tried it two times in the past two days. The first time my hair dried and looked greasy like I hadn't washed it at all, so I washed it again the next day and used the conditioner again. Even worse this time! My hair is very fine and straight but this just made it look matted and dirty even after extensive rinsing. I had to wash my hair with vinegar after the second application to get the greasiness out then followed with my old shampoo/conditioner (herbal essences). Stay away if you want your hair to look clean!"
1,SHADE GARDEN DISASTER,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT. SOFT COVERED CHEAP AND SMALL.EVEN WORSE; IT'S LIKE READING WAR AND PEACE.NO PICTURES THAT MAKE ALL GARDEN BOOKS A GREAT PICK AND GIVE IDEAS; IN COLOR.HORRIBLE
4,Great for a tree covered yard,"I purchased this book because most of my property is covered with mature trees, and I had a very hard time getting anything to grow. While building a patio/garden, this book proved invaluable many times. I bought it several years ago and still use it every Spring!"
5,A Bible for Flower Gardeners Challenged by Shade,"Thinking I needed full sun to grow any plants and flowers, I was prepared to cut down trees and clear land. But finding this book in the library stopped me in my tracks. I renewed it three times because I didn't want to give it back. Finally I came here for my own copy. There are incredibly beautiful flowers that grow in partial and full shade. I would've never known that without this excellent book."
3,Not my fave of the series,"Loved The Hunger and The Companion. This is similar to Companion I thought with the male vamp suffering from xtreme guilt and the virginal young human girl that understands. But this one overdid the flashback sex far too much. I actually skipped over parts of chapters because it was repetitive. But the storyline was pretty good like the above mentioned books. I enjoyed it but compared to the others...not as much. It is the story of Stephen though, so if you have read The Hunger, you will want to read this."
1,Borrrrrinnnggg..........,"I always try to be right there when Susan's books come out but with this one I wished I had been busy that day. I skimmed/skipped vast sections of the book just to get to the end. It was extremely wordy and the erotic parts weren't, well.......erotic. Sexual torture like that isn't very erotic. I never did quite get the whole sister's thing at the end. Must have been in one of the parts that I skimmed/skpped over. Susan, go back and use that red editing pencil on this one."
2,Kinky!,"This book went beyond erotic. It was sick! After reading the other books, I wanted to finish it up with Stephan's story. He did not seem to feel so guilty in The Hunger. However, in this book, he seemed weak. Susan Squires has some sick fantasies. I do not consider rape erotic in the least. Raping someone does not make them a warrior. Our heroine Ann Van Helsing is psychic. Just one touch with Stephan and she sees his past. She sees the Daughters committing horrible sexual acts. She sees his love for Beatrix. She sees the cruelty of Asharti. Ann even realizes that he is a vampire. What is really lame is that she accepts it as someone just told her that they had a cold. Ann for being so alone and isolated seemed up on her sexual techniques and even sociable. How does she know so much about the town since she does not mingle with the people? I really thought this book was dumb. It needed more character development and oh yeah, a plot!"
2,Stephan Sincai,"Very disturbing --on serveral counts. i had high hopes for Stephan flash back for someone 2000 years old of his life,relationships with other women in his life and most of all understanding his feelings towards Beatrix. i had a hard time following the story line due to the sexual exotic scenes with him and the Daughters. i really did not understand the purpose of it all in holding himself in. i love Stephan and my heart went out to him because there was so much guilt within himself, feeling bad about Asharti and mostly the fact that Beatrix left him. i wanted to cried through it all because i guess the love i wanted for him he could not have and if if he express his love towards Beatrix his idealist ideas held him back."
2,You Can Rape The Willing,"Very disturbing book--on several counts. The flash backs in her other books orovided insight into the characters--how Beatrix had almost reached the point of no return, how Ian became a vampire, and why the poor guy needed counseling. All the flashbacks in this book provided was the fact that Stephan is a ""bottom"" without enough preservation to have a stopping point. I liked Ann, and I liked Stephan--in spite of the fact that he's an idiot. I wish Squires had spent more time on why someone who has lived for over 2000 years is too self-destructive to realize the so-called good guys are doing a head game on him. Ann figured it out and she's been in an isolated area for 25 years. I also wanted more on Stephan's past--she dropped just enough hints to be annoying. On the whole, I thought two potentially good characters were wasted on nasty, destructive rape scenes."
4,Thoroughly Entertaining,"Stephen was trying to right wrongs that he felt responsible for and was willing to do whatever it would take to find redemtion. Ann was cursed with the sight from touch, who made the ultimate sacrafice for love. This was not your average romance story but it does keep you on the edge.I was thoroughly entertained and I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book. I actually read it in one day. There were some dark parts that not everyone will like, and the author has a differnt take on the vampire genre which was refreshing. This was the first book of Susan Squires that I read and it will definitely not be my last."
1,What a disappointment!,"I have read many (too many) historical romances in my time, and I very much enjoy a well written ""sex"" scene. I actually threw this book down in disgust, about 100 pages before the end, because I knew EXACTLY what was coming next: a repeat of the same tired old sex scenes for the sake of more sex scenes.No decent plot, not one iota of believable storyline...I threw this book in the trash can...and it was new."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is the second book I've read by Susan Squires and it will be the last. There was little or no romance in the novel. I felt nauseated after I read this novel because there was an over-emphasis on S/M behaviors and less on the storyline between the main characters. If you like vampire romance, read Christine Feehan. She rocks!"
1,Not what I consider romance,"Though I have been rather interested in vampire romances recently, this one I found more disturbing rather than exciting. The majority of the book was not about romance but instead was graphically violent, not only in actual fight scenes, but in the vividly described S&M; scenes with the three women vampires. And there is plenty of sex in the book, but instead of being a wonderful thing to be enjoyed, it's brutal and painful.The main male character is confusing as he is supposed to be so powerful and yet he seems wishy-washy to me in too many places. He can't make a decision and can't stand up for himself. Physically strong, mentally weak.The main female character is not much better, though I actually liked her a little more than the male lead.All in all, I wouldn't read this again and would not read any others in the series as this author seems to have a love/hate relationship with sex and little sense of romance."
2,"Not great quality, not great","I wouldn't buy these again. One was brand new in package but faded completely and shrunk after the first wash (using regular HE washing detergent in normal dryer temp)...second was repackaged and what I would consider damaged/defective, flaw in the fabric making one side seem a different color than the other (obviously a defective customer return Amazon did not catch), faded and shrunk the same as the first. Basically, crap."
4,so far so good,"We paid about $8 for this sheet, and it's a nice quality fabric. Much higher quality and by far more cozy than the $5 Circo ones we got from Target. This may be a little warm during the summer, we're going to give our daughter another day on this sheet before we pack it up and wait for cooler weather reaches us."
4,a bargain,Four classic films starring Edward G Robinson. Good quality prints and thus a bargain for the classic gangster film aficionado.
5,Excellent,"This book has wonderful diversity. Please note, this book is not for beginners. Excellent book - wonderful for discussions."
4,Too different from the 7th edition,"Pluses:- 38 pages long SPN-ENG dictionary at the end;- interesting material;- easy to study;- lightweight.Minus:- lots of differences from the newer edition (9th) we use in the class. Cannot use for the class, but would love to study it later on my own."
2,Find a used one,"This plane really is terrible. Plastic handles, poor machining. It feels cheap. For the money one should have little problem finding an older, nicer #4 elsewhere. That's what I did. Shortly after getting this plane and truing it up, I was disgusted by the amount of time I put into it for something so cheaply made. So I bought a nice vintage model Stanley Bailey online and it is fantastic."
2,Ain't what they used to be,"I have a real problem with the overall machining on this. The sides and bottom are very roughly machined. The sole is so far from being flat - I have spent a couple hours lapping the bottom and I still haven't gotten to the lowest depressions. This makes me wonder if the sole will be 90 degrees to the sides when I'm done. Stanley seems to be trying to compete with the (junky)l ow-price Chinese and Indian planes, rather than be a mid-price alternative to the $250+ Lie-Nielsens and Veritas. I would have preferred to pay in the $80-100 range for a decent plane than $40 for this beast. I've since gotten a few old Stanley planes at the internet auction site, and they have been of much better quality and needed less tuning than this. And that's all I have to say about that."
3,It's the blade,"After useing both cheaper (great neck) and more expensive (lie-nielsen) planes; I can honestly say the biggest indicator of how well any plane will preform is the blade. I've been able to produce equally good (and bad) results from all three planes. But if forced to make a choice as to prefernce, I have to go with stanley.The Great Neck Plane handels are just a bit too ackward to use for any extended period of time and the chip breaker is a bit fidgety. The Li-Nielsen is good, and the frog is easier to adjust, but those benefits don't out weigh the price difference and the blades are too thick. They take too long to sharpen. The Stanley is just a straight down the line winner. Is it perfect?-no. You will need to do some work (I had to lap the back of my chip breaker to get it to fit tight against the blade), but when quality is placed against price, it's not a bad choice."
2,flat? I don't think so,After 6 hours of work and 20 sheets of wet/dry sandpaper I am still trying to get the sole flat n smooth. The initial grindingis so rough u could use it as a rasp. It may be a fine tool (I havent used it yet) but it takes a lot of hand lapping to get it ready
1,Just don't,If you want to by a poor excuse of a plane like I did then help yourself. You'll be sorry and don't say you haven't been warned!!
4,Nice bra,Fast delivery. I am happy with this purchase. The bra fits well and is pretty comfortable. The straps don't slide which is a plus for me. Washes well also.
3,"Wonderful support, but very thin","This is a great bra to minimize, lift, and support. However, the fabric is incredibly thin. If this bra could be made in a thicker and more comfortable fabric, it would be the last bra I ever purchased. The underwire rubs very slightly under the arms, as well but, coming from a 38 DD, what this bra does us awesome. But I will not buy it again until it comes in a heavier, more comfortable fabric."
4,A Really Good Buy,"This Bali underwire is well made and gives excellent support. However, I have the same concerns as voiced by others. The underwire protrudes noticeably in front. It remains to be seen whether bending them inward will remain effective-but so far so good.The vast majority of bras today use spandex in their cups, and for me they are totally useless. Gone are the ancient all cotton bras that used to breathe. Surely modern technology can to consider the positive aspects of those bras.A really serious drawback for me is the lack of padding around the underwire. While the bra fits me really well that wire can be somewhat annoying. However, since I haven't had such quality and ""support"" in years, I'm going to stay with this model. It most certainly works as advertised AND the pricing is excellent."
2,Poking wires,"This is a comfortable bra, but the wires were sticking up from between the cups. If they could make this without wires and still the have the support I would have kept it."
3,pretty but,I've been wearing a couple of bras that has no underwire and gives great support and is amazingly comfortable. So I'm afraid I've gotten spoiled. This bra fits just fine but it's going to take getting use to an underwire again. It 's very pretty. and the fit ts true to size.
3,So good,Very supportive and very nicely priced. It is very hard to find bras of that size at a decent price so I like that it is under $30.
5,Bra,"Bra was exactly as described, really comfortable, lots of support without feeling like lots of support."
2,Bali bra,Loved the bra but the fit wasn't good at all. It definately ran small. Had to return it. Will definately look at other Bali products.
3,Bali Women's Satin Tracings Minimizer Underwire Bra,"Everything was good when it arrived. The only disappointment is that the elastic on the back started to stretch out quickly. Within a month I was having to move the hooks over to the second setting and by the third month, I had to move the hooks to the last setting. I expected it to last longer. I wonder if it had been stored a long time and the elastic was old. It appeared perfect in the beginning. It won't last long at this rate."
5,excellent bra,"Very good quality. it really holds well, and does a great job at minimizing. And I already own three diff. colors.I highly recommend it..."
5,excellent product as described at a competetive price.,my wife ordered 2 of this product and by mistake ordered a wrong size on one of them. amazon gave a RMA immediately and got credit for the item returned. she seems to be very happy with the product and a lowest price she ever paid for this product.
4,Almost perfect,"This is a great minimizer. It lifts and keeps you lifted, so none of that constant adjusting. It has great side support, wide cushioned straps to ease shoulder strain and looks very smooth under your clothes. The fact that it's pretty doesn't hurt either. The only small issue I have with this bra is that the straps, though tolerable, seem just a little short even when adjusted to their maximum length. All in all, this is one of my favorite's and I'll be buying more."
4,Had to remove the underwires,It fits very well and is basically comfortable with good support. I had to remove the underwires as they did not fit well. I only give it 4 stars because I feel the weight of the straps more once the underwires were out.
4,foundation garment,This was a great purchase. Excellent value for money. I'm a lactating mom returning to work and needed extra support. This bra offered excellent support while minimizing my bust line by about an inch. I love it.
2,Underwire in the center of the bra sticks out!,"Not happy. The bra is nice enough, but the underwire comes up too high or something - it sticks out and shows when I put clothing on - any kind, t-shirt, dress blouse, whatever! And I bought this to wear with clothing! :-/ Bought 2, 2 are going back. I'll watch for this ""high center"" on any other bras I purchase, though I have had no problem with it in the past. Perhaps my increased cup size has something to do with this (went from C to D) though I highly doubt it."
3,Does not minimize,Plus's1) Very comfortable straps2) Good back support with 4 hooks3) good cleavage coverage- no spillsNegative1) Does NOT minimize2) Very very pointy shape - looks artificial and actually makes them look larger and bigger- the exact OPPOSITE of what is intended with a minimizer bra
3,Bali satin Tracings bra,"This is a great Minimizer, it runs somewhat small, I use a bra extender, the next size is too big. also the bra-straps should be longer. With all of this i still wear only this bra."
3,well....,Triple D is too small so I tried G...and still my girls are trying to escape....I hate that. I bought the Goddess plunge in the same size and it fits great. This is a quality product...just wish sizes were universal
3,"Great bra, but one major problem","It shows through all my clothes!:(I've tried dozens of minimizer bras over the years and I would rank Bali's Satin Tracings among the top for comfort, fit, support, and minimizing ability. I love the padded straps that stay in place all day.The reason I can only give 3 stars for such a great bra is that is shows through everything! The hideous seams that run diagonally across the cup show through all my clothes - even my thickest sweater! I'm disappointed that I can only wear my most supportive bra around the house so nobody will see it..."
3,"good support, too bad it mishapes you",prosvery comfortable strapsgreat supportconsinstead of laying flat to my skin the wires stick out between the boobs giving this weird bump on any shirt that i wear.can only wear around the house because of how it deforms my clothesupdate: some people recommended that i bend the wires inward so i wouldnt have these two wires pointing out between my boobs. so i put it on again this morning and did just that...duh...why didnt i think of that.the wires arent lying flat and if i bend the wire too much then they just bubble out further down but i was able to make it good enough that i dont look deformed. im very happy for the advice and now i can wear this to work and feel supported all day. for that im giving it another star. im waiting to see how it hold up in the wash...thanks for the advice....
2,Itchy stitching,The minimizing part works great. I found the stitching to still be itchy after 3 washes.
5,Love this Bali bra,I have worn this style Bali minimizer bra for years. It provides adequate support for us bustier women and being a minimizer it helps keep my blouses from gapping.
2,Very 1950's Profile!,"Although this is a well constructed (heavy duty) bra, the profile this bra creates is very retro. The seaming across the center of the breast creates a very pointy look. Not the smoother rounder look that is popular today. It also needs to be hand washed because of the seaming which tends to shrink and pucker after washing. I would not recommend this bra."
4,A good solid bra for big boobed women,Nice padded straps. Fits me well and gives satisfactory support. Central wire is inclined to poke out . Maybe I need to loose a bit. The worst fault is the meaness of the length of the straps. When ever I receive new bras[and I have ordered these bras 3 times now] I have to unpick and lengthen the straps. Big chested women simply need longer straps. I have seen this comment for this bra before. When will they learn. I'd give them 5 stars if it were not for the straps
5,BEST BRA MADE FOR G CUP GALS,What a great bra! I almost never can get a bra that is comfortable with my size 40G. Most of the time I cannot wait to remove mine but I purchased these and they are the best. They really do minimize! and they really hold up me up! I ended up throwing up all of my other bras & I almost never take this one off. It runs very true to size! Buy it & you won't regret it.
2,Not a good fit,Disappointed with this bra. The fit is not good and the underwire digs into my rib cage which I've neve experienced before. It could be that this bra is just not suitable for my body type.
5,Based on the life Friedreich Nietzsche,"Set in 1882, Zarathustra is a novel by Walter Stewart based on the life Friedreich Nietzsche, a philosopher who was on the brink of ultimate insight into the human spirit when he fell in love with the provocative and enthusiastic young woman Lou von Salome. Zarathustra is a deeply romantic novel of love at cross-purposes, sudden betrayal, and the lasting impressions of the human heart on one man whose philosophy would influence and affect the 20th Century."
5,A definite surprise,I thought this would be the typical cheesy grade D movie - it was actually quite good and have loaned it to two friends who plan on buying it!
2,I really disliked it,"I just finished ""winter garden"" a few weeks back and was thrilled to find out a new Ashworth book was coming out, but this was not what I was expecting. The entire jaw bone plot was really silly, as other reviewers mentioned it made no sense that Ned would be disgraced by someone stealing the jaw, nor did it make any sense the *revenge* Ned intended. And for me, this plot was boring as sin. What was the urgency? It wasn't like Ned was a spy or a ambassador, we all have our personal career setbacks but the book made it like it was a devistating loss on par with losing a limb.Then I found the romance dull and lifeless as well. I could see little reason for the pair to fall in love. I didn't even make it to the last chapter which, I was shocked to discover, I wasn't too disappointed about. I hate to give a bad review, but this one really should be skipped."
3,Not what I expected!,"I was so thrilled to get this book and so disappointed when I read it. I think that Adele Ashworth's prior books are some of the finest examples of historical romance, and this book just isn't up to par with them. I found the plot to be tedious and slow while the secondary characters were colorless and uninteresting. The bright spot to this book was the romance between Mimi and Nathan. I loved the way Mimi went after what she wanted so honestly, but it wasn't enough to make me stop yearning for the Adele Ashworth of old."
2,So disappointed...,"with this book ! I have loved Adele Ashworth's previous books, and looked forward to this one. The characters were unsympathetic and I guessed the ending by Chapter Two. I wanted to tell both characters to ""get over it."" But, at least they ended up with each other, and they deserved no more. Sorry, Ms. Ashworth - this one was a waste of my time."
3,Seaching for Gold,"The compelling aspect of the book is the way strangers recount the essence of their lives in the space of several pages. What they have done, seen, felt and thought and how it all shapes their views on death and the possibility of afterlife. Some of the stories are inspiring, tragic or deeply moving. Some are mundane. All are authentic. The nature of the book is that the author makes no assessments, offers no opinion and provides no comprehensive or intergrating perspective. Like a miner sifting through tons of ore for a few nuggests, the reader goes through 60 interviews and in the end must decide if the rewards were worth the effort. An apt parable for life itself."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this 5'5"" ugly stick lite to use for trout fishing. I had read several reviews and I thought that it would be a good match for my Pflueger President. When I got the rod I expected the two pieces to be about the same length instead one was about 3 feet long while the other was about 2 feet long. The rod was also very front heavy. I have two of these rods in heavier versions and I like them and use them a lot having caught bass, drum, catfish, hybrids, carp, and musky on them. When I shook the rod to see how it felt I noticed a slight sound, this turned out to be one of the eyelets which was already loose. This rod does however have a five year warranty, and I liked the sensitivity of it better than other ugly sticks. The rod seemed very durable like other ugly sticks other than the guides."
2,"Descent, but get the 5.5 ft","I had the 5.5 foot slightly heavier version of this rod but a friend lost it in the lake. I replaced it with this rod and it went from my my favorite ultralight to a rod I don't rally like to use. I have the same 420 penn on it, but the reel also isn't as smooth feeling. Definitely stick with the 5.5 foot lite if you can find it.Updated: Have used this rod and a 6 ft version both for about the past 3 months and the inside of the last eye has fallen off on both. May be my last ugly stiks. Have 4 currently and have owned several more, but the quality seems to have gone down."
4,"Simply ""one of the best text book"" on Data structure!!",The style of writing is easy to understand. Recursion and Sorting chapters are excellent. Should include more detail about double linked list. Should explain more in detail about bindary tree class implimentation.
1,It is not worth the price,"After spent hours of reading this book, I can only gain a little bit from it and makes me more confused and frustrated about programming."
1,This book is unworthy of even the one star,We used this book for a data structures class and the teacher tought directly out of this book. When trying to complete programs it is hard to use the sample code because it is mostly in pseudocode. The code that is there is all ADTs and is not explained very well at all. I know that there has to be better books that this junk to cover the subject matter.
1,TOTAL MONEY WASTER!,"This book is only worth it if you already know Data Structures/Data Abstraction. You should only buy if you have been doing this for years and want to refresh your mind. But even so, the examples are poor and vague. There is no consistency, it goes from clear to a blury mess. this is the type of book that even after reading 50 times you still won't get the descriptions unless you buy 10 other books or you have previous experience in the field."
2,"no complete code inside, messy descriptions","Before you read this book, I suggest that you have at least 2 years experiences on C++. Otherwise you will suffer from this book."
1,Poor explanations/examples. I implore: Don't even bother!,"It all starts clearly, but as you start reading the second chapter, the book becomes very vague and offers only unclear examples and unexplained deductions. The examples are just not descriptive enough. It's like reading a calculus book but with more wordiness and less precise description. The books lacks of pace and balance; it goes from clear to total blur from one sentence to the other.You won't be doing yourself a favor with this one."
5,Good down to earth data structures,"If you want to learn data structures, this book has lots of good information. In fact, my university uses this book for its data structures class. This book also uses c++ but no STL. It would be nice to have STL since we want the code to be reusable for any objects."
1,"too wordy, not concise","This book repeats the same thing again and again, not so concise. I have the feeling of wasting my time when I read this book. no any pace....After you spend several hours, you are still outside of topic.Good book should save our time, not waste our time"
1,poor content,50% is murmur.You can spend the money to buy other better book.Don't waste money on this.
3,Just Okay,"I guess I'm the lone dissenter here, and that's okay.This book was just okay for me. It was a sweet read and the characters were realistic. But when I read these books, I look for a plot that stands out. I look for something that hits me with some kind of emotion, whether it be humor or tragedy. Harlequin comes out with too many books for me to want to bother reading something that was just okay.It's not a book that I'm going to go back and read a second time, and I guess I use that as my measuring stick. Does this book stand out enough for me to want to keep it for months and reread it at a later date? Is it good enough that I would recommend that my friends purchase it? In both cases, the answer is unfortunately no.Three stars for a cute heroine and a hero with human faults and uncertainties. Also, even though I'm sick and tired of amnesia plots, this one was written in a way that made it bearable."
4,good read,great story of strong woman. Local history is interesting. Well written. A good read for anyone.
2,Looks good during the day but flickering light when it's on,"This design doesn't work, when it's dark, the light comes on automatically. However, the Pooh cover reflects the bulb light back to the sensor and the light flickers. The night-light works perfectly without the Pooh cover. The design is defective. It only looks good."
2,Pooh Night Light Not So Great!,Our Pooh Night Light flickers and is very tempermental. Most times it comes on even when its still light out and when it does it flickers so much that my toddler asked for me to get rid of it.
1,Mine doesn't even work,"This is a super cute nightlight, and it worked just fine til one day I needed to unplug it for some reason...I plugged it back in...and it hasn't worked since. I tried replacing the bulb...and nada. It's cute, but that's about it."
2,Skip this one,"Rex Stout is a prolific mystery writer and is quite popular. I read one of his books some time ago and decided to read another one. I chose Final Deduction. Maybe just a bad choice, but I found his famous dectective, Nero Wolfe, to be a rude, arrogant jerk. The story itself is routine, if not boring, centering around a dysfunctional rich New York family. Who cares? I am sure there are better choices among the Nero Wolfe series and certainly there are better mystery writers."
3,review of final deduction,we have a website at orbitcostarica and our friend has to bring books when he visits from boston to us in costa rica since it is hard to get items from the statesthis one did not live up to the standards of wolfe and archie seemed to be more like a short story and it was obvious the wife did the dirty deed from the startrather disappointed but we now have all the series so it is a collectors item for us
1,DO NOT BUY or USE THIS BOOK,"This book was absolutely useless. I used this book in 1999/2000 and found the majority of the information contained in this book to be inaccurate or very outdated. I encountered numerous situations where services, i.e. trains, buses, hotels and museums had closed down or not existed for up to 10 years in the past! The 2nd addition did not update any of even the most basic of information. After countless experiences of ""wrong advise/info"" I tossed the book. Please bear in mind that I lived in Mexico for one year and traveled extensively during this time with my Mexican wife. Buy any other book but this one! You have been warned."
1,useless,"Utterly useless! I found myself in mexico with this waste of space. Luckily after only two weeks I found the Lonely Planet book.Buy it if you need something to keep a door open, or rest you foot on, but that's all.Some important towns are not listed, hotel and restaurant listings are brief and often prices are not included. Do yourself a favour and buy the Excellent Lonely planet guide to mexico."
5,Liz does it again,My group loved the Bad Girls prequel...and so of course we wanted this study too. The workbook asks such meaninful questions and the DVD is so entertaining as well as inspirational. Every woman should see them both.
5,Really Bad Girls of the Bible,My order was processed quickly and received ahead of time. The book was clean and without signs of wear. Thank you.
5,great book!!!,i'm belong to a society called the SCA ... who recreate medieval history and my mom bought me this book so i would start to make my own garb....let me tell you...it worked so well! i would recommend this book to anyone who loves to sew.
3,Livre interessant,"Alors voilà, ce livre est pas mal, les patrons sont de bonne qualité mais comme l'auteur le dit, c'est son interprétation des choses.Je trouve qu'il manque un peu de source bibliographique pour les médievistes pure et dur.Donc ce livre est un bon point de départ pour qui veux commencer mais pour les plus avancer, il y a des modification à faire au patron pour avoir qqch de parfait (enfin si ce mot existe).Bonne lectureSyS"
3,could be improved,"The made-in-Taiwan Electroluminescent Night Light by Intermatic Co. just went dead after 20 years of 24x7 service. This 2-pk light made by GE CHIN> is used for replacement (> is for the falling A as in the book titled Poorly Made in CHIN> by Paul Midler). Will see how it will last.In appearance, the illumination area is small, 1 3/8 by 1 1/8, thus gives less light than the old 2"" well balanced circle. The illuminated greenish blue is pleasant. The nice thing about the light is that it stays flat against the wall outlet without protruding out or taking much space.The construction appears to have 2 plastic plates pressed together with the luminescent sheet sandwiched in between. The gap between the plates is uneven and not sealed well. The plates on the old light had gap in between, evenly spaced, but couldn't separate no matter how hard to pry. They must have been molded together solid in one piece. Too much for the good old day <sigh>."
2,Overrated.,"Parts of this series was interesting, but there were a lot of letdowns...Kevin has several rather sexist attitudes; Winnie really is rather insipid in that she whines too much and has only Kevin, Paul, and his guys friends as her only friends. The one year she's at a different school, she comes back to Kevin wailing that she ""doesn't fit in"" and how lonely she is instead of attempting to make some friends on her own (she does wind up hanging out with another group of all guys from that school). The only characters I really liked here and sometimes it was the reason I watched this series occasionally were Paul and Debbie Pfieffer. There were both so cute and funny! They were basically the only two intelligent, enjoyable characters there and I loved their dark hair, eyes, and thick glasses. I liked how gentle and loyal Paul was."
1,Dissapointed,"This stethescope was advertised as new. It was not. It was a used stethescope in an unwrapped box with no extra ear peices or other paraphnelia that comes with a new stethescope. I will buy one in the store. That way I won't be affected by ""false advertisment."" This item is definetely being returned."
5,A step-by-step approach that works!,"Built on research and loaded with examples of how it works, this approach led us through the re-visioning process at Good Shepherd parish here in State College PA -- right to a ""pastoral Plan"" for our parish. Having a framework we could all understand, and the steps to follow are invaluable when working with volunteers with so many other demands on their time.A word of caution: get ready for change! Not everyone will want to. Mary Ann's process will take you to new places."
2,Not for the motorcycle owner,This is a book that tries to do too much and as a result doesn't do any one thing really well. When you distill all the good stuff down it would be better as a magazine article. I returned the book the first day.
1,AWFUL BOOK,"I was hoping for some true insight into how and why you would want to cruise long distance on a motorcycle. Instead all it was a regurgitated collection of basic hints and tips about motorcycling in general that is available in even your basic owners manual. With topics such as ""How to buy the right bike, and why it's important to check the oil."" it was very apparent to me that Mr. Stermer was more interested in royalty checks, then shedding any light on this aspect of riding.Can you tell I didn't like it, and want to send it back."
2,"Old dog, old tricks - new dog new tricks",This book is a good reference book for those just getting interested or just starting out in motorcycling. Most information contained in the book can be obtained through reading and forums on the web.Unless you know nothing of the motorcycleing world this would be good to read. Otherwise give it a miss.
5,Excellent investment,"I bought this book before taking a 2,600 mile two week tour of seven western states on my SV650. I have owned 8 motorcycles, the first in 1973, so I thought I knew a lot. It was a very good book with lots of advice that saved me the purchase price many times over. It is a small investment that pays excellent dividends if you are planning a trip, unless you have a great deal of touring experience. I also reccomend it if you are considering a bike but don't know what you want."
5,urban scrawl never looked as good as this.,"This book is the bomb. It illustrates the badly misinterpeted subculture of street graphics, in a light that would make a welcome addition to anyones sense of fresh design. This hard-to-put-down read is always on my desk when I need inspiration."
3,Memory Lane,"I found this book to be very helpful in developing skills to remember and organize impressions left by places, facts, numbers and much more. If you're looking for a way to increase your ability to retain information this is your book."
2,"Episodic rambling, thinly veiled real world references","Rather than building a world, he throws a thin veil over this one and uses it to explore various episodes that in the end lead no where. The character isn't likable and the issues of the world don't drive the story either so what's the point? I don't believe the hero's friends would have saved the main character. There was no good reason to do so and no driving relationship to explain it either. Some fun detail in the fighting but that's not enough to support a story. Move along, better fare to be read other places."
1,There are good books and then this is this book,"I am still stunned I wasted my money on this one. It's obvious the person that wrote it knows nothing about weapons usage or Martial Arts. This is some of the worst reading I have ever MADE myself do. From what I understand, this was the authors first book. I hope he didn't quit his day job"
2,"Let us Have Music for Piano, Volume II","I received this and was disappointed that this is Volume II of the series.Amazon, please fix your listing. Now I have two Volume II's and none of the first volume that I thought I had ordered!"
3,Great illustrations of the inside of plants; Text boring,"Models demonstrate the inner workings of plants and are very detailed. We also see small high-quality photographs, such as sequences of insect-eating plants catching and containing their prey.I tried using this as a first introduction to seeds, germination, and plants in general but found the text skipped around too much for proper understanding. Additionally, due to the layout design, it was hard to tell which block of text went to which illustration, and in what order they should be read. The text is boring. It seems that the author or the publisher's goal was to include every plant term and to define it. The level of terminology in the book is at a high school level, although it is all SO boring! What a shame!I am rating this book with 3 stars, as an average; the text deserves a 1 star rating and the illustrations deserve a 5."
3,not shure,well im not shure if this is the book i red back in 76 but if it was it was interesting i got it from a book mobile the ist time i think i ever used one in plymouth mass ...
4,Tasty Vegetarian dishes,"Have you ever wondered how people from around the world prepare vegetarian dishes. Then this book is for you. The author collected over 130 recipes from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. None of the recipes ask for an excessive amount of different ingredients and everything can be found in local food stores. Preparation times are mostly kept under 30 minutes so you don't have to slave all day in the kitchen just to make a healthy meal. The only downside to this book is that there are no pictures of the actual recipes. In my opinion every good cookbook needs to have a picture for every recipe so you can visualize what it is that you are trying to prepare.But overall this is an interesting recipe collection and well worth checking out."
4,Yummy *and* nutritious. Oh-- and easy,"I'm not a vegetarian, but I do like to eat a lot of vegetables. My problem has been finding recipes that 1. Don't require a million exotic ingredients and 2. are easy to prepare. This book fits the bill.Most of the recipes in here have about 8 ingredients, including spices, oil, and salt. She uses spices that are sold at my local supermarket. There's no butter or heavy whipping cream or any of the common fatty ingredients found so often in western cookbooks. It's just tasty, wholesome food.I took off a star because she occasionally lists the main ingredient by weight (eg 2 lbs spinach). I think I can probably guesstimate this, but it would be easier if she listed each ingredient by volume."
2,boring recipes and BS propaganda,"Total waste of money. The recipes are boring, hardly any ingredients; might be okay for someone that has really never cooked international food or wants fast super-simple stuff. Worse, the introduction included a mindless rant against genetically engineered crops, how they will ""cause starvation"" (I'm still not clear on how disease resistant drought tolerant crop varieties will lead to starvation) and it is all part of a big conspiracy by the big companies. Very unscientific. Some discussion of the topic that included all sides might have been okay, though why this needs to be part of a cookbook is beyond me. This kind of stuff only hurts the image of vegetarians and vegans."
1,Review Of Bootsy's Keepin' Dah Funk Alive 4-1995,"Let me start by saying I love Bootsy to death, he's one of my favorites from the cool funk era. This two-CD, apparently rushed, live recording degeneration really slams down his talent. There are great songs on the CD, but the reproduction seemed extremely poor. Your best bet is to buy the two CDs that precede it - ""Ahhh ... The Name is Bootsy, Baby and ""Bootsy? Player of the Year"" or ""Back in the Day: The Best of Bootsy"" and those from Parliament-Funkadelic containing the original hits ... in a nutshell, anything containing the LP or album recordings. Buy this one if you're collecting, not for listening pleasure ... unless you love live recordings of moderate to poor quality."
5,The best,This is the best for any aches and pains you might get over the years.I love the size of this one because it can cover all parts of the body.
3,Good,Does not stay hot as long as billed. At least not for me. I need to reheat it after about 15 mins.
4,BIG SOUND FROM A LITTLE MACHINE,"IJUST GOT MY MICROSYSTEM TODAY. I'M VERY PLEASED WITH IT. THE SOUND QUALITY IS EXTREMELY CLEAR AND CRISP. I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO SOUND LIKE A BIG BOOM BOX, BUT IT DOES. IT LOOKS SHARP ON MY DESK. IT IS VERY EASY TO SET UP, JUST ADD THE WIRES FOR THE SPEAKERS AND THAT IS IT. THE REMOTE, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS A LITTLE TRICKY. IT TOOK ME A FEW TRIES BEFORE IT WOULD LET ME PROGRAM THE TIME AND OTHER STUFF, PRESETS ETC.... ALL IN ALL I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS SYSTEM. I ONLY GAVE IT 4 STARS DUE TO THE REMOTE SET UP. OTHER THAN THAT THIS LITTLE SYSTEM IS 5 STARS ALL THE WAY."
3,tough to program clock,"I just acquired this stereo system. Although it looks and sounds good, I have not figured out how to set the clock/timer yet. The ""owner's manual"" is actually just a list of specs. If anyone knows how to program the clock please post it for me! Thanks!"
3,Product is fine but not delivered at the time promised,"I got this book for my friend in India and it is a very good book. I paid around $50 in shipping, because I wanted it to be shipped sooner. They promised me that the book will reach to destination in 2-3 days (They know it is an international shipping address, they charged extra for this), but the product took a lot more time (nearly 15days) to be delivered."
5,Resurrects dying dremels,"Before tossing that dremel, replace the brushes. There isn't much to review other than these being OEM direct replacements that work like a champ. They're easy to install and are obviously much cheaper than buying a new dremel. If you have a dremel that hesitates or have to coax to get running, toss in 2 of these."
5,My Dremel works again,After owning my Dremel for almost 10 years it started cutting off intermittently for no apparent reason. I would have to shake it and turn it on and off to get it to start up again. Replacing the brushes corrected this issue and it runs like it was new.
5,Good as new,"My dremel was dead as these brushes were ""frozen"" inside the unit. I had to take the entire unit apart to get the old ones out. Once they were out it worked a good as new! I was planning to buy a new one but just saved $80 - $100."
3,Short commentary on Revelation,"Had a difficult time figuring out whether or not he was futurist. I finally found out that he believes that most if not all of Revelation is in the future. The key word for this commentary is ""brief."" Which is not bad if you need a quick commentary. Other than that, it is good for reference and there are some good nuggets in the commentary. Not bad for free."
4,Great blade for cutting landscaping stones,"I've used this blade to make thousands of cuts. I use it to cut sandstone, manufactured concrete blocks, bricks and landscape pavers. The blade is great for scoring material also. Most of all it makes a nice clean cut and it cuts through material that is 8 inches thick. No other blade can do that.Thank you for a great product"
1,Merely derivative from the timeless source,"I'm sure that Norman means well, as would anyone who spent some time with Yogananda, but this effort is a tame contribution (even a mere distraction) when seen beside Yogananda's own instruction in the SRF Lessons. yogananda-srf dot org will give you a glimpse of the untainted purity, loyalty, and humble service of those who faithfully reproduce the yoga master's timeless titles.If you are unfamiliar with Yogananda - the source from which Norman is derivative - just sample his Autobiography of a Yogi. Other books acclaimed as ""life changing"" pale by comparison. Look up on Amazon at ISBN: 0876120796 ."
1,Not Paramahansa Yogananda's Kriya Yoga,"I've seen Norman Paulsen's video and read the book that goes with it, The Sacred Science of Meditation. If you're looking for the Kriya Yoga that ParamahansaYogananda taught then please look into getting the ""real thing"" through the organization Yogananda himself founded for disseminating his teachings including Kriya, theSelf Realization Fellowship of Los Angeles, CA. Norman Pausen tries to use Yogananda's name to give his own teaching some clout. Why he would even refer tohimself as a direct disciple of Yogananda and yet change Kriya with his own innovations is beyond me. Loyalty and having a Guru like Yogananda are an essentialpart of the Kriya Yoga path. Norman Paulsen has said in his advertisements that this his own technique is the ""complete kriya yoga"". Don't be deceived. If you wantto get the Kriya technique of Yogananda then call Self Realization Fellowship."
1,Save your money!!,I checked out this video and accompanying book after I saw an advertisement in a Yoga magazine. The packaging is well done and pleasant on the eyes but the information isn't anything new. You can learn this type of mediation through any new agey type yoga book. Save your money!
3,"I agree, not many good tracks",I agree with the other reviews. There are only a few goodtracks here. And the reason is the music doesn't fitthe big band sound as stated in another review.Buy it on sale if you have a CD Burner to combine thegood tracks with other material.
4,Worth the money...,"Being a Vietnamese-American, I have found this book useful in supplementing what I had learned as a kid growing up in Viet Nam.The notable recipes included Beef Noodle Soup (the spice mix is the trick to get the right flavor in the broth) and spring rolls and related sauces (hoisin-based and fish-sauce based). My mother, who has been cooking since her teens, has also found the recipes very useful.My only gripe would be wanting more recipes! :)All in all, worth the money. I am looking forward to trying the dishes at Lemongrass in Sacramento."
4,Fairly straightforward and honest book on Vietnamese cooking,This book does a pretty good job of describing and detailing easy to make Vietnamese dishes. Most recipes were well-written with helpful ideas on variations and modifications. The side stories were a welcome look into the author's background and tied the recipes loosely to the culture that inspired them.The book definitely is on the light side but is a pleasant read and a good guide for Vietnamese cuisine.
2,Not Authentic Vietnamese Cooking,"There are no photographs of food, how am I suppose to know what I'm cooking and am I making it rite.Too Americanized. I want to enjoy authentic Vietnames food not Vietrican food. I bought this book so I can get away from American food but to find myself cooking Vietnamese food American style."
1,this book is not about authenticity...all recipes been revised,"i could not even use any of her recipes, because its like a mixture of recipes that she has revised for people who aren't asian to cook and eat. i am asian and i know that these are not the real recipes, any wannabe could write a book like this. and she tries to hard to be all fancy and high class with her food. she even makes up these strange names for her recipes, what a waste of money. the worst recipes ever!!!!!!!!! her thai recipes are horrible. i don't think she realize that she is vietnamese. please get back to roots lady!"
3,"a good read and nice recipes, BUT...","... what happened to authenticity (I am Vietnamese), and who stole all the pictures? There are two pages of photos, one of frequently-used spices/herbs/etc. and one of a few prepared dishes), and that's it. I just bought this book yesterday and, having read every recipe it contained, am a tad bit disappointed. As was earlier said by another reviewer, this is more creative than authenic, especially the desserts. oh, well."
2,Don't bother,"I bought this book because of the good reviews. I'm vietnamese and since moving away from home, I wanted to replicate the home cooking. Instead, what you're find is that it's not real Vietnamese or Thai but maybe a cross between the two? Requires too much ingredients (like a restaurant) so unless you want to spend up a storm of money to get a mediocre meal, don't bother. I think it's tailored more to American audience then authentic viet/thai. After about 4 recipes, I've basically gave up. The other cookbook I felt was more home/authentic in the vietnamese food dept is written by corinne trang. Hope that helps."
3,Not bad,"When I first bought this book I thought it was great but since then I have purchased Into the Vietnamese Kitchen: Treasured Foodways, Modern Flavors which is much more detailed and authentic. This ""lemongrass"" book is good for an introduction to both THAI and Vietnamese cuisine but I find it leans more towards ""Americanizing"" its flavors and for someone like myself who is trying to learn Vietnamese cuisine for her husbands sake..isn't the best. I being Hispanic, like the recipes but my Asian husband said they lacked TRUE flavor..hence my second purchase, which is a big hit. I like the Thai recipes in this book but tend to turn to the before mentioned book for Vietnamese recipes."
5,Great Tool...,"I looked through many auctions for this tool thinking they didn't make it anylonger. Time wasted. My girlfriend ordered it for me and I was thrilled to now have a new one. Great tool and handy. I'll suggest getting the Spokeshaver as well, another usefull tool to own."
3,Learn with Paddington,"Spring cleaning can be fun if you are cleaning with Paddington Bear. This book helps children learn their colors, while re-enforcing them with bright illustrations. The book, writeen without a storyline, allows children to tell their own version. Also, there are some points in the book when the different colors are mixed together, helping children understand this process. A great addition to a preschooler's bookshelf."
4,"Before the ""New Romantic"".","Having purchased these two albums back in the late seventies I was surprised to see them on disc. I was a huge Metro fan from 1977. Duncan Browne was an overlooked pioneer of cool stories of love and loss much like Bryan Ferry. The musicianship on these tracks is excellent , with standout performances by bassist John Glblin, who went on to successful gigs with Simple Minds and Brand X. If you like your music dressed to the nines and your songs soundtracks of the elusive girl that got away, Duncan Browne is your man."
5,Be Confident in the basic theology of the bible,"I read this book over a 52 week class study about 5 years ago. It changed my life. If you read this book, you'll see that D. Prince has a gifting for teaching the Word. He teaches straight from the scriptures. This book changed my life. This book is for the person who wants to seriously understand the basic theology of Christianity. You won't have to wonder about what you believe after reading this book. My bet is that you'll agree with D. Prince on 98% of things once you see how he uses the scriptures to teach you. After reading this book you'll know how to seek God on the other 2%. Don't let a negative review keep you away from this book, it is really really good. I lost my copy and am buying it again to keep for reference."
3,Kid likes it,"Good luck getting this to run under an emulator (WINE, Crossover) or a VM (Parallels, VM Ware) on a Mac. Still, it worked on an older and underpowered Windows machine, and my kid likes it."
3,Home recording book ok,"The book is reasonable. It explains EQ, mics, etc with pictures and diagrams so anyone can get it. I guess with the modern age of computer based recording a lot of it is obsolete."
1,Not As Advertised.,"This so called ""premium"" trail is supposed to contain pecans, almonds, walnuts, apricots and other standard trail mix ingredients. However, after opening 4 packages thus far, I have found a grand total of 2 walnut halves, 2 almonds, 3 apricots, and 0 pecans. I contacted the manafactuer, Harmony Foods, describing my displeasure with this product and they wouldn't respond to my E-mail. So, beware as this product does not contain what it is supposed to, and advertised, as containing."
4,Good movie,This is a very well done movie. Gordon-Levitt is a great actor and he's taken up a really challenging role in this one. Movie takes a different take on a pretty sensitive subject
4,Intense with a tad-bit of suspense...,I like this movie because I was able to relate and understand my past experience and feelings better. Pediphiles are everywhere...small towns and big towns. They ruin children's lives...forever.I would recommend this movie to anyone who went through being touch inappropriately and is having a tough time understand why they do the things they do in their adult life.
4,Mysterious skin...,"Simple, however enjoyable in its own way. I enjoyed the sound track so much I purchase it. If you're looking for skin for get it. As I have pointed out it's simple but to the point."
3,Not for the squeamish.,"The performances are good and the no holds barred approach to a troubling topic warrants respect. The cruelty of people to each other--children to children, adults to children, children to adults--is all real and well done.That said, you will know the film's entire plot within the first five minutes; there are no surprises here. And the big non-surprise at its center is discomforting. Watch this and feel ghoulish."
4,"""I wished with all my heart we could just leave this world behind. Rise like two angels in the night and magically disappear""","Mysterious Skin (2004) directed by Gregg Araki is powerful, shocking and absolutely convincing in every detail movie about two teenagers that were deeply affected by the events of one long hot summer of their childhood; events that one of them could not forget and the other desperately tried to remember. Ten years later, their lives could not be more different - Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has became a gay hustler, cynical, manipulative but charismatic, while Brian (Brady Corbet), nervous and shy believes that he was abducted by the aliens for some strange experiments.The film like this requires very good performances from all cast members and it's got them from everybody but Gordon-Levitt is simply the shining star and I'll make sure from now on to check out all his new movies."
5,Amazing,"First of all, forgive my english. Here, in Brazil, this movie was called ""Mistérios da Carne"", something like ""Mysteries of the flesh"". Well, finally this theme was presentet without false moral. And, in a way, I saw my own child and youth times at the screen. Simply amazing: the movie, the cast, the director, soundtrack..."
4,True to the Scott Heim novel,"Director Gregg Araki's adaptation of Scott Heim's novel about child abuse is entirely true to the novel. In fact, having just read the novel before seeing the movie, I could predict every on-screen action, and the movie just became a vivid and larger-than-life version of the haunting elements of the novel. Every character was true to the novel, and the plot barely diverged from the novel's action. Would I have enjoyed this without reading the novel? I think I might have been a little confused about all the hype, because it was the novel truly brought home the real-life impacts and emotions surrounding child sexual abuse. Brian was a much stronger character in the novel, and came across as ridiculously innocent and confused in the movie. Neil, on the other hand, was strengthened by his on-screen portrayal, because his conflicted emotions over his hustling behavior were really driven home by Joseph's Gordon-Levitt's acting."
5,This is what can happen as a result of childhood sexual abuse,"Rarely do we see the consequences of male sexual abuse deplicted in such a frank way...rarely will anyone speak of these consequences, outside of those in the clinicial field. Thank you for telling ""our"" story! I would love to show this movie to everyone that works with msm sexual abuse survivors."
4,Mysterious Skin,"I thought "" Mysterious Skin"" was a very good Movie.It tackled the difficult subject matter of childhood abuse and still managed to film the scenes with sensitivity.Joseph Gordon - Levitt gave a strong performance as a teenager coming to terms with the abuse inflicted on him as a child.""Mysterious Skin"" is one of those movies that will stay with you for years to come."
4,Mysterious Skin,Haunting. Engaging. Tough. Great performances on difficult subject matter. Joseph Gordon Levitt demonstrates shows us that he can hold his own in a dramatic role. A great film.
3,"The acting saves this sad, sad movie","Had no idea that this was an LGBT genre film, therefore I found it enlightening and horrifying and sad, all at the same time. One of the protagonists was born gay, the other, not. The very last scene sums up the horror of it all."
4,I related to this movie....It hit home for me.,I found this movie a bit too realistic. For me it hit home all too real. The movie was very good and I thought the acting was superb. I would reccomend that you should see this movie...and if you have kids...you really should see this movie.... not with the kids....but to help you be prepared.
1,No,No no no no and no. The filming of this was very inappropriate and I cannot believe no one was prosecuted for how they used the minors.
4,Mysterious Dupe!,"I saw this movie in theaters when it was released,and I really enjoyed it,it was brutally honest,and touched on a subject I myself had hidden away for years. So when this Unrated directors cut became available,I was stoaked to buy it,thinking it may have some deleted or at least extended scenes in the movie,but this DVD is exactly the same as the theatrical version,save for some small extended scene clips in the special features! I feel robbed,as I already had the version released in theaters! Save the extra bucks they charge for the directors cut,and just buy the theater version."
4,Well done from the perspective of the victim child...,"As a survivor of similar events, I found this movie to be a bit hard to watch because it was well done and hit the key elements of a child victims experience."
5,A MUST have in your DVD collection,"The story, the acting, the cinematography. This is a piece of ART! And Oh my God Joseph Gordon-Levitt acting is SUPERB!, besides he's so Sexy! DO buy this one. It will make your brain work and will expand your vision."
4,Enlightening,"What a topic! We would all like to live in our worlds of make-believe and not think about this issue, but I have come to believe that this type of abuse is rampant in American society. This movie helps you to start thinking about what the after-effects are from child abuse."
1,"Good performances, terrible direction","The performances in this movie are very good. However, the actual depictions of some of the events in this movie are far too graphic and verge on parody. Some of the scenes are so over-the-top they come off as insincere and cringe-inducing. Save your money."
1,Amazon needs to wise up,"Seeing as this review is for the 'product' and not to review the movie itself I have no issues in rating this a 1 as this is coming from Amazon who really need to reevaluate the way they 'preview' movies. It's an absolute joke. The 'preview' feature shows absolutely nothing other than the studios tag in and the actors names on the screen. What information about the story of the movie can one gather from that? It's utterly pointless. Amazon, either show the movie trailers or don't bother wasting peoples time with these pointless 'previews' that do nothing but waste your customers time."
1,Compelling Trash,"I look forward to completely forgetting the horrific, gratuitous brutality in this film. A compelling piece utterly ruined by the unnecessary violent, graphic depiction of the rape of a teenage male hustler and peppered with an unnecessarily graphic and obscene portrayal of child molestation. And that was the version on cable. A movie rife with potential but utterly destroyed by Araki's extreme execution of the content. Sick trash and garbage is the unfortunate review of this movie which could have earned five stars had Araki reined in his bankrupt need to act out what would have best been left to the imagination. The ugliest movie I have ever seen."
1,mysterious skin,"Sorry I can not rate this because I never received it from vender!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!he promised me next day delivery, after I never received the first one...........never got that one either...but I am charged for it....."
3,"Good acting, unusual story but disturbing.","Excessive sex scenes often involving 8 year olds saying things 8 year old kids should not be allowed to say even for the sake of movie making. The acting was really good. I love Elizabeth Shue that's one of the reasons I rented it plus the strange UFO twist... Thought it should be interesting. What I didn't expect is it to be so well crafted and twisted. The majority of the film contains sex scenes with kid's or prostitution. I'm sure there is plenty to be said for sexual abuse leading to homsexuality, self abuse and confusion later in life but the reality is this is a film with a thin but intricate story line filled almost entirely with sex. Yeah, the worlds messed up.... and if you're the kind to revel in that then this is an excelent film for you. Don't think you'll be getting any insight into anything though. This is just storytelling with good acting, and saturated with sexual encounters between disturbed individuals."
2,Mysterious Skin,"I was quite appauled at some of the scenes and found the theme quite disturbing, a little too graphic at times."
1,"Weird, Creepy, and not worth the time to suffer through",It seems like a child molestor's wet dream. Hard to make it through and disturbing to say the least. I am gay and still very upset after watching this twisted film.
5,"Gritty, Disturbing and Poignant","Very few ""gay films"" can claim to have an impact beyond mere fluff, but this film holds its own against many mainstream releases in terms of acting/character development/plot and production values. Gordin-Levitt does an amazing job as a troubled teen who is just trying to survive given the circumstances he was brought up in. I would highly recommend this film to anyone, gay or straight. I even recommended it to my family and they liked it as well."
4,Handy little book,"Overall, a very good book.At times, tries to be too much to too many.But good info."
2,Too basic -- no technical guts,"Possibly my expectations were too high for this book -- I thought ""Computer Forensics Handbook"" would present a technical discussion of computer forensics but was disappointed. Discussion of discovery of digital evidence doesn't even come until the 10th chapter. The book tends to deal in generalities of information security and is not technical in nature.If you know nothing about cyber security and crime, then it's not a bad read. If you expect good techical discussions in computer forensics, this book falls far short. If I had read it sooner I would have returned it."
5,Durable blade and fast cutting,"I bought this blade to help cut and break up an old concrete pad in my yard, after finding that the cheap abrasive blades wore out after a couple minutes. This blade cut much quicker and showed virtually no wear when I was finished. Since then, I've been frequently using the blade to cut limestone (which it cuts like butter) and the blade still has very little wear. It does produce a lot of dust, but that should be expected when cutting masonry quickly. I'll definitely buy a new one if I eventually wear it out."
1,Paper jams all the time,Constant paper jams. Google around and you'll find others experience the same problem with the Lexmark E323.
3,Only for Banana/chip lovers out there!,OK these are good for the price! The downsize is they taste a hint of oil and banana taste like most banana chips without the insane additional stuff companies put on them. If you want a sweeter banana chip i would look elsewhere. These are really good for the current price i paid. I doubt i will buy anymore of these even for the low price for the huge bulk. I want some higher quality in artificial taste on these. I know bad for the health but so are these anyways. If you want homemade banana chips taste these are really good! If you want more sweeter stuff look somewhere else.
1,Not very appetizing or tasty...,"I thought these would be a good ""emergency"" food (for example, after an earthquake). However, after tasting these, it would have to be an emergency to get me to eat them. They have an oily coating and whenever I think about eating them, I am completely put off. I would not recommend this banana chips at all."
4,Fire Mission!,"Fire Mission! recalls the harrowing experiences of a 20-year old second lieutenant and his artillery unit during the critical Battle of Mortain in August 1944. This is a sober first hand account of how intelligence, bravery and sheer luck can combine to tilt the outcome of battles.If the reader scans only the prologue and the first chapter, Fire Mission! might be dismissed as a self-congratulatory memoir written by an aging WWII veteran. Skip these pages. The meat of the book begins on page four. Weiss chronicles in unsentimental terms the role he played as a forward observer on behalf of the 30th Infantry Division. What unfolds is part historiography and part psycho-drama.I read the book cover to cover in one sitting. It's a gripping story."
2,Didn't work with Vista,"Even though it says it will work with Vista, it didn't. I asked for a replacement and the new one didn't work either."
1,POOR PROGRAM ON POOR SOFTWARE,"Bought the 4 CD Algebra series and with the 2nd disk's installation, I was advised to DISABLE MY VIRUS software for it? Nothing doing!So then, it would NOT load at all. Something in my VIRUS software does NOT like this series. I TRUST my VIRUS protection.I do NOT recommend this set of programs.INTO THE RECYCLE BIN!"
2,Can't see,"I can't see anything in the ear, even after reading and following the instructions in detail. I thought this would be better quality with a better view of the ear....this is very cheap/basic."
4,Good product,"This is a simple otoscope, not the quality one sees in a medical office; however, it works fine and meets my needs."
3,Not that great.,I work at a doctors office so I'm used to seeing into ears very clearly with the otoscopes at work. I bought this to check my daughter's ears. I can hardly see her eardrum at all. So very faint and at just the right angle. Blurry looking. This scope may be good for seeing a possible object obstructing the ear or if the ear is red but I wouldn't rely on it to tell if my girl has an ear infection. I'm going to look around for a better one myself. But on the plus side it's better than nothing and she loves to play doctor with it.
3,It's probably the user and not the product...,"The product probably works well, but I am unable to see the eardrum clearly in my 12 month old son's ear. I see hair and some wax, but am not confident that I am viewing the eardrum correctly or that I would be able to spot fluid or an infection based on the picture examples they provide in the booklet. Maybe I will attempt to bring it to his next well visit to see if the pediatrician can help give me some clarity..."
3,"Good product, but don't expect miracles","My now 10 month old has had repeat ear infections for the last 4 months. I purchased this in hopes that I would be able to see inside of his ears and know for a fact whether or not I needed to take him back to the doctor.I gave this 3 stars because we haven't had any problems with it; we just can't see anything inside of my son's ear besides ear wax. Granted, I am not in the medical profession and am by far no expert, but with all the good reviews I figured it would help us out, but it hasn't. So far it has been a waste of money for us. Maybe we will get more use out of it when he gets a little older and less squrimy (or can be bribed to sit still, lol)."
2,eh,"Can't decide to give it a 2 or 3 star rating. I didn't find the instructions clear enough to get a decent view of the eardrum on any of my 4 kids. They all complain that it hurt, and my husband and I tried it on each other and it actually does kind of hurt. Also, I hate that it comes w/ nothing in the way of a case- pretty inconvenient. Tonight my 3 year old complained of ear pain and has had a cold. For the first time, I saw clearly enough to *think* I may see some redness in there. We'll see if I'm right."
2,difficult to use,"I cant really see into the ear of my kids. I can see my husbands ok, but their ears much just be that much smaller its too dificult. not sure if its product or user error."
5,some peace of mind,"This is a great product with a simple sturdy design, easy to use, and with great image quality. It isn't designed to be a professional quality scope replacement, but for the layman parent it is fantastic. You should be able to at least see if there is anything to worry about in your child's ear. If everything looks ok thru the scope then the odds are that a Doctor isn't going to find anything either. And if you look and see something but aren't sure, well that is what the Doctor is for. So again I say this is a great product for what it is and its target users. It will give you some peace of mind when your little one is upset and let you know if you need to go thru the ordeal of a sick visit to your pediatrician."
4,For home use...,"My son has suffered with multiple ear infections, I needed an otoscope to be able to tell when its time to head to the doctor( when his eardrum is red and inflamed) and when he says his ear hurts just for sympathy. I think this small otoscope has all the right stuff. Its lite, useful and a good price."
4,Works well for home use,This is a nice otoscope for home use. It comes with 3 different size tips which is nice. It also has a very illuminating LED light. It's tough for me to see into the ear of my 1 yr old because she squirms but this otoscope helps a bit because the viewing area is a good size.
4,"Awesome, Simple, Great Value","I bought this since my daughter seems to be prone to ear infections. I find that the light is nice and bright. It's LED-based so that should lead to much longer battery life. It's very solid and comfortable to hold. And the included instruction sheet has some nice pictures of different types of ear drums to help you figure out what you are looking at. (Although, Wikipedia also has some great information to read on the topic.) My only complaint is that the outer edge of the plastic tips can cause some pain when inserted. The edges need to be more rounded to prevent that from happening."
5,light othoscope,"it's a light othoscope, it's very easy to deal with it. Bright light, esay to see. Easy to carry"
1,Great but easily broken,"This was a lifesaver on multiple occasions but after a simple drop off the counter (only a few feet on to carpet), a piece that is used to reflect on the inside broke. Super disappointing and now it's useless! Wish it was made a little sturdier, especially because it's made for home use."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a little disappointed with this otoscope. I know it is a cheap one, but if the tips would not fall off so easily, then I might be able to see in my son's ear."
5,Every mom should get this otoscope.,"I own this otoscope and I absolutely love it. It's very easy to use, lightweight but sturdy, the magnification and clarity compares to the ones used by the medical offices. Comes in with bateries and disposable specula, this way germs are not spread from the infected ear into the healthy one. My son had an ear infection when I got it, and I was able to see it easily using this otoscope. Moms wondering why little ones cry all night should get this otoscope: it's probably an ear infection."
1,Piece of junk,"I'm not sure why this otoscope is getting such great reviews. As soon as I opened the package, I knew it was going back to Amazon. It was light weight... so light weight that if my kids got a hold of it, it would break in a moment. I put batteries in to see how it worked and the light wouldn't even turn on. They were brand new batteries. Needless to say, I returned the item and had no issues thanks to Amazon's awesome return center. I'll be investing my money elsewhere."
2,"poor visibility, no magnification, cheap plastic","i recommend spending a few extra dollars and getting an otoscope with some magnification, this one is very low quality"
1,I'm a Physician Assistant,"Do NOT get this otoscope! I am a physician assistant and bought this otoscope so I do not have to take my boys to the pediatrician every time i suspect an ear infection. I don't know if I had a defective product but I couldn't see ANYTHING! never mind their tympanic membrane, i could barley see their ear canal. the light was so dull and dim. I'm searching for the perfect otoscope for a cheap price. I used to have a welch allen but lost it. don't think anything will compare to that but at least something to see the ear drum. totally disappointed."
2,"Works well, but...","I am only giving this two stars because this item does not really come with instructions. I used it on my daughter and ended up scratching ear canal pretty badly. I had to take her to the ER. I'm a pretty intelligent person and I used to work as a Vet Tech in an animal hospital so I know how to use an otoscope, but the specula that come with it are pretty long and can obviously do harm to the ear. Beware. You can see into the canal and the eardrum pretty well, but the manufacturer could do a little better with the instructions (or lack thereof) that they include."
3,Poor visual on the ear drum,"Poor visual of the eardrum, have to really stick it in to get a clear view, not tolerable by kids."
4,Great to have on hand!,"I love this thing pretty much through and through. The device itself is made well, it comes with 3 different ear fittings and is very compact. Only 2 complaints: 1) I wish it had some kind of case to put it in with the other fittings, even if it were just a cloth zipper pouch or something, but it doesnt come with anything- so dont lose the parts. 2) I wish it came with a better pamplet to describe what it is youre looking at. It comes with a very brief picture page of 4 different ear issues but thats it. Would be nice to see a little more or refer you to a webpage that offers more info for looking into the ear. Based on those 2 complaints, I rated it a 4 our of 5 stars, but the otoscope itself Id rate a full 5 stars! Over all the otoscope is great to have on hand just to take a peak. My son had an ear infection for 5+ weeks and I was able to keep an eye on it with this and not make so many trips to the DR to get it evaluated. The price is also GREAT! Id recommend it 100X!"
5,Greatttt,"I love mine. My sons ears are extremely waxy so with this product I would look inside, clean them and check them constantly ... He's only 2 and his hearing was being affected because of all the wax build up.. So I thank this easy inexpensive product. It helps a lot."
5,love it,"I love this otoscope! I am a nursing student and a mother of 2 young kids, 1 who has chronic ear problems. This product has already saved 2 office visits in 2 months. The great price is added savingsfor my family!"
5,Best for the money,We bought a junkie one at CVS for the same amount but you couldn't see well but this on allows you to see really well and have a picture guide to tell you what to look for.
4,great for checking ear,saves us from going into MD just for ear checks. does take some learning to visualize ear drums if you've never done it. i used these in college for learning ear checks so it didn't take long for me to remember.
3,ok.. not professional quality,"Not bad for the price. I've never used a professional one, but I assume a professional one would be of higher quality"
1,"No QC, another cheap product from China",I ordered this item and it arrived on time. But it was defective. No light from the LED. This can only be possible and get through to the market if there is no QC for this product. Childish design and poor quality. Manufacture claims that there is a patent pending. I wondering patent for what??!!!! I had to pack it and return for a refund. All waste of time Don't try your luck and waste your time. Go for something else.
2,Just OK,"[...]Visualization with LED is not that bright. Regular light is probably better. The mid-sized speculum (child sized) had a rough edge, and I am unable to use it on my children's ears. Actual visualization of the TM is decent. I like the stainless steel handle, makes it easy to clean. Would be better if it came with some sort of case.Great for home use. Absolutely not good for clinical use- and I am a Nurse Practitioner with experience looking at ears, and don't understand how some compare it to more expensive otoscopes. While this is OK, it is no Welch-Allyn."
3,So Far So Good,"I purchased this mainly to check my son's ears. He is a down syndrome adult, we both swim regularly. Both he and I had had our doctors remove wax from our ears. So far this product has sufficiently performed well. I have only used it once to look into his ear canals so far. The lighting is just right, I can see the inside of the ears. Although I am not a trained health care professional, so I am not that familiar of what the ear drum would look like."
3,Eh. Revised,Light is bright but the ear thingy falls off while looking in the ears. It's annoying. Switching to different head helped with it coming loose in ear.
2,Dr Mom Otoscope,"It's cheaper at Walmart ($18)! I bought this thinking Amazon was offering a better deal!! boo...I needed a cheap otoscope to look into my husband's and son's ear. I am used to using the Welch Allyn otoscope that I had while on my clinical rotations. This otoscope does not even compare to the quality WA offers, but it will do for now. I 1st used Dr. Mom to look in my husband's ear after he could not hear. The otoscope worked fine for him. I was able to see his eardrum & all. However, since my little one started having a cold, I wanted to make sure he did not have an ear infection. I could not see anything in his ear even after switching to the smallest and medium sized speculums.Needless to say, I will be investing in another Welch Allyn otoscope in the near future."
2,Not very bright,"I did a bunch of research before purchasing an otoscope and decided upon this one based on all the good reviews. I'm not in the medical field, so I can't speak on this topic from a professional standpoint, but as a mother who just wants to have a preliminary look in my kiddo's ears before hauling her off to the doc for an ear infection, I was disappointed with this product. The light is not bright enough for me to see her eardrum clearly, despite the fact that she still has little ears. I know I was using it at the correct angle because I could mostly see in there, but it was too dark to tell if there were any issues."
3,Tough for babies,"I bought this when my daughter was 1 and was getting a lot of ear infections. She has a small ear canal, and in the several months that I've had this, I have yet to get a good look at her eardrum. I have tried numerous times. I gave it 3 stars though because she is squirmy and does have the tiny ear canal. With my six year old and my husband, it did take a while to get just the right angle, but finally I've been able to see the eardrum."
3,difficult,"My now 8 month old has never been fond of having his ears ""looked"" in. Apparently he doesn't love the sensation. Anyways, I bought this in hopes of saving a trip or so to the Dr office... it hasn't served that purpose yet. He has hard wax build up so it is nearly impossible to see his eardum to begin with. He also reaches up and ""swats"" at it and turns his head while I'm trying to look. The attachment falls off easily so with the slightest movement we have to start over. Hopefully as he gets older it will be a better purchase."
3,I need training!,"The light is strong, and I like the 3 cone sizes. When I try this on my teenage son's ear, I have a hard time seeing the ear drum in focus. I will bring this to the doctor on our next visit so that I can learn how to properly hold it and know what to look for. Right now, I just see a blurry white blob at the end of the ear canal!"
3,It's Ok,"I work in a pediatric emergency department, and have used several different otoscopes. I bought this for home use. I like the handy size and different size speculums, but although the light is bright, the fact that it is so white makes the ear drum look very washed out and dull when it may be completely normal. It may unintentionally make a normal ear drum look abnormal."
3,OK,The light is pretty bright. I think the magnification could be better. I wish I would have shopped around a little more. The tips fall off easily.
2,Cheap money = cheap product,"As an ENT doctor, this thing isn't great. I wish it had a better lens that doesn't fall out with minimal carrying in white coat. Also, usual ear speculum tips don't fit it well at all - you have to buy these specific ones."
2,not good quality,Its not was i was looking for..based on the reviews it seemed ok for using at home.. i am a nurse and i really didnt like the quality. you can not see clearly inside the middle ear.
2,"Not very effective for Kids. Good to have, but not easily usable.","I purchased this model (3rd generation, with LED lights). Happy that it has LED. Was not able to see my kids ear drum. I think the focus for the lens is very short. You can see about 1cm in front of the specula, but the ear drum for our kids seem to be about 2-3 cm away from the tip of the specula.Consequence? -- I have to shove the specula deep into the kids ear to see anything & that's no way to try & relieve ear pain.If there was just some way to improve or make the magnification variable. What a difference that would make. Oh well, now using the device as a way to see things in dark holes, or just as an expensive LED torch."
3,Ok. But not great.,The focus is offwhen I used this on my 4 and 6 year old. My 8 yr. olds ears seemed easier to see. This is almost adequate enough to see the ear drum but I struggled to get a clear view on the smaller ears.
5,Works great.,Nice quality at a great price. I bought this to save myself some serious money. I am the mom who panics every time my child tugs at his ears and most of the time it is a false call. Now if I can just get my son to hold still...
4,Great scope,Love this scope and the different attachments. Needs to have a carrying case with it. The packaging isn't going to keep it all together.
5,great,this item i sgreat I always wanted to see inside the ear or some one check my ear so i order this item and i am happy my younger sone was always complaining from his ears we took to docotor many time they give us ear drop which diddnt help as soon i got this item i use it on my son ears i found out both ears i spluged with large amouth of wax so we took to doctor we tolld him ears are pluged then the doctor clean them. so i start using on my all family work great i loved.
2,Most horrible audio ever,"Protesters on the way to a rally get caught in a civil war and film a civilian slaughter. They are seen, the guide is killed and the remaining protesters are hunted down. Plot is week, alot of violence and the students seem to have the survival instincts of lemmings. The combat scenes are fairly well done, lots of ethnic hatred. The absolute worst about this movie is the audio. The movie sounds like it was recorded by a cheap toy microphone that has a short. The background music eclipses the actors several time and a lot of the conversations are barely audible. Its not the worst movie I've ever watched, the filming was well done and the actors had some talent, but on the whole I'd suggest finding another movie."
5,Our son loves this! WELL worth dusting off the VCR for!,"What an unsung GEM of Saturday Morning cartoon folklore. A MUST SEE! There is a reason why this show retains a small global cult following-it is insanely creative, intelligent and there is nothing mean or violent in it. Nothing cruel, no guns or torture like Bugs Bunny or Popeye (both of whom I love but it is far too adult and violent for my tiny child to watch.Waldo Kitty is a ""fraidy cat"" that dreams of being a hero. He has many adventures in real life action sequences which wrap around the cartoons. Such as getting shut in the garage when he gets in trouble for something the dog, Tyrone did. Then he'd imagine he could fight back and he was a starship captain ala Star Trek (Trekkies will love it!) or Catzan or Catman! Felicia, a pretty white Persian cat is his girlfriend and a great theme song too: ""He's Waldo Kitty, a meek and mild kind of cat, but I'm a daring hero, and I like being that."""
3,Book without Jacket,"I choose this rating because the book is okay, but I was expecting it to arrive complete withdust jacket which was missing, petty!"
5,Cowboys under the Mogollan Rim,"Among my favorite books. Recommended to everyone who wonders what cowboy life was like in what now is Arizona. Authentic, written in direct, clean prose."
4,"Ong Bak, B-13, Rollerball, and The Venoms Series Combined","Matrix Fan broke this flick down perfectly so I'll just toss in my two cents. Fireball is an entertaining gumbo with elements of Ong Bak, B-13, Rollerball, The Venoms Series, and other fight films tossed in. The action scenes are very gritty and will have you on the edge of your seats. I didn't think the basketball/fight club combo would work but it is very convincing. To sum this all up, buy it if you collect Martial Arts films or rent it for a quick action fix. Offbeat goodies like this never end up on cable television's so-called action channels."
3,Works,Looks classy and does the job. It seems to be fairly accurate. We've had it on the porch for a few years and there's no sign of weathering.
2,disappointment,"I was eagerly awaiting this book, but ended up very disappointed. The 16 essays are scrupulously researched and illustrated, but I found the subjects far too specific and arcane for my tastes.It is obvious that Ricky Jay has a love for the topics, and that shows, but they weren't topics I needed to know this much detail about."
5,An absolute must for ECK terms,The Lexicon will give clear definitions of terms and meanings to words used when studying Eckankar.Eckankar literature uses most of these terms while one reads ECK materials.This book will help anyone get a more clear picture of the proper meaning and how it is used.
5,Workplace writers talk about what they learn,"This book is easy to read. It is full of direct quotes: young writers talk about what it takes to write well in a nonprofit environment, where success depends on tact, grace, and knowing the audience. Executive Director Mei talks about the genres and techniques that young writers must learn. There are before-and-after examples. As a professional teacher of business writing, I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what writing is really like after you graduate from college and get that first job in a service or nonprofit business."
1,Disappointing re-creation of Switchfoot,"If your expectations are to purchase this music, see and play the guitar chords that Switchfoot plays you will be very disappointed. The suggested chords sound nothing like the actual song. I was especially disappointed in ""Dare You to Move"" which has a quite wonderful, very distinct acoustic guitar opening. The book's version, however, is quite poor sounding nothing like the actual song. I had to go to ""You Tube"" and find everyday folks doing covers to learn how to play the song since this book fell so short."
4,Your American history research needs this reference,"I only have one thing to say: If you are wanting to have any serious understanding of American history, then you need this book in your library."
1,"OK for a casual read, poor for anything else","This book is suitable for an introductory overview of the larger wars in American history, but if you want anything more then look somewhere else. The authors often make fairly large generalizations based on limited evidence and their citations are difficult to follow given their confusing system of references. Instead of using the standard footnotes or endnotes, they use a ""selected bibliography"" format so it is almost impossible to tell where they got a specific piece of information from. The references listed in the ""selected bibliography"" as well as the full bibliography do not seem to be complete. I would not recommend this book."
4,Student's Review,"This book is an essential addition to the library of any military history student. The downside of this book is also its strength. For example, the material is very broad because it covers such a long span of time. The best part about this book is that since it is broad it is a good starting point. Reading the chapters that relate to a topic one wishes to research is a good method to get going in the right direction. It will give one a general understanding of events. It is also a solid secondary source which will point one's research in the right direction rather than complete the whole story."
2,"One mask was great, the other two were defective","I really like these masks, good seal and fit, but only one has an adequate strap. My kids have small heads and they couldn't fit the masks on at all! One out of three works, the others are useless. Very annoying!"
4,furniture book,"Great book, great pictures at some parts hard to read the plans but makes up for it in detail of craftsmanship. much recommended for antique replica furniture builders."
4,Christina's Regal Review,"Bought these for my father-in-law. Only has edema from his toes to his knees. Needed the higher compression to make sure they would actually provide some help. Make sure that you talk with your doctor prior to deciding on what compression of stockings to get. Don't wear them to bed at night. Hand wash only, so buy two pairs so you can wash them each night if needed. Make sure you don't have any areas that are too tight and causing circulation issues."
3,Slightly loose,Although these stockings are roomy enough for the toes the calf portion is too loose causing them to slip down. Another brand was too contricting in the toe area so doctor suggested these. These are for husband who was measured for this size. Will deal with the looseness but only as alternate. Package did arrive earlier than promised so that was good!
3,"Work well, but they smell","I bought these for my husband who has varicose veins and they work really well, but we've purchased Jobst from several retailers and they always smell so MUSTY right out of the box. My husband has very bad allergies so we have to wash them several times and soak them to get the musty smell out of them. It's a huge pain and I wish Jobst could see fit to figure out what's going on at their manufacturing site that makes things smell so bad. That is the only reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 or 5."
3,love/hate,"i have a love/hate relationship with this movie, its deeply flawed but the performances of louis garrel and Lea Seydoux are just perfect and the chemistry between those two amazing and i realy liked their story and their lines or to be accurate the lack of it when you are truly in love who needs words (maybe a spoiler)am absolutely fond of the scene in the hotel but i liked the fact that they didnt need to explain or talk through every step or move. i love Christophe Honore but this was not one of his best, i feel that if this was a short movie focused only on those two and the silent intensity of the connection between the two charecters it would have been great because the other characters and thier story lines were just pointless and yes boring and just unnecessary, if you are a fan of louis garrel watch it if you are not dont bother"
3,Pretty but nothing special,"Well produced and photographed, a nothing special movie centering around a group students in their senior years at a French School.As seen in this type of movie, the usual ""Classroom antics"" of smiles, glances and the passing of little notes around the room.Rent, first up if you can. The story could well be the same at a school telling the story of students much younger, with not much difference as it plays out.I would also add that the ""Rating"" could actually be ""R"" as really nothing here to justify the ""Not Rated"" category, but not really suitable for very young people.I'm always suspicious that the ever growing numbers of movies with this NR category is a bit of an intentional ploy from the movie houses which has the affect of pushing sales."
1,"After abour 10 minutes, you realize...","...that this movie is boring beyond belief, going nowhere, has NO real plot & can't be entertaining!! It is only about an arrogant self-centered group of teenagers, nothing more or less!! So unless you consider yourself one of these, don't waste your time!! Also you need a cheat sheet to keep track of who is sleeping with whom! The girls are ordinary looking & the pretty boys are worse--not even any 'eye candy' to redeem this sad attempt at a French art movie. See a classic like 'Amelie' for a true French treat!"
3,"I liked it, but...","This was actually quite an interesting book. I found the assignments interesting, and challenging yet able to be completed for the most part.Now we come to the problem. When you are asked to answer a question in an assignment, and you contact the author of the book and the ""creators"" of Linux who both agree the question can not be answered as asked, we get into a bit of weirdness.Even the author says the ""official"" solution to some of the problems in the book are done in exactly the way he requests them not to be done in the book, simply because it is impossible to solve the problem in Linux as asked.So, if you're looking for something that makes you think about ways to accomplish assigned tasks, this is a good book. If you want a book without errors and having all questions capable of being answered as asked, this is not as good of a book.Therefore I give it 3 stars, to put it right in the middle."
4,What a good book,"The story is about a young girl named Kara,who is sick as a small child and was brought to a cave to be buried. Instead of dying,dragons fed her milk,which nursed her back to heallth. This milk also gave her speial powers. Kara meets the royal family ofthe land of Krag because of her powers, which throws her into the middle of a of a blood war between dragons and this royal family. Kara has mant adventures as shetries to do the right thing for the family and the dragons. The prince of thisfamly,Rog,threatens to kill two childrenif Kara doesn't sumomon dragons for him to kill. She gets help from the kiing and his army,the birds that she summons,and her friends. They defeat Rog,and her falcon flies off with dragons. Kara goes back to the king dom of Krag with king Orrik as his summoner.I like this book because there are plenty of suprises. It issuspenseful and exciting."
2,hard beats and rhymes,gutter flows and westcoast flavor W rocks the mic swiftly and delivers on point. Original Rose Town reppin full of witty ad libs and metaphors that will keep the party jumpin!
2,Reznor writes a better mix,"The remix by Reznor completely blows away the Puff Daddy version. Instead of a monotonous pattern with subtle changes, Reznor creates an ingenious mix with intricate programming. I doubt Reznor spent a lot of time on this song, but still it grooves more than Puffy's. If your a Reznor fan, a real fan, this may be a good purchase on your part--for Reznor's mix. Puffy needs to learn more about writing from Reznor."
3,Clean Beats,"I expected the radio version of Victory to be edited for language, but I was disappointed that the drama mix and the Been Around the World remix were clean versions as well. The price was a little much for just three songs, but I bought it for nostalgia, not to mention the beats to the two songs are some of my favorites to this day. The lyrics? Not so much."
2,biggie and busta makes this song enjoyable,"puffy's trying to hard to cash in still his verses [are weak], the beat [is weak] biggie smalls and busta ryhmes makes this tolerable."
5,waterways on dvd,"saw this show on TV, didn't have a chance to record series, found it online, now I can enjoy this anytime"
2,Great idea- Very poor construction and quality control.,"$280 for the sloppy quality control and poor manufacturing that I see? No. Very poorly made. Mine was drop-shipped from Pearl. The box was perfect- no impact evident. But, the backrest leans to one side by at least an inch or more. This is supposed to be the top-of-the-line? And on a throne that costs $280, should you see staples on the backrest? No. I called Pearl customer service, and the guy actually said that the backrest misalignment was because it had been ""tightened down too much- I'm not saying you did this, but""... Ridiculous.There is no way to lock the seat to the base and still have the seat swivel. Loosen enough for the seat to swivel, and the seat will come right off if you lift the whole thing by the seat.Great idea, poor execution. I'll not buy Pearl ever again."
1,Fumio,"This CD was very disappointing for $15.00. I listened to it several times, trying to give it the benefit of the doubt. It just didn't get any better. Very boring music. I go to sleep by music every night. This definitely did not relax me and send me into la la land. It makes me leary about ordering more music through the internet.Thank you for your time,IVY"
5,Emotions and Steam Abound,"From the seductive tales of myth to the fantastic legends of true life romances, Ms. Karin Kallmaker allows us to peek into the happenings of 18th & Castro on Halloween. Ms. Kallmaker spins the colorful thread of each unique character's fabric of fate to weave a magical tapestry of lust and love. With sensuously skillful caresses of erotic imagery, Ms. Kallmaker reminds us that each of us leaves an impression on those around us, knowingly or not. Once again, Ms. Kallmaker craftily passes on the passionate conviction that all women are sexy, even those covered in maggots. It's Halloween on 18th & Castro. Laugh, shed tears, and be seduced. You won't be disappointed."
3,"Nice theme, but average content","I'm not sure if this qualifies as an anthology since all the stories are written by one author. I really like that all the stories take place on Halloween, however, only about half of the stories really caught my attention. There's a good mix of ""scenes"", so you might find something you really like."
3,Technique versus talent,"This analogy was okay. I liked a few of the stories. But it wasn't great. I guess I kept waiting for a slightly longer story or deeper story that allowed me to connect more with the characters. The only one that really did that for me was about the Ex having sex with ex-partner's new lover watching her. I won't spoil the story.Frankly, I read the exceeding complex reviews of the 5 stars and I wondered if we read the same book. Yes it was neat that all the gals lived or visited the same apt building and all seemed to have sex. But that idea to base a book on just didn't hold it together for me. I have read a lot of erotica and while this was varied it was just okay. Don't believe the hype."
5,"A lovely little collection of brief, memorable, poetic gems.","Showcased with illustrations by Kent Jackson, Harald Prommel's Two Hearts Talking is a lovely little collection of brief, memorable, superbly crafted poetic gems is powerfully inspirational and profoundly spiritual. Promise: Softly/you wander through/the shadows of my mind,/assuring me I'll never be alone."
4,volume #8: Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad Jungle : 35 minutes in EP mode !,"I would have given this tape 5 stars had it been recorded in SP mode and had more than 30 minutes of cartoons on it!The few cartoons are:1) (George of the Jungle) THE TROUBLE I'VE SEED - Dr. Chicago has stolen Ursala with his thieving plants!2) (Super Chicken) DR. GIZMO - The world's trickiest crook matches half-wits with the feathered crusader.A 5 minute music video: ""Watch Out For That Tree"" appears here.3) (Tom Slick) OVERSTOCKED - Tom tries his luck at the slots as he races against the meanest man in slotcar racing, Sweet Willie Rollbar.4) (George of the Jungle) UNGAWA THE GORILLA GOD - The Boondockie tribe wants George to wrestle a giant ape for the title of King of the Junge."
4,I loved this book!,"When I picked this book up and started reading, I got sucked in immediately. I had already finished 100 pages before I even realized it. It was a very fast read, with several funny parts. I ended up reading it in 2 days because I couldn't put it down. If you're looking for a light, funny, heart-warming book this is the one for you. And who wouldn't love a kid like Dexter? :)"
2,Not worth the time,"THE NERD WHO LOVED ME is just plain pointless. The story is so inconsequential that it doesn't even make sense.Why couldn't a woman with a thirteen year old son marry the terrific guy who's the great love of her life?I don't want to give away the ending but it, too, seems implausible, even for fiction.Author Vicki Lewis Thompson's writing is fine in itself, and the subplot about the retired Vegas showgirls is clever. Still, the whole plot here is so pointless that reading this romance seems like a complete waste of time."
3,A mixed bag,"Most people's objection (if they had one) to Nerd in Shining Armor was that the heroine was distasteful. My objection here was to the hero - not that he was unpleasant, just that he wasn't well-portrayed as a nerd. The charm of Nerd in Shining Armor was the metamorphosis of the hero into a hero. Here it seemed to me that Harry was already there. This may be due to the fact that the plot was so overwhelming that none of the characters really got deep enough for my tastes.I enjoyed this book, no doubt about it. It was a pleasant way to spend a Sunday afternoon, and the writing was smoother than I recall the first one being. That said, it read like a typical romance novel, rather than an addition to the genre. I recommend it absolutely, but I hope in the next book, the nerd is just a little bit nerdier."
2,Goes overboard with the silliness.,"This book is a bunch of silly nothingness. Sometimes, if I'm in the mood, that can appeal to me; but not in this case. I almost didn't finish it, which would have rated 1 star; but I plowed on through to the end and will give it 2 stars just for accomplishing that. But, sorry, it goes in the discard pile."
5,must-have reggae,This album belongs in just about ANY well-rounded music collection. It is true reggae in the classic sense.
5,THE GUARDIAN IS AWESOME!!!,"THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIE BACK IN THE DAY, AND IT STILL RATES 5 STARS WITH ME. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY. WELL WORTH THE MONEY SPENT."
3,OK HORROR MOVIE IF YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO!,"I saw this movie a while ago and I don't remember much about it, really. It was just your typical psycho nanny movie witha few dumb supernatural twists to it. The movie didn't make much sense, was often boring, and not scary. Dissapointment from the director of THE EXORCIST.........."
4,sleeping bag,We bought two of these so that we could zip them together. It worked well and two slept comfortably inside. Warm and cozy down to about 45 degrees. Good price and excellent value.
1,Defective Design,"I bought one of these for a simple 2 wire setup (R and W wires). From the manual it looks like you can use it for that. The first one I installed did not work and the customer service person asked me about my setup, we checked that the wiring setup I had was good (touch red to white to make sure it goes on), but it did not work, so they told me it was defective. I went to get another one, and same thing. The think is, if you look at how it's made, it looks like they have connected the wrong posts -- the metal connector that works when you touch the wire to it is not attached to the W wire screw. I tried a different thermostat and it worked fine. So either both of the these CT31A thermostats I bought were defective, or the thermostat was mis-manufactured with a flawed design, or it's not designed to work with a 2 wire setup (though the manual does not say so).Would love to hear from Honeywell what the issue is with this thermostat."
4,Skimpy on the Special Features--but still good!,"I was disappointed that there weren't more special features. I've watched all of the Project Runway Seasons and enjoy them all. I was hoping for more in the Special Features. Missing follow-up on other finalists, favorite desingers and no reunion show. I think Kinley was the most memorable designer on the show. Where is she now?"
5,"Again, Very Entertaining","As with previous 4 seasons, this one was very entertaining. But I thought that the quality of the designers was not quite up to snuff compared to prior seasons. Especially the early eliminations - some of these designers were just odd, and not so talented. The final 4 were quite good, though."
5,Awesome,It came very promptly after I placed my order. Loved every minute of the show. Great company to work with.
3,fun but a bit disappointing,"I LOVE project runway. since it doesn't run in germany (where i live) i always order the dvds from the US. so i wonder everytime why they cannot just NOT tell the winner on the backside of the dvd?? this time i just didn't look on the backside, but then the winner was shown in the menue of the dvd....i missed the reunion and also the ""wear are they now"" - there was just a short interview with the winner. the extras are too few.heidi strikes me as quite heartless - there is never any empathy and she just says her lines.but still i watched the season in almos just one go! it's marvellous. but no project runway season will ever come up to season 2 (santino!). that was the BEST."
4,This book has the right attitude,"I just bought this book and really like its approach. When I was looking in the store I checked all of the books for correcting redeye, which I have done quite a bit in Elements. Most of the other books basically tell you how to follow the directions that Elements gives you. This book said something like ""OK, that is what Elements tells you, but as you can see it didn't work very well. Here is the way to fix redeye manually."" This is the kind of information that I would buy a book for!"
3,Great Bronzer,"I love the bronzer in this lotion, also it goes on silky smooth. It does not leave you feeling sticky. Although it smells horrible. If you can stand the smell the lotion is great!"
1,Not what I thought I was ordering,I thought the filter was supposed to be larger - I guess it was just a mixup on the model number. So it doesn't fit my humidifier. The picture of the humidifier when I was ordering looked like mine.
5,Great Healthy crackers,"I have really enjoyed these crackers. I was on a diet that required that I eat crackers, and these were tasty and filling. They make these crackers in many varieties, but I like the light rye topped with cheese. Amazon provided the best price by far, and I'm glad to know I can find a good assortment here."
2,exp.date,Just bought a case of 12 boxes 9-15-10 They exp.12-2-10 No wonder there on sale Ryvita thats not right.Will be stale very soon.Won't but again.
3,Good while it lasted,Worked nicely for approx. one year then began providing erratic readings...then no readings.
2,"Loved It, Dropped It, Broke It","We bought 2 of these -- one for us and one for my elderly parents. The large digital readout and no tapping were the selling points. Ours is still working, but my dad must have dropped theirs because 2 of the 4 springs popped out. I put the springs back in, but now it says ""---- err"". One mistake dropping it and it's ready for the junk pile."
2,"Not lasting, broke in less than 6 months","Bought mine in May 2005, now the only thing the scale shows is ""-----"" and ""Err"", even after I put in a brand new battery.Now it is a big task to dig out the old paperwork and look up whether I can get any kind of warranty."
1,boo,"Add me to the list of not working after less than a year. Same ""---"" and ""err.""Spend your money wisely and choose a better scale."
2,Doesn't Last Long,"I bought this scale a little over a year ago and it worked great. Although it was put away in a closet for half a year, I brought it back out and it refused to work. Tried new batteries but nothing works. Doesn't Last Long."
1,Short Life San,"Bought mine in Jan 2007, now the only thing the scale shows is ""-----"" and ""Err"", even after I put in a brand new battery.Found no warrantee information in the paperwork or on the web site. Piece ofjunk... but great while it worked."
2,Broken card shuffler,The card shuffler did not work on one sides....my nephew finally took it apart and found one of the wires that were soddered to the connection had come loose. He fixed it but that should not have been necessary. I am not happy with the card shuffler.....way too cheesey!
2,Issues with the basket,"I've noticed that the basket that the filter sits in tends to swing out during brewing, generally far enough that the pause 'n serve is set off, but the water still drips into the basket, making it overflow and make a massive mess"
1,"really, really bad",I got this coffee pot in december (around christmas time) and Now I am shopping for a new one. The lid on the top now doesn't close all the way and we have to set something heavy on top of it for it to keep perking. otherwise there will be 4 cuts of brewed coffee and 4 cups of water! would not recommend.
3,A good collection of other people's ideas,"This book is just a collection of other people's ideas as is common in the New Age publishing industry. But this, in itself, is not so bad. This book brings together a lot of different ideas for prayer and visualization. That is not a bad thing, but if you have been reading these sorts of books for a long time then you will certainly want to pass on this one."
2,Just another phone case,"This phone case looks good and the phone fits nicely in it. The belt clip is terrible, it keeps falling off, I can see me losing my phone. I wish someone could make a nice case with a good clip, that's all I ask for."
3,leather case for w580i,"looks good. w580i fits perfectly inside..it would have been given 5 stars if it was a magnetic flap, instead it is a velcro flap."
3,Its Good but...,I like it. The only problem I found is that the clip forusing it on the belt is short and you have to continuoslycheck the case because otherwise it felt down.
4,A good hero and an even better heroine,"I like historical fiction, and so I decided to check this book out. The beginning almost made me disappointed, but the by the end I couldn't put it down. It is quite engrossing and kept me on edge, even though the ending was qutie predictable. But the tortures the characters went through sincerely moved me. I recommend this book for anyone who is quite bored and would like to find some entertainment for a couple of hours. The villains' inner thoughts are thoroughly explained, so that they become humans instead of just the ""villains."" The heroine was perhaps not as well in depth, and was quite pious, strong, and good. And the hero as well."
2,obsolete,"I really liked this Cd-Rom when I was in high school when it first came out, but at this point it is not worth buying. It's so old that it will not work on any computer that isn't about a decade old."
1,Doesn't hold up to a bumpy ride,"I bought this based on the other reviews, and I am very dissapointed. I use it for my Blackberry 8705, but unfortunately after going over a few bumps or potholes the side adjuster becomes loose, meaning that my BBerry ends up on the floor of my car. Also, if you have vents that are at an angle rather than at 90 degrees, then it is also difficult to attach. (I know I can use the double sided tape...but who wants to leave a sticky mark on their dashboard). I'll be looking for something else, as I like the concept."
1,Phone slips through,"I have a slim phone, it just slips through. Bottom ledge is too short and is flat, no guard to stop the phone. It appears designed for thick devices, sides are not adjustable for device thickness. Really poor."
4,works great,"this item stays on the vent very nicely and holds my ""my touch"" even when plugged in from the bottom."
4,Works very well,This holds my iPod Touch perfectly and attached effortlessly to the vents. I added a bit of sticky-backed foam to the parts the iPod rests against to prevent it from jiggling and to hold the device more gently and firmly. The need to do that is why I gave this four instead of five stars. I would absolutely buy it again.
4,Type S Universal Holder,"Product works as advertised. I am using it in conjunction with a Bracketron holder to mount a TomTom ONE to my center dash vents.Not a product comment, but a vendor comment. My package arrived with the bubble pack already cut open. Product itself did not appear to be used, however with the package CUT open, it leads one to wonder."
4,Decent for the price,This product works great for holding my ipod video so I can listen to my music in the car without having to look down whenever I want to change the song. I only wish that I had more of an ability to change how the holder actually fitted to the ipod. Overall this is a great buy.
2,The bad thing about Universal holders is. . .,"They don't really fit anything. I bought this for my iPhone, and intended to use it to hold the iPhone on pullable golf cart or when occasionally in a riding cart. Any little bump or jar, and I had to go diving for my iPhone to catch it as it popped out of the holder several times. I even glued the adjustable opening in position so that it snugly held my iPhone and it still didn't really hold it securely. I now have a cozy hanging from my golf bag, and put my iphone in it when walking the golfcourse. Problem solved, and I got the cozy for free at the company picnic."
2,Not so good on the connecting ends,One of the connecting ends was partially intermittent. You can shake it and make the signal go in and out.
5,tiny turtles crib set,"This product is great material and put togethor well. I loved this set! It was well worth the money i paid for it which was 170, but I would order it through baby supermall and have them email you about any sells on the product there is a link on the product that has them email you on a discount on the product. Plus its free shipping and free delivery! Well worth it! plus you get a 90 day warranty on it! check it out! I wouldnt listen to one persons opinion about it, it hasnt fallen apart on me at all yet, and you can always email baby supermall if it does!"
1,don't buy!,It is cheap material and is very poorly put together. One of our bumper covers ripped all the way across the top and the blanket ripped too. It has Tons of loose strings everywhere. Very cute but Not worth it! I wish I hadn't purchased this crib set.
5,Never lost again,Excellent compass for the adventurer or just a hike. Easy to get bearings and good dimensions for hand fit. I actually purchased this for flying star feng shui measurements but like it so well it goes with everytime (have six other compass's) I want to go get lost.
3,"Good compass, but no declination adjustment","Overall, this is a solid compass, and will give you accurate readings. It's durable, and easy to use. If you only have twenty dollars to spend on a compass, you'll be happy with this one.That being said, I would recommend spending over twice as much for one that has a declination adjustment. When I bought this one, I assumed it could be adjusted so it would stay set. Unfortunatly, this is not the case. You will need to manually adjust your map (a hassle) or manually add/subtract the declination with every reading (a hassle). I hate doing either of these, so off I go to spend fifty bucks on one that has a declination adjustment.- Alleyrat"
2,Compass design has changed from photo,"I was disappointed that the product I received had changed and did not match the photo. Specifically, it did not have the orienting lines on the baseplate. Depending on how you plan to use the compass, this may not be an issue, but it definitely is less useful for orienteering."
3,Good basic compass,"A compass is a very simple device requiring attention to detail in order to distinguish your brand from another. The Explorer 203 is basic hiking and orienteering compass with a good balance of function to features.Good:Liquid FilledAnnoying:The font and gradation marks on the dial are bold obscuring the North index line (red outline around ""N"" makes it worse)There is no luminous material on the needle or red orienting arrow.Note that although this compass uses the Silva brand name, it is not manufactured by Silva of Sweden. Johnson Outdoors Inc. has the rights to the Silva brand in the USA. This compass is made in Indonesia."
5,Probably the best compass made,"I have gone through a number of compasses as an avid outdoorsman and gift giver. The Silva Explorer 203 is probably the benchmark compass - best bang for the buck with quality, features and price."
4,compass for backup,"works just fine, arrived on time. No complaints here. I just bought it for a spare backup compass to use."
4,Giving Away Simone,"I commend the author for her diligence in creating a relationship with her child. It is good reading for adoptive parents, particularly those involved in open adoption."
2,Mediocre,"I purchased this to give to my daycare provider to use with my son and the other pre-speech children she cares for. There are a lot of useful and practical signs, but it was just plain old boring. I had purchased Volume 1 of the Baby Signing Time series several weeks prior, so perhaps I was expecting something just as catchy and entertaining. If you are looking to hold children's attention while teaching them sign language, there are definitely a lot better ones out there."
3,"OK, but......","I purchased this DVD for my son's day care provider because it seemed to go over the majority of what I consider to be the important beginning signs.I like this DVD because it divides the signs up into different chapters. I also like that on one DVD you learn all of the signs that a baby needs-mommy, daddy, milk, bottle, diaper, eat, more, please, thank you, etc. I think that it is nice that they feature special needs children.We have the first two of the ""My Baby Can Talk"" DVDs at home. I prefer those because they are more eye catching to my son.They hold his attention much longer.I was disappointed with this DVD overall. It appears to be very low-budget (especially for the price I paid for it!). I do agree with other reviewers that the ""Say it with a Sign"" moves very quickly!I would not purchase another DVD in this series-I would stick with ""My Baby Can Talk""."
1,Not a very good teaching guide for those of us with sign language literacy,"I purchased this as well as volume 2 and have been nothing but disappointed. I am extremely versed in both English and ASL as I've grown up with a deaf sister for over 37 yrs. The signs are silly. The teachers go from teaching ""mother"" to teaching ""cows"". They even teach such silly things that are common place such as eyes, nose and mouth that we all teach to our babies as they grow. I found that I am better off teaching my babies the sign myself (now that I am home more and not working 60 hours a week) since it is correct and not contradicting as are most of the signs in these videos. I warn others to NOT purchase these as they are awful."
3,a little fast paced,"my daughter loves signing videos and does like this one although I tend to think that it's a little fast paced. The repetition is very good and beneficial but the speed of the repetition is too fast. I also think the women that do the signs are a little annoying but it's probably due again to the pace of the video. Regardless, my daughter has found this video helpful and has learned a few words that she hadn't known before."
4,"Great beginners book, wonderful advice","This book helped me setup my first marine aquarium. The advice on setup, run up and maintenance is well written and interjected with great wit every once in a while. It is packed with very useful information. The book is very close to a perfect marine starter manual. It's only flaws lack of some graphics (such as the disease section) and in organization. That is the only reason I did not give the book a five star rating. These minor flaws are easily overlooked and overshadowed by the wealth of the book. If you are a first time marine aquarianist (as am I) this is a well-written, excellent book to start with. If you have been in the hobby for a while, it is an excellent reference."
4,"Solid material, a little dated","This is an excellent book to use as background and reference for marine aquarium keeping. There are other books that cover species identification, and I would not buy this book for that purpose. You need this book to understand the principles of filtration systems, recognition and treatment of disease and all of the underlying knowledge that will allow you to be successful in maintaining a marine aquarium. It is in need of revision to cover more recent advances in reefkeeping, though."
2,Can find more information on the internet and forums,"Although this book covers a decent spectrum of information, a lot of information is outdated and to today's standards considered wrong or bad for your aquarium. You can honestly learn more about salt water aquariums by reading through and joining forums. That way you can ask questions and get answers from other peoples experiences and opinions. There are also a ton of online articles and magazines that provide a ton of more (and up to date) information. just want to point out 2 things that the author seemed to press in this book that are IMO wrong. undergravel filters are horrible for saltwater applications. And please don't start out a saltwater hobby with a 20 gallon tank. when it comes to saltwater aquariums THE BIGGER THE BETTER. you have more room for error in a larger aquarium and can keep the water more stable. So start with that big tank you've always wanted instead of wasting a ton of time and money on a 20 gallon."

1,Does Not Fit M18 Cordless Grinder,"I bought a bare tool M18 4 1/2 inch cordless grinder, and wanted a case. The Amazon description for this case is vague and suggests that the case fits all Milwaukee 4 1/2 inch disc grinders. Well, it doesn't fit the M18--too small. I called Milwaukee Customer Service and they confirmed this; Milwaukee doesn't make a plastic case for the M18 tool of this type. You have to get a ""Contractor's Bag"" for storage if that works for you. I think I'll just store it in something else."
2,Does Not Fit All Grinders,"This is the only case that Milwaukee offers for their 4 1/2"" grinders. It does oes not fit my 6140-30 4 1/2"" grinder. I had to modify the case to make my grinder fit in it. I expected better from Milwaukee."
1,Amazon Fails AGAIN,"I found out too late the carrying case does not fit the magnum. This ""failure to fit"" information came from another Internet based supplier. Then I spotted the customer review at amazon who apparently had the same problem. He is correct ""Not Cool Amazon""."

3,???,"After 25 days of regular use and no noticeable effect from taking this product (sold by Swanson), I decided to switch over to another brand from a different manufacturer, which seemed to be working just fine after a couple of weeks. Under the circumstances, I cannot say for sure whether the product from Swanson would've worked after the first 25 or 30 days of regular use. Frankly, I expected to see some good results after the first couple of weeks, which didn't happen. This doesn't mean that anyone else taking Prostate Essentials will not have a better experience than what I had."
3,"Vintage Chatwin, but not his best.","Fans of the great journeyman and travel writer Bruce Chatwin will not be disappointed by this collection of essays and short stories. Some of the fiction is quite nice, if esoteric (but very Chatwin); the essays on art are a little more digestable, if a little vague since they are removed from their original context.Not the greatest of books, but certainly not a failure or something a big fan should miss."
2,stick with songlines & what am I doing here,"I was happy come across a book by Chatwin and another title that seemed to make sense to me. But - disapointment followed. This book is full of name dropping and references so obscure to a time and age that is really only talking to the gilded ex-pats of yore that were sitting in their chestnut studies in the colonised counties and it doesn;t go much beyond that. I think the basis for better is there in, say, the chapter ""the Morality of Things"" but published as it is, it is still unformed. The same goes for the Nomad chapters. Basically, these works were left unpublished for a reason. They should have stayed that way. Bruce has died and we should just appreciate his words from his own hand. I suggest you stick with the real Bruce."
5,perfectly beautiful,"The Living Road creates a lush, mysterious and eloquent ambiance. It is a great work of art. Lhasa's lyrics are simple and strong, and she sings with a soulful longing that is earthy and real. The three languages on the album add a variety which i feel clarifies and enhances the experience. I don't think that everyone in the world would come to love an artist like Lhasa, but I certainly do love this genuinely honest and perfectly beautiful music which certainly stands alone."
5,Charming and Addictive,"I was initially surprised by the music because I bought La Llorona first. I loved La Llorona for its traditional feel. The Living Road is different but is also such a beautiful cd, I'd recommend it to anyone. The mixture of French, English and Spanish is wonderful."
5,One day....,"I was listening to this while walking home from the subway, and as I exited the station ""Soon this space will be too small"" came on. There was a gentle snow falling, and everything was quiet and it was the perfect moment. My personal soundtrack for that particular moment. Haunting."
2,A big let down,"Lhasa's La Llorona is the best c.d. I've bought in a long time,I'd put it up there with Bob Dylan's Nashville Skyline as one I never tire of.It was full of texture,soul and just great music.I was really excited to find there was a second c.d. by Lhasa,even though it was $27.I happily paid it and waited several weeks for it to arrive.It arrived yesterday and I sat down to listen, and what a let down.I thought, well maybe it has to grow on you so I listened again a couple more times, and it didn't get any better.It's flat, boring and uninspired.It doesn't even come close to La Llorona.I hate to give a bad review especially to an artist that I think is incredible,But this c.d. isn't worth waiting for."

2,A Regretable Failure,"Big Beverage (a novel), William Campbell; Tupper & Love (1952)Written by Cot Campbell's loquacious father, Cot later remarked in his excellent memoir that ""the story behind the book [Big Beverage] is a sad one."" And its instant demise upon publication ensued.Margin note on page 364: ""If you had written this, you'd be home by now (65 pages to go).""What would have been a dynamite 300-page novel about the allegedly rapacious executives of the Coca Cola Company in its formative years is, instead, a 429-page excruciatingly self-indulgent soap opera with force fields of limitless adjectives that in outer space could pulverize planets.What a shame that so much writing talent went to waste - doomed by the author's obsessions & resentments. Pulped 10/01/10."
1,Advertisement Brochure,"This book just ponders various selfhelp jargons such as sub-conscious, visualisation, mantras, meditation, vegan diet etc., but at the end of each chapter the Author says us to attend his 3 days ZeNLP course to know more about that.All over the book the Author insists us to find our unconscious mapping but there is no detailed instruction on how to find the mapping.The whole book is advertisement for the 3 days course.So it is waste of time and money."
5,Ice,"I loved it. No joke. It was so good. Better than good ,Amazing, Best Book ,Like For Reals. Hope He keeps writing more books(:"
5,Awesome Sauce!,"I got this book on a whim. Zane (an author) has posted a link to this on her Facebook page as a free Kindle download. So I took her up on the opportunity. I read this in a few hours, I was completely captivated by the characters, the story, setting, and plot. The struggle of Dio as a latino ""thug"" transforming and growing into a man was entrancing. Reading this from the male perspective was eye opening. I enjoyed this book very much. I definitely will be reading more books by Jeff Rivera."
2,it was ok,it was ok ...maybe a little too slow for my taste but it was an ok book. i would borrow rather than purchase
4,"Forever my Lady, Good Read","""I received a complimentary copy of this book in order toreview it. this is not something I would of normally bought, but after reading this book, I would buy books from this author. I enjoyed reading the book Forever My Lady by Jeff Rivera. It's about a Latino gang member, whose girlfriend, got shot in a drive by shooting. Not really sure why but he was sent to prison boot camp. It's a good story about his struggles at boot camp and how he became a man and learned how to handle his anger issues. He thinks about his girlfriend constantly and also thinks about their future together. They write letters back and forth and you learn more about their relationship.The only thing I didn't like was all the Spanish/slang words used, (with no translation. Sometimes I just had to guess what he was talking about.I would recommend this book."
5,"Super cool book, even cooler author",Jeff even emails you back with his suggestions. I've been passing this wonderful novel around to younger friends. I'll buy any book written by Jeff Rivera.
2,interesting,"I received a complimentary book for my kindle in order to review it. It was about a couple inner city youth and their lives, falling in love with each other, their families and their personal commitments. If you are not interested in inner city lives, do not read this book. There is profanity, some implied and descriptive sexual scenes, and violence. Bullying, as well.It is a romance of sorts but more a coming of age book. I do not personally recommend it."
4,Voted Best Urban Fiction 2005,"Forever My Lady is remarkable love story. Dio is sent to boot camp and later finds out his lady is pregnant. The only thing he can think of is getting back home to her. While at camp you see Dio grow from a thug into a man. You root for him and you hope that he and Jennifer can stand the winds of time. The supporting characters are well developed. This was an oustanding story. I hate the fact that Rivera left me hanging for the next book. I'm left with so many questions as to what will happen next. come on with book 2.Voted Best Urban Fiction 2005Voted Best New Author 2005Mahogany Media ReviewAlbany, N.Y."
4,Forever My Lady,Having finished Mr. Rivera's book in record time I felt compelled to add my thoughts here. I must admit the subject matter was new for me. A young man in deep trouble dealing with the consequences of his actions. After I read the first chapter Dio became a real person for me and one I cared about. Such was the eloquent style of Forever My Lady. Unfamiliar situations that became very real and showed the problems our inner city's youth face everyday. This book had a continuous pace that led the reader from beginning to end. Possibly the highest compliment a reader can give to it's creator is the sadness felt when it must come to an end and you are no longer a part of the character's lives. Excellent job!
2,An OK book for high school readers,"The book is okay but sets the bar pretty low in terms of style and content for a mature adult market. The premise and the characters might be appealing to high school kids, but the entire book is too juvenile (not in the insulting sense, but chronological sense) to appeal to mature adults. In the hands of Steibeck, say, it might have been possible to have this story be a window on another world that mature readers could learn about and empathize with. As it is, it's just another teenage tale.I have to disagree with another reviewer who didn't think the constant insertion of chicano slang was realistic. San Jose CA (to name but one place) is full of Hispanic kids born in the US but who reject English as a matter of ethnic pride."
3,Growing up,"Forever my Lady is a book about growing up on the streets and what you do to survive, even if that means getting sent to ""boot camp"". Two lost souls find each other when they were kids, but there world falls a[art when Dio gets in trouble and is sent to boot camp. Thru time and developing special friendships, Dio finds himself. He learns the joy of competing - winning and losing. He learns how to succeed in life with the help of his new found friends. Meanwhile the love of his life, Jennifer doesnt feel the same anymore. The ebook version was horrible grammar. The title and numbers and were like on every other page, which made it difficult to read this book. I recieved a complimetary copy of the book for review"
1,Run Away Screaming!,"The unit was defective when received. The pushbutton to open the CD player door only works about 1% of the time. I had to push the door away from the latch mechanism in order to get it to release. Also, a 'thump' comes from the speakers every time the unit starts to play the first song on a CD and again at the beginning of all the rest of the songs. This is true regardless if the CD is a commercial product, a computer burned CD-R with .cda files or a commercial CD with MPEG encoded files on it."
2,Could Have Been a Contender,"Sadly I am returning the second of these for the same defect. I was pleased with the capabilities of the unit. I can't however, overlook it's one shortcoming. Both units I tried produced an audible ""thump"" between tracks. This occurred with MP3 discs, and regular CD's, purchased or ""burned"". When hooked to an amplifier this was especially annoying. Audio playback units are not supposed to introduce audible signals of their own."
4,another tough one,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.Exactly as described, this is a combination of ab moves and pushups. While it is a good strength workout, there is no cardio element. Short but tough. Will have to work my way up to completing it with them.There is some bongo? type music but very minimal. Would have liked a constant count since you are facing away from the TV most of the time (probably too difficult for anyone while doing the moves for half an hour) or at least just a plain, loud beat matched to the moves to keep time to. Good tips from instructor on keeping form.A welcome addition from a favorite instructor."
3,Naive---but still interesting.,"I find this book like a kind of effort to move over with a new plot. I mean this by the following. In the original book, we are told the story of Muad'dib, a man destined to be a king, a messiah. This is more than enough plot to write a series of books (Just what Herbert did) but in this book we're introduced to the son of Muad'dib, a child with tremendous powers and thus, more powerful that his own father. This, at least according to my point of view, contradicts the original plot of a man destined to be Emperor. Personally, I would have prefered Herbert to keep the original storyline and let Paul, and not Leto, the one who overtook the transformation. Still, this is no boring book, it is quite interesting, and the last pages are worth the book's price. Even if Leto had been just a bit more mature, I would have given this book the full five stars. Sorry, it could not be this time."
4,Intriguing,"Alright, there's no question in my mind that Herbert is one of the all-time masters. There are very few who give him any sort of challenge. Even if you go beyond the Dune Chronicles, to his earlier works, you see that it is obvious he is a master of the un-happy ending. I loved Children of Dune. It redeemed Messiah and lightened God Emperor. Focusing on little Leto and Ghanima gave the story a new facet and the end....oh boy. I'm not too old, but I am somewhat well-read, and these books, Children of Dune right along with them, are still among my favorites. Frank is one of my idols and it pains me to think that he will write no more."
4,Key element,"The book is a sad end to Paul Muad'Dib, however it is a key element for the following novels, introducing the character Leto Atreides. Read this book if you are going to continue the Dune saga."
3,It held my attention,"As a precursor, I would have assigned three and a half stars were it possible. Children of Dune is an average piece of work. It doesn't really break any new ground. It strikes me as an interesting hybrid of Dune and Dune Messiah, in that it possesses a semblance of Dune's action, mystery, and political intrigue while also being somewhat bogged down in Dune Messiah's slow pace. Don't feel compelled to read this unless you're interested in reading the rest of the series. This book does not add to the first two books, in my opinion."
4,Not as good as the rest,"This book is not as good as the original, but the series really picks up again in the next one."
4,"Alia-of-the-Knife, take over!","In the wake of Muad'Dib's disappearance the Atreides are in as much peril as when ""the house generators"" were down and they were left wide open to Harkonnen attack. This time, however, the threat, though similar in source, is horribly different in nature. The Atreides' children must look to their elders for aid...or it may be forced upon them! A truly great ending to the first trilogy of the chronicles"
2,A let down,"I loved ""Dune"" and ""Dune Messiah,"" and after reading them I naturally wanted to dive straight into ""Children of Dune."" While it starts off well, it soon degenerates, and its ending is one of the most dissapointing I have ever read. Unlike Paul Atreidies, who had a human side that the reader could relate to, his son Leto II is distant, pretentious, and completely uninteresting. His immense power and knowledge make it impossible for the reader to care what happens to him. Neither Jessica nor Alia stand as the fascinating characters they were in ""Dune"" and ""Dune Messiah"" respectfully. A downright dissapointment in every aspect.This book left a bitter, sour taste in my mouth after I read it, and remains my least favorite of the Dune saga."
2,Not worth reading.,"I thought that this book did not live up to the others in the series. It's quite boring and hard to get through, unlike it's predesesors. Read it only if you plan to read the whole series."
5,CHILDREN OF DUNE,"Though I could have sworn that I had ordered a hardback copy of this book, I received a paperback. The book came neatly and carefully packed. Its condition was mint as far as I am concerned. In addition to its expert packing, it came in just as expected. I am completely satisfied with this company and will continue to do business with them.As for the story itself, currently I am reading book 2 of the series, so I cannot as yet comment. I have just finished readding ""Heretics of Dune"". I am very much enthralled by this series and though I read ""Dune"" many years ago. I was not aware of the follow up books being this good. I had tried the next 2 books in the series and was not impressed. However, after reading the latest series of pre-Dune books. My interest was re-awakened. I was then that I discovered that there was a series of books and that I had been reading out of order. I have taken steps now to correct that error."
5,A wonderful book,"This series is the best in all scifi. It puts Tolkien to shame a hundred times over. The plots are complicated, but actually MAKE SENSE!!!!!! Tolkien on the other hand seemed convinced to only write one series, so he wrote LOTR, but put in mindless information about everyones lineage that should have been turned into a prequel, and not included. But this tells us what we need to know, and that's it."
1,What a load of twaddle,I really liked Dune. I persevered with Dune Messiah but found this almost unreadable. It seemed as if the author had run out of ideas. It is a big muddle.
2,Ick Ick Ick,Ok I thought this book was the most god awful thing that I had ever read besides an Agatha Christe book and the Silmarilian. I loved all the other books of this series except this one. The only reason I continued to read this novel was so that I whould know what was going on in God Emperor Dune. I even had to read a different book just to get that book out of my system.
5,DUNE HOUSE ATREIDES,"HOUSE ATREIDES FILLS IN MANY OF THE BLANKS THAT ARE ONLY HINTED AT IN THE ORIGINAL SERIES. WE ARE INTRODUCED TO THE FLEDGELING LETO ATREIDES,THE EVIL AND TWISTED BARON VLADIMIR HARKONNEN, AND THE NOBLE PAULUS ATREIDES. THERE IS A CONTINUED GREAT FEEL TO THE NEW STORY AS WAS FELT IN DUNE. WE ARE GIVEN A VERY PERSONAL VIEW OF HOW YOUNG LETO ATREIDES MUST BECOME A LEADER BEFORE HIS TIME AFTER THE UNTIMELY DEATH OF HIS FATHER. LUSH AND BRUTAL LOCALES ARE ALSO A TREAT; FROM THE LOVELY WATER COVERED PLANET CALADAN TO THE DESERT FILLED BUT MYSTERIOUSLY INTOXICATING ARRAKIS(DUNE), THIS BOOK IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SCIENCE FICTION FAN EVEN IF YOU AREN'T A FAN OF HERBERT'S WORK."
3,Kids nowadays ...,"Children of Dune moved on a generation from Paul Atreides, focussing on Paul and Chani's children Leto and Ghanima. In line with the changes taking place on the surface of Dune many characters that were easy to pigeonhole in the past, such as Stilgar, Duncan Idaho, Alia, even Irulan, are developed into being far deeper and the interactions far more complex. I thoroughly enjoyed this particular episode of the Dune series, Frank Herbert's sometimes heavygoing style was not too bad and he paints a clear picture of all the different intrigues. If you've bought Dune and Dune Messiah, and enjoyed them, don't be afraid to buy this next installment.That said, if you want a truly great read of the Dune worlds, however, buy the books written by Brian Herbert (Frank's son) and Kevin Anderson. I bought all 6 and thought they were as good or better than the original Dune book, which is still my favourite of the original series."
4,Great reading...lots of detail,"I've just started reading this book. Although I've read other books by this author, I could not remember reading this one. I've enjoyed reading all of the ""Dune"" books. The book arrived very early and in near new condition."
3,Falling short of the original.,"Although he maintains the complexity and insight in his writing, Herbert fails here to achieve the epic quality of the original Dune. I read Children of Dune years ago, after allowing some time to pass between my reading of Dune Messiah, and years from the original Dune. I remember it was very hard to get into and I felt nothing for any of the characters. I recently re-read it immediately after re-reading the first two in sequence, and this time I found the characters a little more likeable & understandable, if slightly inconsistent in their behavior from book to book. The sense of social evolution and an understanding of human's place in their universe is still present in this telling of Dune, but gone are the little nuances that made Herbert's world so alive and intersting. This is more of a completion to the storyline, not as heart-felt and dramatic as the first of the series."
3,The Dune Saga,"The story carries on from Dune the Messiah. I did not know how old children were during this time period. And there was not any resolution to the problem of ""The Preacher"". Aleah is still crazy and that was never resolved either. The story could have given more details."
2,disappointing,"The first dune novel was fantastic. Exciting, well paced, great characters, amazingly creative. However, the follow books I find become very vague, and needlessly complicated. As the story progresses I found that too many concepts had to be filled in by the reader, as herbert refuses to explain them. I struggled through god emporer, and now can't manage to sit through the remaining two books. My advice, read Dune, and just use your imagination to fill in what happens afterwards, it'll be more rewarding that way"
3,"Great, but not so much as the first two.","I recently came into knowledge of the ""Dune"" series, and so far this book is not my favorite. It lacked the complexity of that world created by Herbert on ""Dune"", and the story did'n't catch me like ""Dune Messiah"". This book runs through several storylines, and the one I found the most interesting was Leto's journey of self-discovery in the desert (which is essential to know if you're going to read the Fourth Book), but the whole thing is too long and sometimes runs thin on you. It's still a great story, but it wasn't as effective as its predecessors."
5,Great Book,This is a well written book - Frank Herbert does it again. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a good sci-fi book and wants to read articulate literature.
3,Pretty good read. In a way I wished I'd stopped with dune before this in,The first was amazing the second was a good enough sequel. This one kind of started to ruin it for me so not going any further
4,Wonder Twin power!,"The Atreides family lives on... thanks to the twins! Leto and Ghanima, still young but more than wise for their years alive, know their lives belong to Dune, the desert planet, and to the Fremen, the people of Dune who have raised and protected them since their birth. Once again you will witness the strength and wisdom of the Atreides. Time has passed but what seems to have changed has also always been the same. The characters we know and love and thought were gone resurface and you will also see other sides to the beloved characters of the past. A great book that keeps the story from ending..."
4,"Less action, more religion","In Chilredn of Dune, much of the action and intregue which compelled the reader in the fist two novels has been traded in for long disserations on philosophical and religious ponderings. But, nonetheless, Children of Dune still provies the reader an outstanding read."
4,Yet another sci-fi neccessity ...,"To be honest, this book started out very slow for me. The first 100 pages just seemed to drag, as if you were getting no where with the story. Then, as the reading process continued, it just kept getting better, and better, and better -- right up until the end where it concluded in astonishing brilliance! The reading gets slow at times, and light speed at others, but all in all this was an excellent book and well deserves 4 stars. Yet another sci-fi neccessity!"
3,My least favourite of the Dune series... still very good,"This book is (as the summary says) my least favourite. Why? Well, it just seemed to me all the way through that very little was happening. Certainly the ending was very interesting, but it still seemed that this book was a way to well and truly finish what Dune started, while leading up to the next book (God Emperor - which is set several millenia after this book).Still, it has its moments (in the last quarter, at least) and I certainly didn't find the book boring while getting towards the end. Even large sections of relative inactivity seem readable in Herbert's writing style, and it never seemed like hard work.Read this book, then move on to the last half of Herbert's trilogy. By The Way... this probably deserves more than 3-stars relative to most books, but within the Dune series it just doesn't keep up."
3,End of the Original Trilogy,"Children of Dune ends the original Dune trilogy. It takes place a few years after Dune Messiah. Paul's children Leto and Ghanima are pawns in the Struggle for power between Alia, Jessica and the nephew of the deposed emperor. However the twins have plans of their own and Leto intends to follow the path that Paul would not folow, while the mysterious preacher lurks in the background.Compared to Dune Messiah, it is a little lighter on intrigue, and a little lighter on philosophy but there is still plenty of both. A major theme from the first book, ecology, is returned to. Arrakis is slowly being changed from the complete desert it once was. An ecosystem is a very complicated system and change may produce unforssen consequences. Children of Dune is more coherent than the Dune Messiah, but isn't as memorable."
3,Ok but not great,"This the third book in the Dune series I felt was kind of a depressing end to the story line of Paul and his imediate family. The first book in the series really does outshine the next two in its scope and thoroughness. You can really tell Frank Herbert was trying to extend his Arrakis roots with the way he hints to previous events before the time of the first novel and so forth.All in all, its an ok read. It is worth it just to finish out the plotline established in the first book."
2,I got bored with it,"""Children of Dune"" is not a bad book, but I got bored with it and with the whole series. I remember starting the fourth book of the series and putting it down after 5 or 10 pages because I could not take it any longer. However, ""Children ..."" is decent enough and does help wrap up some of the story threads that started with ""Dune"" Unfortunately, I found it to be work to get done with it.I always am amazed that this series has been so popular. In my opinion the first three books start with a great book, then fade. I could not take some of the sillyness of the rest of the series."
3,Not what I'm looking for!,"This book seems to be written in the form of how the author would configure an ISA Server. I personaly purchase IT based books strictly as reference manauls for my career, and this book leans more towards a ""senarios"" slant."
5,A bloody good read!,"Beware Buffy the Vampire Slayer, there's a new group of hunters in town and their methods are based in fact, not fiction. Billed as the ultimate vampire novel, in Beware the Leaven Vanore wastes no time in correcting (or explaining) some of the more obscure habits of vampirism. But that's just half of why readers will enjoy this book. There are compelling characters, a budding romance, a Latin lesson or two and a plot twist that will have you shaking your head wondering why no one thought of it before. In Beware the Leaven, Vanore weaves fact with fiction so intricately that even readers who don't believe in the existence of vampires will find themselves wondering ... maybe ... It's an educational read, a fun read and, after the final battle of good and evil is fought with provocative implications, you know that you can't wait for the further adventures of archeologist Steven Lynus, sociologist Helen Norwich and assistant medical examiner Nate Forester."
3,Nice Try,"Vanore's premise is excellent and he's obviously familiar with the Vampire genre but I found the writing lacking a certain ""bite."" This self-published novel (iUniverse) could've given us so much more. Anne Rice has nothing to worry about here."
5,Perfectly Seamless Book,"This is a lucid, sexy and brave account of the author's marriages and love affairs. It tells these stories in a humorous and ironic voice, giving acid pen-portraits by the way of several celebrated New York artists and intellectuals. The title story tells of the author's last and lasting marriage -- a ""marriage into sickness"" -- to a writer with multiple sclerosis. This chapter should be required reading for all who have to deal not only with the presence at home of a cruelly progressive affliction, but also with the necessity of dealing with sometimes venal, sometimes violent household help. In the final chapter, the author deploys her gifts as a historian (she is the author of All the Right Enemies: the Life and Murder of Carlo Tresca). Here she narrates the story of a second cousin in Moscow. The chapter is called ""Dumb Luck""; it poignantly justifies its epigraph from Wislawa Szymborska: ""What.../ If I'd been born/ in the wrong tribe,/ with all roads closed before me?"""
2,Forgets to focus on the central idea of tantra,"This book has many excellent articles. Yet, it forgets to focus on the central idea of tantra which is the connections between the outer and inner cosmologies. The contributions thus get lost in the details, unable to find the grammar that would unlock the esoteric language of the medieval tantra texts."
1,Unacknowledged contributors,"The correct title of the book should read Tantra in Practice (Princeton Readings in Religions) by David Gordon White (Editor), Beavis and Butthead."
1,Making Balzac English Spoken is an abomination!,"I unfortunately got this substitute for the real thing. I did not have the imagination to even think that you would make Jeanne Moreay, Depardieu og Fanny Ardant speak english and ruin the whole film in the process.Whoever made that stupid decision should be kicked in the bud for a week, because not only have this person undone most of the nerve in the film, the fact that you can get this version, has made the original version almost impossible to get.If one cannot bear listening to French, and the saw dusted tounge of Jeanne Moreau, which is so much the very essence of Balzac's mother - One should not attemt to even see Balzac.Let us have the choise of the real thing and burn this copy in Hell."
1,Not in the original language,I bought this movie only because I thought it was in French. The site doesn't say it is in English.
2,I bought the film to LISTEN and see Depardieu. This was very disappointing for me because I did not realize the voice Dubbing.,I did not realize the Dubbing of the voices. I was so excited to hear Depardieu and when I heard this other voice I thought at first it was being told from a different person for a moment. Then when I never heard Depardieu in this whole movie it ruin it for me. The movie sets and film was great but the voice dubbing was terrible. I was so disappointed.I do not recommend buying this version.Should it come out with the actual voices of the actors then I will buy it.
3,"Review of ""Balzac - A Passionate Life""",An interesting telling of the life of a 19th century French author who is not all that well known outside literary circles. It is well acted with beautiful costumes and scenery. A major flaw in this Lionsgate presentation is the fact that the film is badly dubbed in English with no French soundtrack. It would have been far better in the original French with English subtitles (which are available as an option in this print). The original intent may have been a dual soundtrack. They really dropped the ball on this one.
5,Balzac,Read the book many years ago. The movie is as good as the book. I recommend to people who like to explore the biography of famous people.
3,"You might like this title, you might not","I liked this book for the ideas and coold hard facts it gave me about mage the ascension. It needed a little more work around the edges, but that didn't bother me."
3,Difficult to follow,"The story reveals it self at the end, but far too long after I lost interest and stopped paying attention. Good acting, but poor adaptation."
1,how shallow,i love david foster wallace... this film is shallow... i recommend you to read his books...
2,Interesting But Feels Lacking,"The topics the film brings up are very thought-provoking, especially the idea of how people treat other people as objects in everyday life.The story wasn't very cohesive. After I finished viewing it, there was just this feeling of ""Really? That's it?""I don't know."
4,"Hahahahah! Loved it! Slimy, self-pitying, self-serving, self-absorbed,power-mongering men...nails 'em.","JK is a fantastic writer, producer and directory. Loved every minute of this clever, quirky, well-excecuted, actually brilliant film. My favorite two parts: First,the scene with the African American son and his father, a wash-room attendant in a tony men's club. It's a play within a play, a poignant, exquisite poem. My husband and I were speechless when it was over. I would own the DVD just for this alone. Second, I loved how John completely trashed our image of him as an adorable, woman-loving charmer on ""The Office,"" the perfect boyfriend, husband, etc. I'll never look at him the same again. What a hoot - fabulous soliloquy and great way to end the film. I'm recommending this to all my girlfriends and the men who can handle it."
4,Great adaptation of a terrible book.,"I read the book first, which was a mistake. I already wrote in my book review how awful and painful the book was to read. But, when I saw that Krasinski had adapted the book into a film, I had to take the time to check it out. After all, I am a huge fan if his.What a wonderful movie. I really liked it. It was af if poor Krasinski sorted through the confusing, and poorly written excuse for a book and pulled out the meat and potatoes to create a wonderfully interesting story.Great job on intertwining the interviews into something that actually makes sense.The only negative point, is that Krasinski kept the Foster's langauage the same as the book. In written word it makes sense, but when you transalte it to film, you quickly realize that people just don't talk like that. I don't care how intelligent they are. But, in the end it didn't take much away from the movie. I still really enjoyed this film."
3,Smaller than expected,These were much smaller than expected. More like the size of a business card. Otherwise there are many words and this is a good way to practice.
5,this is my girlfriend's favorite CD,"My girlfriend came home from work while I was playing ""India All Over"" and she said `This is my favorite CD you have'. I usually like to put on something calming for her when she gets home like slow jazz - Chet Baker, classical - Debusey, Mozart, or what I think of as Indian Classical - Ali Akbar Kahn"
5,"Lyrical, Graceful, Read It!","This extraordinary first (and only so far, it seems) novel came my way about five years ago, and since then it has become one of my all-time favorites. Being a voracious yet disciminating reader, that's high praise from me.Moon Passage abounds with beautifully-written lines and clear-eyed, simply-delivered utterances about life's mysteries and philosphies. The characters are amusing, filling, and true. Although the story is simple and, in a way, as old as time itself, it is told so easily and with such fresh inflection that it seems as if you had never read such an original work before.This novel is highly recommended. We can only wish that Jane LeCompte will write another one."
5,This is a beautiful novel....,"set in northern California, that tells the tale of two women in love with the same man. Anne Ellis and Ellen Cassidy are separated by a generation. They turn completely different faces(content and at peace vs. energetic and naive)to the world, and are brought together by Ellen's brash act of seeking Anne out.Their relationship matures quite by accident and they both find a strength from each other that will last beyond their mutual love for one man. LeCompte wrote this, her first novel, more than 12 years ago, but it is timeless in its characteriztion and in the beauty of her love for the simpler things in life...gardening, cooking, and the love of fine literature.Really a terrific read!"
3,El Maestro Rigo,Uno de los mejores homenajes de Rigo Tovar que he oido;aunque el ritmo es totalmente diferente La perla colombiana nos trae gratos recuerdos de El Maestro Rigo Tovar
3,Typo in one area in book,It discusses one of the first Atlantic steamboat crossings and it gives both 1838 and 1848 as the year of the crossing! Obviously one of tyhe years given is a mistake. This crossing concerned a ship designed by an Englishman named Brunel
2,Too Tight For My Melon Head,"These were just too tight for me. Also, I have tenitus so the cones more or less just made the ringing in my ears echo. Might be good for someone with a smaller head and no ringing in their ears, but just not for me."
3,Great Isolation-Poor Comfort,"Very tight for a great isolation, and you hear excellent balance of drums with any other audio you may have. Hurts after an hour. In the ear plugs are easier to carry to the studio etc., but not the same quality/isolation. I'd try in the ear types first."
1,drummer in training.....,I am a student in training for drumming...and I do not like them...since it hurts your ears while drumming for an hour...I mean...really hurts your ears..since this is only in my opinion...Thank God I only use these once a week.P.Smith
3,"""Headphones""?","I think it is confusing that these are labeled as ""headphones"". I can think of several descriptions that would be clearer. ""Headphones"" PRODUCE sound where I come from, not block it."
5,A riot of nomenclature,"Frankly, it's not a very readable book. But it's fascinating in that it does list so many group names of animals. It's quite humorous in part, too."
3,Exaltation of Larks,"The book was advertised as a First Edition, first published 1968, which has a different subtitle and different introduction than subsequent editions. It was not but rather an ""Expanded Third Edition"", published after 1991. I should have known since the price was very low that it would not be a First Edition, but I trusted the advertiser. Buyer beware."
4,An Exaltation of Larks: 2,"The price was right. The service was perfect. However, I was disappointed in the condition of the book. Described as, ""Like New,"" the dust jacket was soiled and the book, when closed, exhibits a black, permanent marker line across the edges of the pages. This book was to be a gift. I had other books to choose from that were slightly more expensive, but I chose this copy because of the glowing description. I may buy from this source again, but I won't trust it's descriptions."
4,An Exaltation of Larks,"This was one of the books from my childhood that instilled in me a sense of wonder about language. That copy was lost in a house fire, so I was INCREDIBLY please to not only find the text still in print, but available in an 'ultimate' edition!This is a delight!!"
5,Wonderful read,A great book - read a few pages every night and entertain your co-workers daily at the water cooler. No end to the fun to be had with this.
3,Bad Caraf,"I really liked the way it brews coffee and the expresso machine has worked well and easy to use, however, I had to give this 3 stars because the coffe caraf pours all over the counter and the lid broke. It has two little buttons that hold it on the caraf and that is not enough. My husband said I don't care what you buy just get a coffee maker that does not pour all over. We had a cuisinart before and they are GREAT, but, I wanted a coffee/espresso duo. We will be purchasing the Krups xp1500. There will be a review after 6mo for that one."
3,Not so Great Especially for the Price,"I did not read all 100 reviews, maybe I should have. The quality of this unit is awful, thin flimsy plastic, thin glass carafe that leaks when you pour it. Makes an ok cup of coffee, but my free Gevalia unit was made much better, expected more for the price. No timer, clock, or very hot coffee for those of us who like it that way. For me the filling container is an awkward spot that may be preference. Although not very tall which may be good for some it is fairy wide. And again the cheapness and cheap look, if I had not ordered this as a gift would have returned it. At least my wife got another gift because I felt so crumby about this one...."
4,Perfect Size,"Needed a shorter coffee maker as don't have standard space between cabinets. This fit perfect. Pleased with coffee maker, and use the Espresso side to store my ""own"" coffee cup. Nice, simple design."
4,perfect for the price,this is a great little coffee maker. I am pleased with its capabilities to make a yummy espresso and a good cup of coffee.
3,adequate... far from stellar,"This is functional, but like most items that perform multiple tasks it does not seem to do any one well. Ours was receives with a broken hinge on the lid that after dealing with the particular seller for over a month for delivery we just did not feel it was worth exchanging.Gripes: We have to hold the lid of the caraf open to pour or coffee ends up on the counter more than in the cup. frother positioning... would be great for a leftie.Wanted features: timer as mentioned, and available in higer level purchases.This make good coffee and espresso, but I feel it will be a temporary item in my kitchen."
4,Drible Drible,"This is a mostly nice coffee maker. The Coffee is good, a little slow but good.Expresso works well.My only issues are:1. The seal for the expresso side comes out everytime you unscrew the lid. I suppose I will glue it in when I decide what glue will be best for the rubber.2. The carafe seems impossible to pour from without spilling. Drible drible drible.Other then those issues I am happy with the coffee maker."
3,Some Disappointment,"I eyed up this machine for a month before I bought it. I was really disappointed the coffee pot dripped all over the place the 1st time I poured a cup. I tried pouring with the lid up, it helped a little. I decided to keep the machine anyway and resigned to keeping a paper towel under it when I pour. It doesnt come with a tamp or tin cup for the frother. I didnt realize just how much counter space it was going to take up. I like the multiple options and the small 8 cup pot, just wish it didnt drip everywhere."
3,Lid cracked into 3 pieces,"I like this pot, but lid somehow cracked into 3 giant pieces???? I do not know how. I know I did not break it--but I'm not the only one living here. I suspect it was a stress fracture in plastic--anyway,--tried gluing--MESS. So with broken lid, very easy to forget to place water wand back over grounds after filling filter, so have had some water mishaps, which caused damage to hardwood floor and cabinet--(my husband makes my coffee before he leaves, so it it a few hours before I find mess) I liked this pot because it fit under cabinet without pulling forward to fill--I like the water portion you fill and place onto unit w/o top filling with carafe. The carafe does leak alot too, so there are alot of negatives, but if I can find a new lid, I would still keep this unit. Makes good coffee. Have not even tried espresso side."
2,Luke warm,We expected more from the Mr.Coffee brand. The espresso section works fine but the coffee maker takes a long time to brew luke warm coffee. The carafe is very poorly designed.If you don't pour very slowly you'll spill all over the place. Now we have to return this piece of crap and shop for one that works. Our new one wont be made by Mr.Coffee!
4,Mostly great!,"I really want to totally *love* this machine, and I mostly do, but I have been having an issue with it barely heating up milk with the steam arm. I've worked as a barista in a few places for years, and it's not like I expect this to work like a commercial grade machine, but I would really love it to get the milk hot enough. I always end up having to microwave my drink after I make it because this gets the milk barely luke-warm. Maybe someone can help me with that.Other than that, it's been an awesome purchase. I'm really glad I got it and love being able to have a latte in the morning! For the price it's been great!"
3,a few issues...,"The coffee brews warm, not hot, and if you put milk or cream in your coffee you'll have to microwave it, and if you're not careful when pouring, the coffee will spill everywhere. On the other hand, the espresso brews hot and steams milk well. We mainly use this for the espresso only since the coffee side is not up to par. I guess you get what you pay for, cheap price, cheap product."
4,Quality Coffee Maker,"The last review on this item was 2007, so I was reluctant to try it out. I have been using an older Mr. Coffee Espresso maker for years and desired a combination coffee/espresso product.The coffee drip is quick and the detachable water canister does not leak. The coffee maker is compact and fits well on the counter top. I am very happy with the purchase."
3,NOT BAD FOR THE MONEY,THIS UNIT WORKS GREAT BUT THE BURNER PLATE DID NOT HOLD UP WELL. THE FINISH WAS OFF OF THE BURNER IN A FEW MONTHS. THIS WAS MY SECOND ONE LIKE THIS AND I DON'T THINK I'LL BUY ANOTHER.
3,"Good machine for the price, not top quality","This machine makes really good coffee, but it is a bit slow brewing. The one thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't have a set timer, so don't plan on smelling coffee when you wake up in the morning. The arm of the frother is set a bit low also. It will take practice to get the frothing down, but overall it was worth what I paid for it! I'm please overall!"
3,Coffee Maker +,Works Great! Only thing that is missing is a clock and brew timer. If you like having a pot waiting for you when you get up this one won't do it. If I had known it didn't have a clock and timer I would have found one that did. Other than that it's a good coffee maker.
1,Waste of money,What a mistake. Great if you like lukewarm coffee. Warming plate is exactly that... warmer. Carafe is poorly designed... dribbles when you try to pour. Last Mr. Coffee product I'll ever buy.
3,nice coffee maker,"i've had this since fathers day 2010 and i like it, but the heater for the coffee part is starting to chip away and is almost rusting! the steamer for the milk is also difficult to operate. overall, a good coffee brewer but i wouldn't buy another."
1,Horrible - pot leaks,My husband and I were very displeased with this coffee maker. Thankfully Target was willing to return the item for us. The coffee pot leaks when pouring a cup of joe and got worse over time. I would have a puddle of coffee after pouring a cup of joe. The espresso maker also didn't work. I returned this and got a JUST a plain jane coffee maker. I am now a happy person!
3,get something that does one thing well.,I was excited when my coffee maker arrived and started to set it. up. The directions said to run water through it to clean it out first. So I did the coffee maker side then started in on the espresso side. The water came out looking like I had just brewed coffee. It was so dark. I probably ran it through 20 - 30 times before I was satisifed that there was no more sludge or residue coming through. It took me 2 days of running it anytime I was in the kitchen.The espresso is okay. I have to heat milk in the microwave before frothing it to get it hot enough because it is just not that hot coming out.If I had it to do again I would not get a combo. I would do one or the other and get a machine that does one thing well as opposed to 2 things with mediocrity.
4,Okay product,The only issue I have with this product is using the frother. The tube could be redesigned to allow a bit more movement when frothing the milk. Other than that it is a good buy for the money.
2,It's best to keep looking,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for myself. I've used the espresso part a few times and it works great. It's the first I've had, so I've nothing which to compare it. The coffeemaker part - I hate to say this - is the worst I've ever had. The coffee makes slowly, is much too cool, and the carafe has an itty bitty spout so it drips everywhere, no matter how slowly you pour it.After three weeks of use, the coffeemaker side no longer works. There is an internal component inside (I think my brother said it goes to the pump) that MELTED during routine use.When I purchased this unit, I did a little research and I was prepared for the espresso maker to go first, but the coffeemaker last only weeks floored me! I've had it to long to return it for a refund to get something else, so I'm hoping it doesn't cost me a ton to ship it to be replaced."
2,Does not always produce steam,"I've had this machine for just over 3 months. It does fine making espresso and coffee, although brewing a pot of coffee takes longer then my previous coffee machine, but every month the steam wand seems to work less and less. In fact, the last 5 times I've tried using the steam wand this week it has not worked. Very frustrating."
2,Carafe lid is major problem,"I see that other reviewers had the same problem as I did with the leaky carafe lid. It is a real pain....literally. When you lift the lid with your thumb as you pour to prevent spilling, you burn yourself with the steam. It is a design flaw by the manufacturer. I can't help but think that if ONE HUMAN actually tested this thing before it when on the market that this lid problem would have been corrected. I guess that doesn't happen anymore. It makes fine coffee though, and the espresso maker is very good for the money. I have had other Mr. Coffee makers in the past and have been satisfied, but this dumb carafe lid is making me question their quality control."
3,Only lasted 5 years,"I thought I'd write a review today since I've had this model coffee maker now for almost five years.Today it will be laid to rest. It started having issues a couple of years ago with the lid and ended up cracking at the top. So it's had duct tape holding the lid together for two years.A week ago we started having issues with it not working when turned on. After unplugging it, taking things out and putting them back in, we'd finally get it to work.Yesterday I got it to work, but when I poured my cup, it was only lukewarm and had to be heated in the microwave.Today it's not even working any longer. The light comes on, but apparently no one's at home.It was a nice coffee pot and will be missed.Stinks though that it only had a five year life. Now I must go out and get another coffee maker."
1,This is the evil Mr. Coffee.,"We can't return it or we would in a heartbeat. Our kids gave it to my wife and me for our anniversary. We are stuck with it until it has an unfortunate accident and breaks into a million ugly pieces.You can grow coffee faster than it brews a pot. Somehow it loses a cup of water in the process and then, when you finally get a pot brewed the spout on the carafe is designed so poorly, that unless you pour it a dribble at a time, it spills out past both sides of the miserable little lip - hot/lukewarm coffee all over the place first thing in the morning!!!Getting water into the reservoir is easy, but the reservoir will not stand up straight on its own. If you set it down in the sink, it tips over.Whoever at Mr. Coffee designed and approved this piece of garbage should find themselves applying for unemployment, if they haven't already.DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER."
3,"coffee maker 5, coffee pot 2","makes a great pot of coffee but getting the coffee out of the pot itself is another matter entirely. Drips, dribbles and splatters. You have to pour it just exactly right - not to fast and not too slow - or you will have it all over the counter.The espresso part is great all the way around."
1,Gross Coffee,"We were so excited about this machine. Now, three months later I wish it was never made.The espresso is just so-so. Everything that comes out of this machine tastes like plastic. Which means that plastic is going into your system. And thats not good, my friend, not good.The coffee it makes is horrible."
1,Don't waste your money...,This is the worst coffee maker I have ever owned! The plastic parts broke within a month and the esspresso maker didn't work. Don't waste your money on this machine!! Look elsewhere. This is now on the garage sale table.
1,you'll regret it,"poor quality. the drip coffee maker turns off for no reason. Button staysin the on position, but the light goes off and it stops brewing. when i can get it to work, it Takes way too long, coffee is only sorta kinda warm. Does not taste good.overall cheap feel, all lightweight plastic.having said all that, the espresso part does work ok."
2,The canister,It is impossible to pour from the cannister without spilling. The coffee it makes is very good. We haven't tried the steamer/expresso side.
2,Espresso with no crema is not espresso,"Save yourself some time and by a Moka machine or a French press if you can't afford a real espresso machine.I struggled with this for couple of months. Finally I bought a Saeco and I don't regret a thing. Just a few things to mention:- Drip coffee is warm. It's WARM. You have to microwave it to heat it up.- Boiler cap doesn't close right. Every once in a while it releases seam all over.- This is not an espresso machine because it uses steam power to brew the coffee. Espresso machines use a pump-driven system. No Crema at all.- Frothing system is OK I guess. But it takes forever to heat up.I give it 2 stars only because it's cheap and it works. I mean warm water comes down its nozzles. But I stop here. This is definitely not a espresso machine and not a good coffeemaker.Stay out of it. If you need one, I can send you mine. Otherwise it will go right in the garbage."
2,Works great when it works - but only for 60 days,"I gave my wife this coffee maker two months ago, and I actually have never used this unit; my wife is the coffee drinker in the family, so I am only passing along what she has told me. Until last week, the Mr Coffee performed well and my wife had no complaints. Unfortunately, in the last week, the coffee maker no longer provides the steam to foam up the milk, and my wife says that the coffee is coming out ""differently"". On the other hand, I do not know if the system is being cleaned as it should be, or if there is any other regular maintenance that needs to be done to it. In any case, the unit has not had heavy use, and I would guess that my wife is representative of an average user, so for this system to fail after 2 months is likely not acceptable. To be honest, I was sceptical of how high the quality could be on an espresso machine for $60, so I am not surprised that it is already providing problems."
1,FALLS APART FAST! Waste of good money.,"Bought this over the summer.Problem 1- Coffee maker- the carafe does not fit properly under the dispenser.Problem 2- Coffee maker- the carafe is poorly designed so you have to pour your coffee over the sink because it spills all over the counter.Problem 3- Coffee maker- makes coffee slooooooowwwwwwwlyProblem 4- Little parts started to bend or break off after 1 month.The espresso maker is ok, but it does take quite a long time to steam the milk.I am now shopping for a new coffee maker and espresso machine. This one has only been used since August.Don't do it!"
3,dribbling Carafe,Dear Mr. Coffee:I really like the idea that I can make regular and espresso coffee on the same coffee pot. Its very convenient not to have to delve into a cabinet to dredge up the espresso machine.The problem is the design of the carafe for the regular coffee. It is impossible to pour without spilling coffee all over the counter or table. Could you correct this please?
3,Doesn't seem to keep the coffee hot and can't get milk to froth,I suppose this is okay for the money. I bought it when it was less than $45.00. The carafe leaks coffee when you pour it - you have to pour very slowly. The coffee does not seem real hot. I think it is the burner that doesn't stay hot because the coffee is hot enough when I first pour it. As for the espresso part - I can't get the milk to froth with the steamer. I have never had an espresso machine so I don't know if they all are like that. I do know at Starbucks the milk is frothed in seconds. I always have to actually let it boil and then there is a little froth but not much. I like it okay because I can make very strong coffee and add my caramel flavoring. I then pour the milk in it and put some coolwhip on top.
1,Mr. Coffee Espresso Machine and Coffeemaker Combo,"On a scale of 1-5 stars, this product should receive zero.After less than one month's use, parts have started to rust. The steamer arm provides little steam; instead large amounts of condensation collect under the lid which runs down the back of the unit each time the lid is opened.On the coffee side, the plastic notches on the lid of the pot are flimsy and have already started to bend and tear, making it difficult to reattach. The lid is an essential part of the coffeemaker, since it starts/stops the coffee flow.I recommend NOT investing in this coffeemaker."
2,It really does leak!!!!,"I read the reviews online and I purchased this machine anyway, bad mistake. Reviewers said ""leaking problems"", I assumed a truly defective unit that leaked maybe from the base of the unit. NO, this unit leaks when you pour from the extremely poorly designed coffee decanter. Lifting the lid when you pour does alleviate this issue, BUT, you will receive a nice steam burn. This coffeemaker does make hot coffee. I'm about ready to go back to my old machine, that makes lukewarm coffee but does pour into the cup without burning me every morning."
2,Cheaply made product,"I bought this product after looking at the reviews but when I brought it home it had several problems. The expresso side of the machine leaked water from the bottom so that I could never get more than one shot of expresso at a time no matter how much water I put in it. The coffee side of the machine works better but the decanter leaks and the top of the decanter is difficult to put on and is also cheaply made, which poses a problem because the top is required in order to ensure that coffee comes out of the coffee maker. If you don't have the top of the decanter, the water will remain in the filter and overflow."
1,mr coffee,"listed as like new, but stop drip on percolator did not work, and espresso tank gradually become non-functional; not worth the price"
5,Excellent for the price,"I have been using the Mr. Coffee Espresso machine and coffeemaker for just over a month now and have had absolutely no problems with it. My past experience with Mr. Coffee has been that the plastic handle tends to break or come loose after a while. This particular design seems to be slightly better, though time will tell...The only issue I had with it was the extremely short wire used to plug into an electrical outlet (12""-18"" only). It has intentionally been designed that way as a security feature but I would have preferred another foot of wire length.Overall I'm very satisfied."
