2,Swingle Singers they ain't,I had many people tell me how wonderful this band was so I was eager to hear the record. Hmmm. I guess a lot is lost in the translation. The music isn't bad so much as disappointing. With all the vocalists and instrumentalists you would have figured they would do more. The songs are OK but nothing is gained by the 20+ band member treatment. Try a little 4 part harmony. I'm not sure how this beats the Langley School Project.Apparently the live show is the real thing...but you don't need a to buy a cd for that.
1,Libel warning,"The review of this book by Manfred Mueller libels me. Please remove it. He states that the book ""exposes the dirty work of quackbusters Stephen Barrett, John Renner, Williams Jarvis etc., and their corporate backers in detail."" In fact, the book is a pack of lies. We sued Lisa and the publisher. The settlement agreement states that if the book is republished, about 20 passages may not be reprinted. The rest of the settlement terms are covered by a nondisclosure agreement."
2,If You Need Info in Print...,... then get this little book. But most all the information can be found online. Do an internet search and you'll find a video of the author going over the same stuff found here.
1,Book is lacking.,"I have read the previous four books in the series. Greeno is a long winded author with scattered plots. The plot in this fifth book no long was realistic nor well planned. It seemed to me that the author was merely trying to write another book in the series instead of having planned anything. In fact, I was not able to finish the book. I will not spend any more time or money on a Gayle Greeno book."
1,Possibly no longer supported by palm,This is a very unstable product. Palm customer service could not even find their own documention for this product.
2,Unstable,"...the performance of this machine is unstable. If you are a user of a hack (a Palm program that can be compared with a TSR of the old DOS - do you remember Sidekick?) or a notification manager program like pToolSet, there is a chance of this program's malfunction. Even after uninstalling pToolSet from my TRG PRO, in a morning, my cradle stopped working without any specific reason. If you can set this machine it up successfully, you can get some convenience from this machine, especially if you have a wireless network like me. But this machine often rejects to work."
3,Fun English Cozy,"This is an English cozy that takes the reader on a meandering walk down mystery lane with all the dignity of an English tea and the adventure of discovery. This is a mystery/romance to read while curled up before a roaring fire while drinking, what else, a bracing cup of tea.Read the entire review at AUTHOR'S CHOICE REVIEWS http://come.to/bookreviews"
5,good read,"I picked this up along with The final Crumpet, new authors to me. I enjoyed it very much, though the beginning was a little slow, once it got going I couldnt put it down.getting ready to read The Final Crumpet - wish there were more books in this series - love a good, cozy English Mystery!"
1,Lots of useless fluff and bad assumptions,"Tommy K.M.F. is absolutely right. This book has A LOT of nonsense in it. It takes ~3 hours to read a chapter (30 pages on average), and most of the knowledge gained is jibberish. Also, the assumptions (as with most Economics book) are a load of bull. Here's an example:Most economists assume more is better. Well, let's say I give Bob 1,000 apples. Economists would say he gets utility from everyone single one.In reality, Bob has to store the apples in his apartment, where they rot before he can eat them all. His girlfriend moves out, because she can't put up with the fruit flies, and he has to pay a cleaning crew to clean out his apartment. Meanwhile, 5 miles south, Jill dies from hunger.I hate economics and the selfishness it teaches."
1,Worst Macro Book Ever...,"This book is horrible. Using it now for a grad school macro class, and the errors in the mathematical appendix, the half-baked ideas expressed in the book and other horrendous items make this book a bad buy. He does not ""drive home"" on many topics in the book. I look forward to burning this book after this class is over. I would much rather recommend Macroeconomics by Bernanke and Abel (.Macroeconomics plus MyEconLab plus eBook 1-semester Student Access Kit (6th Edition)), than this excuse of a book."
4,Good macro text,"This was the assigned text for a class on business cycles. The professor used this text as background and for reading assignments, He followed the general outline of the text and filled in with more mathematical examples and additional details. Were things may have been a bit inconstant we analysed why they were or were not.I feel the text added to the understanding of the course, generally the text was clear and the numerous graphs added greatly to the understanding of the material. I could not see a bias to the text and it's material as some other reviews have stated, it seemed to hit Keynesian, Monetarism, and others. Generally there is far more material in the book than can be covered in a single course. The 4th edition at this point (mid 2011) is very up to date with examples and details from the real world."
2,"Poorly organized, hard to understand","The book alone is not sufficient for effectively mastering the concepts of macroeconomics. I had to purchase a separate study guide, which provided a more detailed and straight to the point explanation of the variables. It's confusing. I have to go over the chapter several times for it to make sense. There are a lot of unnecessary information given throughout the book which I find distracting. The end of the chapter summary and terminologies are not presented in an organized, easy to read fashion, compared to the newer version. Also, I think it would be really helpful if there were practice problems or answers provided in the back."
4,Great fit,"Great fit for MOST of my sons Monster Jam monster trucks. Great to keep them all in one place. Only con so far is that the Mohawk Warrior monster truck has to be put in sideways because of the mohawk sticking up, but it still fits, just not in the same direction as all the others."
5,Great!,This is the second case I got for my son. The first was the Cars case for regular cars and it is such a great ways to organize cars and have them ready to go. After my son started getting Monster trucks I new I have to get him the Monster truck case. Its a great gift or just a nice way to store Monster trucks! My son loves it and now have a choice from two to play with!
5,Great Monster truck storage,This is a well made hard plastic carrying case for Hot Wheels Monster jam trucks. Holds them in place and it's easy to get them in and out. This is the second one I've purchased for my grandson. Great!
5,Nice carrying case,I have this case to my nephew for his birthday. He LOVES monster trucks and carries them everywhere. He absolutely loved this case when he opened it.
4,Hot Wheels Monster Truck Case,This is a very good product to store 15 Hot Wheels Monster Trucks. It is sturdy and strong (my kids can even sit on it)
5,Love it!,This was a great product. My son loves that he can place his trucks in this case and carry it around. It's not heavy even with the trucks inside.
2,Monster jam case,I didn't realize it until Christmas morning that the case was missing the rivits holding the Grave Digger picture on. It was more noticeable since my sone has 2 of them.
4,It's Good,"I am not usually a big fan of remakes, but I like this one. While not a scene by scene remake, it is pretty close. The main differance is in the female lead character turning into a tough character, and the ending which is pretty dark. You can tell it was a labor of love for Savini to make this movie. The zombies all look great, and the gore is good. The making of featurette shows a lot of the cut footage that got this down to an R. The acting is good, and overall the atmosphere is creepy and claustraphobic. All in all, this is a worthy remake, and a good companion to the original black and white version."
3,"Nice Set-Up, Old Translation","While 'Penguin Classics' paperbacks are generally some of the best on the market, the Analects themselves are, in this case, a bit out a date.Better translations have been made, in my opinion. However, the prose itself is well-styled and clearly separated. Concise and easy to understand. The fluency of the book is what seems most troubling."
4,Nice philosophy,"It's amazing how after so many years Confucius thoughts are still important. Here you can find the basis for most of the later philosophists, including some universal principles of most religions. Even though it is not easy to read, with a little effort is a book to enjoy."
3,"Unbelieveably inexpensive, got here fast","Product got here very quickly. Book is in okay shape, good enough for a read once or twice, but not soemthing worth keeping as a reference tool or hierloom. Has some pen marks and notes in it, I don't mind. Incredible cheap, seller did a great job."
3,Quality of printing,The quality of printing of the book (new) I received was rather poor. I kept it just because I didn't want to go through the trouble of returning it.
5,Painters Guide to Design and Composition,Iam very pleased with all the valuable information from so many good artists.
2,A painters guide to design and composition,The book did not present anything new or in a diffrent way. I was very disappointed in the book. I have seen much better books.
3,A good book if you have no other books on composition,"I gave this book a pass as I have better, more substantial book in my art library."
4,Clear and succinct,"This book in written in a way that is easy to look through, find a topic of interest and have it presented with meaningful examples. While perhaps not for an advanced artist I would see where it would be helpful for a weekend painter, beginner or novice or someone getting back into painting. It is easy to understand the concepts and advice in the way it is written."
5,Great Home School Resource,"What a fantastic resource! We home school and my children and I are all very interested in painting. This book goes through the principles of design and composition in a clear, focused, logical and beautifully illustrated manner. It is an art education in a single volume. I bought copies for each of my children. (It also makes a lovely coffee table piece, for those who just want to look at the gorgeous paintings.) Thank you Margot Schulzke and North Light Books!"
4,Dragon Lovers Will Love This Story,"Being a dragon lover and believe that they do exist on some realm it was wonderful to see dragons portrayed as the gentle and thought based creatures they are.This story blew me away and found myself very caught up in the story and could not get away from it. I am the type of person that likes to be read to while my wife love to read to others and be animated and both of us were just captured by the story from the beginning to the end.This is one of the few books that I plan on reading to my kids, it's just that simple."
1,Misrepresented item not useable as shipped.,"WARNING! The picture falsely represents this item as coming with the handheld remote. It does not. You only get the wall receiver, which is useless without a remote transmitter.I notified Amazon about this problem on Mar 28, 2007. The rep stated that the page would be updated, but as of April 8th it is still incorrect."
2,only the receiver,the remote shown on the picture is not included. Only the receiver included. be aware. and it doesn't worth the price.
3,One sided view point,"Larson does show that straw purchasers of handguns contribute to crime. He spends little or no time on the contributing factors for such gun purchases. He does not address guns obtained by theft, or illegal sales or the lending of firearms within extended families, gangs or circles of acquaintances.If your mind is already made up, you'll like this book."
2,too many stats! no real story line,after loving Devil in the White City thought this would be a good choice. reading dry percentages of statistics put me to sleep..
5,Very interesting read...,"Well written book that not only gives you perspective on a school shooting - and by extension, any school shooting - but also on how an assault rifle goes from development to manufacturing to distribution to retail, and then into the hands of a future killer."
4,Important Story,Have read all his books. Larson is a really interesting writer. Didn't know much about guns but now i will pay attention when they are involved in a news story.
4,Reasonable suggestions.,"""Buying a gun should be the most difficult ritual in America, instead of one of the easiest.""Excellent exposition on the gun culture. Reasonable suggestions onkeeping guns out of the wrong hands."
4,WELL WORTH THE EFFORT,"i HAVE JUST FINISHED READING ""MY LADY BELOVED"". i FOUND IT INTERESTING HISTORICALLY, VERY READABLE AND WITH A STORY LINE WHICH FLOWED EXTREMELY WELL. THE HEROINE WAS FEISTY, AND CONCERNED AND FILLED WTIH LOVE FOR HER SISTERS. THE HERO ARROGANTLY BELIEVABLE. I ENJOY MEDIEVAL NOVELS BUT I DON'T ALWAYS FIND THEM ENGROSSING, THIS ONE WAS."
4,my beloved lady,I love anything written my Linda Lael Miller and I was not disappointed with this book. I didn't even want to put it down it was so good. I was hoping that there would be a series on this but can only find one more. What about Elizabeth?
4,"Insight into the developing author of Atlas Shrugged, etc.","As the introduction to this book states, it is not meant for the unseasoned reader of Ayn Rand. This book is meant for people who have read Rand's books and are interested in further writings by this masterful writer or insight into the ealy workings of this great mind. As the introduction also states, Rand wrote most of these plays and short stories never meaning for them to be published. Most of them have little philosophic underpinnings outside of the presentation of heroic characters. This book is a wonderful supliment for people who have read and enjoyed Rand's books and revel in the worlds that she creates. At times the plots of the short fiction presented here are a tad simplistic, but they are fun. A good book if you can't get enough of Rand"
5,There's more?,"Though it's obvioulsy not Atlas or Fountainhead, this is a good read. For anyone who's looking for more Rand Fiction, it's short, interesting, and enjoyable. The style IS in some ways similar to O. Henry, which was an added bonus. Because, hey...I loved O. Henry. Though the book may not be as life altering as some of her others, it is still a very enjoyable collection. (And if you haven't read O. Henry, read him too.)"
1,CompactSSFDC limitations,"This appeared to be an ideal convertor tool from smart media to CF. However, having purchased one, I find from consultation with Pretec that it is limited to a max of 32Mb smart media card - hardly sufficient for many peoples needs today. In addition this is not mentioned on the Amazon description - in fact the implication is that it can support 64Mb cards.A product I wish I had not bought!"
2,Too bulky,"When I got the Pretec Smart Media Compact Flash Card Adapter, I didn't realize how bulky it was. I put in my pocket pc and it stuck out about two inches. I tested it with the Sandisk 32mb Smart Media card and it worked fine. I also tested it with the Viking 64MB Smart Media card, but it wouldn't recognize the card. I decided it wasn't worth it, so I returned it."
3,worked as expected,This product worked as expected. It fit easily into the compact flash slot of my IPAQ 3650. It does stick out almost 1 inch. It isn't anything you would want to leave in place. However it is easy to slip it in and copy my pictures from an Olympus 8 mb flash media card. I remove it when I am done. It saved me from having to get another digital camera because of card incompatibility.
1,Information I've picked up elsewhere,"I didn't buy one of these, but I've seen similar adapters elsewhere on the internet. Descriptions say that they only work with 8mb, 16mb and 32mb SmartMedia cards.Compact Flash cards have their own built-in controller, while SmartMedia cards don't, so the best I can figure is that this is basically a card controller (with a serious design deficiency)."
2,One hit wonder whose capable of better,"Latif burst onto the scene with his great debut CD single, I Don't Wanna Hurt You. I Don't Wanna Hurt should've put Latif on the map but sadly it didn't. The rest of the CD is medicore R&B and I know Latif is better than this."
2,THE AUTHOR MUST WORK FOR THE COMPANY,"ORIGINAL SIN IS A SIN. THE FIRST 100 PAGES OF THIS BORE ARE JUST A WASTE OF TIME. THE BOOK DOESN'T GET GOING UNTIL HALF WAY AND BY THEN THE READER IS PROBABLY COMATOSE. THE ALIENS THEMSELVES ARE HARDLY MENTIONED AND THERE ARE SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AND SITUATIONS THAT ARE TOTALLY STUPID. WHERE DID THE MOTHER ALIEN COME FROM IF THERE REALLY WAS ONE? THE ONLY NEW AND GOOD IDEA I LIKED WAS CONCERNING THE COMPANY AND THE RACE OF BEINGS THAT WERE ON THE DERELICT SHIP. THE REST IS AS OLD AS SIN. I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR THE DIEHARD ALIEN FANS. IF YOU NEED HELP SLEEPING OR WANT TO BORE YOURSELF TO NEW LEVEL THEN THIS IS FOR YOU. THE AUTHOR MUST HAVE WROTE THIS IN A DAY AND HE MUST BE WOKING FOR THE COMPANY TRYING TO KEEP THE ALIENS A SECRET SO THAT READERS WILL STAY AWAY FROM READING FURTHER NOVELS ABOUT THESE FASCINATING CHARACTERS, STORIES AND CREATURES."
4,Very enjoyable.,This makes for a very interesting read for what may have happened after Aliens: Resurrection.I wouldn't pay much attention to the naysayers. None of the Aliens books are going to stretch your brain but as long as they are enjoyable.....
2,Another sub-par effort for the Aliens series,The Aliens story has so much potential to be great but is dragged down by the crappy movies and books. This is by far the worst aliens book I have read so far. The book was extremly boring and aliens didn't show up untill halfway passed the middle of the book. The only thing of interest in the book is the theory of cooperation between a faction from earth and the race of aliens that piloted the spacecraft the eggs where found in from the original movie. If you are a big Aliens fan like I am you will find the book very lacking and dissapointing. Here's a hope that more books will be written that will lean more towards the Colonial Marine encounters with the Xenomorphs.
1,"READ 1ST FEW CHAPTERS, LOST INTREST","I read the first few chapters, and I just lost intrest. It started off boring, and stayed boring. I haven't much else to say. I suppose I'll try to finish the book, however dull it might be, maybe it might pick up."
2,Alien Borefest!,"I really, really, wanted to get into this book - but after halfway thru it - I was left utterly bored. Too bad, too.I liked the last Alien movie, Alien Resurrection, which this novel starts out at. Sure it had its problems, but overall it was a slick action sci-fi movie by a French filmaker. (Maybe that was the problem? Lol!)But this author's writing style didn't capture the essence of this franchise. You need to grab your readers by the throat from the get-go. Unfortunately, it didn't happen here. Nor in subsequent chapters.Being a huge Alien and Predator fan, I was sorely dissappointed.But I see there's a new Predator novel out! I will definately read that and check it out. The synopsis sounds excellent. We'll see..."
2,Utterly hopeless trash-fiction,"I always keep my expectations set very low when reading pulp, sometimes I am pleasantly surprised, but most of the time I am amazed that such crap ever makes it to press. Aliens: Original Sin is one of those occasions. It honestly one of the most boring and uneventful books I have ever sat down and read.Even at a very short 250 pages, with not many words on a page, I found it very slow and without even a single memorable moment. No good action, forgettable characters and no sense of mystery or dread. The ONLY reason I am giving it 2/5 is that is stays true to the Alien lore and doesn't make up its own history like Dark Horse's Predator: Forever Midnight, which seems like Charles Dickens in comparison to this tripe.Do not buy this book."
1,No Thank You,"MJ Friedman attempts to continue the ALIENS franchise where the last movie RESURRECTION left off. Well, maybe that wasn't such a good idea. The author tries to give more back story to the Space Jockey race from the original film ALIEN but really creates more questions than substance. I'm glad to see that this Vol. 1 was never expounded upon and feel this was because the writer fumbled the chance to garner interest in his weak plot frame. Not a fan of this one and it really isn't worth the time as it is merely a prolonged epilogue to ALIEN RESURRECTION."
4,Excellent read for an Aliens Fan,"Great read for any scifi/horror fan, a very decent storyline and continuation from where Alien Resurrection left off. Excellent story, characters were perfect. More books like this should be written."
5,The Best Mushroomhead Yet!!!,"I can not stop listening to this cd!! This is the best Mushroomhead yet!! It gets you crazy and leaves you begging for more!! If you are a fan, this cd is a MUST HAVE!!"
4,They're back :),this is the follow up to XXX and it builds upon the sucess of the last album. all the tracks rock and I love what the band did with seal's crazy. I pre ordered it and was rewarded for doing so by reciving and autographed copy of the album. i have not put the disc in my computer to check out the videos and other stuff but I hear it great as well. this cd has not left my cd player in the car yet. I hope they tour in my area soon. these guys kick....[butt]
5,TOTALLY AWESOME CD!!!!!!!!!!1,"Any fan of Mushroomhead's first album will LOVE their sophomore release. ""Sun Doesn't Rise"" is an amazing song! And if you think that rocks, wait until you hear the others! Awesomeness! I RECOMMEND THIS CD TO EVERYONE!"
5,No Sophomore Jinx Here!,"This is one of those CDs that creeps up on you--the more you listen to it, the more you love it. Every time I listen, I hear something new that totally blows me away. Easily the best release of 2003. BUY THIS CD!!!!!"
5,This Review Rocks,What more could I possibly say about the album it explains itself in every possible aspect. The beats and melodies of the entire album is awesome.XIII is the best album ever offered to us.
2,well....,okay well u see i live around a ton of people who absolutely LOVE this band and well i dont exactly understand why they're so great. okay so they can use synthesizers and put in beats...well yeah so can i with a good keyboard and drum set. it all comes down to well their vocals suck. it is SO monotone and not even on a real note. i can stand listening to them for about a total of 5 minutes but my ears can only take so much off pitch screeching. the fact is who cares if slipknot or mushroomhead started doing stuff first..slipknot is just more sucessful because they are easier to listen to and have catchier songs. if you have ever listened to the end of bwomp you understand that any man that sings like that should NOT be considered a decent vocalist.
5,Mushroomhead - XIII,"This cd is great! Where Mushroomhead left off with XX, they picked up 50 steps ahead and in even better shape. This album is dark and very interesting. Great, clean sounds all the way through. Especially on ""Sun Doesn't Rise""."
5,Shroomhead delivers!,"This is by far the best collection of music Mushroomhead has ever done. From beginning to end, this album is awesome and keeps the listener inerested. I like Slipknot too, but Mushroomhead is more dynamic in their music. Buy it!"
4,XLent shi'ite,"An extremely intense compilation of hard-hitting lyrics and harmonious melodies...ok, enough verbage...it's just a badass album and every song is excellent in a totally unique way. If you love your ears, you'll buy this album..."
5,'shroomhead XIII rocks!,"This is currently one of my favorite albums. The music is hard and forceful on almost all tracks. The lyrics alternate between thoughtful and aggressive. My favorite thing about this album is that there are very few slow tracks. It pretty much stays heavy throughout. I offen listen to the whole thing, without skipping any of the tracks."
1,Awful excuse of mallcore.,"This is just another pathetic excuse of an albumand yes they are nu metal (just like the rest of the 110% nu metal), mushroomhead and this albumis as dull as it comesLong Live Real MetalDeath to nu metal."
1,wow...,"my friend showed me this album and this guys just went from suck to suckier wow i can't see a band this bad signed this bands like Slipknot, Mudvayne and Mushroomhead are just pure crap or Murderdolls trying to be the gothic thing when they are just crap"
5,mushroomhead xiii,"WOW....this cd is awesome. Now a days theres so many crappy bands. Most bands have no telent. There is nothing but crap out there today. But thats when you turn to bands like mushroomhead. This band is packed with talent. This cd defintly shows it. This cd is a masterpice. Its so raw and heavy. Yet its melodic at the same time. Its pure brilliance. I say if you are sick of all those no talent crap bands that we all have been listning to, defintly go pick this cd up. I gaurentee that you wont be dissapointed. This cd is a nessecity"
5,Much Better,"This CD is a vast improvement upon XX. XX had an original sound, unfourtunately, that sound was mediocre at its climax. This CD however just seems to fit together perfectly; no song seems out of place and individual songs are just - better. If you've heard Mushroomhead before, then you know what I am talking about. In XX there were awkward speed changes throughout songs, parts of songs that just werent appealing, and the CD completely lacked flow. If you haven't heard them yet, I strongly suggest you do, and I strongly suggest you start with this CD. Even if you dont consider yourself a metal fan, you will appreciate what these guys are doing."
5,the best CD from mushroom head yet,"ok all you MUSHROOMHEAD fans here it is the new XIII CD from the greatest band in the world,MUSHROOMHEAD. this CD is jampacked full of hardcore music wile stich with his magic hands puts that little bit of techno to the songs. If you notice that SK the band who has fallen off the earth is a rip off you r a true fan and hope you have the cd. the best track on the cd to me, that is myself, or I as im called is the 7th track ""The Dream IS Over"" its alot of J-man with his ohhh god his voice is so great gerrrrr ok well to the point now this cd is a must have its beats are great the singing is the best all aorund its a 10 not a 5"
5,MRH Xlll CD,"Received a broken CD. Had my account re-imbursed, ordered another Cd, and received it two days later. Arrived in great shape. Overall I would have to give props for the great customer service. I wouldn't hesitate to order from Amazon.com again."
3,bought it...hated it...,"well i checked this band out because i heard about their feud with slipknot(whom i dispise). well i gotta tell ya, from all the whining these losers do, they sure as hell can't actually play. this sounds like a bunch of noises just pasted together. my suggestion to these guys is to spend less time whing about slipknot, and more time getting their sound down. i give it a 3 for creativity."
1,Garbage,"Maybe Mushroom head should worry less about their mask and image, and concentrate more on learning how to play a their instruments. I have never heard a metal band that was so horrid in my life. All Mushroom Head does is whine through every song with some easy power chords to go along with it. These guys are nothing that you havent heard a million times before, and they are just plain bad. How anyone can like this is beyond me, even if you love Nu Metal, there are so many bands from that genere that blow these guys out of the water. If you are aching for some good Nu Metal, then try Machinehead, Mudvayne, (older) Slipknot, or DevilDriver."
1,Intentionally Altered Meanings,"Several passages are paraphrased in a way that their meanings are totally off-base. For one example, look at Matthew 18:17.Proper translations:""...But if he refuses to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector."" New King James Version""...and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector."" New International VersionThe Message:""...If he won't listen to the church, you'll have to start over from scratch, confront him with the need for repentance, and offer God's forgiving love.""In case you were wondering, Jesus' audience would have treated a heathen/pagan or a tax collector as an outcast/outsider or a traitor. I have no idea how Peterson came up with ""start over...confront...and offer God's forgiving love"". As a high school English teacher, I would not accept this as a proper paraphrase from my teenage students. It's actually quite pathetic, in my humble opinion."
1,Lip-synch,"Sorry, but no.The scenary is grandiose, but I want to listen to ""live"" opera. Why were they wearing microphones? Would you believe they were really singing? C'mon? The editing is a disaster. There are no subtitles (as said previously). Nevertheless I must admit that the director has balls to allow this DVD to be released."
5,RV plug,I bought this to hook up my RV and also connect my generator to my house when the power is out. Works great and easy to wire.
5,Does what is is supposed to.,It was very easy to wire and the large handle makes it simple to plug and unplug.Seems durable enough.
4,Good replacement plug -- but....,"Plug is solid and easy to install & use. I'll keep it. But be aware that if you're replacing a plug on the cable that extends from your RV, this plug will not fit into a standard 3"" electric cable hatch/door. You'll have to install a much larger hatch in order to recess this plug into your RV. The plug is about 5"" across. Best price I can find on a replacement hatch big enough to accommodate this plug is around $30."
3,Functional with idiotic design,"When you take the two halves apart, you'll find the terminal screws are horizontal, and lined up below the rim of the piece they're inside. So you cannot get straight at them with a screwdriver. In the package I received, 2 of the 4 terminal screws had worked themselves loose and fallen out. It was quite difficult to get the ""hot"" one back in because of this. There was maybe 2 mm clearence between the screw head and the casing. I had to twist it into place very tediously by hand until it was threaded in, then twist it by hand for a while until the screw was far enough in to get a thin screwdriver into it (off-angle, of course). The seam between the two halves should be BELOW the line of the screws. What an idiotic design flaw for something that should be so simple."
3,product is not same as picture,this product is not as the picture shows. it was a 3-prong plug. I returned the item and amazon shipped a second one to me that was also three prong. Now i know the model 55245 is a 3 prong plug. I have ordered model 55255 and hoping it comes as the 4-prong plug that i need.
2,Worked but....,"I am a woman that RV's a lot and had trouble getting a good grip on my cord and pulling it off the electrical box. So I thought this was going to be the best solution. I cut the plug off my electrical cord, and easily installed this one. Works great but....now with the handle attached, the plug won't fit out the electrical cord exit hole on my coach. So I have to leave the access door open, and get rain and snow inside the electrical compartment, which is ruining the lining inside. I should of bought an adapter with a handle on it..."
2,Cheaply constructed,"I bought these because they looked user friendly for non-electrician types and the best thing about this product was some very outstanding instructions. The wiring was a little tricky and despite tightening the screws as tight as possible, the wires keep slipping out. Finally got to work by cutting them back a little farther. The two screws at the base hold the cord into place and are cheap - easy to wallow out as only the plastic hold them in place. I substituted two longer screws with nuts to hold in place. Overall, hour or two job to install male and female versions of these took twice as long. Knowing what I know now, I'd probably just buy the Home Depot versions, which don't have the handle, but are more sturdy and probably a lot safer."
1,This is NOT a standard RV 30 amp plug which has 3 prongs,This is NOT a standard RV 30 amp plug. The standard outlet at RV campsites accepts a 3 prong plug which has one round and two flat/angled blades - NOT the 4 blades that this item has. Those who purchase this item thinking that their RV's electric will plug into an outlet at an RV campsite is going to be disappointed.
4,Best one I have found so far,"pros:handle is REAL nice when traveling for plug/unplug frequentlyyellow is easy to see, and it is VERY easy to replace plug with this one.This may seem simple and is with THIS one,but somehow others position the few parts in such a way as to make it difficult. Also some of the others have plastic housing so brittle that it tends to break in the installing process.This one will not.con:only 1 and that is that it will still eventually wear out due to frequent use. The plastic near the prongs becomes brittle from heat and it quits working. Keep in mind that we live in our RV 365 days a year and in all fairness it still way outlasts the others."
3,There is no confusion here,"The books description is exactly what the book is about, I see no reason for any type of confusion with ""Russ Schneider"" or his fictional works. That being said the book is nothing special, small histories of six different 'sieges' the Germans found themselves in, but honestly nothing too memorable is presented, at least in my opinion."
3,Interesting but too expensive,"This is an overall interesting book on a series of siege battle during the WW II. Author's presentation is good but definitely not brilliant and there is no particular new information you can encounter. If it were a relatively economical paperbook version, I would be willing to recommend the book to anybody interested in the WWII.But, it's unreasonably expensive like anyother WW II books published by JJ Fedorrowicz."
2,A bit light ...,"""Siege"", despite its title and the titles of the chapters isn't an historical study of some of the less known - the author claims - ""sieges"" of WW2.It's an entertaining overview of such events, heavily based on German-biaised sources and witnesses. It's an interesting book for the military buff and ""eastern fronts fanatics"" but some elementary infos are lacking such as the OB's.It's not mere propaganda as P. Carell but it suffers from the ""Eastern Front through German eyes"" syndrome. two examples : first, the lack of infos about the fate of Budapest civilians, especially Jews, in the corresponding chapter, with the exception of a few sentences about atrocities committed ... by the Soviets ! Second, the photographs mostly show German officers and troops. For the Budapest chapter, there is only German leaders, not even a picture of Malinovsky !H.H."
2,"confusion - which ""siege"" is it?","The cover of this book looks almost exactly like ""Siege"" by Russ Schneider. It would be very easy to mistake which one a reader was buying - until you start reading. While this is a very dry non-fiction review, Schneider's book is an exciting novel based on the facts of several of the same sieges. Give Schneider's a whirl if you want in depth descriptions and stories based on memoires and letters."
5,I love this series,I've enjoyed this series and finally broke down and started ordering it one year at a time. I'll be having a Law & Order CI party one of these days.
3,Given as a gift,"A gift for my wife on Christmas Day so we have not viewed it yet, but she loves the program."
3,I Can't Get Into It... I Wish I Could,"I'm a self proclaimed Law and Order junkie. I've been watching the regular Law and Order ever since my mom started letting me, and when SVU came on, I became a huge fan. And then CI came on, and I was ecstatic! Yay, more Law and Order. And... I'm sadly no that impressed. I've tried watching it a bunch of times, and I just can't get into it like the other 2. I hate myself for this, because it's not as though it's badly acted or written... I just... don't really like it. However, I will still give this set 3 stars because Vincent D'Onfrio is amazing... and it's Law and Order, come on."
2,GREAT SHOW! BEST SPIN OFF!,Great show with some great performances by Vincent D'Onofrio and the rest. Really great directing.
1,Its Already Been Done,"I liked this series better when it was called, Columbo, and starred Peter Falk."
5,The best Law and Order of them all CRIMINAL INTENT,I am a major Law and Order Criminal Intent fan. I love the original cast they all play off each other superbly. The two original leads are the best on all Law and Order shows even though the female lead on SVU is also the best.
5,22 episodes of a great show,"Although the episodes of Law and Order: Criminal Intent bear much similarity to each other, this show never gets old for me. This show stars Vincent D'Onofrio, made famous as the human form of the cockroach alien in Men in Black, as detective Robert Goren. In every episode, at least one murder has occured and it's up to the major case squad to track down the killer and get him to confess, while barely refraining from illegally harassing the suspects.The show centers around the mental states of the killers, and is very interesting for anyone fascinated by the psychology involved in criminal justice. This show will expose you to the criminal mind so much, that eventually you might start thinking like one. By the time you finish watching this whole season, you'll have figured out how to perform the perfect murder without getting caught."
5,WHERE IS SEASON 2???,"This is the best show ever. Incredible actors, amazing writing, and top quality directing. This is the best of everything. The DVD set gives insight about the show, which helps the viewer understand the ideas behind the choices and the backstage of the show a bit better. I highly recommend Criminal Intent, both season 1 and 3. And I ask the obvious question, where is season 2, not to mention all other seasons so far???"
3,seemed like a used product/1 disc scratched,"There were no issues with shipping, but when I got my package, this item was really beat up. It almost seemed like it was a used item that was re-shrink wrapped. That is no big deal since the price was right. The big deal is that the 3rd disc was in bad shape. it had some kind of oily film on it and has little scratches on the edge of the disc. It skips a little bit which is very annoying but I'm not going to send the whole set back just for one disc. :/"
5,answer me this,I really love the show be can't find season two...can someone please tell me why isn't season two available
1,Poor Quality,The book as of poor qualit. It was dirty and torn and the record that came with it was broken. Our refund did come in a timely manner however.
4,Trust me,"I was a little worried about buying this game due to the mixed reviews on this website. I found the official site for the game which to do that i googled the keyword Halo and when I went to their website you can download a free trial consisting of 1 single player mission and 1 online multiplayer level. I'm not one of those next gen gamers looking for the best graphics in the world, and these ARE NOT the greatest graphics in the world but their enough to have a fun time. All in all this is a fun game with awsome online capabilities. This is definently a buy."
4,Worth $20,"Halo is one of the most hyped games in all history. First we had the pre-Microsoft hype, then we had the Microsoft hype, then we had the hype from all the fanboys who loved this game. I recently had the chance to play Halo all the way through after buying it here on Amazon for $20. It's a very fun single-player FPS, with serviceable, but not fabulous, multiplayer. For $60 this game is a total rip-off with its save points and other console-y frustrations, but for just $20, it's a bargain you can't afford to miss."
3,Fun Game - Nothing new...,"If you've played quite a few shooters this one is not anything ground-breaking. It has a great storyline that is fun to participate in - but it is strictly linear: you have no control over what you're doing... again not a big shocker for most shooter games. The gameplay is the same: shoot the bad guys, get to a certain point, save the world (or in this case the universe)... Using the new weapons, alien technology, and some other interesting anemities creates a different atmosphere but I've played this game a lot before.If you've played Call of Duty by Activision - stick to that game, you're not missing anything with Halo.I've read many hardware problems experienced and I have to shrug in confusion: the game doesn't even flinch on my system and the system isn't anything special. Make sure all your drivers are updated, your Windows OS is updated (including any directx updates), and disable any unneeded background programs...Take care!"
2,Don't be fooled,"I admit the game is addictive for Xbox, but for PC, it doesn't even come close. Lets start with the story-line, I will give you one word bad. Graphics, are better for PC if your computer has a very expensive video & sound card. The only new thing added to the PC version is a flying vehicle. The Single-player has a few missions which are long and boring, and the ,Multi-player is ok, if ur computer has good upgrades. Like I said before don't be fooled its not all that good."
4,Entertaining game.,"It is a fun ""first person"", shooter game. The graphics are decent and the story line's ok. The game's play time is about 15 - 20 hours."
4,"An ewesome game, but it has issues","I recently bought this game and I love it. Good music, even better weapons, and the vehicles are really cool. But, there was an issue with my video card, a 64MB ATI 9000. It said that the game was known to have serious issues with the drivers on the card, even though I have the most recent ones. It gave me the option to play in ""safe"" mode, so I did. However, this made the maps look really funny, as these blocks of red stripes kept appearing everywhere. I then tried normal mode, but my machine, a 1 Ghz AMD Athlon, just kept freezing up. Those of you with older video cards, beware."
3,Halo: on pc very average,not as good as xbox but its still a fair game. but dont go out and buy it on pc go buy an xbox instead you will get more for your money.
2,WTF,"Jesus, thank you very much MS for ruining HALO. For those who don't know, Halo was originally a game being developed for PC until Microsoft needed a trophy game to launch it's XBox console. So instead of being original (God forbid) they do what they do best. They bought out a company developing a much anticipated game called HALO (the company's name was Bungie). Well, the fruits of their labor have finally paid off to the PC market close to 3 years LATER. The graphics are very tell-tale that it is a console port, the sound is like listening to an old walkman, even with high machine specs it runs slow and choppy. Thanks MS, you've done it again. I'm taking my copy back to GameStop."
1,Steer Clear,"To put it plain and simple, Halo is about the worse fps I've played. Normally I love first person shooters but this one didn't even deserve 10 minutes of play time. I started the single player mode and I ended with the single player mode about 30 minutes later. To start out with, the graphics really are lame. Even with all the settings maxed the graphics reminded me of the 1999 Deus Ex wich had bad graphics for it's time. Next, the AI (or lack there of) is really pitiful. It consisted of sometimes running away. That's about it. The person with the bigger and faster gun wins. That happens to always be you. The story leaves something to be desired also. I'm glad I didn't pay money for this pitiful excuse of a game. Get UT 2004 instead for online play and wait for HL 2 for single and multiplay."
2,Not all that great,"Halo for pc is not only outdated, but not very fun. There is no strategy at all involved, and its a very repeditive shooter. There is MASSIVE backtracking in most of the levels that makes you go through hallways youve already seen to flip a swich. Eventually it gets extremely boring when you are wandering through the same grey room filled with enemies for the 50th time. The game just isnt very fun. It was bad on the Xbox and now its bad on the PC. If you really want to play it for some reason wait untill it costs less than $15. Untill then just avoid it."
5,"If you can't get the reg. XBOX Halo, get Halo PC!","When my friend rented Halo then started to tell me about it, I knew that I would want to play it. It took me a day or so to get used to the controls, but then he had to return it. A week later he bought it, and after another week, we had beaten the game together. We have now beaten the entire game on all the difficulties three times, working on our fourth.I don't have an XBOX, so I was overjoyed to hear what my mom had gotten me for my birthday... she had preordered Halo PC! Judging by Halo, I am certain that Halo PC will be at least as good. Me and my friends are adiment Halo fans, you can even check out my site,[website] I hope my reveiw was helpful!"
5,WOW!,"I have to admit, they did a very very good job goign from XBOX to PC. You would need a good video card though to get the best graphics, but it works good enough for me. You might have to tweak it a bit before the FPS become at a stable rate with smooth graphics. This game is very fun with the new multi online, even thought you might get laggy a bit. Over all, I have to hand it to Bungie and Gearbox, nice job guys. I will be waitin for HALO 2 on XBOX"
3,Halo didn't fulfill my expectations,"I remember the big hype about Halo, when it was released. I would have bought it right away if my machine had fufilled the minimum requirements. Lucky me, I had to wait until now and could get the game for a low price. Here is why:The graphics are not great. Even for the time Halo was released, the textures are not too detailed and the landscape looks like cut from cardboard. Unreal did almost as well in 1998. The story is good enough with three parties, each stiving to achieve their own goals. Also, the use of vehicles makes the game some fun. But the rather lame and very linear construction of the levels don't live up to the possibilities.Multiplayer might be great with MODs, otherwise it is just slow and boring.It was ok for 10 bucks, but I recommend to get something better (e.g. Far Cry, Max Payne)."
4,Halo: Combat Evolved,"As an avid FPS fan, I found this game to be quite enjoyable. Inclusion of Coop Mode would have added to this game immensely. Multiplayer gaming is about what you would come to expect from any of the current FPS Multiplayer games available. I do like the added customization for multiplayer and the added vehicles and weapons are wonderful.I found the Multiplayer aspect lent itself better to LAN gaming that Internet. But either were entertaining. If you followed the Marathon Series of Games, this is a natural progression."
2,Diapointment,"This game make s me very very sad!! I will start by saying that i had high hopes for this one but system requirments are way above the ones that shown on a box. I have a good computer and in order for the thing to run properly or close to normal i have to bring video to its lowest so graphics start to look realy bad and eventhan it is slow like its freaking 10 years old compare to MOHAA and other games this dosn't even come close. Although game itself is somewhat interesting, desing is very uninspired but battles are fun and vechicles are good to. But in some rooms I have trouble guessing if I was in same room or i came from somwhere else.Basicly this game sucks realy bad so buy ""Call of duty"" instead. The only reason i gave a two star is the nice story everything else is diapointing. THE END."
1,A Big No Go.,"I have heard quite a bit of hype about Halo this and Halo that. So I got it. And much like several other reviewers on this board, I had graphics difficulty from minute one. My system is pretty good, MS XP, 3.06GHz P4, 1 GB RAM, 128MB Radeon 9800. I run Doom 3 at pretty decent levels as well as Call of Duty and other fairly new games. So there just isn't any excuse for the ridiculously slow graphic performance I got. I don't know if the problem is the game's engineering or what, but I am disappointed."
2,A very over-rated game,"I have friends at work that have been talking about how great this game is for some time now (x-box version), so I have been eagerly awaiting it's arrival on PC. If the last first person shooter you played is the original Doom, then Halo will seem like a big improvement. All I can say is save your money and download the Unreal Tournament 2003 demo instead. In my opinion, every aspect of UT2003 is better than Halo (graphics, excitement, sound etc.). In addition, I am running this game on a fairly maxed out system with an AMD 2500+ overclocked to 3200+ stats and a Radeon 9700 Pro graphics card and the game chugs when there is too much action on the screen. This should not be the case on a game that is pretty much 2 years old."
3,cant get it to work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is a good game but............i cant get it to work on my or any of my friends computers. you need a powerful computer with 1.2 gb of memory. this why i gave it 3 stars. but i have played the xbox and would recommend the xbox version or halo 2 for xbox instead. if you have a ps2 get killzone instead of any of these it rocks all hell. it totally beats these titles:half life, half life 2, call of duty,battlefield 1942, battlefield vietnam,unreal tournament 2004 and 2003.so get killzone instead of any of these but this is still good."
2,Don't waste your money on it.,"They have you on a go-cart track. You have to do a certain thing, go a certain way. The game has very good graphics. The game is a lot like Call Of Duty. You would be better off buying Battle Field 2."
3,"Creative but too long, repetitious, and difficult","Halo has a creative plot, some interesting sets, cool weapons and aliens.But this game is way too long and repetitious. It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner. I made the mistake of playing the game at the ""difficult"" level rather than ""normal"". Some of the chapters are extremely difficult where you have to kill hundreds of aliens before you get to save the game at a checkpoint. If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ...I recommend playing this game at the ""normal"" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun."
4,"Great Game, PC Platform adds a lot","This game is just as fantastic as it was on XBOX, except even better. The PC allows you to customize so much more, and this version adds some better graphics particles."
4,"great, simple game","its just halo from the original xbox, simple, fun, competitive. the online works greatonly thing bad is its an old game but thats not really a factor for me"
2,Diapointment,"This game make s me very very sad!! I will start by saying that i had high hopes for this one but system requirments are way above the ones that shown on a box. I have a good computer and in order for the thing to run properly or close to normal i have to bring video to its lowest so graphics start to look realy bad and even than it is slow like its freaking 10 years old computer.

But in some rooms of the game I have trouble guessing if I was in same room or i came from somwhere else.Basicly this game sucks realy bad so buy ""Call of duty"" instead. The only reason i gave a two star is the nice story everything else is diapointing. THE END."
1,Medal of Honor is better than Halo,"I finished playing Halo. Not the greatest of games. I just started playing Medal of Honor, Breakthrough add-on. This game rocks! Medal of Honor is way better than Halo. Not to mention I can crank up the video settings and have it run excellent. On Halo, I have it turned down and it still runs choppy. And the minimum requirements are a 733? Go buy Medal of Honor."
1,Great FPS for its time...,"But releasing it so late for the PC makes it an unworthy competitor to today's top FPS games like UT2003/Unreal 2, America's Army: Operations, the upcoming AA: Special Forces, and other FPS games.Halo multiplayer is also extremely flawed. In Blood Gulch, good banshee pilots will simply start spawn killing and the opposing team won't be able to get a foothold in the battle (CTF).Or worse, you have team killers who also ruin the fun.The banshee and warthog interface isn't what I expected.If they used the Descent engine for the Banshee, and Rallisport Challenge for the Warthog, then it'd be one heck of a game.Overall, it's not worth the money to buy this game since it's already 2 years old. Save your money for something up to date and more fun."
2,Bad port...,"XBox version is unbelievable, but when it reached PC it seems Bungie forgot to compensate for the higher resolutions. Running it at anything higher than 800x600 caused considerable lag, and I have an FX5900 Ultra! This is NOT supposed to happen with ANY game played on this card. Anxiously I await a good patch. AND, WTF HAPPENED TO COOPERATIVE GAMEPLAY??? The moral of the story, this game kicks ass but its technology seriously lacks for PC."
1,Warning: No co-operative play,Halo PC was a Christmas present from Santa. My boys love co-operative play on the X-box - it is their main way of playing all the First Person Shooters. So we were severely disappointed that it was missing from the PC version.What was the point of two licenses if they can't play together?
2,What's so great about it?,"Here comes,the very long awaited,HALO!!!BOOOOM!its over,its gone...I can't beleive that i wasted so much money for this!The quetion is,what's good about this game??I've played great games like Medal of Honour,Call of Duty,Warcraft etc.But this game sucks.Ok,the graphics are great,but couldn't Microsoft think of the magic words 'Fun and Exciting'?The company has created award winning games like Age of Empires,AOM etc.But this one is at the bottom of the list.Don't waste your money on it."
2,Halo is OK--if it works at all...,"First off, my computer is three years old. It was a reasonably high end computer in its day as well. But this release is also three years old, so it *should* run fine.It doesn't. It crashes often. Unless I turn all the graphics way down it runs verry slowly. In contrast, Unreal Tournament 2004 with its flashy graphics and sound runs fine on my computer.The level design isn't great, but the enemy AI is worse. Sometimes you can shoot a line of baddies one at a time with a sniper rifle and they won't budge.Stay away from MicroSoft if you can."
2,Don't let this happen to you.,"I have a Pentium 4 2.8 GHz, a GeForce 5900 FX 256 MB, and 512 MB of RAM. Apparently I'm exactly the sort of person that Gearbox HATES. I have to run this at an atrocious 800x600 to get remotely smooth 30fps performance. And even if I turn all of the bells & whistles on and set everything up to max and it become a 12 frames per hour slideshow, the graphics STILL don't even come close to the quality of the Xbox version. Very disappointing. I was looking forward to playing Halo with mouse/keyboard support and better graphics. It simply isn't happening. I'll stick to my Xbox for now, thanks."
1,Framerates are killing me!!!!,"First off, I lowered the res, lowered the textures, the game can hit 60 fps, if you run it at 640 x 480, with the textures low and the rest of the settings off. I even lowered anisotropic filtering on my card settings, it made some difference.This game should NOT be more GPU and CPU intensive as a game like Morrowind. I'm sorry whatever argument you can come up with won't justify the terrible optimization that went along with this game.It's the new standard in videogame production these days. Concern yourself with graphics and the rest comes later. Let's gouge the people by making games super graphic intensive that they have to go out and buy $500(Can) or $200(US) worth of a videocard.This computer age is just barbaric, it's really good what we can do, but it's nothing more than strong-arm tactics.Xbox owners feel proud, your $500(Can), $200(US) system lets you play games that are optimized properly."
4,Alot Better than Halo 2.,I think this game is cool because this game won over like 48 Game of the Year awards since 2001 when it was first launched on the X-Box and then Rereleased on the PC. The reason why I said this is alot better than Halo 2 because I think the first one is alot better because it's alot longer and Halo 2 is kind of short and a friend of mine said Halo 2 wasn't all that good and I think he's right because Halo: Combat Evolved is alot better than Halo 2 so if you guys are wanting to buy a Halo game buy the 1st one and plus they are making a Halo 3 for the X-Box 360 so it may take awhile but do not Buy Halo 2!
3,Good but Could Have Been Been Better,"I purchased the Halo : Combat Evolved for the PC and played the game throughout one entire campaign. I enjoyed the game but some of the levels were repetitive. Regarding multiplayer play, I would imagine that if you had a private server it would be fun, but the public groups/servers were terrible. (Usually childish dweebs running hacks..sigh..groan) I believe the lack of a cooperative multiplayer campaign to be a significant flaw. While decent story, gameplay, music, sound bytes, and graphics, it is not worthy of a $40+ price tag. Other reviewers have expressed this sentiments more eloquently, I wanted to contribute to the group. On my scale of $0 - $50, it is about $25 including shipping."
3,mmmmm...,"This game was an XBox classic. the transformation to computer leaves some to be desitrd. the missions are GREAT, but the main reason many people bought it was to play multiplayer online, as the original Halo only supported direct lan hookups, and no XBL. the multiplayer DEFINITLEY needs teamspeak, or an equivilent option. you just cant afford to stand still and type a message and risk being shot in the head. that is my main objection, but also the gameplay over the internet is somewhat reduced by the TREMENDOUS LAGGGGGG! I might be bias, because i live in alaska, but it seems that way to me."
4,pretty good,"halo is a very fun game, but there are a few problems with it. it doesn't have coop, which was a great feature on the xbox. and also, the people online are sometimes jackasses. you can ban/kick them, but you need to make the ""Target"" in halo's propertys to ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Halo\halo.exe"" -console and then you can activate the console by hitting ` and you need to type in sv_players then see the offending players ""number"" at the right side of the screen, then type in sv_ban that persons number ,so anyways, if you like FPS then get halo."
2,"Halo PC ""all hype for now!""","I expected great things from the best console FPS ever made, but the PC version sucks! I have a Pentium4 2.8c, 512 of dual channel ddr400, FX5600 ultra, and SATA WD HD. I can hardly get 20 frames per second in certain areas. I have to set everything on its lowest settings in 800x600 to have a solid frame rate. I think the xbox version looks cleaner than the pc version during these settings. Very disappointed in Microsoft, bungie, gearbox and who ever wants to put there name on this product because they had all the time in the world to make a solid pc version but failed. Do not buy this knowing that you can't return it unless you know it will run perfect on your system."
2,I hate this game,"Bungie really pulled this game out of their ass. Multiplayer sucks and everything about the game lags and I'm on a brand new system. It lacks so many necessary features for an online pc game. The only fun part is the vehicles, and that's only when it's not lagging so bad."
1,Buy The Xbox Version!,"I think the PC Version of Halo sucks man because if this version is going to be online play then I guess you might have to pay fees when you are playing this game on the Computer, Then I guess I'm going to say no to this game then!"
1,What was the big deal?,"I bought the game, based on all the hype about H3 and H2 for Vista. It was OK, but frankly, HL, a game of the same era was more interesting. Maybe I am just jaded by the current generation of games such as HL2 EP2 or BioShock. In any case, OK for an older game, just don't pay much for it at this point in its existance."
1,"Not Happy with this product, Halo: Combat Evolved, did not work","This game did not work on my computer. It is not enough money to send it back, so it's just sitting in a drawer. Unsatisfied with this product."
1,Disappointed....must have been better for Xbox,"I have been waiting for awhile to play Halo because I don't own a Xbox.My friends haven't shut up about the game since it came out. I even consider buying a Xbox just for the game. So, once I started playing the very first stage I was immediately disappointed in the game play. EXTREMELY SlUGGISH!!! So, I set all video setting to the minimal and I experienced a very slight improvement. Well, you must be thinking that my PC must a little dated. It's not the top of the line but it is a P4 2.8Ghz, 1 gig of ram, and GeForce 5200, and with all current drivers. I spent several hours to get the game to run faster but nothing worked. If games like Call of Duty and Half-Life 2 run just fine on my PC, there is definitely a problem with the PC format of Halo. Don't waste your money...just rent or buy a Xbox if you really want to play the game. I'm surprise that Microsoft has difficulty making a game that runs fine with Windows."
3,games ok i gues,Well This game runs great on my system but thats just the demo...To gamers who dont like campers very well..i wouldnt get this game...In the demo theres people who grab the banshee and circle around the spawn points not letting anyone get weapons or giving them a chance to fire back
5,Works Fine For Me!,"I have been eagerly waiting to play Halo since it was released for the XBox... I've loved Bungie since the good old days of Myth. In fact, I almost bought an Xbox just to play it...I was a little nervous from all the bad buzz... so imagine how I felt when I loaded it, started it up... and it didn't work at all!!!!You know what though? All it took was updating my graphic card driver on nvidia.com. The game runs fine, looks great... and I don't even have that powerful of a system (p4 1.8, 500 ram, 32 meg video card)...Anyway... this game is simply one of the defining moments in gaming history. It's incredible... so much fun. The vehicles are great, the gameplay is fantastic... it looks beautiful... even running at 30 FPSI haven't tried multpiplayer, so I can't speak to that... but the rest is fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great Game,"I dont know what is these people are doing rong but i have yet to have a problem with halo. The graphics are beutifull and the only time the game gets the slightest bit slow is a rare ocasion on single player. I have no lag on multi player and all the graphics options are set to the max. It dosent quite come head to head thoe with xbox's single player, but on xbox you don't get the online play. I would recomend this game to anyone who can meet the requirements, at least for the online play.P.S. My computer isn't anything speacial eather. Just 2.4 GHz processor 256 ram and a radeon graphics card. It playes this game as good or better than othe games."
4,Awesome!,"This game is amazing! If you have 256 MB RAM and a good Graphics Card, you're all set. In my opinion, it's the best game in the whole series."
4,"Xbox game hits PC, finally.","First off, I have read tons of reviews that say this game will not run on their high-end CPU. Bull crap. This game runs fine on my 2.3 MGhz Pentium 2. Just wanted to clear that up.The single-player is okay, not the best i've ever played. The AI is iffy, there's no co-op, and the levels get repetetive fast. The happy story is the multiplayer.To put it short, the multiplayer is a blast. People have been complaining about teamkillers. They have autobanning, doy? With 6 new maps, 2 new weapons(should have added more), and 2 new vehicles, it'll keep you playing for hours.At $20.00, this is a real deal."
3,Halo Average Game at best,"I just completed the game. I have a 1300mzh Athlon with 384mb ram and ati 9000 pro video. All drivers are updated and the game ran a little choppy. I finally just gave in and accepted it. Driving the vehicles is fun, the guns are cool, but you're only allowed to have 2 guns at a time, which is a bummer compared to most games. The real pain is not being allowed to save in a certain section so if you die, you go all the way back to where the last checkpoint was.I don't understand why some people just rave about this game. It was fun, but not enough to rave about. I paid $40 for the game, it's only really worth about $20.I just had too many crashes and issues in the beginning. This was the worst game I've ever played that had so many issues. It's worse when you consider it's a ""Microsoft"" game. Don't buy until it's cheap..."
3,What's with the inaccurate guns,"I am interested in the unnamed disaster that killed every Marine on Earth. I concluded this must have happened because there is no way the Marines I have known would take such inaccurate weapons into battle. The weapons of the future should be BETTER than what we have now, but I found myself wishing for an M-14 or M-16 with the 203 grenade launcher. If it takes more than 5 or 6 hits to the body to kill something, you have the wrong gun. I abandoned the Marine weapons asap for the alien weapons that would at least hit what you aim at. Other than this all to common problem with futuristic shooter type games it was fun, worth the money overall."
5,Halo: Combat Evolved,I loved the game Halo. Probably the best game ever! Especially if you play useing co-operater. Its much easier as well.
2,"No Halo, just Horns for the PC","I just can't get excited about this game. Outdated, unintertesting and a lag in the mouse that I just couldn't seem to get rid of. Even handing this one off to a friend didn't win it anymore stars with more complaints of mouse problems and boring play. Skip this one, get something without the dated graphics and boring play."
2,"Great graphics, boring though.","This game is boring.I don't know what the big fuss about it is...the multiplayer is BORING...it's not even exciting.Graphics are amazing...boring, stupid plot though.Try Call of Duty for a good FPS this year."
3,Great Older Game,Great gameplay. A little old for most people who play games but still has a strong online community.
4,Good Game - To Hardware Intensive,"This game is definitely worth buying, but make sure that your computer can handle it. I've got a top of the line system and the game won't even run the way it should without alot of tweaking. They are supposed to be fixing this but we'll have to see. For a multiplayer game and a single player shooter, this is definitely the game to get though"
3,unreliable greatness,"This game deserves 5 stars, I'd give it more if it were possible... that is, it deserves 5 stars when working properly. I thought this game was great when I was playing with 4 people on XBOX, but playing with 16 online? Now thats a different story. Best multiplayer game I've ever played. However, a week after I bought it, whenever I tried to join an online game, my whole computer restarts, and a friend with the game also has the same problem. I have 2.4Ghz P4, 512MB ram, and a Radeon 8500."
3,"Good, but not all that","The game plays great, but some of the weapons are lame. For example the pistol has a scope/zoom, but the assault rifle doesn't. The assault rifle has a bigger spread then the shotgun. You can only carry two weapons, so it's important to pick two good ones. The character moves a just a hair above slow motion. Weapon pick up and switching take way to long. The fact that they actually removed co-op play from this game for the PC release, is unbelievable.Fun to play single player, fun death match. No co-op, some lousy weapon choices. The vehicles and flying machines are fun to mess with though. I'll probably play it a week or two before it hits the dead CD drawer. In all honesty though, I wasn't to impressed."
2,Repetitive but OK for the price,I liked the game for a while but found it rather repetitive. It certainly gives you a lot of gameplay for your buck although I'd have preferred less content in favour of more creativity with the level design. Finding your way through endlessly repeated passageways/decks got real old. Cortana was kind of fun and there were elements that were innovative for its time but overall -- a boring game.
5,the best game i have ever played,"this is the best game, if you, like me, dont have a xbox then you must get this, fun gameplay, great graphics, awesome sound. this game is the reason im getting a xbox 360, i deffinately recomend this if you dont have a xbox. (plus free online)"
3,Over rated example of moderate quality.,"With only a handful of weapons and vehicles to learn, the masses were able to absorb its contents quickly, and easily. Suddenly every jackass on the planet that made the mistake of buying a game console from a computer software company thought he was packed full of skill for being able to snipe people with a pistol. Guess what guy, you're not, and neither are the million other guys EXACTLY like you.The popularity of this game and its sequels disgusts me, as a game connoisseur and designer. But there is a good lesson to be learned: if you make a dumb game, expect the many dumb masses to fork over cash for it."
1,HORRIBLE!,"This is a horrible game, average graphics, bad controls,and unrealistic. ex. when you sniper someone it leaves a white trail on bullet, i thought snipering was being covert not on this game! overall a bad 1st person shooter."
1,Even QUAKE was better...,"Halo, the game of the year (like three years ago) is on the pc and it is the worst piece of junk ever. My computer is not even one year old, and its graphics card is good. However, I can't enjoy the simple pleasures of seeing my gun flare when I shoot, because it makes the video jump and lag like crazy. Not only this but the graphics look like an N64 game. The multiplayer stinks because its full of morons and unoriginal gameplay which can be found in about a million other games... even free ones.Don't waste your money."
3,Well.....,"The Xbox verson was, in my opinion, much better for single player. As for multiplayer, the new additions are fun and all but well, they dont truely beef up the expereince that much (with the exception of the banshee of course). However, for LAN parties there are very few games that can compare. There is nothing quite like rushing your neighbor's base and killing his entire team with an armada of banshees on blood gultch. If youre a big LAN Partier definetly get this game. Otherwise, buy it for the Xbox and hook up Gamespy Tunnel"
4,4.5 would be my actually rating.,"Well, compared to other Multiplayer games like CounterStrike this does lack a few things but other than that the game is pure fun. Umm ... I agree with the previous reviewer about teamkillers on the Multiplayer online mode but it's hard to know which players are teammates and which aren't cuz we all look the same. But TKers are in every online based game even CounterStrike has a bunch of them. Overall this game has a really clean graphic and entertaining gameplay. I'd recommend you buy it."
2,compatibility problems galore,good luck getting this to run. I have two new computers and neither of them would run it because of video card issues. I had to return it to microsoft because the wrapper was off.
4,PC Version pretty damn good,"I got to play the XBOX version at a friend's house and found it to be a lot of fun, the only drawback was that I am used to playing PC games and the XBOX resolution was not great, especially when you are playing two people at once.But the PC game is sweet -- rich graphics, sound, and extras makes improvements over the XBOX version!Drawbacks:- Too bad I can't have multiple gamepads on one computer and have a friend man the warthog.- I have a good graphics card but still couldn't get good playability on higher resolution and had to settle with 1024x768, so you'll need the TOP graphics card to play high rez.- Microsoft is involved."

4,It Can Always Get Worse,"Mr. Frauenfelder has scoured the globe for interesting bits of trivia related solely by their ability to horrify. Whether natural perils or stomach turning drunken antics, the book holds one's attention. Perhaps in reading of such events and things we can take solace in our normal and safe lives. Seriously, who first decided to make a drink out of berries scavenged from the dung of a wild cat? Who first opened a fruit that smells like rotting flesh and decided to taste it?My only complaint was that the format was extremely limited. Perhaps in keeping with the jocular tone of the work the author didn't want to get into too much detail, but detail is precisely what makes many of these things fascinating.If you have a friend or acquaintance who is discouraged, this would be an excellent gift. Perhaps we have an innate need to constantly reestablish that things can always be worse."
3,A lot of filler,"Indeed, this book made me laugh and grossed me out. All good, in my opinion.My beef is that although the book is 176 pages long, it really has about half of that in content. Each ""chapter/entry"" starts off with a whole page dedicated to a sentance stating what the subject is, ""Most Disgusting Drink"", for example. Then the entry usually starts off in the middle of the next page. The lay out of this book makes it seem like it's a lot longer than it really is. Take a look at the example. I would have hoped for a longer tome."
2,should be free,"99 cents seems like a lot for this. Oh, I need more words for this review; just like this book."
4,The worlds worst book review...,"As a keen 'Boing Boing' [...] .... ok, ok HUGE FAN! I knew Mark's wee book would be a fun and interesting read. I wasn't disapointed. Funny thing though, when I bought it (Kindle edition)in August, on a whim whilst bored shitless at work, I'm sure it cost only a couple of bucks, now its more than $7? Probably wouldn't have been keen to pay $7 for it... after all, its the type of book that you take into the toilet with you, to 'pass the time' as it were."
3,Great book for a plane ride,It was a great book for reading on a long plane ride. Not to deep and lots of short stories. I enjoyed this book.
3,you can tell some books by their cover,"The title and the cover graphic says it all. For the right niche in the right situation, this book would be, at least briefly, a focus of attention and a source of gross-outs, accompanied by snarffing, moaning, and tittering laughter (oh, sick!). Simple and superficial, it could be advertised in one of the Scholastic book catalogs. Probably most appreciated by 12 to 16 year old boys. Could be a fun xmas stocking stuffer. Whoa."
5,Public library favorite added to home library,"My kids (ages 7, 4 & 4) all LOVED this book when brought it home from the library. It is such a treat for them when I get a fave for them to keep as their own The problem now--who gets to have it? A wonderful book with lively, colorful illustrations."
3,Learning a new language is not easy,"As a non- English native speaker, I don't feel easy to follow the pace in the book. I may not have the talent for language, so that might be the reason I can not get it from the book. However, it is helpful in the dialogue part, because it contains the audio CD. After all, it still useful for learning German."
4,good but......,all editing staff is very good . but not playing some dvd . ex;;;pal dvd...also cd-r jpeg is playing very slow....vhs to hard drive is very good... flexible recording is good...vhs to dvd is good....also if your kids broke remote control $ 16 not bad ...
1,Huge Blunder,"I bought this model a year ago to replace a Panasonic DVD Recorder I bought two years ago, which had the hard drive crash, losing recorded shows not yet copied, as well as its ability to function. The new unit seemed good until its hard drive crashed in February. I returned it to the retail store where I bought it. They shipped it around the country, finally returning it to me 2 months later, unfixed, saying ""too costly to repair."" I was directed by Panasonic to a different shop and three whole months after it first broke, under warranty, my hard drive was replaced. Six months later, it has happened again. It seems to work until you start trying to edit commercials out of programs, preparing to copy onto a disc. Strike three Panasonic."
1,Quit after 11 months - Discontinued line,"I believe this model line is discontinued. I bought the product March 13,2007 and Dvd drive failed this past February. The HDD and recording features worked great in the beginning. Once I learned the editing tools, I loved the copying features. A huge negative for me was the fact that the TV guide is incompatible with the Dish network and I could never get the Clock set. After buying the extended warranty in January and the product still under manufacturer's warranty, I sent the product in for repairs. After 2 months, they're still waiting on parts being shipped from Japan. This kind of service is pathetic. This seems to be a common defect in the line and this kind of service makes me reconsider buying other Panasonic products."
3,Works good with some problems,"I purchased this unit in November last year. The unit works very well more than I expect.However, the power on button on the unit and the input connector next to this button did not work from day one. I had to use the remote control instead.Service department is the worse. The first technician just hung up my phone. The second (after waiting for 15 min.) took my info and promise to send me an UPS label and return authorization by mail (they can not do by email). The mail never came. I called again and this time I was redirected the phone five times with waiting tim of 15 min. each time. Eventually, I was able to talk with a person who promise to send me the label. When talking with their customer service, make sure you ask for the case number. I do not think anyone in this department work with responsibility. Sad story!"
1,Don't buy!,The unit works great. The problem is that Dish Network can turn off the part of the guide service that triggers the recording. After several months of sucessful recording all I have now is an expensive manual recording device. Panasonic reports that the problem is Dishnetwork service.The dish network policy is to get you to buy their tivo service at monthly fee.
4,Operating manual needs to be rewritten and updated,"This Panasonic recorder is a beautiful product but setting is up was a nightmare. Panasonic tech on the phone was very helpful but it took about 2 weeks for us to get the TV Guide set up with Comcast cable. It seems during setup you need to checkoff cable without a box and cable with a box and it does state this anywhere in the manual. To make a long story short we finally got everything setup and it is now working great. I'm not sure that many things are compatable with Comcast..but Panasonic pulled through. After all of my aggravation, if I had to buy another recorder I would buy this one...."
4,Panasonic DMR-EH75VS DVD Recorder / VCR Combo,"Unit seems to work well. A bit cumbersome to use as a straight DVD recorder, as you have to get around all the TV Guide setup. I probably could have used a simpler unit, as I don't wish to use the Panasonic to control my DirecTV receiver / DVR - I'm too happy with the DVR interface to use the Panasonic's TV Guide recording feature. Having the internal VHS deck should be a time-saver to copy lots of VHS tapes I have. Manual is OK, but fairly cryptic."
4,DMR-EH75VS DVD/VHS Recorder,"I recived my new DMR-EH75VS DVD/VHS Recorder and hooked it up. I find it to be easy to use and of high quality. I have a DMR-EH75 unit and find the new DMR-EH75VS controling software to be much better and easier to use.The Hard Disk is really a wonderful new advance and very convenient for time shift programing (TVO type).I cannot get the TV Guide feature to work. I have followed instructions, I have called Panasonic and still cannot get it to work.Other than that one issue, I am well pleased with the product and find it to be of high quality.The HDMI output produces a high quality playback.Therefor I rate it a four stars.G. Argo"
4,Great recorder; good transfers,I have been able to transfer my VHS collection to DVD with relative ease.I usually recorder my shows to HDD and later transfer some to DVD-R. The LP mode delivers a very good quality compared to my friends non-Panasonic recorder.The only thing that annoys me with this recorder is related to the TV guide. It can only download the guide when the unit is off. However when watch TV while it is off it will start to change the channel on my cable box as it finds the PBS station to download its information. Need to kept the unit on while watching TV and then turn it off to continue downloading.Other than this I think this is an great device.
5,Excellent alternative to paid subscription,Set-up was easy. Instruction book was too lengthy. TV guide loaded without a hitch. Great alternative to paid subscription. Recording features are easily navigated. I have not utilized dubbing features yet. Overall happy with purchase.
2,Recorder,Problem is that I cannot use TV Guide feature with Direct TV even though I have the latest HD receiver from Direct TV. This complicates setting up for recording TV shows. Spent hours (probably 6-8 hours) with Panasonic trying to resolve this problem. Disappointed since they advertise that it is compatible with Direct TV. Otherwise recorder works fine but failure to be able to use the TV Guide feature is a major disappointment. Probably would not have bought if I had known about the TV Guide incompatibility. I checked it out ahead of time and was not aware that there would be a problem when I bought the recorder.
5,Great item,"Despite several negative warnings in other Amazon reviews about this item not performing as advertised, I found this item functions beyond my expectations. Though I do concur that you must read the manual, I have performed all of the following with little effort: 1. transfer VHS to DVD; 2. transfer home video to HDD for editing and then burned to DVD; 3. transfer HDD taped programs to DVD and VHS; 4. transfered multiple combinations of DVD, VHS and HDD to DVD after editing on machine; 5. watched programs while copying others on to HDD; 6. recorded directly to DVD; and 7. various combinations of all the above. In short, even though I thought I was going to have to buy a Media PC to do edited compiliations for powerpoint presentation use anyway...with this machine, I don't have to! After an hour, I was wielding the remote with ease and performing multiple tasks at the same time. A little patience may be required in reading the manual, but overall, a great all in one machine."
5,List price (on Panasonic's website) is $499.95,"Great product - don't understand the pricing here on Amazon - list price on Panasonic's website is $499.95, and it's available from Circuit City for $449.99."
3,Decent recorder but with major downfall,"I have not used all the features but I want to warn others about this.Recorder does not have component video input, therefore you cannot record a high def FULL SCREEN picture. The recorder can only record or view 16:9 (widescreen) when receiving a Full screen high def picture. I contacted Panasonic numerous times & they could not explain why the picture would change from full screen to widescreen every time I turned on the DVD recorder. I contacted Monster cable & they told me that I can only get standard widescreen with composite video and that I would need a component video input to receive full screen picture in high def. I would not have purchased this unit if I knew that!"
2,DOA,"I received a bad unit, it had a bad harddrive and wouldn't boot. It gave errors that wern't listed in the book or on the support for the unit on the Panasonic website. Phone support isn't bad, but the documentation for the unit is. Thank goodness for the 1 month return policy of Amazon, I give that a 5 star rating!"
2,It was great for 4 days........,"Like I said in the title is was great for the first 4 days that I had it. I was playing with a few of the features and was happy with the ones that I got a chance to use, a little bit with the DVR feature recording shows to the HD using the TV Guide.The main reason I purchased the DMR-EH75VS was to transfer my large collection of home movies on VCR tapes to DVD. I was really happy with the ease of transferring them. Allot easer than using my PC. Anyway I got through 19 VCR tapes and then the DMR-EH75VS would not record anymore DVDs. It stop playing DVDs even commercially purchased DVD. The drive just makes noises and never recognizes the DVD. I'm in the process of returning the DMR-EH75VS and have not decided if I will get a replacement of the same type or decide on something else. I did like it right up to the point it died.That all I have for now. Will have to see how easy it will be to get a refund. That will be another review......"
2,A Very Awkward Size and Shape,"This jug is a real pain. It's of such a height and capacity that it tips over much too easily when full of water. It's too big to sit on the car seat next to me, but if I place it on the floor it's soon rolling around on its side. Not very suitable for a portable jug."
1,A leaker!,"This is the second generation of the Igloo Legend. The first generation had a stronger handle. Even worse, Igloo has eliminated the replaceable seal in the lid. They have also discontinued the seal as a replacement part. A definate: Do not buy!"
1,Horrible Cooler,"I had a wonderful Igloo cooler that lasted nearly 30 years--never leaked, handle worked great, spout let water out easily. When it finally broke, I naturally went for another Igloo. What a mistake! All of the qualities that made my older Igloo cooler wonderful had turned into problems in this version: the lid could not be screwed on easily and never sealed properly so it leaked all the time; the spout let out a little trickle rather than a nice stream of liquid; the spout also fell out often, creating spills; the handle came off easily whenever the cooler was full . . . an incredibly frustrating and horrible cooler! Bring back the wonderful old model! Until then, I'm off to Coleman or Rubbermaid."
1,Don't buy this thing,"I had an old Coleman jug for about 15 years, but it finally started leaking and so I thought I would replace it. I bought this jug at Dick's sporting goods for about 9.00. What a complete waste. This one leaks more than the old coleman jug, when it tips over, which as you can imagine happens a pretty good bit with a portable jug. Also the handle is a complete piece of crap, and won't stay on. This is rather annoying when you have just filled the jug but haven't put the lid on yet. Who wants to mop a 1/2 gallon of water off the floor? I just found a Coleman jug at Sports Authority for 5.00 and it appears to be far more durable. Dont buy this product you will regret it."
1,Not durable,"This is the fourth one I have had, because there aren't any other brands available in this size where I live. They get progressively less durable. The handles fell off and wouldn't stay on, and the outside slipped off the insulation, and they started leaking. I put mine in the dishwasher and it warped, so now it leaks even worse. The spout kept coming off when I would flip it up, and it leaks around the spout. The lid is hard to close tight enough to not leak, and then it is really hard to get back off. The ice inside melts quickly, even if the drink started out cold. I would not recommend this jug to anyone! I'm ordering a different brand off the internet this time."
3,So So,"Keeps the ice frozen all day even sitting in the sun, but does leak. When you try to drink out of it you have to lean forward to not spill it on you. I would reccomend the 1 gallon Coleman cooler, keeps ice frozen longer and doesn't leak."
2,"Dribble cup, anyone?","This was pretty disappointing. First of all, it's pretty big around. Not easy to lift with one hand when it's full of ice and water. So I MacGyver'd a handle out of the included nylon strap. Eh, it works. But when I tilt it up to sip from it, it tends to dribble several drops down my shirt, especially when it's full.I bought this Igloo cooler in hopes that the insulation would keep my icewater icy, but it doesn't keep things cool any more than the cheap, single-walled, plastic water-bottle it was meant to replace. At least that thing was taller and thinner, which made it easier to hold onto.The nice thing is that it's big enough around to put handfuls of ice into when the lid's off, which is one of the main reasons I bought it. Otherwise, kinda lame. I expected more from Igloo."
4,My favorite cooler,"Some beverage coolers are large . . . good for a crowd, but not for a single person. Others are small and portable, but not insulated. The Igloo 1-Quart bridges the gap to provide a handy size and great insulation. That's why it's my favorite. My only complaint (and it's a small one): I wish it came in a color other than red."
2,Not as represented,"The photo of this cooler suggests its a short, wide little jug. The reviewers who used it for their dogs, which was my purpose in purchasing it, spoke very highly about it. The cooler I received was taller and narrower which would make my dog's ability to drink from it more difficult. Additionally, I was put off by the odor inside after the cap was screwed off. Wound up returning it. The shipping was more than the cost of the cooler, so I wound up paying approximately $18.00 for shipping (both ways) for a $10.00+/- cooler. Oh, well."
1,do not buy this,okay so I purchase this thinking it is going to be elite and it does not work it leaks water every time i take a sip you get water on your shirt which might be okay if your outdoors playing sports or working construction as I do
1,Stay Away,"These are cheap pieces of junk. They leak everywhere. They are made so poorly that they have round bottoms and dont sit up. The handles break apart after a month or so. When you tilt it to pour it, it spills out the sides of the lid, the sides of the spout, and is a general mess. Stay away."
2,Leaks,I'll repeat what others have said in regards to the leaking. It has a poorly designed gasket in the lid ( I see in other reviews that some people didn't even get a gasket). It keeps popping out and you can't get it back in for long before it's back out again. Tired of it getting my shirt wet.
1,"Poor cooler, poor customer care","Purchased several of the 1 quart coolers -- not only do they leak, they come with a huge label on front that, when it finally peels off, leaves a big sticky nasty mess. Called customer care, and spoke with 2 different belligerent customer reps, and discovered that whatever issue you may have with their coolers, it must be something that happened AFTER they were manufactured. Not their fault of course(including the nasty glue under the huge label). If you purchase this thermos, don't leave the store without a solvent to dissolve glue, and some plastic bags to contain a leaky thermos.NOT recommended."
2,Not the best CD ever,"So I am a huge fan of Christian CD's. I own every iWorship that they have out so far. When I saw this one I knew I had to get it. I was thoroughly disappointed with the selection on this CD. I didn't see any contemporary songs and it was boring. There were only like two or three good songs but for the price, it just wasn't worth it."
2,read the newspaper and a good novel instead,"this book is unlikely to meet students' and professionals' needs and expectations, maybe because it's trying to do two distinct things at once: prepare students for the TOEFL and help readers incorporate the words into their active vocabulary.TOEFL prep is probably best served by drill, and this book offers a useful division of vocabulary into manageable chunks.actually incorporating vocab into your daily speech, however, is quite a different task, and this book offers little in that direction. i find both the 'conversation' and 'short talk' components to each chapter to be quite stilted and unnatural sounding--the exact opposite of the kind of model the target audience actually needs. reading a newspaper and a good novel and then discussing them with others is more likely to produce lasting vocabulary growth."
5,Favorite motivating kids movie,"If you don't know the story behind the movie, then suffice it today it's a few enterprising and intelligent kids who strive to start a business using the 'waste' left from their dad's ranch. It's a terrific story and one that I've loved since I was a kid. I've looked for it and was thrilled that Amazon had it online since it's not on DVD. Great movie for kids and adults alike!"
1,SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HEART IN MOTION AND BEHIND THE EYES,"The AMY GRANT of old is not here any more...the CD is lacking in style and anything new...These songs could of been stuck in the above CD's of the past...The way she use to memorize me, just is not there...The album is pathetic and slow and unfortunately just an old twist on new songs...it is time for old horses to be put out to pasture and let some new blood come in...There is nothing of substance here...I just wanted to add something new to this...I have listen to it a few more times since I bought it...thinking it might grow on me....(...)"
2,More slick production with soulless music,"Grant's best work was back in her ""Baby, Baby"" days and earlier, when she was still doing the Contemporary Christian thing. ""Simple Things"" finds her continuing with the slick studio production values of the past couple of albums without musical substance and the formula has worn thin. Next time out, Amy, I'd suggest you find some new direction, something with some fire to it - in other words, reinvent yourself. This one is for fans only but, where are the reviews from the fans?"
1,Who Needs Honesty?,"Several reviewers have extolled the virtues of Amy's ""honesty and openness"". Since none of us knows anything about her private life, how could we know if she is being honest and open. And why would we care? I buy an album for its musical virtues, which are lacking in ""Simple Things"". I would agree with the posters who have called the album bland, boring, dull, etc. Amy's vocal range is extremely limited and that translates into most songs sounding very similar. I don't think the CD will get a whole lot of airplay."
1,A sad musical reflection of Amy's slowly diminishing star...,"Amy Grant sinks to a new creative low with this album ""Simple Things."" She sings song that sound contrived and false in the face of true emotion. There is something so pretentious and fabricated about Amy Grant's image these days. It is sad because she once shone so bright in Christian music, and it would be great if she would return to her roots. I think her star would begin to shine brighter if she did. Not one song on this album moved, inspired, or touched me. I wish at least one had!"
1,From a Loyal Fan of Amy,"I was very disappointed with this cd, in fact, I probably won't listen to it again. The songs are hard to get used to. The lyrics, especially on the first song Happy, doesn't seem to be words of faith, but more of a secular love song without Christian values.I thoroughly enjoyed the Legacy album, but I think this will be the last Amy Grant album I purchase."
3,Good album but not Amy's best,"One who knows Amy's music well will probably agree that this latest album SIMPLE THINGS, is, well...simple. It's an easy listen, endulging us in only 10 quick songs; not as positive as 1991's HEART IN MOTION but not so much soul searching as 1997's BEHIND THE EYES. Overall, the production of the album is up-to-par with only one heavy hip hop-oriented song, SIMPLE THINGS. Otherwise, every other song is pretty much tamed with guitars and a light pop theme. There are no songs on this collection to rock to but every song is radio-friendly, except for EYE TO EYE which the message is obviously directed to her ex-husband and might be a little embarrassing to the listener who may feel as though they're reading a private letter. As in similiar songs from BEHIND THE EYES and even LEAD ME ON, Grant finds herself doing a little more soul searching but otherwise, this is an enjoyable album, however, not as good as her previous penned albums."

5,Simple beauty,"After a long delay, Amy Grant returns with her first studio album of new material in several years. Was it worth the wait? Definitely. This album has a beautiful continuous line as the songs are presented in order, from edgy rock to tender melodies, never overproduced as many of Amy's contemporaries do. As always, the strength of Amy's work, besides her unique tender voice, is her lyrics, and the words in these songs pack quite a punch. Listen closely to ""Eye To Eye"" and ""Out In The Open"" and ""Innocence Lost"" for a peek into the heart of this remarkable artist who I hope will continue to ""Touch"" her fans for years to come!"
5,Amy's back and she's ready to dig in!!!,"Amy Grant is one of the best-kept secrets in the music industry. I think many people aren't aware of the extent to which her music and life views have evolved over the years. She is a vibrant woman whose music has matured along with her. She's been to her own personal Hell and back, and it shows in the depth of her lyrics and music. Her vocals are at once sultry and rich, soothing and lyrical. This album is lovely. There's hardly any song I don't like - I'd say that the highlights are ""Happy"" (has #1 hit written all over it), ""Eye to Eye"" (poignant and beautiful) ""Out in the Open"" and ""After the Fire."" I hope that this album does well and a whole new set of people discover the wonders of Amy!!!"
5,Amy just gets better and better.,"This CD is more in line with her Behind These Eyes cd as far as being more intimate and revealing feelings (more real?). Very nice sounds, good variety. No one knows all the details of a relationship and it has to be difficult to be in the public eye when their opinion matters. My best to her and her continued walk through life!"
5,Amy sings from her heart!,"I have loved Amy Grant for years! This is Amy's best CD yet. You hear the words coming straight from her heart. As a Christian, I admire the courage it took for Amy to share this intimate CD with those who love her music. Forgiveness is a gift we give and receive!"
2,Expected Better from Amy . . . .,"It took me a little while, but learned to really enjoy Amy's last pop album ""Behind the Eyes"". Amy's new pop album ""Simple Things"" is written in that same vein - lots of guitar for a rock/pop sound. For me, however, the songs just aren't that good. I've now listened to it several times and it just doesn't do anything for me. One minor criticism is that it seems to be overproduced on a couple of songs - with special effects that you'd expect to hear on a Brittney album. I love Amy's voice and have liked her songwriting in the past, but found this cd to be a major dissapointment for me. I'll continue to listen and if I change my mind, I'll re-post and give it a higher rating."
2,"Too much arrangement, too little Amy","After growing up with ""My Father's Eyes"" and onto the rockier ""Ungarded"", ""Behind the Eyes"" was my latest encounter with an older Amy and an older Me.I was so impressed with her depth and obvious poetic talents, especially with songs about burned out small towns like ""Nobody Home"" and the heart rending ""Like I Love You"". ""Take a little Time"" has become my recent personal anthem. She seemed to really come through her trial and offer the gold straight from her heart.As I listen to this new CD, I cant hear Amy, not the Amy I have known. She may be under the glossy arrangements, but her unique, and compelling raspy alto voice is overwhelmed by the neat instrumental tracks. I hope she finds the confidence demonstrated in efforts past, to sing what is in the moment of her life. No apologies for the past, no justifications."
4,Touching,"I only can say it's a touching album. Beautiful melodies an more beautiful words. Her relaxing voice is getting better by the year. For me Innocence lost is the most beautiful song, it really touches you. And Simple things is a tune that makes youhappy and make you realize what life's al about.A complete album, a shame there only ten songs on it."
3,Great Album but . . . want to hear more like Age to Age,"I have been a long time Amy fan since 1983 as a teenager and now my wife, children love her songs too. I am posting a review here because her site is a paid-site- quite hard for international fans like me.I love her pop style. But still longing for songs like Faith Walking People, In A Little While, Love of another Kind, Lead Me On, Find a Way, El Shaddai, Jehovah, Hope Set High, etc . . .Legacy . . . is a GREAT, AMAZING ALBUM. Amy, if you reading this, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE MORE Gospel, Christian songs . . . we miss these. I would love to hear a 2005 or 2006 Gospel Album!!!God bless you and Vince, all the children, all fans, your work and ministry.Dino+(Metro Manila, Philippines)"
1,I Love Amy Grant !!,"Everyone in the Nashville area loves Amy, she is a wonderful person. But, I really dislike this CD. Several reviewers have said that many of the songs sound alike, and I agree. The biggest problem I have with ST though, is Amy's voice. Don't know if she got some bad vocal coaching, or if its just a part of getting older, but I want to hear *Amy* singing, NOT Marlene Dietrich !!!"
1,"Bland, Overproduced and Disappointing",This is not a great musical or artisitic offering from Ms. Grant. Most of the tracks are bland at best.
5,Worth the wait...,"Having grown up listening to all of Amy Grant's albums since the very beginning, I have always been impressed -time after time - with her ability to keep her music fresh AND her way of writing songs that people can relate to. This album is no exception! It is a GREAT CD! In a nutshell, this is one of those albums you can listen to over and over again, and before you know it, you are singing along at the top of your lungs and loving every minute of it! The upbeat songs are catchy & fun and the ballads are full of simplicity and honesty. This is one of those rare albums in that every song is REALLY good. Thank goodness for artists like Amy who continue to make their mark after 25 years of recording, while still keeping up with the ever-changing styles of music. I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys pop music that has substance. This album will be in my CD player for a long time!"
5,Another winner from Amy,"I've been buying Amy's music since I was in high school in the 80s, and now that I'm in my (gulp) mid thirties, what I like best about Amy Grant is that she seems to be growing right along side me. ""Behind the Eyes"" will always be my favorite CD from her, ""Simple Things"" however, is a perfect next album. It's all about getting back into the light of forgiveness and love. I got chills when I heard the title track. It's just a great CD. I think long term fans will really love it. It's more in the lines of ""Lead Me On"", and ""Behind the Eyes"" than ""Heart in Motion"" and ""House of Love"". Epect a deeper CD. I hope you like it!"
2,Comparing Velveeta pasta and cheese mixes,"There are two Velveeta pasta and cheese dinners. This one, and Kraft Velveeta Original Shells & Cheese, 12 oz. They both use packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder.But sadly, this one's not that good. It's salty, and the tiny bits of broccoli are few and far between. And with all the sodium (1230 mg per serving compared to 940 mg for the regular Shells and Cheese), it's a long way from healthy.Shells and Cheese is better. It's pure, creamy comfort food that goes down smooth and leaves no aftertaste. The pasta's ridged-shell shape makes every bite taste good, as dribbles of cheese seep into each piece and stick to its sides. It's much better than the broccoli version... and way more yummy (if more expensive) than the regularKraft Macaroni & Cheese Supermac & Cheese Pasta and Sauce, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)."
4,Macaroni/Cheese,I love Velveeta and I love the rotini and cheese; I have had it before but it is hard to find in the grocery stores I shop at...I found it not to be as good as I remembered....the broccoli was minimal at best.
2,"Broccoli, really?","Tastes good because, well, it's Velveeta. But if you're buying it for the broccoli, don't bother. The tsp of dried broccoli included in the package hardly makes it ""with broccoli""."
5,Finally!,"I came across this product in the store in the form of those little 2oz cups that Easy mac comes in (I don't know if it's 2 oz exactly but it's the small single serving cups that you can put in the microwave). I liked it so much I came to my best friend Amazon to see if I could buy more and was pleasantly surprised when I found that you could buy it in the larger size. Obviously there are no health benefits and the broccoli comes dried in a little packet so there's not much to be expected, but if you like Velveeta and broccoli give this a try! I love it. It's quick and easy and difficult to find in a store so this is the place to get it. It's everything you love about traditional Velveeta with the fun twisty rotini pasta and broccoli parts. Very happy."
5,ALEXISONFIRE - Heart Skull - Belt Buckle,Very pleased with the service. I had been warned that delivery wouldn't be until after Christmas as it had to be shipped from the USA. It actually turned up in plenty of time and made my son's day!
4,Asian Studies textbook...,"Purchased for a college class and it was a really interesting read. Also, very easy text to read and understand."
3,animal reproduction,"this book is wonderful to look at. gives lots of instructions, but still need some talent to pull it off like the photos. haven't tried it yet, anxious to get started"
5,This is a terrific book,The book was wonderful and the seller was fair and fast to ship I am very pleased with this book
5,Great book,Great Book! I learned a view new techniques . Great step by step with photos. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn how to do animals.
4,Great Miter saw,This saw works great and has plenty of power. The only time it even complained a little I was doing some wet 2x10 pressure treated at an angle.
3,Poorly Adjusted,"This saw was poorly adjusted when I took it out of box. The degree plate in front had 2 of the 3 screws loose. However after extensive readjusting, squaring, etc. This saw gives a very good cut.I do think at this price, it should have a better extension table, and a hold down for your work. Most saws in this price range have these features."
4,Solid tool,"Two few things attracted me to this saw in the store right off. One, the finely machined base is very slick and makes changing angles a breeze and a joy. Nothing binds and all the controls are easy to reach and manipulate. Even the control to lay the saw over into a compound cut is easy to get to and easy to use. And two, the horiztonal D-handle was more comfortable and more sensible than the vertical handle on my old 10"" Delta mitre saw. And there is a handle on top to carry the thing.I finally bought one here and got it home. I like the fit and finish, but the 90 and 45 degree settings were off. And the motor whines a little more than I would like, but otherwise I'm happy with it. Seems to be a good buy."
1,JUNK,If you are a framing carpenter this saw is fine. If you are a woodworker /finish carpenter this saw is junk. It can not produce a 45 degree miter since the table is not flat. The fence was bowed and I got a new one and that one was bowed. Its impossible to get the blade perpendicular to the table since it is not flat. I've checked other saws and they all have the same problem. My brother has this saw and we both hate it due to its lack of fine accuracy.
3,Just not enough power.,"I purchasd this saw after my 10"" Sears Craftsman compound miter saws main arbor gear stripped out. I never seen anything like it. The spline gear was totally stripped to where the blade would not even move. The motor would run , but the gear was dust, it had to be made of pot metal. Sears would not do anything for me because it was out of the warrantee period, and the gear was almost as much as a new saw. So I looked for a saw that would never have this problem. I called the repair center for Dewalt, and they had never had a problem with this main gear. So I purchased the 705 Dewalt I have used it hard and it works great other than I think its power is alot less than what it should be. When I am making a cut the saw seems to bog down and I have to really take my time with each cut. The saw has done this since the day I took it out of the box."
2,Many Problems With This Saw,"I have used this saw for two years and have found many problems with it. First, the eletric brake has worn out and it frequently does not even kick in. Second, when cutting miters to the left there is limited room to put your hand to hold the work piece. You better bolt the saw down befor using it because it has a tendency to move while using it. I am planning to buy a Porter-Cable to replace this saw."
2,One more point: Redesign?,"Also, note that DeWalt changed the design of this saw a few years ago. Some of the older reviews on this site obviously pertain to the older 13-amp model 705. The current model is a 15-amp saw. I have no experience with the previous design of the 13-amp saw, which may or may not have the same front-end-of-table-lifting-up issue that the current model has.I did not mention it in my main review, but this saw does not have a 1"" diameter arbor shaft: DeWalt gives you a washer to use with all your 12"" blades that have 1"" diameter arbors (all of them?).Note also that Amazon's ""Editorial Reviews"" product description inaccurately states that the saw is a 13 amp model, which was the previous generation of DeWalt's 12"" miter saw."
3,SURPRISED,"I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WHEN I OPENED MY SAW WHICH ARRIVED IN AN APPARENTLY FACTORY SEALED BOX I WAS SURPRISED BY THE FLAWS IN THE WORKMANSHIP I FOUND. THE SAW LOOKED LIKE IT WAS USED. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FILTHY, AND HAD SCRATCHES AND NICKS IN SEVERAL PLACES. THE FIT AND MACHINING OF SOME COMPONENTS USED TO MAKE UP THE SAW ARE TERRIBLE. IF I HAD IT TO DO AGAIN I WOULD BUY THE SAW LOCALLY AND PAY THE EXTRA TWENTY BUCKS AND THE TAX WHICH IS ALL I SAVED. THE SAW DOES CUT WELL WHICH IS OK IF YOU DON'T MIND PAYING...FOR LESS THAN EXPECTED APPEARANCE."
4,Does its job well,"Bought it for some home remodelling. It came highly recommended from a friend who has 2. It's smooth and accurate but most importantly, powerful enough to get things done easily. Forget about the wimpy dust bag though. It's useless. I was pleasantly surprised that it could cross cut my 195mm wide laminate plank. Saves me a trip to the table saw. The blade is o.k. but I wished for a better one after going through 300 square feet laminates. It's a very high quality saw that does the basics well. I am a satisfied user."
4,The music is all there!,"I was suprised to see that the music was all there, even though the back of the box says that the music has been changed. Not as good as the first 2 seasons because they filmed before a live audience, but it's still early Happy Days!"
1,this is their chance for redemption...,"just a heads-up to those of you who care, or are just tuning in...season two edited out the original music in favor of an inept clipart soundtrack. rock around the clock was also replaced during the opening credits. the video quality of season two was inconsistent...very poor in some scenes, and okay in others. if you are looking for the real stuff, my advice to you would be to wait until this thing is reviewed thoroughly before deciding to venture any hard-earned cash on it. i loved happy days as a kid, but season two was so disappointing that i traded it in for store credit toward something else. ***PLEASE DO NOT REPEAT MY MISTAKE. I WISH I HAD WAITED BEFORE BUYING SEASON TWO.***"
1,Childish nonsense,"This is the season that ended Happy Days. It became a silly fantasy show that had nothing to do with the 50's, it was boring and ridiculous. ABC and the producers aren't to blame, though, the audience wanted a cartoon version of the 50's and didn't want a show about about a 50's family. Ron Howard commented ""I was bored by what happened by the 3rd season and wanted out of it"". Who can blame him? A once precious TV show was now a silly clown act, aimed towards juveniles and people whose minds are bland and are entertained by constant childish nonsense. The 50's were not like this, later, Ron Howard would say he regretted every season after season two.He said he was embarrassed to have been a part of the show. Hey, Ron Howard, we understand. The 3rd season plots were idiotic and predictable, Saturday morning cartoons were far more intelligent.A mind is a terrible thing to waste."
1,Daysgonebye,"Five weeks and counting. Never received the product. I will never buy from this seller again, wish I didn't already."
3,Great Show- Awful DVD Production,"The first three seasons of ""Happy Days"" need little introduction to fans of classic TV. The writing and acting was stellar- although the biggest change- and not necessarily for the better- was switching to filming the show in front of a live audience in this year.The product itself is unfortunately abysmal. It's hard to image it being any worse. The care these shows are given is reminiscent of the hapless approach RCA Records took to marketing Elvis Presley's catalog in his final years. While the music ""edits"" aren't as obvious as in season 2, the transfer to DVD- particularly on the set-ending ""Anniversary Special"" is actually blurry and difficult to watch. A home-recorded VHS to DVD transfer couldn't have looked any worse! The lack of any special features, notes, or care in the preparation of this set is sad. I bought my copy on the marketplace and couldn't recommend paying full-price for such a poorly crafted treatment of this great American sitcom."
4,Classic comedy!,"The Cunninghams and company are back in this third season collection -- the first episode of which features Fonzie's moving into the apartment above their garage and essentially setting the stage for becoming ""one of the family.""Memorable episodes include ""Dance Contest,"" where Marion decides to enter, and the two-part ""Fearless Fonzarelli,"" where the Fonz is injured attempting a motorcycle stunt.Also, Laverne and Shirley make an appearance, before going into their own spin-off (also having released Season 3 at the same time as Happy Days). I always enjoy having cross-overs of the characters, even if the roles are minimal; it just feels like getting an additional treat.The one negative thing about this box set is that, like ""Laverne and Shirley,"" there are no extras! Like many fans, i would greatly enjoy some bloopers or interviews with the actors...yet none are included in any of the ""Happy Days"" sets to date."
1,maybe worth 1.00,"this movie is a poor excuse for ""The Buddy Holly Story"" ""it's very inacurate, and personally Busey is NO comparrison to ""The Great Buddy Holly"" the energy was there, but I literally laughed out loud when he sang! Sorry. I don't know how he got an award. They should have done MAJOR overdubbing The book Rave On by Philip Norman is the BEST way to see, live, and breath Buddy Holly for a short period of time!"
1,Buddy Holly Story,Was not pleased with the blu ray. Sound was out of syn withwith what I was watching on screen. I returned blu ray back.
1,Don't Buy This,"If you are truly interested in learning anything about Buddy Holly, don't buy this. The makers of this film abandoned Holly's life and made a cut out caricature to prance across your screen with Fender in hand. I suggest The Real Buddy Holly Story made by Paul McCartney. Save your money and time.The Real Buddy Holly Story"
2,A Story About Buddy Holly,"Yes it is great rock and roll movie. Fun to watch and very entertaining. Angry parents, rebellious teens, stupid mainstream music industry people. Gary Busey is wonderful and fully deserved the Oscar nomination.That said, 90% of the movie is HOGWASH! About the only thing they got right was that there was a Buddy Holly who had a band called the Crickets from Lubbock Texas. The WORST is the ""dark meat"" comment to peg Jerry Allison as a racist. And the fact that Gary Busey got much of his information from Jerry makes the scene in the movie that much more shameful. Showing Lubbock Texas as a rock and roll hating town and his parents not supporting him is just plain stupid. In fact they bought his Stratocaster for him. The errors go on and on. Enjoy it with a grain of salt."
3,the buddy holly story,"good movie, just missed the mark on some areas of his life and dwelled on the less important. Great performances of the cast, just needed better writing"
2,poor blu ray quality,"did I write 'poor quality'in the title? There's no blu ray image quality at all...It's the worst transfer to blu ray I had to witness until now. Secondly, the sound is mediocre and thirdly there are no subtitles (and of course no extras...).This disk is for sure the result of the path of the least effort taken by its producers.Actually, it should be forbidden that results like this have the BD quality label.Lucky for me the movie and the performances are allright, that's the reason for the generous 2 stars...Y.D."
4,"Inaccurate but the ""energy"" is there","Amazon's review of the film pretty much says it all. I would just echo my personal sentiments that, although a lot of the facts were wrong, the overall ""energy"" of Holly and his music is not lost and makes the video well-worth buying, keeping, and watching over and over again."
2,"aka ""The Gary Busey Story""","Important when it first came out in 1978 because it helped revive interest in Buddy Holly in this country, unfortunately if you are not a real knowledgeable fan of Buddy Holly and believe this to be the ""true story"", you will be disappointed to know otherwise. For entertainment value alone it can be appreciated and Busey does give his all, but any viewing of this should be immediately followed by a viewing of the Paul McCartney documentary ""The Real Buddy Holly Story"" from 1987 which ""set the record"" straight. Truth is, Gary Busey's career benefitted much more from this movie than Buddy's legend and legacy ever did. Viewer beware!"
2,Gary Busey was on point in hit&miss film,while this film&it's take on Buddy's life leaves alot of error in time spots Gary Busey brings His only true noteworthy Performnace for His Entier Career here to me.Gary Busey to Me has always been like a Poor Man's Nick Nolte&Never quite getting what He was meant to do on the Big screen right but here He has all of the right formula&shows more depth here than at any other time that I have watched His other works.Buddy Holly was a very Talented Artist.
2,Horrible Transfer,This transfer caught me by surprise as the aspect ratio is 4x3 and states at the beginning of the movie that it has been cropped to fit the screen. What a ripoff by the studio. Additionally no effort was made to clean the film for transfer so the dust and scratches are plentiful. It looks like it was mastered from a VHS tape. Avoid this version at all cost.
1,"More than a few ""historical innaccuracies.""","Other than the title and a few of Buddy Holly's songs, this film has nothing to do with the Rock legend. If one enjoys this movie as a period piece with a Buddy Holly-like soundtrack, fair enough. But no one watching this movie should kid themselves for a minute that they are learning ANYTHING about the real Buddy Holly. The apologists in the other reviews here should take the time to read one of several books about the man. They can still enjoy the movie for what it is, but must finally admit what it is NOT: a biography of Buddy Holly. And look for ""The Real Buddy Holly Story"", a documentary produced by Paul McCartney - a Buddy fan if ever there were one."
5,littlest pet shop monkey,"This is a great product at a reasonable price. It was almost impossible to find the monkey anywhere else. It will be much loved and played with. These are very durable and fun toys. I will give these toys a five star rating for being durable and fun. And when ordered, I was surprised at how quickly I received them!"
2,"Sorry, but YUCK!","This is a very entertaining book, but I wouldn't want to cook (or eat) from it. While there are a couple of ok recipes, some of them are real stomach turners, e.g., cut up some Whoppers from burger king and mix with catsup, mustard & bbq sauce, put a puff pastry crust on it and bake. Scrape the condiments off the buns, toast and serve along with it. Puhlease!! Lots of this type of recipe--not nutritious cooking, not even appetizing. Did give it a couple of stars for entertainment value."
1,I expected more...,"Many of the recipes in this book are yucky. Not only that, but they weren't really 'shortcut' recipes as advertised. This isn't what I expected from the Slob Sisters, and I was very disappointed. It went to the second hand shop the day after it arrived. Please check this out from your library first before deciding to buy. It may save you some $$."
2,"Was good, isn't anymore.",Definitely not worth the money anymore. I don't what they've changed but it's for the worse. I've ordered this before and absolutely loved it. I got a french press a long time ago just for this coffee and it tasted great. It makes me sad that it's so ho-hum now.
2,no quality consistency,"The first time I ordered this it was heavenly. The beans were dark brown and oily, smell divine, and the brew was caramely, smooth and perfect!So, I splurged and ordered another bag and claimed that it would be my weekend coffee.I was greatly disappointed with my Saturday morning brew. The second bag, the beans were light tan, and lacked that oily sheen, and smelled slightly bitter. The brew was lacking depth, and slightly bitter, not much better than a grocery store medium colombian roast. Now, I don't even want to brew it.The product is too pricey to risk product consistency and I will not purchase it again."
1,Poor Taste,"After reading the reviews I decided to order a bag and try it. I had had numerous styles of Kona coffee over the years and love the smell and flavor. When it arrived I ground some up and brewed up a pot. The smell was there but the flavor was lacking. It was missing that Kona pop that I have experienced in the past with other coffee's. Over the next few weeks I tried different brewing combinations. No matter what I tried, it was quite bland and just did not have any flavor. I was quite disappointed by the coffee."
2,stale coffee beans,"The coffee beans are large and have even size. The package stated the expiration date is in June. However, upon opening the package, beans looks too oily. Not a good sign!I uses AeroPress for my coffee and inverted method most of the time. I had been making coffee from mostly home roasted beans. This cup of coffee is the worst. It's not bitter or sour but just banal and smell/taste awful.If you are interested in Kona, you might want to look somewhere else.Update:To be fair, one star might be too low. I update it to two stars for the visual appeal of the bean."
4,Wrong Roast!,"Ordered Kona Bean DARK ROAST and received MEDIUM ROAST. This was the same reason I switched to Amazon for ordering as no one at the Kona Coffee plantations seems to know the difference between MEDIUM and DARK roasts!! VERY ANNOYING!!!!! I would try and return this, however, I didn't realize the issue until I opened the bag and noticed the tan beans instead of the expected dark brown/black beans.Fortunately Amazon shipped a new bag of dark roast at no extra cost! Thank You Amazon!The Dark Roast is great and has a rich flavor (now that I have it). I've always loved Dark Roast and Kona Dark Roast is my absolute favorite. Thanks Amazon for keeping me a happy customer."
1,bad choose,"I drink all variety of Hawaiian coffee over 15 years and like to try something new, so this one have very bad taste and i think this mix off all junk coffee not Hawaiian and it overpriced $8.00 coffee selling for $30.00 ""good business"". This is My personal opinion maybe someone like it, or not tried other coffee."
5,Amazing...,"My wife and I LOVE this coffee. We've tried a lot of different types of Kona and this is by far the best, and most like the coffee we drank while in Kona. During the holidays we gave a bunch to family and friends and everyone is hooked Our shipments always arrive on time and the coffee is super fresh. I highly recommend it."
5,"A Rich, Bold & Flavorful Kona!",Hawaii Roasters have hit a homerun with this great tasting dark roast Kona! I recommend it highly... enjoy!
2,Disappointed,"I took a chance on this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews that I read. The package arrived within three days of ordering, and the coffee was sealed in a standard vacuum-sealed bag. I opened the bag and noticed that the coffee smelled stale. Normally fresh-roasted coffee has a certain ""life"" to the scent, but these beans smelled as if they had been on a shelf for a while. I brewed the coffee and the flavor was similarly uninspiring. The coffee was mellow, as expected, but the flavor was flat. I have had high quality Kona in the past, and this sample is clearly inferior to my previous experience.This is the first time I have troubled to review a product sold by Amazon. I have no previous experience with this coffee roaster, and since others found their coffee to be to their liking, it is possible that something went wrong with this particular batch. I am pleased to report that Amazon has refunded me for this purchase."
1,Not what it used to be,I have been drinking Hawaii Roaster coffee for some time and have been pleased but those days are over. They have reduced the weight of the bags from 16 to 14 ounces without adjusting the price accordingly. The worst thing is that the dark roast is a lot lighter now. The dark roast beans are much lighter so it takes more of them to make pound as the moisture content is much lower therefore I feel it would it to be more profitable to roast the as little as possible.
5,Great Beans!!!,"These are great beans for my morning/afternoon espresso:) Smooth flavor, makes me want an espresso right now!!! As good as being in Hawaii but without the nice weather and ocean."
5,Great Kona coffee,"This coffee is wonderful! Great flavor and it arrived in fresh condition. The price, as compared to other Kona brands, is also good. I am ordering more."
4,"Good Joe, but...","I purchased this coffee specifically for use with my French Press as I had been told that coffee from the Kona Coast was ""the one"". I picked the dark roast because I love a good strong, dark cup of coffee... Although this was a good cup of coffee, I did not find it to be ""dark"" or particularly ""strong"". It may be just me, maybe I'm brewing it wrong, as I am a novice when it comes to the French Press process as well as Kona coffee itself. I have yet to use it with my drip coffee maker, but am planning on purchasing another pound of whole bean for that purpose. The verdict is still out."
5,A 'Must' Read,"'Shooter in the Sky: The Inner World of Children Who Kill' was a fascinating and thought provoking book. The author wrote with a great deal of expertise and yet, spoke and explained things in terms that anyone could understand. I couldn't put the book down! I recommend that everyone read this book. It is about a phenomenon that touches us all."
3,Mediocre,"No real variety in this cd. The tracks are kind of the same. You hear about monsters and serial killing. Maybe about three tracks really worth listening to. The beats are alright but could be better. Blaze Ya Dead Homie's new cd ""Clockwork Grey"" has more plays than this one."
3,Bit Soft,"As we all know, Twiztid isn't for the faint of heart.The most memorial album created by Twiztid would have to be Freak Show, and in my opinion i was hoping that this album would be as hardcore, but it isnt.I got the impression they where running out of things to sing about...getting a little stale in places so they bought in some other artists to bring in a freash flavour. We all have high expectations of Twiztid..and i didn't feel hugly impressed.HOWEVER!! For hardcore fans of Twiztid...get this album, it's been in my CD player for about a month now, it has some very memorial tracks and the beats are great with Jamie and Paul delivering some serious lyrics as always.For those who are not huge fans of Twiztid, or havn't heard them before...go for Freak Show. Just seems to me they have gotten a bit lost in their direction in this....it's not the Twiztid we all know and love."
2,Not fun at all,"I only listen to three songs off this album: Welcome Home, Sex Drugs Money & Murder, and Busyoheadopen. The second one, with the Dayton Family, is really the only good song off the album, otherwise it would have been a 1-star rating. The last song with ICP was pretty dull."
4,Among their best work,"There are a great many good songs to be found here and only a few that are so-so. No B-side or filler material exists on this album. The collaborations are fantastic and really feel like they were joint efforts. Not just songs created by one party that another party had placement on. All in all, this really does rank among their best work. Any fan should own this."
5,Welcome Home,This is Twiztids most recent LP to drop. Anyone that likes rap will like this and Juggalos will love it. Welcome Home and Raw Deal are my favorite tracks. Welcome Home is one of the best tracks every. Jamie's powerful and forceful rap and Monoxides raspy yet smooth flow are the new dynamic duo. These ninjas know how to put it down and burn it up.
1,not trustworthy,"I received this unit today and have been testing various power sources, both DC & AC for the last hour. Sometimes it works perfectly and properly presents the appropriate voltage, other times it just starts counting up or down, still other times it does nothing.Testing the household outlets was the last straw. Voltage fluctuated slightly, but some sockets, that are known to be good, showed no voltage at all, even after many attempts. That's inexcusable. When a meter is off checking AA batteries, it's not a big deal. A person could get killed if the meter doesn't function properly when testing 110VAC power wires and outlets. I can't trust this unit, so back to the dealer it goes."
5,Awesome!,"This is sincerely one of a whole series of good albums I have bought this year. The band manages to blend soft, worshipping, praiseful songs with hard rock beats and heavy metal sounds (similar to Skillet, another great artist) into an awesome CD! This is really a CD I can share with my non-Christian friends without worrying about what they'll think of the words and lyrics."
5,"""Beautiful Glow"" shines!","Okay, so maybe this album is different than their first, but if it wasn?t, where would the proof of growth be? ?Beautiful Glow? is a little faster-paced than ?Welcome to,? but still demonstrates a passionate and personal relationship with the Creator and His love for us.Nextly, I think this album is actually an incredible step from ?Welcome to,? as far as musicianship goes. There are so many obvious influences to be heard throughout this album (the Beatles-ey impression provided by the ?E? in ?Morning Glory? is UNdeniable). Also, I am an avid fan of Gabe?s pre-Circus music, and there is some presence of his mid-nineties sound in ?Lovliest Bride.?Last-ish I would also like to say that if you dislike anything about this album, i.e. rhythm, solos, vocals, or composition, I would have to say that you are hopelessly white and have no sense of style or rhythm whatsoever. Ahem. Thank you, that is all."
5,One HOT read,"As a bdsm sub, this book had my thighs tingling. I was immediately drawn into the story of how she meets her Master online and finds herself almost immediately hypnotized, doing things she'd never before imagined... getting collared, immersing deeper and deeper into her devoted servitude, and finding true contentment in her use. The scenes made me almost drool. The individual chapters made each one have more impact. Each different, not too long, not too short. Perfectly described. There were times I had to put the book down to ""take a break"". *smiles* I've recommended this to other bdsm lifestylers as a very stimulating narrative, as well as a great source of wicked ideas. I'll soon be reading it again. Definitely one of the best bdsm erotic books I've found so far. Yummy."
4,A Good Read,I really enjoyed reading this book. I recommend it to anyone curious about the submissive lifestyle.
4,This book was great!,I really liked this book. It was written very well kind of as a diary. I read it in less than 3 hours.
1,Watch the credits,"This is one of the most pathetic films I have never finished watching. The acting if you could call it that is woefull, script is inane in fact its the only film that I have never watched to the end and the credits at the start are the best part of what I saw.Al Watts"
1,very disappointed,The title song is not sung and I was very very disappointed. I purchased the cd for this song and the others are there but this is sadly missed.Three Coins in the fountain really missed the title song.
5,Get the Salt Out is a Great Book,This book was so easy to read and follow that I did not feel that I was on a restricted diet. The book identified lots of hidden sources of salt that I had no idea existed and made me feel that I was in safe hands following the author's advice.
1,Bad science,"The author is guilty of repeating a lot of bad science. The is ABSOLUTELY no difference between table salt and sea salt as far as the body is concerned. The same goes for natural vs artificial MSG, which is recognized as ""generally safe"" by the FDA.I imagine a lot of people have taken to using sea salt on this bad advice. It's just as likely to give you a stroke or heart attack!"
1,A Hazard to Your Health,Any book that tells us we can avoid the hazards of salt in our diet by using sea salt is itself a hazard to our health and must be the work product of someone who did not fare well in chemistry.
2,Cleverly Progressive yet Constantly Stale ?,"I'm afraid that this album (imho) just doesn't do enough keep anybody interested...granted, it has some varied enough beats that occasionally helped my head to nod back and forth, and enough layered synths & ambient sounds to prevent boredom, but sadly I couldn't find anything to inspire any emotion or get remotely excited about...>I'd just like to point out that you can actually download all but one of the 13 tracks from the free music section and make your own mind up; which is the only reason I wrote this review anyway! :-P"
1,"So bad, it's good!","This film isn't supposed to be a comedy, but anyone who is familiar with horses or the world of horse shows will find it hilarious. The title character is played by several horses that don't even look alike (it's especially fun to watch his tail change length from scene to scene). I also enjoyed the show ring scenes where the ring announcer gives a running commentary on the rider's performance and life history. The setting is someplace like Iowa or Nebraska and the lead actress has a french accent. I must have missed the part where this was explained, but it certainly adds something to the overall hokiness of the film. Poor Mickey Rooney. I'll bet he has nightmares about this one!"
1,A movie barely cobbled together,"Stephanie (Isabel García Lorca) finds a beautiful white stallion one day and takes it home with her - ""Honest, Dad, he followed me home from school"" - and turns him into a show-jumper. Meanwhile, Lightning's rightful owner, Barney (Mickey Rooney) is wondering what's become of his horse. Perhaps it's karma for taking something that isn't hers, because shortly after finding the critter Stephanie is diagnosed with a degenerative eye disease and has her pride and joy stolen from her by Barney's creditors. Lazy acting meshes with the poor continuity, and overwrought storyline.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,Just Say Neigh!,"Our daughter loved the Black Stallion movie, and I was a big horse nut as a kid too, so I thought, hey, Mickey Rooney, Susan George, a pretty horse. Oh, my word. Mr. Ed would have delivered his lines better than this cast. And the music? It was horse-hockey from start to finish. And I didn't even notice all the equine switcheroos. I loved it that the bus driver would leave one of his students at a hospital to watch over some drunk they pulled off the side of the road. The clueless bad guys who leave with a name instead of the money, the fight with the girlfriend that made less sense than a congressional hearing, the horsewoman who tells the stable boy about the girl's medical report before the girl finds out herself. This was a veritable Kentucky Derby of faux pas. I just hope Mickey Rooney can find it in his heart to forgive the agent who talked him into this pile of road apples."
5,whole new movie when watched as an adult...hillarious,Plot isnt great but still a sweet(sort of) movie....however you must watch it for the hillarious horse shows. Horse takes off with four white legs and lands with no white...riders change breeches mid stride....a star on another horse's face gets blown down to its muzzle... and Lightning changes breeds and variations of grey several times as well.
2,Okay.,"Well this is not the best movie the world, but what can you do. If all movie were great than there would be nothing to review. This movie is for someone who likes horse but not for all horseLOVERS! If you know a lot about horse this movie is not for you. I found 700 things wrong with this movie , afterwards I could enjoy it I think because I know so much about horses. I would just say to try to enjoy it!"
4,movie from my childhood,"If it wasn't from the 80's but was more current, the way it was made would be better, but i give it 4 and a hlf stars simply for being so damn old. I watched this movie ritualisticlly as a chilod. i absolutely loved it. I am trying to find it on DVD right now. No movie is perfect, especially if it is from the 80's. Who cares if the horse had one white sock before a jmp and 2 after? it doesn't matter. i hate people who think little things like that totally ruin a movie. it is a wonderful movie, especially for young riders. it has been 10 years since i last saw it(which is when i stpped riding) and now that i own a horse and an getting back into the horse world, all i can think about it getting that movie. it is absolutely wonderful!!"
4,Anderson's Solo Album Worth Hearing,"what should get five stars -- aqualung? Rupi's Dance is by no means an aqualung, or a roots to branches for that matter, but there are some fine moments to be sure: ""Lost in Crowds"" has the catchiest hook since ""Kissing Willie,"" ""Two Planks,"" and the ""Cappucino Song"" are great. MY POINT: If you're a Tull fan, this album should snuggle right in next to SLOB -- though SLOB was better (4 1/2?). Anderson follows his muse, and his classical/parlour flatpick strumming is well to the fore, not to mention some descent instrumental passages; this could have been a JT album if Barre had laid down some solos and a few crunchy rhythms. JUST BUY IT -- it definitely warms up after a few listens!"
3,so-so,"Re:>It's a popular notion that modern Jethro Tull and Ian Anderson solo albums are increasingly indistinguishable.Really? Whose notion is this? Does he realize that the very first Ian Anderson solo album wasn't made until after Jethro Tull had been recording albums for FIFTEEN years?>That argument may hold water from the narrowest of musical perspectives, but it's hard to imagine the obtusely [SIC] grandiose Tull...Does this reviewer realize that ""obtusely"" means ""stupidly""? Should amazon.com be hiring ""reviewers"" who don't know the meaning of the words they use?>Indeed it's hard not to be charmed by Anderson's gentle, often self-deprecating wit as he variously lusts after an international CNN anchor (""Not Ralitsa Vassileva"")...""Lusts after""? Has this reviewer actually LISTENED to this record?"
4,Not Tull,"This is not a Tull album, it has a ""World Beat"" feel to it that is outside the tull sound. I like this album a lot (raft of penguins in particular)and would recomend it highly!"
4,"Good, not great collection","There is a lot of fun stuff here, at a good price. Unfortunately quite a lot of the book is original stories, and inevitably they are not as good as some classics not included. But if you like locked rooms, there is no reason to hesitate about buying this."
4,Christmas Present,This was a Christmas present for my daughter. She is currently studying Criminal Justice and I thought she would like this book.
5,extraordinary music,"Although here in Brussels, we had to wait a while to be able to get the cd, it was worth the wait. What I love about this cd is that the songs seem to be very simple at the beginning, when in fact they are anything but. Each song has been carefully written, composed in a way that you discover new things each time you listen to it. Try and listen beyond the main melody in 'volcano' for example. The music on this album hasn't been forced. It feels like a very soothing, relaxed, confident music session. Edie Brickell has taken her time to make it, and that can be heard. Albums like this are very though. The more you play these special albums, the more ordinary they seem. The key is not to play the albums too much, even if that's all you want. That way, the beauty of the songs gets fully preserved!"
5,A sultry wel-comeback album,"When you hear the word ""Volcano"" you typically think of an explosive release of fiery energy. This album is more like a volcano before it erupts, a deep pool of superheated bubbling magma slowing boiling up to the surface.Some of the songs are fairly mellow, like ""Rush Around."" Others, like ""I'd Be Surprised""--which is a flawless gem-- express so much low-key, jazzy energy that they might best be described as sultry. Yet another song, ""The One Who Went Away"" is quietly haunting.The versatility of Ms. Brickell's voice always amazes. Add the subtle guitar backup of Charlie Sexton and you have a match made in heaven."
1,Am I the only one?,"I remember being extremely frightened when Edie married Paul. No, not what you're thinking. I knew he'd ruin her music. And I was right. Picture perfect was a big disappointment for me. You could hear his influence all over the place. If I wanted to listen to simon, I'd buy one of his records. Maybe I'm the only one but the rough sound of her early work and the lyrics were exactly what I liked about her. Ten years later and it's even worse. I don't hear any of the influences of her earlier work. Her trademark singing is gone. Who ever said she can't sing is dead wrong. She has a great voice. It's just not used at all on volcano. I liked the passion of her early work. Now I seem to hear exactly what you'd expect. A middle aged woman, married to someone who too heavily influenced her, singing about stuff I couldn't care less about and doing it without much passion.Oh well. Thanks Paul."
3,somewhat disappointed,"This was definitely an impulse buy for me. I happened upon it in the record store and was intrigued that Edie Brickell (wife of Paul Simon) and former member of a one-hit wonder band has come out with a solo album. I am a big fan of Charlie Sexton, so his involvement in this album kind of sealed the deal. I've now listened to the cd several times and I'm a bit disappointed. Really, it's not a bad album, but I don't think Edie has the vocal range for this type of a project. Yes, I agree that this cd is suitable for calming the nerves on the daily commute. But, it's not the sort of album I want to play on a high quality hi fi setup and get lost in beauty of her voice."
2,frustrating !,* Very Bulky* got damaged after a few month later* Heavy* poor support** FM recoder** Sound finger print** Built-in FM transmotter
5,Brilliant!,"So, you mean I can listen to ALL of my music whenever & wherever I want? I can broadcast them at any FM radio even in my car amidst the brodcast noise in LA? I can make voice and live music recordings? Yes, yes, yes! I'm still amazed how well the Neuros works. I haven't used my car's CD changer since!Neuros rocks, so does the price tag, especially if you've considered the ipod. This thing's all-in-one, no additional add-on or plug-in features for recording or broadcasting. Customer service is great as well as the on-line forums at neurosaudio.com. It hasn't left my side since it arrived! This is the MP3/Digital player to get!"
1,"Crashed and then burned, then crashed again.","The concept of this device is great. It was first foray into MP3 players. I found that it played well over the FM frequency, the earphones made the music seem like it was a live performance, ease of use was great with the synchronizing software and their customer service was beyond excellent, they were superb -- in their human relation skills, but I'm not sure about their technical skills. I'm giving it two stars because it seemed like the Neuros team really wanted to help me but the end result was that I was able to use it for only a few weeks of the five months I've owned it. I had to send it back to Neuros twice and it wasn't repaired either time. I am, just today, sending it back to them with instructions that they are to send me a completely different device or don't send me anything at all. It's already cost me about $75 in shipping costs to have them attempt to repair it. By the time it's over, buying an iPod might look like a real bargain."
1,Lack the basics.,"This player simply can't play mp3 files from the directory. Your pre-defined m3u playlists are ignored. You must use a sync manager, either the in-box NSM or some downloaded open source software, to build a database out of the mp3 ID3 tags. Otherwise the files simply won't play and there's no way around. This machine generated database mess up your existing file directory and you'll get nemerous strange playlists simply because they all have the same ""unknown artists"" or ""track 01"" etc. And don't expect Karajan and von Karajan appear as the same person unless you are ready to spend hundreds of hours editing your file tags.This issue applies to all Neuros mp3 players, even the newest 80G model. The Neuros users have been complaining about this since last year but nothing has ever been done up till now. I'm very disappointed."
1,Blew up on me.,"I'm a music junkie, have an iPod, but will try anything promising. I was very excited about using this to broadcast MP3's to a stereo (have bought similar low cost products that were really bad).Well, took it home, set it up, got some power, charged it....and it never turned on again.When I brought it back to the store, the clerck that saw me approaching him with the package gave me a look that read ""yep, another one of these back"", and when I talked to him, confirmed that they were coming back frequently.When I read the other reviews on this site though, it makes me want to roll the dice and try it again...Do at your own risk."
3,Book was a gift,"Though this book made my friend cry with happiness, there was a burn mark in the inside cover. I didn't have time to send it back and wait for a new one so I made a joke about it."
3,Only for people who are interested in reading it,"This book was part of the literature for my Sociology exam. My main field is not sociology and I'm not a native English speaker, so the book was pretty hard to read for me (the language used is not the easiest). I guess the author does a pretty good overview of the Theory in the previous century, covering most important thinkers in the field. For people who already have a background knowledge on the topics discussed, it will be interesting to read Baert's opinions about all the theories. The biggest disadvantage, a really bothering one, is that the author uses a lot (A LOT! Way too much.) of enumeration. There are lists of arguments on every single page and it's really easy to get confused with which list goes where and which list is within another list."
4,Mr. Zane apparently has no taste,"My friend owns this DVD and I came here to get my own copy. This DVD offers a great collection of varied artists' performances ranging from run-of-the-mill (only a few) to absolutely great (several). Included are performances by Yo-Yo Ma, Shawn Colvin, Charlotte Church (I think that's her name - the 15 year old singer), Stevie Ray Vaughn (Pride and Joy), his brother (I think it's his brother, singing Texas Flood), and many others.Shawn Colvin's performance is especially noteworthy, perhaps the best in this package. Must have for Shawn Colvin fans.Stevie Ray's performance is also excellent, as is the performance of Texas Flood included here by his brother.Yo-Yo Ma's performance opened my mind to the classical genre. Charlotte gives a good performance, though her music is not to my liking (I guess I like classical best without vocals).I'd love to review some more, but it's been over a month since the last time I viewed this DVD."
2,not so good,"This movie is not that entertaining. watched it with my boys and they were not that into it, but usually like Lego theme."
4,Lego Clutch Powers movie,This movie is great for the lego lovers. My 9 yr old son loves this movie as well does the whole family!
4,Fun and imaginative,We enjoyed it. It's one of those films that is fun without needing to watch it all.We had hoped it would be more like the Lego City Episodes with the police chief but it is not. We would like more of those.
4,Fun video,"My kids had already seen the movie, but they really enjoyed the little extra shorts that came with the DVD"
1,Region code,T T I can't play DVD because of region code. Maybe this can be played only in USA?Note about Region Code for this DVD.
3,My son loves it.. but I don't...,"I think Lego Ninjago and Hero Factory are better concepts than Lego City. The idea is really boring... my son loved it at first, but now he's stuck with Hero factory and Ninjago... just saying.."
4,4-year-old approved.,my four year old son loves it. I wish Lego would make more movies. He watched it again and again for the first few days and a couple times since. Streams well on the TV and on the Ipad.
4,Great video,This video is fun and entertaining to both my kids and me. It was fun to laugh with them and laugh at stuff they thought was funny. It was interesting and had some fun things that made me go hmmm. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes legos.
5,Great Buy,"My son was hoping to find this movies. When I found and purchased it, he was excited. I would purchase from this seller again."
4,Funny but gross,"This movie is funny but my daughter says its gross because ""the boy tries to kiss the girl because he likes her"" :)"
5,Awesome!,"Awesome movie... my kids 8 and 5 were captivated by it. And, they played along and had a blast. Truly recommend and cannot wait until any more come out!"
3,Mixed review from our family,6 year old boy who loves legos: Awesome! It was so cool.9 year old girl: It was good. I liked the actors.3 year old boy: Awesome.Mom: It was entertaining enough. I wish it was a dollar.Dad: I had to leave after 15 minutes. I don't feel bad about it and won't finish the movie.
5,Clutch Powers,My son absolutely loves this movie!!! He watches it over and over! Any child that loves Legos will love this movie!
5,Great kids movie,WHERE ARE MORE CLUTCH POWERS MOVIES??? My son and his friends would watch this daily if allowed! Lego needs to be doing more animation in movie length
5,Wonderful,My child was very excited to receive this product. Fast delivery was a big plus. The price was right and was what I expected. Thank you!
3,Too long to deal with!,"This book is way too long to give the reader the desire to sit down and tackle it all! Good information, but just too much of it!"
4,Don't buy until the company is back in business!!,"I am a Sportbrain customer from last year. The company is a dot-com that had a flawed business model and went belly up. My Sportbrain has been sitting in my drawer, totally useless without it's ""mother ship"" website to talk to.As of April 2002, the company is under new ownership and is planning to be back online in May or June. ...P>Because this device connects to the Internet, if the website is down, the product is useless. Do not buy until the site is up.I look forward to the site coming back up. I would give it 5 stars when the site is working. This is an awesome product and service--it was a very motivating exercise gadget. I even ""competed"" against my sister across the country to see which of us would exercise the most each day. Try doing THAT with any other device!I hope it's up soon!"
5,An Awesome Motivator,"I received my sportsbrain for Christmas. I have worn it every day since. It has motivated me to walk to and from work again. I also have used it for snow shoeing and cross country skiing. It is very accurate for all walking activities, less so for skiing. I even get credit for my walking around the work place. I absolutely love this product. I am buying my husband one too, and we are purchasing the heart rate strap. I highly recommend this motivating product, not just for walkers, but for anyone who wants to increase their activity level."
1,beware,"In theory, this is a great product. You wear the Sportbrain, download the information periodically, and use a website to record your hard work with all kinds of nice charts and graphs. IT's NOT THAT SIMPLE....... The object is of NO USE whatsoever without the website and it cost another $99.00/year-minimum (above the purchase price) for the privilege of using the website. Does that make sense to you?"
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!,THIS PRODUCT REQUIRES AN ONLINE MEMBERSHIP AND AN ACTIVATION FEE. THIS IS NOT CLEAR IN ANY PACKAGING OR PRODUCT EXPLANATIONS. EVEN THE WEB SITE DOESN'T GIVE A CLEAR PRICE. TRY FINDING IT!! TRY A DIFFERENT PRODUCT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY 14.95 A MONTH.
1,Heads up...,"As of October 2002, the website for his product is still not up. When it is, they will be charging a fee for it's use (according to the website)"
4,warning!,"First of all, I will say that this product is GREAT! But don't buy it now because the website is down. For how long I don't know. I hope it comes back soon but until it does, you will not be able to log in your steps which makes the product useless. Unfortunately but true, it is a great product and hopefully will be one again soon, I love mine and am angry that it doesnt work anymore."
5,Best Activity Motivator Ever Made,"I have had my Sportbrain since January and have more than doubled my activity level. Weight loss was not really a concern for me, but what a bonus, I have lost about 15 lbs. in that period of time. It's easy to use, just clip it on and walk, run, jog, etc. Then later in the day, place the Sportbrain into the port and upload the information to your personal website. You can track your steps daily, weekly, and monthly so you can see improvements. You can see information about distance traveled and calories burned and the site will display this information graphically.This device is perfect for people who don't have time to perform formal workouts. The idea is to make your whole daily routine more active, helping you maintain a healthy lifestyle.I wear mine everyday and don't know what I would do without it. Once you start using it, you will be hooked."
5,Perfect Christmas Gift,"I Love this thing,I was pleasantly surprised to find that my SportBrain is not a passive recording device. At first I thought it was just another fancy pedometer, but it's not. It's actually an activator. I have doubled the amount of exercise I do everyday just so I can go to my WebPage the company makes for me, and look at my progressOne of the features that really gets me motivated is how it compares my activity to people in my age group. So I am always determined to beat the graph. Not only that but the more I exercise I get, the more prizes and rewards I can win.The next item on my list is a Heart Rate monitor, because supposedly the SportBrain Records the information from any heart rate monitor and graphs it out for you. Cooool!"
5,Greatest motivator to get moving EVER,"I received my Sportbrain almost two months ago. I have more than doubled my activity level since then. The tracker is super easy to use and so lightweight its not noticable. The website has a great user interface and the absolute best customer support anywhere. The online forums are a great way to meet other people in the same boat whether you are a triathlete or a beginning walker. I am so hooked and I do not see the novelty factor wearing off anytime soon. Neither do the ""sportbrainers"" of 8+ months so I am not to worried!"
2,"Great idea,but......","This product is a great idea,but if you buy it you are taking a chance. The company is in trouble right now and the web site could be shut down and day now and if you have to use a 800 number to dail up your data from your sportbrain you cann't even use the web site now. Maybe someone will buy the company and things will work out,but for now save your money."
1,Might be nice if it stayed on your clothes,"I'm on my second SportBrain already. I lost the first one on the first day I wore it. I figured it must have been something I did worng, and plunked down another... for a new tracker unit.Since most of my suits don't have belt loops to tie it to, I had to safety pin it to my pants. I found it dangling at least 3 times in the afternoon. Then, when I got it home and clicked it into the SportPort, the plastic clip broke altogether.And THEN, I logged in this morning to find that it only counted 7 steps all afternoon yesterday. Huh?!?Customer service is the only thing that can save my opinion of this product now......"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT NOW. The website is down. The company is out of business. While the product was a great idea, and it worked for me, it is USELESS at this time. There is no readout display on the device and the only way to know how far you walked is to go to the website. Unless someone buys the company (and agrees to provide service to all present owners), your purchase will be like flushing money down the toilet. DO NOT BUY IT NOW."
3,JUST DO IT!,"sometimes the gadget are good and help motivating . People could very well track their daily effort with that one . Is it going to make a difference to your fitness life ? Only if you are ready and willing for it . And if you are , you won t need the toy. Just be active, eat well , and train your conscience to take repsonsability for your actions . A tracking device for your fitness steps is only avoiding the un-avoidable . TO BE FIT YOU MUST BE RESPONSABLE . but if the toy can teach you that , by all means BUY IT.DIANE"
1,Counts steps not heart rate!,"This is one of the worst products I have bought. Not only does it hook up to your phone system, it does work well. Hooking this up to a phone line is a stupid design; suggestion to the manufacture, sync-it buddy like palm, get with the times. The second is what it actually counts, steps. Check this out, I was on the treadmill for 50 minutes, pulse rate 126, 3.8 mph, and 3.22 miles distance. The treadmill calculation was 529 burnt calories. This is what sportbrain told me: distance 2.4 miles and 400 cals burnt, I WAS CHEATED! Well anyway buy yourself a heart rate monitor it works."
3,Good writing but don't expect a theology primer,"While a different Catholic wrote each one of the chapters, often with great style, this should not be a source for understanding what the Church teaches on the seven sacraments. Rather, these authors reflect on their own personal experiences regarding the sacrament that is their topic, sometimes bringing in Church teaching, but always concentrating on their own perspective. There are a few gold nuggets in these missives, but there are certainly plenty of times when the knowledgeable reader (regardless of where they fall on the orthodox-progressive scale) will get riled up. In any case, the thoughtful reader will want to be well grounded in the sacraments (try the Catechism of the Catholic Church) before setting out into these murky waters."
2,disappointed,"this set is a smaller, somewhat miniature version of the original set I had purchased at Target. I needed to double the set for a dinner party. the set arrived a day before the party (my fault) so there was no time to send the set back because even though the peices look the same online, they are smaller.if you are starting out with this set they are probably ok"
5,Good set for a low price,"Not much to say, I like the style. Have to be hand dried right away, otherwise your risking water spots. good size large spoons and forks."
4,"Simple, good",Great buy - we use this set daily and it hasn't failed us yet. Love the simple and modern design.
5,Well finished and solid. Great price!,"This flatware was ordered for my weekend home so I didn't want to spend much money on anything too fancy. This set looked great in the picture so I ordered it and was surprised to see the quality of finish, full size and solid feel of the pieces. This would be a good selection for everyday flatware that looks much more expensive than its price."
3,"knife is blunt, but they are well polished.","I dont love that the knife has no serated edge... it doesn't cut very well... even through bread. These are beautifully polished... some of the nicest 18/0 steel cutlery I've seen. The design is nice as well. If the knife were serated and the steel was 18/8 (more durable) , these would be perfect."
3,Misleading Description/ Product Features,"I chose to purchase this flatware because the product features said they were ""tarnish-resistant 18/10 stainless steel with mirror finishing"". Nowhere in the packaging is this stated. The only makings on the flatware themselves state they ate 18/c which means it is 18% chrome.I was led to believe the pieces were 18/10 which is 18% chrome and 10% nickel, the ideal makeup of a flatware set. I also saw that the mirror finish does not coat completely the area between the forks and the finish scratches very easily even though I wash them and dry them with a soft towel immediately after every use."
2,Great design.. but prone to brown spots...,"I purchased 2 sets. After searching and searching, I really loved the simplistic design of these. I washed them right out of the packaging and then noticed and (still do, whether hand washing or in the dish washer, these random brown spots show up). I've read this happens to stainless. So I guess I'll have to use STPP or (Sodium TriPolyPhosphate) to add to my detergent or buy something that does not contain this? Or wash them off after eating acidic things with them? I dunno, it's a shame because I didn't really think these were that ""cheap"". But I do love the design!!"
4,Practical and attractive,"I just wanted a basic silverware set for my apartment. These are nothing to write home about, but having used them for a year, I expect them to last many more. The design is clean, modern and utilitarian. The distribution of weight is just right for holding. The metal is very sturdy; after a year, none of the pieces have gotten bent, and I haven't noticed any scratches.Minor quibbles: I would have preferred a bit more differentiation between the two fork sizes, and likewise between the two spoon sizes. I would also have liked the knives to have more serration. (They're very slightly serrated, but not sharp).Still, all in all, this is a good set for the price. Don't expect any compliments on this silverware, but you won't get any complaints, either."
2,Not impressed - instant water spots and color isn't what I expected.,"I received the silverware set and, although I sort of like the shape, they are not what I expected. The very first time I washed them (hand washed right out of the box) and placed them upright in a drying rack they dried with a significant number of water spots. Maybe it's something I'm doing wrong washing them, but my older set doesn't dry with spots and I didn't do anything different. I even washed several of my old set in the same load and they're not spotted.Also, compared with other silverware sets on Amazon, this set is pictured as a darker color, but it's not. It has a mirror finish as described but in a standard silverware color, which is fine if that's what you want, but I was looking for something subtly different.Seriously not impressed with this set so far, not sure if I'll keep them."
5,Look good from the start,"Out of the box, the flatware looks great!It is a bit larger than my previous set by they look is sharp and clean.The items are described as being shaped in such a way to make cutting easier, scooping easier etc and when it comes to ice cream, the spoons are great!The set has a great feel in my hands and would buy again!"
5,Best Book Yet on Christian Leadership!,"Finally I have found a book that departs thoroughly from the corporate model of leadership and embraces fully a unique Biblical model! Blanchard here goes deeper than just leading -- he speaks of being a leader and growing other leaders. Spirituality in this author's approach is vital -- it is not something that appears to be a mere overlay on a secular paradigm.I love reading titles on leadership, but have long felt there was something much more than just a Christianized version of secular theory. Blanchard identifies and defines a uniquely Christian approach, and does so in a very clear, readable fashion. This volume is the best book on Christian leadership I have read to date!"
3,Very long!,The book has a lot of meat. It should have been broken down into more chapters. There is a lot to learn from Jesus in Ken Blanchard's view.
2,I'm not convinced,Jesus didn't promote any women to his board. There are better and far more relevant role models. Bob Geldof did far more for the poor.
4,Lead Like Jesus,"This book provides excellent foundation principles for any leader. The discussion of vision, goals and values is particularly valuable. It is a great book."
5,Excellent,If you want to get a clear prespective on how to relate and treat others and desire personal growth this is the book.
3,Unsatisfying ...,"This video is wonderful - for the first 50 minutes. Then the complexity of the relationship between Mark and Irene takes an unexpected turn and becomes rather disturbing. The filmaker skirts the issue by not exploring these complexities, and the video left me unsatisfied. Ultimately, I can't tell what the film maker was trying to achieve with this effort. It started out as a light hearted look at modern day mating efforts, switched to a focus on the film maker's own search, and finally Irene's unexplored psyche. Could have been great....."
4,Lives of gay porn actors,"Interesting, thought-provoking examination of lives of several male performers.It could have used some better-known individuals."
2,"Oh, this is still on!?","I'm a big believer in ""There's no such thing as knowing too much about porn."" However, this was just not as impressive as it sounded. It didn't need to be so long. It had dark, poor-quality lighting. It interviews many men, but I saw no men of color and no bears. Thus, it was whitetwink-centric.There's one thing I must give up to it: many say that gay porn mostly involves men being ""gay for pay."" These men here seemed strongly gay-identified. They did not seem to be doing it just for the money. You could find these guys in many a club, tearroom, or bar."
5,Great book,"I bought this book used (which was pretty cool) from Amazon. Book gives information about before baby is born and what the baby is going through on the inside, what they can hear. It is really amazing that babies/young children can learn two or more languages at once, this book explains how this happens. Lots more information on why babies do certain things, how they learn, how they see and what they see and when, little games to play with your baby to develop learning."
1,what a horriable piece of text...,"I must say that I am severly disapointed that a ""web designer"" can come in and try to categorize web design ""styles"".Foolish names like ""Paper Bag"" and ""70's punk rock""..... This guy made this book for kids who cracked photoshop and dreamweaver and want to make a site that has had thought put into it.shame on him and anyone who follows this book as some sort of refrence for style...this book makes me sick. bad bad new riders...just bad.THINK OUTSIDE THE BOOK OR BOX"
4,Great Ideas for New Designs,"Like most books of this genre, ""Fresh Styles"" is useful for those in the web design business and less helpful for companies and clients that are ecommerce focused. The designs are incredibly but are heavy on graphics, images, and other elements that are frequently not beneficial to business sites. However, the book does chronicle designs that are really innovative and beautiful to look at. Very artistic and creative styles that will push the world of web design forward which it really needs at this point in time (tiring of the standard 'portal' look that is so popular)."
2,intro to web design.,"Great for beginners- Awful for veteran web designers.This book has a great cover and because of this you'd think that this book would be jam-packed with images and new design ideas. Although it is probably a good jump start into web design and what's going on on the web, if you've ever visited K10k or any other site of the likes, you might as well pass on this cause you've probably seen this stuff before. In fact, half my friends could probably get their favorites published and it would be more insightful."
4,Very nice,"Stefy made their splash with the song ""Chelsea"", both featured in the movie John Tucker Must Die and in clubs across America with a bevy of hot remixes. Their debut effort, ""The Orange Album"", continues in the trend of 80's synth-pop in the vein of The Eurythmics' ""Sweet Dreams"".Singer Stefy Rae has a strong voice (a nice contrast to a lot of the breathy female vocalists who have been popping up everywhere) and she showcases it well across the 11-track album.The tracks are typical pop fare, dealing with love, loss, and acceptance. ""Orange County"" is about a young couple that deal with pregnancy and the real world a little too early.Luckily if you like grrl rock (like Le Tigre) or mainstream pop (like Pink) this album should do wonders for you. It may not be the best thing to be pressed onto metal and plastic, but it is definitely a cut above the rest."
5,guilty pleasure,"i dont know what it is, but i decided to buy this record the day it came out and the songs play through really well. if you dont like it at firsts, it grows on you very fast. call it stefy guilty pleasure."
2,Knockoff flash in the pan,"Sorry, but after their few tracks that got good play and some marginal press in late '06, they seem to be what they sounded like on a third spin: clones. Synth and a sound that is like bad Blondie dipped into No Doubt wax. file it next to your Divinyls CD as a reminder not to buy a CD after you were drunk at a party.Perhaps I'll eat these words, but... nah..."
4,A timely reminder!,"In this fast paced goal orientated world we live in, honour seems to be a forgotton word. the Hagakure is a great reminder of how it is to be honourable to others and yourself. We let both slide too much!"
1,Immaterial,"I wanted to like this book, based on the book's description, since I am intrigued by off-beat solutions to such 'standard' problems. However, I found it quite incoherent.The book intersperses a few smidges of science history (double-slit experiment, equation for special relativity, etc.) with (what I found to be) mostly unclear and poorly structured 'arguments'. When I got to the section on ""Light as an Intercellullar Medium"" I was glad the end of the book was near.As someone used to reading philosophy and quantum mechanics I usually feel at home with complex, mind-bending arguments. But, sadly, here I can find no coherence to the words on the pages."
5,The Last Hurrah,"I am a political junkie and love this movie, I first bought it in VHS form and when the DVD came out I had to have it. This is my all time favorite Movie. It is a must for all political junkies."
5,I guess I'm just prejudiced,"In my view, Spencer Tracy never made a bad movie. I watched this during the recent political campaign and the parallels drawn about how politics and politicians really work was amazing. It's a classic that should be in every library."
3,"Good performances, strange flaw","I agree with other reviewers who rate this as a three-star movie that it's historically interesting, has a great performance by Spencer Tracy, and is marred by outdated and stereotyped sentiment. In addition it has a major flaw on which I have as yet seen no comments. In the scene at Democratic headquarters where the votes are being counted, there are NO women. Women were increasingly active in politics after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, and during his first term (1932-36) Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Frances Perkins as our first woman cabinet member -- Secretary of Labor. It is bizarre that Director John Ford did not include women as active political workers in that climactic scene."
3,An average movie!,"I like this movie, because Basil Rathbone is a part of it.He plays so wonderful, like in his other movies.But ""The last Hurrah"" is a little bit of boring, too.On this DVD is no bonus-material, and for the price it'snot so good.It's only for fans of Basil, Spencer or the book!"
3,I keep renewing,"Every year I struggle with the decision but every year I end up renewing. I wish they didn't make it so hard to make up my mind. Online Address Book is by far my favorite feature. I keep it synced with my family, my cell phone, iPod etc and I can access it through the web from work.The iDisk is practical for sharing large files too."
3,.Mac ok,"Good- easy to set up web pages, web and pop access for email, good for simple backupsBad - no spam filtering of email, limited space on secondary family storage, Backup program pretty worthless for full backups"
3,"Good concept, but expensive","I like the integration of various services and the interface, but in today's world, where gmail anf yahoo offer almost 3 GB of storage for free -- $179 for the family pack that has 2 GB of memory is too steep. If you have ,mac email that you are commited to (like I am) buy it, otherwise there are other alternatives that are less elegant but much less expensive."
1,Pretty poor book,"This is a pretty poor book! I have been doing ASP development for 5 years and I found this book pretty useless.They have alot of code examples, but don't really tell you how to put them together into a project.This would definitely not be a good choice for someone new to ASP development."
3,Good book for beginner,"Quite a good book, but really only for beginners, all articles, tips, etc. do not really go in depth, so if you have already a little bit experience with asp.net, buy another book ...But maybe this is the problem with most of the books existing about asp.net at the moment ..."
1,Simply awful,"I just picked up this book yesterday and have already found numerous errors in the code samples.I was expecting advanced material but most of this is pretty elementary introductory stuff.On top of that, some of their designs are just plain stupid. For example, their ""technique"" of paging through large record sets using ranges of the primary key ID is just wrong wrong wrong. The technique won't work unless your entire record set consists of perfectly continuous IDs! It's absolutely incredible that they would foist such (...) upon us.Stay away from this one."
5,Can't do without it.....,"This is basically the 'next level'.....when you're finally finished with the basic understanding of the new DotNet paradigm and you really want to get started doing something for real - this is the book to get...From Validation, Code Techniques and ADO.Net all the way to Web Services, Mobile Controls and Performance tips - this book is worth its weight in gold."
1,Beware of Toshiba,"I sent my Toshiba Satellite to the company for warranty service and never got it back and the company has ignored all requests, including those by the Better Business Bureau."
2,Too big too heavy,1. difficult to carry around.2. the hinges will give in in some time due to heavy screen.
1,This book looks awfully familiar,"If you bought the original Flash Web Design book, you'll probably want to skip this version. This is merely an update. Flash 5 Magic is completely new content and Flash 5 Bible has loads of new stuff, but Hillman and co. took a break and just did some updated screenshots and an ActionScript chapter. Thanks goodness for book exchange policies."
2,Lame.,"Hillman Curtis is too ""artsy fartsy"" and not enough ""substance"". He busily quotes people he admires yet forgets to finish the projects he shows you and has omissions and errors. Forget this book and go for ""Foundation Flash 5"". You are better off getting a graphic design book or something of that nature as this book is just insufficient in tutoring flash and insufficient on it's own to teach creativity. About the one good thing it does do it show you how to keep your files small. Not worth $35.00 for that information."
3,Good but innacurate,This is my first flash book. I purchased the software and went through the included tutorials. This book is a good next step. I like the step by step approach but before marketing this book as a Flash version 5 book they should have tried doing the projects in the new flash. Many of the steps do not work correctly in version 5 and you have to figure out why. Also a proofread of two would have done some definate good.
4,a great book for beginners,"I waited on buying this book , but then took a look at my bro's copy and immediately got my own. The people writing some of the reviews are right, this isn't for advanced Flash artists, but all in all for a rookie like me it's been huge."
4,"great inspiration, but outdated content","I give this a strong four because it is teaching me how and why to animate...and for me that's more valuable, but some of the examples are outdated. You're probably better off with a FlashMX book at this point."
2,overdesigned,"I wouldn't listen to these guys when it comes to design. It's actually hard to read and find information because of their 'style'. And it doesn't look cool either. A lot of hot air, little substance."
2,waste of $,"I know there are people would love some of the tracks on this set but personally I think, they are lame selections. Just another way of making money on the old stuff... The 2003 version of this series - Decades has way better tracks. Maybe I just like the more exciting and up beat music... I am giving it a 2 stars for the 10% of its decent tracks."
3,wordy & heavy,A really uin depth book great for studying the person of Christ. The downside is it is a bit wordy and written in a way that you need to concentrate to stay with it!
3,OK,This is the 4th of a projected 7 volume systematic theology. My main criticism is that Bloesch tries to do too much. The books is only 250 pages (without end notes) and he discusses both the person and work of Christ. Some of the discussion is too short. He really doesn't have the space to discuss many relevant Biblical citations. The book's chapter on the finality of Christ is excellent though. The reader might want to supplement this with Oden's The Word of Life or O'Collins' Christology.
4,Good songs yet too familiar,"This CD has some really great songs. I love particularly the one that was released as a single, ""Another white dash"" ever since I heard it on MTV's Advance warning. However, this singer offers few new things. Many of her songs sound like pre-sellout Liz Phair. If you like the genre of angry-chick music (ranging from Ani and Liz to Fiona and Tori), this is a fine representation of the genre (I actually love the genre and that is why I gave four stars). If not, probably you would be better off avoiding it, since there is not much else to listen in it."
3,Generic,"I enjoyed Butterfly Boucher's take with David Bowie on Changes, so checked out this CD. She's got her hippie first name, she plays all the instruments except drums on the music, and she writes an arresting lyric from time to time. But for me at least, the sound here -- whether uptempo pop or ballad -- is both generic and pretty repetitive from cut to cut. I burned three cuts -- Can You See the Lights?, Never Leave Your Heart Alone, and Busy. They are the best of her sound and, in my book, enough."
4,Don't Flutter by this one,"Have you ever had this CD that you kept going back to and listening to again and again, even though you didn't think you liked it that much? This CD fits that bill for me. I listened to it once all the way through and I liked a few of the tunes. I listened to it again and some of the songs I was so-so on before clicked into place. I keep going back to this CD because the songs keep calling to me. Her style is a bit edgier than Dido or Beth Orton so if you want ballads and slow pop this probably isn't your thang. It seems like all the tracks on this CD were handcrafted with exquisite precision. It's good stuff all over. Buy it!"
5,Album of the Year,"I first heard of Butterfly Boucher when it was announced she was opening for my favorite artist Sarah McLachlan. I went out and immediately purchased her cd not knowing anything about her. I fell in love with it at first listen. Butterfly played all of the instruments you hear on the cd as well as wrote all of the songs. From the catchy first single ""Another White Dash"" to one of my favorite cuts ""I Cant Make Me Love You"".....its an amazing album from a truly gifted artist. Butterfly will be touring the states by herself this fall. Try catching her in small clubs before everyone else catches on!!"
5,Great Live and Great CD,"I saw Butterfly Boucher last night as the opening act on Sarah McLachlan's tour. She was so incredible, I bought the cd before leaving the concert. I think a lot of her talent is covered by studio production on the cd (can never compare live to recorded...live is so much more powerful), but I consider this cd a smart addition to any collection. She uses unique phrasing and slightly different melodies that, when combined with the alternative/female rock sound that is popular, make this a definite need-to-buy album."
5,Why do I like this record so much?,"There must be a reason. Twelve catchy songs, always pleasant to the ears. There are many sound effects characterizing each song, introductions and choruses. There are sensual, soft vocals that made all the stuff sound mellow overall. ""Flutterby"" is a lovely bunch of songs gathered together, nice ballads included. That CD sounds apparently like your average radio pop, but is not. It's actually the kind of record that makes you love pop music again, for its freshness and creativity. This record is really good from start to finish, when one can hear the good pop stuff going on. Butterfly Boucher is a great talent."
5,Boucher Like Voucher,"I'm not one to write reviews and all, but I guess you can say I was inspired. I was one of the many who saw Butterfly open up for Sarah McLachlan, and yes, this rookie knows how to put on a show, and she's only going to get better as she becomes more comfortable in her element. Her music hooks you, but it's also her personality that truly shines through. She's talented, adorable, and she's grateful. Not to mention, she came from a humble background, so she seems to be basking in the spotlight right now as her dreams are becoming a reality rather quickly. Butterfly's having a blast, and it rubs off on you through her music and her live performances. She IS star material. She WILL become famous. There's no doubt about it, and her fire and spunk will rocket her to the top, and soon, she will be a household name. And then, everyone will know how to pronounce her name. I highly recommend this album...support a true artist."
4,Great for a first disk,"I had a friend who loved to play Boucher's last cd in her car, and she told me how she didn't like the last one a lot because of the whole ""90s girl band"" feel, so I was a little wary of purchasing this disk. But it ended up being pretty amazing, especially as it was Boucher's first attempt at the time. Totally recommend"
4,Only if you need a printed Java reference,A brief but good reference of the JFCs. Again none of language features are covered in dept so don't expect this book to be a tutorial or an introduction to Java. Buy it together with another title that has more hands on examples.
4,Disappointing quality,"It's great to see this show finally released on DVD. It's fun to introduce my kids to some of these great old shows that I watched growing up. However, the video quality is a disappointment. This show deserved some remastering and cleanup. It looks like it was put out in a hurry just to make a few bucks. Thanks to Shout! for finally putting it out, but come on, you can do better than this."
2,"Nostalgic, fun program gets a poor quality DVD release","Like so many others I waited years for this program to finally get a DVD release. Grizzly Adams is a fun series that reflects the tenor of its time. The 1960s and 1970s brought growing concerns about the environment and those concerns were often mirrored in popular culture. This hokey series was a reflection of that time. Unfortunately, CBS completely botched this DVD release. The quality is terrible. The episodes are usually washed out, with miserable sound mixes and hundreds of imperfections of every type moving across the image. I will not be buying season two because I do not wish to support this kind of lazy release. CBS should be ashamed. . .after so long fans of this program deserve some basic level of effort. I do not recommend the 2012 CBS DVD set."
5,Fantastic Show,I watched The life and times of Grizzley adams when I was a child and love the serial very much
2,GREAT show...TERRIBLE quality!!!,They finnaly released this terrific show on DVD but they should have cleaned it up a bit. Picture is terrible and at times completley horrible. This is no way to treat such a wonderful proram. At least the price is reasonable!!!
3,Disk Problem,The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams:Season OneDisk not loading properly. Would love it if it worked properly which it has not.
5,Great show!,It is wonderful they came out with this on DVD and hope the rest of the seasons come out as well. Thoroughly enjoyed watching these all over again...so many fond memories.
3,Great to relive my yonger days.,"Grizzly Adams was a part of my family's TV schedule. It was a good show, that everyone enjoyed. It's great to see the episodes again.However the tansfer wasn't that great. It's like watching it on a UHF channel that the reception was just okay. Not enough to deter me from recommending it or purchasing season two. But in todays age I hoped for a better picture."
3,"Great Series, No Excuse for Such Poor Quality Editing","I was absolutely delighted to find Grizzly Adams on DVD - at last! The series is exceptional, as any Grizzly Adams fan would likely agree. The picture, however, is extremely grainy and there is no excuse whatsoever for this. Modern technology can clean this out of the rough and have it shining like the diamond it is. What a disappointment that the company claims to have done this and very obviously has NOT."
5,Very exciting music!,"This is a very enjoyable CD, not just for bass players, but for any musician. The music on the CD, in my opinion, is fun and showcases the bandleader's outstanding writing abilities: the CD contains music that, inspite of the display of virtuosity by the players, is not what you would expect from a ""typical"" bass virtuoso CD, full of 132nd-note-filled solos and unintelligible fast runs all over the place. It's clear to me that the music is lyrical and melodic, and the bass solos show the development of an advanced melodic concept throughout the disc. The pianist is outstanding, the drums are awesome, the writing and playing of Mr. Berlin are phenomenal. Personal favorites: Have you heard Mispucha, Everybody gets old, Intermezzo and My Happy Kids. I highly recommend it."
4,Douglas A-20 Havoc and Boston,"This is a very detailed book. It deals with just about every phase of the aircraft. The book begins with bios on the engineers who designed the A-20 or DB-7. Included are French versions, Russian and or Foreign lend-lease versions. A nice chapter on service with US Army Air Forces includes the 3rd Attack Group (The Grim Reapers) during W2 in the Pacific. This book has a lot of very informative photos describing virtually all phases of this aircraft including uses after WW2.Appendix include A-20 specifications,Engines used on the DB7/A-20 Series and a production list that associates the contract numbers with serial numbers and contract dates. Physically, it is a well made book. The only draw back is that it only has 176 pages. At the new 2007 price of fifty dollars it is a very expensive book considering it's size. I bought it before the new price came into effect. If I had to pay the new price it would be a very hard decision and I am not sure it is worth that much."
2,Conair Straightner,"I got this a year ago and keep it as a ""backup"" in case my good one goes out. I have wavy hair that is medium in thickness, medium length. This gives me a, ""we can tell you tried hard with your straightner"" look. I have tried using the hottest setting in small sections and pulling my hair straight with it. All I get is this frizzy, super dry, weird kinda straight hair. I can't imagine how bad this must be if you have curly or dense hair.The only way I can pull a decent style with this is if I use high end hair products (straightening cream and shine spray) and do it the night before. Invest in any other one worth even a bit more with a good return policy."
4,Decent acedemic essays.,This collection(very uniquely arranged) is as good as a collection of acedemic theology essays can get. Although similarites between Christianity and Buddhism is one of my favorite subjects..this book didn't exactly blow me away. What it did do was allow me to read some critiques of each religion from practitioners of the other. I disagreed with some of the points made in some of the essays....but that makes me like the book even more. If you are even somewhat interested in comparative religion you should check this book out. I gave 4 stars!
4,Before you buy...,"The dishes look solid white in the picture, but they actually have an off-white grooved pattern. Also the mugs are much larger than the picture would indicate. Still, they are nice dishes and I'm not sending them back."
1,Wrong bike mount for Meridian,"At first I was puzzled by the other review because my Magellan bike mounting bracket fits perfectly w/ my color Meridian. Looking at the picture, I see that it's different than the one I ordered. For the Meridian gps unit, try searching Amazon for ""Magellan Meridian Bicycle Mounting Bracket"" to get the right one."
1,you are never able to buy it,"You cannot buy the lamp,cause the seller always tell you there is zero in their stock!I wonder why they put the item on Amazon?"
4,Muriel's Wedding Still Holds My Attention,"I first saw Muriel's Wedding several years ago and found it to be funny, sad, uplifting and unique. It still holds my attention even after all these years. An added bonus is that I was/am an ABBA fan so the movie soundtrack is great."
3,ok.,If you like romantic comedies this movie was ok. I really like Toni Collette but its not her greatest movie.
5,An excellent film,"Muriel's Wedding is everything all rolled into one: comedy, drama, musical ...Originally released in 1997, it stars Toni Collette as Muriel, a frumpy 20something girl who still lives at home with her dysfunctional brood. Her father loves to remind her of how worthless she is. Her mother is a shell of a human, and her siblings are all about as successful in their lives as Muriel.One day Muriel takes her life into her own hands and from that moment on, she begins a personal journey to find out who she is, which ultimately brings her back full circle to confront the truth in herself and her family. You will laugh, you will cry, you will grow to love Muriel as she learns to love herself.Also starring Rachel Griffiths (of Six Feet Under), as Muriel's best friend Rhonda.Featuring just about every known Abba song, Muriel's Wedding is a can't miss movie."
1,Less than 1 Star,"This item is extremely misleading. This little violin is NOT a student violin. It is exactly like the little plastic violins sold in discount stores only much more expensive. This is a toy. It is plastic, the strings are plastic, no way it can be tuned to ANYTHING, wouldn't play a note and is totally useless except as a toy. The ONLY thing useful on this purchase was the case. Definitely do not recommend and if you are looking for a true student violin, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Challenging listening,"A virtuoso, & I'm a big fan, but this is very challenging listening. His ideas transcend those of mere mortals, & I hope he achieved his goals with this project, but for most people who are interested in hearing him shred on more accessible material, this will be a disappointment."
4,One of the best guitarists today.,"I rate the CD 4 out of 5 ONLY because the video version is better. The CD tracks were edited from several live performances, which is fine. However, I prefer the live spontaneity. Vai has long been a favorite of mine, and has had a lasting impact on the guitar world. Every serious guitar player, regardless of their personal tastes and style should be familiar with him."
5,My four year old LOVES the Ohmies!!!,"The story of their journey to see the sun is interesting, the songs are catchy and my four year old loves to get up and do all the yoga poses with them! I find myself singing the songs constantly! I love the Ohmies!!"
4,"Enjoyable, but could use more inn content","This is a lovely little book, with beautiful illustrations and recipes. I very much enjoyed the descriptions of renovating and running the inn and life on the island ... but the author kept going off on tangents about the evils of war, the government, etc!"
3,very much an introduction,I found this book nice to read but pretty poor in terms of practical information. If you're looking for material to waffle at a VC it's all here but don't expect to sit down and start writing applications after reading it...
1,"poor focus, poor structure","The main problem with the book is it's lack of focus. It's neither a book for business people trying to value ebXML, it's neither a book for technical people trying to get more detail about ebXML.The business intro is poor. It's a collection of trends without much structure or insights.The technical part is mainly an intro.I was disappointed. Is mainly my problem, but I would advise future buyers to look for more focused books."
5,Rewiew of TOB-160 Toaster Oven,"I own the TOB-160 Toaster Oven. This a well built little oven Works very well in all functios. I have read reports of Broilerpan warping, I do not have this problem however, you must follow thedirections and leave the door ajar in the broil mode, the onlyobjection to this item it's a little small."
1,Poor Toaster,"I can't rate it as an oven, because I haven't tried it yet. I can say that it's a lousy toaster. Extremely uneven (fine on one side, ""raw"" or burnt on the other). I was very disappointed in product performance and plan to return it. Choose another if you're looking for a good toaster."
5,GREAT SECOND OVEN,"This is a great oven for 1 or 2 people household. I do all my roasting in it. I very seldom use my large oven. The only item I would not use this oven for is Pizza.This oven browns toast beautifully, reheats, roasts, cooksanything and everything. I cannot say enough about this appliance. This is my second one...."
3,Talk about disparate stories .....,"This is a collection of 15 stories by the same number of authors ... Only two, like Lisbet Sarai, the editor, and Portia Da Costa are known to me and proven master authors in erotic writing. Most of the authors have some kind of involvment in erotica like Lidia Swartz who runs a millerswork.com website of stories and videos to Simon Sheppard who wirtes gay erotica in San Francisco ... of course, where else ..I did not enjoy the book because it really really covers a very wide area of BDSM and erotica that it probably has a target market covering everyone in the world ...."
3,Adorable but the size is way off,"Took the advice of other reviewers and ordered up a size. Should have ordered up two or more sizes! Other than that, its adorable, well made and very stylish. Perhaps the company should reevaluate their sizing system, or offer a chart with exact measurments so one can order the correct size."
4,Nice jacket,"Bought it for $30 in dec '06. Great product. i have bought atleast 5 jackets from this brand.. the only bad thing about this jacket (if bought in light color) - gets dirty easily. I felt its more dust prone than other jackets i have bought in past. Other than that, i love the hood and the casual look. PS: Dont expect brandan thomas jackets to be as good as those branded ones in market... but good deal for the dollar amount."
3,100 love songs,"thanks for the product it was in good condition ,but it wasnt what i was looking for ,i thought the songs were song by the original singers ,anyway its not your mistake ,you did your job the product is in good condition"
1,arrived with the mirrors fallen off,"Several of the small pieces of mirror had fallen off during shipping. The product does not appear to be made well. The plastic casing is also very cheap. I guess it's ok for a teenagers room, but too tacky and cheap for most purposes."
1,OVERPRICED & CHEESY,"I can't beieve I paid $20! The ""cleaning mit"" is actually a sack that you're supposed to stick 3 fingers into and somehow clean with then. (?) The small cloth wasn't much better, leaving behind a lot of dust. Zipper case is flimsy and doesn't open all the way."
4,Little Chapel on the River,"My book club here in N.J. read this book, and we are about one hour from Garrison, N.Y. We all loved the book, so at out meeting after reading the book we decided to go there. We met the owner, and the lawyer, and ordered sandwiches for lunch and sat outside the little store on picnic benches and ate. It overlooks the Hudson River, and the view was just awesome. We all had some great conversations with those two men. I also have a friend in Florida who claims that the town of Garrison was named that because of her ancestors. She was so interested in hearing my story."
5,BEST BOOK I HAVE READ. PERIOD.,"I will not make this long & drawn out. My simple review is this. If you enjoy reading not a good book, but a GREAT book.....READ THIS BOOK. I just loved it and have been cleaning out book sellers copies to send & give to friends. Thank you Gwendolyn Bounds for one fantastic journey.David RogowayLake Oswego, Oregon"
5,***ALREADY RELEASED ON DVD***,"This title is not available alone on DVD but you can buy ""MAKE MINE MUSIC"". This is an old title from Disney and it includes ""Peter and the Wolf""."
5,Peter & the Wolf,"This is a very old story, set to music by Prokofiev. It was adapted by Disney as one of ten segments of the animated feature film, ""Make Mine Music"" in 1946. Narrated by Sterling Holloway (the voice of Pooh) it is the story of a young boy who goes with his pet cat Ivan, duck Sonia, and bird Sasha to catch the wolf. The music has always been a popular way to teach people the value of classical music, and how music can be expressive and teach a story. Each animal and person in the story is expressed by a musical instrument, such as Peter by a string quartet, Grandpa by the bassoon, and the hunters by kettledrums. The piece is hilarious and very well animated. It was edited into a short featurettte for the first time in 1955.This particular VHS tape also has two cartoon shorts, Music Land and Symphony Hour."
2,Not what I wanted.,I wanted a DVD. Donated this to the library. Perhaps they can use it. Why do you not have this on DVD?
2,An Oldie But A Goodie !!,As a child I loved this video - My 3 year old neice has watched it over and over. It also teaches something about musical instruments and how music can tell a story.
4,Love the book!,"Cretan Cooking is a great book. It includes information on why the diet is healthy, along with great photos to go with the recipe. If you're looking for an authentic Cretan Diet, I think this is a great book! I feel healthy every time I make something out of it!"
1,Impossible to Enjoy,"We can only hope that the impending hardcover editions in the ""Essential"" series will be full size and in color. If you are considering purchasing any of these titles I would wait, because the mini black and white format makes these impossible to enjoy. The art, in the case of Jack Kirby's work in particular, is crowded and busy without the color to seperate the lines. To see this sort of thing done right, check out ""Superman in the Sixties""; 19 stories, soft cover, full size, color and affordable.It's too bad Marvel didn't do it right, as their product from the sixties is far superior to D.C.'s."
5,Loved it,Awsome book nearly done reading it. Great condition. Never knew there was a Ant man & wasp woman in it.
3,"Decent, but kinda repetitive","Loon's debut album seems to reveal his potential, however after listening through all of the songs the same lyrics about relationships with women comes up in song after song. While saying that I have to say songs like ""How U Want That"" ""Things that you do"", ""This Ain't Funny"", ""Waiting"" and ""Down For U"" (which i think could be titled ""I Need a Girl Part 3"") are all tight. However, i had downloaded ""Up in a Maze"" and ""Ain't No Gangsta"" last spring and was disappointed to see they didn't make the album. They could've brought a different flavor to break up the continual songs about relationships with women. But Diddy probably realized that Loon isn't a gangsta so why should he sing about it? If you liked Loon on any of his cammeos then you will probably like this album, if not, don't expect anything new from Harlem's latest bad boy."
2,Read This,"I hate pretty boys, and I hate when they make albums about being a pretty boy. In short, f*** Loon."
2,diddy said he won't stop,I would'nt call loon a mase clone simply because there was'nt nothing special about mase' style and since biggie's death bad boy has survived mainly because of p diddy anyway really diddy could have did these songs himself it's an average pop rap sounding cd with the usual raps that mainstream accepts with the usual r&b singing cats who sing a few hooks really not that interesting.
4,Off da hizzle,"Loon, great album, spot on, does his thing, doesnt sound like Mase or Fabulous, but does bite a few of Big's lyrics which is a bit disappointing. Still its a hot album, one you need in your life. Stand out track, 'How you want that?' featuring Kelis - this track settles any arguments that Loon is a Mase copy-cat, 'Down For Me' the current single is hot like that, 'Like a movie' is buck wild and so is 'Story' which I must say has a similar concept to Big's 'I got a story to tell' but Loon still holds his won, 'Waiting' is ridiculously off the hook, so is 'Between Us', 'This aint funny' samples a song by Slick Rick but still sounds nice, 'Cant talk to her' has great production and a lazy but genius flow."
2,Nothing Special,Down 4 Me and I like remake and thats it like I said b4 2 stars 2 songs! but this cd is not more a Puffy style cd (Puffy is F-ing his own record label up and it hasnt did s... since BIG died) good for bad boy collectors not good for admirition
4,Good album good club beats!!,"This cd has really good beats and lyrics that seem to flow with little effort. Loons flow is perfect and he really keeps the energy high during the whole cd. This is a good cd you can pop in during a party and vibe to!! Some good songs are ""How you want that"" and ""Do what you like feat Trina"" This song has got a bad ass beat and smoooooth flow. Also ""Down for me feat. Mario Winans."" This song is flawless with perfect flow and an even better beat. There are lots of other good songs a great buy pick it up!!!!!!"
2,You Guys Lied To Me,I bought this album because of the raving reviews people were giving the loon album and decided to buy it for myself...But I must say this is the worst cd I have ever heard period..His flow is wackHis rhymes are wackHis wordplay is awfulHis delivery & presence is garbageThanks guy u help me find a perfect cup holder
2,Nothing new.....,"Pure commerce! Loon is nothing original, it's just another weak protege of Didy, and he's really plastic. Guy has no flow and his voice is really monotonous. Only the beats and hooks (like kelis in 'How You Want That?') save this album from being a trash. Lyrics are standart s**t about being player, rocking mercedes and ferrari, having sooooo much casdh (but who cares 'bout that?). Give me a break. It's 2003 and time to go forward. The problem wit' Loon is that, he's not creating ideas,he just performing ideas of Puff daddy. Weak record."
2,2 Stars,"Loon is a wack album. The Bad Boy legacy is forever tainted with this album, Diddy should have invested more time in a second Black Rob or G. Dep album instead of making this weak attempt at a rapper sex symbol bull. There is only one LL Cool J and no one else can do that type of music without being laughed at. NOT RECOMMENDED."
5,The best album to provide spiritual hope- ever.,"Have you ever felt tired of your present situation? Are you suffering through a trying time? Do you feel lost, alone, or rejected?Buy this album."
3,the TV program sucks,"I bought this computer so that I can replace my heavy TV/DVD set from my work bench. However, I was totally disguised by watching TV for even one second on this computer. the resolution is so bad that you can't even recognize the faces. the DVD works perfect....I would have instead buy this model without TV turner and have saved $400 to buy 17'' flat panal TV."
4,Great Laptop. Carefull with TV option,"Hello. I love this machine, You should know that the TV receiver can only be used without the battery, (the module goes in that bay) so you MUST be plugged to an outlet. Also needs an external antennae conection (includes conector) The Remote Control for the media center is quite nice BUT you need to attach an IR receiver (also included) to one of your USB ports so this is not that practical after all... Great buy, but I just wanted you to know what I did not when I ordered... :)Awesome screen, very useful."
3,Cold Fusion: Fire from Water,The audio portion of this video was excellent. The video portion was jumbled with bad ghosting. I would have rated the video 5 stars if I could have watched the video along with the audio. I tried it on two different VHS VCRs with the same results. On slow play the video portion came in excellent but with no sound. Same thing on fast forward. Regular play had the audio coming in great but with the picture ghosting into two images of everything. I don't know if this was an anomally caused by this particular tape or if is copy protected and my VCR won't play it properly or what.
2,You get what you pay for!,"I bought this book while just beginning XML development. I would say that this book is better suited for management types to read to get a high-level overview of the XML technology. It did not offer much as a ""pocket reference"". Most people will find money better spent on books describing the supporting technologies that go with XML, like XSLT, Schemas, and XLink."
4,"Small, handy, but a bit dated","This book is great for quickly looking up almost anything XML-related, sort of a pocket XML-English dictionary. Excellent if you have to travel (I took my copy to London in my laptop bag). However, I found that the XSL section is missing descriptions of several elements that have been added to the specification since the book was published a year ago."
4,Oreilly scores again,"This is an excellent quick reference quide. While other publishers are scratching their heads trying to figure out what XML is, Oreilly gets the info on the street in timely fashion. Hopefully they'll following up with one of their ""Definitive Guides"" to XML soon."
3,"Useful, But Better Option Exists","This book is small and travels well. It does not have an index, which seems odd for a reference text, but it does have a table of contents. I find Essential XML Quick Reference (ISBN 0-201-74095-8) to be well worth the additional investment."
5,Best XML Book I've Read,This is a great book. Its 97 pages of information that is well presented and easy to understand. This was a great book that all XML developers should buy.
5,Great reference,"This book delivers exactly what you'd expect from a pocket reference: concise introduction, thorough listing of the features, and some practical examples of how to use the information presented. And, unlike the HTTP Pocket Reference, it has an index so you can find things quickly.Well done!"
1,Obsolete!,"This would be a great book due to its economy of words and straightforward approach, however the bulk of the book -- which deals with DTDs and XSL -- is so far out of date with the W3C that the entire book is essentially irrelevant. A pity."
1,Inconsistent and non-functional,"I'm guessing that the high ratings were by friends of the author and publisher. Sorry Robert Eckstein, time to come clean! The very first example in the book won't work, no matter what you do, and Robert has a hard time keeping consistent names going between ""Simple"" and ""Sample."" If you're new to XML you will NEVER learn it with this book. Even being familiar with XML, you'll NEVER use it as a reference. This book has no value to anyone."
3,Who is this book aimed at?,"Before buying this book, question yourself: how much XML do I really know? If you are a relative newbie to XML, this pocket reference doesn't go into enough detail to really get you up-to-speed on the inner-workings of XML (like DTD's, XSL stylesheets). If you know XML pretty well, those bigger, thicker books you used to learn XML are going to be more in-depth than this reference and will contain the same information, just more of it to thumb through.I bought this pocket reference along with Harold's XML Bible. The XML Bible may be 1,000 pages, but it has the same information as the pocket reference and an index, so it's just as easy for me to look up a topic among those 1,000 pages. I gave the book three stars because it does summarize XML quite well, I just can't seem to figure out who the intended audience is."
3,This is a beginners book...,"I can't possibly imagine that this book will be of any value to someone working with XML on a daily basis. It should be renamed to ""a terse introduction to xml"", as it is in no way a reference. This is based on the fact that I bought it to learn XML from, and it was quite good at teaching someone with no experience in XML whatsoever the basic concepts.If you are looking for a reference, look elsewhere. If you are just like me, and don't want to wade through hundreds of pages to get an idea of what it is all about, then you can perhaps consider it. Since it is so wrongly named, I give it three stars. But as an introduction it really deserves five."
3,"not bad, but better books exist","I read about 50% of this book and tried to work out the examples. However in the first chapter alone I found three errors. Two were corrected on the website, and I can't remember if the third one was too. This is a first edition, so watch out. XML development moves really fast, so a lot of things are no longer the same. The book explains things well and succinctly. But I would use it only after reading another book with more thorough treatment. I own several XML books, and quite frankly, I found that Professional XML (by Wrox) is the best book in the field at the moment. I confess to referring to this book still, but only after understanding the only concepts from Professional XML and other books. Consider buying this as a supplemental reference, but it should not be your first purchase."
3,Good book but no coverage for XML schemas,"I guess it's my fault for not checking closely enough, but this book is somewhat dated now (more than two years old as of this writing). It was somewhat of an impulse buy at the book store when it looked useful after a quick scan. It had a little ""2nd Edition"" banner across the front cover corner and I just assumed it included coverage of schemas. The coverage of XSLT and XML in a small format is quite useful. I'll probably buy the 3rd edition when it comes out--I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars two years ago when it was first published."
5,Great taste,My daughter loves all of the Little Critter products. She is allergic to every artificial food color so it is difficult sometimes to find products that she can take. Little Critters never have artificial colors so it is not a problem. They are soft and tasty so she loves taking them. She actually asks me every morning if she can have her vitamins!
1,A straw man,Hart's representation of the religious right is a straw man. It must come from his legalistic Nazarene tradition and personal experience or his own prejudicial rendering of how he perceives the threat from those involved in American politics with more conservative religious and political points of view than his own. The liberal left has lost influence and political turf in recent years and this is his scare tactic approach to win some back. The book is a good attack against the Al Queda like efforts of an insignificant few in our culture to impose their views on society but is a futile effort to counter the larger movement of the right in their efforts to oppose the liberal socialist agenda. The book fails to convince or even cause serious reflection of another viewpoint. I was hoping for a compelling presentation to advance a mutual understanding of the issues. This book fails miserably.
4,Review,This book says you all about Firewall & Internet Securities. This is written comparatively in easy language and is useful also to non technical persons.
1,conceptually nothing,"Written in I believe 1995, maybe their ideas were current then? This book should be given to customer service reps who aspire to better jobs and not anyone who has any technical skill whatsoever should read this book. You start flipping pages because its so basic, then you flip chapters. Ick. Besides the fact that some of the information is simply wrong."
3,"Okay for discussing general ideas, but not much real world","Okay for discussing general ideas, but not much real world use. There's not a lot to be had from this book. They cover too much and discuss too much generalized topics and never really touch on any real-world working, intelligent firewall fules and uses. Just too much generalized fluff. You'll get more from a 'man page' on iptables and be able to put it to use, at least, compared to this. It is interesting, but there's too much generalization and fluff and not much someone can *use* from it."
3,a long time coming,"""boo & gotti finally get there chance to shine,don't they man"".the album feats.production by chi-towns kanye west, cmr jazze pha and of course mannie freezie.my first thought was that they would destroy dope beats with juvenile(no pun intended)lyrics,but to my surprise they actually have decent lyrics and good hooks.i also like how the didnt follow the trend of a lot of new rappers and have a album that sounds like a compilation with all the guest appearences,besides there cmr family r kelly and of all people blackchild are featured on the album.stand out songs are ""aint it man"" the single ready ""baby girl"" and the 70's funk track ""out here"".they also show there love for there city twice on tracks chi-town and chicago.despite the long delay and label change boo & gotti managed to put together a good album.if your a cash money fan or enjoy topics of sex money and drugs youll like this one i give it 3stars"
4,"How I Make $100,000/year in the Music Business",A practical and truthful book about the music business. Filled with valuable ideas and possibilities for people who really want to make it in the music business.
3,wow,i actally havnt read the book but it sounds good i just wanna know if there is any way of getting the book with out having a credit card cause i know this book is what i need to get my music heard thanx
4,"Easy to read, helpful information","This book is very helpful to those not familiar with the music business and is encouraging rather than overwhelming. While some of the tips are just basic common sense, it is good to be reminded about how important some of those basics are. David Hooper and Lee Kennedy stress the importance of keeping a level perspective on the business which I think it the most helpful idea that I took from this book."
4,A book not to go without in these times...,"If you are in the industry you know the times are changing. This book by David Hooper and Lee Kennedy empowers the individual to do something about their career. Written with common sense, excellent advice and clever ideas, this book is not to go without in these times.If you are already out there doing it on your own, then you still may want to review Hooper and Kennedy's words. You never know what piece of advice you find that sparks the missing link to your superstardom!"
5,Great book for all levels of musicians.,"Whether you are in a band or just play solo, this book is packed with information you can use. You will be able to start to apply the techniques mentioned in this book right away and will see a difference in your bottom line within the month. We sell a lot more CDs thanks to this book. Gig attendance is also up."
5,Useful book for musicians with small budgets,"I got David's book, awesome, thank you for creating something that is realistic and has already been done by somebody. I bought Tim Sweeneys book and although there is pertinent good information in there, a lot of it is also meant for bands with large budgets. I found your book to be much moreapplicable and I will report on my results."
5,A Must Have Book!!,"I just finished reading your book and I loved it! It provides an excellent, easy to create framework that musicians can use to organize an overall vision for their careers and also includes the day-to-day tasks they will need to complete in order to make that vision a reality. It is well-organized, interesting, logical, and user-friendly. It is a must read for anyone interested in learning how to sell more CDs and enjoy themselves while doing it! Thank you!!!"
1,Reading this book proved profitless,"I regret spending my hard-earned money on this profitless book. But it might be a good starting point for younger readers aged 12-14- after all, you can't make $100,000 a year delivering newspapers! Mr. Hooper: does 'bio' really mean 'biography'? You saved me a trip to my dictionary! (and managed to pad your book with yet another banal sentence)"
4,Definitely Helpful,"I am a touring musician and making a living doing what i love is my dream. This book will do that for me. I have refused deals with prospective managers and labels because they aren't in it for anything but to take all they can from me. With this book, I can make my dreams come true and live for my music and let my music let me live."
4,Good primer,This is a good book. I read it and recommend it for anyone in a band or anyone without an in depth knowledge of the music business. Many of the points it made I found refreshing and inspiring.
2,"Not bad, but not great...","I excitedly purchased this book a few weeks back (printed off the PDF version on musicbizbooks.com). Many sections were pretty informative and I liked the blurbs from established mp3 artists...interesting.However, as another reader previously mentioned, there were several grammatical and spelling errors in the book, and some sections had very little information... information that I'm sure I could find elsewhere online for FREE.Let me tell you, the section about getting ready to tour/go on the road was my favorite (of course I'm being sarcastic)... it's obvious that this book is geared toward MALES in the music industry, as it flatly tells the reader not to jump into bed with fan(s) because ""she's probably fertile as hell""! I was very offended. There ARE musicians like me out there that are married and who do not need advice on promiscuity!Not bad, but I've read better and more informative music business books for LESS MONEY!"
5,Great infomation well presented,"Finally, a book that does what it promises, I enjoyed the information and ther real world, what to do, what not to do, and what works best attitude of the book. Opens my eyes to ways to bring in income with out ""selling out""."
4,The how-to book of how-to books,The information and advice is real and suggests how to accomplish what has worked. You can tell the information has evolved from trial and error efforts because it's thorough and logical. As a musician and Web designer I must say it covers all aspects of self-promotion. And I really liked the quotes of the music professionals.
4,"How I Make $100,000/year in the Music Business","I have been a successful touring musicical artist for the last three years now and ""$100.000 a year"" is a right on, easy read step by step map to booking your own tours and making a living doing it. Thanks"
4,Real World Advice To Maximize You Efforts,"I have learned by trial and error for over twenty years as a part-time for-profit solo, duo and band leader. This book illustrates much of what I have discovered, and given new insight into negotiation techniques which I have put into practice. I would like to see a range of pay rates and networking contacts for college performances and seasonal festivals. The book will provide many times over the price in increased earnings from playing the music that you love."
1,Over Priced and Under Done,"This book is bogus. It should be called ""How to Get Small Time Gigs for the Complete Idiot"". But if it were from the Idiot's series, it would be better written. Another soar point for me was that it was written by two guys from Nashville. I've been in music for fifteen years and even lived in Nashville for a few of those years. What I learned is that the ""music business"" mainly exists (on a corporate level) in LA and NYC, while Nashville is where the *country* music business exists in its own little bubble. The authors of this book fully embrace the old Nashville attitude of ""sure! I'll take that gig in the Burger King parking lot if it pays $50! Golly gee!"". If you are looking to make a *mediocre* living playing in clubs and at weddings, AND you have NO natural sense of business: A) Keep your day job, and B)Buy this book, but make sure you read it within 30 days so you can return it if you hate it as much as I do."
3,Need more specifics,"Basically, a good overview of tips and quotes about making it as an Indie artist but I would love to have a more detailed and specific explanation of many of the topics. Especially, with regards to bookings."
2,This Book is too Simple and broad,"I am a music professional and have worked in the industry my entire life. Thought I would pick this book up for a fun read and to also see how much useful information was in it. If you have very little background and are just starting out...this is an alright book. If you have a lot of common sense, and some basic marketing skills this book will not be of too much help. I think your money might be better spent on a music lesson than instead of this book."
2,For Beginners Only,This book is good if you have little or no experience in the music business or club scene. If you are an intermediate to experienced musician I think you'll find this book pretty light on content or strategies. Especially for the rather high price for a very short read.
2,My copy was defective!,"The information provided was pretty basic. Not much thought or effort went into typsetting. Some quotes by industry insiders were typset in all caps. Distracting and hard to read. Lots of typos.More importantly, the pagination on my copy was completely messed up - the last paragraphs from one page were repeated on the next, then the text was missing chunks from that page to the facing page. Very annoying.The text was not good enough to overshadow these mechanical errors. (...)"
3,Outstanding photography,"Excellent photography on the back cover makes this book as relevant for boys as well as girls. Addresses a dominant issue in our society today. (In case you haven't guessed, I am the photographer)."
4,Works as promised,"The product works as promised. The mechanics are a little stiff putting the mini-cassette in the casing, but otherwise it plays our old movies just fine."
5,I'ld Definitely Buy From This Seller,Amazon did not give a good description of this item. I purchased it and it would not work for me once I received it. The seller sent a postage paid form for my package and refunded my entire purchase including shipping. Customer service is number 1 for these guys! Kudo's to them!
2,NOT for 8mm :-(,"I've been searching high & low for an adapter that can play 8mm tapes... I purchased this off of the review of another person who said it does play 8mm, and when I got it [today], the package clearly states that it DOES NOT play 8mm tapes [sighs, back to my search]I wish that the seller would CLEARLY mark on the description that this adapter doesn't play 8mm [so disappointing]As a regular adapter for regular tapes, I'll give it 5 stars. B/c I purchased a poorly described item, I give it 2/5 stars.Now I'm in the process of returning it"
3,The jury is still out,"The company I got this from was great and I got it within a couple days of ordering. Unfortunately from there it didn't get any better. The instructions for use are woefully inadequate and I had to do a lot of messing around before I figured out what they were trying to tell me. After I got that figured out and tried it out with a VHS-C tape I found that it didn't work with the one I have. I hope it will work with others, but I haven't had that opportunity yet. At this point I would not recommend it."
1,Does Not Work At All,"The tape does not fit in it - and, if it does, it is too difficult to get the tape to fit."
1,Doesn't fit right,I lost the original with my camcorder and thought this would work. It has 2 pins sticking out that won't allow the tape to fit inside.
1,This is a pain,I bought the wrong thing. It didn't fit my video tape cassette. Your service was satisfactory. don't bother me with this type of nonsence again. don
3,Bob's Opinion,Received very promptly. The item was very inexpensive. I prefer the motorized adapter over the non motorized.
2,Cheap,I had a lot of difficulty in getting the VHS tape to fit into the cassette holder. The unit felt cheap (and I guess the old adage that you get what you pay for is true).
4,vhs-c converter,excellant price and rapid delivery in perfect condition. this model nice that no batteries needed - no complaints
1,Not a happy camper,"Although the Philips PH61300 Vhs-c Adapter seemed to be a capable replacement for our original Vhs-c adapter the actual results proved otherwise. After a couple of times loading the adapter into our Vhs system, the adapter became lodged/wedged in the system and will not eject. I will probably damage the Vhs system trying to remove the Adapter while also destroying the tape in the process. Not quite what I had envisioned."
2,Worked okay a few times.,"Worked okay a few times. it's a bit Flimsy, and buggered up my tapes! Yes, new tapes, and a fine quality player... Take you stuff to a professional to have it converted, and get a new digital camera!"
1,junk..junk...junk,"Purchased this to copy VHS_C Cassettes, tried and tried to get it to work with ourrecorder. Very, very flimsy, and the internal gears do not work. JUNK !! Back to square 1 !!"
3,PROBLEM SOLVED,"HI GUYSfor those of you in my shoes, and some of your comments show that we are in the same boatTHERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A HI 8 VHS ADAPTERread on here[...]Although I hate the outcome, i love the monkey off my back as I have been searching all over for one tooI thought it was odd that i could not fine ONE that matched what we have been looking forits because it doesnt existread that entire article and the end to give you other options for conversiontake carePS 3 of 5 stars to stay neutral as it is a vhs-c converter, not a hi 8 and they should clearly mark that, but i dont think they know the difference too"
1,TERRIBLE,"This adapter ""ate"" 2 very important tapes of my kid growing up...they are ruined. How do I get my money back? Can I rate this with minus stars?"
4,Only If,"I bought this Mower for my 3yr old's Birthday, I Love it he loves it! it is great except the day of his birthday we give it to him and the reverse does not work! yes it is minor but, it is new and you expect every function to work properly, You can not return to a store, so I figure it is only reverse, yes i would like for it to work but who want's to go through the hassel of finding a big enough box to have it shipped back! how do you explain that to a 3 yr old!BUT over all very cute toy! Lot's of room my son is 40in. Tall and 38lbs and has PLENTY of Room!"
3,Tractor,This is great except right after we received it and used it a few times the reverse did not work. I read this in a review before I bought it and thought maybe just that person had a problem. Then it happened to us. Would not recommend this.
5,"Ammo for the ""Shut up Limbaugh Organization""","If you ever needed a snappy comeback for the rantings if Rush Limbaugh this book is all you need. We know that politicians are people too but it is nice to see that they are as stupid as us nonelected members of the polity. If you are like me and want to blast El Rushbo, buy this book and email him a stupid Republican quote a day and see how he likes a taste of his own medicine!"
2,Ho hum,"Save your money. I usually love quote books and this one has a few good things, but it's really more the sort of thing you want to read in the store, not take home. Ho hum."
5,My Overwhelming Task,I am fairly new to the FrameMaker world and was involuntarily charged with the task of putting together a template. Needless to say I was overwhelmed. This book was good timing. It gave me the information I needed to get through some of the more difficult tasks like figuring out what all that header and variable stuff is about. I'm still no expert but I was able to get the stuff in the template working just fine from the teaching in this book.
1,Drivel,"This is not an advanced book, nor is the indexing comprehensive. I would expect that a ""power user"" would know how to index better. If you attempt to work with multiple dictionaries in FM and then find anything on it within the index - no can do. Writing style is extremely elementary and insulting to a power user (aka other writers). If you can read to the third grade level, you can read this. Much of the information is ""fluff,"" and is not necessary to the teaching. You could cut out 2/3rds and have a useful guide.Printing problems (standard in Framemaker) are not even discussed. This book should be titled: FrameMaker 6: BARELY the Basics."
2,Skimp on details,"After following numerous examples in this book, I end up getting a different result as was shown. I believe Framemaker is operating system specific, therefore something that works in the examples using Mac, doesn't work in Unix. The author should of noted this in each of the examples."
1,Lame,"This is a lame movie. Don't waste your time, you will be sorry and wish you could have that time back to do something worth while."
1,Don't waste you time,"HiThis book was a waste of time. I had seen articles from one ofthe authors in PC mags and thought his advice was good.This book was very disapointing.I got rid of it. It was not worth donating to a thrift store,I did not want to waste some one else's time.I put in the paper recycling...."
1,Very Limited,"Let me save everyone here time and money. Pass on this book. Almost every solution involves checking the cords to see if they are properly connected, and very little beyond that. I flipped through the chapter on display settings and laughed at how much fluff is in this book. This book is even useless for beginners, if you want a solid book about how to troubleshoot a PC pick up a Mike Myers book (Any one of them). If you know to check a loose cord first then you don't need this book, but if you don't know how to check for a loose cord then you should write a note a post it by your PC and Keyboard, more helpful tool than this book..."
5,Product of the 80's but Love L&S,"I wasn't around when this show came out and not really sure why I started watching it now. However, its a great show and its classic tv. I enjoy my dvd. If your a person such as myself who is a fan of old shows I would get this for your collection."
3,Laverne and Shirley,"I really enjoy the comedy from these to true comedians. It's great to be able to see the seasons by the year. I would like some special features added to the dvd's, such as an interview etc."
2,Bare bones Basics...,"This book is the very bare bones basics of common lock type overviews and theories on how to open them. After purchasing it I found other websites out there that had published this book on the net. Book can be read in an hour or so, save your money or search it on the web."
2,Review for Amazon,You'd only know what the author was talking about if you've done the work before or already know locksmith terminology.
4,Great book to get started in locksmithing.,"This book gave very good detail of how to pick a lock and start into the world of locksmithing. Whether it be for personal use or to start your own business, this book shows you how. I thought it was wonderful."
2,Secrets of Lock Picking,"Do not waste your money on this book. Instructions are not clear and confusing as heck and incomplete. The book itself is cheap-looking, the drawings and illustrations are trashy."
3,Uneven Mix of Haunting and not so haunting Stories,"Peter Haining has included some very good stories in ""The Mammoth Book of Haunted House Stories"" that have been collected elsewhere, e.g. ""Lost Hearts"" by M.R. James and ""The Whistling Room"" by William Hope Hodgson. He also included stories that have never (to my knowledge) been included in an anthology--and for a good reason. They usually weren't worth reading (at least, if you're looking for a good scare). There were also too many humorous ghost stories for my taste -- authors always seem to come off as over-arch and coy when they strain for levity in a ghost story.I'd recommend ""Haunted Houses - The Greatest Stories"" which was edited by Martin H. Greenburg over this collection of Peter Haining's. Haining seemed to be straining for 'mammoth' rather than for 'haunted'."
3,"Looking to get your spine chilled -- not here you're not,",Some nice atmospheric tales in this mix and there isn't really a duffer in them that is outrageously bad.However I did go in expecting a fair dosage of hairs rising on the back of my neck and got nothing like that from these tales.
3,Not so scary...,"This book has alot of stories, some are good, some are not so good. These stories go as far back as the 1800's. They are well written but they aren't going to appeal to the folks who are looking for a good scare."
1,Very dry collection of ghost stories,"This book is a collection of ghost stories. It is part of the popular ""Mammoth Book"" series. The stories are dry and anything but scary. I didn't care for the book at all, and if you are looking for scary, or even interesting, ghost stories don't buy this book."
2,Never judge a book by its cover....,"There's the old addage, ""never judge a book by its cover"" (this cover is pretty cool) and I should have listened to it. Mammoth? Yes, clocking in at over 500 pages. Scary? Err, not really. Barring the one story of a Russian father and son repating the past to the horror of a neighboring tenant, this book was downright boring and allot of times hard to follow. Comprised of many short stories I thought this would be a good one to keep near the bed for when I wanted a quick read, what I didn't realize was how outdated the stories were and how confusing some of the dialect would be. My advice, skip this one."
3,Play and Nursing,"(I have an older version of this Boppy, it just has different designs.) My son did like to play under it and once he could reach the toys, he could pull on them all he wanted and nothing ever broke. One thing I didn't care for - when the toys were overhead, they seemed to tilt forward so instead of being over his head they were down towards his belly. However, I needed this to nurse with so the toy aspect fell by the wayside. I loved to use it nursing, it was great at night when you are half asleep. Now I am using it for when I let him play sitting up because it cushions his occasional fall. If you just need it for nursing, I would buy a regular Boppy and get something else for your little one to play with."
3,Better get two items instead of one/...,"I really like the boppy pillow product, I found it very useful for both my children. I received this for a shower gift - the play area is nice I really like this product EXCEPT for the fact that come feeding time I am pulling off all the connections to feed my baby, then putting them back on whenever we use it for play again! So in retrospect I would have simply liked the floor play area seperate from the feeding pillow (or if I had another boppy I would have used it but thats just more money!)"
4,Great travel toy,"Our boppy entertainer is on it's second child now. I love the fact that the bars can come off and it can be used like a traditional boppy plus for only $10 more than the origional boppy, it also comes with the entertainer feature.I did purchase an extra cover to use on it with the first child but found out that I did not need to. It is durable enough alone.The bars do tend to tilt one direction or the other but that seems pretty minor, things that helped is making a Y shape out of the O rings that you attach the toys to and also adding an extra O ring to the connector between the bars.We use this at home and away. If you do much traveling with a baby, this is one thing you should consider invesing in, expecially if you plan to breastfeed. The boppy will save a breastfeeding mothers back!"
1,dont buy this bolt,This bolt sucks. It did not fit my marker and after looking at it i highly doubt it would help accuracy or performance.
5,Rich in history,"The Flying Tigers, or formally ""American Volunteer Group,"" did more than just helping China defend itself against an aggressive Japan, but gathered intelligence for the U.S. military and helped pave the way for U.S. victory in the Orient. This video gives a very vivid account using actual footages as well as interviews. It's well edited and inspiring. A must-have for history buffs and others."
5,Better than expected.,"Very happy with this unit. The gps functions are super if you remember to put up the antenna (duh). The voice directions are clear and helpful. The points of interest will help find various things but before driving to them, things like restaurants should be called on phone as some may be out of business, which is not Garmins fault. The speakerphone functions works better with my bluetooth phone than my Jabra bluetooth and is great when driving. It even downloands my phonebook to the gps via the bluetooth automatically. Touchscreen works well. No complaints at all."
3,does the job most of the time.,I live in NYC (manhattan) where there are tons of skyskrapers of course and it has alot of problems getting a satellite signal usually.. Takes over 15 minutes to get a conection IF it can even get one.At most I will ever have is 2 bars..Once I travel to outside of the manhattan like New Jersey or to an outer borough it works fine for the most part. Manhattan itself is really easy and one doesnt really need a GPS as its a grid.I would say it has alot of problem in high building areas..They really need to make it more sensitive the antenna
5,Garmin did it right!,The Garmin Nuvi is the best GPS/MP3/Audible/Bluetooth combination out there. The implementation is intuitive and easy. The playback of audibles or mp3's is automatically paused when directions for the GPS are required or an incoming call is being routed through the Bluetooth. Perfect!
4,Nuvi 360,"I have used the product quite a few times since purchasing. It works fine and very user friendly. The screen can be hard to see in direct sunlight, but you can adjust it so that the image is viewable.Very happy with it."
3,Confused with this product.,"Sometimes it find the signal very fast!BUT something it will never find it even i was walking.Once it finds the signal, it works perfectly, some local restaurant, business, very very good product."
4,Garmin 360 is HELPFUL!!,"Good directions, if you miss a turn it recalculates for you & walks you through ""the fix"". Positioning on dash is important in bright sunlight, be careful when sticking the mount if not in bright light. N Timm"
5,Garmin nuvi 360,Excellent. I also own GPS built into car and nuvi 680. nuvi 360 is a smaller version of nuvi 680. Pronunciation of woman speaker could be improved. Doesn't re-calculate as fast as units built into our cars.
5,Nuvi 360..FANTASTIC,"Purchased the Nuvi 360 last month..GREAT....bluetooth clear, directions right on, voice commands and directions are clear and accurate.List of favorites is fantastic....Stole for 329$.WOW!!!!!"
4,Garmin nüvi 360,"Before I settled on the Garmin. I used a GPS in a rental car. I've used both the Nuvi and Street Pilot. I looked at TomTom and Magellan and in my opinion the Nuvi is much easier and user friendly than the others. While TomTom has the where am I feature, I wish Garmin had, I decided Garmin was the unit I would go with. While I don't care for the suction cup mount that comes with the unit, the unit itself is easy to use. For the price if you can find it on sale, it is a best buy. For the price, I would have hoped to get the Garmin carrying bag with it and I would like to see the sandbag dash mount come with it as a choice/option upon purchase instead of an addition expense, but the Nuvi 360 I purchased meets my expectations."
5,Sooo much better than paper maps,"I just got back from 10 days in Virginia and the Garmin was invaluable. Finding your way around in a totally strange place is usually rather difficult, but with this GPS it was a breeze. Easy to understand directions with plenty of time to change lanes for freeways exits. The bluetooth really helped, too. Love the hands free talking. I can't say enough good things about the Garmin Nuvi 360. I'm buying another one for my daughter."
5,Garmin Nuvi 360 GPS Navigator,"This was so much more than we even thought. We can find a place to eat, a place to sleep, different kinds of eating places, just get off the exit and it gives us step by step instructions to find where we are going. We have used it in places we knew where we were and took different routes to see how it would react and it re directed itself and us to a new route to get to where we wanted to go. Also places where we didn't know where we were going, it took us right to where we wanted to go. This has so much good information in it we can't elaborate in this short space. The best part, we could use it right out of the box since we are both technically challanged. The instruction book is very good too so people can understand exactly how to use it. We are looking forward to retiring in a couple of years and going West with this. It will really get a try out then. We try to get lost and can't with it.It is a lot of fun."
4,Garmin 360 Nuvi,"3rd week of use - travelling around MidWest and SouthCentral U.S.. A few map glitches (on way to Chicago from Detroit - a detour through Ann Arbor? (unit does not have travel/construction alerts so this was just a glitch). If you travel through different time zones, be careful - unit does not auto-adjust when you cross over, so your arrival time is stated in the time zone that you left. Per Garmin, the technology patent for changing the time zone over is owned by cell phone companies? And I thought one couldn't patent the obvious! Overall good little unit - like how compact it is. Haven't used bluetooth or Mp3 features....can't imagine using MP3 ever since audio would be less than stellar (don't have FM transmitter)."
3,"slow response, good when it works","slow response time and very slow to catch sattellites, sometimes very furstrating. when it does, it works great."
4,"Like it, still getting the hang of it","This is our first GPS and so far we really like it. My husband and I did our homework and this model (although discontinued) had the best ratings with Consumer Reports for this price range. We plan to take it on our first road trip next weekend then I think we'll have a good handle on it but so far it's been great. Only problem we had was loading the new map that came with it, I still don't think my husband has gotten it and he knows computers well. There's an issue with that, but still the older map that's preloaded is great. The bluetooth that connects to your cell phone is really cool too. You can search on the GPS for a location , once it's found you can call the place your going to and speak to them thru the speaker phone on the GPS. Handy and simple. I would definetly suggest this to a friend."
2,Old Maps,"Unit arrived as new??? but the maps were four updates old and Garmin called the unit as refurbished because the maps had been accessed on the unit in 2008? I am sending the unit back because I purchased thinking it was new and it was possibly a refurb. Amazon states in their listings that they sell so many GPS that the maps should not be old, but four updates old? I don't know what goes here but something is strange.This is an excellent GPS and if new well worth the money, but not worth it if refurbished."
3,OK for the money,Pros - Sleek and fits in the pocket.Cons - Takes a while to acquire the satellite if you are in a big city like Chicago. It could be the tall buildings. But sometimes it literally takes 10 mins.The socket to plug in the input could have designed better so as to keep the unit flat on the passenger seat.Volume is low.Sometimes announcements come too close to the turnIt takes a long time for it to decide on a detour. I would expect it to decide on an alternate route faster when I deviate from the original path.
1,terrible,for me this unit was terrible. Once I turned it on I couldn't turn it off. It always stayed on. It's destination was always a minimum of 300 ft. off. I would drive up to the door of any destination and it would be 300 feet off. The bluetooth would not sync to my blackberry. For me it was terrible. I would not recommend this.
4,Happy go lucky,"We have only used this product three times. At first, I thought I wouldn't like the small size but it has turned out to be such a great advantage. I can take it out of the car and slip it into a pocket or purse if need be.This navigator talks and reroutes if you miss a turn. It lets you know about a turn before it is necessary, both on screen and by audio!Easy to operate.I researched other gps's and it is a great price for a product that has many other options;like blue tooth. I also save on gas and time. I have had the product for a month and I love it, so far."
4,good GPS,"So far it fits the requirments I needed. The best thing is it has shopping menu which contains all kinds of stores address. Basically as long as you know the name of the store, you can go there. Also it is the same for gas station. But I have to say it's not updated so well. Once I want to find the nearest shell station because I'm almost ran out of oil. But the addresses is wrong, TWICE. I'm very close to call someone towing my car that day. So if you want to go to some gas station, go online to confirm first.Other things are really good. Especially when you know the accurate address of the position you want to go. There are so many similar addresses with slight differences aroung. Like south, north, Dr, Blvd, or just different city. It's very confusing when you just look though the paper map. The only thing you need to be careful is that don't enter the wrong name.You definitely need one."
1,Beware buying from seller Douglas Carnahan,"I ordered a Garmin Nuvi 360 GPS unit as a Christmas gift from Douglas Carnahan, a seller of Garmin units who has an Amazon ""store"". Not only did he not ship the product as promised, he also did not answer 2 emails of mine and one from Amazon.Not being able to fill an order is understandable. That happens. Not replying to a customer's emails or to Amazon's is not understandable - or acceptable - for a seller desiring to stay in business.I wanted to warn others looking for GPS units."
1,Broken pieces,Very excited for this product when I went to use it with the car adaptor I realized they had given me a broken adaptor that can not be used.So now I must go through the process of getting this issue resolved while questioning whether this product was really ever new?
5,Amazing little gadget!!!,"The Nuvi 360 is incredible. How they can pack such technology into such a small package boggles my mind! It's extremely easy to use, right out of the box. Just charge it, and you're on your way!! Easily linked up to my cell phone via bluetooth and is a great feature! Lot's of points of interest, and if what you're looking for is not in it's database, just search for it and it should find it! Menu's are very easy to navigate. You almost don't need to read the manual, that's how easy and intuitive it is! If you're looking for a great little GPS, this is it!!!!"
5,Excellent product,"I picked up two of these units for my twin daughters. Both consider themselves to be technically and geograpically challenged. Both were facile with the units within an hour. Apart from being easy to master, the volume, picture clarity and cueing algorithm made the units very useful even when driving conditions required the full attention of the driver. They and I could not be more pleased."
3,Bad luck to get a defeated one,"With the so many good reviews and so high rate, I bought one during thanksgiving. It first lost signal every few minutes and need to reset the unit. After I upgraded the software, and it works fine just 30% of time. Occasionally, it went crazy and while I drove on a highway, it showed I drove on a nearby side road and consistantly ask me to drive on highlighted route. I reture it to Costco and thanks to their return policy, I didn't lose any thing. Just suspicious, if Garmin ship their defeated product to Costco, because they have the lowest price.While it works fine, it is pretty nice device and should be very useful. That is why I give it a 3 star."
2,"one of the best Garmin products, BUT","i gave the Garmin Nuvi 360 2 stars to capture your attention, i think this gadget deserves above 5 stars. its great and reliable and maps are rich with info. only 2 problems. if you have big hands and fingers then don't buy this item cuz the screen is small and you will end up zooming in and out just to make sure you save locations right. The other thing is, most devices when specifying ""support SD"" thy sometimes support MMC cards too, but not the garmin.other than that GOOO FOR IT! its fantastic"
2,Not so great this time,"I usually get pretty good products from amazon. But this time I am in bad luck. There is obviously something wrong of this product - I can't turn it on after taking it for a test drive after one hour. I thought it was because the battery was low. As I was unwrapping the cable in the car to charge the battery, something fell off. I looked closer, the tip of the cable was broken! I was on a small street of SF, and I had no sense of direction. Boy, it took me long time to figure out how to get out of there without GPS as I could not turn on the thing. I was not happy about that. It was good that amazon refunded the money to me, but I still have to pay a shipping fee of $18.00 which is not refunded.Lesson learned: always test your product thoroughly within 30 days of purchase."
4,Works with Sony Ericsson Z525a,I was a little unsure as the Garmin site did not state compatibility with this phone (they had the earlier Z520 model listed). Checked it out and it works fine.I am very satisfied with this cool piece of technology - found the sound to be OK as well. Rating 4 stars (instead of 5) because I saw one reboot when fiddling with the power on the device and some of the menus. That and I feel the user interface could be a little more intuitive - my wife is unfamiliar with GPS navigators and she took some time to work thru the menus.
3,Already obsolete,"First came the 350. By the time I got that one, the 360 came out. Now, it's the 660 which has a bigger screen and the traffic feature is integrated into a 12VDC auto adaptor. Much less in the way of wires and goofy antennas needed for the traffic features on the 360. With some trepidation, I sprung for the 660 and love it EXCEPT for living in fear that the 760 or 860 or 960 is around the corner waiting to make all the above obsolete. Go for it but be prepared to live with it or spend again for the ""latest""."
2,Dissapointed in Software,"We were very happy when we received this product and were happy that we made a good investment, until we start using it .....Unfortunately, when we started using the GPS and start getting lost in places which were built 2 years ago, we found out the software was quite old and was sold in a new package. There has been a lot of construction in North Florida lately and this GPS got us lost in 50% of the places we went to. Garmin should be very careful in promoting the new design with a old software. We had bought GPS primarily for traveling purposes and rest of the features were added benefits which made us choose this product among many others, like Tom Tom, NavMan, etc. etc.We had to return the unit as it was useless for us. Amazon was very professional and took the return in a timely fashion.Garmin makes great products but make sure that the software has a updated version before you buy one next time.PM"
3,Garmin nuvi 360 Bluetooth GPS Navigator,Gives great directions verbally as well as graphically. I have not been able to hook up my cell phone to use the bluetooth yet. I do not think my phone is compatable with the nuvi. There is no way of knowing if it is compatable until you purchase the unit. If I knew this upfront I would have gone for a gps without the bluetooth and paid less.
4,Works pretty well so far,"I bought this Nuvi 360 a month and a half ago. As of now used few functionalities to find my way. It did find and took me to the places I wanted. Did not find any thing much to complaint.Liked: Small and compact. Easy to use. Till now it has served its purpose.Don't like: It takes a long time to get signal. E.g. From my home I go inside the underground parking. Sit in my car and select my destination. I know its hard for it go get signal in underground Parking. Then it takes forever to get the signal even when I am outside. So I have to turn it off and then turn back on. Once ON it gets the signal pretty fast.Second thing is its hard to get to main menu sometimes when you are fewApart from the above issues, overall I like this small little gadget. Would recommend if you have tight budget but still looking for a good GPS."
3,garmin Nuvi360 model,"For the price the product is fine. this is the first gps so there is no comparision to other models and manufacturers. Occassionally it points in the wrong direction, going West instead of East and if you don't follow their route it tries to loop you back. But friends tell me all GPSs work this way and it will get you to your destination. perhaps, it is my use but I cannot get it to work if I only enter cross streets (two interesections) rather than a specific numbered address, nor does it work for landmarks, eg, City Hall or named shopping center/mall. But for an entry gps this is satisfactory for travelling."
5,Love this thing,"Awsome product. It took about 30 mins to really figure this thing out but once I did it really works great. I love that you can bypass construction and it recalculates your route automatically. The bluetooth is awesome for hands free mobile. The website is great for all of your questions like ""how do you get the thing to say the street names instead of turn left in 100 ft"". Just change the voice and it says the street names. The thing fits right in my front pocket when I'm not in the car. I haven't quite figured out how to navigate on foot that well. I tried it once and it was a little difficult to follow. Overall I am completely satisfied."
3,Maps Not Complete,"After much research I purchased teh Garmin 360, but I am sad to say that I am not as pleased as I had hoped. Even after the free update, the maps do not pick up many streets that have been existing for many years. On a recent trip from Indianpolis to Cincinnati, the unit sent me in the entirely wrong direction away from Cincinnati. Thank goodness I knew where I was going and made a correction.The spoken name of the street works very well."
5,The dumbing of drivers,This makes people even more stupid when driving.That felt good to write.I bought this for my wife as she knows nothing of the LA streets. It gets her to where she's going and home again so it's doing it's job. Battery life is decent as well.I just have a personal vendetta for GPS devices. I come from the Thomas guide school of knocks.
4,Very Good GPS,"I'm very happy with this GPS because of It's simplicity of use and response is perfect. It is not the best GPS but for common people who sometimes travel is great! The Bluetooth with my nokia's 6311 and 5800 worked perfect. Speed of connection with satellite here in my country 7 out of 10.I think It have two cons:1. The external antenna makes it uncomfortable to manage, and seems to be very sensible.2. Lack of the function to save the route."
2,Drop even One time...Its gone for good!,"I bought this item for christmas last year in 2008. I purchased it for 169.00 Yes I said 169.00....what is with the new Hefty price for the same model???I used it occasionally on the dashboard mount. As i was placing it there last week, it fell onto a PADDED car floor. (I have thick all weather proof Mats).Mind you it was not thrown, and only fell about 2 feet. After picking it up I see that the LCD screen is no longer functioning. There are zig zag lines on the LCD screen.I do not beleive that a product of this nature which is built to be used in the car, should become useless after this.The warranty does not cover it.I will never buy from Garmin again. I can not believe how fragile this was."
2,Great item except bluetooth doesn't function well.,If I could do it over I would buy Nuvi350 w/o blue tooth option. This would save ~$100. It's not worth paying extra when this feature is not great quality. There's echo and noise in calls.
4,Would be lost without it.,I bought this product when I moved to a new city and it has definitely kept me from getting lost several times. Would reccomend to anyone looking for a GPS.
4,Nuvi 360,"Sweet gps works great...but, speaker not quite loud enough and bluetooth pretty much useless without external speaker. But as i bought this to be a gps not a phone, is it fine for my needs. Price was great and nowhere did i see refurb or reman, but packaging was a bit suspect.tsd"
5,98.5% perfect....amazing device,"This device is simply great. Incredible value for a GPS + Bluetooth device - paying $2000 for GPS and $250 for BT installed in car is lunacy in my book because this device is better and you can walk/bike with it as well. Paired easily with wife's LG and my SE. (the SE also uploaded the address book, LG did not). only 98.5% perfect because no device is, but this is the closest I have ever seen anything come to perfection... I can ramble on and on but the bottom line is - get this.Also - consider where you want to install this - we have it in the left bottom corner of windshield (where the registration sticker is - fits just right - the wide screen would have forced a higher mount..."
5,Buy it!!! Don't wait!!,"This is my first GPS purchase, a gift for someone else, but I've used it myself many times. It FAR exceeded my expectations on many levels--it is very easy to use, portable, its maps are up to date, and it has more features than most people have use for. There are no clumsy antennas to install, the windshield mount included works very well, and it also has three different power adapters (one for use in the car, another to plug into a wall outlet and another to plug into a USB port of a pc). I haven't used the bluetooth connection, the audiobook function, or the currency converter, but I'm sure they are all as easy to use as its normal features. And for those who've read in other reviews that its one drawback is that it doesn't come with a printed user manual, don't worry--it's easy enough to use without one, though it does have a cd rom version included.In short, one of the best electronic purchases I've ever made, no joke."
4,Good deal,"I consider this as a good deal since the cost of the same device in our country is much higher, in addition it is very user friendly and easy to use."
4,Great Product - Used it for over an year,"I have it for over an year now and its an absolutly wonderful product. Super sleek and easy to take away from one car to another. excellent reception, can even catch signal in Manhatten. On the down side, though finding location from address is most accurate, the POI database not. Although i do not use POI much, but whenever i tried to use it never took me to the right place."
4,Refurbished model a great deal,"Purchased refurbished from DigitechDeals--I was very impressed with the quality of the product. Arrived quickly. Looks new. Came with last year's maps but was able to download new 2009 maps for free automatically. My only complaint is that I bought this particular model for the text-to-speech capability, and there is only one voice option for ""American English."" Other than that, I am very pleased. It seems to direct me in logical ways--no unnecessary U-turns, etc."
4,Nuvi 360 GPS,"Found the other reviews helpful in purchase. Item as advertised. I thought it worked very well right out of the box. No problem with it staying on the windshield. Plugs right in to the 12 volt. Clear screen, easy to work the features. Blue tooth speaker almost adequate which other's warned as well. Tells you streets coming up. Touch screen makes things easier, such as entering street addresses etc. I feel like it was a good purchase. Amazon price was excellent."
4,Address Finding & User Interface Rocks :-) POI is POS!!!!!,"Very easy to use, fast and accurate! The address database seems up-to-date. It found our house & we are in a very new sub division (not still accessible from google maps!)The point of interest listing however needs to be updated badly! We could not find 3 out of the 4 businesses that we looked up by category (they had closed down!) and found none of the ones that we looked up by name & know exist!"
1,no good unit/ has 2006 maps sold as 2008 maps,"we went on a trip from dayton, ohio to apex, nc this is my 9th trip to apex i used garmin older gps in my other trips, this trip i took the new unit i was surprised it took me on the state route.we went to nc to jacksonville florida than to atlanta GA, I was very not happy with the unit, always wants me to take to the state route, the worst part its a old unit of 2006 map sold in 2008, this piss me off."
2,Serious tunnel bug,"The Nüvi 360 has a serious system error: after passing a tunnel, the Nüvi 360 cannot find any satellite at all. Even after waiting for more than 30 minutes! The system has to be reset by switching it off and on again. On my way from Holland to Italy via Switzerland, I had to switch off and on the system more than 10 times. Very annoying, I am disappointed! If I had known this, I would not have bought this expensive GPS. I informed Garmin weeks ago about this, but I did not receive any response at all.Further, I would not recommend it for bikes: small roads are often interrupted and in this way not chosen by the system."
2,GPS Yes - Hands Free Cell NO!,"Well, its only day one and of the two places I asked it to take me it got both wrong. Well, OK I'll let it slide this time maybe old data maybe bad hair day. Overall the GPS function does what it says it does.The bluetooth and my iPhone are another story. It was almost comical. I bought the thing to save my life on the road so I can do hands free cell calls, and the exact opposite happened. I'm driving down the road and things are blinking and beeping and disconnecting and not pairing and calls dropping and more beeping and then swerve a little then brake stop in the midst of beeping and chirping. It may work for 1/2 a phone call, but then just assume the worst and you won't be disappointed. Basically there is no bluetooth hands free anything. Even if you duct tape them together,they can't find each other or stay in contact for longer than 2 minutes.SOOOO given there really is no bluetooth, just buy a cheaper GPS only version and call it a day."
5,Still satisfied with Garmin,"This is the third Garmin from Amazin for the family. Even my wife, who is not technically inclined thinks they are great. They work grat once you get the systme running.CONS: They could improve their installation process. I could not get it to work with Vista so had to go to an XP machine after about 5 hours of frustration."
3,"One of the best, but irritating weaknesses","Garmin still makes a very poor in-car power adapter, the one in the 360 failed after only four months. I spliced in one from a Motorola (one piece as opposed to the Garmin multi-piece apprach) so no more problems. As numerous reviewers note the routing has bizarre habits of turing on and off major highways. That happens in the US, Germany, France, UK, Italy and Slovenia. Bad thinking, and sometimes a major hassle. In spite of that this is still a very good unit, but with saved routes eliminated, the routing problem recurs every trip. I have upgraded, although still to another Garmin. Will the 670 have the same problems? I hope not."
3,Nuvi 360,Product and services were Good. Speaker volume was too low to be heard while on GPS mode. Had to return it.
5,GPS NAVIGATION,My family and I have used this NUVI 360 a couple of times and love it. It has incredible detail and roads that are not even on local maps. It is very easy to use and battery life is about 4hrs with back light on. The only feature that took a bit to get used to is the flip up antenna the GPS does not work unless the antenna is up. Other than that a nother great product Garmin has.
5,Nice device for the money.,The Nuvi 360 has been very reliable and accurate. We even used it in Puerto Rico and the information provided was right on.
4,I get lost just so my Nuvi can take me back home!,Love the Nuvi .... love it! Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the system won't connect with my bluetooth enabled samsung phone.
4,Garmin Nuvi 360,I love this item. I travel a lot with my job and this is so helpful and easy to use. I can find my hotel from the airport with no problem and even provides me with places to eat. I recommended this item to a co-worker who travels also.
4,great gps,"The Garmin nuvi 360 is very accurate and easy to use. The only flaw I found was the ""voice"", pronunciation is not very good. It is hard to understand some of the street names. That is a small thing for a great gps with bluetooth at a very reasonable price."
5,gps!!,Tried out several but went w/ Garmin despite the smaller screen than the TomTom. Very helpful when traveling & looking for lodging or food in a new area! Very nice & easy to use right out of the box.
3,Very good lower end model,It is a nice little model. Very useful on road trips. A little dated now but still gets the job done. Better then spending 2k+ on in dash.
4,Garwin nuvi 360 GPS,"If you do travel from state to state this machine will not be okay. I have to make trips to multiple states and it does not keep up with the changes. It has taken me down dead end roads. Turned me down one way streets and recalculated enough times that I should have invested in a good atlas. I have watched it set and try to find a address for 15 minutes and turn it off and ask someone at a gas station for directions, turn it back on and it have the direction and be ready to go. I liked our other Garwin we had 1st we never had any problems."
4,Garmin Nuvi 360,"A recent long car trip proved the worth of my new GPS unit. It easily navigated us through and around major cities and back roads between them. I would say the maps and information in the Garmin are not as up to date as one would like. we found several roads and intersections that had been rebuilt and revised since the Garmin maps were created. Several restaurants were some years out of date and were closed or changed names. The unit worked perfectly, was pretty easy to use and understand and the out of date maps were seldom if ever a big problem. All in all, a good buy."
5,Great piece of technology!,"I have had limited experience with previous GPS systems. The BMW iDrive navigation system is relatively primitive compared to the Garmin Nuvi 360. Unlike the BMW iDrive system, the Nuvi 360 helps locate food, lodging and entertainment locations regionally (a great feature) The Bluetooth works flawlessly with my Motorola cell phone, but took awhile to download the phone book. Have yet to use the flash memory expansion slot, photo, audible.com features. Would recommend based on my recent 500 mile vacation. My only criticism: I wish the Nuvi can download my address book from my Mac."
4,Great catch!,"This GPS navigation system from Garmin is the best I have ever tried or used. it has alot of features that you'd never imagine something that small could have that much equiped. with the bluetooth connectivity where you can pickup calls and use the built in speakers just made it for me. over all, worth every penny."
5,gli,"Absolutely fantastic! I loved.It is very useful to me.shipping is wonderful too.Just the bluetooth didin't match my cell phone,so still work on it."
4,Garmin Nuvi GPS,"This satellite navigator is exactly what I wanted. It's anti reflective screen is excellent in the Florida sun. Also it is small enough, weighs very little and is slim enough to slip into my pocket to take into work. A good buy. The only thing is I wish I could have afforded to buy the larger screen one!"
4,"For the most part, it works great...","This product is for the most part just like all the other GPS's on the market. They work just fine for the most park but tend to have some quirks. For instance, sometimes there is a delay with the voice prompt of when to turn - but usually only a few seconds behind - and sometimes it gives screwball directions to a destination. But other then that I am very happy with the product and I doubt that I, or anyone else, could do better."
4,"Better than I Thought, Great Product!!","This thing is really something, I really didn't need it, I just wanted it! It doesn't always map out the shortest way, but either does Mapquest. I would have given it ""5 stars"", but the bluetooth sometimes forgets to pair with my phone"
4,Sure beats maps,"We have only used this product once. It worked fine, but it did make one mistake during directions. However, immediately after it renavigated us and put us on the right course again. I do recommend it."
3,Speaker not loud enough,"I returned this product a few days after purchase. If you drive a loud car like mine, the speaker is inadequate. In my Mazda Miata, top down at highway speed, the unit was totally inaudible. I also used it in my Corolla and even in that relatively quiet car the unit's volume was barely adequate, with the volume all the way up.Otherwise, in my few days using it, it seemed like a good unit. Controls were logical and navigation fine."
5,Garmin nuvi 360,"Excellent product!!! While it is not the latest model, it does everything I need it to do; tell me how to get from one place to another. The screen is extremely clear to see and the voice easily understood."
2,NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL,"Unit works ok , however if you use it seldom and need instructions when you do , look elsewhere. Garmin has no instructions manuals , none , you can download and print them on 8x10 paper which is not handy to keep in the car. You would think for the amount of money you spend they would give you a manual."
5,Garmin nüvi 360 GPS Navigator,We purchased this as a gift.The recipients were overjoyed with it and quickly learned how to use it and access a surprising world of real time information.It provided accurate and understandable instructions for all of the long and local trips that were queried.Garmin nüvi 360 3.5-Inch Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with Text-To-Speech
2,sound doesn't work,"The sound has stopped working 3 times and I keep having to send it back, what a hassel."
4,it was in great condition,"I really haven't use it for long, but it's great . the blue tooth is wonderful"
4,Very useful,"Even though the maps are obsolete (at least 3 years behind what is happening now) and sometimes you have to make a decision on the spot (roads do change in 3 years), it's an useful instrument (most of the streets are still the same). Especially if you are travelling alone or through areas that you don't know... it's a must have."
5,Works great out of the box!,This came recommended by a freind - and it measured up to my expectations. The Bluetooth is really cool. Love the ease of use of the touch screen. The windshield mount isn't perfected yet.
4,Good product,"This product is awesome. Worth the money, the product is very intuitive. I havent tried the bluetooth aspect of it because my car is bluetooth."
3,Maps can be deceiving on this unit,"This is my second Garmin, first Nuvi. The routes this Nuvi takes you can be deceiving. Yesterday, it wanted to take the back route from Sacramento to Modesto California. This is the second time this unit has taken a less direct route to a location for me. My daughter is happier with the Tom Tom."
3,"Good map, so-so navigation, bad loactions.","The map of this one is quite good enough, accurate. The navigation is not very sensitive, doesn't aware me in the right time, a little earlier or later. The locations are bad. I live in NJ, when I entered ""Sam's club"", after 5 min search to wait, got only 1 result in PA."
4,Perfect if it were bigger...,"This GPS has more than you would ever need in a GPS if only it were a widescreen. If you buy a GPS, buy one with a ""W"" next to the number and you're golden. Otherwise I would have given this 5 stars. How did we ever get by without GPS's??"
2,lacks some detail,"I bought this product because of the nice reviews it had. I am disappointed. My husband has a TomTom One(a much cheaper product) and his device has much more planning options- like navigate to recent destination, points of interest near current position, along route and near destination. It's also easier to put in a new address since it recognizes the street names much faster - it pulls a list only after you type 2 letters. On the display the TomTom (unlike Garmin) also shows how many more miles you have left to destination, current speed and time - these are nice features I don't want missing. Both Garmin and TomTom have estimated arrival time and distance to next turn. The only thing I like about the Garmin is the text to speech but that's pretty much it. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Good buy,"This product is good for the money spent on it. Lacks some features of the more expensive models, but gets the job done and fits in the budget."
4,almost perfect,"I just received my Nuvi 360. The unit is almost perfect. I was able to use it immediately. I love the fact that it recharges when plugged into a computer usb port, that's one less charger cable I need to carry with me. the charger also works with my Motorolz Razr phone, again one less thing to have to find or carry. All in all excellent, highly recommended."
4,good product for the price,"This is a good product for the price, when compared to others in the price range. However, don't buy it, if you plan to use it in the pedestrian mode, as it is no useful. In the pedestrian mode, the unit can't even tell where you are, which makes navigating difficult. it shows you to be a block or so off. Also because it has a flip up antenna that is needed to acquire the satellite signal, it is not best for walking. But in driving mode, its a fine unit. The option to maximize the use of freeways/toll ways vs. surface street has to be selected upfront in the configuration. also, text to speech feature only works if you choose the generic American English option, vs. others (it has 3 American English options)."
5,This product is great.,"This product has exceeded my expectations in every way. The cell phone Bluetooth connection works great. I did not buy any options,the fm Traffic, for it, so I can not give rating on that"
4,Garmin 360 .Great Value / Fair Price,Wanted the bluetooth capabilty with clarity for both incoming and outgoing..It's been great. Occasionally loose the phone bluetooth so I have to resync.Overall a great choice
2,Garmin 360,"My Garmin 350 works fine. However, my Garmin 360 volume is too low at it's highest setting and the bluetooth feature, the microphone, does not work well - people can not hear me."
4,I am very happy with this purchase.,In my opinion Garmin nuvi 360 is worth to purchase. It works real good as I expected.
3,Good GPS but some dissapointments,"I was having some problems with my Garmin iQue 3600, so I decided to order the Nuvi 360. It was a well built unit, quick to lock into the satellites and select a route. I was excited by the integrated Bluetooth, but those I spoke to over the mobile/bluetooth connection complained about the high noise level. Also, the 360 does have text to speech, but I found, at least in my area of NJ, that it often called out the Route number and not the street name, so this feature was not as useful as it might be. I ended up finding a fix for my iQue, and returned the 360 and will wait to see what the next iteration of GPS design has to offer."
1,Bluetooth function worthless,I paid extra last year for the 360 over less expensive models because of the bluetooth function. My phone is on the list of approved phones. Linking the phone was easy as was making or receiving calls from the device. The sound on my end was fine. The problem was on the other end. Callers complained that they couldn't hear me because of background noise. I tested it by having someone call my landline with the gps in bluetooth mode in a quiet room. The background noise and echo made it difficult to hear the caller in a quiet room. It's even worse when you add road noise to the background. The gps functions are easy to use but I can't recommend this unit because of bluetooth.
3,CONFUSED ?,I LOVE THE GPS. NO COMPLAINTS.I AM HOWEVER CONFUSED WHY THE PRICE DROPPED ABOUT $9.00 THE DAY AFTER I BOUGHT MINE ????????????
5,Good service and competitive price,I am very pleased with the Garmin Nuvi 360 GPS purchased from Amazon a while back. The price was competitive and the delivery service was outstanding.
3,sound level not loud enough,"Although I have adjusted for maximum loudness I often have difficulty hearing direction instructions. My Volvo is not exceptionally loud, there is the usual wind, engine and tire hum. Another problem is that the direction person often does not always enunciate clearly, (example) my street is Cresthill she pronunced it Crestal several times. My ears are 81 years old but they still hear OK in most circustances.Other than that problem I like the Garmin very much it seems much simpler to program than my $2000.00 Honda factory nav system. Do other users of the 360 have trouble hearing and understanding driving directions? Can anyone offer a solution?"
4,Don't know how I lived without it,"I have had the opportunity to test this GPS in New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. I don't know how I got by without it, especially at night in remote areas. While a Magellan fan for archaeology, Garmin's Nuvi 360 visual/voice navigation and satellite acquisition is excellent, however a bit slow on startup. While the screen is small (I use bifocals)it can be carried in the pocket. The bluetooth cell connection takes care of all 'hands on the wheel' issues. Problems: glare in the sunny western states is an annoying problem. I use the 'beanbag' mount but would rather have the unit closer to my eyes. In addition, after about 4 months of use the voice circuitry failed but Garmin issued an RMA and I am awaiting my replacement unit."
3,poor map,"This device and, I am sure all Garmin devices, uses very poor map source. The device itself is good, it finds you OK, in coordinates, but not on the map. The map source it is using is absolutely terrible. There are so many different maps on the market, why they are using this one? First it could not find properly my home, then it could not find the right route to my work. I mean it was off by a couple of blocks, good that I knew where I was going, but what about the other places. This map is not a map at all. It uses something that does not even exist. The way it shows my place does not exist for 30 years and today I had another bad experience going in circles on the same streets and finally it sent me to the right turn where there were not right turns. I own it just a week, it is very nice looking and featured device, but how can I rely on it?"
2,Maps not current.,"MAPS OUTDATED, HARD TO PROGRAM MULITIPLE destinations in to route. It looks for first turn instead of alternate faster routes. I like the size and carrying case. The voice is terrible. I tend to look at a map and plan route rather than relying on this. I am a realtor."
3,"Great size ,screen only easily viewed at night","I really like the Nuvi 360, it is very easy to use and shows everything you would want it to. The two problems are it is very difficult to see during the day as a result of glare. The bluetooth is very nice to use, except when you are actually driving. From the sound of the road noise you simply can not hear the person's voice and they have difficulty hearing you.I have decided to take it back to the store and buy, for nearly $200 more, the Nuvi 660. It comes with the traffic receiver built in and you can hear the person's voice on the other end through your car speakers with the FM modulator that is built in."
2,disapointted,"I got my Nuvi 360, it worked well for a couple of weeks , but the sound (voice) went out and now all I have is the visual, then you realized how much you need the voice, specially when driving alone.I'm on a job with lots of driving and I have not time to return the Nuvi, so for now I hate the damm thing, I think that for this price the quality sould be better.So I'm very disapointted and I want my money back, don't buy it.alberto"
2,Shipping was via DHL and it stunk,Great product but next day shipping with DHL took over a week to get. So don't bother to pay extra for quick shipping because it doesn't work!!
4,Overall a very useful product,I liked nuvi 360 than any other GPS models. I didn't find it necessary to spend money on wide screen models as they don't add any value to the primary purpose of it.IMPORTANT TIP: Remember to download the latest maps and software from Garmin's website as soon as you purchase nuvi 360. They are free download for 60 days and helps a lot in navigating newest points of interest.The suction mount in the box is extremly handy and reduces the need for purchasing any additional accessories (unless your state law disallow it)The only item I have found slightly frustrating is the absense of QWERTY touch pad. The existing alphabetic sequential keypad takes long time to enter addresses.
3,Decent GPS,"I bought this about six months ago and it has a lot of features, but the lag on the map when driving stinks. I have had Garmin and Tomtom and I will stay with Tomtom for my next GPS."
2,Poor device from Garmin :(,"I was very disappointed with this product for 3 specific reasons. I had a Garmin device prior to this one that I loved.First, this device worked *once*, after which it would only simulate routes. I turned it off and on, reset the device, and still couldn't get it to navigate for me.Secondly, the text entry input is not qwerty, it's alphabetical, which makes it extremely difficult to type in Anything.Third, I'm used to being able to see the history of what I've searched for, which is very useful.Overall, I didn't use the device very much because I got too frustrated with it. What I recommend is to make SURE you test a device in store before ordering one."
2,Garmin nüvi 360 3.5-Inch Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator,Garmin nüvi 360 3.5-Inch Bluetooth Portable GPS NavigatorVolume too low
4,Great product,"I am very happy with this GPS navigator so far. I like the fact that you can enter multiple destinations and the unit will guide you to each one. I also like that you can look up various points of interest- either by category or by name. The one thing that I wish worked better is when your course comes to a detour, one can push detour and the route will recalculate. However if the road is detoured for several miles, it will keep recalculating to try to guide you back onto the same road. I know that the maps that are loaded do not have every detour programmed into them, nor could they. But it would be helpful if you could somehow manually program in detours so the unit wouldn't keep trying to route you through those roads."
5,The best purchase I have made in a long time!,I have been using my Garmin for a couple of months and absolutely love it! The only change I would make is that they should use route numbers along with street names. We have found that sometimes there are no street names visible.
4,Nuvi 360,The product is very good. The maps for streets and directions work well. I would like to see a topo map system for the unit for off road use.
5,garmin 360,excellent product does everything I need it to and them some well worth the money. I recommend the garmin nuvi 360 to everyone.
4,Does What It's Suppose To,"I've never had a GPS before, so this has been a bit hard to figure out. But we found that it's precise with the directions and arrival times. Haven't worked the other functions yet."
4,"Overall exellent, still some cons","I've been using this GPS before, now I get it and try it again on a 4 hrs trip. Basically, it's a great product, the directions are accurate, the voice are big enough, also many accessory functions like bluetooth, nearby restaurants...One thing I notice is that, sometimes, it just couldn't find any signal no matter where you are. And you have to restart it, this is little bit annoying."
4,As good as GPS gets -- which is still not perfect,"Display is bright and clear. It kept falling off the windshield till we realized we needed to lick the suction cup first. As far as GPS units go, this one is a terrific buy. It's GPS itself, alas, which is still flawed: sometimes directions are spot on, other times roundabout or just plain wrong."
5,San Diego with Ease,"I purchased this before a vacation trip to San Diego in Feb. I did not set it up nor use it until after I had reached my destination. I was able to set it up within minutes--it is intuitive in what you need to do and info to enter, screen to touch etc... I had several places to go and see, it took me there each time. I was not familiar with the city nor had I driven in San Diego before, nor used a GPS!! The voice directions take a minute to get used to just because of the inflection/pronounciation. Queing was good as long as you listen-I only missed one turn the whole week. Battery life is good. I didn not have to recharge every day. Though I was a bit concerned because it was not the wide screen, I had no problems at all as far as size of the buttons when touching or with viewing the map. Colors on maps are bright and distinct. I am very happy & impressed with it and so were my friends, so much so that they are looking at buying one!"
3,Great for the price,"Screen size: decent, but a little smaller than I'm used to. 4.3 inches is better.Maps: I got a free update to the 2009 map.Spoken directions/text-to-speech: more voice options than TomTom One XL-S.Bluetooth: sync with Bluetooth phones is nice.Itinerary management: No itinerary creating ability. Can only set one stop point on a route. Or, add each stop to your favorites and manually select each as your next destination.Address storing: Stores the original street address, so it will display the house number when you arrive. TomTom One XL-S converts address to coordinates."
4,Pro on the Go,"This item is used by an Inspector, that is sent out daily to inspect houses throughout the City. The Garmin nuvi 360 is an excellant item that gives good verbal directions indcating street names(necessary while driving alone), it is small which is a plus when you are forced to carry it along with your work all day. However, street names change and this GPS unit does not have some of the newer(1-3 years)street names in it.I would still give this Item thumbs up because the good out weights the bad."
4,Nuvi 360,"When I ordered the nuvi didn't know what to expect. Pleasantly surprised,it works wonderfully out of the box. Only complaint I have is the backroads function is not as accurate as I expected it to be. If it is to be used for freeway and quickest route a wonderful tool to have."
2,Broke in 13 months,"I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with the Garmin GPS Navi. I would often lose satellite reception driving through the streets of SF and end up dazed and confused trying to follow it's erratic directions. Not to say that having a GPS system isn't at times a life-saver, my Garmin was not something I would want to heavily depend on.On top of the poor reception and long route calculating time, the Garmin does not hold up to the test of time. I drove down to LA two weeks ago and it literally just ""died"" an hour into my trip. It shut down and no matter how I tried to resuscitate some life back into it, it refused to turn back on. The screen did a weird blinking thing, perhaps to show me that it was trying but knew things were beyond hope. Sadly, the warranty ran out the month before and now I have to chuck it and replace it with a new one."
4,Great GPS,"HIWe got the Garmin Nuvi 360 gps for about a week now. The item works great. Although the charge didn't hold really long, around 2 hours or a little over. So make sure you keep it charge. Lot of people thought this device couldn't be used when plug the car charger to it. Actually you can, you have to use the attachment that attached to the back of the device, notice there also a hole where you can plug in your charger. Once you use that, you can use it while charging the device.We couldn't get the blue tooth working at first. We went to the Garmin web site and get the latest firmware from them and we got it to work like a charm. They got this software called WebUpdater, once you run that with your device, it will make sure you have everything up to date on your GPS.Thomas..."
4,WOW!,"This product is amazing. I was not expecting the bluetooth phone quality to be any good but i was wrong, the quality is perfect. I live in san antonio, tx and the satellite signal never drops. It fits in the palm of my hand. My fingers are a bit bigger than most and it is still very easy to type on it. I know it is not a very big deal but you can change the car symbol on the map to an arrow or a monster truck both blue like the car which i thought was pretty cool. The battery last forever. It is good for at least 8 hours. And the points of interest are great, it has a list of all the restaurants, gas station, and hotels in my area."
3,Garmin Nuvi 360,Works great. Maps of new subdivisions not updated (not on MapQuest either though). Has a nasty habit of locking up the cell phone partnered with it. Have to remove batteries to unlock. Problem is becoming less frequent with more use. Have not found a cause.
2,"Great Graphics, Let down on route selection",I bought the nuvi 360 to drive to Disney from Massachusetts. Its a nice little unit. Great color and good menus. The drive is simple for most of the way. Route 91 to Route 95 then to Route 4 at Daytona beach. The nuvi could not keep this in mind and kept giving me instructions to get off virtually every ramp I passed in metropolitan aresas. I got so sick of hearing this that I had to turn off the voice prompting. It made no difference whether I picked the option of shorter route or fastest time. Its strength is in local driving and using it to find your car at the huge Disney parking lots using the off road choice. It needs a software update to increase options of alternate routing by choice.
4,Garmin Nuvi 360,I have had the Nuvi for a little over a month and I love it. It provides accurate directions and the bluetooth is great. The one issue that I keep experiencing however is that the windshield mount keeps falling off. I have e-mailed Garmin but have received no response and when I called customer service the hold time is on average 30 minutes. Hopefully they can come up with a better designed windshield mount. If it wasn't for this issue I would rate it 5 stars.11/19/2006 I was able to speak to Tech Support about the issues with the windshield mount. They said that if you use an alcohol wipe to remove the excess film from the suction cup the mount will work. The film is from the cover that is used to protect the suction cup when the mount is sold new. I used the alcohol wipe and the mount now works!!!
2,Antenna dies after two years,"Used a 360 for two years, was generally happy with it. Then, satellites started going away after it was on a minute or so.Found instructions on the internet on how to crack the case open yourself. Was able to do that, but couldn't see anything wrong. Might come in handy when the internal battery dies.Based on experiences others have posted, tried the cheap $11 external antenna. Worked great. Nice unit, small with a strong magnetic mount.Have a friend with a 350, he has the flakey power switch that others have reported. I've been a long-term Garmin fan, starting with a GPS 12, but really disappointed in how the quality has gone down as they try to compete in the cheap sat-nav market.At this point, no reason to be buying a 300 series, the 200 series are cheaper and maybe don't have these two issues. Time will tell."
4,"great gps, except the Nuvi's are prone to power button failure","My Nuvi 360 is great gps. ,I bought lifetime maps, and they get updated quarterly, it is easy to use. When I found the power button no longer worked, I discovered that NUVI models are prone to power button failure because the switch pops pops of the circuit board. hopefully Garmin will fix it, guess i'll update when i find out..."
4,"Simple to Use, Reliable","I bought this unit 2 years ago used after a coworker let me try hers out for several days. It has been nothing but great.The satellite tracker is much quicker than the Magellan unit I gave away and the visual mapping system is great...easy to read and responsive when zooming in/out. All the other extras/options are helpful, very easy to use and simple to use if you are not into high tech. Also, the unit is nice and small so it travels well and can easily be carried in your pocket if sightseeing on vacation.The only downside is that the volume is not nearly loud enough even when there is little road noise. The only way to hear the directions when driving is to put the unit directly up to your ear which is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.Overall, this is a great unit, especially for price."
3,"Garmin Nuvi 360 ok, but wont knock your socks off","I got this for my wife so that she wouldnt have to mapquest for every place she went. Generally works ok, but some directions are just wrong. She was told by unit to go west where two interstates meet in Nashville and then it promptly told her to get off the highway and go the other direction...a mistake that took 5-10 minutes to backtrack from. The zoom in/out is a little tedious to use...takes too long to find the right magnification to be most useful. Battery life ok. Picks up satellite signal well. Maximum volume could be a bit louder. Certainly small and convenient in size. I love some of the trip statistics it makes available. All in all, would recommend, but you still need to have a brain and look at the map rather than relying on the mindless directions provided verbally."
4,Garmin Nuvi 360 review,"An overall well designed product that I would strongly recommend to other potential users. The module is compact, of the right size for mobility, lightweight and easy to use. It's touch screen interface is simple to use with good colour scheme and contrasts. It is worth mentioning that the GPS unit can be charged using the USB cable (that links to your computer) , a 12V car charger and also wall charger .......all of these are included in the box."
5,Garmin Nuvi 360,"We bought this Garmin last month before a long trip from FL to VT with stops in Ashville, NC, Long Island, NY, Yorktown Heights, NY and CT. It never failed to get us where we wanted to go. (New York traffic is tough.)The screen is small and hard to see if in direct sunlight, but I, as navigator and not driving, often handheld it when crucial turns were coming up. It came with every attachment you will need and we set it up right out of the box.Very pleased with this unit and would certainly recommend it."
4,found it useful,Helped us very much during our vacation to california. no printout of maps to carry..Still waiting to explore the bluetooth feature.
4,Great Buy,"This is my first GPS and so far I like it! The screen is a great size, the graphics are clear and you can zoom in and out of the map, so you can anticipate where you are going. I haven't had any trouble reaching a satellite signal, which I hear is a common problem on many GPSs. It was very easy to set up and it is easy to use.The search feature to find local businesses is great! Probably the most useful tool on this GPS for me. The only con I have is that the on-screen keyboard is not a QWERTY. It's in alphabetical order and it makes typing inconvenient."
3,Can't Go Wrong With A Garmin,I own the Garmin 260W I bought this one for my wife. It works well and gets her where she needs to go. I gave it a three star because it has a pop up antenna which the 260W doesn't have. It works very well.
3,Too many choices,"I wanted a GPS with bluetooth and the Garmin nuvi 360 does that just fine but I also wanted one that would allow me to download routes starting at a point, following a dedcated route to an ending point. Apparently this unit can not but it accepts GPX waypoint files from Mapsource but I haven't been able to find out what that is. I have not been able to find good info on Garmin and nothing on Mapsource."
2,Did you say something?,"I've had it a week now and this is my first GPS..Pros: Simple to use. Acquires satellites in 2 minutes or less. Unlike some other Garmin models the 360 comes with all the accessories you need.Cons: I bought this unit primarily for its TTS feature and because I think taking your eyes off the road for even a few seconds is dangerous. The TTS works wonderfully and gives good directions with enough lead time. When you can hear it. And that's the problem with this unit. The volume (even on its highest setting) is too low to be heard above typical car noise levels. So, since TTS is my most desired feature, I'll be retuning it."
3,Equipment is OK by accessories not.,"I bought a Garmin GPS. The equipment seems to work well. But the window mount is deficient and sometimes drops it down. Well, Now I understand that this had been the reason for its lower price."
3,not as great as i thought it would be...,"ok so its definitely better than my previous gps (garmin nuvi 200) but not extremely happy with it. first off when i get a call via bluetooth, the voice doesnt come back on once my call disconnects. i emailed garmin and was given a link to upgrade something but i havent had the chance to try it yet. also, i used it for a trip to Ikea in Paramus, NJ. It was closed on Sundays so we went to the Ikea in Elizabeth and i could swear it took me thru every side street to get there! ARGH! Also, when it recalculates, it seems to make you flip a u-turn and try again instead of just re-routing you completely. on the other hand, it has come in handy for a couple other trips. the bluetooth is convenient, hopefully that link will fix my problem."
4,I like it but the Bluetooth is not what I hoped,This is the 1st GPS that I have owned and found it very helpful during a recent vacation. Overall the routing is good but in the local area it is not picking the more direct routes. It keeps wanting to take me to the interstate to get every where. This combined with the power of my Blackberry / Google maps gives me many more millions of POI.The Bluetooth connected fine with my Blackberry Pearl. What I don't like is the sound quality to the people I am calling (garbeled) using the built in microphone.
5,Love my nuvi 360!,"So this is very easy to use, user friendly, and very reliable. It's packed with features like the mp3 player, audiobook player, bluetooth functionality, etc. You can download different types of vehicles to be reflected on your screen. You can choose the voice dialect,in terms of someone from a different country, whether they're male or female, etc....I use this around town and take it with me on out of town trips as well. It's the best. I can find where I need to go without needing maps, calling information or stopping for info. I also love that when it locates where you're looking for, it displays the address and the telephone number, so you never need to use the yellow pages, or dial 411 when needing to call a business. This product is awesome, filled with numerous features and worth the investment."
4,GPS with Cool Features,"In-built blue tooth works very good. GPS is pretty accurate, used it to drive from NJ to Atlanta, GA, did not hiccup once. Announces street names and the charge holds pretty good. The only con i found is the the connector that charges GPS is bit awkward, you would need to remove the GPS from the windshield before you can connect. Overall i am happy with the purchase."
2,2 stars as i am not AS lost anymore,"this unit is expensive and does not deliver as i expected. i am unsure as to why it takes FOREVER to find satellite reception, and this really impacts on its usefulness. maybe it is because i live in NYC?? as far as updating it. i have used to computers- mac and PC platform, connected to the garmin website and no luck. this was VERY frustrating. so overall, not a good purchase, and definitely at risk for finding a new home on the side of the highway one day."
4,Nearly Perfect,"This Garmin has great sensitivity. It does not need to be on the dash to get a good signal. Garmin should have included the ability for more ""way or via"" points. One is not enough."
5,Excellent,I purchased this product as a gift and I've gotten more use out of it. I've never used such a simple electronic device.
4,Nuvi 360,Does everything as advertised. Unlike the Garmin 76 CS I have as a back up for my boat the Nuvi is very intuitive and I was able to use it right out of the box without a manual. Good product.
4,Amazing little device,"I bought the Garmin for my wife, at her request, and we both are very impressed. The unit is easy to use and powerful. Now I just need one for myself."
5,Search feature is great,Just in checking it out I typed in Hospital. It quickly provided names and distances to nearby hospitals. One more click and it provided directions. Also works for places like McDonalds. Very nice when traveling away from home.
4,great product for the money,GPS Nuvi 360 works terrific - used on my trip to the Berkshires in Stockbridge Massachusetts - made good time and didn't get lost made good time - would definitely recommend this product. Amazon shipment was prompt received a few days sooner.
5,Nifty Little Helper,"We debated between ourselves about which model to buy. We knew we wanted a Garmin, having owned a couple over the years. My husband wanted the larger screen, but for our use, we couldn't justify the increased price.She does a very good job of navigation, although we don't always agree with her choice of directions. ;) We can't seem to retrain her, though.The Bluetooth connection is a wonderful tool, enabling us to use our cellphone hands-free, and very clearly. We're glad we chose it."
3,worked for several months,I purchased this in March and when it worked it was great. But now by August it is broken. I have spent part of the time out of the country so my Nuvi 360 has been sitting on my desk unused. Today I needed it and it can't connect and find the Sat signal. It asks if I am indoors while I am in my car and then asks if I am more than 100 miles from where I used it last. Well that became true as I drove and it still could not capture a signal. I hope the turnaround is fast on the repair!
4,GPS rules,"Excellent unit, with quite impressive street-level detail. Would be better if it had more potent, replaceable battery pack.Software is rather expensive, hard to find discounted."
2,Recent purchase of Garmin 360,"Before I receeived the item, price went down on Amazon, I informed Amazon. They took no responsibility other that to tell me to conatact Beach Camera. I contacted Beach Camera. There was no reponse from Beach Camera. What a customer service!"
1,BUYER BEWARE! This product is DISCONTINUED from Garmin,"I ordered this product for a Christmas gift only to find out that it has been discontinued from Garmin. The maps its comes with for this product, sold as ""New"", are two years out of date. Shame on you Amazon for not being forthcoming about this."
3,Navigational Problems,"Haven't used it that much, however, it was unable to find a location of a street that had been in existence for at least a year and a half. It also indicated a much longer estimated traveling time then what it actually was. How do you get updates for this GPS system?"
4,garmin nuvi 360,"Overall very pleased with this product. My only issue has been, a few wrong directions out of my own immediate area. I would and have recommended it to others."
4,Excellent Toy,"I did a lot of shopping, review reading and comparing. I don't have the expertise to know if the 360 is ""the best"", however I will say that for the modest price paid to Amazon for this item, it has exceeded my expectations in all categories. The mapping is up to date, the speed at which it functions more than keeps up with me, the blue tooth works perfectly with my blackberry. I also purchased the accessory microphone for the hands free. In looking for a new car someday in the near future I will be looking for one without a navi system just so I can continue to use this one!"
5,awesome,"pros:1) very intuitive and user friendly2) bluetooth is very useful. I use it with blackberry pearl.3) nice and small, fits into your pocket.cons:1) sometimes takes ridiculous amount of time to acquire satellites2) i upgraded bluetooth software, unfortunately on both the blackberry and nuvi at the same time and now connection drops sometimes. I hope they'll figure it out and give a fix soon. still gets a 5 star from me."
4,Fast and fairly accurate,"I like this unit very much, it has so many neat feature, I personally like the Bluetoot. It reboot fairly fast finding an address is a easy and accurate. I would of give it 5 star if the route choices where more user frindly. This unit has 3 option for route choice.1) Fastest time, 2)Shortest distance and 3) off road ???1)Fates time, will always try to take you through the highway, which not necessary always the fastest route.2) Shortest Distance, Choices of route is iffybuying a separate traffic report unit is another negative thing about this unit. thinking of this almost making me feel like want to give it 3 star :)"
4,love it,"great thing. my only gripe: not so great at catching a signal when I'm walking around (i.e. not in the car). but I'm usually driving, so it's not really a pressing problem."
4,Overall a great item; some glitches to be aware of,"We recently took a trip to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and, having never been there before, had no idea where anything was. So we used our navigator a lot. Easy to use, map is clear, good verbal directions and loud enough speakers to hear directions. Plugged in Mexican Food and it found several restaurants in the area and told how far each was from where we were, etc.Occasionally it was off a little -- e.g., to hotel it said turn left and hotel would be on left, but actually it was turn left and hotel was on right. Also, one place we wanted to go it showed us and directed us to it, but the place was no longer there. But, overall, it was accurate 98 percent of the time and was a huge help in a city we had no clue about. Good bargain for the price.We have just gotten bluetooth phones and have not had a chance to use them with this unit, so can't comment on that."
3,I wish it would take me where I wanted to go.,"I bought the Garmin 360 because a friend had the 350 and loved it. The 360's preset maps were worthless and I couldn't justify spending more money for maps. Roads that have been around for over 10 years didn't show up so the directions i got were very round-about. The bluetooth worked great if you were parked, but talking while driving was next to impossible. I returned my unit and since then there have certainly been times that I wish I had it as I drove aimlessly through Greesboro, NC. So for now I will use MapQuest and hope I don't get lost."
4,Garmin Nuvi 360 Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator,I had only seen a couple of GPS' so bought on what I had seen. I have used it on a trip from Florida to Wisconsin and Iowa and worked fine. Especially like the bluetooth for our cellphone for hands off operation while I am driving. Would recommend this one!
5,Excelente Lo recomiendo / Excellent I recommend it,"Hola, soy de Venezuela y compré este GPS hace un mes (es mi primer GPS) hasta ahora me ha parecido muy bueno, me ha llevado a todos lados y además viene con todos sus accesorios a diferencia de muchos otros. Lo recomiendo 100%, se obtiene más de lo que se paga./Hello, I'm from Venezuela and I bought this GPS a month ago (my first GPS) so far I have found very good, it has taken me me to everywhere and come with all accessories unlike many others. I recommend it 100%, you get more than you paid."
3,Pretty good But sometimes fustrating,"I was pretty happy with the Garmin GPS. It was small and very portable. everything that it said it was. i really liked that it says what streets to turn on. however, i recently used it in st louis, mo and i have never been there. st louis is doing construction on one of its main major highways so there were many detours. The gps had problems recalibrating the detours, it wanted it us to get back on I-64 which was closed. that got really annoying having the gps talking to you all the time. and another thing was that when in the city, we went through a lot of small neighborhood streets instead of taking the main streets to certain places. that was extremely a nuisance since many of the side streets had 4-way stops.All in all, it was really nice to have since we would have been lost if we didnt have it, but sometimes, nothing really beats a regular map."
5,Couldn't be easier,Exceptional electronic -- works right out of the box! Very easy to use and follow. I recommend without any negatives.
5,My savior,"I entered a lengthy review of this product on epinions last year with good points and shortcomings. Just an update a year later. It has every feature I need, got me out of Raleigh, NC and home 70 miles away in the dark last night. Had no idea where I was - still don't. Night mode, colored turns, warnings, zooms in when needed to show every little detail, clear voice. Perhaps less expensive models are as good, I don't know. I used bluetooth once as a curiosity - it works. I am 72 and occasionally get turned around, or, as my wife would say: I am the only person she ever met who can get lost in a square. Screen looks too small but it isn't.Just buy it."
4,Great GPS for affordable price,"I purchased the Nuvi 360 to navigate the unknown roads of central California for work. The GPS functionality of the 360 is great provided you set the system up properly. You can avoid or allow certain parameters for the travel (highways, toll roads, u-turns, etc) which make travel convenient. I made several left turns to get turned around to find out that I had clicked to avoid u-turns. The maps are installed so there are no downloads needed. Several locations that are under construction in CA allow the system to tell me to return to the right road or that it is recalculating the route. Overall, great GPS for the money. It has other features as Bluetooth capabilities, MP3 player, and picture viewer. None of these features will meet most users expectation. I have used the Bluetooth for my cell phone with extremely poor results.Even with the downsides to the Nuvi 360, I would definitely purchase another and recommend it to others."
3,Garmin Nuvi 360,"This is my third Garmin GPS. I bought the Garmin brand again because I was really happy with the two previous units. I do love this model's streamlined shape and the fact that it speaks the directions with street names. My short experience with it, however, makes me believe it is not as accurate as my two previous models. It also doesn't seem to hold a charge the way it should. I discharged the unit totally and then charged it for two full days. It didn't make any difference. It's still fairly new, so I will continue to use it and keep an eye on it."
5,easy to use,"I actually bought this GPS for my son after already buying a 660 for myself last year. This is my second GPS, the first being a Lowrance iWay 500C. After having both, I can honestly say this is easier to use and is much easier to update. It finds almost every address I enter, and I have had no problems with the NUVI."
5,It's a Foolsproof GPS,"Yes, anyone can handle it, very easy to handle, you can go wherever you want even without reading much from it's owner manual in case of people who never had a GPS, and the posibility of carrying music files in mp3 to listen through your car's sound eq. is great, is another thing less you need to carry with you: Your iPod. And the traveler's guide it has with language tips is very helpful whenever you are in a country with a language youdon't speak.I'm very glad with my Nüvi 360."
3,Garmin nuvi 360,"Just took a trip to Portland, OR and the GPS worked fine. A couple times it tried to get me lost but I knew the correct route and it recalculated and got back on track when I didn't use it's directions. Hope this doesn't happen where I really don't know my way around.Bought this one because of the Audio Books capabilities. Never saw anywhere, not on Amazon's product description or any of the reviews I read, that a monthly subscription was needed to download books to it. This is very disappointing, I am still trying to figure out a way around this since my library has audio books that can be downloaded for free."
5,Garmin Nuvi 360,I recently bought the Garmin Nuvi 360 and love it. I have tried several other GPS's and this one is great and you can't beat the current price!
4,Great product,"This product is amazing. Haven't had any trouble using or mounting it. Sometimes the satellite signals are lost creating bit of an inconvenience. I have also seen cases where it didn't speak up at some turns where it was supposed to. I thought the signal is lost, but that wasn't the case. Sometimes the map seemed to contain wrong street address, not sure if it was due to not having the updated map."
5,Very please so far,"We just got our Nuvi and so far , so good. It is small and compact, good speaker. The screen picture is great. It was a toss up between this is and the 350 - the only differenct being bluetooth. Since we happen to have one of the phones compatible we got the 360 - not much price difference between the two either. If you don't have a compatible bluetooth phone go with the 350 to save a few bucks. We looked at a lot of GPS systems and really disliked the ones that were bulky , the Nuvi is sleek and small, very nice product."
2,Decent GPS until the power button fails,"I have owned my Nuvi 360 for over a year, and had no problems with it until the last few months. The power button on these units is constructed poorly. It is set under a piece of plastic, and after repeated use, can get pushed down too far for it to turn on. I went in under the plastic tab to turn it on and it stopped working completely. The product overall is good except for this faulty hardware. Please be aware of this if you are thinking of purchasing this unit. I am buying a new one, and I am going with the Nuvi 265 (the power switch is a sliding switch on this model!) I hope garmin doesn't let me down a second time!"
4,Very pleased with this Garmin,"I have been very pleased with this Garmin. I recently used it on a 12 hour road trip. It worked well navigating my route, even through construction areas. The only feature I wish that could change is the voice. I have only been able to find one voice in English. It is a female voice and it is very computerized sounding. This probably makes sense so it can provide turn by turn directions (naming streets/locations). I love that this is able to give exact turns though. It's a little pro/con about the device. Otherwise, overall, I love this GPS. IT came with the mount, carrying case, USB power cord. A lot of good stuff for a great price."
4,"Great lttle machine, but...","Easy to use right out-of-the-box! Good battery life and great size. I've used it locally and long distances and it has always gotten me there, although sometimes it doesn't take the shortest route. If I was asked what needs to be improved on the 360 it would be to update the POI's...It has some places that are no longer open and doesn't have newer establishments. #2 - the bluetooth is not worth the extra $50. The voice quality and volume are low.IMOHO...Get the 350...you'll have a great little GPS unit and save $50!"
4,Nuvi 360,"Nuvi 360 works fine, but maps are not always current; for instance freeway 202 in Phoenix area isn't on it. We bought a printed map a year ago that had the new 202 on it. We've downloaded the most current maps available & are disappointed about the dated information we got.We LOVE listening to books on it as we drive. The directions come through,but sometimes are tricky to hear when there's a book on. We've learned to turn off the book while traveling through cities & towns to ensure that we get the details we need.We liked being able to identify nearby shopping, motels, or restaurants. (Although motels are not always where they're supposed to be; store locations were very good.)We really liked being able to enter our destination address & have Nuvi lead us there. It got us through convoluted streets in San Antonio with ease. It does quite well in cities; rural mapping seems weak.We broke it in on a 1300 mile trip from AZ to TX & return in December."
1,Misleading advertising,"Returned the unit because I assumed text-to-speech meant the street names would be spoken. I was wrong or the term is misleading. Also, the window attachment did not stay in place."
1,Garmin nuvi 360 gps,"I was dissapointed in the 360. I couldn't connect to it with bluetooth. It wasn't able to get us to all the houses we were looking for during house hunting, although I think some of that is related to new neighborhoods not on the map yet. Not intuitive enough. I tried the Tomtom Go 720 it wasn't any better although I liked the screen graphics better and the options."
2,Garmin nuvi 360,The Garmin nuvi 360 would be a good product except the speaker volume is extremely weak. The only way the speaker can be heard is stopped and no other noise nearby. This is with the speaker volume turned to maximum. Adding an external speaker does not help unless the external speaker is amplified.
5,All We Need,"The 360 is perfect for me. The Bluetooth capabilities make it nice and easy to make handsfree phone calls. Also love the option of plugging up the MP3 player to the vehicle's audio system. I thought the 3.5 screen would be too small but it's very easy to see. I would have liked to have had the arm that holds the GPS longer to be able to keep the GPS out of the sun. The sun can make it hard to view the screen and I think if the arm was longer I could have it lower to remedy that. For the price, it's a great buy."
4,Nuvi 360,working good so far. the only problem i have had is that the blue tooth will not pair with my current cell phone. Check the garmin site for compatible cell phones.
2,Dosen't work well in big cities,"I used it for my travel to NYC and Boston during the past 4 days. It helped me get to places but I only give it 2 out of 5 point because it's supposed to do better.The worst thing with it is it doesn't direct you when you are on ""unhighlighted"" roads, which you're frequently on when you make stops. You have to find your way to the highlighted ways. I don't like it.Also, it often got confused in cities and gave wrong direction because it didn't know which road I were on.Another reminder, don't trust the dining places it provides, so outdated.It's an OK device but you can expect better. Even the gps system in my cell phone can do better."
4,Wish I Got it From Costco,"I bought this sucker for almost $550 from Amazon 3 years ago and it has been really handy in getting me to places I've never been (e.g. courthouse, restaurants, etc.) I even had the guts to drive up to Northern California armed with nothing but this. I bought the more expensive model at the time (versus the 350) and regret it because I don't really see a difference. The 350 doesn't play music, but you can't play music on this thing anyway without buying the service (which I was not willing to do; I thought I could've just transferred my mp3s onto it). It doesn't come with traffic reports, but for the basics, it is not bad. Wish I bought it from Costco because not long after I got it from Amazon, as you can see, it depreciated like hell and is technically outdated. It works great and I still use it. I don't think I will be buying a new one any time soon because it does the job in finding places (even if sometimes that means taking the long way)."
3,"I liked the product, but...",I liked the way the product worked. I've heard from others that have purchased this product and they said it is getting slower. I purchased this product a month away and I returned it to the Garmin company for a replacement.
3,performance and ease to operate,Garmin nüvi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator with Bluetooth and Text-to-Speechthis product could be easier to use if explanations were clearer. Performance is made difficult because of too many steps necessary to use properly.
2,"cryptic instructions, where is cust support?","Had my Garmin 360 a couple weeks, and the suction cup keeps falling off the windshield, dumping the whole thing on the floor. So I decided to go to the Garmin web site to see if I can get a new suction cup. Somehow I end up downloading a new map.Well, thats fine - I'd like the latest map. So, about an hour later (totally tying up my PC) it's downloaded and ready to install the update. Now the install window is asking for my product code that comes with the ""Install disk"". I don't know what they mean by the ""install disk"", there was no such disk - there is a CD with the owner's manual - but it has no ""product code"" on it. What is the stupid ""product code""? All I find in the plethora of paper that came with this unit is a serial number, a registration code, and an unlock code. None of these worked in the update install. This is very frustrating and I can't find a number for customer support.Anyway, hence the 2 stars."
4,Garmin Nuvi 360 - perfect value,"This Garmin Nuvi 360 is the 4th GPS system I have owned and is by far my favorite due to it's size, features and value. If you want a larger screen, this unit may not be for you. I prefer the smaller size that still has all the features I regularily use in a size that fits in my shirt pocket. The unit can be easily removed and installed from its window mount making it very portable. Love the bluetooth and the mini USB charger that also works on my phone saving me an extra power cord in my car."
4,Very Good Indeed,"The Garmin nüvi 360 is an excellent product. I used to have a StreetPilot C330 and upgraded to this one, so i'm not new when it comes to Garmin GPS navigator.Pros:Excellent software and features, usability and design.Cons:Low speaker volume on Text-to-speech voices."
4,Very useful and worth every penny of the purchase,"I bought it for my road trip from California to Washington and it worked like a charm. Its boot time is relatively fast and the software is very intuitive and easy to use.The only downside was that it doesn't have good reception in high building area; the processing became slow and a teeny bit inaccurate when I used it in Seattle downtown (hence minus 1 star, although it should be just 1/2 or maybe 1/8). However, in the end I managed to arrive at my destination without much difficulty.The package came with all equipment needed to use in a car, so I don't need to buy more. For $199, I don't think it can get better than Garmin nüvi 360. It's not an overstatement to say that it exceeded my expectation."
4,Good Value,I think this product does what it says it will do. It seems very reliable so far (2 weeks) and the bluetooth works great with my phone.
5,Greatest B-day Gift Ever!,"I have been researching GPS systems for a long time. Waiting for the price to come down, waiting for the systems to have better technology. I bought the 360 and all of the features are great. It tells you the exact road to turn on and zooms in when you turn. If you miss a turn it recalculates a new direction in seconds. If you know how to get to the city but not every street when you get there it will change to your route and then zoom in on the streets when you get close to them. It will list all restaurants and gas stations close to you along with telephone number. The features are accurate, quick and very easy to use. Haven't had a single problem yet."
1,How not to win customers,"I ordered the Garmin 360 based on reviews of the 350 for my husband's birthday. It arrived and he opened it. He actually read the instructions first - he then turned it on and chose language etc. The first thing you notice is that the manual is for the 310/360. The instructions did not match up with the accessories that were included in the box. O.K. so they did not update it so great, well it is made in Taiwan. But when he went to put it on again, it was deader than a door nail. We called tech support and were blown off. Nasty - Really third rate won't give out last names.We gave then ours. ""Jack"" couldn't be found when we called back. No email addresses for supervisor. Why do they hide? Called corporate put into voice mail. Bet you can count on them for service after the return time to Amazon. We will follow up - glutton for punishment asked for replacement."
1,Hopes of easy navigation shattered with the screen!,"I LOVED everything about my Garmin Nuvi 360 when I received it. This was my first navigation device and it was so easy to use! I was enjoying all the luxuries of easy navigation until I placed the unit in its carrying case and into my purse so it wouldn't get stolen out of my car. When I returned to my car and pulled out my Nuvi, the screen was shattered! This was within 14 days of receiving the unit, and Garmin would not cover this under warranty because they ""don't know how the screen cracked."" I don't think the screen is durable enough if it can't withstand a ride inside a purse inside its case. Just a warning! The repair for the screen is $86."
2,Not what I hoped for,"Maps are from April 06. It kept getting us lost in Orlando. Updated the firmware but it still gets lost around my home area. It will get you there eventually, but you sometimes waste a lot of gas getting there!"
3,"It's just OK , not so great as I have thought","This Nuvi360 is just Ok, not so great I have thought. Slow recalculatings and it has sometimes directed to a wrong way or totally wrong direction. Need to be reset in order to get back normal mode."
4,review of Garmon 360,Love the Garmon. Everything works well just would like it to tell me the directions a little sooner then right before the left turn comes up. I think I may miss my turn sometimes.
1,Garmbage,"The unit wouldn't acquire satellites until the third try, and then for maybe 30 seconds. It informed me that the condo I was sitting accross the street from was a 7-11 store. Then it said ""satellite signal weak"" and quit working. A visit to the Garmin site showed a very relaxed attitude about whether I should even expect it to work at all, with outlandish suggestions like placing it outside my car to get it to work (and it didn't). I live in the heart of Chicago so there's absolutely no excuse for it not to work. I'm on the lakefront so its view of the sky was completely unobstructed. I'll never buy anything made by Garmin again."
4,Good price Good Product,"I did about a week of research on the small screen GPS and this model had the features I was looking for in a GPS. Portability, small size, voice directions, blue tooth, etc. It worked right out of the box and is simple to operate. I think it is a discontinued model now, so that explained the low price. A product is obsolete when it no longer does it's job. This GPS is doing a great job for me."
3,Alternative routes?,"I wish this unit would allow the driver to choose alternate routes -- I don't always want to drive the expressway or the fastest/most direct route. Once I vary from the prescribed route, this ""snotty"" voice (do I just imagine she's snotty?) keeps repeating ""recalculating"", insisting I get back to the expressway when I would much rather drive a more scenic (ocean view?) route. I believe I'm like most people -- I like choices."
4,Garmin Nuvi 360 GPS,"I purchased Garmin Nuvi 360 3.5"" GPS from Amazon a month back. This GPS is really small sleek and good. All the features are good like Navigation, Bluetooth and MP3 player.The only thing i didn't like is that when you Power ON the GPS it will take couple of minutes to accquire satelite signals. Rest is all ok."
4,Garmin 360,"Excellent and extremely portable device. I've used it several times on short and long trips and it works very well. The device is bright and easy to read, the speech to text is clear and precise. The bluetooth sync up with your wireless phone is a bit flaky out of the box, however it works flawlessly after you get the latest update from Garmin's website.The POIs are extensive and I often use my Garmin to find restaurants on the weekends. All in all a great portable device I plan on using for a long time."
4,Garmin nuvi360,recently i purchased Garmin nuvi360 GPS with blue-tooth and text to speach facility and it works great.I was looking for a GPS which comes in the price range of $180 to $250 with text to speach lane by lane direction and blue-tooth and even it has MP3 player as well.So i strongly recommend people to go for it if they want a GPS within medium price and great features.--------------Dilip
1,Nice product but unusable in a car,"A frustrating product. The hard stuff - Sat acquisition, POI database - it does very well. It fails on the simple stuff: getting $1 plastic parts to work. There is no way to mount it; Windshield mounts are illegal in Calif and regardless this mount does not stick, is hard to get the 360 to attach to, and is rumored to not stand up to sun very well. I bought the friction ""sand bag"" adapter and the 360 does not even fit. I am very disappointed.P.S. a UI flaw - if you wonder why you are not hearing street names, use/google English (TTS)"
4,Mostly great,Only complain is that sometimes it takes too long to capture the coordinates when you are starting it up. Otherwise it has been a great way to find my way around both at home or when traveling.
5,A versatile GPS,"This GPS is quite useful. There are some surprising uses, like finding food when visiting friends or a bank while traveling. If you are rough on things be careful with the connector that holds the car charger to the back (it will break if you don't release it before trying to remove the GPS). Note the price on these has dropped rapidly, and if you need traffic the once with MSN service might be a better value (when the price comes down)."
4,Great GPS Good Price,"I took my new Garmin NUVI 360 on my trip from Salt Lake City, Utah to Yellowstone. It worked great for most of the time even in very remote areas. I also got a GPS on my rental car but Garmin NUVI 360 outperform all the time. One limitation on GPS in general is that you have to have the exact street address in order to search for the best route. Without the street address, it is very hard to use the GPS function between different states. For example, I could not ask the GPS to pick a route for me from SLC to Yellowstone since I did not have the a street address of Yellowstone in Wyoming. Yet, once I was in Wyoming, I could use the ""Attraction"" function to look for Yellowstone. So, for cross country or states trip and you don't really have the street address of your destination, it will be helpful to print out a route from the internet first."
3,TEXT to SPEECH????,"I was under the impression that ""Text to Speech"" meant that the item would tell the NAME of the street (ex. ""turn right onto Main St. in 2 miles""). I was VERY dissappionted that the unit does not do this... I could have purchased the same type of unit much cheaper if I had known."
4,Fun Toy - Does What I Need it To,"This nuvi (360) is exactly what I needed. It's small and portable, and it gets me where I am going. I like the extras (e.g. music and pictures), but they're not essential. I did pick this one and pay a bit extra for the bluetooth feature, and I have already found that useful, when I'm driving. The only thing it's missing is the traffic capability. I would definitely recommend this GPS."
3,Helpful & Handy - But Could Use Some Improvements,"The Garmin nuvi 360 is a neat and helpful tool for my driving. I like the visuals and the language options makes it fun as well. Here are things they can improve: it could give on what lane to line up before a turn; the last turn alert is too close to the time one has to make the change; and the gadget that holds it on the dashboard (cannot place on the windshild in California) falls off easily, particualarly when it is hot."
3,Loss of Satellite signal,"I have had this Nuvi 360 for quite a few years and it has always had problems with picking up a signal, I sent it in once and didn,t do much good. About 2 or 3 weeks ago it lost satellite and put me locked up in Kansas. I tried everything to get it to work and nothing helped so I read some reviews about the Garmin satellite problems and people said that a $9.95 external antenna at Amazon would solve the problem. Well I got my antenna today went out in the back yard and plugged it into the 360 and now it works just fine. So I thank the people for the info and hope this review helps someone who has faced the same problem, good luck..PS as soon as I plugged the antenna in I got located back in Texas."
2,theirs many thing this gps wont find.,"if u look up something by name it takes like 20min to find it and the majority of da time if wont find it. the features on r ok, but the accuracy on it sux never use it anymore google maps on my phone blows this gps away any day..."
5,Awesome nav system.,"I bought the Nuvi 360 for my husband. He isn't one to be impressed with the lastest electronic devices, but he can't stop talking about this one. We have a service oriented business that he uses it for everyday. It has absolutely been priceless. Well worth the money."
2,Disappointed,"Thinks my street is 50 feet before it actually is, therefore recalculates before the turn.If I go a different route, it continually tries to get me to make a ""U"" turn.Instead of shortest or fastest route, it may pick one that is very roundabout (you should see how it wants me to drive home from work).Maps need to be updated more often. Street Atlas or Streets and Maps do a better job of being updated...I'd use them except I don't want to tie up a PC just to drive across town.It might work well for cross country, for me, it's an expensive toy that I have yet to develop trust in."
4,My opinion of the 360,"I bought the 360 for my husband's birthday. He didn't want it, said he'd never use it, so I use it in my car. Then, I took it to LA on vacation and now he's named her ""Peggy Sue"". We could not have made it around LA and Orange County without her. Technically I wish she would give a little more notice when telling us to turn right on the freeway when you have to move over 4 lanes (they drive VERY fast in LA), but we love her now and she will go with us everywhere from now on. VERY HAPPY! Oh - we also bought the weighted holder since it is illegal to attach the GPS to the windshield."
4,nuvi 360,"I have not used the nuvi 360 gps that much to give it a fair review, but it is easy to use and inter addresses and other things. In the next few months I will know more about it. I did notice that it will tell you to turn and not give you the street or road name and I did down load the latest info from the web site."
5,Garmin Nuvi 360,This navigation system is great! It is very easy to navigate. If you are not good with electronics this is the GPS to buy. Excellent system. Would highly recommend it.
2,Not very good,This stuff looks really nice right after it is applied but it doesn't have any durability whatsoever. Recently I've started using Mother's FX Tire Shine and it is a huge improvement over this product. Black Magic is very thin and watery which allows it to spin off and rinse off easy when it is wet out. The product from Mother's is very thick in comparison and doesn't sling off while giving a much better shine.
1,THIS STUFF IS KRAP--RUINED MY TIRES!!!!!!,"I JUST TRIED THIS FRICKIN KRAP ON MY BRAND NEW TIRES, FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS, AND WHERE THE PRODUCT CONTACTED THE RUBBER IN SPRAY AND SOME DRIPS, THERE ARE NOW RAISED MARKS IN THE RUBBER LIKE WELTS!!!! ITS COMPARABLE TO AN ALLERGIC REACTION ON YOUR SKIN OF RAISED WELTS. SO NOW WHERE THE SIDEWALL WAS SMOOTH BLACK, NOW ITS BUMPY. IM SO PISSED, AND IM CONTACTING BLACK MAGIC TO FILE A MAJOR COMPLAINT!!!!!!!"
4,Beautiful pieces of music,"There is only one song I cannot in good faith give praise on this cd. That being ""Space Bossa Nova"", which blasts through the ""Cheese threshold"" with no looking back. And I like cheesy music. Otherwise, the cd is a wonderful showcase of Evelyn Pope's composition, and a dry, unpolished work that can easily become a source of inspiration. My only other complaint is that while the lyrics are eloquently written, the central idea tends to repeat itself in a disconnected ""non-concept"" kind of way. But by all means, a wonderful cd."
3,Just Okay,"I am only about half way into this book, but I'm a little disappointed. I have never read one of Anne Graham Lotz's books and was hoping for a little less frill and more Scripture basis."
3,Tom Brokaw,I like Tom Brokaw so much (as many people do) that I thought this would make a nice gift for a cousin from the 'era' who experienced the war... I'm not sure those who have want to view photos from it that aren't theirs however...........
1,Disappointed!,"I just received my order. I was disappointed in the balance of the pan. When set empty on a flat counter, the weight of the handle causes it to tilt up and wobble. It takes over a cup of water to finally get it to stop teetering and to sit level and more to make it stable when stirring and not holding on to the handle. When making a white sauce and melting the butter first, you are required to stay with the pan and hold the handle until you can add enough ingredients to get it to stop teetering dangerously on the stove. Since the handle gets quite hot, you have to use a mitt. I don't have enough hands to cook with this pan![...]"
5,Great CD,Tweet is such an underrated singer. She has a great voice and her second CD is just as good as the first.
3,a little below average,"Tweet disappoints with a very slow-paced, boring set where almost every song sounds the same. Most songs are half-baked ideas or just plain lackluster and uninspired. A few tracks prove to be worthy of a listen, but most could have been left behind."
5,Great Purchase,"I couldn't wait for this cd to come out. I love Tweet and this cd shows here broad range of talent and skills. Her music is so arousing yet soothing all at the same time. I went through so many emotions while listening to this cd. My favorite song is ""I'm Done"".Tweet, you're just getting better and better.Buy this cd."
5,The Unexpected Extra,"I honestly was not going to buy this CD, but the first single is so hot! I loved this CD from the FIRST PLAY. It was worth the wait and the production of the tracks are amazing!Tweet's first CD was good, but this one has demostrated a serious growth of her talent. Tweet if you read this, GREAT JOB and you have a new fan!!!!!By the way by favorite tracks are:Turn the light offCould it beCab Ride (Love the sample!!!!!)Two of Us (With your daughter, nice touch)I Done (The sexiest break up song ever)People just get the CD, this is my first favorite for the year 2005!"
2,Not her best,"Tweet's New Album It's Me Again Falls Short From Her Last Album. I liked her Old Album It Had More Up Beat Tracks. Her First Single Turn Off The Lights With Missy Is A Good,But Din't Do Well. The Song Sports, Sex & Food Is Good. All The Songs Are All Slow."
3,"Info about ""Sports, Sex, and Food""","I've only heard a few samples from this record, but what I've heard isn't as good as her ""Humingbird"" CD. However, I'm writing this review to give some information on the song ""Sports, Sex, and Food"". Some have mentioned the music being vaudeville or jazzy. Well, it's neither. The music is sampled from late 60's-70's New Orleans funk band ""The Meters"". The song is ""Hey Pocky-Way"" and is practically an anthem down in New Orleans. Of course, the Meters had a different kind of funk and never went mainstream for musical reasons. As for ""Sports"", I don't like the song because the sample in its original form is so much better. I think those who don't like the music to ""Sports, Sex, and Food"" probably are not used to New Orleans funk like the Meters, but the Meters is definitely one of the greatest funk bands in history. Thought some of you may have wanted to know where the sample to ""Sports"" came from."
1,From Southern Hummingbird To Southern Bell,I mean I just couldn't get with the direction of this one. It started out like retrosoul and ended up at the cemetary. I could appreciate some of the music and melodies but as a whole the CD fell face down on it's face.
5,Up Close and Personal,"First I must state that I anxiously awaited the arrival of my cd based on how much I loved Southern Hummingbird. It was worth the wait, the first time I listened to It's Me Again, I wasn't diggin it, but then again I wasn't giving it my full and total attention. I popped my headphones on and really listened and I love it, haven't decided on my favorites yet although I love Iceberg and Turn off da lights. While not on the same level as Southern Hummingbird, it's still slammin and I love Tweet's voice."
4,Taxi thumb,"I love this cd, especially the ""taxi"" song. Her voice is so light and airy. She sings like humming bird. Love it!"
4,As always tweet shines...,Tweet is truly great artist who is underated. She shines her skills on this album just as she did her first album and this is an excellent follow up where she shows she has still got it.
5,MUCH better on sophmore effort!,"Second time *IS* a charm....at least it is for Tweet. I have her first CD as well (Southern Hummingbird) but it was one of those CD's that had a few good song's but that was it. This new CD shows a lot of growth and has a lot more variety to the lineup of songs. More of a balance between dance and slower song's. Tweet's voice is in fine form on this disc. I love the harmonies and the purity to her voice. The dance songs have a good bumpin' vibe to them and the slower songs have more of a verse/hook/chours to them which I think was lacking in a lot of the songs on her first CD.Standout tracks include: "" Turn Da Lights Off"" (Anything with Missy is GOLD), ""You"", ""Cab Ride"" (With a sample from the theme from the show Taxi), ""Sports, Sex & Food"", ""Where Do We Go From Here"" & ""We Don't Need No Water""They are all good. Very pleased with this purchase and you will be too if you are an existing Tweet fan or if you are looking for a new R&B; artist to check out."
4,Just Okay,"I really liked her first CD, the music, her vocals, the words. This CD I think fell short. Her vocals are covered up by the music, Missy kinda throws things off when she comes yelling on the track, her songs are not that long, it is as if she rushed to put her second CD. I am a little dissapointed but maybe it just needs some getting use to."
4,Good 2nd try,I have been a Tweet fan since day one. This CD surprised me as some soph attempts are often a rap. Love the CD and Tweet's suthern drawl. One Con: MISSY NEEDS TO FIND A NEW OUTLET FOR HER IMMATURE OUT BURSTS. She is not a man...or is she?
3,Hmmm...Sleeper,"Well, I recently picked up Tweet's Cd and I feel that this CD is almost on the verge of being partially depressing and dragged out. I must say that Tweet has a beautiful voice, however must she sing in the same drab high pitched key. The Cd is very mellow and I think some on the strongest tracks are: Turn Da Lights Off, Cab Ride, Small change and You. The rest of the songs don't impress me at all. Additionally, they all kinda sound the sound. If you're a Tweet fan definitely go out and buy this one. If your not then pass..."
2,Better than Southern Hummingbird,"First off i'd like to say that whoever spammed the reviews have too much time on their hands and need to get a life for real.This album was better than Southern Hummingbird, but thats not saying much especially since I didn't like nothing on Southern Hummingbird. The songs she did with Nisan Stewart (Cab Ride, Small Change, I'm Done) were the best songs on the album. All the rest were pretty much produced by Missy and they all sucked except ""You"". that makes 4 good songs, thats not a good percentage.Tweet w/ No Missy= Multiplatinum Success"
2,Decent Album from Seductive Southern Songtress,"Ignore my 2 star review that I originally rated this album with. Instead I now give this disc 3 stars because it is a decent effort now that I've listened to it, and it is growing on me. Those who fell in love with Tweet because of her suggestive songwriting, and Timbaland club beats will be a bit disappointed. There is no Timbaland on any of these tracks, but Missy does show up on a few cuts which are some of the highlights. I could do without a few songs which would probabaly make this album tighter. Despite the little flaws I have with this album, I'd recommend it more for mature young adults and the 25+ crowd. Highlights hear include ""Iceberg"", ""Could It Be"", ""Cabride (Taxi)"", ""Steer"", and ""We Don't Need No Water""."
2,I agree with the previous reviewer,"How can you do a book like this without before, during, and after photos? I think Jill was not happy with her results and didn't want to show her ""face"". Also, there is no mention of their ages which would have been very helpful. And - these women had much, much more than a facelift - laser, brow-lift, eyes done and maybe more. This book was a major disappointment!"
3,Fun read and nothing more than that!,"This is medieval/esotheric story about girl who tried to save herself from being burned alive and ended up in other world as a demon. Art is good, script is ok and if you like horror comic with a twist, you should buy Lady Death Recconing."
1,dave,If you are the type of person who is just wanting to hear someone ramble on to relax this is it. if you are like me and developing an interest in sailing and think you are buying a dvd to see nice scenery and learn places to go you will be disappointed.i wasn't interested in the fireplace or nature sounds.the title said sailboat.actually it looks like the guy is just wanting to show pictures of his boat sailing.i could not watch long enough to see if they even made any sail changes.if i had seen the back cover i would not have bought this
4,Classic El !,"This cd flashes back into time for me, El has always had a voice that stood out , clean , crispy and cool . I'm happy to add this to my ever growing cd collection."
3,Solo El DeBarge or DeBarge Greatest Hits Collection?,"As far as I'm concerned, the DeBarge Greatest Hits (not the Millineum Collection) is the better buy. Five of the songs on this collection are on the DeBarge's greatests hits c.d. - too bad El wasn't able to get ""secret garden"" song from Quincy Jones on this set like Al B. Sure! did on his greatest hits collection. Aside from the ""after the dance"" remake, I don't see buying this c.d. unless you just want to add El's solo work to your c.d. collection - still love you though, Eldra!"
4,I Like It!,"If you are a DeBarge fan (I am) or someone who is sick of hearing your friend the DeBarge fan, go on and on about El DeBarge, get this CD. After hearing it once, you'll be convinced of his talent too.While there are a few weak cuts on this album, especially the duet with Dionne Warwick, the majority of the songs showcase his vocal range, songwriting ability and his skills as a musician as well. Two cuts from the GEMINI album that never received much airplay, BROKEN DREAMS and TURN THE PAGE, are worth the price of the entire CD."
5,A Rare Find,"This is a very good collection... worth it the money..I have looked for the haunting ..TURN THE PAGE...so deep, so sad..."
4,1 and 2 Maccabees A New Translation,"The New translation of the Maccabees Bible took me down an historical and spirtual path of enlightenment that not only educated but also motivated me to apply many of the disciplines of the Maccabee dynasty in my own everyday life. For the scholar and the lay person alike, Goldstein's commentary provides additional insight into the terms, contradictions and many interpretations that abound within the Maccabees Bible. I personally found the books to be both insperational and educational."
5,It's About Time!,"This book finally tells you what it is you probably already know, if you're like me and have been reading just about every health/fitness/weight loss book out there. No gimmicks, no cajoling, no special ""diets"" or secret exercises based on blood type or body type or eye color... it's a JUST DO IT approach to weight loss and it's really, truly, the only way it'll work for you if you're looking for permanant results. There's only one way to lose weight, and that's to cut your intake in increase your exercise. Plain and simple. The way Dr. Kirschenbaum presents these truths is not only clear and understandable, but motivating and supportive as well. You really CAN do it. Others have, and heck, if *I* can do it, you can too!"
5,"Simply outstanding, a masterpiece","Kirschenbaum does it again. Like ""Weight Loss Through Persistence"", 9 Truths tells it like it is without any half-measures that would assure long term failure. By taking the long view, 9 Truths identifies the intensity of the weight loss effort itself as the most crucial variable. Weight loss isn't easy. But with the right knowledge and determination it can be done. Kirschenbaum emphasizes the importance of an hour of exercise daily, limits on fat and sugar (btw, 20 grams isn't that extreme for a fat limit, we only need 4 to 5 grams of essential fatty acids)and self-monitoring of our intake. 9 Truths doesn't patronize the reader and presents reliable and authoritative information about what it takes to achieve your ideal weight. It's a buy."
2,Reveals the depressing truth about low fat dieting...,"Wow, is this book depressing. Kirshenbaum's clients cut back their dietary fat TO THE BONE and can still only eke out slow, minimal weight loss.The bottom line: discipline, discipline, discpline. We're talking no-birthday-cake-on-your-birthday-kind of discipline! Mix that in with some serious patience and a little psychological counseling, and after several years you may be able to move from ""obese"" to merely ""overweight.""I don't doubt that this is ""the truth"" about dieting his way; I just found it incredibly discouraging. Indeed, after reading this, I knew there was NO WAY I'd ever be successful as a low fat dieter. Better to continue on as obese.(Thanks goodness that soon after reading this book, I found the low carb approach. One year later, I'm 50 pounds lighter, and I never eat noxious fake foods like low fat cream cheese. ..."
5,"Finally, a real weight loss book!","For years, false advertising has presented us with a number of fallacies on weight loss, though none can compare to the real thing. Dr. Kirschenbaum provides us with factual information in a refreshing and engaging way. Here is the Bible of weight loss. It's on the table, ladies and gentlemen. Give it a spin."
1,Horribly UNSAFE!!!,"I tried exactly what this book said to do; cut calories to about 800-1200 a day, work out EVERY DAY, and now after one week, I can barely walk; my muscles are getting sharp pains in them as are my joints.This guy never tells you that to get under 20g of fat a day you need to cut out almost all dairy, or that your body needs to rebuild muscle after excercise!Absolutely awful for your health, definate avoid!"
4,useful... but possibly outdated soon?,"Panther is shipping soon. With this in mind, this manual, based on Jaguar, may be slightly outdated. Not Pogue's fault, he is fantastic. But you might want to buy a manual written after 10.3 Panther comes out."
2,Disappointment,"First, this was supposed to be in new condition - it wasn't. Secondly, the book is really aimed at people upgrading from older Mac OS to OSX, not first time MAC users as I had expected."
4,"Sick of ""Help FIles""? Yes you are.","Apple simply doesn't include a manual with their computers. The whole ""Help"" thing is better than it used to be, but it is still a JOKE if you need real help with something complicated. David Pogue is not exaggerating with his title. You need this book, especially now that OS ten has landed, and taken over. Just get this book when you get your new apple and get it over with, you will save yourself a world of grief. Just do it!"
3,"Close, but not quite there... better books exist....","This book is well-done, but it doesn't target a specific audience. It has one foot in the beginner level and one foot in the intermediate level. It doesn't address either well enough.Also, the book's beginner level content lacks the depth required to make this book appropriate for someone who is completely new to the Mac OS, or computers in general.Great publisher. Great author. Average book....For a terrific beginner level book, go with Robin William's ""The Little Mac OS X Book."" For intermediate to advanced level content, with UNIX coverage, go with ""Mac OS X Unleashed,"" by John and William Ray. Both books cover OS X 10.1. Another book that may be good is Maria Langer's ""Mac OS X Advanced, Visual QuickPro Book."""
2,Incorrect information!,"Maybe everyone else thinks all of the information is wonderful, but I don't. Pogue doesn't seem to have the same Power Mac G4 OS X (10.1.4) with two hard drives that I do! His information on setting up and using email doesn't work on my computer. His information on how to send email document attachments from the Mac to a PC is incorrect: you cannot utilize .doc--nor am I able to send anything created in an Appleworks 6 document to any PC. There are many missing topics, and I don't care what the OS 9 had! He doesn't even note that some major videocams with still camera mode will NOT connect to Image Capture! If the easy tasks don't work the way he says they do, then I have no chance of ever learning Unix! Maybe he'd like to intercede with Steve Jobs about responding to HELP! letters? There are more problems with a Mac than with PCs...."
1,It was written on a Windows computer,The duplicitous David Pogue continues to make money off of poor Mac users while using Windows computers to get his work done.
2,Doesn't Answer Any Questions,"I used a Mac years ago, but I am new to the eMac and its systems. Not once have I been able to have my questions answered and/or problems solved by referring to this book.I tried to like this eMac and found myself working very hard to do so. But I am very sorry I bought this thing. The user has absolutely no access, let alone control, of the basic OS. Some users seem very happy about that; most don't know what I mean.I've used every type of computer and operating systems during my 30- year career, and I cannot see how the eMac ever became popular. But Mac users seem delighted with it, which hints of the nightmares they experienced using past versions of Mac OSs.Although I can only guess, it seems as though Mac users have never had system reference material before. And although the book has huge gaps in its coverage, for some reason it's being raved about as a great asset. After 2 months with this eMac, that doesn't surprise me."
2,Concise Oxford Dictionary of Quotations,"I am disapointed in this book. I love quotes and collect them. This seems to be quite ""stuffy'. have found very little of interest to me. Not my cup of tea. Will pass it on."
3,Cessna 172 Around Britain (From the Flightdeck 7),"A good number of pages and many B/W photos for the money. Kind of difficult to read though. No real story and a poor ending. Personally I liked ""from the flight deck #6"" much better."
3,Worth Reading,"William Maxwell's short novel is a snapshot of a quintessential American family living during an interesting time. At the first World War comes to an end, the Illinios community is also rocked by an influenza outbreak. But while I found the topic interesting, I also found the characters flat. The youngest son, Bunny, is by far the most developed. In contrast, the father remains more of a sketch. After finishing the book I appreciated the clean, sparse writing style of Maxwell's novel, but didn't much care about saying goodbye to these characters. It's not a book that will linger with me."
2,dissappointed,"After purchasing this item, I thought I had gotten a quality product. However, this does not toast evenly at all, only one side is toasted. The oven works fairly well. But the drip pan in the bottom rusted after cleaning up a very minor spill. I would have thought after spending this amount of money, this pan should have been stainless steel."
4,First-time toaster/convection oven owner,"The oven is handsome and sturdy. It comes with a really good quality broiling pan and drip tray. It heats up surprisingly fast, but doesn't heat up the entire room. It takes up little counter space and is easy to clean.I've made cookies, oatmeal bars, pumpkin pies, muffins, baked chicken and meatloaf so far. Food browns faster towards the back, so I just rotate the cookie pan or pies once (turn it so the back is at the front.) It doesn't matter when cooking meats.The rack tends to slide out when pulling out trays from the oven, so just be careful. There is the option for regular baking or convection baking. When using the convection option I reduce the time by 25%, although not using it is quieter.I've seen other ovens in retail stores that cost way less, but they look and feel more cheaply made. I'm pleased with my purchase."
4,"love it, but wish it was bigger","I am a daily user of this great little oven, it bakes faster than a convential toaster oven, and with precise temperatures.Baked potatoes take only 25-30 mins @ a high temp, saving energy and time, not to mention heat in the kitchen. The controls are easy to use, but entering data is slow. The major drawback is that the interior will not accomodate a 9x13"" pan; a size i use frequently. My last convection oven did, but then, it did not perform as well as this baby, and died an early death. Buy it, you'll love it!!"
1,Unusable - stinks horribly of toxins,"Lately, I have bought a fair number of products that have needed to be cleaned and aired out because of toxic smell. The problem seems to be getting worse in general. Made in China is highly correlated with the problem also.This Cuisinart toaster oven is in a new league however. It is by far the stinkiest product I have bought recently. It stinks of solvents and industrial chemicals in the most foul way. I suspect the internal non-stick coating is the culprit, but can't be sure. Given the level of stink, I found it unusable and returned it. In my experience, it would take weeks to air out and would need repeated bake offs of the smell.Since this produst is involved in food preparation, I consider it irreponsible to sell a product in this toxic condition."
4,A very good product which has made cooking for one a pleasure.,"I have had toaster ovens before. This one is the best. I toast, and use the convection oven often with great success. It is perefect for a single person who prefers not to use the large range. The only problem is that it is difficult to clean. But barbecued chicken thighs make all problems disappear!!"
4,Cuisinart TOB -175BC,Product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Toasting function is excellent with controls very easy to use and understand. Compact size fits our kitchen but use of the convection oven will be limited due to capacity.I highly recommend for quality and functionality.
5,More than for toasting,This is the best Toaster Oven I have ever owned...and I have owned at least 4 different brands. My main use has always been toasting...But this is truly a mini oven as well. I highly recommend this item.
4,Still works - amazing,Bought this 6 years ago and it still works just fine. I give it a 4 becasuse when you open the door bread crumbs fall onto the counter. A picky light review.
2,Toaster Oven Great - Warranty NOT,"The Oven itself works like a dream. It toasts, bakes, broils beautifully. However the boiler pans rusted in my dishwasher and cuisinart will only replace one of them and I have to purchase the other pan for $17. Did I just spend over $150 to be told that I am out of luck on a part that should still be under warranty. If I purchased locally I would be returning it to the store and exhanging it."
1,glass exploded after three years of light use,"I bought this unit in November 2005. I thought I would use the oven features often, but it just hasn't worked out that way. I mainly use this for toast on the weekends. I haven't been unhappy with it, but for just toast I could have spent a lot less than 200 dollars. Last weekend, my husband made toast it it, and when he opened the glass door, it shattered into a million pieces. It sounded like an explosion!! On the plus side, cuisinart customer service seems reasonable. They are sending me a new unit, but I have to pay shipping and handling to send the broken one back. Also, the warranty is only three years from date of manufacture, unless you can prove the exact date you bought it. Thank God that Amazon saves your orders so I did have proof of when I bought it. Who saves receipts for three years???? I'm kinda wondering why I would want another of the same unit that exploded on me in less than three years of light use, though."
4,"So far, so good","I bought this toaster oven to get us through a kitchen remodel. It has become my main oven over the past 3 weeks. So far, this toaster oven has done what it needs to do. Cooking frozen cinnamon rolls didn't work too well; the rolls don't rise like in my range oven. Haven't tried the toaster feature. Broiler is nice. Cleans easily. Unit does get very hot to touch, so don't store things on top and warn the kids (and husband). If you have more than 2 kids and are planning to use this often, I might buy a larger model. Consumer Reports rates this oven as a good buy; and I agree. I wouldn't like to cook here forever, but it has been well worth the money for what I need it to do."
2,Toaster oven that can't toast,"So, after having a cheap Black and Decker toaster oven for years, we decided to be more grown up and get a new, fantastically expensive toaster oven. This was it. Problem is, no matter where we place the rack, we can't seem to toast the bread evenly. If the rack is at the bottom, it produces burnt toast on one side, and no toast on the top. In Position ""B,"" it toasts the top and not the bottom. We found, however, that this is great for cooking frozen foods (like fish sticks), but sucks as a toaster. We had to go out and buy one of the old school toasters by Oster to suit our bread toasting needs. What a shame. It looks so pretty and grown up on our countertop. If you like making complex meals in a toaster oven, this might be a great buy for you. If you secretly want a nice product that you'll just use for its toasting capabilites, save your money and get a $20 toaster or toaster oven. This one won't work for you."
5,Cuisinart TOB-175BC Convection Toaster Oven,"We have had this toaster for a very short time; it has quality appearance and works very well. The glass door closes shut in a precise manner,in contrast to our previous,cheaper toaster oven."
1,"Cuisinart TOB-175BC Convection Toaster Oven/Broiler, Brushed Chrome","I purchased and returned 2 of the latest modelC 350 Cuisinart Convection Toaster Oven.It looks exactly the same as the TOB-175BC.It does not toast bread on the underside.If you want this oven as a toaster too, it doesnt work well.My $10 Proctor Silex toasts bread better."
1,Do yourself a favor,"If you are looking for a high end toaster oven, this is not it. Cheap plastic just like B&D. After 2 months, it looks like a truck ran over it. For this price, I would give it -5 stars."
4,Good Performer/Small Scale,"I have no complaints about the modern, well designed Toaster Oven, other than it is a bit smaller than I had hoped. But it takes up relatively little counter space and has done everything from toast to potatoes very well."
5,Positives greatly out weigh negatives,"Everyone who has written a positive reviewed has it right.I find only 2 draw backs:1. The crumb tray removal to the rear, but this is offset by the controls up front and center where they are needed.2. The lack of auto shut off, this is more troublesome but forewarned if forearmed.I owned a KRUPS oven for 4 years and find this one superior all the way around. I would buy it again and recommend it to everyone who needs an all around oven in a small kitchen. BTW: For toasted whole grain bread: 4 slices at setting 6 for lightly toasted and setting 7 if you want extra crunch."
5,"Versitle, works well, looks good",We bought this Cuisinart because of the reviews and they were right. I love the way it makes toast with the low heat first to get the bread warm then the high heat to brown it. It also does a good job of heating up left overs and even will cook modest sized items. I found it easy to use and so far has worked flawlessly. To top it off it looks good on our counter.
5,finally a decent toaster oven,"for anyone who has to buy a toaster oven every couple of years because what is available at traditional store fronts are worthless, i feel i finally found one that is well built and that will last. of course, it's new so i don't know the reliability yet but judging by what i've bought in the past and compared to the construction of the cuisinart, i feel it's going to be a better oven. even though it has lots of features, it's easy to use, has tremendous capacity, doesn't ugly up the countertop and is easy to clean. ordering from amazon was great and received it as promised."
1,Timer wouldn't control oven. Only acts as a timer.,"On my oven, when the timer timed out a weak, very high-pitched alarm began continuously beeping, but the oven remained ON until I manually pressed the STOP switch. I got mixed messages from Cuisinart, but Amazon.com Customer Service considered this a defect and graciously made the return process painless."
2,Pretty Poison,"I have another burned finger this morning from the Cuisinart. Something about the design of the door handle and the metal around the edge of the glass door results in nasty burns. Unfortunately, no matter how careful we are, this occurs. It's a beautiful toaster oven with lots of functionality, but this safety issue is more than we can bear. I am sending it back. Perhaps they should field test these things before they release them to consumers. Just a thought."
2,Great Oven! Lame Price!!,"I have had this Cuisinart for about a year and it is a great oven - good convection feature, reliable touch/digital controls, and fine looking in black/chrome. Compared to other consumer convection ovens it stands head and shoulders above (admitedly the competition generally sucks). Actually I would give it four and a half stars only because it has no internal light. BUT, when you can get this same black/chrome model for just under $100 at your local ClubCo (sic) warehouse, how can Amazon justify this price??"
4,Great oven,It works great. Toasts bread just perfectly. I've baked potatoes in it because I don't want to use the big oven to just bake 2 potatoes. One thing I wished they had was a pull out tray for crumbs.
5,My favorite appliance,"I've had this product for over a year and still love it. It provides enough oven space to cook for two and has virtually eliminated the need for me to heat up the ""big oven"" in my kitchen. Using it with a cooking stone (the Bar Stone from Pampered Chef) creates the perfect combination for meats, bread, cookies etc. I like mine so much I bought one for my daughter & family."
5,Helpful kitchen item,"I bought this to replace the basic model that I've had for about 6 years that suddenly died. I think the convection feature is very nice since that is an upgrade for me and it seems to speed up meal preparation significantly.I'm not crazy about the crumb tray being removed from the back but I wouldn't let it keep me from purchasing the item.Toasting is similar to the prior item and is basically OK but not as good as a stand-alone toaster. I do like the electronic controls compared to the more basic model with dials.For further information, Cook's Illustrated rated toaster ovens this month in their magazine. This one is ""recommended with reservations"" The Krups FBC412 is supposed to be better but I had already purchased this one. It is slightly more expensive but is supposed to toast better."
3,digital display failed,"Hi,Yes, this appliance is totally amazing. I used it quite regularly for the several years I owned it. If it weren't for the failure of the lcd digital control buttons, I would still have it. Unfortunately it failed causing me to have to replace it. I am now inclined to look for a brand with the same features but manual controls. It was a huge investment, and if the lifespan is no longer than a low/average priced unit, then I don't see the incentive to repurchase it again."
2,Cuisinart TOB-175 BC Toaster Oven,It didn't work for toast at all. It only toasted one side. I don't know if the one we purchased was defective or if they all are like that. We returned it.
4,Fast Ed,"Since I am single, live in an apartment and work long hours, I was looking for an appliance that would bake and broil small portions quickly.I have not used my full sized oven since purchasing this unit.It's perfect for baked chicken, broiled steak or small vegetable dishes. The temperature settings are accurate and the convection is a real plus when you need it.I do not toast or bake breads but I am sure this unit would be do the job well.If there is a negative, it's a small one. The interior and broiler pan are not that easy to clean and requires cleaning after every use.Amazon.com provided it's usual perfect shipping so I would not hesitate to recommend this Cusisinart product from them."
4,Great baked potato,"Use it for baking potato's, cooking specialty breads, and bagels.Works great and beats heating up the gas oven for baking small items."
1,"Total Piece of ""Crap"".... do not purchase.",I bought this product.... and yes it does many of the right things.... but there are so many wrong things about this particular item. I have ruined many a dinner.... because the rack inside is not secure and it falls out easily. Thanks a lot you miserable fricking designers for this wonderful feature. Just tonight.... trying my best to get dinner on the table was disappointed by the flaw that sent all of the asparagus to the floor. Lovely... why don't we have the designers of this oven come and mop my floor now. Anyway... whatever....... It's mine now... and it will live it's life out with me gingerly going about making dinner. NOT WORTH THE MONEY! Buy something else. Dissatisfied beyond belief at this point.... Mis L.
2,A disappointment,"Purchased and returned two of these because I couldn't get one that worked according to the user's instructions. The unit(s) I received would not signal by bell, tone, buzzer or whatever that the oven had reached the set temperature, or that the toast was done or the timer had counted down! That problem, at least to me, rendered the product useless."
1,Beware,"I have had two of these. The first one started falling apart then the 2nd one quit working. I have no idea why I ordered the 2nd one, but don't get fooled by this oven. It works great for about a year then it doesn't work at all."
4,Versatile and efficient,"We like this toaster oven because it's compact, it does lots of things, and (after a couple of tries) we find it easy to use. It seems to toast quicker on one side than the other, and there are only two heights for the oven rack, but mostly it does the job well. Convection saves energy. It's big enough for a 9x9 or 8x11 inch cake pan. We recommend it."
4,Great at broiling,"This is a little smaller than I would have preferred however, it's broiling ability compensates for that. I've had several different brands of toaster/broiler ovens and this is the first one to truly broil a steak in a yuumy manner!"
2,Toasts unevenly after a year,"I have had my Cuisinart toaster oven for about a year and a half. At first it worked great, and I was delighted. Now when I toast bread, it's done on top and extremely light on the bottom. When I enter ""cuisinart repair"" in Google, I get mainly negative comments, not the Cuisinart web site. It seems that I would have to mail the product to New Jersey and pay the cost of the return postage as well. Why not save up for a better product eventually?"
5,5 Yeras of Use,"I went digging back through my past orders to find this. This is hands down the best purchase I've made from Amazon or any online retailer. I'm not sure the reasons I bought it in the first place but I'm sure that I didn't expect to get the use out of it as much as our family does. It is used daily in our home, multiple times, again and again. I think the only time we ever turn the big oven on is for a big pizza, muffins, or a cake maybe. Everything else gets cooked in this great little oven. I really do hate to see that it is no longer being made. I fear one day ours will stop working and I would definitely be replacing it with the same if I could."
5,Better than your stove oven,This toaster oven bake potatoes well even sweet potatoes. It does cookies well (just adjust the oven temp). Now I can control how many I will eat!! With the stove oven I was making more cookies and well that meant more on the hips. I even like Jeno's pizza roll better than the stove oven. If you are looking for something to make things in a smaller portion so you don't have to turn on the stove oven. This is the item for you!!! It heats up a whole lot faster. This toaster oven does have a digital reading in degrees. I have baked at 450.
5,"Digital controls, convection, and lots of volume!","The above three points sold me on this toaster oven. My older toaster oven had analog (dial) controls, and I didn't really know whether I had turned the unit off after using it. The only way that I knew for sure was to unplug the oven before leaving my home. The digital readout on the Cuisinart allays this paranoia of mine :) .Convection helps to cook my food evenly, instead of just the side facing the heating elements, and I can fit a whole chicken into the thing. This oven was a great investment for our kitchen!"
3,"terrible for toast, great for baking!!","At first, I was confused about whether or not to buy this product. I read the two comments from Amazon: one said it was great for baking, the other said to not buy this if I was interested in toast. I bought this item and found out that both reviews were correct. This oven is terrible for toast: it cooks only one side of the bread. But, it is terrific for baking anything, especially fish. It even works better than my conventional oven (remember, only for baking purposes). If you want to bake, buy this. If you want toast, do not buy this--get a toaster!!!"
4,Worked Better than I expected,"This item worked better than any toaster oven I have owned in the past and I have owned about 10. The cheap ones worked OK but this one with its convention oven capabilities made baking cookies and crispy baked chicken better than the regular baking method. If you are single and like your food to cook evenly you should consider this.The bad thing about this is that it does not toast bread well either sliced or loaf, but when did you ever found something that toasted bread well. Also it was hard to take the drip pan out to clean. These two factors should not prevent you from trying out this small convection.I highly recommend this item if you just need to bake or toast items for a single person."
5,moorsun1020,I love this toast/convection oven. The size is great. It is big enough to bake a dinner for two people instead of wasting energy using the oven. Everything is cooked perfectly. It a little bigger than a regular toaster but for all the features it has definitely worth the space. It is a little pricey compared to a regular toaster oven but i think it will pay for itself in energy savings. I picked this particular model because of the dimensions. I wanted a convection oven but didn't want to lose the counter space as many of these ovens are almost as big as a microwave. I am very happy with all the features and would highly recommend this toaster oven.
4,cuisinart convection toaster oven broiler,"very satisified with this product..it is well constructed,priced right and versital.has all the features i need,cooks just about any thing and iseasy to use..it saves me turning on a hot oven in hot houston texas..."
5,Great toaster oven!,"Cuisinart TOB-175BC Convection Toaster Oven/Broiler, Brushed ChromeThis oven is used most every day, and has proved to be a solid performer. As time passed, I have used pretty much all of the functions of the oven, and learned to customize settings. I have not had a single problem with the oven since the day it arrived."
1,cuisinart failure,"I purchased this item with great expectations. It was defective, or maybe toast is supposed to brown on an intermittant basis. Also, it is too small. They say you can put up to 6 slices of toast in the oven, but it is IMPOSSIBLE. Frozen pizza would also not fit. All in all, this product is NOT worth the expense."
3,I expected more for the money,"I bought this after reading a lot of reviews. Frankly, I am disappointed. It does not toast evenly, and my daughter's much cheaper convection/toaster oven does as good a job. I think hers is an Oster, but I am not positive. If I had it to do over again, I'd get the one my daughter has."
2,Average performance/shoddy quality,"For a toaster oven/broiler at this price point, one expects exceptional performance and quality. After using it twice, the handle came right off! I haven't even bothered to glue it back on. I would return it but it's just a hassle. Its performance is also mediocre. The one plus is that I don't have to use my big oven for small jobs (like roasting some asparagus). I was also supposed to get a $50 e-certificate for the purchase of this Cuisinart product good towards a future Amazon purchase. I haven't received that either..and it's been almost 3 months since my purchase!"
5,Best toaster Oven,"I am extremely satisfied with this toaster oven. I bought it because I just moved into a new apartment, and the oven is very old. I like to bake, so I wanted to buy a sturdy, small oven that would be up to the challenge. Sure, this Cuisinart oven costs more than some of the other makes and models I was looking at, but it was worth the extra money. It is a truly beautiful appliance--very sleek, modern, and sturdy. It toasts quickly and evenly--the bagels are absolutely perfect, and they were ready in about 3 minutes! It's large on the inside--I was even able to bake a 9 inch pie. Everything comes out perfect in this oven. This oven is worth the extra money. I highly recommend it."
2,Wide but False Knowledge,"I am afraid that Jeanne will not like my writing about the best work of her life, but as her dictionary reached practically every western library and many universities, I only want to warn students, lecturers and researchers that almost all information contained in this volume is false. Unfortunately, Jeanne's personal archive is based either on the clippings from the Soviet newspapers, or on the minutes of her personal meetings with many of her ""heros"", like, for example, Kim Philby, who under no circumstances was inclined or authorized to tell the truth. Same concerns Agabekov, Manevich, and others, information about whom was taken from the Soviet sources. So from a seemingly objective account of peoples and events, one gets a deteriorated picture. I have checked most of the entries and all contained grave mistakes and incorrections. I am sorry, Jeanne! Readers be aware."
4,PETER GABRIEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The biggest problem, maybe the only problem, is that Peter Gabriel didn't close out this show with the best performance I have ever seen: BIKO- his performance, the choir, the content of the song, the crowd singing the song, the cause, it was completly in unison and I honestly think it is the best performance I have ever seen. Though I remember first seeing it on TV and seeing gabriel put the mike down on the stage but they don't show it on the DVD."
3,It''s okay,"Love the guy and the thought behind this, but the music is just okay. Would not recommend or purchase again."
3,"Enjoyable, but..","I would have to say that to-date, this is my least favorite of the films made based on Catherine Cookson's books. I think this film would have been greatly improved if it were an hour or so longer. The film feels rushed. We are not given the opportunity to get to know the characters very well.I much prefered The Dwelling Place and The Black Candle."
3,Dark Period Drama,"An impoverished young widow enters into service as a maid to a creepy old pederast in his mansion in England. After the pederast makes improper advances to her son, he blackmails her into staying in the house, and preventing her from marrying her commoner boyfriend. The second half involves the daughter of the young widow, who must enter into service after their employer dies.This was a very strange story, very dark and deep. I admit I didn't care that much for the first half since the master was a creepy guy, and I felt bad for the poor widow. The romance wasn't very strong. I did like the second half involving Biddy and her troubles as a servant.I'd give this 3 stars. It wasn't my favorite, and the subject matter was a tad dark for my taste."
1,Snooze fest.,"This was a waste of time. If I wanted to watch something that would put me in the mood to sleep; I would select this DVD. None of the characters were likeable or admirable. The story line was tragic, but I didn't really care about any of the characters enough to feel any empathy for their circumstance. Save your money."
2,strange story,A very strange story but with a happy ending. Not one of the best ones that I have ordered.
2,depressing,"I was looking forward to reading this book and getting motivated to start an exercise program. However, the front section of the book is so DEPRESSING, going on and on about health stats that I put the book down and have not been able to read further.Seriously, everyone knows how bad it is, do we have to go on and on about it?This is no way to motivate people to take action. The stick does not work."
2,This book was a disappointment,"I was looking for a book that would help get me motivated and psyched up to start walking, and this was definitely not it!The author seemed to be more interested in trying to convince his audience that walking was an as good or better exercise than running, than in presenting helpful information for those already interested in walking. I got very bored with reading about ""walking gaits"" and ""running gaits"" and gave up trying to finish the book."
1,Very Unhappy,I ordered this cologne for my boyfriend for Christmas from Whole Perfumes Inc. 2 weeks later i get an email from amazon stating my transaction was canceled with no explanation as to why. When i went back to the item on amazon it was still in stock but the price had gone up almost $20. As far as im concerned if the product is in stock there should be no problem. So now i have to go find this cologne in stores because its too late to have it shipped in time for christmas. Im very irate and i urge anyone who considers buying from them to shop elsewhere. There are plenty of wholesale perfume businesses online with better business tactics than this one.
2,This book is rather disappointing.,"There aren't a lot of rowing books out there, so this one was eagerly awaited. I wish I could say the wait was worth it, but it really wasn't. There is not much here of interest to a rower with any experience at all; Steve Redgrave's similar book, ""The Complete Book Of Rowing,"" is much more interesting and useful.David Lynch"
2,any ideas?,"Like an idiot I purchased this pan after wrestling with the 6 & 8 qt stockpots.I thought that if the pan was newer, the coating would come off easier. Nope. Cuisinart won't help you out either. LOUSY customer service.If anyone has luck with removing the protective coating please let me know.Its too late to return this prima donna, buy Calphalon instead!"
5,One of the Best of it's Kind,"I am a psychologist with over twenty years experience. I find that many clients have disregarded their intuition--to their ultimate dismay in their personal relationships--and have to learn how to better develop and trust their instincts. Dr. Lauren's book is well thought out and contains insights I did not find in other similar books. When my clients ask for help with developing their intuition, I always recommend this book first.Dr. Paul Coleman, author of ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Intimacy"""
3,Could be half the size and half the price,"Although there is a lot of valuable advice in this book, I found the fluffy writing tiresome, and I didn't need many pages of another drawn out history of the development of the internet since its inception by the government. You can find better presented, and more equally valuable advice (including more technical details) in other excellent books, especially Robin William's Web Design Workshop and Non-Designer's Web Book."
5,great reference text,"I teach an interactive design course at the University of the Arts, and I listed this book as a recommended text in the syllabus. It is an all encompassing, clear, concise view of the past, present, and future of the web. On top of that, Zeldman's writing is very witty, never boring!"
3,Danzig's Comics Are Cool,"Glenn Danzig's adult comics are actually pretty cool. This issue is from Satanika, one of their most popular and well known titles. Has Satanika fighting Igrat. A lot of nudity. Surprisingly cool."
3,Exercise Discernment and Caution,"My first comment is that I would urge readers to exercise discernment and caution with this subject matter in general. As a shamanic counselor who has worked with survivors of ritual abuse (and ritual sex abuse) the domain of the subject of this book is ripe for abuse and misinterpretation. While the author does offer some interesting information, does offer due diligence to things like health safety, and does seem to have a grasp of the advanced energy mechanics of tantric practices, etc., I think this work could have received much more care in its presentation and I also feel that more could have been written about the nature of responsibility and ethics in ritual work."
1,Examples do not work,I purchased this book and downloaded the sample code from O'reilly. I then applied the errata from the o'reilly site.The first example does not work in either netscape communicator 4.72 or ie 5.0. It is full of script errors. This really irritates me. I don't mind doing a little debugging but this is ridiculous.
2,Disappointed,"I too expected something modeled after The Perl Cookbook, which provides coded solutions to common problems. While the JavaScript Application Cookbook (""Application"" wasn't in the title when I preordered it!) does show the power of JavaScript as a programming language, it is not, in my view, nearly as useful as The Perl Cookbook, so if that's what you were looking for, you'll probably be disappointed as well."
3,"Not bad, but not what I wanted.","I thought this book would be the Javascript equivalent of the Perl Cookbook, but not even close. This book just doesn't serve the same purpose. It's not a bad book, but it needs to be simplified into categories. Us programmers don't need to have our hands held while we code stuff, we just need help here and there and that's what made the Perl Cookbook so good. This book just describes whole projects. Screw that.Believe it or not, I think JavaScript for Dummies is still king for a reference when being stuck on something. Either that or rack your own brain and solve it yourself. :-)"
4,Good .. at being what it is,"I must say I don't understand some of you saying this book isn't what you hoped for - you certainly didn't know what you were buying. As for being an ""application cookbook"" this book does what it's supposed to do and does it well.The application examples include an online test system, a slideshow/image viewer and something I found very useful, a cookie based shopping cart. Even if there isn't really a wide variety of different examples, those provided are advanced enough to show the capabilities of JavaScript at a high level, and gave me ideas on other things I could program myself, using the examples as guidelines while moving along..My impression of the code in the book is that it is clean and hi-qual, it works w/o glitches in 4.x gen browser, which really are what you should be developing for these days.Only gripe is the price.. a little too much maybe.. but I guess I could live with that after saving alot of work cop.. *cough* .. learning from the code in the book :)"
3,Strange review,"The prior reviewer didn't review the book so much as Javascript itself. While I can appreciate that he/she likes Perl better, saying that while reviewing a Javascript book is silly.This is a decent book, on the order of the Perl Cookbook. 'Nuff said."
5,Fantastic book on all the states!,"This book is fantastic! My son is 6 and has checked it out of the school library twice. I was so thankful to find it at such a bargain on Amazon! It arrived quickly, is in mint condition, and is jam-packed full of lots of great information about all the states. Colors and pictures are on every page as well as lots of details, so I know my son will appreciate and learn from this book for many years to come."
1,DO NOT waste your money,This book is purely theory. There is nothing that can actually be used in real life applications.
2,Not to the point and content does not match chapter title,"Book is full of diagrams only the author could understand. Author does have some good insight(not technical) on building a good site.That will be the only reason for reading this book. But he could probably cover that in a pamphlet instead of a book if he exercise self constraint with writing metaphors. Basically the technical side is very limited and outdated, and does not offer good advice due to subjectiveness. Also the book has too much unnecessary writings equivalent to verbal mumbling. One simple point could take up a whole page. Waste of reader's time. Author does not know his target audience. Some parts of the book are so basic that it belongs to the FOR DUMMY series, but others are very technical and author did not offer any briefing."
1,Don't waste time and money on this book,This is a book full of fluff. Not practical at all in today's ecommerce world! Some high-score reviewing to this title is really misleading.
1,Not helpful at all,This book provides no technical information needed to build a cyberstore. It might be useful to those who need an dated overview of e-commerce.
1,Do NOT get this book!,"Whatever you do, don't buy this one. Believe me, it isn't worth it. I bought it, read through some of it, and returned it. If you are looking for how to design and program a site like Amazon.com, this is NOT the book to get. All fluff, no real information...and some parts are outdated and confusing. Buy something you will actually read and understand....and this book is not it!"
3,Loaded with information but crippled by a bad index.,"This book is an exhaustive, 500-page tome on Internet commerce, and it seems to contain information on almost any conceivable facet of the subject. However, it's crippled by having a wholly insufficient index--a mere 12 pages of sporadic and incomplete references to the thousands of concepts, facts, data, and companies mentioned in the book. A reader interested in ISPs, for example, may find a few glancing references to them in the index, but find a much fuller treatment of them on pages not mentioned in the index. This renders the book far less useful than it should be, especially as no reader is going to sit down and dutifully read all 500 pages in order. This is a book that should cater to the ""surgical strike"" reader, but its index makes this impossible. Very frustrating!!!"
2,Just another fluff-filled tome,"I bought this book hoping it would live up to some of its promises, and really give a detailed look a EDI or POS integration or transactions or tying into existing accounting systems (all bullet points on the back cover). I'll be returning it tomorrow because it failed to fulfill any of them. I was able to blast through this 500 page book in a single sitting because there wasn't a single new concept or piece of information to slow my reading...This would probably be a good intro to ecommerce for a novitiate, but it's a waste of time for anyone who's ever built a store before.As side-notes, 1) I was amazed that any ""tech-savvy"" book could repeatedly mis-spell ""embed"" as ""imbed"" and 2) this book could have been dramatically improved by restructuring grouping of the information, and breaking long, winding chapters into more insightful, tight, shorter chapters."
4,Son's teacher loved it.,My son's preschool teacher thoroughly enjoyed this item that we gave him for a Christmas gift. Item seems pretty durable.
2,Not the same as picture,"When my package came in it was not the same as in the picture. Kinda disappointed, but kept the one I got because if I would have went through the hassle to send it back, I wouldn't have had the mug in time for my boyfriends birthday"
5,Satisfied customer,The book I ordered for a Christmas gift was received on time and was in perfect shape.
4,it helps unwind you after a long day at work,Tis is an excellent product. It helps relax you. I feel more awake in the morning after using it as i sleep well. I would definetly recommend it to anyone who feels stressed out and wants to just relax.
4,A beautiful book about beautiful weddings.,"Other reviewers have said that this book has serious problems given that some of the weddings featured ended in divorce or other tragedy. While it's true that one can't help but to think about those things while reading this book, the book is about WEDDINGS, not marriages, and as such, I found it to be beautiful. The book features brides throughout the ages, starting with Queen Victoria and moving on to Carolyn Bessette Kennedy. The author describes the overwhelming love felt by each of these brides at the time of their marriages and highlights the most romantic details of their weddings. In addition, she offers suggestions (under the heading ""Something Borrowed"") on how to adapt some of the wedding traditions used by these brides in order to incorporate them into a modern wedding. Overall, this book is gorgeous to look at, and while some of the stories had sad endings, the book itself is joyous."
5,Wonderful Book,I love this book. I am a wedding planner and it is very inspirational. Actually my very own wedding dress is featured in the book. I highly recommend it.
3,Interesting survey of contemporary works,"The best thing about this anthology compiled by Robert L. Mclaughlin is the broad and obscure selection of stories. They're not all good, but they paint a decent picture of the broadness of postmodernist fiction. Despite the punctuational confusion of John Barth's 'Menelaiad' and John Edgar Wideman's utterly awful 'Surfiction', there are several rather interesting and original pieces. Felipe Alfau's 'A Character' takes a dive into meta-fiction, Robert Coover's 'You Must Remember This' takes an ingenious and decidedly vulgar approach to Casablanca, and Donald Barthelme's 'The Balloon' uses magical realism to tell a rather sweet story. There's even a little Gertrude Stein ditty. All in all, despite its uneveness, creative writers looking for more unconventional approaches or people just interested in postmodernist short fiction should find this anthology helpful and interesting."
3,"Uneven, but Coover's worth it","I'll admit it: I've never _really_ read any of the other stories in this book (although a young David Foster Wallace is worth a peek) because I bought it for Robert Coover's mercilessly hot ""You Must Remember This."" I read it when I was fourteen and all I can say is MPAA censors and any other controls on sex in the media be damned: this was what made me look forward to having an ""adult experience."" (Whether or not we ever become adults isn't really relevant in an amazon.com review.)""You Must Remember This"" is breathless and fantastic and is beloved because it's sex equal parts funny and sad--the way it is. You probably heard that one before."
5,If 6 Stars * * * * * * Were Possible,"If you use Flash Actionscript for anything serious, this is THE book to buy. This book covers topics in-serious-depth, that other books only graze, or worse, neglect to cover at all. Not just a collection of ""tips and tricks"", but more like a comprehensive guide that will allow you to come up with ""tips and tricks"" all on your own. One of the best programming books I have ever read."
5,Ripped Script,"This book absolutley blows the competition away. Finally an actionscript reference that doesn't humiliate, abuse and frustrate me. It took an artist to speak in a manner that us right brainers could absorb without getting sweaty migraines. I feel initiated and empowered. Now I can join the party all the code primates have been enjoying. Colin is lead dude of the digital renaissance."
3,"Useful for some, and useless for others","As a web coder, I write in JavaScript fairly often. Given that ActionScript and JavaScript have the same background, moving from one to the other should have been a snap, but it isn't and a good book to help the experienced coder get into Flash and ActionScript is a necessary evil. I thought this book would be the key.The first half of the book goes into excellent detail about the usage of different loops and variable naming techniques etc. Coding basics. This isn't what I had in mind. The target of this book is more for the Flash Graphical Designer who knows little or no code, but wants to add functionality to their art. I was looking for something to add art to my functionality :).I won't tell you not to get it, but I will tell you that you should define your position and what you are looking to accomplish when buying a guide. I just learned that the hard way."
3,I'm not sure,"As much as I respect Mr Moock and his work I have to say I found this book not very accessable from a designers point of view. I don't claim to be a techie but I wanted to get to grips with and understand actionscript and I knew Colin had a fantastic reputation amongst Flashers so I bought the book. I am sure that sooner or later it will click and I will understand things more but I just wish there where a few more practical examples with step by step tutorials. But like I said I'm a designer not a techie so I suggest you buy this book if you have a good understanding of functions and arrays and such, but if you want a more practical and visual approach to learning actionscript I would recommend Foundation Actionscript. Sorry Colin."
4,Good ActionScript reference book,"It's all good... lot's of info, examples, details, etc etc...I do have to comment though that everything you find in this book is EASILY found and sometimes in a way more deep and detailed manner in the Macromedia Flash Help section and in www.macromedia.com Flash support section... I would not consider this an essential book even though one feels secure to have it close..."
3,Boring to read ... but good as a reference,"I'm a programmer and I found this book very boring (there are so few full examples). However, it's very useful as a reference book. For learning ActionScript, I recommend Flash 5 ActionScript for Fun and Games."
5,Best Complete ActionScript Guide,"If your a novice and wants to learn ActionScript, then this is the book for you! The book explains everything single thing there is to know about sctionscripts! Once your finish you should understand what every single action does!"
3,Not suitable for experienced programmers,"Nice book, found it pretty pleasant at first, but it was too easy to digest (six, seven hours and you can toss it over your shoulder). The real answers I need (mostly dealing with movie clip behaviours) are only vaguely explained or absent and I found the book more of a frustration than otherwise from about 1 week onwards.Having said this, there doesn't appear to be any other title for Flash that caters to those whose programming knowledge exceeds their experience as a graphical design user."
5,"Its true, is the definitive guide!!!","this book is great, i just can't believe that it toke so long to me to find it, but now i have it... its a true 100% guide to everything in actionscript in flash 5, this guy teachs sooooo well that im allways motivated to keep reading, everything is clear, and with no hard complicated writing, im undestanding all, even when i never liked to program and stuff like that..."
3,"Good, not great","It cooks and toasts well, and very convenient for small baking/broling. Does not clean well - although it has a crumb tray, and the white paint is pealing off the front. It has become dark and burnt looking as a result - when I ordered the chrome was not available. Don't get white!"
5,It actually toasts,"Ease of use: Very easy to use. It does work differently from most other ovens/microwaves/etc, but I think that is a good thing.Toasting: Not as good as a dedicated toaster, but much better than any other toaster oven I have used. Unlike a toaster, it handles odd sized pieces of bread too.Baking: Does pretty well for potatoes, rolls, and frozen dinners.Broiling: It seems to take a while to get heated up, but works well after it does.I would have liked a separate baking tray included in addition to the wire tray. Overall, very nice. I think the unit in white is a better value than the stainless steel model."
5,Excellent product....,We love the Cuisinart Convection Toaster Oven/Broiler and use it every day...sure beats the old toaster we had. May be a little more expensive but worth every penny.
4,"Very good, but could be a bit better.","I did a lot of searching for toasters before buying this one, and am happy with the purchase.A few nits:The toast does not easily slide out because the metal bar around the wire toast rack is on top, not on bottom. So you have to lift up the hot toast to get it out. Ouch.The ""done"" beep is way too loud, and does not seem to be configurable.The controls could be simpler."
4,Almost perfect,"Works great. I would have given it 5 stars except I wish it were just a little bigger inside; a little higher. And I wish it would shut off when the timer reaches the end. I hate watching stuff to see when it's done.Makes excellent toast, cooks steak juicy with good control of heat, and cooks a cornish hen just perfect; juicy and tender.Overall, an excellent buy from Amazon, with excellent delivery."
3,Great product -- except for ...,"This is an excellent product except for two glaring problems. 1. One of the most important features of this oven is the timer feature. That was the deciding feature for us. Unfortunately, the timer fails to do the single most important feature of a timer attached to an oven -- it does NOT turn off the oven when the BAKING or BROILING time runs out!2. The manual recommends cleaning the top inner surface (heat reflector) of the oven after broiling or baking. Unfortunately, there is no practical means of doing this because the top inner reflector cannot be removed for cleaning and the upper heat elements are in the way of cleaning.In our opinion, these are both glaring design oversights in an otherwise good product."
4,Cuisinart convection toaster oven,"I quickly learned to ignore the rack positions recommended in the Cuisinart booklet. This oven does indeed make uneven toast - unless you adjust the rack to the lower position and turn it upside down [convex side up]. I have found the need to get creative with the rack for other baking uses also. Makes a great baked potato in 45 min., but muffins, convection baked according to a recipe in the booklet, were overbrowned in just a few minutes. Have been afraid to try other breads in such a small oven. I think some things can't handle close proximity to heating elements. A sweet little oven if you take some liberties with it. It CAN make great toast."
3,Cuisinart toaster oven,"This is a nice quality oven with sturdy components, but it has an annoying electric ""buzz"" the entire time it is plugged in. Kind of frustrating to unplug it every time we use it."
5,super,"this is the best item I have found for doing everything you would want a toaster oven to do. It heats/cooks food evenly, is easy to operate, and Cuisinarts customer service has been wonderful to do business with. I have owned one for 5 years, and have bought both my son and daughter the same unit for their new homes.It is a great value!"
5,countertop oven,"Just love this !! Perfect for reheating, baking etc. It has 3 settings- bake,convection bake and broil. The convection bake browns fast, really makes great french fries, frozen breaded fish, shrimp etc. really crispy and no added oil, do not use my deepfryer much any more. It browns very fast and you have to keep an eye on things or they will burn. Easy clean-up and the Amazon price is great. Saves a lot of money, my Viking Range eats natural gas so this is very economical for small items. And when we have company it comes in handy for extra things that need to be baked. Overall, a really good value for the money."
4,Two things could make this a better product,This is a good product but it would take so little to put in a light in the oven and to fix the timer to cut off .I do not understand a designer not doing this.(should have ask a few of us people who use these things what was missing)
5,Simple and Reliable,We found the Cuisinart TOB-165 Convection Toaster to be easy to use and reliable/consistent. The product has a greater toaster that allows you to vary the browness using electronic selector. The high schooler and college students of the family use it mostly for cooking frozen foods such as fish and chicken. Highly recommended.
4,Just what I needed.,"I mainly purchased this oven to make buttered toast without heating my large oven. It is so great, I have been cooking other things on it. It is a great size for a family of two. If one is cooking for more, a larger oven would be nice. One of the great features is you can set for broil, bake, convection oven, set temp and time and forget it. It will beep constantly when completed until it is tended.N. MarshallAlbertville, AL"
5,Absolutely superior product,"Although the Cuisinart TOB-165 Convection Oven is undoubtedly great for many applications, it is a most practical convenience for the single person. In the past few weeks this oven has become the major cooking device in my kitchen. It is not only very practical for cooking small quantities, it is also easy enough to clean that it encourages one to believe that cooking that thing is really a worthwhile enterprise."
5,I love it!,"I decided to buy a small convection oven after watching ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and deciding I needed to find ways to reduce the amount of electricity that I use. Why use the full size oven if all I want to do is bake a few mushrooms? This little oven has almost replaced my big oven. I can roast vegetables quickly in it, and even bake muffins. The room doesn't get as hot as when I use the big oven, though there is some heat that escapes the front door. It heats up super quickly and cleans easily, too. I'm very happy with this purchase."
5,Hands Down the Best Toaster Oven I have ever owned.,"I have bought and tossed quite a few toaster ovens over the last few years. They all shared the same problems. Difficult to use precisely, required constant watching and very uneven cooking. Since I was once again equipping my kitchen from scratch, I decided to do my research. I wanted something that I could use for anything from Bagels to reheating dinner or even cooking dinner. The Cuisinart has it all. It allows me to toast the bagels just the way I like them - just barely browned, at the same time allowing me to reheat anything from pizza to fried foods leftover from the diner. My girl was even able to bake bread in it. The oven heats quickly and maintains an even temperature. The convection option cooks faster and more evenly than traditional Toaster Ovens. Well worth every penny."
4,"Works great, just needs to shut off","This is a great product, I had read a lot of reviews before I purchased it. My only gripe is that it doesn't turn off when the timer goes off. Otherwise, it works much better than any other toaster oven I've had -- more like a real oven."
1,hARD TO CLEAN,"EVERYONE SEEMS TO LOVE THE THE TOASTER OVEN AND I THINK IT WORKS PRETTY GOOD, EXCEPT FOR CLEANING UNDER THE DOOR. HOW DO YOU DO IT ? I BROILED SOME PORK CHOPS AND THE GREASE HITS THE DOOR AND RUNS DOWN UNDER THE DOOR. THIS IS UNDERSTANDABLE, BUT IT IS ALMOST INPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN BETWEEN THE DOOR AND BODY OF THE MACHINE. I WOULD NEVER BUY ONE AGAIN BECAUSE OF THIS. TALKED WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY WERE VERY NASTY AND TOLD ME ALL OF BRANDS ARE THE SAME, IS THIS TRUE?"
1,Great product.................. horrible service,"This product worked great...for 3 weeks.When I needed it repaired Cuisinart couldn't or would not send out repair parts to my USA address.Nope. Send it back, at huge expense.To make matters worse you can't reply to their email, NO you have to go to their site and send an email by filling in the blanks.Compare this to Calphalon, Bosch or KitchenAid, all of which I have dealt with in the past 2 years and the message is clear. Don't buy a Cuisinart product if you expect service after the sale. Their competitors make comparable products and actually service their customers so it makes no sense to buy Cuisinart."
2,I've had this for a year and it cracked!!!,"The Cuisinart Covection Oven in all white cracked after about a year from very little use. It seemed to start getting hairline cracks in it after three months. Now that I've used the broil function more often, the top of this oven is cracking.I loved it, until it cracked."
1,beware chipping paint/metal,"Have had oven for two years. Now the metal/paint over the door is chipping off. Can't find the flecks so I guess it's either on the food or wiped away with the crumbs.Will get a new toaster oven but not a Cuisinart, they didn't even answer my questions. Reported to CPSC"
5,Marianne,"I bought this after reading tons of reviews. In short, I am delighted. We use it in my office. We take turns bringing things in and I prepare them. It sure smells good around here. I am amazed at how quiet and efficient it is. I use a spray on non-stick coating and the pans clean up wonderfully ! The controls are clear and easy. The only complaint is the same as if you were using a regular oven, in that it is a little tricky getting the pan out with the hot food without getting burned. Awkward. That said, I hope Cuisinart addresses this. Otherwise, I am just amazed and pleased."
4,"Great item, good performance","I am very pleased with this toaster oven. The only flaws that make it less than perfect is the fact that you have to enter the time by pressing the minute key once for every minute you want it to cook (will the key wear out from so much use?) and that it does not shut itself off when the time has run out. I am EXTREMELY pleased with how fast it heats up, which appeals to my energy conservation side as well as its convenience. The results are very good as far as how it does the various tasks, and I use it several times a day. I really like the 3-year guarantee; the cost of ownership is comparable to 3 years' worth of throwaway ovens that never perform well in the first place. I researched this one carefully and definitely feel I bought the right product for my needs."
4,THIS WOULD BE 5* IF IT HAD A LIGHT,THIS IS A GREAT ITEM ONLY PROBLEM I FIND IS IT DOESNT HAVE A INSIDE LIGHT SO YOU CANT SEE HOW BROWN STUFF GETS UNLESS YOU OPEN THE DOOR AND SLIDE THE TRAY OUT. OTHERWISE I LOVE THIS...
3,A great toaster but our handle broke off,"Love this toaster. We've had ours for years. But the white plastic handle broke and we cannot find a replacement for it anywhere. So now we have to throw out a perfectly good toaster oven because we can't open it. Also, I'm not sure why this price is so high. We got ours years ago for under $200. Definitely not worth the price listed here!"
2,Looks like a bomb exploded inside,"We purchased this model around 2004 or so. It performs it's cooking and timing chores very well, BUT you can tell how hot the exterior gets by the fact that a third of the paint has chipped on the face (sides are still OK), making it very hard to keep looking clean. Basically, it looks as though a roast exploded on the inside and face of the unit. We can't get it clean - and even if we could, it still looks really bad with all the paint cracks and chips missing.The convection fan has always been noisy. Definitely would not recommend to anyone because of the cosmetic appearance (unless you want to keep it in your basement or garage)."
3,Good product - but don't buy white,"This has been a great little unit for 3 years. However, after a few months, it gets discolored on the top over the door. After 2 years, the finish cracks and chips. I am looking to replace it because it's so unsightly. Too bad, because it still works very well."
3,Hummer of an oven,"Well, like many cuisinart products, this is the ""Hummer"" of a toaster-oven. While expensive and in pretty dress like a Hummer, it's just an ordinary chevy underneath. Read, ordinary $35 toaster oven.Controls are fancy, but not integrated. Toasting control is just a timer i.e., pressing buttons for darkness, bagel, frozen, etc. don't check brownness or moisture or anyother way of telling completion, it just resets the timer to something pre-determined. Thus you're just a likely to burn or undercook your breakfast as with any other toaster.cons:no interesting technologypoorly insulated.cheap constructionoverpriced by 3-foldpros:large size.seems to be accurate temp controlSadly, cuisinart is just another marketing company now, that is as likely to sell low quality as high. evaluate your purchase carefully."
5,Great toaster oven,"This is an absolutely great toaster oven. We had to replace our toaster about 5 months ago after only a year of use, so I decided to go with a toaster/oven combination. This toasts things absolutely perfectly. It's also great for heating stuff up in. I haven't completely mastered the convection part yet, but then again I've never used a convection oven before. I would definitely buy another one of these if this one ever dies."
4,"Good, Bad and Ugly (Okay it's not ugly)","The good is it is exactly what I had been looking for. I have never had a ""Toaster"" that worked well. This appliance does great.The bad is that the instructions are terrible. We had to figure out how the thing works by trial and error (not to difficult). Also, it is a pain to clean"
4,nice oven,I have been using this oven for a few years now. It works great and has never given me a problem. It heats up quick and cooks evenly and quickly. The only trouble is that it is hard to clean. As long as you dont mind an oven that has that lived in look it is a great buy.
2,"Not all its ""Cracked Up"" to be","We loved this product for over a year, and with the minor annoyance of the crumb tray being hard to access, it cooked well. The toasting could be crisper, but for cooking small ovens of food, we had been very happy. HOWEVER the paint began cracking above the door. This is not isolated, as my in-laws loved our oven and purchased one of their own. As they are older and only cook smaller meals, their use of the oven is even greater - theirs is really cracked, with paint curling up. I don't want the paint bits falling into my/my kids' food as it comes out the oven. It also looks terrible. We have relegated it to the basement, and are using a toaster only in the meantime. I have noticed superior toast since using a toaster. We hope another maker of toaster ovens comes out with a good convection toaster oven. I've been looking for a stainless one which will not burn my hand which also gets good reviews."
1,lousy temp control,"I bought the toaster oven and found the actual oven temp to be 50-75 degrees lower than the setting. I sent it back for repair ($15) and now the real oven temp is 70-75 lower than the setting. I use two oven thermometers, which I calibrate check in the built-in kitchen oven."
4,Basic ADA for cheap,"Works to get eight channels in for cheap. Preamps are just OK, quiet enough but need EQ and good mixing. The optical IO's are nice. Use good cables.Very poor packing however. One of the coaxial spdif output jacks pierced through the box and got bent to heck. There was no padding on three of the sides."
4,ADA8000 Almost OK,"I used the ADA8000 as an additional ADAT channel with my Korg D16XD Hard disk recording system, the ADA synch via wordclock at 16-bit/44.1 (Slaved) was flawless, but when I tried 24-bit 48.khz (Slave)I started getting the crackle so common with digital clocks... somehow there is really no way to trouble shoot it. I have not tried everything out, so my summary so far is that the ADA sounds like what signal you put in it, I like the amps knob controls. What it can't do.. is let the front signal input thru to the back output. The Manual is very short, and can't explain some situations one might need to know."
5,A Farmer Boy Birthday Review,"This story reflects the way a birthday boy growing up on a farm in the late 1800's might celebrate his birthday. The editor has done an excellent job of taking a short story from within Laura Ingalls Wilder's original book FARMER BOY and making it a short story for youngsters. The pictures are appealing and the story stays focused. I wish the publishers would print another edition of the book. All the stories we have read from the ""My First Little House Books"" have been thoroughly enjoyed by my family. We often give copies as gifts to other children and we borrow the copies we can't get from the library."
3,Rampage Shoes,"The shoes are nice, but I received them with some of the jewels missing in the buckles."
1,"Very bad product, poor customer service","This product did not work as it advertised. It did not remove even 1% of hair. When I contacted customer service to return product, because it did not work on me. They refuse to take it back and I am very upset on poor customer service. I would not recomend this product."
4,Epil Stop 'n Spray -- worked for me!,"After reading all the negative reviews, I wasn't expecting Epil Stop 'n Spray to be very effective. Boy, was I surprised.I did not have to spray it on multiple times to remove hair. One layer worked fine. I let it set in for about 10 minutes, applied a reasonable amount of pressure during the removal process and all the hair came off!Many people have reported that it burned or irritated their skin. Not so in my case. The only complaint I have is that the spray really does smell. But so does Nair. No big deal.This actually worked better than Nair and most of the hair removal products I've used.I don't know how effective the roll-on or wipes are, but after seeing how well the spray worked, I just might try those too."
2,Not worth the extra money,"I have been a loyal Cuisinart customer for some time now; this product is the first in which I have been disappointed. The pan has a great feel and has a solid, durable construction, but there are two problems. First, the pan is off balance - the heavy handle lifts the pan from being perfectly flush on my gas stove burner grate. Second, the handle gets very hot. One can not grab the handle with a bare hand; one must use a mit or pot holder. I am not saying it is a bad pan, only that it falls short of the quality that the price would indicate. I prefer the much cheaper Multi-clad Pro 10-inch skillet."
1,Maybe I'm doing this wrong,"Save your money! While attractive, this pot, like all the other Copper Classics, suffers from a poorly designed coating that refuses to come off.I've followed the ""soak in hot water w/baking soda"". I've tried scraping, first with a plastic knife, then with a chisel (out of desparation). NOthing. If you ignore removing this film, the pot stains UNDERNEATH the coating. Now you have discoloration with a armored coating protecting it!I've written to Cuisinart 5x in the past year. NO response.Get the Calphalon instead!"
1,Product is not working,"Do not buy this powder.I did the experiment: I placed few fleas in glass bottle with Hartz powder, three hours later they were still alive. I strongly recommend not to buy this product, otherwise you will have the smelly house for a weeks with thriving fleas in it."
1,doesnt work,Had new carpets put in after I flea bombed. Pets not aloowed inside. After new carpets I put this product one and let it sit for 5 hours then vaccumed hoping to prevent fleas from settling in. One week later I noticed fleas on my socks. Applied again and let sit over noght. Vaccumed next morning and still fleas jumping on my socks. It doesnt kill fleas even after 12 hours
1,Mediocre At Best,"I applied two containers of the powder to three rooms. Two are bedrooms about 12x10 feet, the other is a living/dining area roughly the combined size of the bedrooms. Plenty of powder as advertised on the label for the amount of space. After brushing it in and waiting the minimally required 60 minutes, I vacuumed the excess and let the dust continue to settle on everything. No less than a few hours later, the fleas were still jumping at my ankles, completely unaffected. A week goes by, same story.Save your money, go get something better."
5,Inexpensive Knowledge Repository,"A long time fan of O'Reilly books, the CD bookshelves are one of the best ideas I've seen from a publisher. If you don't mind reading onscreen these will save you money. If you do pick this up in addition to the hardcopy simply for the search capabilities. A great reference tool from any serious programmer."
3,Not as pictured,Does not look anything like this bright pretty red accented Bills mug in the photo...very disappointing black. I may return it
3,A Book with Stronger Research on Europe Than the Pacific,"Alas, yet again, more thorough research on Europe appears in this volume, as it does in most US publications. As the future probably belongs to China and India, the situation should be reversed. For a deeper look at the Pacific War - and MacArthur in particular - read ""I've Always Loved You"" by Ann Seymour"
1,A mishmash of a history book,"Mr. Martin does not seem to able to make up his mind whether he wants to write a military history of WWII or a political history of WWII or a history of the holocaust. Thus, while the book is packed with details and anecdotes due to the lack of a unifying theme it leaves anyone interested in any particular aspect of war completely unsatisfied."
5,Review for Secrets of the Vine,"I enjoy reading Secrets of the Vine by Bruce Wilkinson. The book does a goood job of explaining God's method in producing much fruit in the lives of His children. The book isn't too wordy, and the author does a good job of explaining everything in a teachable way.Secrets of the Vine (Leather Edition)"
1,This is NOT Russel Crowe's and Ridley Scott's Gladiator,You people have it wrong. This is not the recently released blockbuster hit 'Gladiator' starring Russel Crowe. That movie was directed by Ridley Scott.
2,This is not GLADIATOR described below.,"Look at date of this film. It was produced in 1938 and not 2000 or 1999. This has nothing to do with the modern film the only thing they have in common is the title, folks. BTW, see the modern film. GLADIATORS is great. Hope it comes DVD soon."
2,Too Over the Top,I bought this book because of Amiaya Entertainmentbackground. This book was horrible. The story line was so unbelieveable and the dramatic killings could have been left out. I think this author is incarcerated and he has too much time on his hands. This book was so unbelieveable and there was not a main focus on the characters. I would not request anyone to purchase this book.
5,I liked it,"I liked it it was urban from the beginning to the end and that's why I liked it. Just handed it to my sister she wanted to read it. Read it in 2 days. All the killing these girls was cold but, they got revenge.:)"
1,Where's the Beef???,"This book spends 300 pages dancing around the topic of change management and talking about the authors' proprietary change management system of tools/checklists. The authors go to great length, over and over again, to list all the tools they have available, yet nowhere in the book or on the CD-ROM will you find ANY example of these tools! For that, you need to go to their website and spend thousands more.What a complete waste of time and money sifting through all the fluff in this book trying to find some concrete, practical tips on a subject that sorely needs to be covered well. You won't find anything redeeming about Project Change Management in this book."
2,"Overpriced, tiny, and not very pink","We bought this item as a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law, who recently underwent breast cancer treatment (and has now been given a clean bill of health). We were disappointed in the pendant's small size and general lack of bling. The chain is also quite delicate (translation: thin and cheap). We needed something delivered by the holiday and this was the only one we found available. Receipt was quick, but the item was overpriced in our opinion. It's probably worth half the cost at most. (Yes, I appreciate that part of the proceeds are donated to breast cancer charity.) It's not very pink in color."
4,love those period movies...,"This was a very engaging period drama based on some true events which occurred during the war. Although perhaps the movie is a bit fanciful, it presents (with an Irish sense of humor included) a picture of history that is little-known to the American audience. I would definitely watch this again and again. Byrne fans may be a bit disappointed that his role is not greater in the story, but even so, it is very, very good. (Oh, and there are horses in it toooooo!)"
4,Great music to write by....,"Wonderful, wonderful music. Hard to say which track would be my favorite, as that changes from time to time (they are all very good). I suppose I find myself returning most often to Diana's cover of ""Black Crow"".Highly recommended."
1,Elvis has left the building,"Don't waste your time or money on this CD IF, you loved ""The Look Of Love"" & ""When I Look in Your Eyes."" Those 2 CD's were tremendous, sensational, & blow away many times over anything that Norah Jones or other similar artists have done. When you pay $16.99 for a CD, and you don't get what you paid for, you should be able to return it & receive a full refund. This is why the record industry is in trouble. I knew when I read that Elvis Costello (her husband- what's up with that??) helped produce this CD it was in BIG big TROUBLE. Yes it's cute when artists like to explore & try new ideas. But that's not what their fans pay for. Oops, i almost forgot, it's not about the fans who make these artists rich. How true the acronym: ""If it 'aint broke, don't fix it."" Another $16.99+tax down the drain!! What a waste of time & money."
2,"Letdown, dissapointed, and heartbroken","Diana's approach to a song inspired me to go out and start investing time and money into jazz music. I bought all the Diana Krall CD's and Live in Paris DVD, as well as Coltrane, Ella, Miles, Bud Powell, Monk, etc.... So after being a long time devoted fan, I knew what to expect when she released and new album. This time I was shocked. She strayed away from the sound and improvisations that made me fall in love with her in the first place. Was she doing it as a marketing decision, or just exploring different styles of music? Whatever the reason, it was a mistake. I hope she soon gets back into her groove, and showcase her natural talent soon."
5,good memories,Diana Krall continuous her good works. It is different from her pass work only in style. The quality has improved. It is a bit darker but also somewhat lifting. I most definitely enjoyed her songs. It takes a while longer but if you take the time. It is very very good.
2,No jive here.,"My Diana Krall collection might end with this one. I am a big fan, but this one was a disappointment. The songs are so slow and draggy. After listening to some of the lyrics though, it sounds like she recently lost her mother so that could explain it. I don't find myself reaching for this one to play again and again. It's always a good idea to listen to something before you buy. If you like to cry with your wine, you might go for this."
2,Not good,"Compared to her previous work, this new CD is terrible. The first time I listened to it I had to skip through tracks because there is simply no life in the songs. Nothing like her previous work."
1,Why??????,"I have been a fan of Diana's for YEARS. This is truly a bad, bad CD. Please come back, Diana. Leave the husband to sing, play, mutilate his own music."
2,"Diana, a great musician. Making a bad turn?","Don't be misguided by my rating of this album. I encourage you to purchase EVERY album that Diana has ever made. I am a big fan of Diana Krall. Case in point- I traveled from the Cayman Islands via Australia, to see her perform in Toronto, Canada. (Check that out on your maps!) BUT... in my NOT so humble opinion, I feel that Diana would do better to make music with Joni Mitchell or the sort. Joni Mitchell good for Diana...Elvis Costello, well, we'll wait and see. I can only hope that this album is not a sign of what is in store for Diana and her music. I submit the following evidence- Listen to ""A Case of You"" from her album entitled ""Live In Paris"" Now listen to any of the 7 songs on this album that Elvis has credit to.- No Elvis, I DON""T THINK SO! Mind you, this is not to be mistaken as a bad review on Elvis' music. I'll eat Ice-cream or Caviar.-Just not together."
1,such a shame,I used to really like Dianna Krall. Too bad she's teamed up with that racist Elvis Costello.
1,What a disappointment,"As a long time devoted Dianna Krall fan, I was terribly disappointed in her latest effort. The CD has none of the mind stiking brilliance of her earlier work. Perhaps Elvis should just stick to being her husband, and leave her alone in her writing."
3,BATTLE OF THE JAZZ DIVAS,"Diana vs. Dena. They both sing, play piano, compose, arrange so what is the difference? Diana is BORING. and Dena is EXCITING. I stacked my CD player on one side with Diana's latest Cd's and the other side with DENA'S AND HAD MY OWN JAZZ IDOL COMPETITION. AND THE WINNER IS DENA DEROSE HANDS DOWN. Compare song samples here, and you decide if I was right. I ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE YOU WON'T BE BORED. I have played Dena's albums 3 hrs straight and was never bored. Can you say that about Diana's?"
1,Great record if you wanna fall asleep.,"I bit. I wasn't gonna, but I did. This lady is just flat out boring, and I never got the hook about this lady. Her versions of these songs are no better than Marty & Elaine at the world famous Dresden Room in Los Angeles. If I were you guys, I'd buy Brian Evans, Harry Connick, or Norah Jones."
2,"Uninteresting, not enjoyable, disappointing.","Any trace of originality she may or may not have had certainly won't be found on this CD. It's at best a well-produced, sappy pop album.I have enjoyed her other CDs, and like Alfonso mentioned (see his review) -- if you are interested in listening to richly textured, well-sung, swinging jazz classics, then put your hard-earned money elsewhere."
2,The nays have it,"Sorry to say it, since I'm a big DK fan, but the crowd has it right on this one. A disappointing fare, to be sure, with the singular exception of Narrow Daylight. That tune speaks volumes. And being one of the ""departure"" songs in this collection, it proves that Diana is capable of extending her reach without losing her style. Diana, if you're reading this, keep the faith!"
1,Diana: Stick to what got you there!,"Songs stink, arrangements stink, album stinks. What's different? Songs by that immortal composer...Elvis Costello!!?? Gimme a break! Quick, folks, name a great song written by this guy. OK, then, name me ANY song written by this guy? She'd do better doing songs by the REAL Elvis. What happened to Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Duke Ellington? Can any of you imagine Sinatra, Ella, Sarah, Billie, Dinah, or Carmen McRae wanting to record any of this junk? I can't. I guess she figures that since she married the guy, she needs to boost his ego a bit. His songs stink, Diana! She can still play and she can still sing and the players are great, but even using those great ingredients, it still adds up to a bad product."
4,Different than we expected,"I think Krall's fans were expecting something different, but Diana made us a surprise. This CD is less mellodic than her previous works and even more... ""jazzistic"". She didn't took the risk of repeating herself, but forgot - perhaps purpously - to please general public. I believe that only jazz lovers can really enjoy this new album."
2,The artist is free to choose her direction,"Diana's music in this CD is well-liked by many people. It's new and different and, as an artist, I'm sure she will continue to explore the many musical avenues open to her. To my ears, the Diana Krall of yesteryear is the Diana I thoroughly enjoy, with her peak performance being the ""Live in Paris"" offering. In the past, she has given us a fresh interpretation of the old standards. If you've been listening to music for sixty years, you'll most likely prefer the ""old standards"" -- it's a comfort thing. I hope she continues to do well -- she's a hard-working, talented lady. I also hope that she will consider recording some of the familiar music of earlier times."
4,A lovely album.,"Diana sounds lovely, and there are some cool jams. Perhaps it does have some contemporary-pop leanings, but please don't let this deter you from experiencing this album.Diana gives the songs she covers a smooth, elegant touch, and the originals upon which she collaborated with Elvis Costello are great, too. The highlights for me are her covers of Tom Waits' ""Temptation"" Joni's ""Black Crow"", and also the originals ""the girl in the other room"" and ""departure bay."" Really, the entire album is great: It is a slightly different Diana Krall album, and a successful one at that.This album might not blow you away, but it's a wonderful companion on a rainy day or while taking a leisurely drive or walk. It really is great, and I definitely recommend it!"
3,Diana finally grows up,"With this CD she finally transforms herself just like Joni Mitchell did when she recorded Mingus. Of course Diana wil get the same shes ""just a white chick from canada"". But Diana has played and payed her dues, she is best beating the keys with spirit on her LIVE CD.This CD has her discovering the undiscovered country of how Lyrics can sound like bad poetry or cyrstalize feelings. I recomended she read Dylan Thomas poems to improve and transend commom feelings into more convincing emotions. I love Black Crow being a Joni Fan since the sixties but Departure Bays is a perfect ending for a rebirth of this artist.Amor Vincit OmniaBrian"
1,What were they thinking?,"As a Diana Krall fan and an Elvis fan all I can say is what were they thinking? I could have written better songs than this. I bought it the morning it came out with huge anticipation, and I think I will find out if there is any way they can recycle cd's because it is just going to collect dust on my shelf otherwise. Too bad because I have never in my life been excited enough about an album to actually go out the day it is released and buy it. MAYBE I will find someone who will appreciate to give it to, but I doubt it. If this album does well, it is proof that a name can take you a LONG way. If this was a debut album for a new artist, it would be laughed right out of the business and off the charts. Diana does a great job once again of name dropping. What could Elton possibly have to do with this album? That's why I was so surprised to see Elvis being called Declan."
2,Please go back to how you were Diana,"I have all of Diana Krall's CD's, and you can see her evolution as an artist with each one. For me, the two brilliant CDs The Look Of Love and When I Look In Your Eyes were the pinnacle of her achievement. This one I don't like. I have tried hard to like it, have listened to it over and over hoping that there will be at least one song on it that ""speaks"" to me. Alas, there is none. Diana, please go back to your previous style! True loves make bad songwriting teams."
2,Let Down For Core Krall Fans,"This CD is a let down to core fans of Diana Krall. She has walked away from her listener base in favor of an exploratory concept in music. Too bad she has left her jazz standard abilities on the sidelines for music to satisy her intellectual curiosity. It's not like they ran out of standards for her to perform for the next 20 years. Bottom line, stick to your knitting, Diana, and dont walk away from the listeners that helped make you."
1,One Time Only for the Girl in the Other Room,"Okay, this is what I get from this. It is not really bad stuff, but it's not great, either. It is sort of like a bit of Julie London and Peggy Lee with some Bill Evans style piano playing thrown in, then watered down to make it easier to digest for the pop audience. Not as terrible as some have said... but nothing I care to play more than one time. It's pretty bland for jazz in my book. The Costello-Krall songs are not well written and don't go anywhere, either."
3,"Diana is nice, but I would get the GENIE music instead",This is OK music but personally I prefer this unknown Amish artist named GENIE that I found here. Genie has a 4 CD set that you can pick up for about what a CD or 2 of Diana's goes for. Diana's first CD was good but Genie's is even better.
3,"Yes, nothing wrong here but look at the GENIE 4 CD set","I like Diana very much butlong for a bit more spacious, inventive sound.This album underwhelmed me.I suggest the 4 CD set by this Amish artist named GENIE.She actually plays the piano in a most magical way."
1,Congratulations Diana,"Congratulations, Diana, You have turned yourself into Norah Jones. That should sell some CDs."
1,why,"I just don't understand how Diana could put out an album like this. She has now become my poster child for LISTEN BEFORE YOU BUY.I was especially upset that someone of her stature in the music world would title one of her cuts ""Temptation"". That title was already taken, many years ago. I imagine that this was the hook that got a lot of fans of her previous albums to spring for this one. Well this CD is now a coaster or maybe a frisby."
1,"Bubble-Gum Pop, not worthy of Krall","This material is meant for an artist liek Rod Stewart, and the funny thing is all teh standards he's been singing lately, belong to someone like Krall. There's been a major COSMIC SCREWING for this to happen. Too bad she didn't marry a more interesting songwriter like Alec Wilder, so at least she could plug some good songs. A genious move on her husbands part..."
1,"It Could Have Been Worse, I Guess.","Every major artist goes through this phase. They sell a lot of product for the label and then they pretty much get to do whatever they want - at least one time. Springsteen had his Nebraska album. To this day when he plays that garbage in concert everybody takes it as a cue for a restroom break. The seats empty quickly and then they come back in when he returns to his good stuff. Diana Krall is essentially doing the same thing in the jazz context. She had to get this out of her system. Of course the added irritant of Costello didn't help.I'm sure that the very talented lady will eventually come to her senses and return to Gershwin, Porter, Kern and success.Up until now I purchased all her CDs. I'll pass on this one."
2,It's NOT Diana...,"I expected more,,a lot more. Boring songs..and lyrics..Live in Paris is one of the WORLD'S best recordings...The FEEL is what Diana is about.......Oh well...better luck next time..Thanks Al...You're great...Diana you are too,,not this time..Sorry"
2,Disappointing,"On CDs, Diana Krall's greatest asset is her voice. Listening to several of her previous CDs and then to this one, I feel that asset has been severely compromised. Whereas in Live in Paris and earlier albums, the music supports the singing, here, the singing has to compete for attention. When her voice comes through clearly, the singing is as good as ever - but this is the case only in a few tracks. Overall, this CD is a tremendous letdown."
1,"Great in the past, and hopefully again in the future","Diana Krall should be credited by helping to end the obnoxious screaming and yelling that became popular with the ""love anthems"" of Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, and Michael Bolton in the 90s. Thank goodness that is going out of style and this new calming and romantic sound is coming into vogue.Unfortunately, this is probably a bit too watered down, introspective and muted to be exciting, passionate or particularly interesting for more than one listening. DIana's ""Look of Love"", ""Love Scenes"" and ""Live in Paris"" tower above this effort and I hope she gives us more of this type of brilliance again in the future.This CD is imaginative, but seems aimless and confused."
1,Disappointment,This collection of second rate songs is a real disappointment after the Live in Paris CD. I hope this isn't the beginning of the end.
4,Blue Jazz and Trouble.,"I'm a jazz fan. I like Evans, Jarrett, Mehldau, Van Halen, and especially Petrucci. I also like long legs and girls hiding from Bessie in the other room. Hence, this album was a natural for the Hopperoo. I bought this Krall cd on a lark (curly blonde, long, stringy, hair, and a piano make a good impulse buy) and wasn't disappointed. The songs are moody and this is real jazz, not jazzpop (Norah Lips for example). I think the influence of Elvis MacManus most helpful here. Oh, and the long, curly hair. Delightful!"
3,My first Krall,"First recording that is. I heard her first in the beginning of that Clint Eastwood flick a while ago. This is good but I wasn't ""impressed"" like I was from that movie.I have since bought the DTS Surround disc of her album ""Love Scenes"", A Much better release."
2,I Want Some Seafood Mama!,"It was with great anticipation that I awaited the arrival of Diana's new CD. I'm sad to admit that I don't even feel like buying this compilation, based on the excerpts I've listened to thus far. I commend any artist who attempts to graduate from a successful genre, but in the case of Diana Krall, why she ever meandered from her jazz roots baffles me. Her piano playing is a formidable force, and her sultry voice gives her a leg up on most jazz vocalists. Perhaps her marketing team is trying to help her reach more of the masses by having her dabble in pop, but to me, its a dilution of one of the finest talents today. I'm hoping Diana, like Harry Connick Jr. will return to her jazz roots and let other pop singers satiate the bland palate of the masses."
2,One star for each good song on this CD...,"Although I absolutely *loved* ""Temptation"" and ""Narrow Daylight,"" I found that these were the only two songs I could stomach on the entire CD. Of course, I'm no jazz fan to say the least, so this might explain my choices for best songs. I must say, though, that Diana Krall has a wonderful voice, much better suited to Blues, and it is my opinion that she shouldn't waste it on jazz (which has about as much appeal to me as rap). But that's just me..."
2,she dialed this one in,"I own all of Diana Krall's albums and have enjoyed watching her career soar. Usually the songs she sings show off her piano skills, her vocal phrasing, and her emotive abilities. This one, however, really does fall flat. The songs are forgettable - there's not one you'd find yourself humming later or belting out in the shower. Instead, they are slow and without any decisive melody. Listening to it the other night, I thought, ""This sounds like a second-tier nightclub singer."" I think poor song selection is the real culprit. To this day, my favorite Diana Krall album remains ""All for You"", a collection of Nat King Cole tunes. Buy that one if you want to hear the real jazz that Diana Krall is capable of."
2,Not Diana,"Diana Krall's latest CD is, unfortunately, not in her usual exciting style. Ms Krall needs to go back to her roots--jazz and ballads--where she excels. This CD is a great disappointment to one who has all her collection and has attended a number of concerts. It is dull, it doesn't swing (as she is so capable of doing). The lyrics are not uplifting at all, and the music, although it has its moments, is not up to her past great offerings. Although I was tempted to rate this CD with one star, I gave it two, because this is Diana--still a great jazz pianist and singer. Let's hope she goes back to her 'original room.'"
1,Beware the enhanced CD,"The enhanced CD will not play on a PC nor will it play on my car stero. If you want this CD, get the standard version."
2,..And Now for Something Different,"""The Girl in the Other Room, is something else: her and new husband Elvis Costello's attempts to make music perfect for entertaining in their huge New York apartment. As such, it's kind of a snooze. Half of Room's 12 tunes are Krall-Costello co-writes, including one called ""Abandoned Masquerade"" that I won't quote out of respect for, well, ""lyrics as a concept""."
2,A Very Disappointed Fan,"I was a devoted fan of Diana's. I have all her earlier albums. But recently, I have become very disappointed with her current albums. I'am a jazz devotee. When I counted over 90 reviewers who share my disappontment with this latest album. I decided to look for an up and coming jazz vocalist who sings, plays, composes jazz and was lucky to find such a singer at the jazz festivals, I attended. Let me introduce you to Dena Derose, who I think is everything that Diana is not. ""Love's Holiday"" is an extremely satisfying, refreshing CD. Her signature sound is vocalizing her piano solos or scatting with her swinging piano solos. Her voice is crystalline in sound, with impeccable jazz phrasing where she can easily change keys or slide through the bars with horn-like pacing. She has an outstanding backup DeRose has arrived. I guarantee there won't be one disapointed jazz fan of Dena Derose. Win me back Diana.."
2,Not a catastrophe but THIS IS NOT JAZZ,"Diana Krall is trying to market herself to both the NOrah Jones fans and the Alt Rock (Joni Mitchell, Elvis Costello) fans. Unfortunately this is NOT the material she should be singing. I wish she would go back to Jazz and not do Rock covers. PLEASE!"
4,The girl's got guts,"A departure, but a welcome one. It's brave of her not to give in to following a proven formula, and experiment with other formats, especially in a time where singing standards seems to be the surefire way to make it (could list several of the fresh crop of artists here). Rather than simply filling an album with empty but catchy tracks, she has stressed harmonic and lyrical content, resulting in a record that keeps on giving - I find something new in it at each listen. Plus, her piano-playing is far better than the previous albums, almost (though not quite) coming close to seeing her live. I'm witholding one star for some of the Krall/ Costello compositions that sound somewhat awkward as performed by Diana, but I have high hopes for their future collaborations."
1,A very disappointing CD,"Diana Krall should stick to what she does best, i.e. singing jazz standards, and improve on that. The recent commercial success should not lead her astray to the muddy marshes of pop music.This will probably be a cry into the wind because I expect that the marketing plague of our time, will make sure that customers will be convinced that this is a most personal and original CD and that the collaboration with Elvis Costello has resulted in an unique cross-over synergy.The bottom line is that I don't enjoy this CD."
5,The Girl In The Other Room,"Give the girl a break. This is good stuff. Perhaps not what you'd come to expect but listen and know she's got teeth for this too! Everyone, artists especially, should be encouraged to visit another room now and again....maybe she'll stay awhile, maybe progress again. Sit back and enjoy the journey without preconception. Complaisancy killed creativity."
3,Masterpiece? no. Disaster? no,"I am a fan no doubt of Diana. Her Live in Paris album was so refreshing after her schmoopy, syrupy string fests of the prior two albums that she got back to playing and interpreting mostly uptempo standards and pop tunes. That is her meat and potatoes and her piano self-accompaniment and soloing is superior when the producers let her play. This album explores original material and new moods. I would characterize many of the original numbers as falling in a sort of brooding, contemplative almost melancholy style. It isn't Peel Me a Grape and it isn't I've Got you Under My Skin either. I can't fault the lyrics because I always ignore them, no matter who wrote them. Is it my favorite album of hers no, but it is something new to ponder and has it grown on me since the first listen? Yes. Will it become my favorite? not likely. But it is certainly not the disaster others have made it out to be."
2,Costello is not a lyricist,"While Diana Krall is an amazing pianist and singer, even she needs decent material to work with. The songs on this CD were written by Elvis Costello and the lyrics remind me of children trying to make everything rhyme. Even though I am a Diana Krall fan, I had difficulty staying with this CD through the last song."
3,Why Costello,"I was very worried when I heard that Diana married Elvis Costello, and I was afraid that what is happening to her, would happen. Diana is a Jazz musician, coming from what Jazz is about, musicianship, solos, and showing why you practice 8 hours a day. Elvis Costello is the exact opposite, very little talent, no practice needed. I notice that other reviews are bothered by the lack of solos. Wait unitl he has a little more time to corrupt her, and turn her into a pop star. Well at least it will leave room for a new Diana Krall that hopefully won't be corrupted. Maybe on her next album she will have Costello, and Kenny G so she can put the final stake in the heart of her music."
1,A disappointment,"This CD is a disappointment to me. The only track I like on this CD is ""Almost Blue"" in which Diana sounds more like herself and the song is more like a song.I am surprised that she actually came to Melbourne to promote it.Leslie ChenDonvale, Australia"
2,Destroying her roots and married to him?????,"As the ""Stomach Turns"" so does the destroying of talented artists by listining to untalented back stage people and unevolved management..woe are we in San Francisco since the brightest days of a new talent has changed and hopefully, does not disappear. Julie London please come back!...Well, Diana, maybe JEWELL can start singing some standards as she was raised with them and yet hasn't sold out..and Elvis...This one's for YOU! FUHGEDABOUDIT!"
1,This cd is horrible,"Diana stinks. In fact she looks like she is smelling something stinky when she sings ! Check it out ... Seriously , Diana is a lucky woman.She's sings ok but her little piano playing is pitiful. She has about 3 licks that she uses over and over. Her compositions are mediocre, without any substance or form. They sound like tunes written by a bad musician in high school. Her piano was actually better when she just stayed within her tinky tinky limitations, but now, she seems to want to be a player.... too late Diana, you should have practiced when you were young. Why don't you hire a real piano player ?"
