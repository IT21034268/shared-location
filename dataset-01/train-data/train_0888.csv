4,When more in spanish,"Nice serie, funny, easy and relax!!...I like to see more, but is only in inglish!! I hope soon, these series and CSI show the new season in spanish"
5,Love the show!!! Best (kept secret) show on TV!,"Great show! Wonderful characters! Lots of crazy comedy! If you watch the series, you will fall in love with the characters and all of the crazy things they do! Not a show on TV like it. Every season is better than the season before! I didn't watch my first ""Chuck"" episode until it had been on for 3 years. I can't believe I missed such a great show!"
5,Great!!,"This pilot made me wish for the next episode. It combine, with a smooth and cohesive style, the action of a CIA drama (like Alias) with the comedy of a witty sitcom (like Scrubs). The combination was quick and nearly seemless, leaving me awed and excited."
5,Sure To Be A Hit!!!,"This show will be the next big hit for NBC. The writing and acting are amazing. The plot and development of the characters is spot on. This will grab anyone who sees it and they're sure to be back for more ""Chuck""! From the beautiful CIA Agent to the Nerd Herd, ""Chuck"" is looks to be a standout show this year."
1,I DIDNT BUY THIS!!!!,THIS IS THE FIRST I'M SEEING THIS? I NEVER BOUGHT THIS? WHAT IS THIS ABOUT? I NEED SOMEONE TO CONTACT ME ASAP!!!!
1,stupid show,"stupid show, stupid plots, some actors made it fun, sort of.who bought this thing for the network? Are they still employed?"
4,nice on blue ray,"Chuck is one of my favorite shows. The blu ray 1st season is great, except one of the discs, all the episodes appeared a little grainy. No worries, nothing major"
4,Pilot?,"They call Chuck a ""pilot"". He's not a pilot. He's some guy who works in a big-box electronics store.Very misleading."
3,"Really, this is HD?","Chuck rocks, but the bluray quality sucks. If you find a good deal on the DVD, save your money."
5,"For a Good Time, Call.","If you want an awesomely funny everyman show, pop this one in the DVD player, sit back and just enjoy the absurdity, emotion and action."
5,Chuck,Excellent series!! It was a great move when the show was brought back after being cancelled after season 1. It was a typical corporate (stupid) move to cancel it after season 5.
5,Chuck has it all.,"Chuck: action, romance, great characters, engaging plot, and hilarious.Chuck Bartowski's life changes one day when all the CIA's secrets get downloaded into his brain. Unfortunately for him, he must keep it a secret from his friends and family for fear of putting them in danger and unfortunately for him, he has no CIA training. As the plot thickens we're on the edge of our seats...between bouts of laughter, of course. Chuck's crazy antics and endearing character have us rooting for him all the way."
5,LOVE this show,I think this show is very entertaining !!! the only draw back is Morgan his best friend I hope they get rid of him he is so annoying. Everything else is perfect great blend of comedy and action.thanks
2,This is so terrible cd,"We'll i am huge fan of kylie but this album is kylie's worst.it is so meanful. ""Word is out"" ""give me just a little more time""""finer feelings"" and ""live and learn"" are great songs that can be listened any time but songs like ""let's get to it"" and ""No world without you"" are terrible songs...does kylie really sing like this. This album is hoorrible and i'm glad that it really didn't sold as musch as the first three releases!"
2,Rather boring actually...,"I'm usually a big Kylie fan, but this is probably one of my least fav albums. It's just too boring and sounds very out of date...pop just wasn't that good in the early 90's. But there are some tracks that I do like: ""Right here, right now"" is ok and I've always had a soft spot for ""Guess I like it like that"". The rest though...is pretty boring. Don't buy it unless it's on sale or if you've had the chance to listen to the tracks first."
4,Great reference book,"I purchased this book while taking a medical Spanish course and I plan to keep it to flip through regularly as a refresher if I do not end up using Spanish on a daily basis. This book allowed me to quickly find key phrases to communicate with patients (ex: do you have a fever, how did you take his temperature, etc. ). It is appropriate for beginners as it includes phonetic pronunciations. The only disadvantage is that there is no glossary at the back, so you must be familiar with the lay out of the book to quickly reference phrases. I would recommend this book to any practicing or training pediatrician who wants to improve communication with their Hispanic patients."
5,Super product,My Rottweilers play rough and this collar is a must have! All three of mine have only these collars from the time I got them as puppies.
2,Quite Dated and in Need of an Update,I have purchased this and already used it in Mexico. It is helpful to get you to any of the MAJOR cities but even within Guadalajara it was clearly very dated and did not compare favorably with a GPS that my friend was using that he purchased in Mexico.I bought the Garmin GPS specifically so I could use this map in Mexico. I called Garmin and asked when an update would be available and was told they have no plans to update. When traveling to Ajijic it did not show ANY streets or even a road to get to the city. Ajijic is on the shore of Lake Chipala -- the largest lake in Mexico.Let us hope with that with more requests Garmin will finally update this map. It is at least five years out of date.KS
4,"Not perfect, but very accurate","Its a very good product, lacks a little updating, but it has already helped me to get out from a traffic jam.Some street names are no longer the same, as a lot of new places are not there, but I must say its really worth to buy."
2,only slightly useful,"GARMIN 010-10755-00 City Select Mexico NT V2 (Micro Secure Digital Card)this map is only marginally useful. I bought it for my daughter who is taking a road trip and her comment is that it is very little help. the attactions (camp grounds, etc.) it says are close are really about 100 miles away. nearly a total waste. she has written Garmin about it but no response yet. no updates available .. at any time. you have to buy a whole new map. I would advise just buying a good paper map unless you want the frustration of being lost"
3,Not very reliable,"I purchased this Garmin product in hopes that it could guide me out of the maze of streets of Mexico City, However it failed to do so. Leaving Mexico City towards Queretaro, it tried to guide me via Toluca? And once on the main highway it does not recognized the toll roads and kept telling me to get off and go down the Libre. It did, however, worked ok in Queretaro, Irapuato, Leon, and Guadalajara. You must be very careful on how you enter the addresses otherwise you will end up in another Colonia. I rely mostly on just moving the map on the screen to see what was coming ahead and plan accordantly. I hope this helps someone who is planning to purchase this item."
4,"used it just enough to see it works, but not tested it heavily","I aws able to install it and it worked well. However, I did not do a lot of traveling with it, so I can't tell how accurate it is."
3,Better than nothing!,"Does not work as their counter part in EU or Europe but get you to the zone or nearby the address you are looking for. Do not expect door to door directions. I would buy it again, it is defintly better than having nothing at all."
1,Get an atlas,"I can't believe Garmin sells this product in good conscience. It was horrible. It didn't even know we were on the road half of the time. It doesn't know anything about the toll roads, couldn't find addresses, didn't know what exits to take, etc. Essentially we were lost all the time. We had a Mexico map hoping the Garmin would fill in the gaps. But what you really need is a good detailed atlas of the country because the Garmin is not worth the cost. It probably hasn't been updated in years and never should have been sold so incomplete anyway. I know roads change all the time but this map didn't know anything. Even in major cities. It couldn't tell me how to get from Mexico City to Cuernavaca, two of the biggest cities in Mexico with pretty established road systems. We used a Garmin map in Ireland and it knew what exits to take, how to find addresses, even which lane to be in. This map did none of that. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1,Poor Mexico Database,"I traveled in northern Baja. I found some roads missing. The POI's in this area are virtually absent. In San Felipe, about 100 miles south of the border, the closest POI's of any sort were across the border in the US. I don't think it is worth the money."
1,Garmin Mexico N7 2009 Version,I have been using Garmin devices in the US and Africa with great success over the past 5 years. I used the Mexico NT 2009 Map with my Garmin Nuvi 260W and was extremely dissapointed. While traveling in the Puerto Vallarta and Bucerias area the device was unable to find almost any address that we entered. The tracking was off by at least 1 and on many times two blocks. It would try to get you to go down roads that did not exist. It was definitly not worth the money.
4,"Ok, but #3 is better","I consider myself to be an advanced stepper and after enjoying Amy's #3 DVD I was so excited to get this one. Unfortunately it's not as good as #3. The choreography is more confusing (I like challenging, but not confusing!) and the music isn't as good. I think the combinations are shorter too so it only takes a few minutes to do all combos, where all combos in #3 took close to 10 minutes. If you're looking for a good advanced step workout I'd suggest #3, not this one."
5,Fabulous!,This workout has great music and challenging moves. It is a must to go over the preview moves before starting the workout. If you go over the preview moves you will get the routine down faster because she goes through the routines fast. This workout is for intermediate and advanced fitness levels with step aerobic experience. It is so much fun once you get the moves down.
2,too difficult,This was way to difficult to follow and I consider myself an experienced stepper. I keep Step Challenge 2 only because I have been trying to learn the routine and didn't feel I should return it
5,Great work out!,Amy Bento's step challenge 4 is a great work out great if you like a dancing kind of work out! Came in condition noted & very fast delivery.
4,short stories,"I want to say (like all the other reviewers) that I too enjoyed this book. It is very reflective.That being said, I wasn't expecting this layout of the book. It is many short stories or short reflections. I was somewhat expecting a ""book"" to read. I was surprised by this format. I wanted to specifically inform other portential buyers of that fact."
5,The Best I've Read,"I'm a mom and a grandma so I've read a lot of books on motherhood and parenting. This is the most honest,practical, real-to-life encouragement I've come across yet! Mary DeMuth is an extraordinary author! Her 60 devotional writings tug at your heartstrings. Sometimes her personal stories make you want to cry. Other times you simply laugh out loud. This is a ""must read"" for anyone who wants a good dose of HOPE. And we ALL need that! I hadn't even finished the book before I ordered more for gifts."
2,refreshing,Loved this daily devotional book. I only wish it was longer. As a Mom you sometime question weather God really knew what He was doing when he put you in charge. This was a refreshing way to start my Day. Includes little stories of real life. Made me feel I was not alone. Wonderful
1,doesn't work on wood floors,"My daughter received this stopper with her cello. I agree with the reviewer above. It doesn't have enough ""non slip"" product on the bottom to keep it from sliding on a hard wood or linoleum floor. It just slides all around. The bottom padding is a fine rubber, but doesn't grip enough. It is useless. I would recommend another product."
1,this looks like a cheap copy of Zumba,"everybody has tried to knock off the Zumba videos...no one has been able to do it. this is a joke, they even copied the Zumba logo."
4,Very Sensual Workout!,"You burn calories while you are learning to add a little spice and sexy sensualness to your dancing skills. Easy to follow for those who know the basics or have other dancing backgrounds like salsa,lambada, belly dancing, merengue and others..."
5,Real samba from a real Brazilian and its sooooooo much fun!,"I've been dancing samba for some years and I must say that this is an awesome video! Great choreography. The instructor has an awesome personality, so even though you're sweating you touche off, you still have fun. I take this video with me when I'm traveling so if I can't make it to the gym, I can have this to do. I never get tired of it. Worth the money."
5,Awesome,This is a great work-out to really learn routines and the carnaval section at the end is an added bonus. Totally different than anything else out there.
1,Build Me Up Buttercup,"This is not the original version, so, you can imagine how disappointed I was. The guy who sings it does the song no justice at all."
2,I was disapointed,I was disapointed that this wasn't the original version. I wouldn't recommend this CD.
1,DON'T BUY THE REMIX,"When you think the deal is too good, it is. I bought this because it said it was the original artists. IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. When I listened to it in the car I had to laugh. I later saw the small print on the back of the cd case that stated it was rerecorded in 1994. Wish I would have read the other reviews before making my purchase."
1,Duped,"I should have read the other reviews before I bought this. The song, Build Me Up Buttercup was okay, but the others were terrible. Too late I realized this was a remake with one of the Foundations singers, not the originals. A big mistake."
1,very dissapointed,The cd was misrepresented. These are not the original recordings. In the ad it did not state otherwise.
2,Not the Original Recordings,"If you want to hear the Foundations Re-make their original tunes then this is the CD for you! However, if your searching for the Original Versions - look elsewhere!"
3,The Foundations - 'Build Me Up Buttercup' (Prime Cuts),"I've seen several other reviews/mentions where patrons note that the tracks on this CD aren't the original recordings.Not sure what they're talking about because these cuts seem to be the 'original' mixes than I,personally remember.Especially the first two,""Baby Now That I've Found You"" and ""Build Me Up Butter Cup"".A couple of others that I thought were decent include ""Lonely And Sad"",""You Can't Fool Me"" and ""No One Loves Me Like You Do"".That's five good R&B laced soul goods out of ten.Not too bad.Line-up:Clem Curtis-vocals,Alan Warner-guitar,Pat Burke-sax,Eric Allen-trombone,Peter Macbeth-bass and Tim Harris-drums.For any young 'uns out there who might wish to purchase a copy for an elder,this artist might appeal to fans of Stylistics,Al Green,Chi-Lites and possibly Wilson Pickett."
5,Highly Recommended!,"No financial innovation of the past half-century has been more important than option analysis. The notion that option analysis could help corporate managers make more effective investment decisions was bold news in the early 1980's, but did not make much of an impact beyond rather narrow circles. Options are hard to understand - the math can be intimidating and few people have been able to explain option analysis in a way that makes sense to the financial laity. This book is, therefore, long overdue. Marion A. Brach delivers the essential logic and analytical framework of real options to any corporate manager. The text can be heavy going at times, and the author has an annoying habit of referring to examples without explaining them (footnotes cite other publications where explanations may be found). Still, we recommend this book highly. It shows why there is more to management decisions than many managers may have heretofore considered."
1,Horrible piece of literary junk,"Of all writings I have read to this date, never have I came across a more horribly written literary piece. The concepts of voluntary solitude which this author seem to advocate is badly presented through his more than mundane experience as a hermit, a spiritual, or what you will. The writings of other cultures, particularly that of the Eastern tradition, has been consistently poorly presented. In short, it is all a bunch of bs"
4,Walden,"I truly enjoyed this read. It may help to listen to the audio cassette beforehand. I find Thoreau inspirational. Many times you step back and realize how beautiful all of life's intricacies are, how wonderful life truly is & how lucky we are. Thoreau has embraced every minute detail of natural life, as it was meant to be & has successfully captured it in print. I love the fact that each line is a ""novel"" in itself. I loved the book and listen to the audio cassette often. Buy it, buy it, buy it."
1,Idiotic jargon,"...I would not, if I had the authority, allow this book to circulate at all, not least because it was so horribly written in such circular language that Mr. Thoreau seemed to favor, but because of the fact that he so completely misused such Eastern writings as he could get his hands on, and the thought process of this fool of a man is absolutely astounding."
1,Obsolete Editions,"Teachers and Thoreau fans beware: this anthology contains heavily redacted versions of Thoreau's works and is not a reliable textual source. The version of _A Week_ is missing huge chunks of vital material, though the editor claims that he has included a complete version. Many titles and smaller details are wrong as well. The source editions for this anthology are pre-WWII. Much has changed for the better in the interim, and you cheat yourself by not ordering a more recent anthology--the Library of America one is excellent, textually impeccable."
3,acceptable,"I shall need to revisit this post after nine months -- unlikely to happen -- before you, the reader, can determine its suitability as a replacement battery. Sure any new battery will 'function' out of the box, but how well will an aftermarket battery perform months after use? no way to tell until then.NONE of the 'reviews' here have that information for you."
4,Longer life battery than the stock one,"This battery lasts much longer than the stock battery that came with the device. Of course my old battery had gotten older and was beginning to be worn out.On the bad side, it is a larger battery that sticks out of the back of the device more. It comes with its own cover to replace the default one. It then takes more room, but with a nice aspect of lasting longer. I don't know how much longer since I only use my iPaq occasionally, but my old would last only about a week of infrequent use and this seems to last at least a week and a half or maybe two."
3,bring back the original drainboard,"I was really looking to purchase the old-style Rubbermaid drainboard, which was excellent. Unfortunately I rec'd the smaller, new-style drainboard which is clearly inferior to the original. What knucklehead(s) at Rubbermaid decided to fix something that was not broken?"
4,picture is misleading,This dish drainer is absolutely fine but I had been looking everywhere for a long-ways drainer and this picutre looks like that but when the product arrived it is a side-ways drainer. I had to re-arrange my countertop to get it to fit. That seems to be the way everyone is making them these days so I kept it because I was able to get it in bisque to match my new dish drainer and sink mat.
1,Where did Rubbermaid go?,"This product is absolute junk. Even though the product is sold using the same part number as the original (1182), it is nowhere close to being the same. I have used and loved Rubbermaid products for many years. The ""new"", but definitely not improved product is much smaller, thinner and made of a much harder plastic (not ""RUBBERmaid""). It is so much smaller that it will not fit over the rim of my sink. The original version fits fine. I also ordered the matching drain rack which is also make from a much lighter gauge wire and is very flimsy. I had been looking for a replacement drain board for a while, but couldn't fine one. I got really excited when I found that the same item number was back in stock. That lasted only until I received the shipment. Rubbermaid must have sold their name to some inferior company. It looks like another fine USA company bit the dust! What a shame!"
1,Horrendous,"Rubbermaid used to make the best drain boards -- made of RUBBER (wow, what a concept), with a good tilt to drain the water into the sink. I have an old 1182 drainboard which I love; I hate that it's wearing down because this new product is AWFUL. First, it's made of PLASTIC -- the drainer slips all over the board. Second, there is not a good tilt to it: the water just sits on it instead of draining into the sink. I can't imagine why anyone at Rubbermaid would re-engineer a great product into this piece of garbage. Awful."
1,rubbermaid draIN TRAY,Very unhappy w/ this rubbermaid product. It is not like any previous purchased trays from them. It is so light weight & flimsy that it doesn't even stay put on the counter top. The drain water doesn't drain unless you prop it up in the back. I am taking my old one out of trash & throwing this one away.
2,Forget Rubbermaid!! Kitchenaid makes one with the lip on the short side!!,"I can't imagine why it has been so extremely hard to find a drain board with the lip along the short side, but at last, it turns out that KitchenAid makes a nice sturdy-looking (I haven't ordered it yet but you can be sure I will) very large 22"" x 16"" drainboard and it costs about $8 at most sites. Google KitchenAid drainboard (or drain board); Amazon does not seem to carry it. My search this morning turned up Sears among other reputable sites. It appears to come in black and white only, but I can live with that!"
2,Rubbermaid 11-82 Large Drainer Tray,"I was very excited about ordering the RubbermaidBisque drainer tray. Not one retailer had the color, plus I wanted a sideways drainer. My old drainer tray is the same size and about the same color. That is where the similarity ends. The new tray is Very lightweight & flimsy.I am extremely disappointed in the ""quality"". I do give two stars because it is the right color & it is a sideways drainer.theSweetPea"
1,why is this sideways??,"I bought one of these at Fry's yesterday, and a nice glass mug just shattered all over my kitchen floor because of the bad design of this drainboard.Who decided that people can't get the drainboard design that they want?"
1,terrible product,I purchased the drainer and drain board. The silverware holder is not a big as the old ones. The drain board is a joke. I bought another drainer and drain board hoping they were bigger and better. They were not. The water doesn't drain off the new ones either. I would rather pay more and get the original any day. Listen up Rubbermaid.
1,not rubber,"Even the name of the drain is from rubbermaid the product is plastic not the rubber product of years past. Too bad, it used to be a good product. Just remember that even though it is called rubbermaid it doesn't mean that it is made with rubber.the plastic slides around and it is not as wide as the old drain used to be and the sides are not as high."
1,Drain Boards are no longer made of the quality Rubbermaid material as formerly used,"I am trying to buy a Drain Board that drains water from the short side. The product that I recently purchased: Rubbermaid 1182MABISQU Basic Drain Boards is NOT RUBBERAMID, the ""new"", product is, much thinner, made of harder plastic and quite flimsy and inferior to what Rubbermaid used to produce; I know the aforementioned to be true because recently I found Rubbermaid Drain Board that was purchased around 1993, it is RUBBERMAID. Could someone direct us as to how we could contact Rubbermaid? I contacted Rubbermaid in the past but did not receive a response. The marketing people at Rubbermaid are missing a whole marketing niche of people who need a large Drain Board that drains water from the short side."
1,Disappointed,This drain tray does not work at all. It drains over edge onto counter instead of off side into sink. I am unsure if this is a defect in my particular tray or overall design.
2,Poor design,It fits side-ways to the sink and always leaks around both edges. I would not choose white again - something darker.
2,buyer beware,"Just be careful when reading the descriptions on some of the 'assorted' toys. I thought I was getting the assortment, all of them and just got one. there's nothing wrong with the toy. it's just that with the ridiculous shipping the two dollar toy turned into an $8.10 little rubber hamburger. This happened with another 'assorted toy' I got on here too. I had gotten avariety pack of six balls and thought these were the same thing. Just watch this."
2,slits don't filter out tea,"I have had this for a month or two and it does seem thin/delicate so I can see how it could easily break. There are also bubbles in the bottom of the glass cup so it doesn't seem like it was made very well. My main complaint, however, is that the slits in the internal glass chamber are not thin enough to keep the tea particles and bits from going through to the cup of tea. When you try to pull the chamber and lid up water stays in the chamber because the slits are clogged with tea. This is especially problematic if you are making green or similar tea that will turn bitter if you brew it too long. The cup is cute and perfect for what I wanted however I will hardly use it unless I am using large leaves or tea without small particles, which is essentially never. Too bad."
2,Nice but base wobbly,"Who knows, maybe this was one with a slightly parabolic base, but still, the base is small in relation to the cup's size and with a not perfectly level surface underneath ours sat a bit crooked and if jostled, like on a tray, was easy to tip over entirely. Other than the base it was well made (although too light) and I liked it very much. Sort of sad it was a flop. A thicker glass weighted base, even in the shape of this cup, if bottom was really flat would provide more protection. We have goblets at home not unlike this shape that have thicker glass weighted bases and never a problem of stability. Using one now, in fact, and did a test prior to this review to make sure."
2,A Few Flaws,"There are a few things not as practical with this infuser.The lid has a knob that does not permit to use it as a rest for the infuser insert once the tea is ready to drink. The insert itself has very small openings and clog easily with loose tea herbs, which makes the straining a longer process. Also, the infuser insert has such a small edge and sits tightly on the cup, which makes it difficult to grab and hold. It is also very hot because of the tea. Last but not least, the insert doesn't fit on any other mug I have, which was the main reason for me to purchase the item. There are others which do fulfill those practical specs.However, if you can overlook all those design flaws, this is the tea infuser for you."
4,"Great, but thin glass","These cups work great. I really like them, but my only complaint is that they are too thin. For the price I think they shouldn't be so fragile. I bought two of these and gave my family strict instructions not to put these in the dishwasher. They ignored my request, so now one of my cups has a crack in the infuser. My recommendation is to use these cups, but don't put them in the dishwasher. Carefully hand-wash them."
2,Not Good for Fine Tea Leaves,This is a pretty and convenient tea mug but when I tried using it with some Japanese tea the tea leaves clogged the slots cut in the infuser. I ended up buying another tea pot with a traditional wire mesh which works very well.
1,Sun's Tea (TM) 12oz Personal All Glass Made Tea Infuser & Mug (Teapot),From the picture & description I expected to receive a mug & infuser. What I received was this funky little teapot & a diffuser that only fit halfway in the teapot. No time to return as it was needed for a gift the next day. I kept the infuser and gave them a tea ball. They thought the pot was cute.This is the first item in over 500 that I have purchased on Amazon that was downright mis-represented.
4,Very handy tea for one,"This Tea infuser is great for those times when you only need one cup. I like it better than the cups with the wire mesh strainer, because they hold the tea up top, while this one allows the tea to settle deeper in the water. This creates a more even brew. Another positive is the clear cup allows you to see how strong the tea is getting without having to lift out the strainer in a ceramic mug."
1,Nice looking but terrible quality,"This glass jar looks beautiful. The lid broke while I was opening the package. No, I did not drop it. The lid simply hit the glass jar gently and it got chipped. I couldn't believe how fragile the glass is. The glass feels kinda thin, not like those tevana glass bottles which are thick and sturdy. Even if It didn't break, I don't think I want to use it for hot tea. I don't recommend this for any kind of drink. It's just cheap quality."
4,Nice glass Infuser,This is a rather nice glass infuser that can be used in the microwave. The only downfall is that finely shredded tea or dust makes it through the slits in the glass.
3,good service,thin glass not very practical for everyday use suns are sending another one which should be sturdier
4,Tea on the Go,"This is a very unique and elegant setup with cup, infuser, and lid all together. My expectations have been met. The lid fits tight enough to keep the tea from spilling out in the car while turning, stopping, or accelerating. Handle stays relatively cool to the touch when hot tea is in the cup. The infuser can be a little difficult to retrieve once the tea is brewed due to its nice fit into the cup.The clear glass is a nice touch. We have not tested its durability in the microwave, only with the standard brewing with hot-water from a kettle."
2,"Works, but fragile",This mug works very well for it's intended purpose. My only complaint is that the glass is much thiner than I expected. I haven't had it quite two weeks yet and the lid has already been broken from a very short (2 or 3 inches) drop onto a counter top. It should still work without the lid but I feel like the rest of it is probably going to end up broken as well. If it does I'll be looking for a sturdier replacement.
2,"Great band, poor video.","I've seen this band many times and really wanted something to remember the concerts by, now that I live in America and don't get to go to their shows.This, unfortunately, wasn't it.Too much talking, too much fan gushing, not enough music. Not a single whole song, just clips; and ""just clips"" of 7 minute, classically structured, instrumental pieces is just a painful tease.I hate to say ""don't buy it"" because the band was so great, but seriously - don't buy it."
4,Nice Scent,"Good lotion, nice smell...bottle is a bit small for the money. My preference is the desserted island scent but this is good too!"
5,POWERFUL AND REWARDING!,"This small, but mighty little book has truly been eye opening for me and for those I lead in a small group bible study. I cannot tell you the impact it is having on us and especially in me alone. Thanks to R.C. Sproul and his straight forward teaching in this book, we can grow in our spirituality and have a much richer relationship with God."
4,Great for New Believers,"5 Things Every Christian Needs to Grow by R.C. Sproul is a great book. Sproul does a great job of introducing 5 comon ""means of grace (""tool that God uses to strengthen and nurture us so that we grow in conformity to Christ,"" page 84). Each chapter is written in an engaging style. Sproul uses an insightful story to draw the reader in, puts forth a solid case based on Scriputre, while pointedly drawing out application for Western believers.The book is quite brief at 135 pages, but the content serves as a great introduction for new believers. This book seems like a great discipleship tool and aid to those who are loging to grow deeper. The author's writing style is simple yet engaging. This is a great book to give someone who wants to grow in their faith, yet hasn't developed the discipline of being a good reader. The brief nature of the book won't be daunting and the personable writting style of Sproul will be sure to draw them into the book."
4,Phantom Cutie,"I am a collector of anything Phantom of the Opera...this little guy is a nice addition to my collection. He's called a Universal Monster ie...Frankenstein, the Mummy, but he's not scary...he's just adorable. He's all dressed up for the opera in his black suit and cape...naturally, he is also wearing his mask. It would have been nicer if the doll would have had the yellow eyes of the original character, but all in all a nice purchase."
3,Unlikeable story line with unlikeable characters,"The story is very slow, I kept on skipping pages to get to the action. Lindsay is totally annoying, and Jenks is a bit more palatable but not by much. The first 150 pages is a waste of time and there's way too much unnecessary banter that is contrived. Other side characters in there is more interesting, but those two dominate the story."
2,"mediocre writing, annoying characters, unnecessary sex scenes","I was pretty unimpressed by this book....my first by this author. The writing was not impressive....almost high school banter/language by most of the characters. None were that likeable (except Jenkins) nor did any have much depth. The erotic scenes were nauseatingly long and unnecessarily over the top. If I have to hear ""As he entered her"" one more time...... It's like the author gets lost on an erotic fantasy tangent. Just trashy filler that ads very little to the story. Not a bad book but there are MUCH better authors out there IMO (Kellerman, Balducci, Hosp) to name a few."
3,Not Up To Speed,"While entertaining, the book seemed to be made up of too many simple mini-plots rather than the one or two complex plots as in her past books. I still like her style and enjoyed Izzie's humor even though at times it was a little overkill. Speaking of kill - I could have done without the Serial Killer descriptions. I know these individuals have to be portrayed as evil but it was a little too graphic for my tastes. I prefer the usual challenges and predicaments of the SEALS in prior books. Enjoyed the different cold locale compared to usual jungle scenes. Still enjoyable and will read her next book."
3,Not my favorite,"This was the first Suzanne Brockmann novel I have read that left me dissatisfied. It seemed that there was too much of everything: too much emphasis on Jenk's short stature, his repeated overtures to Tracy despite clear signals that she was not interested, Dave's relentless hovering over Sophia, and the over-the-top graphic horror of the scenes with the serial killer. The story didn't flow as smoothly and logically as her earlier works did. Tracy's problem with alcohol isn't even introduced until more than halfway through. Even then, it is given little significance--but in reality, an alcoholic's behavior is governed by this addiction, either managing it or giving in to it.I will still read her books, but I won't buy them before reading the local library's copy first. She's a great talent, and I hope she returns to her earlier form of well-defined characters and believable plots."
3,NOT HER BEST BOOK,"I was disappointed in this book, I expected a resolution of Decker/Sophia, or maybe a book about Jules, instead got a serial killer,and a romance about Jenks, one of the lesser Toubleshooters. This is an Okay book, I have always had to read her books in one sitting,but this one didn't grab me, and that is a first for the Brockmann books"
2,Sad to Say ...,"If this were the first Suzanne Brockmann book I had ever read I probably would never buy another one. I loved her first books in the Troubleshooters series. They were well written with good plots, dialog, and wonderful WWII backstories. Her latest books fall way short of this. This one has too much crude sexual banter which doesn't ring true and way too many acronyms which don't add anything to the story. Also the gory details were not wanted or needed. I was really disappointed. Unfortunately Suzanne seems to be following in Stuart Woods footsteps. His first books were wonderful (Chiefs, etc.) but he now churns them out as fast as he can and they are no longer worth reading."
3,Latest arc is a bit disappointing,"While I enjoyed the wargames scenario, I just didn't feel that there was a cohesive plot beyond boy meets girl, girl thinks of boy as little brother, other girl likes boy, boy likes other girl after first girl is deemed unapproachable. By the time we got to the suspense of the plot, it was over sixty percent into the book. Ms. Brockmann seemed to load the front of the book with moments, the last with suspense plot and it just wasn't cohesive for me."
1,Wish I had waited for the reviews!!,"I loved Suzanne Brockman's other books so much that they are on my keeper shelf and I pre-ordered this one. She did her usual great job on the romance aspects but when she included graphic and horrifying serial killer sections, she ruined the book. I skip read the serial killer sections until the end where it wasn't possible to skip them and read the end. I'll never buy another one of her books until reviewed. I'm hoping she never ever does this again."
1,Be ready to fall asleep,"I have previously enjoyed all of Suzanne Brockmann's books but this one is a departure from her usual interesting fiction. I have struggled to finish it but it is so tedious with stupid situations and circumstances, I really hate it. What a yawner and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they like to be bored and frustrated."
2,Used to be a SB fan,"Suzanne Brockmann's early books were really entertaining, but I could barely bring myself to finish this one. The plots and character development in her last few books have really declined. This is the last time that I'm buying a new SB hardcover. It was not worth the price."
2,disappointing,"Compared to the other novels in this series this book was not of the same standard. The plot was predictable and the characters wooden. There was not the characer develpoement seen in earlier books. Some scenes were unlikely, even silly. This particularly applied to the dog catching episode. Ms Brockmann seemed more intent on mentioning the characters of previous books than developing a convincing story in this one. Even the short story in the rear was not up to par."
4,Better the Devil You Know...Kylie's the dancing queen.,"_Rhythm of Love_ is argubly Kylie's best set of formulaic dance/pop tunes she's recorded. Songs such as _What Do I Have To Do_ and _Shocked_ are dance pop at its best. _Finer Feelings_ is one of Kylie's best songs she's recorded to date, and it's very sensual and tender. All in all, Kylie's best formula album. But check her later works such as _Impossible Princess_ (aka) _Kylie Minogue_ and you find Kylie as a state-of-the-art, sophisticated dance artist."
2,NOT SO IN RHYTHM,I just got this cd and it really is not what I thought it would be based on the other reviews. The people who wrote these songs need to be shot!! They are terrible. They totally understate Kylie's singing ability and really don't showcase her as an artist. These songs a only great when preformed live in concert. Only get this album if you need to finish your Kylie collection.
4,Better the Kylie you Know,"""Better the Devil you Know"" is surely the albums best track. But ""Always find the time"" and ""One boy girl"" are great, too. Did you know, that this was the first album Kylie wrote lyrics for? And ""Count the days"" and ""Rhythm of love"" were written by Kylie and Stephen Bray, who also co-wrote Madonnas' ""Into the groove"", ""True blue"", ""Express yourself"" and ""Keep it together""."
4,My Little Kylie,"Uno de los mejores cds que ha sacado. Tiene las canciones que se relacionan y sus respectivas letras. Algo costoso pero vale la pena tenerlo, parece un grandes ecitos."
2,Great for a '30s movie.,"This movie shows Wayne at his ""B-movie"" best, but to the average Wayne fan, this unrealistic movie (in plot and action) is just a waste of time and money. On the other hand, it does show Wayne as a character who nobody knows about, and has an excellent and surprising ending that will get everybody who has not already seen it."
3,An okay read,"The 5 star rating and excellent price caught my attention. This was the first book I purchased on the subject of writing children's books. It's nice and thin, for easy portability, but lacks the punch I've seen in several other titles. There is some good information inside, however. I especially like the way the author points out a child's viewpoint and offers clear explanations for adults. While good instruction on writing a story and getting it publishes is here, I yearned for a little more completeness. It felt as though this was a primer on the subject instead of a true encyclopedia. I found the organization of the material to be chaotic, but it's a good beginning book.You can't beat the price, however, and if you're looking to dip your toes in the water, this is a good place to start."
2,VERY Basic,Be aware that when the author uses 'basic' in the title she really means it. It is informative enough to bring the truly clueless out of the depths of darkness but those who seek to actually write children's book-- especially fiction-- would do better to look elsewhere.
2,Not that great,"For the price, this book was not that great. I read it quickly and was dissapointed by the lack of information. Although it gave an overview of how to go about writing and publishing, it did not go into depth. If you are working on your first book, this is not the book to help you. I would buy a different book!"
2,The perfect guide for ADHD conspiracy theorists,"This is the ideal book for people who'd like to tell others that their pediatrician or child study team has it all wrong because their kid actually has heavy metal poisoning, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, bad nutrition, ineffective parenting, creative genius, or an alternative learning style.The author writes well and does offer some useful suggestions in child behavior management. However, she appears to have done only the minimal research into ADHD that is required to take snappy pot shots (often in the form of call-outs) at anything that passes for accepted wisdom in this field.No doubt there is room for debate, but there are many much more informative, more balanced resources if you are genuinely interested in helping a child diagnosed with ADHD. If, on the other hand, you want at all costs to avoid accepted medical treatment -- or are trying to undermine someone else's attempts to help a child -- this is the book for you."
2,Scare-tactics,"This book has several problems. Rather than being an informative guide, it seems to do everything it can to prevent parents from accepting a diagnosis of ADHD. While it is completely true that teachers should never suggest a specific diagnosis or threaten the parents to get the chid medicated, psychiatrists go through years of training and are fully qualified to diagnosis. Acting as though ADHD does not exist is harmful to the child, and Dr. Sonna does nothing to end the stereotypes about ADHD."
2,Biased,"I have read the majority of this particular book, and it is definitely biased against medication use in children. The author does provide some useful alternatives for managing symptoms; however, I am concerned about the multiple opinions in the book that are presented as 'facts.' I have gleaned some useful information from this book, but have decided that I need to purchase an additional, more objective resource."
1,Biased against medication,"I purchased this book because I found ""The Everything Parent's Guide to Children with Dyslexia"" very useful and unbiased. However, this book was written by a different author and clearly biased against medication. I agree that medicating children should be a last resort, however, when I read on page 141 that this author says that ""Ritalin has been called 'a chemical lobotomy' because the results are similar"" to surgical lobotomy, I lost faith in her objectivity. If you want a book to support your decision to not medicate, this book is for you. If you want an objective analysis of the alternatives, go somewhere else."
2,Skip it!!!,"I really regret buying this. It's not worth owning. Poor picture and sound quality (I could have lived with this if the content was worth while). Very superficial content. I have a large number of instructional martial arts videos and this is one of the worst. Goes over a few kicks and punches nothing u wouldn't get in your first day or two of a real class is covered. I realize this is a begginers intro video but, there are many (too many) better choices out there. The highlight was the mediocer kick boxing matches at the end of the video. They were mildy interesting or I would only have given 1 star."
4,nostalgic and dreamy :),"This is really nice music, ""climatic"", nostalgic, especially recommended for the real funs of this anime. It brings memories. In fact it is a bit different type of music from this you hear in most of the anime, maybe more European in general style (?).There are some fragments which resembles a bit the soundtrack from ""Amelia"" movie, what was some nice surprise for me, the other parts on the other hand are similar to music from Howl's Moving Castle (but just some short fragments! No waltzes here ;). There are also some vocalizations sung in French (!) I did not noticed watching the film. The only flaw is (that is why I rate it 4* not 5) that the opening and closing songs are put in short versions, I understand why (there are two other CD with Loveless music on the market:), but anyway it would be nice to have them here in longer version.[The cover art of the CD is very nice with rainbow drops in the background creating a 3D effect - not visible here in the product info :)]"
1,"SLOPPY MUSIC, POOR SOUND QUALITY","I was living in the Detroit area when Funkadelic was popular, but was not at this particular concert. About 20 years later, I bought the ""Maggot Brain"" CD, my only Funkadelic recording, which I would rate with 5 stars.While browsing a used record store, I came across the ""Live in Meadowbrook"" CD, and noticed it contained many of the tracks I liked.Unfortunately, the CD was a major disappointment. The band, for the most part, sounds scattered and fragmented. The resemblance of most of the tracks to the original studio recordings is distant. And the sound quality is such that I had to strain to hear many of the vocalizations, aside from the fact that overall, it sounded like an old reel to reel recording with little or no attempt to clean up the sound.If one is looking for a quality Funkadelic CD, they are well advised to avoid this one."
1,"Mommy, What's a Funkadelic?","Not this! The worst Funkadelic album ever features songs which were mercifully cut short (like Free Your Mind) or excessively drawn out versions of others (like All your Goodies Are Gone). There is no groove to this album, just a painfully loud drummer who could not not be more out of place. Every song is worse than it's studio original. If you have ears which can filter out bad drums- I don't - you probably can hear some good stuff by Eddie Hazel and Bernie Worrell. But why make the effort? The Funkadelic discography is huge - no need to parse this product for the infrequent jewel."
3,Love St.John,"This album is good, it contains allot of club anthems but comes off as commercial radio techno style for the greater part of the album. This is the first St.John album that I'm not very impressed with."
5,Very happy with this purchase,"I purchased this mobile as a christmas present for my new baby. I could honestly say it was one of the best decisions I've made!!She absolutely loves this. I was able to clip it to her bassinet. As suggested on the packaging, I first had the mobile turned towards the black and red pictures and now that she is almost 3 months I flipped them over and have the little stuffed toys hanging down. The music is great and almost always puts her to sleep after a short time of playing. I also purchased other Tiny love products and they have all proven to be terrific!!!Unfortunately the weather has been so bad this winter Ihavent taken her out much in the car so have not had the opportunity to try this out with the car seat but Im sure it will work wonders."
4,"Great musical mobile (if you ignore the ""Clip and Go"" part)","This is a great toy that captures and holds the baby's attention for a while (about 5 mins at a time). We thought the music sounded a bit ""tinny"" when we got it, but the baby seems to like it anyway. She was mesmerized by the spinning black and white pictures when she was a month or two old, and tries to reach for the spinning soft toys now that she's a few months older. We've used it for several months (probably a grand total of several hours), and have not had to change the batteries yet.The only concern with this is that it is a bit heavy, and the clip and velcro don't seem like they can take the weight for long. We end up holding it in front of or above her instead of attaching it to the handle--this gets tiring after a while."
5,Best money ever spent!,"This mobile is awesome and has literally saved my butt with my 4 month old. Our daughter is mesmerized with anything that moves and plays music. The traditional car seat toys were not doing much for her and I looked everywhere for a mini mobile to take with us and attach to all sorts of things for her. This is the perfect one and as far as I know, the only mini travel mobile around. She loves it and is instantly occupied. The music isn't overbearing and has a mute feature as well. Can't say enough good things about this toy!! Best money spent in a while!"
4,Great for young babies,"My daughter loved this mobile, especially when she was between the ages of 2 months-6 months. Now that she is just over 6 months, she still likes it, but it does not keep her attention as much as it used to. But overall, I think it is a great product!"
5,Fabulous Fabulous Fabulous,"This is a fabulous invention. I give it to all of my friends who have babies. Several friends who have multiple children, four or more, have commented that they thought they had everything until it arrived in the mail. Their only wish is that they knew about it when they had their first child. My son loved it. We would use it when we traveled to clip on the pack-n-play or crib. It is very durable, we inherited ours from my nephew. It will last through many children, even when my son was able to hold on to the little animals while I was driving the mobile never broke. Cannot highly recommend this enough."
5,Great portable baby mobile - great for playards,"It is exactly what I was looking for. Since playards have this colorless static mobiles, I wanted a light mobile to replace it, and the Tiny Love Clip and Go worked GREAT!... my daughter loves it since day 1, it plays continuous music, and is cute as well."
1,Pretty but really bad product,"This is very cute but the music doesn't work. It works as soon as you get it and then turn it off, when it goes back on the music doesn't work anymore. This is the second one I've received and the same thing happens. Too bad because my baby really loved it. Very frustrating!"
5,Best thing to keep the little one occupied,"I love this product, my little one HATES the carseat but this keeps him occupied. He loves looking at the red and black characters on the mobile."
1,Disappointed,"When I saw this product on line I thought it would be great for my son's stroller. He loves to look up and watch mobiles. When I received this product, I realized it was VERY heavy. When I attached it to the stroller it was basically laying on him. I did not use this product at all!"
3,Not good,"Not happy with this product. I bought it hoping to use it on a play pen or portable crib. The clip that attaches it makes it swing into the edge of either of those and keeps it from spinning. When I used it on my daughter's carseat, as suggested, it swung into her face. I also don't like that it doesn't ever shut off (most mobiles do shut off after 10-15 minutes).That being said, I found that if you remove the clip by pulling the velcro, I was able to use the velcro to attache it to a crib. And the music is nice, so it's not a total loss."
3,Uauthorized But Interesting,"Obviously a cheaply done unauthorized release. Was looking forward to hearing a live ""Bebop Drop"", but although it's listed on the CD back cover, it's not even on the CD! So don't expect a professional package from this. Nontheless, there are a couple of tracks worth hearing."
2,not a fan,"I couldn't finish this book-the tone and the story just wasn't very engaging to me. The protagonist wasn't very likeable, as were the other characters and the story wasn't very interesting. I couldn't get into it by 3/4 of the way through, so I just gave up. I know this is supposed to be a classic, and I would try to read another one of his books and give this writer another chance-but this one was not my favorite."
1,An Award Winner???,"""Nowadays when a person lives somewhere, in a neighborhood, the place is not certified for him. More than likely he will live there sadly and the emptiness which is inside him will expand until it evacuates the entire neighborhood. But if he sees a movie which shows his very neighborhood, it becomes possible for him to live, for a time at least, as a person who is Somewhere and not Anywhere."" What the heck does this mean? This is pretty much how the book went. The writing style was choppy, lots of tangents. There is humor in there, but you have to dig for it. ""I think it over Gregory Peckishly..."" Ha! I could not relate to the characters. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen and it never did. This book actually won the National Book Award. Figures. I can not understand why."
1,Dreary and Dull,"I read this book because it was recommeded by Phillip Yancy, whose books I find thought provoking and entertaining. However, The Moviegoer left me feeling depressed and it was a chore to read through to the end because of the book's slow pace. The main character struggles with the feeling that life is meaningless and seeks cheap thrills to put off his feelings of malaise. Yet, the book leaves you with the impression that the author struggled with the same feelings and never found the answer to his discontent. However, there is a God in Heaven who loves us and put us here for a purpose - to love others. I regret spending time reading a book whose theme is contrary to our purpose in life."
2,Boring and monotonous,"A boring, monotonous book with a poorly defined main character and essentially absent plot. Attempt to psychology, which ends up to be replaced by boring writing."
4,My first Walker Percy book,"Not sure I got the most out of this, but want to try another. I think I'll get into his philosophical exploration of life."
5,"If You Got To Ask, There Ain't No Use Explaining","Book groups beware -- Alfred Knopf thought this book was the vilest trash; if you aren't aware of the possibility of the search, you may too. I've read ten or twenty thousand books in my life. Every two or three years I return to The Moviegoer. Unlike every other book of my youth, it's twice as wise as it was thirty years ago. Put Binx's book in my hand when it's time for me to go. Not for five minutes will I be distracted from the wonder."
2,Overrated,"The early pages of this book lead the reader to believe that Binx is going to embark on a real search for meaning in life. This promises thought-provoking pages to come, but the novel quickly disintegrates into a dull collection of unimportant, disconnected, and senseless scenes. Some readers will say, ""That's the POINT!"", and it just may be. Nonetheless, I was sorely disappointed by this one, particularly after hearing all the hype. Reading about one's search would be great, but only if the individual has actually made some progress and learned something along the way. Skip it."
2,Boring,This book is boring. I did not come to like the protagonist nor understand why he did what he did.
2,Self-Absorbed Ramblings,I just could not get into this. I found Binx Bolling's alienation from the world a bit tiresome even though I admired the social questions that Percy poses throughout.
4,"It really is ""Catcher in the Rye"" for adults!","The moviegoer is the story of a man who manages to put off questioning his life decisions until his 30th birthday, when they all come into question. After a life time of attempting to distinguish himself through mediocrity in a family of over acheivers, he embarks on an internal search for spirituality, while simultaneously denying this spirituality exists. While searching for some meaning in his life, he categorically dismisses any meaning others have found in their own lives. Some readers have noted that the references to popular movies in the book date it, but I think the themes are relevant in any snapshot of time, and this overwhelms any pop culture dating. This book will capture your attention quickly, and leave you sad at having come to it's end."
3,Moviegoer is deep,"The moviegoer by Walker Percy forces the reader to reflect upon what one truly finds important in life. The reader will no doubt find heir thoughts wandering as they consider what is near and dear to them. While the book was slow at times, it is a thought provoking read."
2,"Well written, but dated and the characters are a bit dull","This seemed pretty weak to me overall. While Percy's prose style is definitely original, I found it next to impossible to care about the malaise of a Genteel, mid century Louisianan. Maybe this thing seemed to have a commanding vision of American life circa 1960, but its hard to read it now and not find it feeble, even impotent at times. Binx's personal crisis just feels hopelessly watered down. It sure doesn't have that sense of desperation and intense yearning which still make works by Camus and Dostoyevsky so compelling."
2,I Don't Get it,"Maybe I'm missing something but I don't see what the fuss is about. This book is almost readable and you have to read through pages and pages of dullness to get to the few tidbits that have value. Maybe in 1961~ this book was unique and offered a fresh perspective on life, but it doesn't stand the test of time. Not for me anyway. You should have to read 220 pages before getting to the meaning. I'm not sure how this was published and I'm not sure why it won book awards. Just because something is ""deep"" doesn't mean its good or has value."
1,A Contrary View,"My book group has a real problem with this book. Instead of celebrating Walker Percy's intellectualism, we felt that the storyline was vacuous and insipid. The characters were flat and seemed self absorbed and separated from the human condition. We couldn't feel anything for these people. Binx was totally devoid of passion, a disappointment to eager readers. Our dislike for the book did inspire a lot of discussion in search of any merit."
1,Warning: Your Mind May Wander,"It's interesting how some people see this as one of the great books of all times and others of us believe it was a waste of our time. Does that mean those of us who hated this book are less intelligent? I don't think so. I've read many ""deep"" books and found much to comtemplate. But I just couldn't keep my mind on ""The Moviegoer"" or find a reason to care about his plight.If my book club always chose books like this, I'd quit. I have so many other books I really want to read. It distresses me to put those aside and trudge through ones such as this."
3,Existential angst in the Big Easy,"Although the author is an excellent wordsmith, the novel is largely a chore to read. There is no real plot, just alot or rambling introspection. I suspect there is a measure of crypto-autobiography in the book. Unless, you enjoy vicarious despair,your time would be better spent watching a Clint Eastwood movie."
1,Couldn't get through it,"Something about this book rubbed me the wrong way. I couldn't get past page 80. The book felt slow, and very dated. The writing wasn't outstanding, the characters weren't all that interesting, the plot wasn't very dramatic...it was just kind of...nothing."
2,Disconnected,The only thing going for this work is that it is short. The book tries unsuccessfully to link Binx's worthless life into something profound. Not so for this reader.
3,Good.,"This booked grabbed me with in the first few pages. I loved Percy's voice in Binx and looked forward to the search. My only complaint is that for every one of Binx' priceless observations there were long, sometimes confusing passages which never seemed to pay off. However, the ending was so subtle and beautifully written that it more than made up it."
3,Only recommended for the genre,"If you wish to get a better handle of the general premise, your best bet is to read the reviews noted on this page. The book's description on the back cover does not provide an accurate account of the content. I did enjoy this book, and do understand its significance. However, the genre really isn't up my alley. Percy's prose is amazing, to say the least. His description of the environment (emotionally, socially, physically - and/or metaphysically) is almost Shakespearean. A technically brilliant writer."
4,Hmmm....,"What a strange assortment of characters... Binx Bolling, a meek New Orleans stockbroker, definitely lives in his own little world, and I'm not sure if I'm better off for having seen inside of it. It's a little disturbing, but there are moments when I agreed perfectly with how he felt. That's scary!I'm not sure if I can recommend this book. It is very good. It is different. It is disturbing. You make the call."
4,Lots of fun,"This movie should be taken for just what it is - lots of fun. The movie is certainly not rocket-science; it's a melodramatic (a now a bit camp) piece with Margaret Lockwood playing a female highwayman (highwaywoman?), and also stars James Mason and Patricia Roc. A nice bit of fluff for 104 minutes!"
3,nice patterns,"There were some great patterns in this book, however, I would like a more understandable pattern book. It had a lot of household items that I have way too many patterns for already."
4,Bicycle Mirrors,"Finally found mirrors that work on the handle bars of my recumbent trike; I bought a pair and I now have great rear-view vision on both sides. Only one problem, the clamp is too small for most handlebars; fortunately I had a pair from another set of mirrors that worked."
4,Pyramid Pro Delux 9 Inch Bicycle Mirror,The Mirror is easy to install and provides good vision. Needs better adjustment for tightening once positined.
3,Good but...,"The mirror is beauty and strong but...This is what I did: I put a rubber stripe to have a good grab in the handlebar (didn't bring it). Also I did drill a small hole and put a screw with nut through the upper nut, if not the mirror will be getting loose and loose and loose. And I did put an extra nut to keep tight the lower nut.To me, it is the best but need a little extra work."
5,Sunlite Deluxe Bicycle Mirror,My husband bought this for his motorized bicycle and loves it. He wanted a bigger mirror. I would recommend this to anyone.
1,Clamp is Too Flimsy for the Size of the Mirror,This mirror needs a much sturdier clamp for its size. I think the mirror is great but not much good to me if I can not mount it effectively.
4,Basic ballet shoe with an annoying bow,"This is a basic shoe, perfect for beginning ballerinas. It's much better than many of the slipper styles I've seen at certain low-price shoe retailers where you pay less. It runs true to size and is easy to slip on and off.The bow on the top refuses to stay tied, so I am going to cut it off instead of continuing the ""retie every 3 minutes"" battle."
4,ballet shoe review,"These Ballet shoes have worked great for my preschooler. They fit great and seem very durable. They do untie easily, but I'm guessing thats a ballet shoe issue?"
2,Way too small!,I should have read the reviews. We measured according to Amazon's shoe size chart and she cannot even get her feet into them let alone wear them. Very disappointing and shame on Amazon.
2,Not Happy,The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old.
4,"Great quality shoes, sizing confusion!","So I read many of the reviews here that cover the sizing confusion. I ordered a size too large and well, they are a size too large! I am now ordering a second pair so that my daughter will have well fitting ballet shoes in time for class on Monday. Moral of the story, sometimes it helps to read reviews and sometimes it does not.These are well made shoes, good quality leather. I like Capezio products, these are almost identical to the ballet shoes I wore as a child about 30 years ago when I started ballet at age 5. Nice to see that some things never change and the quality is still important to the people at Capezio. Thanks!"
4,Happy with purchase,"I had to return the first pair because even though they were the size my daughter wears in a regular shoe, they were too small. I had to order a full size larger than what she wears in all her other shoes. Maybe that's how ballet shoes run? Other than that, I'm happy with the purchase. They came quickly... as did the second pair (when I asked for an exchange). They arrived in two days. The quality seems good. My daughter has worn them one time."
3,"Nice quality, size runs small","The size runs small. My daughter wears a size 6 in shoes so I ordered a 6 in this shoe too, however it was way too small. Couldn't even get on her foot. It seems a 6 in this shoe is equivalent to her other size 4 shoes.The quality seems good though if you how their sizes run."
2,Sizing is crazy...,"Our dance instructor measured my daughter's feet. Of course she lost one slipper right away.. So I ordered the same size through Capezio. When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe! That's how large it was. So I figured ""okay, different company, maybe different fit"" and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller. Same thing. Actually nearly no difference between the two. They really need to advise people of their fit. Which foot measurement equals each shoe size. I'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair. Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size. And also, I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor."
2,Wrong size!,"If you already know what size to buy, the quality of the shoe appears just fine. (Hence the 2 stars) I ordered my child's street shoe size, as suggested in some other reviews, and they are at least 2 sizes too small. I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras, or going to a store for your dancer's first pair. My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited."
4,Great looking shoe...sizing confusion,When ordering this shoe I knew that the sizing would be hit or miss...it happens when ordering online. My daughter wears a size 10.5 to 11 and I wanted to be sure that she would have a shoe that fits but I think I should have ordered closer to her street size.
3,A little on the small side,"I purchased these for my grand daughter when she starts ballet classes. While they arrived quickly (Prime), I was disappointed to see that they JUST fit her even though we ordered them a size bigger and extra wide. I guess the Chinese have smaller feet?? Yes, I pick on the Chinese,,,,,, for good reason.Anyway, the shoes are really cute and are functional so I can't complain about that. She looks good in them."
3,Hi,"Regards, I have not realized the comment of the purchase, due to the fact that I have had problems with the company in charge of the transport to my country, in all that it comes, I him guarantee that he will think"
1,AWFUL,"THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE. I ORDERED AN 11m, WAY TOO BIG, ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL, ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M, ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING. COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DON'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER!"
3,Seems to run small,"Nice shoe, but definitely not true to size. My daughter currently wears 8 (toddler) in ""regular"" shoes, so I ordered a size 9 thinking she would grow into them. Her toe is right on the edge, so she won't be wearing them long."
4,My Daughter loves it..,"And she uses it every single week for her ballet dance classes. They are snug and slip on easily on her little foot, and she can do it all by herself... exactly what they are meant to be ..."
2,Cute shoe but terrible sizing,"I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class. The shoe is very pretty, but the sizing is way off. I ordered her a size bigger, but it was still far too tight, and as her feet are pretty narrow, it was also way too wide. I returned this slipper (in the end, it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping) and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit."
5,pretty ballet shoes,"I got this ballet shoes for my 4 year old, she loved them but you really have to buy one or even two sizes bigger,I ended up buying 2 pairs because the first ones were too small for her. So make sure you buy 1 or 2 sizes bigger, they grow so fast anyway!! The shoes are very soft and it has an elastic band to make them fit their feet."
5,Great ballet shoe for my tiny dancer,"We originally purchased these in a specialty dance shop. When it came time for the next size, Amazon's price was awesome. My 4-year old's feet are narrow, and these were a perfect fit (we got the Narrow style). You can tighten them a little by pulling and tying the string, and the elastic band that goes over the top of her foot isn't too tight or too loose. The shoe holds up great, the color is nice (we have pink), and my little ballerina loves them! You usually can't go wrong with Capezio dance products. Make sure you try them on in a local store before purchasin, so that you get the correct size & don't waste money on shipping a return."
1,go two sizes up!,"I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class, and I bought 1 size bigger just in case. It was far too tight for her feet! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe, so be weary! If you buy it for your little toddler, be sure to go up at least two sizes!"
3,"Good price, okay shoes","These shoes were good for the price, however I like the ABT brand at Payless better. They are a darker pink which is a plus for a 5 year old and they have a snugger fit. My daughter doesn't have a narrow foot so I ordered the medium width. They were still too wide for her feet and using the draw strings only helped a little. I returned these shoes. If you can get the right size (without being able to try them on first) and the lighter color is ok for you, these would be great, especially for well under $20."
5,Perfect Twinkle Toes,"This was perfect for the 3 year old's first ballet class. She looked like a perfect little ballerina. Only problem, as with most shoes with ties for kids that age is that come undone easily."
1,Ballet Shoe,"This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we couldn't use. I returned for another size, went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes. Ballet shoes that hurt her toes! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size. We were wrong."
4,run very small,These shoes seem to be really high quality but my daughter wears a 6 I ordered a 7 to be safe and they came EXTREMELY small. I know her foot didn't grow because all of her other size 6 shoes still fit well. I had to re-order a larger size so her little toes aren't crunched.
4,Toddler Ballet Shoes,I got the shoe a half size bigger for a little room to grow and they still stay on just fine. My daughter unfortunately unties the front laces a lot -- which of course is decoration and not really for anything else -- so I might purchase ballet shoes without laces next time but that does not detract from the good quality of this shoe. It seems to me that they are made with the same high quality as a woman's ballet slippers. I recommend them.
2,Sizing off despite measuring,"So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off. I measured my daughter's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested. Her foot measures a little less than 6"", which would be between size 8 and 8.5. I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still didn't fit!! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon. The shoes itself only measure 5.75"" which is not what the sizing info states for size 9. Her big toes are curled up inside. So now, we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon, it's not their fault. Really cute shoes, but yeah, the sizing is like playing roulette, you never know what you would get!"
4,Was worried about size but it turned out okay,"I was very apprehensive about buying these after reading all of the reviews, but decided to take a chance because they were such a great price. I ordered half a size up (8M instead of 7.5M)to play it safe. I debated about ordering them in wide because my daughter's feet tend to be wide but surprisingly enough, I'm glad I didn't because they seemed loose on the sides so I had to tighten them with the string. They do fit, and maybe I could have even gone with her street shoe size, but they're not loose enough to warrant exchanging. The only thing that I took a star off for is that the string doesn't seem to tie very tightly so I wonder if that's going to get annoying."
1,terrible sizing,I never write reviews but felt like I should this time. I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger. They are still too small. Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them. Not worth it. I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on.
2,"Cute, but WRONG SIZING!",I thought I did my homework before purchasing these... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed. They were still way too small. I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with. They returned them free of charge.
2,Not true to size,"I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old (her normal size). The shoes looked really nice, but they were way too small (at least, a size smaller then expected, and probably more). I returned the shoes. Had to pay for shipping, but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping (saved about $2). I would've gotten another pair, but I'm afraid it will not fit either, since it's hard to determine what size would be appropriate, and I don't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back. If you know exactly which size fits your kid, I would recommend the shoes, but if you don't, try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would."
4,Order normal size,"After reading the reviews, I did as suggested and order a size up. Do not order a size up...order your regular shoe size."
5,Good quality ballet shoes.,We have two young daughters in ballet and they have only used Capezio Ballet shoes. They are a very good quality shoe and we havn't had any problems with any of them. The Dance studio we go to highly recommends these shoes and all the dancers there use them.
4,"So far, awesome!","Got these for my daughter for Christmas. The leather is nice and supple, they fit well, and adjust easily. Don't yet know how well they'll hold up, but I think they'll still be in great condition after she outgrows them."
3,Too small!,I measured my daughters foot and ordered the correct size for her however the shoes were way too small. The entire shoe was smaller than my daughter's bare foot! I would say to order at least a size bigger.
3,sizing,"They run extremely small. Our granddaughter just got into a size 6, so I ordered a 6 1/2 and they weren't even close to fitting. Had to return and go with a 7 1/2. Other than that they are great."
3,Ballet shoes not true to size.,"The ballet shoes are very nice, but not true to size. My granddaughter (age 4) wears a size 7, I ordered a 7.5 to give her room to grow, and they were too small! Some advice about the sizing would have been helpful. Now we have to send them back."
4,Size was right,The size was right. Don't buy too big. 2.5 size are 2.5 size. Shoes themselves look good.Colour good like other shoes you see/
4,Good quality with good price,"This was the 1st Capezio I bought for my 7 yr old. The material, color and workmanship are all very nice, better than most of the previous ballet shoes she has. I read many reviews before I purchased and I decided to go with one and a half size larger due to experiences from other reviewers but it turned out that they are exactly 1- 1/2 sizes too big. However I did make a right decision to buy it Narrow because its ""Narrow"" is equal to ""Medium"" of regular shoes. I'll keep this Capezio for later use. I'll buy Capezio again for quality and price despite the size and width is hit or miss."
1,Only received one refund on two returns,"received these, 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance, way too small. REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair. Very upset and dissapointed."
4,Nice product but runs very small,The product arrived on time and in good condition however the shoe is very small. Order at least a size or more larger. I had to return them.
2,Sized small,"Ordered these for daughter. She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them, and had small feet because she was not a big kid (still isn't). She couldn't even get her little foot into the size 6. However, when we got a size 6 from Payless, she fit in them just fine. Returning this pair would have been a hassle, so we just kept them and learned our lesson. At 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 years old, a $10 Payless pair is just fine. And you can return with no hassle if they don't fit. Live and learn, Mommy!"
2,"Way, way too small.","We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on. It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black. These, however, were very tiny for the size."
4,"Good quality, runs small.",Capezio shoes have always been made well. These ran a bit small so I ordered the next 1/2 size up for my daughter.
1,Shoes run unbelievably small!!,"My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe. I ordered this shoe two different times; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8. both were far from fitting! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind. my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you. with shipping cost, the money you ""save"" is not worth it. do not buy."
4,Shoe Reveiw for non-professional use,"This is leather, and fine quality. Band is wider than some - will stay on at least. My 5 yr old has med width feet, size 10 in a shoe. This 10.5 was a little roomy even with the drawstring pulled, but for non-professional use, she will grow into in quickly. Is that traditional tan/pink color."
3,Too wide,"True to size but really wide, other wise good quality. Also nice pink color. I don't recommend them unless your are in need of some width."
2,SIZING INCORRECT,"these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant. My 2 yr old has a small foot, but i still ordered her a 6.5 (she wears a 6). it was WAY too small. I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck!"
1,The sizing issues make it REALLY NOT WORTH IT,"I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems. I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child's regular street size. Further, I've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I wouldn't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size. Well, they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand's size charts, they're way too small! And Amazon wants to charge $5 to ship them back. So really, don't be like me and think you did your homework and you'll be fine. Buy them in store. Major Amazon FAIL."
4,Seriously Large for a Ballet Shoe,"These look nicely made, but the sizing is roughly street shoe sizing, as other reviewers have noted. You could say this means ""they run true to size,"" but that's highly misleading, as ballet shoes normally run a size or so small. To repeat: they run true to *street* size, not normal ballet shoe size--at least in size 2.5. So, just be aware of that as you order or you'll be like me, shelving these shoes for a year before using them. (Luckily, girls grow, as the shoes are really not worth the time and postage to return.)"
2,Didn't fit!,"These shoes were nowhere near ""real"" size. My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler. I ordered a size 6 and I can't even get it on her foot! Make sure you order much larger than usual. I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW."
4,run small,first I ordered toddler size 7 and I couldn't even get it on my daughter's foot (she wears a size 7 shoe). I sent it back with no problem and acutally had the 8 in my possession (from Amazon) before I sent it back. The 8 fits. Get a size larger just to fit - go up even more if you are looking at room to grow.
4,"good value, good fit",I ordered a half size larger based on the sizing chart after measuring my daughters feet. She was very close to the next size and I didn't want her growing out of them too soon. She loves them and they fit well.
3,They're fine but....,"The shoes were fine overall for the price. My only gripe about the product is that the lace strings are so long. They kept on ""unknotting"" so my daughter would trip over them. I finally had to cut the strings off."
5,excellent,Our daughter is a dancer and its cheaper and easier to order her items online. These shipped fast and are holding up great!
2,"Nice quality, size is WAY OFF","I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter's size - she wear 7, I ordered 8.5. Guess what - it didn't even fit her foot. I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store (8.5 also), and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller. I am returning them. Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off."
3,Cute slippers...but sizing is WAY off...,"I realize dance slippers run small, so I ordered my niece an ENTIRE size up from her normal. Still way too small. I would seriously recommend you order a size, maybe even two sizes up from what your little one normally wears.."
4,Excited for my kids,I was very excited to discover these books at the store. For years I enjoyed reading the Little House books. Recently I started reading them to my little gils and I am very excited we have other books to enjoy.
3,"This book is not of the same quality as the ""Little House"" b","These books do not even come close to the ""Little House"" books. This is not surprising when you consider that Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote first hand about her own life and Maria D. Wilkes is writing about the life of someone for whom the only written record in existence is the one written by her daughter, Laura Ingalls Wilder. The Roger McBride series comes much closer to the timeless quality of the ""Little House"" books."
5,Wow,"Such a tight band. Total Immortal is a real nitro-charged masterpiece. The songs on this CD bear repeated listens, and you'll probably find yourself listening to this CD more than ones with 3 times the songs. If you love AFI, you can't go wrong, but even if you're more of a casual music listener, you'll still find something on this album to enjoy. Good stuff. Great lyrics, good guitar work, etc. etc. etc. I could go on...."
5,"I may not own it, but i love it","My freind owns this disk and i love it! Support AFi by buying their discs, Dont download it ""free"".Being a total audiophile i love music, AFi always suprises me with their disks, every one of them pulling a new trick out of the bag. Diffrent tones, themes, and sounds makes me look to their next cd for more. of course all bands have their hits, and some of these may not have ranked at all, but i appriciate every song for its individual changes.After you spend time learning about music, and have a trained ear, you'll learn to love those little changes in music. Especialy AFi's"
4,Great,"This is AFI's second EP, and most likely the best. The covered Holloween song from the Misfits is great, and the other tracks are good too. A good thing is that the price for this CD is not bad at all, for if you want to buy something else, and you got a little bit of dough on you. I gave it 4 stars though because, this CD is a little, weird. Like with the song Fall Children, it just freaked me out when I read the lyrics. So go and buy this CD anywhere you can, for it is good and worth it. Check out my reviews with the other AFI albums."
5,an afi starter cd,this is a great cd to start listening to afi. ...it's got great songs such as a cover of the misfits classic halloween.fall children:9/10good song but i dislike the introhalloween:10/10my favorite on the cd. only problem is al the [stuff] that they have after the songthe boy who destroyed the world:10/10amazing song.featured on THPS 3totalimmortal:10/10perfect song to describe afi.it has the signature afi sound. this song was later covered by the offspring.great cd. so buy it and be swep away into the world of AFI
3,Save your money just download the songs,"Of the three AFI cds I own this is the only one that really dissapointed me. I can't really say that the songs were bad just that after hearing Sing The Sorrow I expected more from their past projects. I would suggest that you save yourself $8.00 and download the songs.Fall Children-2/5 It's okay but the lyrics seem kinda weak.Halloween-2/5 Once again it's okay but I think there's so many bands that try to copy what The Misfits did, even if AFI was one of the first (so I've been told) they need to try to do thier own thing.The Boy Who Destroyed The World-4/5 In my opinion this is one of thier best songs lyrically.Totalimmortal-3/5 A pretty catchy song it had me singing along with the chorus after I heard it a few times.This cd might have gotten four stars if it was more than thirteen minutes long. I'm really glad that Davey stepped it up a notch on ""Sorrow"" I think they need to get away from the whole carbon-copy of The Misfits thing and forge thier own path."
5,Dark and Fun!,"I enjoy the way A.F.I combines elements of both punk and hardcore, but ""All Hallows E.P"" is like somthing out of 20 years ago. The album is dark, yet catchy. I can tell this is the direction of AFI, and if so, I like it. Davey has some of the best pipes on a punk singer Ive ever seen. And, why does everyone compare them to the Offspring, these guys sound more like old school punkers like The Misfits (only way better) and Black Flag. Any punk should pick this E.P up."
4,Halloween is worth it.,"Great EP , all the songs are awesome especially halloween and total immortal. it's usually cheap too like 5 bucks or so."
4,time for tea,"I ordered this cup and saucer along with several others of these Royal Albert collectibles and am quite satisfied with each of the patterns. They are all lovely. The background colors are bright and unique and the roses are the color and quality I expect from Royal Albert. Each were well packaged and arrived in perfect condition. I withheld the final and 5th star because they are a bit pricey but obviously didn't let that deter me. All things considered, this items adds a lot to a spot of tea."
3,Quality Change,"Although I do think this cup is attractive, I was replacing an old Royal Albert and the quality has changed. It is not as delicate and I noticed that it is now made in China."
2,Royal Albert collectible Tea cup and Saucer,"I got this item and was not impressed. I opened the box to find the saucer was broken in about 4 pieces. I don't know how the tea cup stayed in one piece, because it was not rapped in bubble rap or peanuts,They had just put paper around the inside of the box. How's that going to protect anything? The saucer got thrown around in the box. A pretty set ,but I was not impressed with the rapping, it was that of a slacker."
4,"Great Sound, Quality Control Lacking","These are a great set of headphones but a little finicky. On my set, the 3.5mm plug isn't wired particularly well so I end up having to wiggle the very end of the plug to get stereo. After that, they sound great. I'll probably have to have the end reterminated. Other than that, they are a great set of cans. Very comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. Being a college student, I find myself reaching for them a lot either when I need to drown out the background noise of the dorm or when my roommate needs to study. I can wear them for a couple hours and be fine. Even with no equalization (which is my preference) these are very accurate. Treat these headphones well and they will pleasure your ears."
5,What a Blessing!,"I have to say, I have read MANY books, and not found the information provided in this class setting DVD. Peter teaches the class so well that you feel like you are actually there! Having said that, the information he provides is in a well thought out order. Peter reminds us that we don't have to buy fancy stones or rocks to be effective, and that what we find in nature is more valuable to us. Using his techniques and advice you will go you far. His ethical stance and honesty about the use of these items, and the combination of mixing them, and using oils and crystals in your spell work is down to earth and refreshing. I can't wait to put it all to good use! He has opened the door for you, you only need to walk through it. Thank you for a much needed class on such a wonderful subject.Sincerely, Chris"
5,An incredible resource!,"Not only is it the most comprehensive directory of venture capital firms I have been able to find, but it is also well organized with a valuable introduction. Thumbs up."
5,Get Ready to Fight Back!,"Being Christian is not an easy life. When a child of God finally makes their confession of faith, Satans workload gets larger, but the believer is his prime target for all his powerlessness. His work consists of extinguishing the believer and all that he or she can effect for God through whatever weaknesses he can find. This short book helps the reader realize why things have or have not been so smooth in their transition from unbeliever to believer. It will wake you up! When God opens doors we're supposed to walk through them; walk through this book and you'll never regret that you were reading instead of mowing the lawn or checking your email. God bless!"
5,Fantastic,I lived in this city for a short time and love the area. Quaint little town Always something to do their. Friendly atmospher and lots of hills to walk up and down.
2,Somewhere between Judge Dredd and Punisher,"I truly enjoyed Punisher Max and was checking out earlier Ennis stuff. The problem is that one has to lower expectations here. This is more like Punisher/Dillon, with dark humor. Except that it doesn't quite come off as humor. More like slapsthick. For example, the guy who mated with a mutated organism and is now bloated like a furball, what's funny about that? Even in an imaginary fantasy-filled world, this imagery doesn't make sense as all other protagonists have normal shaped phenotypes. The humor is more like dank humor, stale, as the captain tosses out his followers from the doomed plane in order to save his own skin. Or the fact that the pilgrim is a cannibal, and he induces the others to feast like him when the chips are down. You could see that coming a mile away.Perhaps it is difficult to judge this issue fairly, coming as one did from Punisher Max. One goes back to the source, and finds the water tepid."
1,Story line sucks,"Again comics are going over the top with their story lines. I went into this book thinking that it was going to be Jonah Hex meets Mad Max, but it was not. I read the first and second chapter and had it with the book. Thank God for my buddy who bought the book off me."
5,LHOP Season 2,"I would love to have this one,maybe in the near to distant future. My favorites are Troublemaker and In The Big Inning[The Millers,Mulligans,The Walnut Grove Heavenly Hosts[That Reverend Alden!] The Merchants,one of my favorite scenes is when Charles and Caroline are in Bed eating popcorn and Charles laughs,talking about Doc Baker,Nels Oleson,Lars Hanson and Rev Alden arguing about the name of the baseball team."
5,"Finally, Uncut After All These Years!","I am so glad these episodes are finally on DVD! I grew up watching this series first-run, so I remember scenes and lines of dialogue that are cut out when they're shown in syndication. It's like watching a brand-new show to watch these uncut episodes, because I've had to watch them in syndication for so long! I think they are just great; it's nice to re-visit my childhood this way!"
5,Great collection,"We have only watched the first DVD so far in the season, but it is already great! I recommend this for all ""Little House"" lovers!"
5,Little House Dreamset,I bought this to use in my classroom to show my kids what life was like on the frontier. I am keeping these for future classes as well as my personal use. I had forgotten just how much I enjoyed Little House on the Prairie as a child. These DVDs brought back memories of watching the show on our old black and white TV.
1,Disappointed,Just tried it last weekend. The fist two DVD's have skips and glitches. Didn't even bother with the rest. Need to send it back.
5,"gave it as gift to others, they asked someone to get it for them, they really liked it",gave it as gift to others (they asked someone to get it for them) they said they really liked it
1,DVD Condition,The DVD's were good until we got to the last one and it skips.I will not order from this company again.
5,Great series,I got the complete season 2 of Little House on the Prairie for my grandson who is 9 years old. He had never seen any of the TV shows. I love the message the shows portray. I picked season 2 because of that reason. He absolutely loves each DVD. Now I can get him a different season on his birthday and next Christmas until he has the entire collection. Thanks to Amazon for having the best prices out there.
3,technical defect on disc #6 of season 2,"I purchased 2 of the LHOP, season 2 box sets. Both sets have video & audio defects on disc 6, 31 minutes into the disc."
3,"Great series, OK Box Set","There has been two different kinds of box sets for the lhotp.When you are buying the series and you like the fold out type of box sets, make sure you buy the ones from imavision.This was the box set from lionsgate, which is just a plastic box with a cardboard cover.Gave it a three star because of that, the content is worth a 5 star without a doubt."
1,Sound Quality,"I have 4 each DVDs of 'Little House on the Prairie', the Pilot, Season 1, 2, & 3. The 'sound' quality of all these DVDs is very poor !!!!I have to turn the volume control on my TV as high as it will go and there are still sections in which I can not hear or distinguish what is being said."
3,Disappointed,I bought these beacause of a similar pair I had. These are pointy toes and not very comfortable.
5,Excellent show,"I remember this show sounded interesting when it came out, but I never got around to watching it. I bought it now because I have become a fan of Simon Baker (what can I say), and I'm glad I did. This is a well-written show with excellent acting all around. I just watched 2 episodes in a row and was riveted by the human drama. And yes, Simon Baker captures the character perfectly."
5,Wanting more,"Great season, great acting and story line. Wanting more!!! Looking forward to season 2 and 3. Hoping that the remainding seasons are being generated NOW. Everyone will enjoy such a great storyline. Simon Baker and the other actors are fantastic. Come on seasons 2 and 3, I am ready to make the purchase. Thanks for a great season."
3,Not the Mentalist,"My wife and I love Simon Baker in ""The Mentalist,"" so we thought we'd give ""The Guardian"" a try. It's entertaining, but like a lot of lawyer shows, it started growing old after a while. Simon Baker's ""Guardian"" character is not as funny and loveable as in ""The Mentalist."" He's a little more dour and serious."
5,Loved the guardian,Just finished The Guardian. All three seasons and I am sad it is over. Really excellent in every category. You will also enjoy Doc Martin.
3,Subtitles?!,The Guardian: The First SeasonI'm very sorry because apparently there are no subtitles. I need portuguese subtitles. Thank you very much anyway.
1,The Guardian / simon baker,"If there is anything worse than throw a story out there and not resolving it or closing it, I can easily see why this series didnt make it. You get interested in the plot (one of many) and they just drop it. Nothing said about the story at all they just move on to another story line... frankly, all the praise for this series is very misguided. I'm tell you now it sure ain't no MENTALIST"
5,Young Simon Baker,"Well written, powerful characters. Simon Baker and Dabney Coleman are a perfect father - son combo. I didn't discover this series until this year. I just wish it had run for more season."
5,The Guardian,This show is full of very interesting drama. Simon Baker and the rest of the crew showed great acting abilities that are very believable.
3,Too Cheesy to be Terrifying,"This CD started out strongly, with the frenzied music of ""Cast into the Unfathomable Deeps"" leading nicely into the pounding ""Born in Flames."" After that, everything just sort of goes down hill. ""Battle of the Ancient Warriors,"" while a fairly good song, is riddled with bad grammar and structure, sounding as if a five-year old wrote it. That was a fairly common problem throughout the album. ""Woeful Summoning"" doesn't help matters much, with Kristin's vocals having a disappointingly cheesy sound. That really sums up Ancient's problem. They try to come off as mystical, terrifying creatures, but everything they do is so cheesy and cliched, they fail miserably. Their own bloated self image doesn't help matters any. They only end up looking like comical, B-movie villians. Don't get me wrong, their music does have its moments, but Ancient could stand to improve in many areas."
5,Everlasting God,"Absolutely love the music, lyrics, and worship through modern music brought out in this CD. Brenton Brown brings a standard in modern day worship music that sets a standard for others to follow! What a blessing to God!"
4,Good singable worship songs,Brenton Brown has written several worship songs that are meaningful and easy for a church to sing. I recommend this album.
2,3 RMAs in less than 3 months!!,"maybe its just bad luck, but I've had this drive fail on me 3 times in the last few months, I'd spend a little more for a seagate next time... Reviews of this drive on other sites are not so bad. I give it 2 stars only becasue samsung has decent phone support."
1,mislead,"the cover says something to the affect no one knew what happened until he spoke... well he never spoke, i keep waiting and reading and nothing, the book ended and he never admitted anything it leaves you to read between the lines... i was very disappointed... to read the whole book and still not REALLY know what went on..."
2,This book creates more questions than it answers...,"I felt the book was lacking in depth of background information regarding aspects of the numerous relationships discussed. Many unnecessary tidbits of info are given for no apparent reason. As written, the story could have been streamlined. I would have liked more insight to the reasons why this woman stayed with her husband for so long and why none of her devoted family or friends were willing to help her children in their time of need. The 'stayed for the kids' sake' type of explanations are hollow. That man was doing nothing good for the kids as everyone knew, he wasn't supporting the family financially-quite the opposite, and everyone watched the horrible tragedy play out in slow motion.And why give fictitous names for the children of the deceased woman only to show a picture of her headstone with their real names on it?Disappointing read..."
3,Overrated,"I had high hopes for this book based on the Amazon reviews, but it didn't begin to live up to them. It's not badly written-- it just has the too-common flaws of the true-crime genre: superficiality, hero-worship, and an either/or mindset. After finishing the book, I know the facts of the case and the basic biographies of the victim and the murderer, but I still have no idea how he felt murder could solve his problems, or how she continued to reconcile herself to her marriage.The best true-crime books, I think, are the ones that make us feel as if we know the subjects, and Fanning's book fails completely in this respect."
5,Another Winner From Diane,This book lives up to her earlier works. It did not disappoint me in any way.
4,Great book but....,"This was so well written and I couldn't put it down. The only problem I have with it is the fact that the writer did not put down the boys real name to protect them, yet at the end of the book there is a picture of the headstone with their real names clearly seen."
3,Gone Forever,a moving story of true deceit. The observation of a truly demented mind thinking only they are in control and will allow no alterations to take place. The man truly thought he was only doing what was necessary. It is unbelievable that so many people could not see what was actually happening right before their eyes.
4,Cage x3,prior to this purchase i was simply looking for the title Bringing Out The Dead. then i came across this triple feature package. all movies are pretty slim as far as extra features are concerned. however these are 3 strong movies. usually with these triple feature things there is one good movie and two bad ones. so i recomend this purchase only if you don't have any of the titles. nicholas cage in three movies by three of hollywoods best directors. well maybe one of the best directors and 2 that use to be in that consideration. Bringing out the dead is in my opinion the most underated Martin Scorsese picture ill give it 4/5. the other two are good movies but just not as good they get 3/5 starts respectively.
5,Wonderful literary journey,This book is simply delightful for those who resonate with a simpler age. The product received was flawless and the customer service contact was most pleasant.
2,Very difficult to enjoy after seeing the tv series first.,"The series was so wonderful and colorful and it was ended abruptly in season 4 so I thought that if I read the books I could get better closure... Not!The series is loosely based on the books, maybe even ""inspired by"" them, and it was so much more entertaining! Character development and pertinence in the series was so much better than the books (in which, some of my favorites barely even existed.)I found the story too dull to complete."
5,beautiful book,this is a beautiful book with gorgous illustrations. It was in excellent condition.I loved the pbs series and look forward to reading this lovely book.
3,disappointed,I was really looking forward to reading this book but I found it dull and nothing like the show. Maybe I was expecting too much.
3,Lark Rise to Candleford: A Trilogy,"This is very dry reading. It is not written as a story - but as a description of life, the area, customs, and culture of a time that was in transition."
4,Good read and a good video production,"Picked this up for reading on a long international trip. A very pleasant read, highly recommended. If you like the series, try the book and vice versa."
4,simple account of a lost lifestyle,"I borrowed this book from the library. I love the illustrations, which very much enhance the story. The author reminisces about the way things were in the English countryside in the 1880's. Her accounts and descriptions might be simple, of everyday tasks that we don't think much about, but i really enjoyed learning about these details.The book i read, the ""Illustrated"" version, is an abrigment of the thre volumes. The editors say at the end that the abridgment was done mostly to avoid repetition, which exists in the three books so that they can be read independently of each other."
5,Good service,"The item arrived in good time. Although it is not a new book it is in new condtion, as was the dust jacket. I'd read the story already but since it is such an old time favorite I wantd to be able to touch the lovely cloth binding and see the beautiful old illustrations the next time I read it. I was not disapointed. You feel as if you are there in old England reading someone's letter. They loved to add pictures in the letters during that time.I never hesitate to buy old books through Amazon, snce I've never been disappointd."
1,100 series helmet face shield,The pictures are very misleading. I ordered two of these shields for my wife and myself. The pictures and the description both claim to be smoked and what we got were green tinted instead. If the picture had depicted green I never would have wasted my money. They are now collecting dust in my garage.
1,The Worst Remake Ever,"Don't waste your time or money on this trash. So much of the original Galsworthy material is discarded, distorted, or reinterpreted that the only things remaining true to the original are the title and some - not all - of the original characters. Gina McKee is completely miscast as Irenee, which alone spells doom for the production. Get the original - it's in black and white, the sets are shaky and the costumes mediocre, but the acting is brilliant and the script much closer to the book."
5,Forsyte Saga - Series 2 DVD,"I bought this after I had gotten series I - Originally I viewed it through the library and found it to be a great mini series so just had to add it to my 2000 movie collection, since this will be watched over again several times along with series 1."
5,"The Forsyte Saga, Series 2","I found the whole series, series one and series two to be wonderful, my teenage daughter and I sat for many hours together watching them, I was amazed with how much she couldn't wait to watch the next episode, The only dissapointment was when there was no more to watch"
1,could not see it on the screen,"Iam a prime customer, and wanted to watch 'The Forsyte Saga' season 2, on Amazon. I get the page where it says now playing, but I see nothing. It is very difficult to communicate with Amazon, since you can not talk with anyone, and their online help, is not helpful. I am very disappointed."
1,Poor quality streaming,"Gets stuck every 5 minutes, what a waste of time. The Saga itself is great, if only it were available on Netflix."
5,Family story continues,This is one of the best miniseries I watched. A great team of actors tell the continuing story of the aristocratic Forsyte family.
3,mui buena me gusta,"es de calidad, pero el mango de agarre no estan agudo, donde los dedo me aprietan, excelente pinza buena compra"
4,Back Cover Description,"Earth's elusive masters tolerated only one planet-wide organization - the Scarlet Order of Men. Only the most favored of the People could enter the Institute, as children, to undergo rigorous training. Those unift for the Order became Blue Brethren, servants and guides of the People, aiding and instructing them as loyal members of society, under the rule of the benvolent Trisz."
2,TERRIBLE Kindle Translation,The translation to the Kindle format was absolutely abysmal - thousands of spelling errors pretty much made this impossible to read. Save your money on this one and get the paperback instead.
4,Ski Poles,"I bought these ski poles at the end of the season, they came in the mail. So far they look good, have a great grip and I imagine they will rock next season."
4,4 stars for the quality of the pictures,"This book has no pretension to cover it all. It shows beautiful examples of the best in that field (tobacconist statues, early salt glaze, early jugs, toys...). Worth having for the collector."
3,No pronunciation shown,"This is undoubtedly an extensive dictionary and I have found words in it that I haven't been able to locate in others. Well, I need help with the pronunciation of some words and I don't get it from this dictionary. I have to refer back to my first Italian dictionary to find the pronunciation of the word. That is my only complaint. But for someone trying to learn the language, it is a fairly relevant issue."
3,Poor quality (Talking about the content!),"1. Album version (The song you've probably heard on the radio and if you turn it on you'll find it I'm sure! I used to like this song so much but the radio and the TV made me hate it) :( 2. Deep dish vocal (Love the music and the echoes all through the song although it gets a little bit repetitive and one question...WHERE's THE CHORUS?) 3. Skinny mix (The background music sounds like the ""Stan"" song but without Eminem of course although if you hear it well the vocals don't go with the music, it's weird really, kinda ruins it...) 4. Enhanced video section (Great, colorful video and she looks beautiful too bad it's on TV at least once an hour...) I liked the remixes on the ""here with me"" single but this, this is poor if compared, I think the record company thought people like would buy it just for the Album verison and just throuw some mediocre mixes and the video to match the price but anyways. Seriously, buy it if only a die-hard fan like me..."
3,"This is a great CD , but not for everyone","Thank You is an easy listening song , with amazing choir vocals in the background, which when its over leaves you wanting more. That's where the Deep Dish crew come in , with a cool , slow but dancey two-step club mix with cool echoes the whole way through , this track is the main reason I bought the CD.The Skinny mix is nothing special , overall a good CD but dont expect any trance from Rollo or quickwit rapps from Eminem."

1,The olives were rancid,"We're terribly disappointed. This was the second time we ordered this product - the first 5lb bag was incredible - we snarfed them all down. The olives were firm and full of flavor, had a nice greek olive scent. The second one was terrible - they tasted rancid and smelled terrible. We ended up throwing them all away - we were afraid we'd get sick. We will not be ordering again - very disappointed that the product was not even edible."
3,Green Olives Generally Firm - Darker Varieties often soft/mushy,"The mix I received seemed to have a great variation between the green ones and the black varieties. I found the greens generally to be in good shape, firm, and tasty. Most of the darker ones though were a little mashed/mushed and I didn't want to eat them because I like firm olives."
3,Eh...,"Having now tried most of the bulk olives on Amazon, I can say that these were the most disappointing. Somehow, they managed to get all 4 varieties to taste more or less the same. I guess it's the spices they use that mask the subtle differences in flavor between olive varieties. For a really great bulk olive mix, try the Vigo mixed olives also on Amazon."
2,Just OK,"I was hosting a large party and decided to get this bulk package from Amazon - both for cooking and for serving as apps. These were ok, but nothing special. The mix had mostly green olives, quite a few olives were mashed. They were a little salty for my taste, so I soaked the batch which I was serving as an app in clear water to release some of their salt. I probably won't be ordering these again - I didn't care for the taste and they aren't an especially good value: I recently found out that a Town and Country supermarket in my area with a great olive bar regularly has 6.99/lb specials on olives, including Moroccan and Castelvetrano."
4,Brine problem???,"The brine in the olive package has been different in succeeding orders which is very apparent after they have been opened and refrigerated. Whatever the oil is, it coagulates easily because of the cold. Too much oil for my taste Still like em and the price is decent.."
2,Not as advertised,"These are individual knobs, not a 4 pack! When I contacted the seller, he advised me that Amazon had incorrectly listed the product. If that's the case, why hadn't the seller asked Amazon to correct it? I contacted Amazon myself and told them of the discrepancy. Don't think you're getting 4 knobs for $4.00. You're only getting one!!!"
3,"Not good, but not bad","The first time I saw this movie, I thought that I missed quite a bit of it. I watched it again and discovered that I had just missed the beginning credits. It was interesting in a way, but I was sadly disappointed in the ending. Too many things about the village made no sense to me. Like how did they get all the supplies and equipment, etc., etc., to create this village and to continue to live in it without anyone from the ""towns"" knowing about it. It was not what I was expecting from watching the trailers when it first came out. I am glad that I didn't spend money on going to see it. I would probably watch it again on cable, just to watch it, but I would not add it to my DVD library."
1,The Horrible!,"Too long to get to the point, this story would have made a good half-hour Twilight Zone episode instead of a horrible movie. Someone needs to sit M. Night S. down and have the guts to tell him that his story-telling skills are getting way too corny."
2,Think About This!,"Even if you accept the basic premise of the movie, how can you escape the fact that these people would have had to see planes and helicopters periodically flying over their 19th century village, no matter how isolative they tried to be? What if they would have seen jet contrails high in the sky? It's preposterous to think that the younger people born into the village wouldn't find those things strange. I was disappointed by this movie."
1,IF I COULD RATE IT LESS THAN 1 STAR I WOULD. HORRIBLE!!!!!,"I can't even begin to say how utterly horrendous, STUPID, and pitifully plotted this movie was. The ending is one of the dumbest in the history of movies. I am being completely honest when I say DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CR*P. The studio - and Shamalyan - dupe you into believing it is scary when it is NOT ONE IOTA SCARY. MORONIC is the only word that will come to mind at the end of this movie."
1,Another M. Night Shyamalan disaster,"A talented cast do their best, but are undone by the ultimate auteur of our age, M. Night Shyamalan. Shyamalan's films are characterized by being plodding and moody, always with a ""surprise"" ending. Well, sorry, what he conceives of as being profound and clever, I see as lumbering and predictable.There are people whose films I like, those whose films I admire, those whose work I admire more than I like, and those whose work I like more than I admire. At the ends of the spectrum are those whose work I both admire and like and those whose work I neither admire nor like. Shyamalan is in this latter group.If you like any other of his films, you're probable slow enough to like this one. Otherwise, avoid at all costs!"
2,"""We have the magic rocks""","I think most people who have seen this would agree that M. Night Syamalan does a great job with the monsters. They are creepy, and later in the film a girl encounters a creature in a scene that made me jump.The problem with this film is the fact that it is hard to take it seriously. They need a cure for this guy, so they send a blind girl to get it. An old lady tells the guy that he is an idiot for sending his blind daughter into the forest, yet he tries to tell the old lady the her bravery outweighs her blindness. And while the blind girl traverses the forest, she doesn't hit any trees. For some reason she is able to navigate the forest perfectly, even to the point of remembering where things were. It is said that when you lose a sense, your other senses become stronger. Still, it is too unbelievable, which ruins the creepy atmosphere.If you want a creepy film, hit up M. Night Shyamalan's Sixth Sense."
1,Just Bad,"I can't even express how much I hated this film. The only good thing I have to say about this movie is that Bryce Dallas Howard did turn in quite a good performance, despite what seemed like a phoned-in effort from director Shyamalan. It was so bad, they may as well have had Stevie Wonder direct (no offense Stevie). I think that Shyamalan's formula is definately wearing thin, and I'm just sick of it. Definately the most boring movie I have ever sat through. I guess I just kept thinking that Shyamalan would pull it off in the end, which he did not. This movie was like an experiment in bad film making. I wouldn't suggest viewing this movie, unless it's free."
1,"Boring, Same Old Stuff","I won't go into all the plot spoilers of this movie, and stuff that doesn't make sense to me because people always say ""I am missing the point"" and ""You don't see Shyamalans deeper message."" What I will say is Shyamalan needs to either quit making movies, stop making movies with predictable twists now that he has made the same movie 5 times in a row, or stop stealing other peoples stories and making them suck.Check out Running Out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix if you don't know what I'm talking about. She might as well have her name added to the credits.Sixth Sense was good, it got me. I liked Unbreakable, maybe cause I was still new to Shyamalans plot twists, but really I just enjoyed it. Signs was terrible, perhaps my least favorite movie of all time. Then there is The Village which is just as bad and stolen from another author."
2,Predictable,"A sub-standard, unconvincing and just plain un-scary suspense film. As others have noted, the ""twist"" ending can be seen from miles away. In retrospect , this is only the first nail in Shyamalan's coffin."
2,Boring,"Absolutely one of the most boring movies I ever watched in my life.There are hardly any scenes that deserve to be named scary and the disappointing plot of the movie is handed over to quickly.Although for me that was a relieve really, as I could switch off the movie immediately after that. The characters are dull, but then again, so is the entire movie. This should have been an episode of Twilight Zone or so, but not a complete movie. I hope this was the final M. Night Shyamalan movie, because things get worse and worse. Unbreakable, Signs and The Village have hopefully by now discouraged producers to do another one!(SARR)"
1,I'd recommend to anyone who suffers from insomnia,"If you struggle with an inability to fall asleep or remain asleep for an adequate length of time, this movie is a potential cure. I've tried to watch it twice and was bored to sleep both times."
2,"The Village is horrific -- at least, in a BAD way","This movie is just not worth your time at all. First of all, it's boring. Second of all, it's very confusing. The plot is thin. Lastly, it's makes no sense. That's pretty much all there is to it. Don't see it!"
1,This was supposed to ba F***ing horror movie!,"they advertised this movie like it was going to be a scary monster in the woods movie and I saw it because the sixth sense and signs were good, but it was so BAD, the biggest threat in the movie was a retarded guy! come on a RETARDED guy! The monsters were not real they were always people in costumes (unless you think of retarded people as monsters). It was so stupid the worst twist in any movie ever! and I would give this movie zero stars but thaty wasnt an option. dont see this movie, dont give M. night Shamamalon more money, HE DOES NOT DESERVE IT!"
2,"Strong start, bad finish","This movie started out kind of different and entertaining, but towards the end, it becomes hokey and ridiculous.Would not recommend."
2,Not thrilling at all,I was not on the edge of my seat one bit throughout this whole movie. I had the plot figured out before I even got to the middle of it. It is not original. They did something similar to this on the Outer Limits. One of Shyamalan's worst.
2,Do not see if you value your life?,"If you want to sit threw a boring two hour movie for a very predictible twist that i guessed in the first five minutes, well then i suggest this movie.The concept was decent, the monsters looked really cool but the lack of any suspense minus one two minute scene was dissapointing, but i dont mind the drama if it would have all ment something or went somewhere with it. People boo'd in the theater. They should let me make a movie. It would be better this guy. Hey Shymalan heres a twist for your next movie, dont make one, your twists suck."
1,Horrible,This movie was horrible. It was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Watching it was a waste of time.
4,Beautiful,"Well developed story line, excellent characters you can relate to. Imagery is superb as is the typical for M. Night Shamalian. I know a few who were disappointed with the twist but i thought it was really great. A treat for the soul!"
3,"""Good, but not Shyamalan at his best""","Is this film as bad as people and critics say it is, well no. This film is ahead of its time. People don't understand that other people can be so broken inside that they run away from life.Spoilers AheadThe ending tricks the audience, the film makes people think that their going to belive in the boogie man again, but what I like about the film is the trick in the end. But why put an ending like that in the film. What Mr. Shyamalan should do is keep his films simple. ""Signs"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", these films are as simple as they get, they scar us, they give us twists and turns, but not stupid twists like ""The Village."" The acting is good, but their all acting on the same level. Ron Howards doughter is one of the stars in the film, but can she do better. I happen to like the ending and the acting, and the so-called plot, but I can see why people hate this film."
3,"Not Shyamalan's best, but entertaining nonetheless","This was one of the few summer movies that I was eagerly awaiting, only to be let down by an ending that seemed to be more of a weak deflation of the film's mystery than a satisfying resolution. M. Night's trademark, of course, is the twist ending, but the delivery of it here is not as shocking as in The Sixth Sense or even Unbreakable. Shyamalan is a master at telling a simple story, however, and there are moments when he breathes an amazing amount of new life into scenes we have seen a thousand times before. Even though The Village is my least favorite film of Shyamalan's, he remains an exciting and original director that I love to watch."
3,Atmosphere But Not Much Else!,"I think Shyalmalan is trying to say alot of things in this film which is normal but I think the same thing was attempted in SIGNS but didn't quite go anywhere. In the VILLAGE we have idealic setting deviod of all the things that we can relate too like a place on earth completely deviod of minority groups of anykind with the exception of very odd cauasians. The color red is bad, and we have a person suffering from mental retardation as a form of comic relief, and better not leave the confines of the Village or else these monsters will get you but wait a minute they're not really monsters...I don't want to give away much like the GOTCHA ending. But I have to give it to Shyamalan, he can create some creepy atmosphere but you have to do some of your own digging for substance. This films wasn't as bad as some reviewers have panned it. But I'll be honest, I would rather watch THE PRINCE OF SPACE than this film twice. But I invite you to see it for yourself."
2,"Excellent acting, script, concept, not scary one bit","The acting was great, the lighting and mood was superb, but what happened to the scary aspect of a horror film? There wasn't one single scene in this movie that was scary. You could tell a lot of thinking went into the plot movement of the story, but unless great dialogue and acting (the kind of movie that belongs more in romance or drama) is your thing... Good movie, bad horror film, but since that is what it was supposed to be, I have no choice but to grade it thus. Looking for a good scare? Don't visit the Village."
4,"Develop the ""falling action ... ""","My husband rented this movie! I had no intentions of viewing it but shortly after he pressed play, I stopped what I was doing and was quickly pulled into the movie. However, as soon as the climax of the movie was unveiled, which is close to the end of viewing time, the movie was far too short and very disappointing. More could have been developed in with the falling action!!!Now, this is not to say this movie did not make me think, but it did frustrate me utterly at the end due to the short tie-ups if you will.I would recommend this movie just be prepared for some disappointment/s towards the end of the movie."
4,Love This Movie,"This is one of my favorite movies! It has an excellent cast of characters played by Hurt, Weaver, Phoenix, Brody and let us not forget Bryce Dallas Howard - the daughter of Ron Howard. It is an original story that could be taken right out of the headlines of the 6 o'clock news. It is a light thriller with a great story and I don't think it falls apart at the end at all. It is also a fantastic love story of sorts with unique characters not often seen in movies...(blind young women and Noah, a special needs individual). It is definitely worth a look if you are a follower of these actors."
3,DVD skipped,The DVD skipped a couple of times and I had to end up moving forward to the next scene to continue the movie.
5,Fantastic Film,"Everyone keeps complaining that this movie wasn't scary enough and that the previews were misleading. I think they had to make the previews misleading in order to keep the outcome a complete secret. I was expecting something totally different from what was happening and was totally surprised at the end. That's the way it should be. Signs was advertised to make the film look a bit scary, but you find that the story is more about faith than aliens... a wonderful surprise that, just like The Village, left me with a ""wow"" feeling as the credits began to roll.I'll be adding this one to my DVD collection for sure."
3,Lets leave this place,"I was very impressed with the feel of the movie. It made me feel exactly the way the movie was supposed to make you feel,with a sense of peace,hope,tranquility,and no worries, a place that we all want to go when this world that we live in is going the way or is the way it is.But as we know, I dont think there can be quite a place like that without fear,death,and everything that is opposite of light or good.I thought the ending was cool, but it didnt have you saying oh my gosh with excitement as in Signs or The Sixth Sense.You know the suspence with Signs and The Sixth Sense was frighting.The little girl never finishing her water and wondering why,and then finding out in the end that it was there to destroy the alien, that was excellant story telling by the director.How about finding out Bruce Willis was a ghost all along,excellant.The Village had these components in them but not as strong.Still a good movie, but not his best.Can only wait till his next one."
3,"Not bad, not my cup of tea","Well, I think many of us expected a scary movie with a twist ending.We got it - halfly. It was a bit scary and had a bit twist ending - but not up to the standards that the 6th sense set before.The atmosphere of the film and the direction is excellent. But that's all.Anyone who wants to see monsters or a big twist in the end will be disappointed. I was.There are silly things in the storyline that drove me mad when wathcing the film. I don't want to spoiler or anything, it's just silly and dull. But as I said, the direction is top-notch.Though I didn't like it too much, it's not a bad film at all - there is a lot work and effort in it, just not my cup of tea."
3,Wasn't what I had expected at all!,"I REALLY wanted to love this movie, but it left me somewhat disappointed, especially at the end. I was hoping it would be similar to Signs, but it didn't even come close! The acting was really great, and Bryce Dallas Howard was awesome. The problem is that the story fell short of all the hype that was going around. I agree with several reviewers who said that this movie was far more romantic than being scary, and the ending... well, I just didn't see it coming at all! I have M. Night's other movies in my DVD collection, but I believe I will pass on this one. I just hope the next movie he does will be up to the standards of The Sixth Sense, and Signs!"
3,1/2* Not high on the scares but not bad either,"In the tradition of the Signs and his critically acclaimed supernatural thriller The Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan's latest clearly is a moving tribute to the compassion and love of mankind. It has none of the jaw-dropping twists dished out in his maiden effort but The Village benefits from classy direction and first-rate acting from a seasoned ensemble. Bryce Dallas Howard, debuting as blind girl Ivy Walker, sparkles with courage and grit; Adrien Brody builds up the tension with his schizophrenia, while Joaquin Phoenix moves with his subtle performance of rage. Supporting cast Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt is under-used however. Shyamalan's pace may be slow in the first half of the film, but the atmospheric tingles coupled with James Newton Howard's haunting score will keep you awake. Not his best to date, but the Village shimmers with the allegorical unease and insecurity that hasn't left us since 9-11."
3,Yikes! Not in a scary way.,"The acting is fine and top notch. The cinematography is gorgeous, setting vibrant yellows, reds and greens against a gray and brown backdrop. The first 20 mintues or so are suspenseful and scary. Then it clods along, turning into a love story. Not a bad thing if that was how The Village was marketed. Instead, it was pushed as a horror film and let me tell you the scares are few and far between. The secret ""twist"" is reviewed about an hour in and then there's another half hour to go just to drive the point home. I pretty much had the ""twist"" figured out about 40 minutes in and let me tell you, it's pretty disappointing. The Village doesn't reach the clever heights of the Sixth Sense or the suspenseful thrills of Signs, instead it starts off hot but when the ""twist"" is revealed it's lukewarm at best. See it but be warned. 2 1/2 stars."
2,So Do Proud Men Die...,"Clearly Shyamalan was going for a movie more ""Signs"" than Signs itself was: upping the rural factor, putting the adept Joaquin Phoenix in a bigger role, and changing the aliens (I'm not making this up) to hooded porcupine walruses.Missing, however, is the originality, humor, and suspense of ""Signs,"" or ""The Sixth Sense"" (I haven't seen ""Unbreakable""). Instead we've got an overbearingly preachy preacher/teacher (William Hurt) and just a generally goofy story. Even Shyamalan's trademark cameo is annoying; we see the back of his head and a faint reflection on a refrigerator (ooh, who is it?)I saw this one pretty late at night; I was falling asleep in the first half hour, but did my best to stay up, thinking it would pick up. Nope.Two stars for James Newton Howard's often beautiful score and the refreshing romance between the quietly powerful Phoenix and the lovely Bryce Dallas Howard."
1,BOOOOOOOOO!!!,"Boos over powered the ending credits in the opening night veiwing of M. Night Shymalan's latest flop. Shymalan should invest in a career of advertising and get out of the movie business. Sixth Sense was his best. The Words of New Found Glory, ""Its all downhill from here."" Are synomonous with the Career of Mr. Shymalan. The advertised thriller was a boring, stupid, waste of my time and money. I often think of doing as the South Park kids and trcking down the maniacal Shymalan and requesting my money back. I strongly advise you to change your plans if you plan on going to see The Village."
2,"M.Night's REALLY gotta improve on his ""thrillers.""","It was worse than I expected. The only good parts were the village invasion and the woods. But the others were just plain boring. ""The Village"" never grabbed my attention, nor did it excite me. This is the 2nd film where M.Night disappoints me. The only part that got me A LITTLE grabbed was the end. The forest scenes were pretty thrilling, and knowing that the year was really 2000. To recap it all, anyone who's bored out of their minds could watch this."
2,dissapointed,"I actually rented this movie with fairly high expectations which may me part of why I only gave it a two. The plot seemed severely dragged out, almost as if they needed to meet a length requirement. The ""twist"" was not a surprise at all, if you're looking for something similar to the likes of ""The Sixth Sense"" you will most likely be disappointed.Apparently others found this movie enjoyable but I regretted watching it the minute it ended. I didn't have any problems with the acting or camera work which is the only reason I didn't give it one star."
3,The surprise ending? It's really a borough.,"I had read so much bad press about this film beforehand that I went into it expecting to hate it. I was very pleasantly surprised. Perhaps the thing that most people react to is that it isn't what they expect. It is being marketed as a horror film. This is a suspense film.Shyamalan is working against his past films and reputation. I fear that audiences are going in with too many expectations. We all know that there will be a surprise ending. Due to the press, I all ready had a good idea of what the surprise was, but the pleasure comes from the way in which the secret is revealed. Shyamalan comes from the old short story/Twilight Zone school of storytelling, wherein the pleasure comes not from cheap thrills, but the gradual buildup of tension to be released with an ironic ending.All in all, if you come to the film with no preconceptions - and you like his other films - I think you will enjoy The Village."
1,What's so scary about this movie?,In my opinion I didn't think it was scary at all. It was more of a romance movie than a scary movie. Maybe if there was a book out of The Village I would think it's scary but the movie didn't scare me at all. Sorry but that's just me.
1,Not scary,"Actually, this movie is not a horror film. The 'creatures they do not speak of' are actually made up by the ""elders"" to keep the people living in the village, not doubting anything at all. While the village lives in the 1800's, the real world is actually going on outside of this protected area, living in the present time. Turns out the elders wanted to escape a crime-ridden real life and live their lives in isolation, pretending it really is 1890. Not scary at all, and very predictible plot."
2,This Movie Was Sucked !!!,"This movie was BORING , all along you knew there was no real threat to the village, but for some un-known reason it kept you hangin' till the end. The acting was slow & boring , nothing to look forward to. I would only recommend this movie if you have 5 year olds that have no clue whats going on & you want to keep the in fron of the tv for the length of the movie !!!"
2,"Boring, nothing too special!","Very boring throughout the whole film, the ending was ok but nothing too special!"
5,Great Movie - Not what Expected,"I think that people are being too hard on this movie. I loved it. It is not at all what I expected, and for a brief moment I was disappointed in that. But the movie was great nonetheless. For those of you who have not seen it, please go in with an open mind. It is not what the previews make it out to be. I thought by the previews that it looked to have the same concept as Signs. That is not at all true. The twist is great, but view with an open mind."
3,All depends what you expect....,"I think the problem is the director bills this as another scare movie with a twist like Sixth Sense or Unbreakable. With every movie he has made, the twist has gotten less and less until finally we come to the Village. I think if you are not expecting a twist and are there to watch a movie, this could be okay. I didn't feel like I wasted my time watching it. But when the ""twist"" of sorts is revealed half-way through, I kept waiting for the twist. I thought at the end I would be surprised, I couldn't wait to find out what the twist was, then the movie was over. As a movie, it was okay. Good acting, decent plot. As a THRILLER, it was crap."
3,No Sixth Sense...but it didn't stink,It was quite interesting. After watching it I was able to put it all together....just like The Sixth Sense. The same reaction....oooohhh gee that was wierd. Not a bad film. I'm glad it was on Showtime.
5,A timely metaphor,"Despite the flood of negative reviews, I found this movie to be highly engrossing. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that I was unaware of the director's previous credits when I happened upon this film so I had no pre-conceived notions going into the theater. The strongest point of the movie, in my opinion, is the metaphor it so aptly creates about contemporary politics/religion. Read: George W. Bush vs. the terrorists. My personal congratulations to the director for the taking the creative risk of producing a mainstream film that doesn't conform to the formulaic user's manual of Hollywood slasher flicks but insteads utilizes an almost anachronistic, 19th century novelistic approach to film-making to communicate a potent warning with much more staying power than may be readily apparent at first glance."
3,A In Between film,"the marketing department is to blame, because they billed thisas a horror or thriller film when it really was'nt, that turned off alot moviegoers. then they had that secrets behind m night life which was scarier than the film personally for me. the hype is what killed this film , sixth sense , unbreakable did'nt have much of that so they were more successful, M night manyou let me down . the film was'nt too bad but it's not a full five stars, but i have to say the photography is excellent. if this film would've been billed as drama probably would've done better i think. but if you want to check this out at your local blockbuster you can't go wrong with it , it's not that horrible of film. byrce howard ron howard's daughter is wonderful in her debut role in this film and i hope to see her more films she's quite lovely."
1,TOTAL CRAP,"The Village is the worst movie I've ever seen. M. Night Shyamalan should be ashamed he ever made this after a masterpiece like the 6th Sense, Signs which was okay, and Unbreakable which was mediocre at best. But this is a disgrace, its not even scary, my friends begged me that I go to see this ""movie"", and during the first 20 minutes I fell asleep. Then they waked me up, I saw the scene when those creatures or whatever they are came from the forest to threaten the village and I laughed, I didn't know if it is supposed to be a joke or a scary scene. Plus nothing special happens during all the story and the main actress is plain horrible, only in the end of the movie I got that she is even blind. After it ended I wanted to kill myself for wasting 5 dollars for this piece of s**t!With no doubt one of the (if not the) worst movies ever."
1,Proving Again: Steroid Marketing CAN Sell Used Condoms,"What a heap of sh*#. I knew when I rented it that I was going to get a slow horror movie, but for THAT amount of hoopla, gimme somethin for chrissakes. Then you realize that's where all the money went, not in the movie but marketing.EFF YOU; M. NITE SHAM-ALOT"
1,YAWN!!!!!!!!!!!,"Instead of watching this film do something more interesting - watch grass grow! Yes, it was that BAD! And what kind of poststructural deal is with the color red? The 'heroine' of this massive piece of bird poop has RED hair?!!!! So doesn't that make her evil, and shouldn't she be buried along with the other 'red' things?"
1,Dreadful.,"The Village is a complete mess! Even Joaquin Phoenix and Judy Greer can't save this beyond slow, confusing, and pretentious ""thriller"". M. Night Shyamalan thinks he is a fantastic writer and actor but he is too lost in his arrogant head to write a true horror flick. The only film of his that I do like is The Sixth Sense, now that movie is pure brilliance. You can't create magic twice and this stinker may be even slightly better than The Lady in the Water, ugh! Hope you can get through this film without shutting down your DVD player, good luck!"
2,I'm disappointed with Night,"I am very disappointed with Night's performance, and I'm a very big fan of his! The ending was predictable and for that it sucked. A very bad plot. I am definitly not satisfied with this movie. But it was original and Night tried so I'll give it two stars."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"This entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you wouldn't miss anything and might even enjoy it. Unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and I couldn't wait for it to end. I saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was. At least a quarter of them walked out before the end. It's that bad. It's a shame, I love a good suspense/horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted."
2,Come M. - Don't fail us now!!!,Movie was okay... But I guess the real shocker was the early century village was actually taking place in today's world.... Actually kinda stupid but alright film.
1,Confused,"I read about 80 of the other reviews but no one seems to question about Kevin and the Walker Wildlife preserve. What's that all about? Please someone fill me in on this part of the movie! Why was Kevin so freaked out by Ivy? What was Kevin's boss freaked out about? This part of movie just made no sense to me. Why is it called ""Walker"" wildlife preserve, just like the town elder? I can see the town wanting to hide from society, but why were the outside people afraid of the town? Help!"
2,Predictable,"First let me say that I'm not a fan of M. Night Shyamalan. I find him to be a good director, but a bit of a hack when it comes to plot.This movie was probably his best plot. The ""twist"" of it was perhaps a bit obvious; I was suspicious of it by 3 minutes into the movie and certain of it by 30 minutes in. However, the basic premise is interesting. Handled differently, this might have actually been a really good film.The directing was something any hack with a camera could have done. The scene editing made the first half hour boring, which made the rest of the movie neither scary nor interesting. The camera angle selection also would lead one to believe an amature was shooting this film. Only one scene, where Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix discuss their feelings on a porch after a creature attack, does Shyamalan show us what he is capable of.In short, don't waste money to see this, but if it's free and you've got nothing better to do, it isn't unbearable."
3,"I still like the guy, but. . .","I loved ""Sixth Sense"" - fell for it completely. I really liked ""Signs"" - I thought, if 'they' are really out there, it could happen! I saw the commercials and I hoped ""The Village"" would scare me silly; and, I really waited until the very last credit to decide that it really wasn't going to, not even a little bit. I love scary movies, and this isn't one of them.But, I still like M. Night Shyamalan."
4,Pretty good,"All i've heard from people is that this movie is boring and not scary, but do you know what I heard quite a bit in the movie theater??? Screams! I looked around and people looked freaked out. When we all walked out, the only thing everyone could say was how awesome the movie was, and it is true. This is a good movie. It does, like every movie, has it's problems. Bryce Dallas Howard did very well in the movie, even though there were times where she didn't act blind. She gave a very excellent performance. People who do not like this movie can crawl back under the rock they've been living in. Though I didn't find it to be too scary, it had a good dramatic pull."
3,ENOUGH ALREADY! Can We Just Have a Normal Ending???,"M. Night, please! We love ya, but the gimmicky endings are getting old. Annoying more like it. This film is wonderfully acted, beautifully shot, for the most part plenty suspenseful, but the ending is such a let down. Its like we were lied to for 2 hours and the pay-off just wasn't there for me. The film works a little better on TV. The DVD features an excellent transfer and a THX encoded soundtrack. William Hurt is especially effective as the father who must make a choice that could be disasterous for all in the village. This movie is a SHEEP in WOLVES clothing. It is nopt what it appears to be. OK, M. Night, we know you are the master at that stuff, but lets learn a new trick shall we? Thanks. If this review is confusing to you, good! The movie is even more confusing."
2,hi boring,"This movie was so retarded...The ""scary things"" in woods was this fake halloween costume that wasnt scary at all. It didnt even make any sense. It went by slow and was really boring. I expected to see a scary movie and this definitly wasn't one. The romantic story line was a little less then decent. Go see Signs instead."
4,A Pleasant Surprise - Especially Given the Negative Reviews,"While M. Night's has maybe backed himself into a corner with the audience expecting to be shocked at some point, this is nevertheless ranks right up there with The Sixth Sense for me. The shocker bit isn't that much of a shocker, but that is unimportant. The crux of this movie is the love story between the two characters, played by Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard. That is the real story - how far one would go for a beloved. Ms. Howard is a find - one of the most unaffected actresses of her generation to grace the screen. Don't watch this movie for the twist. Watch it for the love story. It's a pleasant surprise."
3,Give This Movie A Chance.,"I had put off watching this movie because I had heard so many people I know talk about how bad it was. One of my friends had bought the DVD and liked it. I borrowed it from him and he told me I would probably get really bored with it but to not give up on it and it would all pay off in the end. After about and hour and fifteen minutes I had had almost all I could take but stuck it out just because of what my friend told me. Sure enough it paid off with a great twist almost as good as the sixth sense. I thought I had figured out the twist before but I was quite surprised when I found out the real twist. I won't give anything away but like my friend said give it a chance. I won't lie, the first hour is excruciatingly slow but the payoff comes."
2,disappointment,i was expecting a great supernaturel movie with lots of suspence but it wasn't. At the end of the show I was very disappointed. The people were good but it was the plot behind it all that i found most ....... disappointing of all.It was not what i was hoping for in the movie
3,Not As Spooky But Romance Saves the Day,"I loved most of Shyamalan's previous work, ""Sixth Sense"", ""The Signs"", but felt a little disappointed after watching ""The Village"" as it seemed a little predictable when the plot twists would come instead of being shocked into horror... However, as a sucker for romance, I fell in love with it as the romantic content kept me watching it till the end and not the suspense."
2,I laughed my ass off!!!,When the previews for this movie came out it looked really good and i wanted to see it really bad...after seeing it i thought it was the cheesiest funniest movie i've ever seen!!! the only good parts in the movie were the Adrien Brody and Joaquin phoneix......other than that i would tell my friends to never see it unless they wanna laugh!!
1,Definitely not a thriller!,"There was so much hype about this movie and when I finally watched it, I want the 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life back. It was deemed ""thriller"" and I spent the first 30 minutes laughing and there was hardly any suspense. The only interesting part of the movie was when one of them left their ""coveted"" village to breach ""the other towns"" and you saw the true time ""difference"". Otherwise, this move is sooo not worth it! It was not a thriller or a horror by any means."
2,One to avoid for horror fans,"Advance word on this film was that it was really, really scary. It isn't. Not even remotely. The overriding emotion provoked by the Village is - besides a lingering a sense of unease - irritation and, to be quite frank, boredom. I won't spoil the plot but then again, there's not much of a plot to spoil. Even a blob of jelly could guess what the ending is. The Village is slow-paced, but lacks the tension and bite to counter balance it. William Hurt talks real slow - even slower than usual - and the rest of the cast wonder about the set like extras out of Little House on the Prairie. When the 'twist' at the end comes it is surely one of the biggest anticlimaxes since Y2K. So, if you want scary, check out The Grudge `cause this will most likely send you to sleep."
1,Not very interesting.,"'The Village' was not very interesting and was a bore from beginning to end. The ""twist"" at the end was not all that shocking because it was implausible and ridiculous."
2,What a waste of cast and budget,"This movie was just bad. The dialog was campy and the ""suspense"" was just stupid. M. Night Shyamalan needs to move on to a different type of movie (if he can) because the plot of The Village is so thin, it is clear that he has run out of ideas. A real film maker could have taken this story so much further - The ""evolution"" of the creatures would have been a thousand times more interesting. How did the village get built? Why? That would have made a really great film - instead, M. Night Shyamalan waste a super cast (how does he get these really good actors and actresses to act so poorly?)on a rip off of the Twilight Zone and the novel ""The Giver"". He needs to get over this ""Written, Produced and Directed by M. Night Shyamalan"" business - Make a good film and get past the ego."
2,I'm not sure you should visit this 'Village'.,"I wish I could give this more stars than two because I've seen other work of Shyamalan's and I thought it was incredible. This movie starts out slow, wasn't able to hold my interest too well, and was peppered with a lot of bad acting (except for Bryce, I thought she did wonderfully) The only part that was worth it for me was the ending, and even at that, I thought it was a rather weak delivery. I wasn't expecting much when I went into this movie and I'm glad that I didn't, or I would have been let down even more. I was also rather confused with the direction of this movie, it seemed like things weren't really making sense. I went into the extras, it made a little more sense after that..but even so, I can't see myself watching this again. I think Shyamalan is going to have to do better the next time around or he's really going to be in trouble."
1,Made me mad,"I thought that this movie was going to be a horror film... it was anything but that. I was so mad with the ""surprise twist"". It was so stupid and it ruined the whole movie. I would give away the details but I won't waste my time. Let's just say they should have stuck with the idea of ""the creatures"" attacking the village. What a horrible movie..."
2,Where's the suspense?,"Loads of people on Amazon have already stated exactly what I want to say, so I'll just give my two-cents: 'The Village' is extremely misleading, uneventful, predictable, and most of all NOT A HORROR FILM AS ADVERTISED.Lots of reviewers stated that the twist ending of this film was easy to predict within the first 10 minutes of this film. I, personally, was surprised by the ending (maybe I'm slow?), but was supremely let down by the ending. It falls flat and makes you feel stupid for spending $7.50 on a ticket.This film is not a horror film. Nor is it a suspense thriller. It is simply a romantic drama with a spooky back-drop. If I wanted to see a romantic drama, I would have walked into the next theater over and saw ""The Notebook"". The idea of this film could have taken off, but it crash-landed soon into flight. So many things could have been written differently and just... grrrr! It's so frustruating because ""The Village"" could have been so much more."
1,The Village,"I just got back from a midnight showing of The Village.It is the most slow-moving manipulative movie I think I have ever seen. DON'T GO SEE IT! It's not worth your money or time. The entire advertised premise is not what you think it is. By the time you get to the end, you don't care about anything or anyone, and any ""twist"" justs adds to the frustration of waiting for something good to happen that never does.I predict that this will be the end of M. Night's ""spooky"" film career. What a waste!"
1,Shyamalan Took A Vacation,"SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!This is not Drama, Mystery, or Terror, it's a comedy. The first time that thing walked (sorry, waddled) into the frame, I laughed my head off. What was that?Shyamalan tries too hard to make a surprising twist. What made his other movies great was that they dealt with small stories.Yes, in Signs aliens were taking over the world, but it wasn't about the aliens. It was about that one man who is trying to protect his family. Yes, it was very absurd, but the way it was done was very believable.I know five year olds that could have made a better ""Village"" than the one that was released in theaters.I hope that Shyamaln's next film will be much better.Maybe he will return from his vacation."
1,this movie sucks,the movie was retarded and its the dummest movie. it made no sense and it was so fake . the stupid retard was the animal that killed people i think cause the movie so confusing also why dont the town get together and run to the other town that would be better. it also waould be better if the girl wasnt blind and had a shotgun and a few grenades.
3,It was OK...,"I saw this movie last year; expected more thrills and chills. Guessed the ""twist"" within about 15 minutes.One thing: wasn't Edward Walker (the character William Hurt portrays) the name of the character he killed in ""Body Heat"" ?? Or was it Edmund Walker? Something like that."
3,"Atmospheric, romantic, and a little scary - but silly ending","This movie is well written and very well acted and I enjoyed it right up until the end (or ending). William Hurt, whom I often find disappointing, delivers a passionate, low key performance - perfect for the fantasy the director wants to weave. The cast is ernest and they sell the premise very well. I have to admit, I was caught up in the whole spooky creature thing. After ""Signs"" - a movie I liked - I was ready to believe anything. I guess when the secret was revealed, I felt cheated and began to think, how could that happen? I would have been happier with a NJ Devil like creature, rather than the way this movie ended. Unlike ""6Th Sense,"" if you know the ending of this movie, it's not going to be very entertaining. Let's call it a nice little movie with some good acting and an ending with a twist."
4,CREEPY AND INTRIGUING,"A surprisingly riveting thriller that lives of the M. Night Shyamalan reputation. Some genuinely creeping moments. By the end of the movie all of your questions will be answered in a satisfying manner. Some really intriguing performances, especially from Bryce Howard, Ron Howard's daughter, as a blind villager determined to rescue her lover."
2,Totally Not What I Expected!,"I got to rent the movie ""The Village"" three days before it came out. It was the first time I saw it and I was really dissed. Most of the movie is nothing but talk. Romance talk. This was a weird movie. The movie was about Amish residents who believed there were evil creatures who lived in the borders of their village. It excited me at first, but later they revealed a secret about the creatures that you probably do not want to hear. This movie to me, well... it sucked. But, you can see the movie yourself and have your personal opininon on it."
3,Too bad he didn't credit the book,"Has no one every read ""Running Out of Time"" by Margaret Peterson Haddix? While watching this movie I kept thinking, I've seen this before. It wasn't until late in the movie that I remembered reading a book almost exactly like this. Then, I scanned the closing credits for the author credit and there was none.It is very disappointing when a powerful, well-known, artist is able to blatently rip off the ideas of a lesser-known artist and is never called to account for it.And the movie didn't live up to the hype, either."
2,Waste of time and/or money,"The movie itself is boring like few, and toward the end you'll realize it wasn't even half of what you probably expected it to be. If you haven't seen it, you haven't missed anything at all; if you were thinking about buying it, save some time and money, do yourself a favor and look for something else."
1,Disappointing,"Movie drags storyline. When finally something begins to make sense to you the viewer, it is a disappointing ending and you wish you could get your 2 wasted hours back."
1,bad details,"I ordered this DVD as a gift, and when the person took it home to play it on his DVD player, it would not play! It ifs formatted for foreign viewing (written in tiny print at the bottom of the case) This was not stated ANYWHERE on the website info page for the DVD!!! I went back and looked for it!!! So now I have to get it back from this person, who lives in another state, then return it and wait for a (maybe) refund??? I have been a faithful Amazon shopper for years and recommend it to all my friends, but as of today this may change! It will depend on whether they fix this mistake in a timely and courteous manner. Okay, I'm done venting now. Please be sure to read ALL of the teeny tiny print before you hit place order now! Very disappointing experience!"
3,Came Up Short,"A lot of great talent in this movie so the acting was very good. However I found the movie to be a bit of a sleeper most of the time because I was expecting something a bit more exciting I guess..I especially don't like movies that end with the audience wondering ""What's the rest of the story here?"" I mean I got the drift, but I like to have more info about the particulars..."
3,Visaully breathtaking.....but a weak story line!,"This film is the worst of all of M. Night Shyamalan's work. That being said I did watch it again. The story line was really weak, and really a stretch. Most people of average intelligence can figure out where this movie is going about 30 minutes into the film. But, visually, and I love those Fall and Winter visuals, this film is beautiful. And, the actors, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, and Bryce Howard do a splendid job with a bad plot. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is 5 stars and is really what saves this film. The Village should be in everyone's private film library because it is the best example of M. Night Shymalan's use of camera as canvas, despite it being his worse film story. He does have an eye for scene and location."
3,This is not a horror movie,I think the main reason this movie got such bad reviews from alot is that it was considered a horror movie and in my opinion it's not. I thought the acting and the story were pretty good. I don't know what to consider this movie but definately not horror. This is worth checking out
3,"Decent, but unremarkable","The Village movie is well-made and interesting in a number of ways, but it just isn't very appealing. It works at cross-purposes, undermining the effect that it seems to have been building to, and ultimately delivers no real message (it may seem like it does, but think about it; the notorious plot twist is empty). It could have succeeded as a horror film, but then decides it wants to be something else; it never fully becomes that 'something else,' though. If M. Night Shyamalan establishes himself as a real legend, I think this will be remembered as one of his minor achievements."
4,"Let me down, yet good movie!","First off I thought the movie was all about monsters and demons. Then after seeing the movie I was like ""Dude, rip off"", yet I enjoyed the movie. Ok, many people who I know said that the movie is horrible, maybe they are expecting to see what I was expecting, a monster movie filled with gore and action. I knew something like that was not going to happen, knowing what M. Night Shyamalan is capable of. Great story and visuals, from the monster to the setting of the movie. I love all of M. Nights' movies, can't wait for M. Night's next movie ""Lady In The Water""."
4,Gripping and Prophetic,"Gripping and suspenseful, ""The Village"" tells the story of a small settlement of people whose attempt to escape the evil world around them is haunted by a dark secret. The use of color and soundtrack to carry the plot is genius, and actors Howard, Brody and Phoenix put on a masterful performance. Camera work allows the viewer's imagination to connect the dots of the plot, only to have all important connections broken and reconnected differently in the final ten minutes. Shymalan is master of the multi-twist ending.Whether intentionally or not, ""The Village"" raises several important questions regarding the nature of human society and transcendent virtue. For a more thoughtful viewing, I would recommend first reading ""The Abolition of Man"" by C.S. Lewis. We, America, are the village.ALong"
5,more than twists and shock,"This movies is definitely a favorite of mine but not for the usual reasons. The Village is more about purity of heart and the sacrifices made for love than terror or regret. I love the concepts and values interwoven in the strange plots of the director, who has become famous for twists and shocks. I have to admit that the idea of creatures in the woods frightened me, however, the idea of losing what's dearest--one's character--was more upsetting. I love the characters, the score, and the plot and hope that everyone will give this movie a chance."
2,"A ""Sleeper"" Film","This film was a sleeper--literally. OK, so I was really tired when I watched it, I fell asleep about 40 minutes into it, and woke up near the end. Not only did I have a good nap, but I spared myself the utter pretentiousness of this film, whose visual interest quickly wears thin in the absence of any meaningful character or plot development.While I am a huge fan of M. Night Shamalan's earlier works, I felt betrayed that this was marketed as a horror film, when the scariest thing about it is that I actually paid to rent it. Far from his best work, the film lumbers along, and upon waking, my wife brought me up to speed on the plot twists in about two sentences. Perhaps the most glaring testament to the film's ineptness is that it did not even sustain my curiosity enough to want to review what I had missed the following day. If you're into movies with silly fixations on color and dress from an indeterminate period, then you may enjoy this. I preferred my nap, however."
5,Shirley from Maryland,"I remeber when this movie was first advertised. I started watching thinking that it would be horror, but pleasantly and surprising it was worth watching to the end. I suggest that when viewing stay with it. As usual the ending will surprise you just as the Bruce Willis ""Sixth Sense"" did. Remember, the banging, how scared the villagers were, but above all ""the box""."
3,Social Control through Storytelling,"Not particularly interesting;Understood what the director tried to say;To be honest, bored and irrated for storytelling was too slow and the narrative was too plastic.A village socially engineered and controlled by a few ""good"" men and women (""elders""): fictional Hutterites or Amish?Please, do not say that this is for the intellectual;Yes, this can be called a parable, but weak and loose."
1,need to fall asleep fast?,"about as scary as a wet sponge...ending about is shocking as two wet sponges...dialouge about as intense as three wet..., well you get the idea...out of sominex, pop this baby in the dvd player and you're on your way to snoozeville"
1,The Village was on the same level as Gigli,"Where to start? Lame story, extremely predictible twist, horrible ending, awful dialouge, not scary at all, boring as hell and the list goes on. It took me the whole movie to figure out if the blind chick was really blind, and I'm still not positive, but if she was she did a horrible job. So basicly this was without a doubt, absolutly one of the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and really wish i could get my $7.00 back. The only thing that made the movie tolerable was adrian brodies character because it made the movie funny, which im positive wasn't on purpose. Hey, M. Night, you screw up on this on."
1,Death by boredom,"Whoa, what a stinker.the film is very looonnngggg. In reality, it is only 2 hrs, but to the viewer that 120 min is an eternity. Blind girl in the woods? why?Incidentally, i watched this right after Anacondas 2 and that film was far superior to this one.Go figure."
1,Horrible!!!!!,This movie is so pathedic it was so stupid I mean it wasn't even scary. I thought it would be very scary but it was so stupid. Everybody in my school thought it was stupid to please don't waist your time watching this movie!!!From:Tucker Pace
1,Bad...,"I saw previews and this movie looks good. I went and saw it dispite bad reviews.It starts out REALLY slow. Then, it really starts to pick up and get ""creepy."" then, it becomes so lame again, and becomes good, and then somthing happens that killed the whole movie.let me say that this movie is more funny than scary. At a serious part where the creatures inside the woods were attacking, me and my friends and a ton of people in the theatures were laughing so hard, when we should have been terrified.But you still should see it just so you can be a art of discussions, but I highly recomend u wait for it to come out on dvd then rent it.This movie could have been awesome, but like i said, one thing just kills the movie, and made it seem that the 2 hours spent watching it was for nothing."
2,SHAKY GROUND,"M. Night Shymalan's clever plotting may have come to an end with the overly amibitious, and ultimately ridiculous The Village. Part parable, part sermon and a load of you know what, this claptrap doesn't even come close to the highs of The Sixth Sense or moments in both Unbreakable and The Signs, though with each movie, the device is wearing thin. The revelation here is Bryce Howard, who is lovely and excellent in a difficult (to put it mildly) role. The cinematography looks beautiful and the sounds provide some fun diversion, but long before this movie is over, you will be smirking in your seat."
3,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE....,"FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE M. NIGHT MOVIES! I THINK THAT HE IS ONE OF THE BEST DIRECTORS THERE IS, BUT THIS MOVIE WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.THERE IS SO MUCH HYPE ABOUT THIS MOVIE TO BE SCARY AND AWESOME, BUT I'LL TELL YOU, I ONLY JUMPED ONCE AND IT WAS NOT SCARY AT ALL SAY LIKE ""SIGNS"" WAS.I DO HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE STORYLINE IS EXCELLENT, BUT I WISH THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN IT SUCH A BIG HYPE, BECAUSE I AM A DIE HARD HORROR FAN, AND I WAS EXPECTING TO BE SCARED, BUT THIS MOVIE JUST DID NOT DO IT FOR ME."
1,A bad movie but its misrepresentation makes it the worst,"I think that this is the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen many bad movies. Though I think that what makes it so bad is that its marketed in a way to make people expect something that in now way, shape or form is delivered. This aspect of it pissed me off because I grew sleepy with the film but stuck with it to see how it ended but the ending just annoyed me. Completely false advertising- the advertising for it is so off that it deserved to be pulled of the market the way other items (not DVD's) are when they do such."
1,ripoff.,"This would be somewhat entertaing(if nothing else) but I can't get over the fact it's a complete ripoff(without giving any due credit) to Margaret Peterson Haddix's novel, ""Running out of Time"". And the novel, was in fact, more complex, more entertaining, more satisfying, more poignant, with more depth, then this movie."
4,Waste of Money,"What a waste of Money. I thought it was going to be good. Shame on me for reviewing something without seeing it. Big No-no and I won't do it again. Rented it and thought cool it was going to be a werewolf movie or something like that and its nothing of the sort. It's a mundane, slow movie. Ugh! The documentary on Sci-fi channel about M. Night Shyamalan was so much more scary. Save your money on this stink bomb."
2,oh please!,"the movie barely gets a two! if i were as dumdb as the blind girl, id kill myself. and also, what makes a retarded boy incapable of murder. the only good part was the part when the blind girl's sister got rejected by rasheed or whoever. he cant help if he doesnt want her. she's going to ask her father to give his blessing for her marriage, when she wasnt even proposed to! man. i guess the whole town was dumb."
2,Plot and dialogue both incomprehensible,This wa a horror movie with no thrills. Since everyone already guessed that the monsters weren't real to begin with all we were left with to amuse ourselves were the characters and dialogue -- both of which were boring. And the plot just didn't make any sense in the end. If the elders could have easily gone and gotten the medicine -- why did they insist on sending the blind girl? What was the point of that? She was the least likely to make it to the towns and the most likely to blow their secret once she got there even if she did happen to run into a security guard. It just didn't make any logical sense.
2,"might have been okay with better dialogue, hard to believe as is",This is the monster movie that wasn't. And why can't they talk like normal people. I had a hard time staying awake.
5,The Village,"The movie is about the powers of love, not fright. Yes, this is not a horror movie (I too was disappointed), but it had to be advertised as such. Otherwise, the twist would have been given away.As some of my friends disliked the movie with passion, I loved it. I thought it was incredibly smart and intensely moving. The protagonist is a blind young girl that will go to unimaginable extents to rescue the love of her life.I found the parallels in this film quite potent. The power of instilling fear in society, the power of denial, the power of conviction and ultimately the power of love were all depicted with sheer finesse. Aside from some really bad acting (what's wrong Sigourney Weaver?), the movie was impeccably beautiful.Go see it with an open mind and you will love it. Go see it expecting a horror film and you will hate it. It's your call."
1,...only one reason i finished watching this movie...,"...just to see how much worse it was going to get!!! if there was ever a movie that i've wanted to write a letter demanding not only my money back - but all those painful minutes spent watching back in my life. this movie made me angry. i seriously believe that a bunch of really bored stoners sat around and one of them said - 'hey - i've got this great idea for a movie - it's about these people that wanna live back like in simpler times...only, there's this creature that's not really a creature at all'...SO LAME! save your time, money, and intelligence...not worth watching - even on tv - even on a sunday when you're really bored and don't feel like doing anything else and there's absolutely nothing else on tv...and all your books and games have been stolen...and you have no paper or pens to write a letter...and your computer is busted...and your phone is dead...you're better off staring at the wall! yes, it's THAT bad."
2,Don't Bother to Go Into the Woods,"As everyone has been saying, I have been really disappointed with this movie. Why? 1. The beginning of the movie goes on and on and on and nothing exciting happens for a long time. 2. The ""twist"" (which is truly predictable) is not fufilling or climactic or satisfying 3. the film is not scary, spooky, 0r enlightening as Shyamalan and his previews hinted 4. It was not worth 8 bucks 5. a good 85% of the characters are as flat as a pancake 6.Many ""name"" actors are underused extremely. Why did they even do the movie if they didn't even have a part.Okay, the bashing has ceased. Why did i give it 2 stars instead of one? 1. The main actress is excellent 2. Joaquin's few scenes are pretty good 3.Some parts at the beginning are interesting (some should not be taken lightly)"
1,This is the WORST movie I've ever seen!,"I'm just like all of the others. I loved 6th sense, and have been attending Night's movies ever since, watching them get progressively worse. This one took the cake. The plot is so predictable. If you've ever watched an ordinary made for TV movie, you'll have this figured out in the first 15 minutes. If you work for your money, why would you ever consider wasting it after reading this harsh, yet truthful review?"
1,Worst film of all time,"Director Shama-lama-ding-dong is far too preoccupied with the strange twist ending. Watch any episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" for the same effect in one-third of the time. Nearly as bad as ""Signs."""
1,As bad as the critics said,"Boring, unsuspenseful, unscary. I had high expectations for this film, but was extremely disappointed. You can see ""the twist"" from a mile away--and it's just as you suspected. Why couldn't there had been ""real"" monsters in the woods????"
1,"A long, boring soap opera","This is the worst movie I've seen since ""House of the Dead"". This movie was pitched as being a ""supernatural thriller"". There is nothing scary, supernatural OR thrilling about this stink bomb. Instead, the viewer is given a boring love story with no more than 10 seconds screentime of ""monsters from the woods"". Of course, the ""monsters"" aren't even real, just villagers in costumes. Save your money for a real thriller and don't waste time out of your life to watch this garbage."
1,VILLAGE IDIOT,"I can't help but think of all the people going into this film expecting to see a scary monster. The only scary monster is the hyped up advertising which seems to promise fear, scare, and psychological suspense beyond belief. More like boredom beyond compare. I've seen this story of an Amish-type society building a rural utopian dream only to be threatened by the same social element it ran from many times before, but never so massively produced and pretentiously executed as it is in this pseudo-intellectual, swath of artistic pomp. Your worst fears do come true here when absolutely nothing happens and the red herrings grow to the size of whales. And how does Adrien Brody manage to play a village idiot without any character whatsoever?"
1,About as scary as an infomercial,"I rented this movie based on several movie reviews. The movie isn't intense, isn't scary, isn't even particularly interesting. The ending is odd, and that's all. I only gave it 1 star because the system doesn't allow negative stars."
1,What????,"I'm just not understanding where all these high rankings are coming from. Were you people watching the same movie I was? I should have known off of the back of the case. It sounds like something out of a fairytale, with an enchanted forest in all. The build up was ok but the monsters looked like something out a of low budget high schooler's english project. The movie was way too slow. I couldn't understand what year it was supposed to be because in their little village they were stuck in the 1800's but when Ivy got to the outside, the rest of the world was in 2000 something. I recommend watching something else. Anything else."
2,"""Signs"" is still Manoj's worst film","I thought the red-robed creature was effectively chilling. And it does have the beautiful Judy Greer (mmmmmmm, HERE ""Kitty""!). What is up with Ivy? She can see just fine for the first half hour of the film (Note how EASILY and SWIFTLY she darted away from Brody and RAN across the field), THEN goes BLIND?!?!?! WHAT???? I hated the dialogue (Is there not a single contraction within this film? I do not think so). How does Joaquin Phoenix keep getting work? Like his character in Signs, ALL of his lines are spoken with a trembling over-seriousness. Most of all I hated Shyamalamadingdong's insistence on putting himself in the film yet again. Once again, the extras are few. No commentary - again. Manoj really DOES want to be like Spielberg! The cinematography and music are satisfying, making it half-way watchable."
1,You DON'T get what you pay for!!!,"I was so disappointed in this movie!! I was ready for a good scare, and got...nothing!! The whole group of people who had rushed in to see this ""horror"" flick, were all disappointed!"
2,They botched the ending.,The ending was bitched....spoilerWhen the girl went over the wall..she should have met the old guy not the young guy and she he would know what was going on in the village..that would make mores sense then having the youg guy helping her...But he needed to get himself in the film
2,Spookfest? You gotta be Kiddin Me,"I dont know what all the hype is about surrounding M. Night Shyamalan's films. So far ive seen Signs and recently The Village- Neither of these films impressed me or scared me. This movie was long, boring and Not at all scary. Why is this man praised as a director? He shoots scenes of the woods for like 10 min straight. Yea , like that adds atmosphere. The monster in the red cape was laughable. The ending was so predictable and done before that you ask yourself is this it? Very long tedious and boring. Uneventful , Not scary. Ridiculous dialoge. Same with the ending in M. Night Shymalan's Signs. Stay far away from M. Night Shyamalan's films unless you want to be bored out of your mind."
2,Surprised,"Surprised M.Night would take so long to write a basically made for TV movie.I'm a big fan,but when the story unfolded and the truth came out,my daughter and i looked at each other and could not believe our eyes.At the end of the movie there was nothing but boos coming from the crowd.On the other hand the budget for this film was low so M banked a huge profit for his effort.Good business.Hes talented and i'm sure his next film will be a good one.This review pertains to the movie not the dvd."
3,THE MOVIE WAS GOOD BUT..... (CONTAINS SPOILER),"I went into this movie expecting to see a cool and mysterious monster movie but what I got was the feeling that I had been tricked. Every commercial that I ever saw about this movie led me to believe that there was a scary monster in the woods and that this was going to be some sort of supernatural monster movie, but when you get right down to it, all this movie is, is a drama with a twist. The whole movie Shamalan kept you guessing but basically he just led you to believe that the monster was real, then it wasn't, then it was, then it wasn't!!!When I left the theater I felt cheated. I have to admit, there were some good scares and it was a well written story, but every single article,trailer and review for this movie are hugely misleading."
1,Not a horror movie-the preview was misleading,"ALthough ""The Village"" did have wonderful cinematography and an underlying story of facing your fears for the ones you love, I expected it to be a horror movie. I was waiting for some sense of action or suspense in the movie and this did not happen once. This was the first movie that I almost fell asleep watching. I was ready for it to finish. I'm glad that I saw it on employee preview night. It just went on and on. Thats just IMHO though. If you liked ""Signs"" or any of the book to movie adaptations of Bronte, I recommend this movie."
1,An awful film,"First of all, Shyamalan is a great filmmaker, but I hated this movie for one reason: the major twist. Now twists are good, if they are used right, as in The Sixth Sense. But this twist, and I won't give it away, is so unbelievably ridiculous that it completely negates the entire movie. There is no plausable way that this movie could work. The first two thirds of the movie is very entertaining, with good performances by Joaquin Phoenix and a very good performance by Adrien Brody, but once the monsters are out of the picture, it takes a deep dive into awfulness never to recover. The Village is definitely M. Night's worst film, and it serves as one of the worst films of 2004. Never in my life have I seen so much potential wasted by such an unbelievable movie. I hated it."
1,Waste of my time,"I fell almost fell asleep in the theater, this movie gives the name ""boring"" a new meaning. The director did his best to completely make this movie soooooo stupid...man waste my 9 bucks"
2,WHAT A LET DOWN...,I WAS PRETTY EXCITED WHEN THIS CAME OUT FOR IT LOOKED REALLY COOL! WHAT A LET DOWN. THREE THUMBS DOWN!
1,Had a Lot of Potential,"I slid this movie into my player with the same expectations of most of the reviewers here - expectations fueled by chilling ads.What I got was something that might frighten a sheltered four year-old. The box promised I would be ""stunned"" by this one and I was, just not in the way I was looking forward to.The premise had a lot of potential to be scary, stunning, and chilling but didn't come close. I wouldn't have been so dissapointed had all the advertising not built this up to be a ""spine tingler."" That's why I rented it. 90 minutes into the film I was still waiting for that first tingle.The movie in one word - dumb. Thank goodness I used a 99-cent coupon for this one.If anything salvages this drama whatsoever it is the wonderful performance of Bryce Dallas Howard - which is akin to throwing pearls at swine. I look forward to seeing her in a better vehicle in the future."
2,Would work better in a different venue.,"If ""The Village"" had instead used the premise of a late 20th Century group of Amish extremists, replete with a visit from Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, this could have made a typical episode of the ""X-Files"". I kept feeling as though ""X-Files"" creator Chris Carter and M. Night Shyamalan had likely collaborated on this one."
4,Is mostly just a drama and a good one,"A lot of people are disapointed in the Village. Although I was disapointed in the twist, it still didn't ruin the movie for me. It's not M. Night Shyamalan's best horror movie or thriller because it's more than a drama than anything. It's still not a bad movie however because the direction is really good and as is the performances. Bryce Dallas Howard is excellent in a break-through performance as a blind women. William Hurt is really good as well as her father. Joaquin Phoenix is good too but don't be fooled this isn't his movie it's Howard's. If you don't expect monsters or aliens and if you can accept it as just a drama you'll enjoy the Village."
3,Keep your expectations low,"I waffle between the idea that this movie was truly disappointing, or was it actually okay but expectations were just too high. I expected something completely different, but I guess that was M. Nights point. The overkill from the marketing makes it difficult to say whether or not it was any good. It is indeed pretty to watch, but it just has this very phony feeling to it. There are not any really scary moments, and I had to laugh at the mysterious red caped creature which immediately brought to mind Nicolas Roeg's murderous dwarf in ""Don't Look Now"". I also think the directors affection for casting himself is really quite distracting. M. Nights other films were much more entertaining and seem to stick with you. This one is easily forgotten."
2,Does not pique interest,"There's nothing behind the shroud of this film that is worth any praise. There is some mystery behind the fear of these trapped villagers; but there is not one developed character in the plot that strikes concern. This film is a crock pot full of sticks, rocks and a little magic that goes no where."
3,slippery slope...,"I've enjoyed all of M. Night Shyamalan's films, but each one is a little weaker than the last. I'm glad I did not shell out money to see The Village at the movie theater. I'd recommend renting or watching this film on cable, but I would only buy it if were collecting Shyamalan's films or were a big fan of one of the stars. The film started out well enough, but became somewhat predictable. Sure the 'twist' at the end was interesting, but less remarkable than those from MNS's previous works. Overall, I'd say The Village is a watchable film...3-3.5 stars"
3,Not Night's best but....,"My hat's off to M. Night for sticking to his minimalist guns and trying... with every film he writes and directs, he TRIES...What I like about his films is how he lays the pieces of a puzzle for you and forces you to interact. (unless you like films like ""Dude, where's my Car?"" in which case, there's no hope for you) He takes the story conventions and constructs his own frankenstein monster.But like the monster itself, he leaves details and plot lines un-mended hoping you won't take a second look. Night is a talented individual who's best is still to come and in time I hope he relies less on smoke and mirrors.He's a good shooter and man can he inject heart in his films.. imagine what he can do with a tighter plot?*** honorable mention: Bryce Dallas Howard's debut is worth seeing."
3,"Not the best, yet not the worse.","This movie was disappointing. I didn't like the Sixth Sense and never saw Signs. Yet, this movie just was disappointing. You totally know the ending if you pay attention at the begining (I won't spoil it for those who want to see it). Beware it was not scary.The previews had hyped this movie up so much that it looked amazing! I am suprised that I stayed the whole time. Yet-it wasn't. Even looking at the previews currently showing it looks like something I would love to see--but I don't care to watch it again.It is your call on this movie--some people who I talked to loved it; others were like me and thought it was a joke. It is one you will have to decipher on your own."
1,did not like,I did not like this movie at all. at first i thought it was gonna be creepy. creatures runnin around in the woods terrifying people. the big porcupine things were kinda foolish looking. then when i found out it was the actually villagers dressing up to keep the other villagers in the village and it was present day! kinda silly did not enoy.
3,Not Shyamalan's Best (spoilers),"I feel that Shyamalan has missed for the first time for me. I am tired of people complaining about the ending. They say it's no longer scary. But if you think about it, The Sixth Sense is no longer scary at the end because we have been following a ghost and know ghosts don't want to harm, rather they just want to be helped. The problem with this one is that he has taken an idea that has already been used and never admitted it. The book was called Running Out of Time where a girl is in a village and needs to go get medicine, but when she leaves she discovers she is in present time. It is done differently, but nonetheless it's the same idea. Very disappointing to see Shyamalan do that. I do understand the metaphor, which is a beautiful message, but I don't like him taking ideas. The directing is great and when watching it you really feel like you are in the setting of the film. I would recommend people to watch it, but don't expect it to be a great Shyamalan film."
1,The worst movie I've EVER EVER seen this entire year!!!,"I don't understand it. It was kinda freaky in the beginning, but before the end even came, I was sound asleep. The characters were a bore (besides Adrien Brody but what was he trying to prove by being so damn weird anyway?) and the scenes made me scratch my head every damn time.I don't understand the plot nor the point of the movie.It made me so mad, cause I hear my cousin and my mother loved it. I felt completely turned off watching it!Cover Art: D- (stupid comes to mind)Inside Art: ? (Won't ever buy this piss-poor review)Comic Relief: F-Story: FCharacters: F+Length: F-1.1 stars.Overall: F-"
4,Brilliant and clever,"I've read some of the many critiscms from other people on this board about The Village, and really can't understand it. Those who say it's not scary enough are really missing the point. OK, so it's being marketed (rather inaccuratly) as a thriller, but it's so much more then that. It's deep and philosophical, and very very clever, and I for one couldn't see the big twist in the story coming. I don't know why some people could as it wasn't the most obvious thing at all. Brilliant brilliant film, and those who keep banging on about it being rubbish really are not understanding the film at all. The performances are first rate, and though it took me a while to get into, once things kick off, it really is something you could discuss all day. A first rate film."
3,"Interesting, but too drawn out.","this movie had a good plot, was semi-original (which is hard to come by now-a-days), but it was very drawn out. It seemed like he wrote an hour long (really 45 minute with commercials) episode of ""The Outer Limits"" but made it longer to fill in 2 hours."
2,Dissappointing,"I like M. Night Shyamalan.........i liked sixth sense, unbreakable, and signs.......the village was a dissappointment. It was interesting until he threw in a twist. It didnt really even make sense......i mean c'mon , the main actor almost gets cut out of the story completely, for real!! haha....also, when the blind girl goes into the shed with her father, she says she smells an odd smell ......you would figure it's death......come to find out theyre costumes. those who have seen the movie would understand. I had to check the back of the DVD to see if it was PG....i mean, this is a freakin love story at best. sorry M. Night,........better luck next time."
1,It's a shame anyone found the village ....,"What a complete and utter waste of time. After the revelation of Sixth Sense and suspense of Signs all that this film has to offer is a lot of Blair Witch style hype, but with a Hollywood price tag.I remember seeing some spoof documentary about the film, how difficult it was to nail down M. Night to an interview and some dark secret he kept. What a lot of twaddle.Well, I got suckered into buying this latest offering but should have known better when I saw the cast. William Hurt's performances are enough to dull any plot. Fortunately for him, this film just doesn't seem to have any."
2,What a let down,"This movie presents itself as a unique, genuine scare/thriller, but what you get is a slow-paced dud with an obvious, predictable plot. The acting/dialogue is tedious and at times painful to hear, the storyline dead-ends in the middle of the movie; overall, this is not worth your time or money."
1,I wish I could give it a 0,"This movie is just total crap. It started off so good, amazing even. The acting was phenomenal, I will even give it that.It wasn't until the ""twist"" when everything went horribly wrong. When it ends it even leaves a big question behind, and not the obvious one the actors point out. I am so tempted to leave spoilers, but others might like it and I woulnd't want to spoil it for them. What I will say is don't spend 8-20 bucks (ticket, popcorn, etc.) to go see it. Just wait until it comes out on video, and not just that, wait until it's at the 1 dollar rental section in Blockbuster or wherever you rent."
1,The Village Stinks,"There isn't a whole lot to comment on. The movie stinks. I love movies and even enjoy some that other do not. The only thing I can say is the actors took the money and ran. They got the best end of this deal. The movie was slow to start, the plot was weak. Based on this story I would probably never read or go to another movie by this writer."
2,the village,"When this film finally ends and it says an M. Night Shyamalan film... you just feel strange... as if you've just bought a Jaguar, but it runs like a Geo Metro.I'm not going to go into details of plot or what this movie tries to do or doesn't do right. Plain and simple, it's just not good. Anyone who says it's good is really reaching like a parent picking out the few good qualities in their bratty, ugly children. Of course, there are a few things done well... other than that it's a waste of time. I'd rather have watched Unbreakable or 6th sense over again instead of wasting my 2 hours on this."
1,The Movie Watching Experience We Do Not Speak Of,"I rented this movie from Blockbuster and brought it to a family gathering last night. Popped it in the DVD player ... slowly but surely most of the family got bored and left the room. Only my mother and I made it to the end. We agreed that it was one of the worst films either of us had seen.M. Night Shyamalan must have a lot of relatives judging from the number of positive reviews for this dog of a movie. Either that, or there truly is ""a sucker born every minute"".This is simply a bad movie from any rational perspective."
1,Yawnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.,"Wow, this movie was absolutely HORRIBLE, it was soooooo boring it literally PUT ME TO SLEEP!! yes I fell asleep in the theater and the next thing I knew I was being shooken awake. M. Night Shamali is overrated. His movie Signs SUCKED, but at least I could stay awake. This movie's plot was awful. I'm sorry, but for the 45 min or so I did stay awake NOTHING scary happened. When I left the movie I seriosly asked if it was supposed to be a horror movie. M. Night. Shamali, Sixth Sence was pretty good, but what happened? :>)"
2,"I wanted to throw my popcorn at the screen, I was so mad!","Is it just me, or does the plot of this movie just SEEM identical to RUNNING OUT OF TIME by Margaret Peterson Haddix? People are living in a community that is, in reality, a social experiment. They run out of medicine, a young girl is sent out to get stuff they need (in defiance of the leaders)... Heyyyyy, wait a minute! Yup! It's the same damn story."
5,The Village DVD,DVD was perfect as described. I am pleased with my purchase and will buy from again. Thank you.
2,Waste of my five dollars and fifty cents!!!,"This film was boring, its about these people who have to seperate themselves from the other side of the town because of this one moron who they think is a monster(but isnt really), and hes actually on thier side of the town. I wish i could get my money back, dont even rent this movie. 1 1/2 stars."
1,:-(,"Well, I was kind of liking the movie up until the end, when you find out that the whole thing was just a scam. There was no monstor, and it was just the elders trying to scare the young ones in a suit. That was the wost movie ending ever."
1,leave the village,"the scariest thing about The Village is that i wasted the time and money to watch it. this movie really does not have a plot..the movie itself is basically just an excuse to make a ""twist"", one which you can see coming from miles away. the whole endeavor is incredibly dull, plodding, and pointless. Bryce Dallas Howard's performance is the one bright spot in an otherwise terrible film. let's hope that producers can see past the rest of this garbage and get her a better vehicle next time."
2,"Yet another ""could have been a great movie""","M. Night is losing it, as far as making movies goes. I was really impressed with Sixth Sense, so as with most his fans. His movies are slowing degrading in his story lines. I think he is running out of 'material'.Disappointing in a word.Though it had promise.This movie starts with a kind of ""hunh?"" thought.. and ends with a ""unghh.. "" feel.It starts out visually appealing with a range of familiar faces. Slowly it gains momentum before screeching to a halt and leaving one to wonder ""why?"" Why is the movie still going on? why am I no longer interested in what happens? Why are the best characters so under developed?The Village is one of the most boring movies I've seen in recent years. The pace is so slow and annoying that it makes ""The Sixth Sense"" look like an action movie. The so called twist towards the end of the movie is so predictable that you'll have to shut your brain completely not to see it coming"
1,''don't let them in'' by anthony m jones,"When I saw the trailer for this I was thinking yahh M night Shymalan's made another pants wetting movie. Well I watched the movie and after the 1rst hour it got flat out boring. This is no horror this is a mockery of horror. The movie did have some suspenceful moments but its just not enough. If I could i'd give it a half of a star. Its basically just about a girl who is in love with this boy the boy get stabbed and she must venture into the forrbidden woods were the so called monsters wait ,to get medicine to heal the one she loves, the movie flips the script on you at first you are thinking that its a horror then it turns into a romantic love story what a let down.I know you are probably thinking that it can't be that bad ,after all were talking about the man who created Signs and the Six Sense which were both creepy movies. Now don't get me wrong I think M Night Shyamalan is a genius but he really made a mistake here."
2,What was he thinking?,"The problem was with the script. Every time some new twist was about to be revealed through suspenseful action, Shamalyan cut to a different scene where the ""secret"" was being revealed through exposition. He stole his own thunder several times!Unlike ""The Sixth Sense,"" the twist of this film is obvious in the first 20 minutes. You just have to listen to the language used for backstory whenever a character takes the opportunity to explain his/hers.Ms. Howard made the whole film. Hurt is becoming like Jack Nicholson -- plays himself in every film. Weaver was wasted. Character acting by supporting cast was solid. Phoenix didn't have a lot of scope. Brody's performance was also solid."
3,"I was disapointed, but I had a good time.","The Village had a disapointing surprise ending. If Shyamalan didn't end the movie the way he did it The Village would have been a great film. I am not going to tell you how it ended, but I'll just say he could've ended it by saying ""it was all a dream,"" and it would've been just as good of an ending. Although I had a fun time. A few parts made me jump, but it isn't that scary compared to ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs."""
2,The Village-Im very disappointed after a long wait,"This movie is certainly not what you expect it to be(unless you hate Shyamalan). From the amazing preview of the village, I was expecting a really good movie. I was waiting to see this one for months...To make a long story short, this movie has alot less scares then what I anticipated. The movie started out slower then hoped and while you wait for it to get better, it only gets worse. A potential scarefest turned into a realistic borefest. The terrible ending only makes you hate the movie even more...Shyamalan seems to be the Mike Tyson of movies. He started out great, but fizzled out fast. He will still be able to sell tickets to future shows, but with every show he will lose credibility in his profession...Casting=4.5 starsending=1 starsplot & storyline=2 starsreplay value=1 starsOVERALL= 2 Stars"
2,It was really confusing and NOT scary at all,"it was okay, i mean it had a good vibe to it but it was supposed to be scary and it was more like a drama than a horror. I didn't really enjoy it at all. if you're lookin for a horror movie, don't watch this."
4,Awesome!,"Another hit! This movies was not as scary as I expected it to be, but still made me jump here and there. With a surpising, yet silly ending, this movie blew me away! The creatures in this film were amazing looking. I enjoyed this film and would watch it over and over."
4,"a bone chilling, hair on your back raising thriller diller!","once again, i went in with a low and dubious expectation; gues what= i loved it completely. it was deeply creepy and thrilling with not one but two total surprises as the climax approached! the acting by everyone, especially ms. howard was superb. the film was so very atmospheric, eerily beautiful especially on the dvd=oh and by the way the ex digital sound-be prepared to be blown away by the bass, etc. everything added up to make the village a real bone chilling thriller! i wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone=you must see it, feel it, experience it for yourself. in this case, it's what we don't see that's the most frightening. it's a real winner and looking at the lines today at best buy-flying off the shelves, it's going to be the 1st real smash hit dvd of the new year! try not to watch it alone, however."
5,Spine Tingling Thriller,"The movie was amazing! It is not as scary as the cover looks, it has more of an anti-utpian theme going on. The story line really makes you think, not just during the movie, but after, it grips you and never lets go. The idea I got from it was just how hard lose feels to people and how some go to extremes to feel at peace with themselves again. Many people hate the ending though it doesn't really bother me(it has the Gone With the Wind type of ending), it lets the audience think for themselves on what should or will happen next. What I hope, is that M. Night Shyamalan will consider making a second. He left off at such a cliff hanger that the possibilites of what can happen next are endless."
5,Let in the light,"Okay--let's try this: It's a gothic romance about damaged people. And aren't most of us in that boat? Will we let Ivy go and get the medicine? Or will we allow our fears to continue to control us? Since precious few movies ever break upon the boundaries of serious thought, since soulfulness is almost entirely absent in Hollywood today, and since this movie has the courage to declare that ""the whole world bows before love"": 5 stars."
3,An extremely unusual movie (for better or for worse),"I can't recall a movie quite like 'The Village'. The first two-thirds are interesting and well-crafted but are undermined by a silly reveal and deterioration of the character development so compelling earlier in the film. From the looks of things since, the 'shocker' here may well be remembered as the beginning of the end of MNS's era of excellence. Unfortunately, sometimes those in the creative arts run out of good ideas but keep producing product. It happens to musicians, painters, writers and apparently film makers as well. Balancing a four for the first two-thirds and a low two for the final third, I give this three stars.....probably closer to two and a half. It's worth watching for Bryce Dallas Howard's breakthrough performance and because there are few, if any, movies quite like 'The Village'."
2,Eh...It was okay,The Village has a very decent story plot and the beginning through the scene where the creatures attack is scary as hell. The end however is a very not welcomed suprise. But to others it was a cool ending. I personally won't buy it on DVD but it is definately a rental. If you rent it and don't like it just take it back and if you do like it then buy the DVD. But if you haven't seen the movie and don't know too much about it it is definately a rental.
5,Not what you were expecting?,"It seems that the many reviewers who did not like this film, or even (hard to believe) hated it, probably didn't get it. It goes so much deeper than just a plot twist. If that's all you were looking for, then you have a right to be disappointed. I viewed the film with no expectations and very little information about the plot (just the DVD jacket), and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by the many facets of this film. It is a masterpiece that I will be turning over and over in my mind for quite awhile."
4,Great movie,"If you're expecting a gory, bone-chilling movie about monsters terrorizing a town, you'll be very disappointed with Shyamalan's latest. The Village is actually a very well- put together love story with a few creepy events thrown in to keep you on the edge of your seats. And while the ending, doesn't have a twist near as good as the Sixth Sense, it wraps up agreat movie nonetheless. Also, the score for this film (by James Newton Howard) is amazing. Bryce Howard gives an Oscar worthy performance.4 stars!"
2,Scary boring,"This movie could have been cut down to about a 30 minute short, but instead Shyamalan decided to double space his way towards feature length in what was a very disappointing film. Firstly, I thought the movie was supposed to be a horror film, but there are really just a few scenes where suspense builds and quickly disperses.An interesting thing about this movie, there is a twist at the end that no one is going to see coming...unless you have some common sense and a bit of an imagination. Basically the end is predictable if you are able to remain awake for the duration. Also, watch for Shyamalan's forced little cameo.The only redeemable quality about this movie was the fact that it was technically sound. All the cinematography and audio and good stuff like that was decent, overall the production quality was high, I just felt that the movie itself was not entertaining."
2,"NOT EXACTLY THE BEST, BUT HAS IT'S MOMENTS","In the long run, this movie was quite a letdown. Unlike the fabulous SIGNS, this movie will scare you the first time only. The plot is very promising, as is the beginning of the film. A ninteenth century village is surrounded by a forbidden forest inhabited by vicious ""creatures"". Both have an understanding not to intrude upon eachother's area. But one night, the peace is broken...Sound spooky? Well, that's how the previews played it.I won't give anything away because this movie will scare the bejezus out of you then make you feel stupid for bein scared at the end. My problem is that after you see this movie once, it will never scare you again because you know how it will turn out. The magic of Shyamalan's scare tactics, which was worked o perfection in SIGNS, is that the threat is right around the corner and could jump out at any time - but it doesn't, and you can cut the tension with a knife. It works every time, but not in THE VILLAGE."
2,Awful writing makes this a disappointment.,"""The Village"" had potential. The story, set in an entirely isolated village, could have been made into a good movie, especially considering the talent involved. Shyamalan's directing is competent but his writing/dialogue is so bad ""The Village"" is unintentionally funny and impossible to take seriously. It has some of the most ridiculous and pretentious dialogue since the films of Ed Wood. Bryce Dallas Howard, however, delivers a good performance. The story tries to create some suspense but fails, and it all leads up to an ending that is a complete anticlimax. The certainly was no surprise ending like I had heard.""The Village"" is a disappointment. It doesn't work as horror, nor as drama nor as adventure. It seems to try to be deep but only manages to be pretentious and silly. Not recommended."
4,"Good Movie, but Terrible Microphone Shots!","I really did enjoy The Village, but my dad and I were cracking up because you can see the microphone in so many shots! This really is a good flick, but it isn't a horror movie, like the trailers lead us to believe. It is more suspensful and depressing. Good movie, go see it if you're an M. Night fan."
1,"Contrived, Disappointing, and a Waste of 104 Minutes","I thought ""The Sixth Sense"" was wonderful: well-done, scary, and with a twist that worked.This movie is no Sixth Sense. Only at the end is it quite obvious that most of the previous 90 minutes has merely been a set-up for the final ""no big deal"" twist. I won't give anything away in this review; that wouldn't be fair to you if you've yet to watch the movie.I'm surprised that actors like Hurt and Weaver would accept roles in such a drab script. Pan my review if you must; in the end, I'm sure that you, too, will feel that these 104 (or so) minutes could have been used doing something more productive or enjoyable."
2,It Takes a Village Idiot (aka Adrien Brody),"to get any action going in this lifeless pseudo-thriller from the self-loving M. Night S. Dull and utimately very predictable, there is absolutely no payoff here and very few chills along the way. It also has some major gaffs, like the town elders who know the truth and yet - there's a whole population of folks in the same age group who seem clueless as to what is going on. Hello? Were those folks drugged and kidnapped or something? You'll understand when the ""secret"" is revaled. Anyway, Brody's character is the only one who inspries any real action in the film, and, to be fair, Bryce Dallas Howard is very good actress and has a promising future.Self-indulgent and dull."
2,Disappointed,"I am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan, when I initially saw the preview for this movie I was so excited. Keeping with the way he directed ""Signs"" this movie was much like that, its obvious they were done by the same director, there are some similiaries.The idea for this movie was an interesting, unique one and pulled off well, however, there was a surprise twist (like all Shyamalan movies have) that took the movie in the wrong direction. If Shyamalan had left the twist out of the loop the movie would have been much better.Not as edge of your seat as his other movies, it wasn't as special as I had hoped it would be. My advice, wait for the DVD version..."
2,You'll Feel Cheated,"M. Night Shyamalan, you're no Alfred Hitchcock and after an interesting start this film pulls out the rug from under you and what seemed like the making of a good horror film is simply a dodge for pretty ordinary doings. I swore off this guy's movies after this one. Fool me once shame on you ..."
1,the worst movie of the year,PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOU TIME OR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE OR SHOULD I SAY PIECE OF S!@T.
1,A worst M . Night Shyamalan Movie.... Fool Me? I dont think,If you wanna Get a really scare.. whit horror... suspense and stuff.... DONT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!... Just rent.. I hahve a big disaponment whit Shyamalan....Its SO!! Slow. muchs muchs WORds... Much romantic momente..and stuff..... 1 or 2 time... suspene scenes... but the others..and The final.. SO STUPID!!!!!!!!!!! .... for all movie you believe in this people... they made believe live in 1700 or 1800 or in the middle of these years... and ITs PRESENT today!!!!!!!!!..I HATE THIS MOVIEE
1,The people who said this was good need to get serious help!!,"This is probaly the worst movie ever made, it made me sick! I can't understand anyone liking this horrible crap! the people who made this movie need to be exterminated like the roaches they are. First of all the movie made no sense and the people in it act retarded! also it is not scary at all, not to mention it was really boring and really really really stupid. I went to see it at the theater and i didn't even watch the last 20 minutes because i left due to the fact that I was tired of wasting my life away on such crap!!!DON'T LISTEN TO THE FREAKS WHO SAID IT WAS GOOD, THEY HAVE NO TASTE IN MOVIES DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE AWAY WATCHING CRAP LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A FILM FOR THE TRASH BIN,"An abysmal, overbloated failure with a plot lifted out of old Twilight Zone rejects. Laughable, hackneyed script. Worst film of 2004!Okay, good photography and ONE good performance (Howard) should not be enough for anybody. Brody is an embarrassment in probably the stupidest role in the history of the movies. Everyone else is wasted in parts that, to quote Roger Ebert, ""move below the one-dimensional and enter Flatland.""This is a mess of a failure so monumental it's amazing even one viewer hasn't angrily stomped out of the theater by midpoint. And the ending is so lame, so insipid, so unoriginal, so plain stupid that I am amazed it isn't laughed off the screen. A TERRIBLE STINKER that deserves total oblivion. They ought to pay you to watch this turkey."
1,A Piece of Crap,"The cast of the movie was fine,but one major problem,the script and the acting.Make that two major problems.When I saw the trailer to this movie I thought I was going to get a very scary movie like Alien,which by the way starred Sigourney Weaver who is in The Village.I would suggest to M. Night Shyamalan to go back to the drawing board and see where he went wrong in writing this movie.Adrien Brody's character nearly sank the movie and so did Bryce Howard's.She is a good actress,but what was her character doing in the woods?Alone?That's like having Luke Skywalker facing Darth Vader without using the Force.Or a drunk driver smashing in house and suing the owner."
1,So much promise - what a disappointment,"The village had a lot of great elements but they just didn't come together.* secluded community cut off from the world.* secretive controlling community council.* 'real' monsters in the woods.* forbidden buildings.As a horror movie this was a big stinker!As a drama - again stinker!Don't get me wrong, there were some really nice moments in it - that all added up to about 3 mins of film time.I have to wonder if the best parts of this story were never shot or ended up on the cutting room floor."
1,Overblown missmash.,"""The Village"" is a great example of what happens when a hot young director, in this case Mr. M. Night Shymalan, is give free rein and lots of money to create his masterpiece. With ""The Village"" Shymalan proves without a doubt that he is not infallible.While ""The Village"" is a beautiful to look at movie it fails entirely as either a love story or a horror story. The actors speak in a kind of pseudo Colonial American. The plot moves along at a snail's pace. The, so called, ""others of which we do not speak"" are neither scary nor are they paticularly threatening. The love story is down right silly. By the end of this mess I was joyfully rooting for the untimely death of the movie's young hero and heroine. I saw the twist at the end coming from almost the first frame.I suggest that you purchase the classic stinker ""Robot Monster"" instead. At least it's a funny bad movie. ""The Village is just a bad, bad movie."
1,I See Stupid People,"Okay, without giving away too much of the ""twist"" ending (and if you do not figure it out within the first half hour of the movie you may want to consider having a CAT scan), let me just ask this question: if the Elders of the Village are all in on the ""secret"", why didn't one of THEM go and get the medicine?In a nutshell, if anyone but M Night Shamalama-ding-dong had brought this pathetic script to a studio, he or she would have been laughed at. This is Grade Z material coated with a thin veneer of Grade A production values. Someone stop this man before he writes again, he clearly has no ideas left."
2,most disappointing movie of the year,"the village is about a small amish town that is surrounded by a forest. in this forest lives ""those we do not speak of"" the monsters have always lived in peace with the people of the village, but now the border has been compromised. and that is where the story nose dives.i was really excited to see the village, although i hated signs i still had faith that the village would be good. oh how wrong i was.the worst part of the movie is that m night shyamalan expects the audience to swallow all the crap that he dishes out. i think that he ran out of good ideas so now he just makes whatever pops into his head and collects the money.the only good thing about this movie is adrien brody's character. his performance is very entertaining, and is the only reason i would watch this movie again"
1,Oh Boy- Do I smell a lawsuit!!!!!!!!,"""The Village"" by M. Night Shyamalan was an excellent movie. The premise was fabulous- at least I thought so when I read it in ""Running Out of Time"" by Margaret Peterson Haddix. Can you say PLAGIARISM!!!!"
1,"numbingly dull script, poor direction","the director wieldeth powerful magic--he hath the power to turn sigourney weaver and william hurt into wooden boards, the talking kind. i hope he returned them to their original incarnations after the shoot. this is the kind of movie for which an actor should call in sick to the premiere."
1,WASTE OF CELLULOID!!,"I saw this film in the cinema and disappointment doesn`t come close! It was like blowing a balloon of suspense up for almost two hours to find it bursts at the last moment.Watch in awe...... as what promises to be a firecracker turns into a damp squib!Sit back in suspense......for 15 minutes!Let your arms grip the armrests.....as they go numb!Feel the tension......as you feel yourself ripped off!But above all, more than anything that has gone before..... feel the relief...........when the end credits roll!!Now buy the DVD it makes a neat frisbee or drinks coaster!!!"
1,What a Stupid Script and Director,"I don't know what the director was doing with this film.I ask myself; ""What are we watching here? A love story or a horror flick?""You cannot have both!! You have to have a good concept with good story line.I have to admit though that I did not know there was a modern city(like today) beyond the village.But still that was stupid!! That was like watching the 'The Truman Show' LOL!I do not want to go into more details but please ignore this stupid movie. You won't like it.This is much worst than 'Forgotten'!! Dumb Hollywood makes crap."
3,Taz-Maniac,"I received this in record time as usual, the tape does jump alot especially through the first two cartoons, after that it stops jumping, but that to be expected since the cartoon itself is an old one, but other then that, it's great!"
5,Awesome Cartoons,"I just love cartoons and I especially love Looney Toons and one of my regular pass times is waking up during anytime in the week and letting the kid out of me and watching a classic cartoon show. I loved this show when it was on tv and now that I own it I am going to hopefully soon buy the rest of them to add to my cartoon collection. The problems with tv today is that they think people will watch if you throw filth, sex, and curse words in their faces. Well, I hate today's tv because of the sex, vulgar words, and there are no more commercial jingles on that made watching tv awesome. The tv of today sucks and that is why I spend the money to buy programs I want to watch. Clean up your act FCC."
2,THAT'S ALL ABOUT THE ART,"The incredible reprinted art from a lot of old comics makes this book worthwhile. The text is very, very weak."
5,A book for any age!,"Sally Goes to the Mountains is a book I would give as a gift to any dog lover from 4 to 94. It's colorful illustrations, charming and witty captions, subject matter and size makes it the perfect coffee table book. I'll cherish mine forever. I can't wait for the next ""Sally"" book and plan to visit the huneck.com website to choose a special framed print from this very special book."
1,Weak copy of need for speed,"Everything about this game is lame, the graphics , the user interface, and the very slow since of speed, car's going 150 mph feel like 70 mph! you can pump up your ride to 600+HP! and cars with 200HP will beat you! If you are a fan of need for speed underground stay away from this stinker!! This game is very dissapointing! avoid it at all cost's!!!"
1,Why did i waste my money?,Nothing is worse than being in afghanistan and waiting for three weeks for it to show up in the mail. when it finaly got here i was able to play for about 30 min. before i broke the game it was that much of a disapointment. i mean how can you release a game after underground and claim that it is a contender. the makers of this game knew that people would buy this crap as a steping stone to the second need for speed.now on to the game the lengths you can modify your car are terrible and the selection of paint..............when you customize your car at the house you can paint it whatever color you want not to mention the body kits in the game there is no selection what so ever. i think people get my point by now.
4,Street Racing Syndicate Review,"This Xbox racing title is a good, if not great, game. I gave this game a 4 out of 5 stars because the cars look great and there is damage simulation. However, this game can be difficult to a beginner and when the cars are going 160 mph it looks like its 100 mph so not very good speed feeling if your car is slow. But after you get into this game it becomes very addictive because you can customize up to 50 cars and store them in your warehouse! I gave this game a 3 out of 5 for education because it teaches the player the physics and strategy of racing. I would give this game a 5 out of 5 for education, but since the theme is street racing, I lower cause it teaches kids to speed (not really, but I need an excuse). Thank you for reading my review and buy this game if you want a solid racing game for 50 bucks ($49.99)+Average durability+Fun and addictive game+On Xbox Live-Not as much customization as Need for Speed Underground?$49.99(Reviews based on Xbox version)"
4,good game,newbs think this game sucks but thats because they dont know crap about tuning up cars on this game the only down side of this game is that bodykits suck because they slow the car down because the game sees them as extra weight thats not making the car more aerodynamic.
2,S.R.S. Review,"The game was good, I have gotten to a point in the game where it's pretty hard to continue or beat the other racers. It's kind of hard to find the right car to upgrade to beat the other racers. The driving mechanics are very different from Need For Seed games, which I thought it would be similar, but it had no customization progression, just only to a limit."
1,Don't buy this item!!!!!,"I bought this product and what I received was a bottle full of water! And I bought the Intense Hydrating Treatment from the same seller too. The product was so weird and watery. I showed my hairdresser and he told me that this was not a real Joico product. This is such a shame! I felt cheated. If I could give 0 stars, I would!"
5,joico k-pak deep penetrating reconstructor (amazing hair product,the product arrived on time it was a fast delivery & just like i imagine the size!! it helps your hair become stronger & healthy. It contains a beautiful odor that will leave your hair looking & feeling soft with a delicious fragrant!! I really recommend this product!! I have been using it for several years!!
2,I don't think I got the real deal!!!,"This is the weirdest consistency ever.Like putting H2O on your hair!My first reaction was it can't be right and after reading other reviews I think I am right!The smell is odd not really bad just odd and I can live with that.But it has done NOTHING for my hair,NOTHING! Beware ladies:("
2,Not Impressed,"I bought this treatment hoping it would work wonders for my dry, damaged hair. After first use, I did not see any improvement in my hair. I thought that maybe it takes more than one time to see better results. I've been using it for over a month and my hair still looks and feels the same. The product smells nice, like bananas, but I do not like the watery consistency and texture. Maybe it's not working on my hair which was damaged from bleach and heat damage. The only thing that has helped my hair so far was hot oil treatments and frequent trims."
4,Very pleased with Joico K-pak Reconstructor,"Joico products have always worked the best on my hair. However, since I have been moving about the country, Joico has been hard to find sometimes. I was really pleased to discover that it was available through Amazon. This purchase was received promptly. The only issue that came up for me was the thickness of the K-pac. I thought I rememered it to be thicker. Nonetheless, it did the job and my hair is recovering its softness and sheen after the issues of dryness that it had had since my last perm.If you are constantly disappointed with other hair products, its worth the $12 to try this one."
1,Not the same as K-Pak Reconstructor in smaller tube,I have been a user of the K-Pak Reconstructor in the smaller tube size for a long time. I decided to buy the bigger size as it seemed like a better deal. It is definitely not the same product. It's not as thick and is very watery. My hair does not get as soft as with the smaller size tube product and I end up using much more of the product to compensate. Not worth the money.
1,Old product,"When I received this product, it was all weirdly textured, like it was very old. It was broken down and smelled weird. I used it anyway, might as well have used Suave. I have purchased this product from salons in the past and LOVED it, so I know that this stuff was either very old or fake. BEWARE!"
2,Not the same consistency as ones I bought in store,Not the same consistency as ones I bought in store. I purchased 2 tubes from this dealer and they are much more liquid than the thicker consistency I find when I purchase in a store such as Ulta. Dissapointed.
5,Very Good,I really like this product. It has really helped my dry damaged hair. My hair lacked a lot of moisture and this product has really helped it. I recommend using it 3 times a week for the 1st month in order to see good results.
1,Definitely not what I paid for..,Ive have had Joico's reconstructor before and know what to expect and this is DEFINITELY not that. Its as if something entirely different was put inside the package.. The smell and texture are entirely different...Needless to say I'm far less than thrilled..
3,Not a fan of Joico products,"I have never been a fan of Joico products. When I started getting my hair done with a new stylist she promoted the product so well that I thought I would try it again. The products are not bad they are just hard to use with my hair.Something to know about how to use this Reconstructor properly that it does not say on the bottle. Per my stylist, you must towel dry your hair before applying for access water with dilute the solution and it won't work. Keep the Reconstructor on for 5 minutes, wash it out and do this again for at least one more application if not two. If you use the product correctly it's works great! My hair looked great and it did the job.I give this 3 stars b/c I want a mask that doesn't take 15 minutes for it to work properly."
1,Disgusting,"I'm not sure if this was a scam or what, but I do not think the actual product was in the container I got. It smelled awful, it was runny, and had an odd color. I've used Joico products before. Maybe this was expired or maybe I got taken, but after one use I threw the rest of it away, Lord only knows what was in there that I was putting on my hair! NOT at all pleased, a huge waste of money! Buy these products at a licensed retailer, not on here!"
2,expired maybe?,I received this in a runny clotted condition. I am using it up anyway due to its small size but I am annoyed it's not right.
5,great product!,"Smells like bananas and helped strengthen my super processed hair! (My hair is naturally black, but i bleach it honey blond) It seemed like it might be a tad old bc it seemed like it separated a little but it still seemed to do the trick. I had to heavily moisturize tho afterward."
1,FAKE! Do not buy from seller!!,This stuff is nasty. The product in the bottle is fake. It is watery and doesn't help reconstruct your hair at all. I've used it before and loved it when I bought at a real salon...Either this seller is tampering with the product or it's super old.
3,Wonderfully written but a downer,"I thought this was a very well-written book. The characters, situations and dialogue were very real and believable. However, there was always an underlying of feeling sadness and dysfunction that I found to be too much of a downer to make me run out and tell all my book-loving friends to grab this and read. I wanted it to be a bit more charming/sweet to balance the depressing parts."
2,Where is the plot???,"""The Center of Everything"", although being well-written, had no plot, no climax, and very little drama. It was like reading someone's journal. I kept reading along wondering when something was going to happen, and it never did."
3,"good, but not great","I liked this book, but I did not love this book. It came highly recommended to me, and I can see why many would like it. The writing is excellent, and the author knows her subject well. The characters are people I have known growing up in the South, with all their trials and tribulations. However, I read for escape and this book is not about escape. It was depressing to me."
3,Not as good as I expected.,"This book was selected by my local book group. It was highly rated, so maybe my expectations were too high. The book follows the character through four or five years of her life, and although parts were interesting, I found myself skipping over other parts that were boring. The character ""speaks"" the same at the beginning of the book as she does at the end, meaning their is no growth in her speach pattern. There is some growth in the character, but I just didn't find her story all that compelling. It's not a terrible book, but I didn't think it was a great book."
2,Still looking for the point,"I understand that this is a book about Evelyn's challenges in life and how she handles them better than most, but at the end of the day I have to say that I just didn't see the point in the whole book. It left me feeling like ""wow, I really can't believe I just spent my time reading this."""
4,Descriptive prose and excellent writing.,"Laura Moriarty writes well. No effort made to dumb down, all subtlety intact and well drawn characters . A good read, not mesmerizing, not exciting but a story honestly told."
4,Center of everything,This book was good. I have been reading a lot of great books lately so it just seemed to pale in comparison.
5,A Must Read for Anyone Who's Breathing,"I bought this book in my airport gift shop, desperate to find a great summer read and fairly certain that the other books I'd chosen just wouldn't do. I visited some wonderful places on my trip, but one of the highlights was the time I spent with Evelyn Bucknow, lead character in this book. I was hooked from the very first line, and related to Evelyn in so many ways.Moriarty's writing is swift and poignant, and she touches on so many important themes, all told through the innocent eyes of Evelyn. What I especially liked about this book were the multidimensional characters. Some authors, first-timers especially, make the mistake of painting their characters in black or white--this one standing for this and that one standing for that--but Moriarty's brush is many-hued and vibrant.I look forward to reading subsequent novels by this author."
3,REVIEW OF THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING,I did not like the way this book ended. It was in the middle of a chapter. The book was good until the end.
3,Pretty depressing,Teenage pregnancy is a very depressing subject. Unfortunately it happens all too often. This book was written well although I felt this book ended too abruptly. I would have given our heroine a bit more happiness and gotten her out of that town before ending the book
4,Three Cheers Moriarty,"Looking for a real, humorous page-turner? Look no farther than Laura Moriarty's The Center of Everything, a novel that doesn't hide any aspects of poverty ridden lives. The protagonist, Evelyn, is a strong, opinionated, young girl trying to find where she fits in. She spends the majority of her adolescence on the outside, as many do, due to her poverty, family, and intense interests. When the book commences Evelyn is in elementary school and is being pulled into her young mother's crazy life, but throughout the book we see Evelyn grow into her own person, one that is unafraid to go against common belief. From religion to nuclear warfare, teen pregnancy to college application process this book has something for everyone. In between the involved plot, Moriarty weaves in imagery unique to many similar books. The variety of plots in this novel are at first overwhelming, but by the end are intriguing to the reader."
5,A fabulous read,"I read The Rest of Her Life first, Laura Moriarty's latest novel. It was so good that I wanted to read everything Moriarty's written. Unfortunately there was only one, The Center of Everything, but it's a fabulous one. Moriarty is a beautiful, elegant writer with well-drawn characters that you can relate to. Evelyn, the main character, is wonderfully funny and very real, someone you'd love to have in your life.The story grabbed me in the beginning and held me til the end. A fabulous read."
1,The Center of Everything,"I never ordered this book. It simply is not something that I would read. I am new to using a kindle, so I may have pushed the wrong button by mistake."
2,The Center of Everything,Interesting book - Would not definitely recommend it unless there was nothing else. Can't really remember what I was about as I read it a couple weeks ago.
2,I don't even know why I finished this book...,"I bought this book because it looked fun and it was free. It was absolutely awful. It's a story about a girl who lives with her single mother and is estranged from her relatives. The mother gets pregnant and has a disabled child which is talked about being cared for a lot. The girl loves a boy but the boy loves her best friend and then he gets her pregnant and marries her all while still in high school.There is no point to the story, no real plot. You follow the boring life of a teenager.I'd find something else to read, it was not enjoyable in the least and just as the title says, I have no idea why I even finished it."
4,The Center of Everything,"I very much enjoyed this book. It is a good indication of how someone that is born into poverty and faces many challenges is able to rise above it by the life choices she makes.I also had admiration for Tina, the mother. Her life choices were not good, but, she possessed a fierce love for her children.I especially admired the work she put in with her handicapped son.I would have given it five stars, but, the ending left me wanting more. Hopefully, a sequel will be written."
4,Great read!,Fast moving--hard to put down.One night I read until 5 am! I have 2 chapters to--can't wait to see how it ends!
4,Wish I would of read this sooner!,"""A great story."" I know it sounds bland, but this was a great story. In it's simplicity, the novel is about a girls life. Maybe not just a girls life but the life of girls ""growing up"" in general. The book deals with finding ones place, dealing with pressure from others, trying to fit in, pressure to try drugs, dealing with parents, and coping with life...even when you are struggling with all the other issues. I must say, I a glad I waited to read this, just because since this release the author has written other books! If you like coming of age books, I can't see why you wouldn't like this one."
4,Sad,"I am not all the way through this book but it is sad. It reminds me very much of the movie Monster Ball. It's about a single mom on low income, and how her daughter suffers because of the mom's bad choices. I think I read it a while ago, but the sequel ""The Rest of Her Life"" caught my eye as a new fiction novel, and thought it would be better to buy both books. The characters are very real, and the descriptions of landscape (highways, McDonalds, Qwik Stop) sound very much like a small town in Kansas!"
3,Reads like a frankly written autobiography.,"The realness of the characters grip you from the get go. You feel the awkward tensions, the secret longings and the teenage angst in a very palpable way which keeps those pages turning. Would have liked a more developed ending but all in all a good page turner."
4,The Center of Everything,"Excellent story of the struggles of a single parent and her daughter. Both have issues which are fairly common in today's society and both deal with them in their own way--the teenager shows more maturity than her mother, although the parent does eventually come to grips with her life and the effect her choices have had on her daughter."
3,Predictable,"While interesting, the story was a bit predictable and I found it to be depressing at times. Would appeal to teens."
2,Maybe if I had read to the end?,I only read about a third of this before putting it down. I just couldn't deal with the young protagonist's mother's poor choices. The reviews I had read spoke of the younger girl's overcoming the obstacles of her life; but I didn't have the stomach to wait until that happened. The writing was good; but the story depressing- at least up til the point I put it down.
2,on and on and on,"I kept trying to be engaged in this book and the characters. At 50% (Kindle version) I finally decided that I didn't care how it ends or where these people end up - too many books, too little time.sorry - I really wanted to like these characters - I did root for Evelyn - but not enough"
4,Entertaining little book,"This is simple story, but very entertaining. It was a kindle ""free"" download with Prime. I enjoyed the story, but would not have wanted to pay for it."
2,Coming of age story that falls flat,"This is a coming of age story about Evelyn, a young girl with a single mother. They live in Kansas and Evelyn is a lonely and bored young girl. The character development was interesting but the plot was not. I found it slow and very drawn out. It was the kind of book that I couldn't wait to finish and at the end it was a disapointment."
2,DEPRESSING,A I WAS VERY BORED. THE CHARACTERS WERE NOT ENDEARING AND IT JUST WENT ON AND ON WITH A BAD ENDING
2,The Center of Everything by Laura Moriarty,"I read a review of this book in a popular magazine, bought it, read it and was disappointed. I believe you can lump it in with all those 'rite of female passage' angst books. Although the author develops the characters in an acceptable style, I think she fails to have a meaningful plot. At the end of the book you're left thinking, WHY did I spend so much time waiting for something to happen??? Nothing ever happened."
3,Well written but depressing,"The book does a great job of developing characters and you eventually see a brighter future for some of them. I just find books about teen pregnancy, lack of education, poverty and religious fervor too depressing."
1,Not so great,"I kept waiting for the story to ho somewhere... No luck, no story, lame ending. Why is this on the best seller's list???"
4,The Center of everythig,I found this book to be a very enjoyable read and I really enjoyed how well the character came to life and was able to overcome her hardships and come to a better understanding about the center of everything.
4,Life in Kansas,This is the second book I've read by Moriarty. Great characterization. Makes you wonder what is going on at your neighbor's house. You would be surprised.
4,Promising debut novel by a promising author,"Whereas Dorothy wanted to get out of Kansas and landed up in Oz, Evelyn Bucknow thinks Kansas is at the center of everything. At age 10, the only problem in her otherwise perfect world is her mother's ineptitude and inability to hold her own life together, much less that of her impressionable daughter. This lovely story follows Evelyn on the teetery see-saw path between childhood and young adulthood with warmth, sincerity, and hope, deftly offering a cameo look at middle-class life smack dab in the middle of America."
1,Where is the rest of the book?,"I purchased this on my Kindle for a penny since the reviews were really high; however, I'm really disappointed that the book just abruptly ends without a conclusion. I liked the book and found it to be humorous, and well written up until it just abruptly ends. I guess the author is looking to do a series; however, I will not be purchasing the second book."
2,A Well-Written Story About Nothing,"I wanted to love this book. I really did. It flows nicely and I connected with the characters. I found myself really caring about what happened to them, and I even teared up a time or two. The problem? NOTHING ever happened to them. I kept reading and reading, thinking something big was about to drop, and then it was just more-- nothing. There were a couple times in which it seemed like something might be about to happen, but nope. It's just a story about any old girl from nowhere, USA, who doesn't quite fit in and doesn't know quite who she is; most of us lived that, so why would we want to read it? Plus I HATED the ending. I get that the story will be continued in future books, but I'm not interested enough to spend the time and money to read any more."
5,The Center of Everything,The Center of Everything is not your usual young adult novel. I was pleasantly surprised how inspiring Evelyn's story was. My heart did ache for her sometimes. Lately I've been reading a lot of YA books and most of them just mush together and i forget which was which but The Center of Everything really stands out and is very fresh.
5,Couldn't put it down/Didn't want it to end,"As a very busy mom of 3, my youngest having cerebral palsy & in a wheelchair, I do not get a chance to read for fun very much. And I am a person who loves to read. I read this novel in April 2010 on a 13 hour drive with hubby & the kids for spring break vacation, and for me personally...I could not put it down. I actually did not want this book to end & was very bummed out when it did. I lent my copy out a couple of months ago and wish I hadn't. I agree that it can be a little depressing, but I found the story and the characters, no matter how frustrating and infuriating some of them and their behaviors were, engaging and engrossing. I loved it. For me, it was entertaining. I wasn't looking for a story line filled with flowers, rainbows and unicorns. If I were, I wouldn't have read The Lovely Bones right after reading this one on that very same vacation. As a book club selection, I think this novel would generate interesting discussions."
3,so so....,"The center of everything is s mindful, inspiring, and a passionite book. I got it and started reading if and not the most apporiate for young children. Says the f word very often. Also swears alot. An okay book"
3,Book Review,"I liked the story and the book, just not the ending. I enjoyed the story and the years of adolescent growing pains."
2,THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING,"IT WAS A GOOD BOOK, BUT NOT ONE OF MY FAVORITES. SORRY. SOMETIMES AN AUTHOR WHO IS UNKNOWN TO ME IS EXCELLENT, AND SOMETIMES I'M LEFT WANTING."
3,Kind of forgetable,I am sitting here about a month after reading this book trying to write reviews on everything I have read this month. And I find myself remembering very little about this book. If I really press myself I can remember Evelyn as a younger girl and her not fitting in at school. I remember her befriended the boy that lived in her apartment complex and later the girl that moved in. I also remember that her mother was erratic and her grandmother was a fanatic. Her grandfather didn't have anything to do with the family and that her little brother has autism and he is her mother's main focus throughout most of the book. I guess since it is so forgettable that it must have not been that great. Really I am wracking my brain to try to write a little about it. I know it wasn't completely terrible or I would be able to write a really good and mean review. I am pretty sure I got it for free and will possibly read it again or at least skim it.
5,Simply the best,"I bought 3 of these recently. One each for my two kids, and another one for me. My original has swollen from spilling (mostly butter) all over it, the spine is broken, and sections of the book are falling out. But that is what book that are used a lot look like. My kids grew up on Gumbo, etouffee, sticky chicken... there is nothing in this book that isn't wonderful. Every Thanksgiving we have Corn Maque choux, Oyster dressing, and yams from this book. Nothing is bad, except what it will do for your waist!"
5,Paul Prudhommes Lousianna Kitchen,Great book! It is hard to find and no longer in print and I got it on Amazon for a super steal!
5,eat this?,want to die young and have every disease known to man?just eat what is in this book every day and by the time you are 50 you will so ill food wont matter anymore.
5,Chef Paul be the baddest of the bad!!!,"This is a wonderful Louisiana cookbook. I even read the *intro*! Many other ""cajun"" or Acadian cookbooks are very stingy with their secrets. Not Chef P! All is revealed; my Crawfish Ettouffe' was nearly identical to that I had in New Orleans. Bravo and thank you, Chef Paul!!!!"
4,My Husbands Hero,"My husband and I love to cook...however my husbands hero is Paul Prudhomme. Down loaded this cookbook to my Kindle Fire I received for Christmas. We were trying to re-call a certain recipe favorite and since we do not carry our cookbooks with us when we travel we were not able to find the recipe, now we have a copy on the Kindle and can look up all recipes in this book."
5,A dynamic CD!,"This album is the premier authentic collection of music inspired by and based upon the ideals, stories and history of Kwanzaa. In addition to a wide range of instrumental pieces, the album features eight specifically chosen vocal performances, ranging from traditional African songs to contemporary composed pieces. A standout for me is ""Mya Si Grei"", a traditional song which originated in Guyana, sung by enslaved Africans and passed down to their children. The lyrics roughly translate into ""Even though we are here in these terrible conditoins, we are still the same proud, noble people we always were."" I also enjoyed Jody Gray's a capella arrangement of ""Lift Every Voice"" performed with the Free Voices of Praise Choir. This is a dynamic, beautiful CD, one I highly recommend to celebrate Black History any time of year."
1,It taught me nothing!,I am very disappointed after I read this book. This book taught me nothing on horse handicapping.This book actually teaches the reader how to use a horse handicapping software.
1,A Sorry Purchase,I'm sorry I every bought this one. This will be the last time I purchase a book that hasn't been reviewed.
2,Not accurate,"The pump was complete and easy to install, but the gauge reads almost full not full, and almost empty, stranding me, not empty. Not cool."
4,never die...,"well, to be honest i don't like psychobilly, but i did like this album a lot, i actually just listened to it again...i only wish they would have stuck to the more country side, like the track outlaw heart, man that song really blows me away...they are pretty good live too"
2,Very Amateur,"This is not a great Psychobilly album. Especially since in later albums the bassist is a different person (seeing that on this album the bassist is from The Quakes, which is a much better band) some songs are good like Noctournal, Outlaw Heart, Trance and Twenty Flight Rock. But if you want real Psychobilly, listen to Nekromantix, Guana Batz, Blazing Haley, The Meteors (which are the original Psychobilly band), and The Quakes. The guitar on their second album is very poor, with simplistic riffs, and far too catchy tunes. Hopefully they release a good album soon."
2,Tiger army cd,"Upon recieving the cd I found that the plastic cd holder was broken and that someones initals are written on the cd. This was not mentioned in the discription, it was stated that the cd was in good condition and the cd is scratched up. Im really not happy with the condition of the item."
4,Tiger Army never die!,"This is their first album. A.F.I. drummer Adam Carson and Quakes stand-up bassist Rob Peltier are playing beside Nick 13 on this record.Almost every song on this album is great. But I like ""True Romance"", ""Devil Girl"", ""Never Die"" and ""Outlaw Heart"" (which is uses a pedal steel guitar) the most. And a great cover of Eddie Cochran's ""Twenty Flight Rock"" is here too.Dark rockabilly, psychobilly record is a must buy for everyone."
5,It's Great,"I've been looking for this album for some time now and now that I have it I'm not disapointed in the least bit. The music is great the lyrics are dark and well written and the country song on here is perfect. The lead singer Nick 13's voice fits in very well with the music. This was worth digging for it's one of the coolest albums I've heard in a while, if only it was longer. But buy this album it's worth it."
1,This is so.... mediocre,"Another promising album of famous oldies hits the skids.THIS IS SOUL consists of inferior remakes, including a crowd noise-laden live version of ""Papa's Got A Brand New Bag."" This isn't soul, it's imitation soul, and as everyone knows, musically ""Imitation is the severest form of flat 'n' off key."" Beware!"
5,Superb,"Dr. Morgan has really done a splendid job. I can't think of a more illuminating or learned text on the Georgics. Morgan's style, wit, and command of detail never fail to impress. A first class effort!"
3,This is just what I wanted,"I am very happy with this chair, I especially like the blue cover on the seat that isnt so cold when I sit on it. I have had ankle surgery and this has been much better than my husband having to raise and lower me into the bathtub to bathe. I also am able to bathe myself whith this chair which I was not able to do with the past surgerys I have had on my ankle."
3,NOT A BAD BOOK,"I have had my fair share of speeding tickets. With the help of this book and my favorite, the Educated Guide To Speeding Tickets by Richard Wallace, I beat almost every ticket in court. Both books help prepare you for court. The Educated Guide even has a chapter on how to avoid getting stopped and ticketed in the first place. Also, the author Mr. Wallace is a former cop and he even returned my phone call to him, imagine that! These insider information books really help people fight back at a greedy system designed JUST to make money for the governments.Thanks amazon.com for carrying such great books!"
5,super page-turner,"Sara's Song is one of those curl in your chair and read, read, read. Loved this book. Love the name Sara. Everything was in your face. I could relate. Passed this on to six diffeent people. All six feel the same way.jane lapufsky"
5,Too great for words.,"Sarah's Song is absolutely one of the best books I have ever read. It was really hard to pick a favorite character, they were all so great. Did not want this book to end, unfortunately it did way to quickly. Recommend it to everyone!"
3,Definitely Not the Best I've Read,"First time reading this author. I thought I was the only one who noticed all of the typos in the book but after reading reviews here, I can see I wasn't. There were enough typos in this book to throw off the reader. I enjoyed the first part of the book, finding the plot unusual and interesting. However, the characters soon started saying and doing stupid things in the middle of the book and that was IT for me. I had to skim through it to find out which guy she ended up with but didn't waste my time with the rest of the book."
1,My first book by her,"I just couldn't get into her writing style. For some reason, her sentence style just seemed choppy, not detailed enough, and hard to get into for me. A lot of my friends love her, but I just couldn't get into this book."
1,A waste of time. Poorly developed characters.,"This was my first (and last) Fern Michaels book. The characters never seem to have any kind of relationship at all and the only interesting person in the book was Nellie. Also, the ending was terrible. I thought she went with the wrong brother."
4,Sara's Song,Sara's Song was an unusual and very entertaining love story. It was very well written and I would definitely recommend this book to friends.
5,This is one of the author's best!,"I read all Fern Michaels books I can get my hands on. This was one of the really, really good ones.I know some people like these characters. I guess that's what makes them and the story line so real. You feel like you know the characters and are living the story. A very good read and the author didn't disappoint me."
1,Yuck!,"Somehow I finished this book--sort of. I did skim a lot of pages along the way. And someone had told me it was good!The doctor and Dallas only seemed to be good friends yet they agree to marry after only knowing each other for a few weeks. He dies and then she meets the brother. She distrusts him, overcomes that, looks forward to a date with him and then cries over Dallas. It didn't work for me. Then things get resolved, a YEAR passes and just like that, things are better than before. Dallas and Jack seemed TOO different from each other to be believed.Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,No stars would be given if I had the option,"I talked with my sister one day and we discuss books frequently. She said she was reading the most badly written book ever. Well, after I started reading a batch of books she lent to me months later...I picked it right out! This is the second book by this author I have tried to plod through, and only because I was hard-up for something to read. I got bored reading her one-sided page long dialogues. NOBODY talks and talks like that. I think this may just be Michaels style of writing..one I will make a point to avoid in the future. I'll stick to Nora Roberts and Elizabeth Lowell for characters that have depth and dialogues that are pertinent to the story-line."
1,One for the recycle bin,I could not believe that this book was published. The dialogue was stilted at best and moronic at worst. The characters were not believable and the only reason I finished the book was to see how bad the ending could possibly be - it didn't disappoint. Perhaps I was searching for a book that offered better characters and far better dialogue - I guess I'll just stick to Nora Roberts or Jayne Ann Krentz or Judith Naught.
1,The worst instant coffee...,"For $700 I could have bought all the MacDonald's coffee I want, yet I went with this swill. Gross to the last drop."
1,It is not equipped to be secured at the back of a car seat.,"It is not equipped to be secured at the back of a car seat. It is a well-made hand/shoulder carry case for a dvd player or similar device and thats all about it. If it had D-rings and straps to go with it, I would have kept it."
5,dvd player carrier,"It is fine, sturdy, worth the price. It fits my player which is larger than normal..."
4,Great case if price is not an issue,"This is a nice case that should work for most people. It is well-padded to provide excellent protection of your DVD player. There is also an internal strap that will go over the player (between the screen & base unit) to keep it secured inside the case. That is a nice touch. In addition to the dedicated DVD sleeves, there is room to store cables & other small peripherals. I'd give this 5 stars if the price were not so high. You can purchase a much larger notebook computer case from Targus for less than this. But if you're looking for something designed to carry & protect your portable DVD player, this will fit the bill for most folks."
4,Great And Useful,"All though the object does not work as the person it was bought for entirely, it does how ever function as a whole. The person who it was bought for was upset that the object did not come with a place to store a power plug or a number of other things but as a whole I would have to say that the sports case has functioned above expectations besides that."
3,Doesn't work with the Toshiba SD-P101S 10-Inch Portable DVD Player,"This case is recommended by Amazon with the Toshiba SD-P101S 10-Inch Portable DVD Player. The DVD player DOES NOT fit into the case with the battery connected to the player. The case itself is nice, I wish they had a similar case but larger."
4,targus sport portable case dvd301-10 black with gray,"no thanks,its enough that thing i ordered,i will search for another product from you.if it's need it.no need to link my order for your other product as of this time. thank for your product"
2,The Sport case is NOT for cars,"It is just a case. It's hard to figure that out since the reviews on here are all mixed up. I ordered based on the reviews I read only to find out it would only carry it, not attach to the seat for viewers in the back."
1,This item recommended with the player and it doesn't fit,"Warning, this case claims to hold 9"" DVD players, but I purchased the Toshiba SD P2500, which has an 8.9"" viewing screen, AND this case was the only case recommended with this item, but it does not fit! If you have a large DVD player, don't buy this. You'll just have to pay the shipping costs to send it back. It infuriated me that Amazon would recommend an incompatible product."
4,Very nice case,"Well designed case for portable DVD player. Has a nice velcro insert that allows you to adjust the fitting for your particular player. Very well padded and comfortable to carry. Has sleeves to carry, IIRC, 24 discs. Strongly recommended."
1,Targus Sport Portable DVD player case,"Does NOT hold a 9"" screen portable DVD player as advertised. I bought this case for my Toshiba SD-P2500 Portable DVD Player with an 8.9"" screen and it's too large to fit in this case."
4,Great Case,The perfect case for the DVD player I bought. Hopefully my granddaughter will keep her new player protected in it.
5,Excelent product!,"Este bolso es de excelente calidad, lo compre para un portatil Asus, y cabe perfectamente bien, buenos materiales, buena proteccion para el equipo.This product has a excelent quality, I bought for a Asus laptop, and it fit perfectly, good material, and offer a good protection for the equipment"
5,Does the job!,"I bought this case for my 5-year-old nephew after I purchased a Sony DVD player for him for Christmas last year. He likes to take the DVD player with him pretty much wherever he goes, so the case is indispensable. My sister reports that the DVD player (Sony DVP-FX820 8-Inch) fits well, and there are no problems with the case."
4,Great UMPC bag,"I bought this bag for my EeePC 1000H 10"" laptop. Although the laptop has much more room than it needs on all sides, there are velcro straps to keep it in place. There is easily enough space in the same main compartment for 8.5 x 11 business papers. I bought this case size in hope that about an inch thick of standard paper size could fit, and it does. The DVD storage area and its pockets provide an organized area for pens, business cards, papers and other items. Front flap pocket has side zippers for side access that I haven't had a need for yet but it could make it easier for access in tight spots. This section is more than enough room for my AC charger and flash sticks, cell charger, etc. Allows plenty of room for my feet when stowed under an airline seat. Good quality workmanship with little bling. Would have been nice to have a detachable shoulder strap, but not much of an issue."
5,KINDLE users--this is PERFECT !!,"I had purchased this 3 years ago for my 9 inch DVD Player, which I really don't use as much anymore and was looking for a cheaper alternative to carrying my kindle to work every day and started looking at Dvd cases when I realized I already had one! If you're looking for a PERFECT fit for your kindle plus your adapter and even A Mighty Bright Light--THIS IS IT! Its lightweight, great to carry your kindle on bus or metro! And much cheaper than some of the Kindle bags. (we also have a couple Case Logic cases too...so many cheaper alternatives to toting your Kindles!)"
4,Good case for bulky DVD players,Our DVD is a bit chunky and didn't fit in some other cases we tried. It fits very well in this case. This one doesn't have a system for hanging the case between two seats in the car. That is it's most significant drawback. Another minor issue is the power supply and cables barely fit in the pockets but this would probably be an issue for any case. The front pocket of the case has sleeves for up to 10 DVDs which is a nice feature.
4,A Good Case,This case is well-padded and provides great protection for the DVD player. It also can hold all the connections and a couple of DVDs. It's not heavy either.
2,Not fond of this bag,I didn't care for this particular bag. It's pretty cheap looking and feeling. I had bought two cases for my parents Portable DVD players that are much better. Go for the Case Logic. VERY nice case.
4,good quality and fit,"Nice little case and fits my Sony 9 inch portable well, with room for all the components. Well satisfied."
4,Nice case but too big for me!,"This is a great looking case, although my five inch Panason LS5 rolls around in the thing...much too big."
4,Quality Case...a bit small to hold all!,"I purchased this case along with the Coby DVD 8500 portable player...the player fits nicely...but after filling the accessory holder with the AC adapter, earphones and remote there is scant room for DVD's...better get a separate holder for your discs!!"
2,"Cheesy Chill, Don't believe the other reviews! Bad elevator music...","As an avid Chill and Lounge music collector, I can esily say this is one of the cheesiest, corniest lounge music ever made. I just got done reviewing Elemental Chill: AIR and gave it 5/5 Stars. I'm advising you to look else where, this disc is a coaster with only a couple mediocre songs. You want bad elevator music? Buy this CD!"
5,To tell the Truth,"The key word in the book's title is ""Truth."" The forthrightness of Lori's message is very refreshing. I feel as though I have been held accountable for my past poor attitudes regarding singleness and it's spirit-renewing! Even if you are a single (or you know a single person) who isn't struggling with the single status at this moment, this book is a must-read especially for the perspectives on being content."
3,These are strange blues,"a blues based band locked into some progressive rock nuances. i am not a big blues fan, so i can't give this band all the praise that they may deserve. but this is pretty good collection of songs. ""Valentyne Suite"" would be the starting place for this band. Colosseum is for those who like a bit of unusual spice added to their blues plate. if that is your thing, then buy these Colosseum records and dig deep. enjoy!"
1,Weight Training Advanced & Intermediate,"I purchased the Weight Training Intermediate/Advanced DVDs featuring Charles Glass. Unfortunately, the DVDs are defective and will not play properly. I'm unsure whether this is an isolated problem but I did purchase **TWO** DVDs with the same defect."
3,Disappointing,"Vine's novels usually leave me breathless with admiration, but I found this positively tame compared to most of her earlier work. The basis of the plot (biographical research uncovering a mystery) is intriguing, and as usual the characters are fascinating enough (though not overly so this time), but the story develops slowly, and above all clumsily, the nature of the final revelation being a far cry from most of her flawless closing downs. The ending came as no huge surprise to me either, which is most unusual for Vine, being a mistress of skillful deception. There are a few nice touches though, particularly 'the game'. Worth reading if primarily for the marvellous literary style and narrative on display."
5,One of the best books I`ve ever read,"It really is, it's not like any ordinary ""crime""book, but still very thrilling. I can only agree with Minette Walters: ""unputdownable"". It feels like you know how it's going to end from the beginning, but that doesn't matter, not for me anyway. I wanted to go on reading and reading and I actually felt sad when the book was finished."
4,Great sense of location,"I liked the book a lot, and agree with many other reader comments: plot a little predictable, but a great ride along the way. I spend a lot of time in the area in which the book is set & think that Vine has done an excellent job in depicting the scenery & atmosphere. Her descriptions of the sea mist are particularly evocative - and I know because I've camped nearby many times.It may interest readers from outside the UK to know that most of the locations mentioned are real - Ilfracombe, Barnstaple etc. The main place, Graunton, is fictional but very similar to Saunton Sands combined, perhaps, with Braunton Burrows. The actual hotel there is the ""Saunton Sands Hotel"" and is a huge art deco edifice, in a similar clifftop position. In the novel ""The Dunes"" is architecturally much more like the neo-edwardian ""Woolacombe Bay Hotel"" a few miles down the coast."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"To put it bluntly, this is a mystery without mystery, a thriller without thrills. Like ""Anna's Book"" and ""No Night Is Too Long"" it is populated by obnoxious and predictable people. Two thirds of the way through you have everything figured out and there are no surprises left. The typical Barbara Vine twist at the end that shocks, surprises, and delights is totally lacking here. What I find most dismaying is that a writer of Vine's stature has sunk to using gimmicks to spice up an otherwise pedestrian plot. I hope she waits until she can come up with some decent characters and a plot that that has more to offer than tabloid sensationalism before publishing another book."
4,One of the best by Barbara Vine.,"I'm a big fan of Barbara Vine's psychological novels. The quality of these books can vary widely, (Gallowglass and King Solomon's Carpet are especially weak), but when they're good, they're great. The Chimmney Sweeper's Boy belongs firmly in the second camp."
2,Readable but relatively uninteresting,"Vine's characters are almost all unlikeable and their problems are delivered in a way that's ridiculously obvious. This prevents any depth -- and thus any sympathy. More importantly, the ""mystery"" of the book is not only anticlimactic but absurd. If anything led up to it, I would be more forgiving. But it seems as if Vine needed a neat way to wrap it up and used the first thing that popped into her head."
3,Long and dark novel,"This is lenghty and dark novel based on forged identity and the fragile lives built upon it. When Gerald, a successful and lauded author dies, his daughter is left with unraveling the mystery of his and his family's life. While the characters are well developed, they are intense, selfish and flawed. Ruth Rendell writing as Barbara Vine manages to draw the reader in, but one can't help feeling that none of the people in the story were worth getting to know."
4,More than a mystery,"I have a very high opinion of Rendell/Vine and enjoyed every single book I read. This one was one of the best with fully developed characters, a strong story and the spicy unexpected turns.What distinguishes this author's mysteries from the rest out there is a depth in exploring what motivates people's behavior and acts, no matter whether these are acts of love and loyalty or hatered and shalowness."
3,"Not one of Vine's best, but...","I agree with other readers: in this book the great mystery is in fact no big mystery, and I should say that the way in which some situations (like the ""Adam"" situation) are solved is rather unsatisfactory, but the psychological development of her characters is as interesting as ever, and the book is absorbing enough, though certainly not on a par with, for example, A Dark Adapted Eye or A Fatal Inversion."
3,"Good, but by no means brilliant","This was the first Barbara Vine novel I read and after reading the reviews I felt I should add my own. The story is well paced and well told, which is what one would expect of such a successful author. However it lacks speed, ingenuity and real mystery. The plot is painfully guessable and one is left feeling let down and cheated at the end. The characters and the texture are rich and this is what saves an otherwise predictable story. Before I read it, I was really looking foward to it but I don't think I will read another Barbara Vine novel. It lacks true punch."
2,"Very ""skimmable"" and MUCH too long to reach the ""revelation""","I LOVE Ruth Rendell--but maybe not so much Barbara Vine.This book simply seemed TOO LONG--it starts out interestingly enough but there are so many blind alleys as the daughter begins to investigate who (or what) her father was.And the final ""revelation""--revealed in the last 5 pages--is disappointing because it simple seems to take forever to be reached, and we're left wondering why we have spent so many pages with all those other characters who added nothing, simply passing the time/pages."
5,Extremely well-written novel by one of my favorite authors,"I'm a big fan of Ruth Rendell/ Barbara Vine. Thats why I had high expectations for The Chimney Sweeper's boy when I picked it up last week. This book, for the most part, did not disappoint. Running in the same detective/ horror/ I-don't know-how to describe it vein as the Blood Doctor and others, this book follows the life of the acclaimed author Gerald Candless- after his death. His daughter Sarah is given the task of writing a memoir on the life of her famous father- and in the process runs into a few closet skeletons, so to speak.This is a perfectly-written novel; its a shame that the author isn't quite as well known in the US as she is in other parts of the world."
2,Her heart wasn't in it,"I am also a big fan of Barbara Vine. I loved both A Dark-Adapted Eye and A Fatal Inversion. I almost didn't finish this one, but ploughed through only out of a sense of loyalty to the author. There is a description of one of Gerald Candless' novels, something to the effect of ""his heart wasn't in it, or maybe the heat got to him."" I feel that way about The Chimney Sweeper's Boy. None of the characters really came alive for me and, as others have said, the plot was predictable. The only thing I really found intriguing was the relationship between Sarah and Adam. I hope that others will give Vine's other books a try - there's so much more that she's capable of."
2,A disappointment-,"I've been an ardent fan of Barbara Vine (Ruth Rendell) for years now, and this is the first of her books that I've been disappointed in. The ending you could see coming a mile away. I felt like the whole book was an exercise in pushing a liberal agenda on sexual mores rather than a good mystery-mainly because there was no mystery-it was all quite clear what the outcome was to be, and I'm usually not good at seeing the end coming! It is the last of her books I will read. I think she's run out of ideas."
1,"Yuck, three unhappy women and one sick man","Mistery, yes well, what mystery? You can read in the first pages that Gerald Candless wants kids but cannot imagine conception with a woman. That is a good hint at what is bothering the man.What really turned me off was the fate of the Candless women. All unhappy because of their husband/father. Not only unhappy but trapped. Ursula, the best of her years wasted on a loveless marriage. The girls, so hung up on their father they are unable to form relationships of their own. Hope has a boyfriend but does not seem half as involved with him as with her (dead) fahter. How awful. What a macho story. The author never lets one the three female charcters doubt their place and role in that family. There is no inkling of braking away for their own good. It's almost hard to believe a woman sat down to write a story of such trapped female souls. No more books from Barbara Vine for me, thank you."
1,Expired Battery on Arrival!,It's nice that it ships with batteries. But the one we got had one battery already leaking corrosive stuff out of it. This does not inspire confidence....
5,safety,First Alert carbon monoxide detector is worth the investment. It is easy to set up and brings peace of mindcarbon monoxide detector
1,BEWARE First Alert CO400 - Does Not Work,"I bought this CO detector, installed batters, and the test button successfully sounded the alarm. Held the unit in a burning fireplace, silence. Held it under burning paper, silence. Held it for one minute, one inch from the tailpipe of my running car, silence. Consider the Kidde CO detector instead.UPDATE: Now I read that CO detectors cannot be tested, as I tried to do above. You just buy them, and hope they work, and if they do not, you ... die? How does the Consumer Product Safety Commission EARN their money?"
2,CO detector review,The product arrived promptly and was as advertised. I am very satisfied with my purchase. I ccAn recommend this item to anyone
1,Read the fine print,"I purchased this device to measure carbon monoxide on my sailboat. Nowhere in the description of the product does it state that it is not suitable for marine use. Upon receipt, the instructions specify that it is not for marine use. In addition, I wanted to know if it actually responded to carbon monoxide, so I intended to put it in the garage with my car running. Whoops, you cannot do that either. It has a notice that says that if you try testing the device as I intended, it will void the warranty.Now, do you think I should use this in my boat to protect my family?Probably not."
1,"cheap plastic, battery door does not close","I ordered 2 sets of 4 each for my rental properties. Five of the alarms were not usable. The door to the battery compartment did not close. When I tried to force one, it broke. These are cheap, useless alarms. Move up to an alarm that actually works."
3,"OK, lousy mount","CA law now says you have to install these things. I think they are a waste of money for a modern home/apartment with a modern furnace in CA. But the law is the law and this model is the cheapest of the bunch. It seems to work OK. But installation is a little weird. Unlike smoke alarms, you have to use a template to drill the mounting holes. But there is no template in the packaging (I couldn't find one and I bought five of these for some apartments), so you have to make your own. Then once you're done, the unit is supposed to snap into the screw mounts. It doesn't. It's not designed to be flat against the wall and just kinds of hangs there at a slight angle. The mount is secure, but the end result visually is kind of dopey."
1,Cheap junk -- your family's safety is worth more.,"I bought this along with the more expensiveFirst Alert CO410model to replace two Kidde-brand models which had died within two years of purchase. I figured a different brand had to be better, right?No.I put in fresh batteries, and this one started making a squealing noise, somewhere between a proper alarm and a sick baby. Something was clearly not right, and no amount of pushing buttons or changing batteries would help.The other more expensive model was no better -- its fancy LCD panel displayed random meaningless lines rather than letters or numbers (similar to the way the Kidde models had failed, in fact), and similarly refused to be reset to a sane state.I don't know about you, but that's all the chances I'm willing to give First Alert. If the two I got were so broken out of the box, how can I possibly trust any replacement?So I don't know what I'm going to get, but it won't be from either First Alert or Kidde."
3,Protection that is not the easiest to understand,Understanding the alarm requires counting and interpreting the number of chirps to know what is causing the alarm - too complicated and requires finding where I put the instruction booklet. The Red Power/Alarm light is dificult to see if the alarm is mounted above eye level.
1,First Alert Monoxide Alarm,"I ordered two Alarm's when I went to test them one broke and would not work after that.I called the company they told me to send it back to Amazon said I pushed to hard when I checked it,more trouble then it is worth to send back, would not order again."
2,goes off every 3 months and needs reset,"These kind of things are hard to review, since chances are you won't ever have it go off.Mine goes off nearly exactly every 3 months, and I need to remove and replace the battery. I think it's something with the sensor gradually 'filling up' with the low level of monoxide."
3,Find a place to place the detector before you buy it!,"You can trust the ""First Alert"" products. Just be certain that you can place the detector in a location that will allow the detector to work properly before you decide to order yours."
3,Great,"It fits nice and well on my wall. Unfortunately, this is battery operated. I wish it was able to be plugged in to an outlet."
3,First Alert,"I thought I was getting a new product for a good price. I guess it's true, you get what you pay for. The Carbon Monoxide Alarm was' unused but not 'new'. The battery that came with it expired in 2007 so the warranty on the alarm is no longer valid.It seems to work ok but I purchased a new battery to install in it and after paying for shipping I would've been better off paying full price at the local hardware store."
3,Flimsy Interlock - Worse Instructions,"I hope to not find out if these actually work. With luck we will never be faced with high levels of CO in our house.I purchased 6 of these so that I could have devices scattered around the house. The price was right and the manufacturers name known.Upon arrival I opened one to take a look. Opening the battery door revealed a thin plastic latching mechanism that fits into a slot over the battery compartment. When I closed the door the part just snapped off.Upon further examination it appears that had the batteries been in place the latch would have functioned properly - and it did on subsequent units. Unfortunately the IFU does not include guidance on this ""feature"".That particular unit is sitting on top of a book case in my living room. The battery door seems to stay closed so no harm, no foul."
5,Awesome,Easy Set-up. Hopefully never having to hear this alarm go off! Great to put on any wall or ceiling! Make sure to keep your family safe and sound with one of these alarms on each floor!
5,Great buy for the money,Great value here highly recommended. Safety given by this device knowing you are protected is invaluable. Go and buy it. You won't be sorry
1,sucked - threw it away,"once put on the wall, tested accurately only intermittently ... wasnt worth anything ... so the decison was made to throw it away"
5,"good price, easy setup","the price was good, I just put in the batteries, tried the self test, all was good, put it on the all, and done"
4,First Alert CO400 - Sent to family because I CARE,"My daughter lives in NY and the building has an old basement furnace that heats the two flats above it. When it failed they had no heat, but someone told me the Carbon Monoxide may seep out through cracks in the interior chimney wall.I purchased 3 and sent one to her, one to Dad (who uses a wood stove) and kept one for my future home. Required in all apartments & rental homes, so get one for your OWN safety!!!"
4,So far so good,"I bought this 3-pack package and it arrived pretty fast. It's easy to use but I don't have any other feedback other than its look, outside quality, easy of use and price. Hopefully I would never use it. =D"
3,Could be better,"As previously mentioned, the instructions say that this alarm cannot be mounted within 20 feet of our furnace. Our furnace is in the hall, where the bedroom doors are. The packaging recommends a CO alarm in the garage, but you can't use this one according to the instructions. Last, the battery door does not close securely. Installation was fairly simple, and it tests ok so far, but any problems this one goes out."
3,Very poor installation instructions,"Battery installaion is not very clear.If you open the door and try to close it without installing the batteries, you wiil break off the plastic tab on the inside of the battery door.I contacted the manufacturer, and suggested that on futore manufacturing of this product that a label be placed as a warning to prevent damage to the unit.I would apprciate it Amazon could replace the unit that I have."
2,First Alert C0400,"The item arrived defective. After examing the rattling noise, I found out that the battery door locking mechanism is broken. I believe the item is poorly manufactured."
5,FAST COOKER,"IT IS THE BEST COOKER, IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS, BREAK, LUNCH DINNERS, EASY DIRECTIONS, BAKES CAKES, STEAMS VEGES. MEALS ARE TASTY, IT HELPED US IMPROVE OUR COOKING, MAKE DINNERS IN AS LITTLE AS 20 MINUTES (FULL DINERS) WE WILL RETURN AND PURCHASE SEVERAL MORE AS GIFTS. A HEALTHY WAY OF COOKING, IT IS WORTH THE MONEY, THIS IS A HIT. THK YOU MRS M. COLOMBO AND FAMILY"
3,Plant Stakes,"Bought to hold rope lights for a wedding. The stakes were not strong enough, but I'm sure I'll find use for them for something else."
4,4 editions!,"Note: There are at least 4 different printings of Peters' book ""The Children of Abraham"" sometimes with the subtitle ""Judaism, Christianity, and Islam"". (May 1982):hb, 240pgs, ISBN:0691072671; (Jan 1984):pb, ISBN:9990824762; (Jan 1990):pb, 225pgs, ISBN:0691020302; (Aug 2004 revised):hb, 312pgs; ISBN:0691120412."
3,Academic Review,"This book is actually a little dissappointing for the background of the author, but she approaches it from a general academic point of view, very general and almost dry. She covers the Jews, Christian and Muslim point of history but in a more modern way. She doesn't really cover Abraham's history deeply as well with these three religons as her communication is more from a more academic, discussion type of approach. This is compared to some other books I have looked at that apply and guide one from Abraham's story to how their individual religon applies to it. F.E Peter never really gets that detailed it's more of a top of the water type of approach. If you want more of an opinion or article like discussion of this history, then this is what I believe this is."
1,Failed to do Research,"There are many errors in this book. The most outstanding is the author's description of the vampire bat as having a beak. He refers to the bat's beak many times. Since a bat is a mammal and has a nose and a mouth with teeth, I think it is evidence of the thinness of Mr. Kurtinski's research. The story is as predictable as the last reviewer states. There is a lot of needless violence with particular focus on rape. The book lacks depth of story and character. There are much better books about vampires than this one. Mr. Kurtinski should not write a sequel."
4,"B-movie fun meets ""Most Dangerous Game""","This is a definitive ""B"" movie, but it is great fun to watch. Two slave girls escape from a slave spaceship only to crash land on a remote planet who's sole permenant inhabitant is a reclusive nobleman. He always has ""Guests"" because the planet is in a ""Sargasso Sea"" of space. The problem is, the guests keep disappearing. The girls soon catch on to his hunting preference and fight back. Lots of T&A, but nowhere near porn by todays standards. Fun special effects."
4,"Great Movie, Fun to watch.","This movie is the retelling of the suspenseful tale ""The Most Dangerous Game"" with a futuristic Sci-Fi setting. Given the low budget it was made with, it is amazing what level of quality was acheived. The movie has quite a number of settings: spaceship interiors, the villian's mansion, ruins, jungles, a beach, and others. Hence, the movie does not seem claustrophobic.The acting I found more than adequate. The heroines were not scripted to be bimbos, and have mostly meaningful conversations.Most low budget Sci-Fi films are dark. This one is actually upbeat, which I found refreshing."
2,*YAWN*,"Two slave girls escape slavers to end up on a planet where they end up becoming the prey for a insane hunter. As somebody pointed out already, in one of the other reviews, it is silly. The females are cute, above advantage pretty, but not that impressive even when topless. The sci-fi parts of the story, such as the robots, space ships and zombies, are cool for a 1980's film (if it had been made for TV). I don't know what they were trying to make. The story is OK but nothing to dish out money for. The girls are good looking, as I have already pointed out, but they barely do anything to give the film a R rating. A mixture of many things.It's nice but don't ask for too much. Get it used."
5,Yummy slave girls,There were few nude scenes but they was GOOD! The beach scene is WOW!Sure it's obvious why i bought the movie but it's overall entertainment value is pretty good.
3,PUBERTY ROCK!,Guys who are hitting PUBERTY will love this movie!I watched it several times..and it does have monsters and half naked women and crazy stuff like that!
1,Ummm... Where is this thing???,I ordered this 7 weeks ago and still havent gotten it I would really like to get it before 2007!!
4,The Hills Are Alive With The Sound Of Noise,"I own this album and really like it,but don't buy it expecting to listen to music or you will be sorely disappointed. I would highly recommend listening to ""Might"" or ""God & Beast"" to help assimilate to NON before buying ""Blood & Flame"". If you are familiar with NON then you already know what to expect. The best way to describe this album is a continuous drone of ""orchestrated noise"". So turn off the boob tube, block out all other distractions, relax and let the sounds take you to another demension of time and space."
1,Butchered songs,"If you buy this CD for Switch's ""I Call Your Name"", they have totally butchered this song. It brought tears to my eyes the way that they have cut this song up. They took a 7 minute and 35 second song and brought it down to 3 minutes and 57 seconds!! WHY?!? They also shortened ""They'll Never Be"". Totally Disappointed!!!"
5,Brilliant,"If you like Tenacious D, if you like Spinal Tap, if you like Ween, if you like good, funny music, then this is the best band ever. Otherwise, they are still pretty damn good. Enjoy."
5,Great memories,"I was actually at this gig and I have to say, of the many gigs I have been to (several hundred) - this was one of the strangest....and best.It was recorded at a recording studio in some dark recess in the the Brighton/ Brookline area in Boston (god knows where). An audience was invited along to view the great Upper Crust perform live (with free beer too!). We stood there only to see the band walk right past us and into the recording booth. We then proceeded to watch the band via a video link that was broadcasting from within the studio onto an adjoining wall. So we never actually saw the band play 'live'...we were watching a live broadcast even though the band were about 10 feet from where we were standing. Very strange and all these years later it still makes me smile. An excellent gig and an excellent band. One of Bostons' best...despite the silly clothes."
5,This Dude Can Flat Out Play!!!!!!,I heard Mike Phillips live like a week before the CD came out in L.A. and he had the whole crowd on there feet. He did a 16 bar rap that made my kids love him and his skills on the CD backs up everything he does live. My kids are in there teens and they always tell me to bumb that Mike Phillips and I think that means alot cuz jazz mostly is kinda corny to them.KEEP Doing your thing MIKE!!!!!!
3,Throughly disappointed!!!!!,"I have been waiting for this CD for quite sometime and have to say, Mike you could have kept this one. Did anyone else notice that he has one song on the album twice? Back to back! Not to mention the many wrong notes played throughout the entire album. While trying to sound technical in many of his sequences, he made lots of mistakes and did not bother to correct them. Better luck next time."
3,A truly Awesome talent.,A gifted player but disappointing compared to his jaw dropping debut u have reached...
4,my 2 cents,"I felt compelled to to wrie a review. very impressed. A well put together CD. I love #6 'minnie', #5 'even if it takes all night' #3 'crazy' #12 'uptown on a saturday night and #2 'uncommon denominator'. I can't get enough of it. Just a beautiful, smooth grove that induces you to just close your eyes and feel and listen. If you love or like , paul taylor, ronnie jordan, marcus miller, then this is your style and you will enjoy his style."
2,Mike should have kept this one,I bought this album and was highly disappointed. This is not as good as his first album. I think that he needed to go back to waymen Tisdale to produce this one.
3,Cool ! With Regina Belle and Will Downing in concert !!,"Mike is a talented,uncommon sax player...I like this one,he's getting better and better !!I can't wait to catch him LIVE at the BJCC Concert Hall in Birmingham,AL in the next days !"
2,certainly not the best gay novel of that year,"i was a judge for the lambda literary awards in the poetry category during the year this book was nominated. not only was this novel not the best of the five nominees, none of the five nominees was the best book of the year. the best book of that year, and, perhaps, one of the best gay books of the decade, was SEA OF TRANQUILITY by paul russell. read that novel and leave this lightweight winner on the shelf."
1,Not worth the shipping and handling,"I was very fortunite to run across this book in the library rather than purchasing it. I was able to dredge through the first hundered pages with no hope of an actual plot line in sight. Granted there was quite a lot of detail concerning the report of the Warren Commision and if that is of particular intrest to you than by all means pick up the book. However, if you are expecting a story of Sherlock Holme's exploits and detective skills you are in for a big disapointment. The way that the story is written shows a very lacking knowledge of the characters of Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson. It seems as though the author placed the characters in the story just to grab readers attention and have them by the book."
5,serious scholarship presented in readable format,"This book presents a scholarly analysis of the events surrounding the JFK assassination, in a readable format--while faithfully capturing the essence of interplay between Holmes and Watson as they might bring their analytical prowess to bear on this historical puzzle. After seeing the movie JFK, I had the distinct impression that someone within the Oliver Stone company had been influenced by this book. This is an ideal book to take to the beach or cottage on a short vacation."
1,More Garbage from CBS/Paramount,"The Fugitive should've been licensed to a company that cares enough to properly release the show. Sad, sad treatment of one of the greats."
5,Truly joyous music,"This is a wonderful collection of music for thanksgiving - not just for the holiday, but for everyday. From the energetic opening, ""Tis By Thy Strength The Mountains Stand"", to the haunting ""Evening Hymn"" at close, this music is pure joy to listen to. The styles are quite varied and cover everything from plainchant to a somewhat modern take on Thoreau, and it is all very well performed. It is music that sends the soul soaring in thanksgiving to God."
3,"Cute, but...","The toys on this take-along arch are really cute, and they crinkle, rattle, and play music. However, the clips on the sides are just not wide enough to attach to anything I own... the stoller (Inglesina), carseat carrier (Britax), or infant seat (Fisher-Price). I can force it onto the stroller canopy, but it just either flops down or falls off altogether. And, as another reviewer wrote, there is no way that my 4-month-old can get the music to play just by batting at the toy... I have to hit it pretty hard to get it to work! My suggestion would be to try this toy out in the store before buying. Make sure it fits onto your stroller before you buy it."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this to clip onto our sons carseat for the road trips we take so that he would have something to look at. First of all it wasnt green and blue like it said, it was pink purple and yellow. The arch would not stay clipped on and the tiniest bump would send it flying into our sons face. The turtle ""sings"" which is cute but it plays the same 10 second clip every time it hardly swings which can get annoying after a 9 hour trip! The only good thing was that my son really liked the toys hanging from it and we were able to take them off the arch and hang them onto his carseat with some colored rings that we got from Walmart. Overall we were really disappointed with this."
5,Infectious,"The first second you put this on you wonder what's wrong with the sound quality, relax, within minutes you will be weaving round the room like a mad old dervish, wondering why on earth you too cannnot sing like this even though you try."
2,Another RipOff,"While I have thoroughly enjoyed watching Star Trek, this is yet another instance of Paramount blatently milking their one true cash cow and ripping off the fans. The price they charge for these dvd sets compaired to what other dvd sets cost is basically criminal. They should be ashamed of themselves."
1,Nice try...,"This is really not that hot.First of all it is overpriced, as one previous review demonstrated. The price per episode of the TV series is about twice as high as for any other DVD set of TV series that you can buy.Second, it is missing Star Trek - The Animated Series, so it does not include all official Star Trek material.This is clearly aimed to be an overblown Christmas present for the aging Star Trek fan by his family, but believe me it won't do the job."
3,"Well, Not All of Star Trek",Besides being WAY too expensive (thanks again Paramount for ripping off the fans) this set is missing the animated series. I think I'll have to pass on this one.
1,1 star for pricing,"Its not Paramount's fault really. Those rabid trekkies will pay anything for their precious Star Trek on DVD. Paramount knows this and prices everything accordingly. That's why I don't own any Trek except TOS and even then I waited for the bargain retailer price.I'd like to buy some seasons of some of the shows, but with the cheap packaging, minimal extras and high price tag, I'm not biting. Eventually after everyone has paid the inflated price, Paramount will lower the price. Unless you're a rabid trekkie that must absolutely have everything NOW, I advise waiting until the pricing comes back down to reality. There are many other shows which are just as good, if not better, than TNG, DS9, Voyager and Enterprise."
3,"No subtitles in Spanish or other languages, and too expensive","First of all, I'm a fan of the series, specially The Next Generation which was my favorite (and the series's two-part finale ""All Good Things"" was probably the best 2 hours of television I have enjoyed in my life), but seriously, why charge so much? Make this US$999 and not only would the studios still be making insane amounts of money, but I bet they'd sell WAY more copies as well.Also, how about subtitles in other languages other than English? Star Trek is one of those series that has a huge following all over the planet, and neglecting that 30% of its audience speaks spanish is a bad choice from the DVD producers. I'd love to buy this series and send it to my folks for christmass, but they barelly speak english."
1,red a magor sci fi fan,"The price even though is steep (that as so many people have pointed out) and even if it was affordable I still wouldnt buy the complete ser thats becuase I only prefered the orginal and tng and maybe all the movies the rest like voyager,ds9, and enterprise 9 (which some may diasgree) werent worth the time to buy. So many who do agree with me on the 3 orginals as the more entertaining then this defently isn't worth the money"
3,Definitely not the ultimate collection - HD TV coming soon,"I'm sure that having all the material would be cool, but what about the fact that HD TV is right around the corner? The film reels can be rescanned at higher HD resolution to produce better digital content. Won't people who pay this much money fell a little crappy when a few years from now their ""ultimate star trek collection"" looks crappy compared to the other material they are capable of viewing."
3,Great material. Insane price.,"Right after Christmas 04, the price for season 1 of the x-files dropped from about $100 to $35. I grabbed it off amazon. 2 weeks later, it was back up to $100. Now a year later, the price is dropping again and it looks like for good. The behind the scenes story here is pretty easy to read: The marketers set the price high (like an overpriced house) and hoped it would sell and probably sold few. Then finally the price dropped, thousands of x-heads like me grabbed it cheap. The price went back up and it didn't sell. It took another year for the marketers to figure out the x-files season dvd's will not sell for a premium price.Right after Christmas 06 the price for seasons 1 - 3 of TNG was cut in half. I own them now. Seasons 4 - 7 are still sky high and actually getting higher. But they won't sell. Fans aren't stupid. We'll wait until the marketers wise up and price this stuff reasonably. Until then, we'll watch seasons 1, 2 & 3 over and over again."
2,Most of Star Trek will NEVER be in Hi-Def!,"The ONLY Star Trek series that can be released in Hi Def is the ORIGINAL SERIES. That show was shot and finished on film. It won't be widescreen, but the masters are on film so hi def resolution is supported.However, Next Gen, DS9, Voyager and most of Enterprise was SHOT on film, but edited and finished on NTSC VIDEO (in fact TNG was the first show ever to do this). That means the master tapes for these shows are all 525 line video and they will never look better than they do on DVD. It is physically impossible to release them in hi-def.Enterprise switched over to 16:9, but it was not actually finished in hi def until late in the game.The movies can all be hi def, except for (sadly) the new edition of ST: The Motion Picture. The special edition director's cut was only finished on NTSC and can never be upscaled to HDTV. Only the original theatrical version can be re-scanned to a higher resolution.Use this info to plan your purchases accordingly!"
3,"A very nice collection, but way too expensive","Although it would be very nice to be able to pick up every piece of Trek ever shown on television in one massive swoop, the price here is just outrageous - especially compared to other television shows. Compare the cost here to the price of a season of other television shows:A season of West Wing - $40A season of The Shield - $42A season of The Simpsons - $32A season of The Sopranos - $65A season of Law and Order - $30Yet in this mega-collection you end up paying a staggering $85 per season after you subtract out the cost of the movies. I would be curious to know how Paramount justifies such high prices for shows that have been off the air for years when recently-run shows that are still in production go for less than half the price."
1,Not What is Advertised,"When I heard about this collection I was quite excited. It would be an opportunity for me to get all of Star Trek at a reasonable price. However, ""The Ultimate Star Trek Collection"" does not contain all the Star Trek episodes, and it is not reasonably priced. The animated series from the early 1970s is missing. To me this is a big omission. I have seen most of the episodes of every series except the animated series. One of the reasons that I considered buying ""The Ultimate Star Trek Collection"" was that I would finally be able to see all of the animated series. Failing to include it makes this product much less appealing to me. The price is another problem. US$2500 is a lot of money, particularly for an incomplete collection. Until a true complete collection is available, at a reasonable price, I will continue to get my Star Trek fix on Spike TV on nights when I can not sleep."
1,Way too espensive!,"Paramount is charging way too much for all of the Star Trek series as compared to every other DVD box set. Another Paramount release, Macgyver, is below $30.00 per season, and yet they still have the nerve to charge $109.00 and more per season of Star Trek just because the fan base would pay it if they wanted it enough. Personally I am content to watch them in reruns until such a time that they reduce the price to no more than $200.00 for each entire series. They were great shows, but I would rather spend my money on Buffy seasons 1-7 for $169.99!"
5,Warning: This is guaranteed to grow on you!,"Well a few weeks back I saw a concert of Oliver and the ""Black Spirits"" in Prospect Park, Brooklyn. I have been listening to African Music a long time, and I have to admit I had never heard of Oliver. Well it took about three songs...and there you go, you cannot resist the beauty, talent and soul of Oliver Mtukudzi. I believe everyone that night in Prospect Park agreed: this was just an incredibly beautiful concert, that brought joy, communion and a few tears to all present. (and plenty of dancing)Now, just get this CD. Play it once, twice and watch out, by the third time, that's the only CD you'll be playing for a long time!Soul. Root. Spirit."
3,A good career review,I bought this album after seeing Tuku live in Washington and while it doesn't generally have the drive and life of his live gigs it is a good review of his work. Good to create that mood of Africa and contains great Zimbabwean style guitar work. If you enjoy African music you'll enjoy this.
5,Truly a legend.,"My interest in African music was sparked, like many others, by Paul Simon's Graceland album. As I listened to more and more music from all parts of this diverse continent, I found that I really loved the music of Zimbabwe. I was especially taken with 80s jit dance music and the the hypnotic mbira and chimurenga of Thomas Mapfumo. I had not yet heard of Oliver Mtukudzi. Then my brother gave me this album for Christmas in 2005. I was totally captivated by it and I turned many friends and family members on to it, especially my sons. In September of 2006, we were lucky enough to see Oliver and the Black Spirits at the Globalquerque world music festival that we have every year here in Albuquerque. Several of my sons and I met Oliver after the show and we found him to be a warm, down-to-earth human being who truly appreciated meeting his fans. I look forward to seeing him again in March of this year when he returns to Albuquerque for another show. it has been too long."
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A sterile and old-fashioned (in a bad way) war film, The Great Raid is about as perfunctory and bland as movies get; no wonder it sat on the shelf for years."
4,Great Movie! Good Book!,Took some time for the product to arrive. The product arrived in top condition!
1,How to make a good story boring,"Watching this movie, I am struck by how effectively they can take one of the most interesting and exciting stories possible, and make it drag out on the screen. The disappointment at the pacing of such great subject matter holds no bounds. Watching this moving is almost embarassing knowing how good this could and should be, and how poor direction, and what seems like a script which does injustice to pacing and drama can wreck what should be greatness. I won't even go into historical inaccuracies, or the completely ridiculous cover art showing a modern beretta as the pistol sidearm 40 years too early. Makes me wonder if this movie was crafted with apathy towards the subject, the audience and history instead of respect."
5,The Great Raid is a great movie!,"This movie is a stirring recounting of an event that is an often overlooked part of military history. I had the priviledge of seeing the movie with one of the surviving Rangers that conducted the raid. His comment was that it was quite faithful to the actual events, with the exception that they did not have quite the firepower the movie showed. Well worth seeing!"
4,A moving story that deserves to be told to a new generation,"I grew up with a dad who was a former marine and Vietnam Vet. As kids, my brother and I were forced to watch lots of military documentaries and movies. At the time I didn't like it very much, but it did leave me with a sense of pride in our military and an appreciation of what our fighting men and women have done and do for us today. ""The Great Raid"" follows a fine tradition of military movies from the past and while it is not flawless, it does tell a remarkable story very well. I was almost surprised at how good the movie was after reading several bad reviews at rottentomatoes.com. But then again, maybe the critics weren't basing their reviews on the movie's merits, but on their political views? Overall, the movie wasn't flawless. The number of plot lines sometimes took away from the central focus of the movie. However, its mistakes can be forgiven by its earnestness and its desire to do the story justice."
3,Visually Chaotic...,"OK, but the photography was unnecessarily contrasty, and did not allow us ""in"" visually as much as it should have, especially during the first half. I was frustrated as I tried my best to soak in the scenes. Also, for me the film didn't flow for me in a way that made comfortable sense. I wonder how another director and cinematographer would have handled it."
4,Great Movie About Real People,The Great Raid is a very good movie and what makes it especially so is the fact that it was based on a real incident. I first rented the movie and got so much out of it that I ordered one for my own video library.
4,good flick,"This is a powerful movie and the blu-ray makes it come to life. I enjoy the movie, and would recommend it."
4,"Response to The great skirmish, by Anthony Hand ""Tony"" ( August 23, 2006","Primary Sources: A Survivor of the Palawan MassacreOn December 14, 1944, as American troops under General Douglas MacArthur slowly advanced toward the island of Luzon, Japanese guards at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp on Palawan committed a terrible act. Herding their Allied war prisoners into trenches, they soaked the men with fuel and burned them alive.Utah native Eugene Nielsen, private first class in the 59th Coast Artillery, was one of the few who escaped. Filipino guerrillas transported the survivors to the island of Morotai, where Nielsen described his experience to an Army intelligence officer. News of the massacre reached the POWs at Cabanatuan, as well, and prompted the U.S. Army to embark on one of the war's most dramatic missions -- the Bataan rescue."
5,"Very moving, honest movie...",I applaud this movie for not attempting to get it's 'wow' from blood-saturated battle scenes but rather from the chain of events during this rescue of 511 POW soldiers. Very moving and 'based-on-facts' movie.
4,An historical movie but....,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movies, but I had some trouble with the casting, particularly Benjamin Bratt as the mission commander. He just didn't fit the part and the pipe didn't help. Beyond that, as far as I could tell, the movie was relatively accurate and told the story with an understanding of the time and conditions of the Second World War in the Pacific. I recommend it."
4,THE GREAT RAID,"THIS MOVIE REALLY TOOK ME BY SURPRISE. IT IS AN EXCELLENT STORY AND WE REALLY ENJOYED IT. TO MAKE IT EVEN BETTER, IT IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. WE WILL WATCH THIS ONE AGAIN."
1,Could have been The Great Raid,"The book is better, the movie is too long, too mushy, too subjective and fictioniolize kind of like the movie ""Pearl Harbor"", it does not tell the whole story, for entertainment purposes, it would be OK but there is really more to the story. If you want to know more what really happenned read ""Ghost Soldiers: The forgotten epic story of WWII most dramatic mission"". There was no nurse in the real event based on the book, she was a madam running a bordello for the japanese but in reliaty the bordello was only a front to get information from the japanese and also provide the prisoners with news, and medications."
1,Does not tell the true story,"I read the book Ghost Soldiers before watching the movie. I was highly disappointed at the dramatized version of the movie. The book tells the real story of the soldiers who were imprisoned for over three years (after being abandoned by their country) and the Ranger company that rescued them. The movie only tells the story of the rescuers.The real story lies in the atrocities committed by the Japanese. The American soldiers and the Philippino civilians who endured starvation, diseases, cruel treatment, torture and cowardly murder at the hands of their captors deserve to have their story told. This Hollywood version of their story does not do them justice."
1,DVD Full-Screen Rip-Off of a Great Film,"I think this film is excellent, worthy of five stars. I am rating the DVD. Miramax is forcing people to buy the extra edition with the book, for $40 in stores. That is the only way to get the widescreen version. If you just want the widescreen DVD, you cannot get it. The bare-bones DVD (not even a trailer) comes only in fullscreen! I went all over town checking it out. Typical Miramax, over-pricing its DVDs. Watch out if you buy one of the their older DVDs, as many of them came only as non-anamorphic- that way, they could release another issue in anamorphic format. I hate that company."
4,The Great Raid,I thought that it was one of the most realistic movies of what really happened on Bataan even if they never mentioned all the atrocities that actually happened there like beheadings that were too many to list. I guess the reason that I liked the movie as my father was a prisoner at Cabanatuan and was shipped to Japan 2 week prior to the raid for slave labor
5,Great movie that was underated,"This is an excellent movie about the (probably) the greatest rescue mission in World War II. After reading the book, Ghost Soldiers, by Hampton Sides several years ago. It was delightful to see this movie made."
3,"A miltary rescue ,against the odds","In a nut shell:This movie documents the rescue of American Pows-from a Japanese camp in the Philopeans.The American rescue team consist of 124men and a handfull of Filopeano gorillas:Against nearly 1000 Japanese troops.The story explores the feelings of the prisoners and the under ground Rebels of the Philopeans.Putting a very ruthless face on the enemy.It has a feel good American ending(should of realeased on 4th of july week).The cast,story and fight sequences are all good.But I found the story drops(for story purpose)a couple of times slowing the past.Also it seems too be a bit to one sided for me.I round it down too a 3 from 3.5.But highly recommend this movie if Historical pictures is your thing."
1,Cheesy.,"This DVD is just too cheesy. I bought it because it was so cheap, so I thought why not. But it's not even worth receiving for free honestly. The ghosts that pop out do not surprise you, nor are they scary. Even for my young kids. And the noises just got way too annoying to even leave it on in the background during our Halloween party."
5,Letters of the Scattered Brotherhood,Book arrived on a timely manner and it was exactly as described - very good condition.
5,A Spiritual Classic,"Have purchased many Letters of the Scattered Brotherhood over the years for gifts. It's an inspirational book that can be opened anywhere to find the perfect words to help you through life. I'm so grateful that it's still in print. My hardback from many decades ago is a true friend, nearly falling apart from use but I would never give it up."
5,This is the one.,"The Letters of the Scattered Brotherhood is the best book I have ever owned. I bought it many times at used book stores to give to friends since I found my own copy in the early 1980s. I am so glad to see that it was reprinted in 1991. Now I just order it from Amazon. This is a book that I have never read from the front to the back. I have always just closed my eyes for a moment then opened it. It is ALWAYS on the right page. Not magic, just real. 5 stars plus a heart. Buy this book. Your answers are in it too. Then listen."
5,my personal daily guide to increasing faith,"I came across this book that was being discarded by the Quaker meeting I was attending. Since then, I have read one of the letters each morning and evening before my meditations. Sometimes I read the same letter over and over until its meaning penetrates my consciousness. Though I have read this book over 20 times, each reading is fresh,and brings new wisdom and confidence and joy. And it seems to have a magical quality- each reading feels as though it was written specifically for the issues that I am grappling with at that moment. I have always thought of it as my own personal book, given to me through some act of grace. I am so glad to read that others have responded to it in a similiar way. It is truly a great spiritual guide, simple and profound."
5,FINAL COUNTDOWN ORIGINAL SOUNDTRCK,"THIS MOVIE IS A FAMILY FAVORITE AND WHEN WE FOUND THIS SOUNDTRACK, JUST HAD TO HAVE IT,VERY ENJOYABLE. ITS PLAYED A LOT AT HOME AND IN THE CAR"
5,Great movies have great soundtracks !!!!!,"In 1982, a movie was released depicting the U.S.S. Nimitz going thru a storm and being transported back in time to Dec. 7th, 1941, just before the attack on Pearl Harbor.This movie had stars, Kirk Douglas, Martin Sheen,Catherine Ross, James Farentino, but the biggest star of the movie, was the Nimitz herself. Along with all the action and intigue, the sountrack was spot on and it went well with the story. It stuck with you, and I had always wanted to find it but never could.Amazon came thru with flying colors !"
5,Matches the sheets,Perfect match to the matching sheet set. To bad these aren't on sale as well as the sheet set! Reccomended if ya need them!
5,"Listen to this one and you'll be pushing the ""repeat""-button","""The Love for the Love"" is an excellent album! Not so raw like ""Driving you insane"" but also great! ""Main Bait"" is like on ""Driving you insane"", the psychadelic one at the beginning! With ""I don't care"" you come down into the mood! The hammond organ on ""disconnected"" is great! When i heard ""resolve"", all the little hair on my arms and neck are standing up! Like in a Horror-Movie! Fantastic! I love the lyrics of ""Just the gardener"" and the guitar-solo is delicate! A happy song! I think the difference to ""Driving you insane"" is, that Ann took more waight into the lyrics! Her banjo on ""The river"" sounds great. A fantastic banjo! It sounds marvelous! ""The River"" is the best one! Great banjo! ""Ecstasy"" is a very good combination of lyrics and music! And at the end, it's like i wrote at the beginning, ""Main Bait"" is the psychadelic one! A wonderful end! Fantastic! But I think ""The Love for the Love"" is the darker album! Ann did a good job!"
2,Mislead by book title & description.,This book was more of a historical fiction genre and so it was not really useful for a high school research paper. Time crunch did not permit time for a casual reading of this book.
5,Little House on the Prairie - I'll Be Waving as You Drive Away,"All 9 Seasons of Little House on the Prairie provided wholesome entertainment for the whole family... God is mentioned in nearly every episode and people are encouraged to have love, compassion and understanding of each other. You just can't find entertainment like this on DVD or TV anymore.. :-) If there were more than 5 stars to rate Little House on, I'd make it the BEST!!"
3,More Ways Than One,"When buying this opener, I thought the word Sharper referred to the brand. Well, my wife cut herself on the first can she opened. The opener cuts the side of the can instead of the top. The lid itself is not sharp, but the can is! This opener works well, but keep it away from kids. Better safe than sorry."
1,Don't be cheap,"The can opener sounded great, but reality was that I was putting batteries in every few days-buy a good electric opener or you will be sorry."
1,Profoundly Disappointed,"For those not well-schooled in the vocabulary and techniques of verse, the book is an exercise in frustration. The author seems more interested in showing how clever he is than actually explaining different poetic forms. I was profoundly disappointed with the book . . . a real waste of money. My advice for the neophyte is, ""STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!"" Perhaps its a treasure trove for those with a substantial background in poetry, but for someone relatively new to this art form, I would urge them to buy something else."
3,alright,"but not as well put as Adams. the text provides basic instructions, but the approach is often unsimplified on many levels. not to say the challenge isn't worth the effort, but for anyone looking at a well deconstructed view of poetics, Adams proves far more accessible."
3,Not particularly useful,"Bit too witty to learn anything. The author is too busy being cute to explain anything very well. Also, only marking stressed syllables only does half of the job of scansion; marking both stressed and unstressed syllables provides a complete visual aid for discerning meter. Add to that the author's party-line views on free verse and you have a rather lame book. Consider this a book-length version of Coleridge's horrible little piece on meter. Timothy Steele's All the Fun's in how you Say a Thing is much better."
2,disappointing,Author launches into examples of concepts which were not previously explained. The examples he gives are often his own explanations in verse form. Not an easy book to understand. Perhaps would be worthwhile to a reader who is already familiar with the basics.
4,Thank you Mr. Hutchcraft,"It's hard to get my husband to read anything that's not fiction, let alone about childrearing. But Ron Hutchcraft didn't dissapoint me and has written a book that was easy to read for everybody. I love listening to Ron on the radio with his 5 minute ""A Word with You"" and this is the first book of his I've read. The book is good for all parents of any age and experience . It is written in a clear, straightforward format with examples from his personal life. I'm going to pass this book on to friends."
3,more like a biscuit or a hard cookie,"I think you will be dissapointed! THis is more like a biscuit and should be renamed as such! Its no ice-cream for earth residents! The cookie tastes good but just remember its not an ice-cream! For that matter , its also slightly overpriced!Gifting this would be more of a symbolic gesture to space-geeks."
3,It was ok.. over priced.,"The novelty of this item must have earned the price I paid for it (over $5), but the size of the product I received seemed like it was probably worth maybe $1.50 or $2. The product I received was also not in this shape, but it was a circular ice cream sandwich. It tasted great, but I knew it would; I've had this stuff before. It was gone way too fast, the thing was very small, but the photo leads you to believe it might be bigger... of course.When it arrived it was also broken in several places which caused it to sort of splinter and crumble while eaten..meh... wish I could just find a store that carried these, probably save money, and know what I'm buying as well!"
2,A waste of time. Go ahead and buy the 10-c.d. set.,"Someone as big as Frank Sinatra and The Beatles cannot be served even by the ""40 Greatest Hits"" out-of-print set (as great as it was). Go ahead and buy the ""Complete Hank Williams"" set. Hank's well worth it. Incidentally, a limited number of sets were produced (10,000), prices are already firming up, and you can pass it down to your descendents. They'll love Hank and will think they're listening to someone like George Washington or Abraham Lincoln. He was almost that big!"
4,Not as good as the second volume,"Hank Williams' music is among the finest in country music's history. He's got a voice that simply cannot be duplicated. And, in 1999, he got a collection in UMG's '20th Century Masters.'In 2006, Hank was given a second volume in the series. I, personally, prefer the second volume over this one, although this isn't a bad Hank CD. Both discs have 12 songs, and both are relatively skimpy, but volume 2 has 'Your Cheatin' Heart,' 'Kaw-Liga' and many other gems that this one lacks.This is, however, a nice set, nonetheless. 'Lovesick Blues,' 'I Saw The Light,' 'Hey Good Lookin',' and 'Move It On Over' all appear on this 12-song CD.This isn't a bad choice as your first Hank CD. The sound quality is excellent given how old the recordings are, and it's got a lot of best-of standards. But, you might want to check out Hank's second volume before this one.Highly recommended for the new or casual Hank fan."
3,outstanding book for the beginner,"This book is a wealth of information on the how to. It doesn't provide an answer on how to create the universe, but it covers enough of the basics that you could take over the project. From how to stand properly while using a saw, to how to use and maintain hand tools that have been lost and forgotten as antiques or replaced by power tools. This book provides the level of detail and explanation of how and where to use various types of joinery. The book gives a user a greater understanding of why a two hundred year old barn is still standing and in use and there isn't a single nail in it. The book even provides explanations of how and why certain nails are selected for any given job (bigger is not always better). The book covers in painful detail the use of a framing square (ever try to transfer a nine and one half degree angle from a six inch protractor, only to find it wasn't quite right and have ugly gaps in your project)."
4,Steel framing square section too tightly written,Steel framing square section too tightly written...the chapter is not for those that do not have any past experience with the steel framing square. This chapter leaves me wishing to ask additional questions...perhaps there is a Video
4,Beautiful illustrations and a warm and caring storybook.,"This is a cute and funny story of Amy, the dreamer and her patient and loving mommy. Margot Datz's illustrations created a pretty and colorful display of the landscape surrounding a gingerbread cottage on the Vineyard. Complete with mauvey wisterias and the detailed picture of flower seeds just sprouting in egg cartons on the window sills in Amy's bear's house. The whole book looks great. Elegant and a timeless story for children and their mothers."
2,Beware,"The tip of this splitter is so flimsy, where it plugs in the jack, that it's own weight causes it to fall down and lose connection. Would not have thought it from Belkin..."
2,3 plug phone jack,"I ordered this to plug in my internet, phone, and answering machine to the same phone jack. The price was good but the product not so much. The picture shows a white plug but I received a tan colored one. That looks just disgusting because everything else having to do with the phone jack and cords is white. It works like it should but I guess I will see how long that lasts. Also, shipping was a nightmare. I ordered a few days before new years and I just received it yesterday (1/7/12). I guess I would have expected more from a company like Belkin. I had to pay for shipping (which was only a dollar or so) so I expected to have this in around 4-6 days, not a week and a half. Next time I think I will just go to the local hardware store and get what I want not what they feel like sending me."
5,Saved a lot of trouble,"I can now plug two pnones (my husband wanted an old-fashioned rotary dial phone instead of the radio phone I had) and a fax machine into one jack, which really beats having to pay for having more jacks put in!"
1,AWFUL! claims it's non permanent-I WISH,"The red color came out a weird orange red on my bangs because they are so thin, and a normal auburn on the rest of my hair. After awhile the orange faded a little but it's still there. I wish the directions had mentioned it would color different hair different shades if you have hair that's thinner in a certain section. Oh well, I thought- At least it says it will only last about 6 weeks. That's why I used it. It's now been 3 months to my absolute horror!! I have tried various things to get this awful color out of my bangs but it's not working and it looks extra stupid with my regular color coming in. I will NEVER use this product again."
3,Not what I expected,"First of all, the guitar is not RED, it's black with a dark red touch, but thats ok. The desctiption says full set of strings - LIE , just the first string came with it xD , also the gig bag is terrible and the guitar was slighly damaged on the side, but the sound quality of the guitar is not bad, that's why I gave it 3 stars, not what expected but a good deal at a good price."
5,Great deal!,You can set different tones and tunes well. The picks that come with it last and work well. I would recommend this for anyone that want a whole set for cheap.
4,Great Solo Debut,"Really like this album. Gift of Gab is one of my faves. Not the same without his DJ, but this effort shows the promise of things to come as he deepens his collaborations with this new group."
4,It's worth the purchase....,"The solo album from Gift of Gab is no doubt worth the price of admission. I've always enjoyed Blackalicious, and the recent run of Quannum records has been nothing short of quality, with this CD being no exception. Every one loves Chief Xcel, for good reason, but I was even more ecstatic when I learned that Jake One would be on a majority of the beats. He's good, sometimes great, sometimes leaves you wanting more - and while there aren't really any poor tracks on the CD, I wouldn't consider it as strong as the Lifesavas debut, maybe a tad better than Lyrics Born's solo effort. Vitamin D is adequate. Gift of Gab of course does just fine. He can stay on beat like few MC's, and the content is what you would expect. Just don't expect Blazing Arrow..."
5,one of my fav's,by far my early favorite for album of the year with vast aire's look mom no hands..the production change for this album (losing xcel for the solo album) provides a much different vibe and ill take it as just that different.. not better or not worse.. just plain greatgift can rhyme like anyone in the game right now and the beats just flow.. well done gift
2,Mostly overrated,"Gift of Gab's first solo album, 4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up, is a candidate for most adequate release ever. Typically motor-mouthed Blackalicious emcee Gab usually draws you to his tracks with an exceptional delivery, but here, little stands out as exceptional. Unfortunately, even less seems as though it will be remembered in a couple of years. On the positive side, the beats never get truly wretched nor does Gab get completely boring. It's just hard to call any of these songs better than OK. Even ""decent"" would be pushing it. ""Sufficient?"" That's more like it.For production alone, tracks ""Way of the Light"" and ""Hold On"" shimmy above the rest, meanwhile the gimmicky ""Flashback"" and ""The Writz"" fall flat. An album full of tracks as energetic and inspired as ""Just Because"" would stand the test of time, but ""Rat Race"" and most of the other faceless songs began fading away just after their release."
3,This is only the first episode,"This dvd is only the FIRST epsiode of the Transformers Animated series. Not sure why they even released this. If you have the ""Transformers Animated: Transform and Roll Out"" DVD, has the first three epidodes including this one.It is a bit of a waste of money unless you are collecting it for the cover artwork. You get better bang for your buck by buying the Transform and Roll Out."
5,excellant,I'm really pleased with my Seiko watch. It is very nice and It was really just as showed on amazon thanks and I'll be doing more business with Amazon and have referred you to my daughter.Linda Owens
4,Workable case,"Was looking for a case that would be as functional as the one for my Palm Vx. This isn't it -- you've got to remove the PDA from the case to use a cradle charger/sync connection. I also found the snap closure slightly annoying, but again, a change from the nice, slick cases for the Vx. All in all, this is a functional, well constructed item that serves its purpose just fine."
4,great little case,"Fits the TX just fine. I prefer the leather to the other hard or plastic cases available. Looks more like a book and feels comfortable in hand. I'm sure the others offer better protection, but this is sufficient for light commuting, around the house."
3,"ok product, but came ripped","product is bulky and will not fit in a pocket unless that pocket is empty.The biggest disapointment was that is came with a rip on the inner spine.It came in the original package ( I think ) so it may have been bad from the factory, although , the seller could have repackaged it. who will ever know?"
3,"pleased, but sharp corner on item","Fits the palm well, very durable...seems to have come with a sharp corner or something on it..like a piece of the plastic that holds it together and forms it is sticking out and is sharp."
1,Not all people that are using a palm looking for style,"This is a good case if you are not going to use your palm at all. It looks real nice but it just does'nt hold up to acual use. The case leaves a mark on your screen after a while of use, so use a screen protector and plan to change it twice as much as you usualy do. nite ize has nice functional case that is durable for about the same price its not stylish but it has lasted alot longer than this piece of crap."
4,Very good for TX,"The case is sturdy and fashionable looking for men and women. It works very well with the TX, no problems using it or plugging things in. Only downside is it slides out a little bit, but thats only if you turn it upside down. It has spots to hold the stylus, credit cards and extra SD cards. Overall I'm very pleased."
4,Fits the PalmT/X,Fits the Palm T/X palm pilot. The inside of the case is real cheap suede. I wish it were leather because the suede picks up dirt and dog hair. Otherwise it is a fine case; it is nice to have a pocket or two to slip a piece of paper or a lost button into.
3,TOO BULKY,"HIGH quality leather. Very nice craftsmanship....It was just too bulky for my front shirt pocket....I gave it to my dad, and he loves it...but then again, he is not putting it in his front pocket."
2,Purchased for Palm TX based on the prior glowing reviews.,"I purchased this case for my Palm TX, based on the prior glowing reviews. I was looking for a nice book-style case made in soft leather. I recently up-graded from a Palm VX with Palm case.This case is far from a perfect fit for the Palm TX, which is suppose to be the same size as the Palm T5. The top of my PDA protrudes out of the case about 1/4 of an inch. The PDA would crack if dropped on its plastic top edge. The case blocks the top portion of the screen, making it difficult to access some of the menu options. I find my self constantly removing the PDA from the case to use it. The case is not a good choice for the Palm TX. Also, the leather is too slippery for my taste. I fear dropping the unit. The case has a cheap snap to keep it closed. I don't think the snap will last very long.After reading the prior glowing reviews, I am scratching my head."
1,poorest of the leather cases yet.....,"This is the fourth or fifth Palm branded leather case I've purchased over the years, and probably the worst design and quality. The SD card slots do not hold the cards, particularly the WiFi card which would continually fall out; additionally there is no cover for them as in past models. The ""quality suede"" interior and fastener do not fit my definition of ""quality,"" looking rather like something at your local dollar store. Fit is not good and cut-out for connectors is off center in miine. Best case I ever bought from Palm was for one of the original black and white PDAs and quality and design seems to have gone down hill with every further purchase. I'll be buying something else...."
1,Does NOT fit a Palm TX,"I bought this case because it was supposed to fit a TX-but it really does not. The screen is cut off at the top and you have to take the entire PDA out to access menus or anything at the top of the screen. It also gets very loose over time, which means the PDA won't stay snug in the case and it can slip right out the top."
4,Palm Case,"I like the style of this case the best of all that I have seen. Although it is a little thick, it works well in protecting my Pilot."
1,This broke the screen on my Tungsten E,"Do you see those slots to hold credit cards and such?If you put credit cards in them and then fill up the wallet with cash and receipts... beware, the screen can break where the credit card touches the Palm screen.This happened to me and Palm offered me a 25% discount to replace the screen."
5,best case,"My Palm was getting beat up in my purse, so I purchased this one. It's quite nice with pockets inside for receipts or cards, whatever. The leather seems like it's quality, and so far, I love it! I have a Palm TX which fits perfectly."
5,Great case!!,I have not had any problems with this case since I began carrying my palm. It is sleek and compact.
1,Useless,"Not quite as useless as the half flip cover provided as standard equipment but I wore out my IBM Palm C3 before upgrading to a T5 and I'm very diappointed that the T5 doesn't come with a leather ""flip"" case like the C3. A flip case allows users to plug into their desk top USB cradles without removing the Palm from the case; this is impossible with the T5 leather case. I returned my 'genuine' T5 leather case on day 2 and for now hope my little half leather flip will protect my Palm until I discover a decent leather case that is desktop USB friendly. HELLO anybody at Palm listening?????"
2,PALM TX CASE,"I WOULDN'T BUY AGAIN! WHEN CASE OPEN, TX SLIDES OUT. SD CARD POCKETS HAVE NO RETENTION AT ALL! CASE COVERS SCREEN EDGES. DON'T BUY."
4,I think it's great,"I was plesantly supprised at how nice this case seemed. Not as nice as the Coach one I had for my palm viix, but it seems to be high quality. It affords protection for the palm. the fact that it doesn't fit in my shirt pocket is cool -- the T% is a big device, and that is an expected trade off.It fits my palm security, the cutouts line up perfectly, and my wifi card seems to be held in place securely.It is not a Coach, but it is only 23 bucks."
3,Palm Leather Case,Product is okay. Not the best quality but does protect the Palm and does make it easier to transport around.
4,Great case for the money,"I am more than happy with this case. It fits my Tungsten perfectly. The clasp is not to tight, and it looks more than decent. Great case, don't hesitate to buy it."
2,"what is this, leather?","I agree with everything English has written above me, but i wanted to add that the ""luxurious suede interior"" is anything but that. It is like felt on plastic, which makes me doubt if the genuine leather exterior is that at all."
4,Does the job at a good price,"This is a good looking case that provides good protection for the T/X. I don't have any problem with the fit. Plugs etc are accessible. A few complaints:1. Hard for headphone jacks to fit flush to the TX so I only get ""mono"" instead of stereo2. Have to take the palm out of the case, to properly connect it to power and sync cables. I think #1 and #2 here likely have something to do with the contours of the TX also.3. The slot that I assume is to be used to hold an extra stylus will not hold one securely, so I don't use it4. I would like the closure tab to be leather for added durability.Having said all this, it does look nice and it protects the palm with minimum inconvenience."
3,Losing card.,"I believe that if someone, by accident, pushes the card side (which is open) against something, the extra card may come off and you won't notice. That's not something cheap to loose. So, the cases that folds towards the upper side will protect your card when the case is closed."
1,Disappointed,"Ithought that when bought this case it would be the best but it turned out to be a disappointment. My TX slides back and forth , the case is approx 10 months old and the front snap is broken. Now I own a piece of junk. Looking to replace it with a flip type case that hopefully will give a snug fit. Also the card compartments allow the card to protude and that scratches the pscreen, luckily I have a protector on it that I changed twice already in 10 months."
1,Screen Breaks,"This phone was fine for about month, when both screens began blanking out. I took it back to the store and was advised to simply remove the battery for two minutes, then the screen would come back. I did this and it seemed to work. After another month, the screen began blanking out more and more. Finally, after about 5 months of use, the screen would blank out continuously - maybe 15-20 times a day.Several people I know have the same issue with this phone - it is clearly a defective model. The people in the Verizon store all know this too, since any one of them will tell you the battery trick to get the screen working again. Don't bother with this phone."
1,The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service,"I've had my this phone swapped 3 times. 2 of which were in the last 2 weeks. Verizon didn't want to replace the load of crap. The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently. This is just awful. Save your self a headache get a motorolla."
1,JUNK,this cell phone is a hunk of junk the color on the screen si anything but lucios and the screen is tinya huge flaw is the fact that if you call someone ocassionaly it will just ecko what you say and you cant hear the other person.GET SAMSUNG THEY ARE WAY BETTER THAN THIS HNK OF TRASH!!!!!!!!!
2,A user friendly phone with poor quality & reception,I am on my 5th VX4500. The signal on this phone fluctuates like crazy. You can have a full strength signal and suddenly the phone will drop the call. I have had several LG phones (TM-510; VX1; and VX6000) and they all were superior to this phone. The last time this phone broke I temporarily activated an old Kyocera phone that was about to be donated to the goodwill and it blew this thing away.On the bright side this phone is user-friendly and has a nice interface. The speaker phone is decent as well. Too bad it can't hold a signal. Save your money and get something better.
2,Not a book about EMS,"this is not a book about EMS or really even just being an EMT. It is about one woman's mental, physical, and emotional issues. it is not imspirational or even informational. Just sadly pathetic."
2,Funny? Or uneducated?,"Jane Stern's writing is witty, descriptive and informative. However, I was surprised that she would continually use such crude terms for bodily parts and functions. Was it an attempt at humor? I don't know. I found it extremely offensive. It made an intelligent woman appear as an uneducated one."
3,'Lifetime Movie',This was ok for a 'made for tv' movie. I didn't notice it was a 'Lifetime Movie'. I was expecting a 'real' film.
1,Not even close....,From my point of view this book captured the escence of EMS in a way that has nothing to do with the medicinal refrence. Im an Volunterr EMT in one of the posh towns of fairfield county and she whines about our good equipment and she thinks having an ambulance with transmission fluid leeking from the bottom is some high honor. If you want to save peoples lives you need the best equipment. I just believe her ignorance to the rest of fairfield county for having to much money is annyoing/
5,All female EMT's are Ambulance Girls,I loved this book. It was so funny! It reminded me of how i was when I went through EMT school. I also watched the Lifetime Movie and it was great also.
4,Entertaining,"I stumbled across this book while looking for a road food book by Jane and Michael Stern. I didn't think it was the same Jane Stern--I didn't know about this part of her life, only having listened to Jane and Michael on NPR""s ""The Splendid Table"". Jane's personality really comes through in the pages of this book. She's chatty, vulnerable and fun to read. I found myself getting very easily caught up in her story."
4,Enjoyable read,"Having listened to Jane Stern on NPR it was interesting to read her frank, open, wonderfully descriptive book of her life, which was 180 degrees different to what I would have imagined."
4,Inspirational with great sense of humour,"I really loved this book - Stern's honesty and self-deprecating humour are very refreshing and I could really relate to her search for meaning and efforts to overcome her worst fears. Stern is not afraid to describe her struggles and triumphs in a way which made for some laugh-out-loud moments as well as some reflective ones. Working in the health industry myself I could relate to much of what she was describing, but I think this book would appeal to all readers who have ever thought about jumping over their own shadow and drastically changing their life. All in all I found this book inspiring, humorous and uplifting and I admire Jane Stern for overcoming her fears and jumping in the deep end!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this for our bathroom because I always hate when I'm at someone else's house and I have to fumble around in the dark bathroom for the light switch. This thing barely lights up. You'd almost have to walk into the room several feet, then turn around to see it. I had expected it to be a little brighter."
4,not for the faint of heart,"although i was initially shocked by the hard-core, uninhibited lyrics of bitch & animal, after listening to their incredibly clever lyrics and seeing the excellent show that they put on (opening for Ani DiFranco in Albany, NY)i was thoroughly impressed. Although I would not recommend this one to my grandmother, b&a introduce an innovative musical spin to gender/transgender performance art that is not only intelligent but highly entertaining."
5,tv as it should be,"i read all of the reviews prior to purchasing little house. editing seemed to be the biggest complaint. but because i loved this series so much, and have watched re-runs for years, i bought the pilot and seasons 1, 2, & 3. this is the kind of tv series our children & grandchildren should be watching. they should know the joy of a family who works & struggles together for the greater good. while the editing may not be top notch, it is far better than anything offered on regular television today."
3,Follows the book...,"Pretty much the pilot movie for the series that is to follow. The DVD has little in the way of extras - really just the movie. The movie follows the book. The family leaves the Big Woods because too many people are moving into the area. They face hardships, wolves, strangers, Native Americans. If you have red the book you know what will happen in the end. Frankly, the whole thing, even if you do now know the events from the book, seems a tad predictable. Even the ending is not going to shock you very much - once again even for those who have not red the book. If I hadn't red the books, and seen many of the episodes of the series that grew out of it, I don't think I would have watched it. And I don't think I will be watching it again either. Seems slow and a tad bland."
2,"Very good movie, bad product","The movie is very good and the video quality is beautiful, but the package is really bad. Video encoding is terrible and on many players doesn't work properly."
4,Little House on the Prairie,good classic pilot launched a classic tv show. it was a good show / pilotLittle House on the Prairie - The Pilot
3,"Beautiful Video, Awful Sound","This certainly brought back memories and I am glad I bought it. That said, I have to also report that the sound quality is terrible. The volume vascillates between barely audible and rock-band loud. The dialogue reproduction is muddy at all times while the background music seems to have been replicated perfectly."
5,little house pilot,"I love this show very much. The pilot movie is excellent, it stays close to the book ""Little House on the Praire."" by Laura Ingalls Wilder. It a good start off point to the Little house tv show."
5,Little House on the Prairie - The Pilot,"Totally my favorie of all the Little house on the Prairie Christmas Movies. However, they are all very good. and I will watch it many more times."
2,Little House of the Prairie-The Pilot,Came in new condition. The movie itself is not very good quality. I would not recommend getting this movie. If you have the entire set the scenes are in the first set and much better quality.
2,bruised cans,"I have bad arthritis, so I wanted to start ordering the canned dog food instead of having to carry it from store. When I recieved the shipment, each and every can was dented, but in all random places. I felt like the company must have given Amazon all of the ones they knew they couldn't sell to the pet food chains. SO I won't order dog food again from Amazon."
1,Was surprised with the layer of fat on top of contents.,"I had heard this was wonderful canned food, so I tried it for my very fussy schnauzer. I was first surprised to see a layer of fat on the top when I opened the can....I scraped that off and added a couple spoonfuls to her dry....and she sniffed it and walked away. She does seem to like the Merrick BG dry food. I chose the buffalo flavor and my girl says this is a winner."
3,My Dog Loves This Food,"My little Lhasa Apso mix was diagnosed with diabetes a couple of months ago, so I found Merrick's Grammy's Pot Pie to be low glycemic, and decided to try it. He loves this food! It has chunks of potatoes, carrots, and peas, not to mention chicken and apples. The only downside about ordering it from Amazon is the delivery method. The day the food was delivered, a van pulled up in front of my house and left the 5 cases of food I had ordered outside of my chain link fence next to the mailbox. Needless to say, someone could have taken it if I hadn't seen the delivery woman drop it off. I'm also disabled, and if it hadn't been for my next-door neighbor being outside at the time, I couldn't have gotten the cases of food into my house without her help. Many of the cans were also extremely dented. Delivering items this way is not acceptable. I would have given this review 5 stars if it hadn't been for the delivery."
1,CAUTION/DENTED CANS,"I have a special needs pet and searched for the right food. Since Amazon has been a five star resource I chose to have Pot Pie shipped. Many of the cans are dented. So I have to toss them or return. This is a big hassle but would not ever feed a dented can to my beloved boy. Best to purchase at the pet store, evidently."
1,Please Think Twice...,"Please think twice about purchasing this product, especially if you have a small-breed dog. I was lured by the cute, gimmicky labeling and sold by the ingredient list, but I twice fed Merrick canned food to both of my dogs, and BOTH times, BOTH dogs were diagnosed with pancreatitis -- an illness which is dangerous, extremely painful to the animal, and which requires hospitalization. I'm not sure if the fat content in those particular cans was high, or if Merrick uses an ingredient/additive that somehow sickened both of my (unrelated) dogs, but this food made them very ill. After their second hospitalization for pancreatitis, I spoke with other folks who had stopped feeding Merrick to their small-breed dogs for the same reason -- the food caused vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy in their pets."
3,unfilled cans,"I've been feeding this wet food to my dogs for 3 years, and as my husband has said ""if you through it in a crock pot and served it to me for dinner i would have no idea it was dog food."" But i am a little upset with the fact that the cans aren't full. In this last case some were even only half full. I have 4 dogs and this stuff isn't cheap."
5,We Love Grammy's!,"We adopted an 8-year-old Dalmatian earlier this year, and heard lots of cautionary tales about special diet. But we couldn't pass up trying a can of this dog food--sadly, just because of the name. Well, she loves it! So now it's her special occasion food. We mix half a can with a cup of dry, 2X/day, with no nasty side effects. She also likes Wingaling and the Napa Valley offerings from this company. It's high in protein and works for us!"
4,"Kendo, not Iaido","This footage is all about live blade Kendo, not iaido. They made a mistake on the cover. However, the footage is still very interesting and fascinating to watch if you are into Kendo with a live blade. Also, the quality of the film is poor, but then again, where else can you get vintage footage of masters in Japan practicing live blade kendo."
2,BUYER BEWARE!,"Once again Don Warnner of Rising Sun Productions DECEIVES the buyer,the cover states iaido and shows a prominent Sensei of Toyama Ryu, Seiji Ueki Sensei all over the cover and disc itself,BUT NOWHERE AND ,I REPEAT NOWHERE DOES UEKI SENSEI APPEAR IN THIS VIDEO ,OR IS THER ANY INSTRUCTION IN CLASICAL IAIDO !!,This is just poor management of a company and an effort to deceive to make sales, very sad indeed.In my opinion mr. Warnner is a man of no Budo and misrepresents to make a buck! THIS IS JUST A COPY OF NIHON KENDO KATA !!! BUY THAT INSTEAD !!!Although the video itself is great for the material it contains , it should have been marketed acurately, VERY SAD don VERY sad!>>>>>"
1,You Got Played,"I may be the only person who thought this book was awful, the actual novel was 68 pages, the rest of the book was how to be a big freak. The only thing that will probably make this sell are the photos. The story was weak. The chics were simple and got used instead of using the baller. The idea of revenge was to satisfy the man and try to embarass them by asking for more sex."
3,"If you get it, it's hilarious.","I'm not going to give this 5 stars based on content, nor 1 based on length...that being said...This book is hilarious. After reading all the reviews posted here, I can't see how anyone wouldn't think so, but all were had. Complain about the sad social state, bad moral implications, or blatant 'truth' about the reverse-power of 'tha ballah-catcha'...this book is straight-up hilarious and can only be taken at face value."
3,"It was okay, but I needed more!","This book was okay, it wasn't as long as I thought. The pictures was cool, but I think it could had been a little better. I just needed more to read, don't get me wrong it was very interesting but short. Mysterious Luva I will be on amazon purchasing your next book (Baller Catcher) you best believe that. (Just make it a little longer)"
4,koontz stories,The Mask was intertaining. Sometimes he seems to get too far out into the ozone but the mask was OK. I wish he would write more along the lines of the Husband or Intense but you gotta love him!
2,No ending,"This was one of Dean's laziest books.I have read all of his stuff and man, can he get lazy. This one is bad if your a serious fan of his. He put no effort into it. The plot and characters were weak and predictable and the ending made keep flipping the last pages for more story thinking that this couldn't possibly be it!. If I have to use THAT much imagination there's no need to buy books.I miss the old Koontz. The ""ODD"" days, and Christopher Snow, ""Snowman."" I doubt he'll ever return. I won't be spending anymore time or money on Dean Koontz.I wrote to him and said so."
2,Not good -- not good at all,"Even if you like Dean Koontz you will probably not like this book. I do and I didn't.First of all, I loathe anything reincarnation themed but was unaware for some reason that this book had such strong overtones concerning just that. Combined with EXTREMELY coincidental things happening, this book fails to be entertaining on any level. It is overly long and concludes at the appointed time you can see coming.The characters? Who cares? They're not engaging nor exciting. The only excitement about this book is the prologue when ""Laura"" is in the basement.This is a very early Koontz novel so it really does not matter if he receives a very poor review, his later books were great and praised. So, even if you are desperate for reading material, skip this one after reading the prologue and read something more exciting, like the dictionary."
1,Totally Impossible and Dumb,"See review title, as it says it all. This is the 5th book I've read by Koontz, and worst yet. I am done with Koontz, thank you."
1,Hidden Behind the Mask is a Very Average Koontz Book,"This book is not up to the usual high standard of masterpiece quality work by Dean Koontz. It is a very slow paced novel with not much action. Most of the words within this novel are trying to get you attached to Carol and her husband and in fact you never really do get attached. I to be honest did not really care what happened to them. Likewise Jane Doe did not do much for me either and I couldn't have cared less halfway through the book if she got over her amnesia or not. There are a few cool chapters of a fight to the death between an old lady and her beloved cat but you've got get through a lot of boring chapters to reach this scene. There are far better Koontz novels out there to spend your money on instead of this one. Night Chills, Watchers and Intensity are three ones that I can remember just off the top of my head but there are more literature masterpieces by Koontz as well. The Mask is definitely not one of them though."
1,NOT typical Koontz! Disappointing!!!,"I would only buy this book if you're a die-hard Koontz fan and don't have any more you can order! I can't believe that he really wrote this book! It was suspenseful and kept your attention. The plot really had possibilities. But he definitely did not pull it off! The ending was atrocious! Really disappointing. If you're reading Koontz for the first time, DON'T READ THIS ONE!! You may wind up casting off one of the best writers there is! Most of his books are brilliant! But not this one!!!"
4,What Happened?,"I gave the book four stars because I did not like the way the book ended. The ending just left me hanging. I was surprised and very disappointed with how this book ended. This question keep running around and around in my head. The question is. What happened? I need an answer I can live with.However, the book was well written and interesting. I would go a far as to call the book a page turner. Maybe, I missed an important point in the book? But, I don't think I did.I recommend that you read the book. Maybe, you will have a better understanding of the book's ending than I did."
4,Good,It was better than The Taking but it was very predictable. I'm a little disappointed in the ending but at least it didnt end in tragedy.
2,Ending? What Ending...,"I really enjoy Dean Koontz and I really enjoyed The Mask, right up until the ending. Wait, what ending? There was no ending! I finished the page and turn it excited to see how the story would play out and was shocked to find there were no more pages. That was it? That was an ending? I'm so disappointed..."
3,Hate to do this...,"Dean Koontz is one of my favorite authors, so it saddens me to give this book three stars. It didn't even feel like a Koontz book.It was slow to start, mediocre in the middle, and it felt unfinished at the end."
3,"WHAT IS WRONG WITH U PEOPLE 2, 3 1/2 STARS","I don't know what some of the people who reviewed this book read? 1 or 2-stars?Granted, it wasn't DK's BEST book, but it was still an enjoyable read about REINCARNATION? Who expects a horror novel (okay maybe it's psychological horror)to be realistic? U read to get away for a while and forget the ""REAL WORLD.""This was a very good DK book that I gobbled up. It is quite good, but I'll agree not his best. However, it is a well told story and has sympathetic characters!!One of his earlier works!! A MUST-READ for ""Koontz-ite's."""
3,Very good,One of Koontz's better books. Read it a few times and the first chapter still gives me chills.
2,"Read it out of devotion to Koontz, but...","I have read almost all of his books, but this one was like The Funhouse - short, quick read, predictable, not intriguing, but fun. I read it in one day, it reminded me of the stuff I read in high school. I wonder how fast Dean whipped it out? (No pun intended). I like books on reincarnation, especially when it goes back a century or two and revolves around a tragedy (read Suffer The Children by John Saul - excellent), but I have to say that I'm glad my fellow Koontz-loving sister paid for the book and let me borrow it! I wouldn't have spent money on a paperback with an ending like The Mask. The ending did not allow for closure!!!! However, I remain a devoted fan."
1,"Sad to say, but...","Well, I like Koontz's books very much. I really do. I have read about ten of them, all pretty good. But... The story seemed like a good one, but, sad to say, as a book it leaves too much to be desired. The characters are very overacted, you just don't believe them. They are not characters, they are more like actors (bad ones) representing the story. And it is also oh-so-very predictable. You just don't care about what's going to happen. It doesn't move you (like other books by Koontz do, like Strangers or Watchers). Sorry..."
3,Predictable....,"it read like an R.L.Stien book, you know what's going to happen next but you read it anyway. Get this one from the LIBRARY!!"
1,Worst of the typical,"Koontz has written some pretty lame stuff, but I think that the Mask is his worst work. The man CANNOT seem to put anything other than sequal-ish endings on his novels, and this particular book was too anti-climatic."
1,a flop,"personally I didn't like this one. Not at all Koontz like, no thrills or suspense, just boredom and predictability."
2,The Weakest Koontz Novel I have Read,"I love Dean Koontz, and recommend many of his novels without reservation. THE MASK, however, is pretty bad. It's slow paced and lacks the fine character development that Koontz displays in his later work. The two main leads are ""goody two shoe"" type characters and possess almost no flaws. I didn't find them particularly believable or interesting.The final 50 pages of THE MASK are relatively action-packed, but you have to slow through 250 pages of boring setup to reach that excitement. The ending is limp and inconclusive, which made me feel like the whole book was a waste of time. This was one of those stories where I felt the underlying concept had enormous potential, but the execution was lacking.THE MASK was an early Koontz novel, written in 1980 under the name Owen West. My advice is to skip this minor effort, and focus on Koontz' stronger work, such as PHANTOMS, WATCHERS, LIGHTNING, INTENSITY and ODD THOMAS."
3,No Koontz,"THis was a little disapointing for me, i could not get into the book, usually i am hooked on the first page but it took me over 70 pages to get into it.I am sorry Koontz but this was not ur best work, but i still love you. I love Koontz work to much to put lower than 3."
2,"Not the worst, but...","Very Close! I'm very glad this was one of the last two books I had to read in the available collection. It was predictable (and I'm not one who even tries to figure out mysteries), and the lack of closure at the end was dissapointing. On the bright side it wasn't overly long and it was better than Demon Seed!"
1,thew away,"I purchased to use for pricing clothes for a children's consignment sale I was participating in. I never could get it work right. I had 4 other adults try to get it to work properly. After aggravating myself for way too long trying to get this cheaply made product to work, I threw it away and used safety pins on the clothes instead. Don't waste your money."
2,Slow and boring,Maybe I just did not get it. I sat through this thing because I have been a fan of Miss Dunaway's for quite some time. It is hard to sit through and makes little sense. Kirk Douglas is old and is messing around with Dunaway behind his wife's (Deborah Kerr) back. Douglas rethinks his life and changes it. About the only reason to watch this movie is to see a young post-Bonnie and Clyde Faye Dunaway.
5,Great Product,"This dvd was great! It has great guest singers. The ""Family"" song they sang was very enjoyable. My grandson loves it! Would highly recommend this one to all the Yo Gabba Gabba fans everywhere!"
5,Favorite Video!,"My son is obsessed with Yo Gabba. He loves every epidsode and this dvd was a huge hit. He watches it over and over. The lessons each teaches is perfect!! Very educational & entertaining. My husband and I find ourselves singing the songs, too."
5,My son's favorite!,My son loves this DVD! He watches it all the time. I love that The Roots are on there. So glad I bought it.
5,awesome,"My husband and I only have good things to say about Yo Gabba Gabba. My husband hates all kid shows and he loves this DVD. Great music, good lessons, and the family members in this one are so cute!!!"
5,son gives two thumbs up,My son loves yo gabba gabba. likes to watch this one just as much as the other yo gabba gabba dvds we own.
4,My daughter loves Yo Gabba Gabba,"So my daughter loves this show more than I can even convey in this review. I on the other hand, think the show is bizarre and find it an assault on my auditory senses. The songs grate on my nerves and the character's voices are super annoying. It's nice that I can pop in the DVD for a bit and get some cleaning done while my 2 year old is entertained so that alone is worth the annoyance."
4,Well Designed with new photos & quotes,"I'm a huge Andruw Jones fan so I ordered this as soon as it went on the shelf. Great for children, but it did include some quotes and photos I had never seen before."
2,Listeners beware,"This is yet another oldies CD that can't be fully recommended because not all of its tracks are the original versions.""Sugar Sugar,"" ""One Fine Day,"" ""I'm into Something Good,"" and ""Leader of the Pack"" are definitely in their original form.But ""Stand by Your Man,"" ""Little Darling,"" ""When a Man Loves a Woman,"" and ""Save the Last Dance for Me"" are definitely NOT the originals, but are contemporary re-recordings by artists who are now 60+ years old. In some cases not all of the original band members are still alive, and in the case of ""Stand by Your Man"" it isn't even the Tammy Wynette version but some other country singer singing it.I am not sure if the remaining two tracks--""Cherry Hill Park"" and ""Silence Golden""--are original or not, because I am not familiar with these songs.The sound quality of the CD is OK. The bottom line is that if you want an inexpensive CD that contains any of the 4 original tracks listed above, buy it. If not, be aware!"
3,Straight Up...Ned and the Guys playing pretty Fast,"In a whirlwind of fierce garage punk venom, the Action Swingers tear their way through an extremely quick set of songs on this live in the studio album. The album review provided compares this to early Black Flag (The first song is a cover of BF's ""Fix Me""), which is a pretty apt description. Fans of the thrashing early Flag will enjoy the cover and the faster songs. And if you are a fan of the Sonic Youth/Late 80s Noise genre, this band has plenty to offer on its slower numbers (though their album ""Quit While You're Ahead"" is alot closer to that vein as a whole).For those that don't like low production values or mono production in general, this album probably wouldn't be a very fun listen. But for a listener who enjoys bare basic garage punk and an extremely black sense of humor (Ned Hayden did after all write the ditty ""Kicked In The Head""), this album will be a fine addition to your collection."
1,Don't waste your money on this book!,"This book is poorly written, often repeating phrases over and over. I could find nothing endearing about either the hero, who seemed overly arrogant, or the heroine, who can only be described as annoying. I'm not even sure why I bothered to finish the book. Don't waste your money on this, you'll be disappointed."
3,Not That Bad Alabama,"For the characters, Rory Jones and Dominique Lindwall and their individual hang ups, they did weave a possible, passable life style. I do have problems with heroines who have kept their virginity and then suddenly give in to an importunate hero? [Is he a hero?] Seduction is the name of the game but where are the moral inner strengths of all of our women -- down the tubes. Ah well, that is when I begin to find a story boring. I do enjoy reading about Australia"
1,The Book of U.S. Postal Exams,Useless! Can't understand the hype about this book. The USPS provides most of the same information for free!!! No cross references for further study. The Dude high on himself! Eat Humble pie before he crows!!I just want the 932 and all I got the USPS so...?
5,postjob,This is a very good purchase. As I read it I was even more convinced that it is almost impossible to get into the post office. It gave a lot of good recommendations as to how to apply right and all the right guidelines.
3,great so far,"So far the book is great,the sample test in the book are the same as what the recruiters at the post office gave me,but the book give me details on what to study.I'll be taking the Electronics Technician exam next week,so depending on the score,my review may be even better. Rick Reynolds"
2,Lacks Reality,"I picked up this book thinking, ""Cool, a Gail Carson Levine book. I really liked Ella Enchanted and The Two Princesses of Bamarre so this one has to be pretty good even though it isn't a fantasy. It is by Gail Carson Levine.""I was wrong.The book's well written and has a semi-interesting plot but I felt that it lacked reality. Some characters seemed believable but others didn't. The popular group for instance, for the most part they were all nice girls. That's the problem! The popular group at schools are hardly EVER nice! I should know because I'm a teenager.Ms. Levine, please stick to fantasy. You write it soooo well!!! :) I'd much rather see your new books in the fantasy catagory instead of more reality based books."
5,The greatest book I ever read you REALLY get into it!,"I hadn't heard about this book until I came to Amazon.com. It was here that I bought the book. I took it to Italy when we went and I couldn't put it down! I started to read it in Venace amd finished it the next day. Every chance I got I picked it up, even if it was only for five minutes. When we got back to the U.S. i read it again. And now I take it almost EVERYWHERE! It is SO good.I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys a funny, witty, and altogether uplifting book."
2,No wonder she's unpopular...her name is Wilma!,"Honestly, we have seen this plot far, far too often in literature. Wilma, an annoying young girl, is in the cool crowd once her wish from a fairy is granted...however, Wilma's acceptance has to end within three weeks...I was snoring by the second chapter. If you are a Levine fanatic, read it if you must (but don't buy it). If you aren't...then don't even waste time thinking about it. I loved her 'Ella Enchanted' and 'Dave at Night', but this book smacks of uninspired, hurried writing."
3,Mediocre young adult wish fulfillment story.,"Poor, lonely, loner Wilma gives an old woman her seat on the bus and is granted one wish: the be the most popular girl in school. Suddenly, the prettiest and most popular girls are her best friends and she's got dates for the big dance. But the boy she really wants to go with his the dorky poet with a unibrow. And suddenly, Wilma realizes that the spell will break once they all graduate in three weeks. While Levine captures a sensitive subject, she does so without any finesse or particular insight. The fairy tale aspect is just pure kid's wish fulfillment, with no twist or originality. Definitely not one of her stronger books. Grade: C"
4,The Wish,"The Wish takes place in modern day. It is about Wilma, a self-conscious girl, who is very smart but wants nothing more than to be popular. In true Carson spirit, Wilma stumbles across an old fairy. The fairy agrees to grant Wilma one wish. And Wilma wishes for popularity.This book is a wonderful perspective of the teenage girl and the difficulties she has. The characters are great, and so is the plot.I recommend this book to all girls."
5,"Funny, charming and insightful","This is a warm, delightful book with a great message, most gracefully delivered. For all Wilma's yearning for popularity, she has the sensitivity, good humor, and good sense to realize that a boyfriend who likes and appreciates you for who you are is a treasure. I enjoyed this book completely."
2,Too Much Kissing for 12-yr-olds,"A book intended for middle-school girls, but fairly shallow ones. Should we really write about middle-school girls who think popularity and boyfriends and kissing are the most important things in the world?A bit magical, as most of Levine's books are, this one is about an unpopular girl who has a wish granted by a fairy. Her wish -- to be the most popular girl in her middle school -- inevitably comes to an end when middle school ends, and she must go to high school. Will she still have friends? Will she still keep her boyfriend who kisses her on every street corner? Will she learn that she is a good person whether she is popular or not? A rather hackneyed plot, and not anywhere near as good a book as Ella Enchanted, or many of Gail Carson Levine's other books."
1,Not one of Levine's best...,"I love all of Gail Carson Levine's other books(too many to name), but this was not one of her best. It is the never ending plot of how a girl wants to be popular, but isn't, but she gets a wish and she becomes popular, then she realizes that being popular isn't all that important. This is such a cliched plot, it almost most made me sick. Even to the die hard fans(like me), I wouldn't reccommend it. If you have never seen this cliched plot, read it, but you probably have, so don't."
3,What Happened Gail!!!!!!,"It is a great and fun filling book if you're the popular type and just can't stop talking about yourself. It was so predictable and dorky. Who has every heard of a old lady that is a witch that rides the bus. Gail Carson Levine bases her book on modern time typical teenagers and brings in witches what connection is that!!!!! Other than that it was an okay book. I sort of knew when she wished to be popular that it was going to come true and she was going to have a boyfriend and a ton of friends. This book was just a smug, to an annoying degree. I don't want to say that I completely hated it but you got tired of it after a while. Some books you just don't want to put down, but trust me it was getting pretty tempting to put this one down. I rebuke this book because I think it could have been a lot better. Especially since her first book Ella Enchanted was so great. What happened Gail?!?!?!"
1,Not good,"I really like Levine's book Ella Enchanted. But I would not recommend The Wish for adults, let alone children. It is too vulgar."
1,BAD,"The book talks about how this girl has no friends and then an old lady grants her wish. It mainly talks about what it's like to be in highschool, middleschool and popularity."
1,I'm still waiting for this book!,"How can I possibly rate this item when I'm still waiting to receive it? Why don't you e-mail me again a couple of days after you've shipped it to me, and then I will give you some positive feedback."
4,The Wish,"HI. I thought the book THE WISH was a great book!!! It was so exciting, and I never knew what was going to happen next!! It was very funny, too. I loved all the characters in the book. It was about a girl named Wilma who made a simple wish to an old lady. Her wish was to be the most popular girl in her school. The next day when she went to school, Wilma was definitly the most popular girl in her school. All the popular girls were friends with her, and were nice to her too. Later, Wilma realizes that her wish to the old lady was to be the most popular girl at her school but Wilma is in the 8th grade graduating in 2 weeks!! Will Wilma be popular for life, or only for 2 more weeks?? You have to read the book to find out!! I think you will definitly like it! I know I did!"
3,Not What I Expected,"I loved _Ella Enchanted_ and expected _The Wish_ to be as amazing and entertaining. However, I felt as if I was plodding through the reading at times, just trying to get through the text. Though the wish to be popular is something kids can relate to, I think that the book seemed a little preachy and the big fat moral lesson hung a bit too heavy, impeding the pleasure factor."
4,THE WISH,"A girl named Wilma Strurz was a very unpopular kid at school. At least that's what she thought until she meet an old lady on the subway. The old lady granted Wilma one wish. Wilma wished to be the most popular kid at school. Wilma had more friends than she could count and forty dates for the Grad Night Dance. Wilma finally realized that her popularity may not last forever. The thing I liked about this book was that it was exciting to read and what I didn't like was that this book was that it didn't make sense if you read it really fast. This book would be best for girls at the age of 13, if you read at a medium speed, and if you are into fantasies."
4,The Wish: An Enchanting Tale,"The Wish by Gail Carson Levine is an enchanting tale of a young pre-teen who yearns to have friends. Wilma has been totally ignored in her junior high school for a while. The only true friend Wilma has is her dog, Reggie. She is a charming and pretty young girl whose selfless nature earns her one wish. The wish she chooses is to be the most popular person at Claverford school. The book is about Wilma's experiences with her new found popularity. She has to make many crucial decisions and learn who she really is, and what she stands for. She also learns about the value of honesty, friendship, and true love. This book is a wonderful tale for junior high students (especially girls). There are characters and events that every student will be able to relate to. We highly recommend the book to teachers and to counselors. Although The Wish is fictional, it is highly entertaining and there are very valid issues that can be discussed within a junior high classroom."
3,"Enjoyable, but different then the rest of Levine's books.","I excepected another one of Gail Carson Levine's fantasy books, or maybe I expected a book that would create a different world to me. Though it was vivid and and colorful, and good, it didn't follow along the same lines as other books of her's. I don't regret reading this book, though, and I still recoment it to people. It was a bit hard to put down in ways, and I finished it in less then a day, but I do recomend it to any one."
4,REALLLLLLLY Good Book,"This was a really good book. I enjoyed it so much because I know that the girl, Wilma, shares a lot of the same feelings as many other girls. It was also extremely funny and interesting. When Wilma gives up her seat to an old woman, the old woman says that she can grant any wish for Wilma. I won't say much more, but if there were a morale to this story, I would say it is ""be careful what you wish for"". I recomended it to my cousin, and she really liked it also."
4,The Wish,"This book was recommended by a friend and me (along with a few of Gail Carson Levine's books) and i read this one last. I have to say, it was quite different from her others. While the others were about fairy's and princesses, this one was about an ordinary school girl who finds magic in an unsuspecting source.Recommended to all preteens."
3,A teen's dream!! (for some people((the dream not the book))),This book is about a girl named Wilma who feels very unliked(or unpopular). One she on a train and she meets an old lady!! This old lady tells she will grant Wilma a wish.So she wishes to be the most popular. And POOF!! Wilma is the most popular girl in school. She is in the popular group and she has 40 dates to a school dance! Will her wish last? to find out read this book!!
2,One of gail carson levines worst,"this book was nowhere near as good as gail's other books, but if you read this and dont like it, dont give up on her yet!!! ella enchanted was so good, i have rad it eight times, the princess tales are great for bedtime, and the two princesses of bammare is also amazing. i have not read her later books for younger childeren though, because they do not look as good. soon a new book called fairest is coming, so i hope she is getting back to her old ways. if you are a fan of gails better books, then i suggest you try reading shannon hales books."
5,"Realistic, yet fantasy","Wow...The first time I read this book, I was touched. Everybody wants to be popular, like the main character did, but have you met anybody who lent a seat to an elderly lady on a bus and gets a wish in return?Wilma, the main character, really matures throughout the book and makes you realize just how important it is to be accepted. This book really related to me and I'd be glad to read it again. It's a real page-turner!However, it's not very creative. ""Be Careful What You Wish For."" Heard that before? That's what Wilma learns too...sounds like Goosebumps, doesn't it?Again, even though it isn't creative, it's a fun, touching book and should capture your attention right away!"
5,The Wish,I purchased this book for my daughter...she absolutely loved it...Levine is one of her favorite authors...she has already it with great reviews.!
4,nice but one disgusting thing.......,"It is a very interesting book but I dont like the part with kissing. too much of that. You will love itand another thing. theres a moral. If you read it, you will know what the moral is.I hope this will be very useful to you, andREAD IT!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Just Good,"This book was just okay compared to Gail Carson Levaine's previous works. Set in modern times its about a girl named Wilma who is very unpopular. Wilma wishs she could be the most popular girl in her current school. Classic story, being popular wasn't that great yada yada yada you know the rest. What's different about this story is she only wishs she could be popular in her current school. When she graduates she's not popular anymore. In the end you never know if she keeps her popular friends, but she does keep her one eyebrowed new boyfriend. Read it but don't blame me when you're left hanging in the end."
3,The Wish,"This book was pretty okay. It's about a girl named Wilma who has her wish granted about being the most popular person at her school, Claverford. But she realizes that even though she has her newfound popularity, she will graduate and go to college in only 3 weeks. Will she be able to keep her new friends and boyfriend? What I didn't like about this book was that it was in modern times. I don't have anything agains books set in the modern times at all, its just I enjoyed her books with different time settings better than this one. But I guess if this book was set in the medival times, girls probably wouldn't be worrying about their popularity as much as they do now. An okay book, but I've read better."
1,Slippery and smelly,This mat is useless for yoga. I had another Aeromat that I loved. I was looking for a replacement but this mat is terrible. My hands were sliding all over the place. Later in the day I had the mat in the back of my car and my kids complained of the chemical smell it gave off. it is very strong. Complete waste of money.
5,Great guide to rediscovering a fascinating city!!,"Living in the Baltimore area for the past nine years, I thought I was somewhat familiar with the history of the city as well as most of the local sights. When I saw the full title of WISH YOU WERE HERE, this part intrigued me: ""A Guide to Baltimore City for Natives and Newcomers."" I'm actually neither, but I suppose I'd be considered more a newcomer than anything else...and this book has re-introduced Baltimore to me in a way that makes me enjoy and appreciate it's singular identity all the more. Written in a friendly yet informative tone, it reads almost like a letter from a friend who wants to share a beloved hometown with you. I highly recommend it to all ""natives and newcomers"" who want to know what makes Baltimore the unpretentious yet fascinating place that it is."
1,Desert Wind's World Dance,Not the best for dancability. The rhythm and the melodies don't seem to go together. I would not recommend it.
2,New Age Fusion at best,"I purchased this based on other reviews and I must say that I almost wish I didn't.I have to agree with the other reviewer, NOT very dancable. Maybe a veil piece here or there and a drum solo for a beginner dance class, but not for the intermediate or advanced dancer.It is new agey music with ME drum rhythms forced together.Maybe useful as background music at a hafla (party) when everyone is eating but not for when they want to dance.Just not for me."
1,terrible in comparison,"compared to Stew smiths book (The complete guide to navy seal fitness) this book is terrible. Lt. Smiths book explains more about BUD/S, has more exercises, has more explanations, and has a lot better programs and information. If you want to get a book about navy seal fitness requiring no weights, go get stew smiths book (i have em both)."
4,Inexpensive and effective.,"I purchase this book a few years ago (1998) and the results that one can obtain from performing the outlined routines are phenomenal. However, in order to perform the routines one must be in fairly good condition(i.e. 20 push-ups/5 pull-ups). Also, I would suggest that anyone interested in this program buy a three station gym.(pull-up/Dip/push-up)Most of the strength training is using your own body weight. Which is the most effective way to strength train, b/c of the higher NMA level.The strength and conditioning obtained through the program, if followed properly, is great!! I would advise anyone trying to get in shape for the summer or for the rest of their life, to try it."
3,A decent buy,"Mark De Lisle's Navy Seal Exercises is not a bad book at all; it gives you a basic idea of Navy Seal Training, including the innovative pull-up program. But the book suffers from its lack of depth. You get the feeling that you are only seeing a minimal outline of what the Seals do & what they are about. The book also lacks a sensible progression in terms of the exercises, sets, reps, and rest periods. If you try to perform the routines as listed, the majority of readers will fail or get hurt. A much better book is Stewart Smith's Compete Guide to Navy Seal Fitness. Smith's book provides a much more realistic and complete program - although some of the exercises are dangerous & he forgets to mention the appropriate rest periods."
4,An excellent addition to a comprehensive fitness program,"Mark De Lisle does a good job encompassing a broad range of Navy SEAL exercises, especially the pullups, pushups, and ab routines. This is not a program for the weak, however, as it is easy to get discouraged early on at the level of difficulty. (Start slowly, advance slowly.) I advise having a solid knowledge base of proper exercise dynamics because improper form could lead to injury. Also, some of the ab routine should be modified for us ""mere mortals"" due to the high risk for back injury if you follow his examples exactly. Although the program is very hard for me as a female, I have witnessed the sculpting and strength gains many of my male friends have attained by using this program."
4,No esta tan mal,"Tengo uno de estos libros y no esta mal para mantenerse en forma, cosa que no hago, ya que solos lo utilizo de vez en cuando para una que otra rutina de calentamiento, me parece que es un poco exigente la técnica pero parece funcionar, requiere mucha dedicación."
3,Navy SEAL workout,"This book is not exactly what I had been expecting but it is still a good guide... for a beginner I think. I'm going to buy stew Smith's book next, I heard it is pretty good."
3,good workouts,"There is a lot of good workouts in here that don't require a gym. However make sure you have a ""chin dip"" station where you can do pull ups and dips. If not you'll have to be creative and improvise."
2,Not Well Organized,"I bought the book a while back, and while the explanations of exercises and stretches are nice and simple, there is a complete lack of explanation in lay terms of how to actually USE this routine. E.g., In the Upper Body section, you have to read the fine print that says, ""do this Monday, Wednesday and Friday."" The same phrase is in plain print in the next section. No explanation of how you should integrate the cardio with the workout. THIS IS NOT THE WORKOUT FOR SOMEONE WHO ONLY HAS 1 or 2 HOURS A DAY TO EXERCISE! It seems DeLisle is just listing already-available information as briefly as possible, with no respect to the lay people who actually have to execute the program. (And true, the many shots of skinny guys are not extremely inspiring.) And contrary to other reviews here, no, there is NO phone number so you can call DeLisle. They're reviewing the WRONG book. If you want a program that actually explains the proper way to implement it, get ""Body For Life."""
3,Not the best you can get.,This book seems more interested in skinny guys running around topless than serious training. The models they use certainly don't inspire confidence in the program.Other books are better. Stew's book is great.
4,For getting in awesome shape.,"First off, I just want to clarify that all these people who say you won't be a Navy SEAL after reading this book are right. The only way to be a Navy SEAL is to go train with them. That said, this book is excellent for an ordinary person who wants to get in great shape. I am using it to train for rugby and the strength excersises are what I find most helpful. Using body weight has left me less sore than using dumbbells but a lot more tired. This program is primarily for building muscle endurance, though you will get stronger. I recommend it more for a high school/ college athlete as a supplement to whatever your coach has you do. This is NOT a book for someone who wants to try out for any kind of a Special Forces job."
3,good start,As a Marine I was looking for a overall improvement to Marine Corps PT programs.(Non-weight lifting combat fitness program.) I have known Navy Seals over the years and respect there ability. However this is a very basic guide to fitness. The upper body work outs are GTG. but I feel the combined work outs leave allot to be desired. Not for those already in great shape. Entry level fitness at best.
2,Save your money check it out at the library,"This book is not good. Let me tell you what you will find inside. RUN, DO PUSH UPS, DO PULL UPS and ABB Work that is it. There are some variations but it's not worth the money."
2,A waste of time,"This book is only for those who are serious about getting in shape and are willing to spend alot of time doing it.The exercises are good, but you'll need to spend two hours a day on just strength training.I followed the book for a little while,but I just couldn't keep it up.Who has time to do hundreds of reps of the same exercises every day?Take my advice.Stick to a simpler workouts and invest in some weights.You'll see the same results in a quarter of the time."
2,a waste,I was a Army Green Beret in Vietnam and to tell the truth this program is a waste all it does is tell you waht you can get off the internet for free and all you do is what an ex military or even a normal person would do to get in shape except tht it does not involve wieghts
4,A great character build-up book.,"This is what is referred to as a set-up novel in a series. There was a lot of attention paid to setting up Griffin's characters and it focused a lot on their personal lives. There were not as many actual battles as I've read in other books of this series. But I still enjoyed it. I like Griffin's characters, and it was good to get to know them and their ""signficant-others"" in this book. He has a lot of characters in his books, and it's sometimes difficult to keep everyone straight. Griffin is a really good storyteller, and I enjoy this series. The book occurs in various places of the United States from December 18, 1941 (after Pearl Harbour) until August 30, 1942. This is a time when the United States was not involved in the war in Europe, and they are just trying to get the measure of their Japanese enemies."
3,summer recruiting,"OK so it's not Tolstoy and also clearly is about as close to actual Marine life circa 1940 as Beijing is to San Diego, but hey sit back on the yacht (like Killer and his girl Ernie) and pour an inch of Famous Grouse and indulge. Everyone in the series gets drunk, laid and promoted, often at the same time. Priceless (now on book six, probably my last)."
5,This Book was Great,I'm a thirteen year old that like to read and this is one of the best sequals that I have ever read. Usually the first book is really good but the second one stinks. Not in this case I finished this book last week and started the third book which seems to be every bit as promising as this one. I highly suggest that you read this book even if you aren't that familiar with this era; after this book you will be.
5,Works very well!,My dog sheds so much!!!!!!!! She has patches of fur that come out of her. I couldn't even give her a bath or pet her without fur getting all over me. But I've been giving her this along with fish oil pills. And after about a week. The shedding has gotten so much better.
4,she sheds less,"though a bit crumbly, she loves them and sheds lots less than before. makes a good ""treat"" instead of those junks."
3,Nutri-Vet Shed Defense,It is comparable to other products sold in a pet store. I would rather buy these items at a pet shop.
3,MIXED BAG,"It was hard to choose the number of stars for this book! The information in it is incredibly diverse and provocative, but it is arranged poorly. The index really stinks if you're looking for anything other than a movie or television show name -- for example, if you want to check on some of the (non-actor) characters mentioned in its pages. And if you're not completely familiar with all the movies or shows mentioned, you're going to be lost.That said, the sheer range of material covered and the details given are encyclopedic. There could be more sources given for some of his allegations, but that's a lesser point. While it is in some places a difficult read, it is always interesting. I think this would make a good source book for someone who wants to look into this area further. But please, Mr. Rux -- if this is ever reprinted, work on that index! It's frustrating to KNOW you saw something on a subject several chapters ago, and not be able to find it in the index!"
5,Bruce Rux better than the rest,Very well researched. This book definitely brings up a lot of questions regarding the use of propaganda with UFO's. I enjoyed reading this book almost as much as Architects of the Underworld.
5,Excellent Fit and Finish,"This is my second Invicta Force. The first one, in sunray silver dial, I purchased 3 years ago for $300. When I saw that Amazon had this in penetrating deep blue for $159, I couldn't resist. I am not disappointed. The big 52 mm bezel, comfortable band, and excellent fit and finish serve this watch well. My wrists are 8 inches and are a good match for this size watch. If your wrists are smaller, you might want your watch to be in the 45mm bezel ballpark."
1,invicta watch,It is a very attractive watch but much to big to wear on my arm. Maybe it would be OK as a thigh band
4,Fresh And Crisp!,"This was Olivia Newton-John's first album, released by Festival Records in Australia (the same label that carried the early Bee Gees). It includes her international hit, ""If Not For You"" and is made up of cover songs, most notably, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Kris Kristofferson and Gordon Lightfoot.It is a sparse production, leaving most of the work to competant, if unremarkable studio musicians. However, it is a fresh voice, still untarnished and unbroken. Olivia's vocals here are wonderful and it's easy to see how this debut propelled her so easily into international mainstream pop music."
5,Really good,I really like this CD. Buy it! You won't regret it. Sum41 is really talented and really know how to play the guitar well.
2,Really overrated,"Sum 41 is average pop-punk if that. There is nothing really interesting or profound about them and they basically sound like clones of Blink 182, although not quite as repetitive. I bought this cd soon after it came out before they were on mtv and campus invasion tour and everything and I thought they might be better than Blink 182 and not completely sell out. I was wrong. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because it is an ok cd to snowboard to. But I will definately not buy the new cd. I borrowed it from a friend and it sounds exactly the same as this one and I don't need two cd's full of the same boring, predictable, sell out music."
1,Generic Rock - Not Punk Rock,"This band is horrible. All of you people praising this band are either a) under 16 years old or b) mindless morons. If it was real punk rock, it wouldn't be on mtv. Also, Blink 182 is basically a boy band."
3,Pretty Good....,What can I say...I LOVE Sum 41! I highly recommend picking up all their cd's. While this one certainly isn't my favorite...it's a keeper! :)
1,blah,I too did not care for this CD. Every song sounded the same and I found it to be boring. I guess this is what happens when you can get a cd for dirt cheap. I'm glad some people are enjoying it because I'm surely not.
3,a 12 year old from ct hey the other 12 year old im a female,um i didnt get the cd but there kool im goin to the ozzy fest my sn is willow83088 IM i love korn and im a female sk8er
1,err,erm.. well.... is this really worth a review? this is really really bad. just please... for the sake of rock music in the world.... dont buy it... please.... i beg you... dont soil your rock collection with this pile of worthless crap. dont soil your rock collection with all killer no filler either. thankfully sum 41 recently have redeemed themselves with does this look infected? and chuck. just please.. dont buy this.. hell dont even download it.... dont even BOTHER borrowing it off your mates.... kill it!!! kill it all!!! grrrrr!!!
2,Not real great,Sum 41's cd's are usually god but this one only had 2 or 3 good songs on it and thats including the intro... not even half as good as their album Chuck.
3,Not As Good As You'd Maybe Expect,"I must admit, If I wasnt a huge Sum 41 fan I would not be pleased at all with this disc. Its very short and has long dull instrumentals. THe only good songs are Makes No Difference and Machine Gun. Summers good too but its also on All Killer No Filler. The whole band seems to forget about even making this album. (Remember Deryck on MuchNews when he mentioned the followup to Does This Look Infected? a while back? He said that he wanted the new album to sound like a cross between All Killer No Filler and Does THis Look Infected. He didnt mention this disc. And of course, the whole band agrees that What We're All About should not have become a single) So, buy this for your collection if you're a Sum 41 fan. Dont expect any entertainment from it. ..."
5,i skate,"sum41 kicks i bought the cd the same day i first heard of them. I'm not really into punk,but i cant resist sum41"
1,Are These Talentless Rejects Still Around,"Sum 41 give it up you all suck, you cant sing, or pretty much do anything else.Another no talent band trying to be something they aren't and never will be...A GOOD BAND!!"
5,This is SICK. Period.,"Sum 41 has to be one of the most rad artists my ears have heard. Most of the time these kind of artists have no talent. But Sum can sing. Sum 41 is the next Blink 182 no question. This is definately a CD you can listen to over and over and it gets better every time. Do yourself a favor and go out and by Sum 41 ""Half Hour of Power""."
3,A couple of great songs and some bad ones....,"The songs ""Machine Gun"" and ""Makes No Difference"" are the stand outs. These 2 songs alone make it worth buying (in fact they are why I bought it.) I really can't get into the rest of the CD. ....Overall they have a good sound and its a decent CD. It's just that it isn't a good enough CD to make me take Nothing Gold Can Stay out of my CD player... It's not a CD I fell in love with, but I will listen to it every now and then. Another plus is that there are not cuss words. I have lots of respect for a band that does this. If you like pop punk you will enjoy this CD..."
4,Sinbad Likes........,"This is a great CD, so much better than All Killer No Filler. It has 3 instrumental songs, which are great, but i think it would be nice if it had more songs. All the songs are great, and fun to listen to, but its not the best CD, so i gave it 4 stars. I like all the songs, but these are probably my favorite: ""Makes No Difference"",""What I Believe"",""Machine Gun"",""Summer"", and ""Another Time Around"""
5,GREAT READ,"I found this book through a forum on a website named slowtrav.com while searching for vegetarian cuisine in Italy, this book was mentioned on the site so I decided to run out and purchase it. This book was fascinating and very well written."
5,A book you can trust!,"Having actually used this book as a restaurant guide for my last trip to Venice, I can confidently say that ""what you read is what you get."" All four of the recommended eateries we tried proved to be exactly as they were represented in Chow!Venice. This made our visit so much more enjoyable than previous trips, where we had to try and guess if a restaurant might be worthy or not.The authors are clearly people who love Venice, but maintain a critical eye (or mouth, as the case may be), when reviewing the subjects in this book. Brava to a book well written, and thank you especially for the clear, concise directions provided for reaching the many culinary delights of Venice. Cheryl Alexander, San Diego, California"
4,"Yes, buy this book and try the restaurants, but...","I brought this guide to Venice with me last time, and I'll bring it next time too. It's a good little book. The ladies point out some very nice restaurants. However, the anecdotes really suck. All they do is point out special treatment that they've received at one restaurant or another, and this is very unbecoming in what ought to be impartial criticism. I know how thrilling it is to be considered an insider in Venice, but the authors should show a little professionalism and keep it under their hats."
2,Sex And The Single Girl,This movie was better than I thought it would be because of Natalie Wood. Don't expect to see a great movie but a fun one.
4,Original Aspect Ratios!,"I wish these had been released as separate DVDs, but the most important thing is that this is the first time many of these films have been released on video in their original aspect ratios!Since Amazon's listing can only handle one aspect ratio, the films are presented as follows, and all are anamorphic presentations:Bombers B-52 - 2:35:1Cash McCall - 1.85:1Splendor in the Grass - 1.85:1Gypsy - 2.35:1Sex and the Single Girl - 1.85:1Inside Daisy Clover - 2.35:1Note that this is the first time Cash McCall has been seen in its original aspect ratio since its theatrical release; even Turner Classic Movies only has a pan & scan 1.33:1 copy."
5,Natalie Wood Collection,Nice to have movies of Natalie Wood that they don'tshow on t.v. anymore. Sex and the Sinlge Girl is avery good comedy she did with Tony Curtis who she alsostar with in The Great Race. I recommend this collectionto any Natalie Wood fan.
4,"Where's ""Love with the Proper Stranger?""","That was her very best performance, followed by ""Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice."""
3,Seriously!? Natalie Wood is worth a collection? Not with these films.,"Just bought this for $15 and thought it would be a steal. It is a great price for these six movies, but it bothers me that Warner Brothers would put together a Natalie Wood box set. She is no Myrna Loy. In fact, I don't find her to be that good of an actress. She cries a lot in these movies, but is that acting? I don't know. Gypsy was the reason I got this set and the other films to me seem like ""filler"". There are MANY other great and talented actresses that deserve a box set from Warner Brothers (Myrna Loy comes to mind) over this particular one. Maybe she is an aquired taste, not sure. Everyone else reviewing this set seems to like it (or her), but I am somewhat disappointed. Would prefer to see other actresses being showcased instead.Wonder if she were alive today, would she still be hailed as an icon? Or is she just another pretty face?"
2,Agree with 'where are the singles',"What is with Warner Bros Videos. I agree completely with ""Seen them All..."". I have been waiting for a release of 'Cash McCall' and 'Love With the Proper Stranger"" since they started releasing films in DVD. I am now hoping for a Blu-Ray release, but will settle for any release in DVD."
5,Natalie Wood as I remembered her,Love this set.Never had seen a few of these oldies but they were all great.Just now realizing why people were so crazy about her
3,Not quite what they Said it was,The only frustration was it said the cutouts were there for the mirrors. It's marked for that model but doesn't have the cutouts.
3,cuts down on heat but looks dirty and moldy after a while,"This is my 3rd or 4th one of these. They get ugly black and brown moldy looking spots inside, so I end up throwing them away. I've tried many things to clean off the spots. I have a 2000 Chevy chassis under my motorhome, with the side mirrors that require the cutouts. That model of windshield bonnet is no longer available in a big enough size, so this model is a very tight fit and has to be cut to fit over the mirrors. On the plus side, which is why it gets three stars, the RV cab area temp is lowered about 10 to 15 degrees with one of these on the windshield. Helps the air conditioner a lot."
1,Item didn't fit,I ordered the size it said to order for a 95 Chevy Van. It does not fit. It is too narrow across the windshield and the openings it has for the mirrors don't come anywhere near where my mirrors are located. Now I have no idea which size to order. I will be returning but would re order if I had any idea which size to order because the item appears to be well made.
2,product needs some work,"Product came in short order. Fit however is a bit of a problem. First there were no cutouts for the mirrors. This made the cover ride high on the windshield. Not sure if the little diagonal strap in the corner that fits over the door is the security strap but if it is that doesn't provide much security. Also, due to the way the cover bunches over the windshield and mirrors the magnets in the lower corners don't provide much security. Instead the magnets are more like a ""rock in a sock"" beating the finish or smacking the window if there is more than a light breeze. While I haven't made any cuts to accomodate the mirror mounts I think it would be a much better fit and a better product with the cutouts. I also noticed that while the upper corners are supposed to fit over the doors of the MH, if the door is open more than an inch or two then the cover will not reach to install. I had to barely open the door and pull like heck to get the corner strap over the door corner."
1,Trash!,"This thing is junk! Don't get it.Normally I'm not a naysayer, but this is too much. I only used it for a month or so, and had nothing but problems.The TX *and* T5 do not fit properly, they rattle badly and could get damaged. I had to put my own padding inside because of this.The outside 'metal' has got to be plastic. After a week of very light usage, it looks like trash. Scratches and ugly gorges, and I hardly even used it.After using it about a month, the plastic latch broke right off. Now it won't even stay shut.I advise you to look elsewhere. This thing is no good!"
3,The rest of the story,"I thought, for the price, this would be a metal case. It's plastic but so far it's working ok. I am hoping that the clip that holds the Palm in the case lasts. It is made of plastic too.I like the SD card holders.It took me a week or so to realize that the case can be locked shut. I kept a rubber band around it until I sat on it one day and heard a click. Turns out you have to apply pressure on the case to lock it shut. This isn't real obvious and there is no documentation showing this.Anyway, it works and I'm fairly happy with it. Shipping was prompt and I was kept up to date on things."
1,Junky case for Palm,"My Palm TX did not fit well inside this case, it rattled around. A LOT! There is no cushion supplied inside the aluminum case. I ended up taping a pice of bubble mailer to the inside of the case to keep my device cushioned and still. This helped a lot. I had the case for a few weeks when I dropped it (while open no less!!). I must admit the Palm T|X survived the fall, I attribute this to the bubble mailer inside the back of the case! However the case itself bit the dust. The cheap plastic strip that slides ito the groove on the Palm device to hold the Palm inside the case, well it broke clean off upon being dropped.Also there are NO speaker holes, if you want to hear alarms you better have the case open. No access for charging while case is closed, no access to SD slot without lifting Palm device from case. All in all a poor case for your T|X or any of the T series Palms."
3,Palm T5 Hard Case: So-so,"I have the new Palm T5 and the hard case from Palm. It is a little big for the T5 and so it rattles if you carry the case in your jacket pocket ( I am a physician and so I carry it in my lab coat pocket). The latch on the case is plastic and is difficult to fasten and looks like it will wear out with time. The two clips inside for storing your digital media cards are too big for the cards supplied by Palm and so they do not stay in place. Overall, a poor product for my use."
1,Crap!,"This is probably the worst case sold by Palm. It has no access to any ports, buttons, stylus, etc., so every time you wanna use the T5 you have to take it out of the case. It is way too big. And finally, the hinge can rub against the unit!And $40???No wonder Palm has been giving them away for free with purchase... I miss the old Palm high-quality cases, such as Palm V, etc."
1,"Too big for the item it's supposed to protect, and the latch breaks too easily","A few years back I had a Palm m515 and Palm's hard case for that model PDA and I loved them both. The hard case was well-made and fit the PDA snugly, protecting the PDA quite well from bumps and the occasional drop.The latest incarnation of Palm's hard case is something of a disaster. It's a bit too large for my TX, so the PDA rattles around inside the case when I carry it in my pocket -- the PDA's case is scuffed in a few spots because of the rattling. In addition, the latch on the hard case is plastic and after a little over two months' use, it's already broken. I now have a hard case that won't click shut and flaps open at the slightest provocation, offering no protection for the PDA at all.I got the hard case at no charge as part of a promotion when I bought the TX and I would never consider buying the product at any price."
1,The little plastic catch broke in less than a month,"I purchased the case along with my new Palm TX to protect it on trips or whenever carrying it. It's a metal shell with a molded plastic liner. The little plastic catch in the lid half, which keeps the case closed, never seemed to work quite correctly, requiring several sliding motions before it would click shut. On a trip on March 3rd, this very small lip of plastic molded into the case broke away. Now it has no catch to keep it closed. Since the case cost me about $24 new and I'd only get about half price for the return, I figure the broken little catch costs me too much to return. I'll use a rubber band around the case, reminding me how flimsy and insufficient the case closing mechanism is. Save your money and don't buy this case. I don't remember reading the reviews before I ordered it -- so there's a $24 lesson!"
1,Sucks hard,"Latch breaks easily (e.g. first time it fell out of my backpack). Tungsten flops around inside. Hard to hotsync, access ports or stylus, or press the power button without lifting palm out of case. In short, it sucks! I'm buying the Innopocket Deluxe Metal Case. I'll try to write back with a review on that one. Meantime, avoid this one at all costs. Bad reviews follow it everywhere it goes."
2,How do you open it?,"So far, I'm not too happy with it!I just got my hard case and as sad as this is, I can't figure out how to open it! Help!"
2,Latch Broke After a Few Weeks' Use,"The case seemed to work ok once I figured out how to open and close it properly, but the latch broke after not much use. (To open, you have to slide the top forward--shear it--before opening it like a book.) The case is bulky, so I didn't use it unless I needed the extra protection. I do not recommend this product."
1,DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY ON THIS,This case dose not fit the Tungstem T5 properly and does not close right when the unit is in it. The case also will not lock and the PDA falls out when it is in the case. PLAM ONE PLEASE DO SOME Q&A BEOFORE YOU PUT SOMETHING ON THE MARKET
1,Hard case doesn't deliver on protection,"T5 does not fit securely in case (rattles).Was dissapointed that the catch mechanism to keep the hardcase closed is nothing but a tiny tab of plastic. The case pops open even from a slight drop (this may save your T5 from initial impact, but not from the follow-up bounce or skid). After the weak plastic tab that keeps the case closed breaks off (which it will), the product is just a flappy clamshell."
5,Awesome Case for T5,"I bought the palm case before I saw this one, which I purchased as well, and the case listed here is 10 times better. It has a screw on/off belt clip which is nice when you do not want to put it on your belt, there is no clip hanging on the side of the metal. It also allows access to the stylus without having to pull the T5 out, as well as you can turn the T5 on and off the same way. Great product!!!!!!!!"
2,Jill,The case scratches too easily. The clasp is difficult to open and close as it is not aligned properly.
1,"broken latch, poor hinge design","As others have reported, my latch broke as well, but I broke it within three days of ownership. Within a month, I cracked the bit of plastic that is supposed to hold the palm in place when I was removing it from the case to sync it. At the time, the case had so many gashes and dings that it really looked unpresentable. Bought a Rhinoskin to replace this. Look elsewhere before you purchase this one."
2,look somewhere else for a case,"The case is bulkier than expected, but offers good protection.The palm rattles a bit inside when the case is closed (a little annoying).The card slots inside the front cover were too tight to use for fear of ruining the cards.The plastic latch that keeps the case closed wore out in a couple of months (case was opened twice a day on average).I wouldn't buy this again."
1,Junk,"Marginally better than dropping your PDA on the floor, I guess. But only marginally - the Palm rattles around so badly that any major bump will damage it anyway. The latch is easily broken (mine took about 5 weeks to go) and can easily fall open anyway, and there is no access to any of the ports, so if you want to put this in your pocket and listen to music, you're out of luck.This is an appallingly bad design, and I wouldn't use one if it came for free (which mine did)."
1,Problems,"OK, so it protects the TX on a fall, however the latching mechanism depends on a thin piece of plastic that eventually breaks, rendering the case without anyway of remaining shut on its own.Replacing this with something like the BoxWave.com hardcase, availab le from Amazon."
1,Card holders can damage your T5 screen,"I tried checking how far away the memory card holders are from the screen, and came to a conclusion: one hard knock on the case when the case is closed and your T5 lcd will need to be replaced. If you did take advantage of Palm's promo - got the case free, my recommendation would be to cut/file off the card holders. Better safe than sorry."
1,"Poor quality, latch broke, rattles","Bulky, rattles (loud) in your pocket, and now it won't even close as the tiny plastic latch snapped after very light use for several months. Just a really poor design for fit, latch, and usability. So awkward to use (can't reach the stylus or power button), it makes me not want to use my TX."
1,The small tab broke,"I have had this case for about 4 months now. The first thing I noticed was the Tungsten T5 does fit snugly in the case; what I mean is the PDA will keep moving back and forth inside the case while you carry it in your pocket, making a ""clacking"" noise. This is due to the improper fit. I circumvented this but sticking a small piece of sponge on one of the card holder tabs.After using the case for one month the weak tab used as a latch to close the case, broke. I somehow managed to stick it back with super glue but it lasted only for a couple of weeks. It is a waste of time trying to fix it.I carry the T5 as it is with the original flip cover that it came with. If you are still considering buying the Hard Case, I hope you have better luck than me."
5,Superb,The depth and revelations had me riveted to every page. One of the best books I have read in the last ten years.
4,"Interesting, honest and a bull's eye!","I was interested in reading this book since no one my husband or I personally know have any perspicacity regarding themselves, others or the culture. I know what Mr. Edwards has accomplished, because I went through ""the transformation"" and now enjoy happiness and an authentic life. I have learned how to deal with the system & the automatons in it which in itself is a subject worthy of writing about. Now instead of stressful, It has become merely routine. The point is to become independent, develop critical reasoning skills, and have the freedom to develop all your human powers that have been repressed because of the killers of social control and conformity. Mr. Edwards is on the right track. Take the time to read the book and think about what he is really saying. Good luck to you. You can do it."
1,Overly idealistic and paranoid,"When I first started reading ""Burning All Illusions"" I went into it with an open mind. As I continued my pursuit of ""freedom"" I was more than annoyed to find yet another book that does nothing but complain about the government and the media. I seems that the media has become the great modern scapegoat, always blamed when there is a problem in society that no one wants to tackle head on. ""Burning All Illusions"" is no exception to this trend. If there is a social problem from poverty to alienation, it is the government or the media who are at fault, not the public. Any solutions to Edwards alleged grievances are overly idealistic and unable to be implemented. I don't know why Edwards thought that the world needed another cliché commentary on modern society, but he has provided one."
4,Good tunes but mournful emphasis,"Why does Christy Moore have a propensity towards singing depressing tunes? Don't get me wrong, he is a master of the depressing and mournful tune. And, yet he can be really funny at times. But, where is the joy? Admittedly its much easier to pen a dirge than to write with heartfelt joy. Perhaps Christy needs to change his vision of life - he could start by listening to Bach and Mozart but I suspect that won't be enough to change the record as it appears embedded in a groove."
5,Real life everyday objects explained step by step how to create,"I remember watching The Woodwright's Shop years ago on PBS and loved the down-home style and approachable friendliness of the woodwright. When my son said he wanted to learn how to do woodworking with hand-tools, my first thought was to buy him books from the series. He was quite pleased to receive this and one other of the woodwright's books for Christmas."
3,More useful for an apprentice working WITH a master,"I like the book, I hope down the road it will be useful. But honestly I'm lost at some point in every project. I simply have no idea what he's saying or trying to accomplish. In some projects it's worse than others but all of them have some point where I'm hopelessly confused. At this point I have no confidence that I would be able to recreate any of the projects in the book.Now, I'm a beginner. Which is why I got a book for an ""apprentice"". Hopefully with more study and after I get some experience under my belt I'll be able to follow the text better or just see a way to go around the steps I find to be obscure.On the bright side there are a lot of REALLY interesting projects in here I'd really like to tackle. If you're looking for good ideas this would be a valuable resource. But I think it's a better book for a journeyman than an apprentice."
2,Oh no...,"This is a recap of some of the less than useful items Mr. Underhill has built on his TV program. I regret having bought it. I guess if you had never seen his show it might be considered interesting. Sorry, Roy..."
2,Not a CD+G,"This collection is basically composed of instumental versions of songs. It has a few lines of the song performed scattered throughout. It has a good variation of songs, but it is not a CD+G."
4,"Great Mix of Smooth Jazz, Electronica and World Music","It took a couple of listens, but I really enjoy the new Prafulrelease ""Pyramid In Your Backyard"". It is a nice mix of SmoothJazz and Electronica, along with elements of World Music withIndian and Brazilian overtones. The vocals are nice, especially""Eternity"" and ""Naked"". This CD will not be for everyone, butif you are looking for a nice blend of interesting music, Iwould recommend it."
4,jcanoe in N. O.,"Enjoyed this album. I would give 5 stars to the previous Praful album ""One Day Deep"", which is even better."
2,Praful - Pyramid in Your Backyard,"Praful's second album, PYRAMID IN YOUR BACKYARD, doesn't start off auspiciously... ""Moon Glide"" has a bit too much lite-jazz flavor that I'd like. But the pseudo-Indo-ethnic beats ""Says Kabir"" help wipe that out of the memory banks (though it present its own set of problems). ""Acredite"" gets back to the Brazilian vibe that marked his first album, and ""Eternity"" is sufficiently pretty to grace lounges across the world. ""Naked"" continues the mellow vibe, though Praful's vocals and lyrics aren't the strongest. The horns in ""Drop to the Ocean"" are quite nice, as are the stop-start guitars on ""Wishful Walk,"" but I'm not sure it's enough to overcome a certain blandness, endemic to the album, that overtakes both tracks. The closing track, ""We Live On,"" is good, but it's not quite enough."
2,Confusing and depressing read,"First the good: The author is definitiely a gifted writer. She is able to paint a vivid picture of her characters and settings. The tone of the book is dark by design. Having said that, the book is overly depressing, and fairly predictable. I also found the jumping from character to charater in the first person often confusing. You often had to read several paragraphs into the chapter to figure out in who's head you were. Add to that the jumping forward and backwards in time is frustrating. Some chapters are told from the current perspective of a dead person.Towards the end of the book it really starts to drag. It almost began to appear that she was trying to meet some committed page count. The story really goes no-where. However, if you live or lived in Northern Wisconsin, you might find some of the local color interesting.Note to the author: Tree stands for hunting deer in Wisconsin were illegal during the time period in which your story occurs."
4,Reminding Us of War's Domino Effect,"Although it moves slowly at times, overall, this is a good book. Ellis explores the devastating domino effect war has on those who fight, those who wait for their fighters to return, those who are on the periphery quietly observing lives torn apart by man's need to kill.There is a definite bleak element to the setting. Yet Ellis tempers much of the cold climate and the dark days by having her characters find various kinds of beauty in their surroundings. It is how they manage to survive on hard-scrabble farms and in nightmare marriages. Her people are thoroughly believable.This story will make you cry at times, but always it reminds how tough and adaptable is the human spirit.We await her next novel!"
1,A terribly stupid book,"Don't waste your time with this book. Klein was a pampered brat growing up in an affluent society and her guilt trip led her to write a book that would normally have died a quick death if it weren't for the fact that left has gotten hold of her as their poster girl.The arguments are weak and the book, though entertaining at times, reads like something a high school student, hoping to impress her teacher, would have written.Don't buy it."
2,This is not the soundtrack to the movie of the same title.,"This is not the soundtrack to the the movie ""Once Upon a Time in the West"". It is a collection of ""western"" tunes (like the theme from Bonanza) which includes two selections from the movie. In addition, these are not the original Morricone recordings but rerecordings by a different orchestra."
1,Beware if you're not running Windows or Mac OSX 10.1+,"Amazon's not-so-complete product description fails to mention that this printer does NOT support PCL6, PCL5e or PostScript (all public-domain printer languages for which drivers are commonly available for almost any Operating System -- including Linux), but rather HP's new (and proprietary) ""HP JetReady 4.2"" Page Definition Language.The bottom line is that while this printer is likely just fine for users of Windows (98, Me, XP, Server 2003) or Mac OSX 10.1 or higher, users of other operating systems (Linux, for instance) are out of luck.HP recommends that users requiring a full-featured printer (which DOES support all of the traditional printer languages) opt for the Color LaserJet 3800 series -- which is around $300 additional."
5,"Inspirational and Healing, great music!!","Her works capture so many styles musically. She is very gifted and her songs bring out every emotion. You can't get bored listening to this CD. Each song is unique and has a message about the world, its diversity, and the people that transform and help shape ourselves as individuals. Don't miss this one!"
5,Tu Decision!,"This is the best album, to date, in Ana's career. She has trully earned her tittle as ""La Reina Grupera!"" Her own songs reflect some of her past experiences and she's been through some tough stuff. Her last single, ""Quise Olvidar"" is a great ballad that will mark her as a great music writter! This album also includes a song from a movie Todo Contigo, which was never realeased. That is also the web address to my site: Ana Barbara: TodoContigo.com"
4,Amber Pendant,Nice size. My wife was very happy to receive this item as a gift. The only downside was the sterling silver appeared a bit tarnished / dull to when delivered.
1,No recourse if pump goes bad after 30 days.,This fuel pump has a 12month warranty from AC Delco. Only problem is nobody will replace it if you buy it from Amazon. I bought one and it went bad after 6 weeks. So I am out $90.00 buying this item from Amazon. I would recommend buying one from your local auto parts store because they will replace it if it goes bad. Bosch has a lifetime warranty on fuel pumps.
5,Enough with the Conspiracies,"""The Grail Code"" by Mike Aquilina and Christopher Bailey is an excellent introduction to the medieval grail legends, tracing their development from Joseph of Arimathea to King Arthur to the Nazis. It refers only in passing to the various conspiracy theories (particularly the one associated with ""The DaVinci Code""). It will whet your appetite for Walter Map and give you a good framework in which to read Tennyson and Malory. And, more importantly, it will point you to the true nature of the quest: the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. If you are bored with conspiracy theories yet find the Grail legends compelling this book is a good place to start your quest."
5,A great read,I really enjoyed this book. I was inspired by Taylor's life. The book is well written and informative. Men like Judson inspire me to live for Christ even more.
5,Hudson Taylor's Spiritual Secret (Moody Classics),"I really enjoyed reading this book and experiencing his walk with the Lord in his life and ministry. He didn't sugar coat his Christrian life, he told it as a saved sinner that came to the saving knowledge and truth through Jesus Christi the Lord."
3,Average,"I unfortunately thought that a copy of the book would accompany the discs. Only the discs where included for the price which was a little disappointing. I had hoped to be able to visually follow along with the discs and this was not an option with my purchase, but this was my error for not ensuring that a book was included."
5,Thoughts on Hudson Taylor,This is a great read for anyone intersted in seeing what the life of a reasonably modern day saint looks like. It gives flesh to the passage in Matthew about seeking first the Kingdom of God.
4,Chose Hudson for Son's Name,"This book is an inspiring story of Hudson Taylor's life - the sacrifices he made of himself and his family to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. He was truly a faith-filled man, and his story will encourage your faith too! (We named our son Hudson after this Christian man.)"
5,Loved it!,"I had been looking for some horror anime. Im a fan of horror manga and I really liked Junji Ito's works. I typed in ""horror anime"" and this came up. Sounded interesting and checked out some of the reviews. I decided to get it and watched it when it came in. Really really liked it a lot. Love count D and his words of wisdom lol. Unfortunately it is only the 4 eps but now I'm gonna get the manga. Hopefully they release more eps on DVD. This is definitely a favorite or mine!"
4,A detailed analysis of a little known period of history,"Bracewell's book chronicles the rise and fall of the Uskoks and their (largely unrecognized) role in the shaping of modern Europe. The book is enlightening in its depiction of the Uskok ""pirates"" of the Adriatic ( from Senj in Croatia) as the last bastion between Islam and Christianity. The Ottoman Empire extended to the South of of the Uskok enclave of Senj. This frontier (in modern Croatia) is where the Ottomans, the Austro-Hungarians and the Venetians converged, all with their own agendas. The result is a engrossing history lesson in in war, peace, diplomacy, religion, negotiation, political deals and merchant trade. Bracewell's book analyses the customs and culture of the Uskoks as well as their battle against not only the Ottoman Empire, but also Venice and eventually (their ally) Austria. A stimulating, well annotated, but not light read."
2,Nice output duplexing is poor,"I like the output from it and the networking is very nice, but the back side of prints are offset about .5 inches from the front side. HP's support was very bad (although they did send me a new duplexer eventually which still did not solve my problem). After awhile I gave up on trying to get it fixed. All and all I wish I had purchased something else because duplexing is the only reason I got this printer. For someone who does not care that much about the duplexing option, I am sure it would be fine though."
3,Nice cover but....,"I bought this CD primarily because of its ver original cover art, regarding the music, I chose 6 songs to put in my iPod Thunderstruck, dirty Deeds Rock and Roll singer, Back in Black, Riff Raff and Down payment blues. I like to listen to different versions of the same song, and those were quite good but not excellent, they got good rythm and are well performed. If you like to have alternative versions of the same song this CD will rpovide you with some goog ones"
2,Don't bother,"Supersuckers do quite a good cover of RNR singer, and Zeke sound good on Downpayment blues, high voltage is decent. But the rest of this album.... *cringe* it's like a collection of the most talentless bands come together to make this album.3 good songs out of 12, you do the math.1. Beating Around the Bush * (lay off the harmonics)2. Back in Black ** (too tinny, then like a rocky Horror wanna be singing it)3. High Voltage *** (decent)4. Rocker * (vocals ruin it)5. Whole Lotta Rosie - ** Heyseed Dixie intro to a punk version.6. Downpayment Blues ***** (decent cover)7. Big Balls - *shudders, way to murder a song*8. Dog Eat Dog - *(vocals kill it)9. Dirty Deeds * (take band lessons, and get in time with each other)10. Rock and Roll Singer *****(good cover)11. Girl's Got Rhythm ** (shudders)12. Riff Raff * lay off the overdrive and learn the song properly.13. Thunderstruck ** the song is murdered, sounds like a drunk playing the intro and tries to go rob zombie voice over samples."
1,They don't let you sample the songs for a good reason...,"No way they'd let us sample this one. It is so bad it is laughable. 1-cent would be too much to pay for it.Hell would be a GREAT place to be compared to listening to this abomination.Glad I didn't fork over a dime--or anything--for this.I might pay NOT to have to listen to it.Yes, it really is that bad. It is laughable.Sure hits my top-5 all-time worst tribute CDs to AC/DC.Buy it if you have lots of cash to waste and need a good laugh."
5,Excellent Product,I was a little concerned after reading previous reviews. For the price it is a great piece of furniture. Plenty of storage with shelving in both cabinets. The only complaint I had was the directions to put it together was RIDICULOUS. It took me about 2 hours to put together. Just take your time and make sure everything lines up. Good luck.
3,"""Less"" for the money","THE SIXTIES: GROOVY HITS is an all-too-brief sampling of that great decade's fine music.This album contains 10 vintage original 60's tracks, and runs less than a half-hour. CD technology allows 74 minutes of music-- thus my only complaint with this package.In order to reach a certain price point, CD and tape manufacturers try to sell you one-third the music for half the price of a collection that contains 25 or 30 songs. It's not a trade-off that favors the consumer.Note that track #10 here is NOT Tommy Roe's ""Dizzy."" It's actually ""Twist & Shout"" by the Isley Bros."
1,Many releases of the same or similar tracks. These are re-records,"It states right on the CD that these tracks are 'new stereo re-records by one or more of the original artist or group. Groups may not have all the original members',And yes the tracks listed here are not the actual track on disc. After ripping and listening I found three (3) separate tracks listed here that were incorrect.But why split hairs of which tracks are offered...Re-records trumps everything.Walk away, save your money."
2,Jonestown meets Jainism,"Filmed at the height of the free love era, this film does not give any authenticity to Jainism, which is unfortunate. It makes it look like a joke and a cult like Jonestown. Jainism is a 3000 yr old religion that practices ahimsa, non-violence. I don't practice Ahimsa so I wanted to smack these people."
4,Waterproofed but with an odor,"Pack has nice proportions for a day pack but the waterproofing has left it with an unpleasant odor which days of airing in the sun has not mitigated much. Otherwise, no complaints and as I needed a waterproof pack, this should serve its intended purpose."
5,Nice Day Pack!,This is an excellent small backpack for day trips. Lots of pockets for my geocaching paraphernalia and camera. The large pocket works for my netbook or other larger objects. Well-padded straps. We used this on our recent vacation where we were doing some hiking...worked great!
3,ok,"It's OK for the price....seller shipped me a knife instead of the pack and it took quite a while to sort out...finally got the product.Good for kids, etc"
5,Fabulous crackers,"We make almost everything in our cafe from scratch, and we love these excellent crackers to fill in on occasion. The flavor is great, they are a great size and the price is an excellent value."
1,The Climate - a Perspective Unvisited,"Save your money and borrow this work from the library. if they're foolish enough to buy it! ... Is this book an example of the ""hiphopization"" or ""gangstazation"" of socio/anthropological literature? The efforts of the author may be sincere. Her premise may be correct. However, the work itself is academically and scientifically weak - The Discovery Channel was one of the few sources referenced! The text is redundant and vapid. The editing(if there was any)was [horrible]. I couldn't finish the book (Lord knows I tried) because of the spelling errors, fractured syntax and the proliferation of grammatical errors. As a descendant of the Afrikan Diaspora, I find it ironic that this type of work gets published when there are more deserving works out there begging for publication. Seek out the works of true scholars like Mazrui, Diop, Woodson, Van Sertema, etc. Sorry Pearl Jr., try again after you've polished your skills."
5,The Closer You Get,The Closer You Get- the harder it is to see the things that are staring you in the face- as the boys in this small Irish village find out. No matter where you live- you can relate to what the people of this small village feel (and do). The humor in this movie is light and refreshing. The music is just as fun (I recommend the soundtrack as well). This movie ranks up in my top 10 of the year.
3,Book Review,"Pipes gives an extremely detailed account of the early stages of Soviet Russia. The book is classic Pipes, who provides a wealth of knowledge but at times gives the reader more information that is probably desired. In my opinion, Pipes concentrated too much on the Civil War but that is the time period of the book. Despite that the book is still extremely informative and for the most part entertaining for true history readers."
1,Stories that sell... who cares about reality?,"""China Walks"" provides a distorted perspective on the state of modern China and lives of Chinese people through colored glasses of two rather typical professional journalists. While the authors acknowledge that ""there was another side to China as well"" in both introduction and conclusion chapters, the majority of the book is devoted to horror stories and negative anecdotes. Although many of the stories may well be true and news worthy, the book as a whole does not provide a balanced, realistic view of today's China.Imagine a book about the United States that devotes 25% of its pages to describe murders, 20% to the homeless, 15% to drug trafficking, 15% to single-parent families, 10% to White House scandals, 10% to greedy business people, and 5% to the unprecedented prosperity of the last nine years. ""China Wakes"" is the China version of such a book."
5,Great book if you want to understand China,"If you are planning a trip to China or want to get a deeper understanding of China, I strongly recommend this book. The book is written by this smart married couple. Every other chapter is written by each one of them. They both give the reader a well-balanced and analytical look at modern China. Some say the book is out-dated but I think a lot of it still applies to current China and if you want to understand this country then it is important to understand those critical years in Chinese history that Kristoff and Wudunn write about.I read several books before embarking on my trip to China. My wife and I both agreed that this was the most educational and interesting of all the non-fiction books.For fiction, I recommend books by Ha Jin."
5,AWESOME GUIDE,"I bought this book and WOW, it totally helped me take care of my hermit crab Sidney. It tells you all that you need to know to let your hermit crab live safely and happily ever after!"
3,"Okay book, but there are better out there","I purchased this book at the recommendation of Hank after I called the BAM in late 2011. While its not a bad book, it simply is not as helpful as others out there. The Strategy of Satan by Warren Wiersbe is much more helpful, and more scholarly. Also The Serpent of Paradise by Erwin Lutzer is a very very good exhaustive look at the character and plans of the devil Satan and spiritual warfare. Be warned that the Lutzer book is a seminary level work, so you need to be more focused when you read, and need to read it slowly. I do not agree with Hanegraaf on his view of the limitations of the devil and demons. According to Hanegraaf demons can not touch or physically harm anyone. Also according to Hanegraaf demons cannot appear as actual people to deceive others. Read the Erwin Lutzer book I mentioned and he completely disagrees with Hanegraaf and defends his arguments with far better scholarly research and Biblical exegesis."
3,"Some good info, but some misrepresentation...","Hanegraaff's book does contain a lot of good info, but it also contains some information that misrepresents the actual circumstances of situations. One example of this is addressed by the professor he misrepresents at Biola University. He has a web site explaining this at http: ...I personally disagree with Hanegraaff's views of how limited satan is over believers lives. Just as believers can yield themselves to sin, believers can yield themselves to demonic activity. I would recommend Three Crucial Questions about Spiritual Warfare by Clinton Arnold either instead of, or as a complement to this book."
4,enjoyable to watch,This was a pretty good movie that had some meaning behind it- was pretty accurate with the cliches in high school and showed both sides of the outkast and the popular girls life. He wasnt really an outkast but rebellious and it did accuratly portray the groups and how they compared them with sheep and it was pretty funny. The movie wasnt brilliant- it is somewhat forgetable but the story was ok to watch. Melissa John Heart plays a preppy girl who gives a makeover to the school's rebellious guy to transform him into a preppy kid to make his ex girlfriend and her ex boyfriend jealous.( the guy was cute to begin with but they just made him into a prep)- Then they end up together at the end and thats about it. Like i said its enjoyable to watch but forgetable- Only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it is accurate portrayal of some cliches in high school and how they act. I would rent it before you decide to buy it unless you see it for a cheap price.
4,A fun movie every time,"Ok, so it is a predictable high school movie, but we don't really watch these types of movies for the suspense of what will happen next. It is a feel good story with so many characters you can love. I find it entertaining every time I watch it."
1,Very poor Blu-ray transfer,"This review is about the blu-ray version of this fun 1999 film with the wonderful Melissa Joan Hart. It is really a ridiculously poor Blu-ray transfer with lots of noise and nowhere near full resolution. I have about 20 other blu-ray movies old and new, and comparison with any of them show how botched this is. Really, think twice before purchasing this blu-ray turkey."
4,Good Movie,"i liked Drive Me Crazy.I thought of it as a movie that I would not mind seeing over and over.Yes,the movie was predictable,but it was nice to see how the story unfolded.I would recomend this movie to someone who likes teenager movies."
3,A lark of Movie without thought,"This movie is lively and fun but not much too it. If you need a movie that requires just a little thought this the movie for you. Plot is normal, acting is good."
3,The Last Guy She Wants Is The Only Guy she Needs.,"That's the tagline to a movie that shows Melissa's diverse acting skills. Nicole Marris is a popular high school student trying to get her boyfriend to go to the Cennteinial with her. After she gets wind of the news that Brad doesn'twant her she cleans up her next door neighbor and once best friend to go to the dance. I won't tell what happens at the end but I will say Nicole's chacater gets better as the movie progresses. Three stars because:There is achol and drug use that was innaproriate.Language-rude but standableAnd the end! The best part. I'm saying, rent this before you buy it. It's a good movie, but you have to watch it at least twice."
3,It will drive you Crazy! [Peter O'Sullivan],"Actual Rating: * * 1/2 [out of 4] This film was a mix. It was a realistic potrayal of high school yet however it was to focused on the prom. I read the book based on this movie and I liked it much more. I feel as if the film shrugged off Todd Strassler's work and just focused on the main event. In the book the characters are so much more intelligent, in the movie Melissa Joan Hart just wears a bra around that shows cleavage to get boys attention for the centennial. Holding still, it's better than 'She's All That'"
3,Not the Best,"This movie was a big dissapointment to me. I had expected the acting to be better, and Melissa didn't look good throughout the entire movie. The ending was good, and there were a few funny parts, but it wasn't a movie that I'd buy, and I don't recommend you buying either, if you want to see it and haven't already, go rent it! If you still want to buy it then come back, but I don't think you should waste your money on this, you'll get sick of it after you watch it twice."
4,Good Movie,I loved this movie but would have preferred to see more of how this relationship developed and a better ending. I think the story was really good and I am sorry to see that it didn't do that great at the box office. I think you can learn a lot from these people and it was more real.
5,"One of the Quintessential 1990s ""High School"" Movies","There are a few films from the 90s and early 00s that just defined the ""High School"" film, and ""Drive Me Crazy"" is one of them. Good, fun film."
2,Disappointing.,"A 'very cute' story indeed. 'Drive Me Crazy' follows the story of Nicole (Melissa Joan Hart) who has just been dissed and dismissed by the high-school babe. So now she plans to win back her prom man by taking ugly loser Chase (Adrian Greiner) to centennial. Only to find out that she starts falling in love with them and bla, bla you know the rest. HO-HUM. Nothing big. Nothing great. Nothing exciting but something compared to 'Hanging Up' and some other movies."
2,Like all the rest...,"The movie was like most teen movies. In the movie, Melissa Joan Hart tries to get her next door neighbor to go to a dance with her to make both of their exes jealous. Not very original, huh?"
2,Disappointing.,"Although Melissa Joan Hart and Mary Susan Pratt do great acting jobs, this film does not yet reach it's fulkl standard. It is quite boring really and hardly has a story.So you reckon Drive Me Crazy is cute, funny, romantic and sexy? Sure it is! But that doesn't make it any good."
3,Ever since Clarissa....,"...Explained it all, I have been hooked to Melissa Joan Hart. I think she is talented and deserves what credit is due to her. I really hope to see her in much more. This movie was cute, cliche in some places. Well, it was basically, She's all That, Can't buy Me Love, Whatever it Takes..all any and very Teen movie that is coming out or is out. but that is ok. It is intersting to see how many times Hollywood can tell the same story. Really good movie. And Sabrina swears? Hee Hee, I wanted her to say the ""F"" word!"
3,A copycat?,"Sure this movie is cute and heartwarming, but it reminds me of another movie I've seen before. The plot seems to copy that of the movie Can't Buy Me Love which stars Patrick Dempsey. The popular girl gets into a bind and the guy (who happens to be an outsider) comes to the rescue. The result, two very opposite people falling for each other when that was not what they wanted."
4,Grenier and Hart make a great couple.,"I liked the movie very much and have seen it more than a couple of times. Grenier's work is icredible and he's acting is supreme. Although the movie has several errors, especially in the art direction i think it deserves 4 stars because it tries to be different from all of the teen movies."
4,"For Kids, This Book is Great!","At first my seven year-old son, a devout Captain Underpants fan, was doubtful as to whether or not to get this book. He saw the so-so ratings on Amazon and didn't think he was going to enjoy it. But upon purchasing a used version of the book, he found he loved all the activities included.Inside he found stickers, crossword puzzles, word finds, jokes, a comic: ""The Bride of Harry Potty,"" and step-by-step instructions on how to draw the Captain Underpants characters. It runs about 96 pages, but it's chock full of fun.Now, don't buy this expecting another Captain Underpants adventure; it's an activity book. If your child is looking for something to ease the wait for the next Captain Underpants book, give this a try."
5,good adventure,My son lives Captain Underpants. It is not the comics I grew up with or custom to but he loves it. If the books makes him want to read I say GOOD.
5,Great for boys,"We love Dav Pilkey and all his characters: Captain Underpants, the Dumb Bunnies, Ricky! They are fun to read and short enough to provide your kid a sense of accomplishment by finishing a chapter book."
1,used book,They sent me a used book with writing all inside and a page fell out and I paid for a new book!!! I was very disappointed and will never order from this seller again!!
5,My son loves these books,He has developed a passion for reading because of Captain Underpants! These books are perfect for a 1st or 2nd grader.
4,Kids love it,My kids love it - but then again they love all the captain's books! If you have kids I would recommend it
2,don't like classic re-recordings,"Half of the songs in this collection are the worst sounding possible. If the recording industry had any self respect they would make it absolutely clear on the playlist that they are re-recordings usually by some different group members, always by an artist that for whatever reason should no longer be attempting to sing. Every person who in good faith buys oldies classic music expects to recieve what they paid for, not some shabby re recording that sounds nothing like what they thought they were paying for. If the recording industry expects loyalty and honesty from the music buying persons, shouldnt they treat the music listeners with the same respect."
5,Fantastic addition to anyone's collection,"I was looking around my cd store, found this gem, thought the cover art was cool, and so bought it. On the way back from the store, I remember thinking, ""I shouldn't have bought that just for a cool cover...what a waste of money..."" Then I got home and gave it a spin on my stereo, just to see what it was like. Since that moment it's been my absolute favorite rap album. The most perfect mix of hip-hop I've ever heard...goes from hardcore and gangsta to just good. If there's a type of rap you like, I guarantee it's on this cd. Get it."
1,Nice Elevator Music,"Acid Jazz has pretty much come and gone and this CD can explain why. The genre just never attracted many real jazz musicians. Can this really music really be considered Jazz with an edge? Where is the Acid? For that matter, where is the Jazz? Easy-listening instrumental music with a beat track is what this is."
5,the word is...perfect,"Man o man, what a recording. Imagine if Danny Gatton had bumped into a crunchin' blues band on a dirt backroad, and whipped the whole ensemble into shape - this would be the result. Words fail in describing The Word...but I'll try: Fierce, soaring, groovy, wicked, sublime, crackling, homestyle cookin'."
1,"Souless, Tedious Noodling. Good for napping.","When did music sans structure or direction become so hip.At some point it loses all meaning and becomes mere musical masturbation.That's what this is. Not gospel, but some idiotic, lazy approximation by a bunch of people who are adored by hippies. The irony is so rich it gave me indigestion.However, it does make good background or elevator music, as long as the volume is kept pretty low.You hippies are pretty entertaining as long as I stay upwind from you and the volume on your noodle music is kept low enough to carry on conversations."
