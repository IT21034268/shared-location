4,"A little buggie, but good",Still has a few bugs to work out. But it works great. Great price for what you get.
2,Works fine but prevents Macs from sleeping,"As others have written, my iMac G5 won't sleep when this device is connected. It is a real pain to use as I need to connect/disconnect it every time. At least it works when connected to the USB port on my mac keyboard, so I don't have to reach behind the computer.Update : After contacting Griffin tech support, they mailed me a new unit which works fine.."
5,Another Exceptional Griffin Product,"Great product! I'm using Mac OS X 10.4.3 and all I had to do was install the software, plug it in, and it worked!The hold switch on the remote is a plus, and it works from my BASEMENT with the receiver plugged into my 2nd floor computer.And disregard the warning telling you not to plug it into a USB 1.1 port or an external USB hub or keyboard. Mine is plugged into my keyboard's USB 1.1 port and it still works just the same, with the same quality. Another exceptional product, Griffin!"
1,Air Click doesn't live up to the Griffin name...,"The range on this thing is horrible. I cannot even walk to the end of the hallway (less than 25feet, line of sight away from the Air Click unit which is on top of my monitor using its extension cable) and use this thing. 60 feet line of sight is a pipe dream. Do not get this if you plan on using it through-out your house, much less outside. We were looking for a good remote control to change music through our airport express while we were outside. This will not fit the bill."
5,Simple and effective device.,"This was an inexpensive item, so my expectations were hopeful but not all that high.Now that I have had a chance to use the AirClick I'm quite impressed. It was a breeze to install the software, and setup was a snap. To activate it for use with your program of choice you simply click on an icon in your system tray. It comes with an extention cord to put the dongle receiver in a spot of better reception if you need to. I find it works great simply plugged into my USB hub on a desk.I can control iTunes (only program I've tried) from all over the house- even through 3 walls at 50+ feet. The only clunkiness I see with it is closing out iTunes is a little funky unless you deselect the AirClick for use with that program before exiting (iTunes inquires whether another program requires it to stay open)- that is no biggie though.All in all I think the AirClick is a great product at a nice price."
2,Works well but is badly made,"I bought this at the end of Feb. 2006 for my Mac. It works well except for the fact that the device is poorly designed. The part where the USB connector is and where the device bends doesn't take the stresses of normal use well and keeps popping open. For a while I put it back together, but this last time it tore out four of the five wires that connect the USB to the rest of the device and it is kaput. The wires are thin and soldered on lightly. It is not a robust hardware design. That is too bad because except for that (serious) problem, the device worked well with iTunes, the DVD player and other software. I wrote to the tech support people at Griffin Technology and told them that they need to replace it because it broke under normal wear and tear. We'll see what happens. I will report back. But if you purchase this, be very very careful and treat it very very gently."
2,Not compatible with RF universal remote,"I have no idea if the thing works properly, but I thought I'd post the information I would have liked to have read before purchase: It's not compatible with the Harmony, Monster, or URC universal remote controls. Without that, it's of no use to me and represents 40 wasted dollars. If you have no such universal-remote need, then it might work for you."
1,Another useless piece of plastic,"I bought Airclick to control a new Mac Mini that we installed in a pantry closet with a monitor and speakers in our kitchen. The mini sit just behind the wall where the monitor is mounted, nothing unusual just two pieces of drywall that prevent the regular infrared mac remote from working. When it was brand new and just installed the Airclick worked marginally at best, you had to press, wait, press again, cross your fingers press again. I would say it worked about 40% of the time. After a couple months of frustration it has stopped working all together. It is a total waste of money and time as far as I'm concerned!"
1,Didn't work with powerpoint like it said.,Only gave directions for using with ipod. No help online when it didn't work with powerpoint. No help from the company itself. Sent it back and ordered from a different company.
1,Doesn't work...,"I opened up the AirClick and installed the software. The product was NOT functioning properly, so I rebooted. After that it worked as it was supposed to... until my computer was rebooted again. Now I cannot get the AirClick to work at all. I press the buttons, and the little red light blinks... but nothing ever happens... I hope I can get my money back."
3,Do not buy Kindle Edition,"The book is very well written, and is easy to read. The information here is great for everyone, not just social workers. My problem is not with the author, or the information.I bought the Kindle version of the book, and I have noticed there are sections missing, and passages just outright missing when compared to the print copy. Do not buy the Kindle version."
5,The Social Work Skills Workbook (with InfoTrac ),"Excelente Source, I highly recomend this book for those social work students who are learning to assess client needs."
2,wrong item,This item did not match my needs. It did not fit.I asked for a cap for a 2008 Jaguar and the information I received said that it was the right item. It was not.
3,Book of Tarts,"Book of Tarts: Form, Function, and Flavor at the City BakeryThe book has the food stains all over page 58, it likes the juice stain. The book was advertising that it is like new, no stain."
2,Maury pays slave wages,"This man only paid $200. To $260 a week salaryfor up to 80 hours a,week work . Anybody could do what he did on slave wages.Never paying a normal salary !"
1,Blind Faith is Dangerous.,"Hughes book is an excellent example of how blind faith works. For that reason I urge you to buy her book. Hughes twists the facts. For example, she quotes from secret tape recordings but doesn't tell her readers that she has taken sentences from several different pages of the transcript and strung them together in a single quote, thus altering their meaning. Hughes also omits key facts that she can't deal with. One example is that MJ took the Fifth Amendement in a 1994 lawsuit when asked under oath about his intimate relationships with little boys. Instead of believing the five star reviews of Hughes' book written by MJ fans, or believing the one star reveiws written by me and others, compare Hughes book with mine (also on Amazon), ""All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-up,"" and judge for yourself. What could be fairer than that?"
5,Excellent Book,"I always knew Michael was innocent of this child molestation charge. The media fueled the fire by not telling Michael's side of this story. Instead they just wanted to sell newspapers and tabloid lies. The lies are what sells newspapers not the truth. My hope is that one day. People will know the truth and finally clear Michael's reputation. I want the world to know what his fans and God always knew. Michael was a gentle kind man who would never ever hurt a child.Thank you Geraldine Hughes for writing this book. I do hope one day a movie or documentary of both ""Redemption"" and ""Conspiracy"" can be made.Michael Jackson deserves to have his reputation cleared once and for all."
5,Redemption: ((The Truth)),"This book is great, for sure this book has the information to prove his innocence. I recomend it to everybody, not just to fans. If you truly beleive in JUSTICE, and think everyone should have the right to a fair tria (GET IT) You'll be amazed what is inside the book.> Dates and files clearly show the plot of extotion> Michael was cornered in a wall, the only way out was to pay the money demanded> D.A office spent dozens of thousands of dollers, interviewd over 400 people, searched Neverland,his condo, and the family Encino home and could not find anything on Michael.This book is a MUST READ"
4,Tool is fine but not the one shown in the picture.,I just realized that the socket I received is not the one shown in the picture. The one I received steps down to a smaller diameter on the working end. That's no problem at all but I just thought I would mention it so someone thinking about buying this is aware of this. The tool would be slightly weaker than one that doesn't step down but this should be no issue in use. It appears to be very well-made and I have confidence that it will last virtually forever.
4,Still In Love...with this ring,"My husband and I purchased this ring as his wedding band. My husband spent a very long time picking out this ring and he still loves it after 5 years. We purchased the ring from the wonderful people at DiMarco Creations through Amazon. They were wonderful to work with and I will keep them in mind for my future jewelry purchases. The ring is very unique and many people comment on it. The setting is very squared on the sides so it does sometimes catch on things or scratch things if my husband is not paying attention, but this is something we expected due to the shape of the band. We have been very satisfied with the purchase of this ring."
4,Go cats Go,"I'm a late comer to the Rev. I was steered in their direction after being a big Social D. fan and seeing the recommendation for Horton Heat on their website. I bought ""Space Heater"" as my first album and despite its less than favorable reviews I liked it enough to buy all of their earlier albums. I just picked up ""Spend A Night In The Box"" and wasn't flipped, but after a few more times listening to the album its one of the CD's thats getting a lot of play from the pile on my desk. The Rev, Jimbo and Scott have fallen back on their original Rockabilly roots, so fans of their earlier stuff will like this album. Its also a good recomendation for Link Wray and Carl Perkins fans."
2,'Spend A Night In The Box',"I bought this based on Rusty Russell's 6/2000 Guitar Player mag review and am generally disppointed. My tastes and Russell's cerainly vary. Maybe The Rev must be seen live to be appreciated. Nice production by Paul Leary, several nice rockabilly songs, some laughable lyrics, some interesting guitar work behind the vocals but very ordinary solos. Brian Setzer fans will be disappointed."
3,Dissapointed.,"I found this Dvd to be very boring.I bought it in hopes to learn some blues riffs.I was bored because Rory talked too much and didnt play guitar enough.Im used to the lessons where riffs are played at regular speed and then slow with a short explanation then on to the next one,I didnt find that here.She teaches slide riffs which I might learn someday,for now ill stick with blues licks. Rory seems very talented but I recommened you find another source to teach you Blues Riffs...."
5,A once well known composer,"The music of Charles Martin Loeffler was often played in the United States and elsewhere until his death in 1935. Gradually his reputation faded. This is unfortunately a frequent phenomenon. It clearly also happened with Sibelius.The Music for Four Stringed Instruments is a great string quartet which uses Gregorian themes. It was written in memory of an aviator who died during World War I. It is one of the best American chamber works. The other two pieces are almost as good. This is one of Naxos' best CDs.Having given us a great recording of Loeffler's chamber works, hopefully Naxos will give us a recording of two of Loeffler's best orchestral works, Memories of My Childhood and La Bonne Chanson."
3,Repackaged Toshiba?,"In nearly all respects, this is a lesser version of the Toshiba M205 <ASIN:B0001MBJHK>. It uses a slower processor, ships with half the RAM, and has a smaller hard drive. Even the naming convention for the model seems inherited from Toshiba (Gateways' M275X opposed to Toshiba's M205). In this case, a bigger model number equals less tablet.I'm trying to see the innovation here. Maybe it's the Firewire port. It's not the SD-card support, since the Toshiba has that. Maybe it's the larger screen, 14"" opposed to the Toshiba's 12"". Could prove useful, but compelling?Weigh them each on their own merits, pick the best one for your needs, but keep in mind that if this in fact a re-branded Toshiba, you'll save yourself some technical headaches by going right to the source innovator. Better drivers, better access to advanced tech... maybe Gateway's technical support has gotten better over the years, but I doubt it.For a tablet PC, you can do better.Fred"
2,Tablet good Gateway bad,"Very cool computer and love the tablet style. I would advocate a tablet in general but not this one or any made by Gateway. It breaks easily, I have had to returned it and get it fixed three times, the hinges that make it swivel around are too weak for the weight so naturally they fall apart. And gateway's service is very very poor. There phone service is infuriating at times. I like the computer but will never deal with Gateway again."
1,It doesn't work well.,"Okay, no perfumey smell, but now my clothes usually come out smelling musty, and any other dirty odors remain. I'm very careful not to leave the load wet for long at all, dry it completely, but it still often smells worse after washing than before, and definitely, underarm odors and other body odors remain."
2,Good for piano solo not for acomponiment and not very accurate,"I was not very pleased with the book as with a lot of Hal Lenords books i have come across the vocal melody is in two places by it self and mixed in with the acomponiment. Having it mixed in with the acomponiment makes it difficult for people who would like to sing the song as they play it because you will have to remove it. I would not have had such a problem with this I it wasn't for the inaccurate writing the first song in the book ""your song"" if played while listening to the original sound nothing alike which would prove quite aggravating if your trying to practice elton johns piano playing techniques I will give it 2 stars because it does give you his key signatures and there is some accuracy but if I can find a better book this one will be on its way back"
4,"My opinion about Hal& Leonard's book ""Elton John""","It's quite a good book, just like the others I have from H&L.; The only thing bothering me is that the pages keep turning when I'm playing from it. Couldn't that be changed?But the music in it is just perfectly done!"
5,Very nice tools,These are well made screwdrivers. The heads are very precise and fit the various screw heads perfectly. The grips are very comfortable. I prefer to use hand screwdrivers vice powered to get a better feel for the fit when I'm screwing it in. I find that the comfortable grips allow me to work longer without getting a sore palm on tough joins. Great tools at a very reasonable price.
5,Best Meditation CD I Have Ever Purchased,"I was not sure what to purchase, but decided on this CD because I have the book. It has been the best purchase I have ever made. The meditations are wonderful and the affirmations even better. What I love is that the meditations are short enough that I can listen to them for a short time (10-15 min) and then get on my way. Shatki Gawain's voice is very calming and peaceful. I highly recommend this CD."
5,The best I have ever used,"I like this CD and I love the book. Right from the start when I first used it I found it to be really accessible and easy to follow. What I mean by that is that with some other cd's I have often become a bit bored with the way the dialogue went and lost track of where I was with the cd resulting in no focus whatsoever..This production is beautifully read, and may I add...it works ! Just love that grounding technique and pink bubble technique, boy does that help you focus on what's important to you.Shakti Gawain is such an interesting person, I love her and her work."
5,Rachelle Benveniste recommends this comforting classic,"Hello Friends,Many years ago I felt the need for a soothing voice and affirmative creative visualizations, something I could participate in to decrease the fear I was experiencing at that time.I found it at the Bodhi Tree bookstore and it was just what I needed. Recently I discovered II couldn't find it in my home but was so glad to see it still existed and I could buy another and I did,for myself and a friend. So, at times when I want to relax, I listen to Shakti Gawain's creative visualizations which help me manifest my goals, root myself to this earth, and feel the sweet and energetic vibration of her Chakra visualization.I also use these visualizations for my creative writing classes which I teach through Santa Monica college continuing education and at my home, through Writing in the Light.I recommend this to anyone who desires those affirmative, relaxing moments. This CD and her book are classics and I understand why.Rachelle Benveniste"
2,Grates on my nerves!,"The guided meditations are OK, but this woman's voice grates on my nerves - she sounds like she's whining, making it impossible for me to actually listen to what she's saying. I might like the book better..."
1,Its not peaceful enough for me.,Did NOT float my boat. If you want peace and a tranquil journey into meditation this may not be for you.
3,"Adequate, if only barely","This headset worked relatively well with cordless telephones that support a 2.5 mm connection. Static associated with the cordless phone was tolerable.However, the headset did not work well with a cellular telephone that also supported a 2.5 mm connection. Static associated with this cell phone was terrible.VXI parrot makes a slightly more expensive model that is far superior to this one. That model retails for ~ $30 and is well worth the added cost."
4,The Black Pearl,"Ramon Salazar is a young boy who trains to become a great pearl dealer. But the Town of Lapaz fear a monstrous creature named, Manta Diablo. He has no fear upon the creature and carries on to find the Pearl Of Heaven.Ramon's father spend time with him to train him how to hunt for pearls. Also he teaches Ramon how to be a good dealer, such as knowing what weight and value it has, etc. When Ramon was ready, he went with this old indian man.But the place where they were heading was the great chamber of Manta Diablo, that no one else knew. For the man was a friend of Manta Diablo, Ramon began to look for pearls with a relief. As he enters a narrow passageway to look for shells, he found VERY LARGE shells. He took a small one so that Manta Diablo wouldn't recognize it missing..."
2,The up's and downs of the black pearl,The book in the begining is a bit boring grantied that thist about every book in the beging is.It does start to get better and the book does have a lotof action and deep deatail. At the end it gets better so for my review i give it 2 stars.
3,Laura Beth's Review,I really liked that book. It was ok. I gues it was ok. I liked the part where the Manta Diablo was following them around in the night. Can you belive how big that manta was? Then he found the black pearl. It was a really cool story.
2,"Stupid, confusing, not interesting.","I was made to read this book at school. I have to tell you, I am not to impressed with it. I never really liked O'Dell's books, so it wasn't a surprize when I didn't think this one was to good. One thing I didn't understand was that Ramon stole the pearl from the Madonna when he agreed to keep it there. Some of the wording I really didn't understand which I had to read over again. Also, Ramon was so stupid to not listen to anybody's idea's but his, so he gets in so much trouble that you would think nobody would get in because they are not that stupid. Anyway, just don't get this book. Please!!!!"
3,I was shocked by some of the language,I thought the Black Pearl was going to be a harmless children's book. Little did I know that it was full of violence and sex. I suppose in this day and age I shouldn't be surprised but I was. If you buy this for your kids you may need to take a black marker to some of the racier parts.
4,The Black Pearl,"The book, The Black Pearl is a good book. It makes you think a lot.You never know what is going to happen. It just suprises you, like WOW! If you havent read it you have to. Its a good book."
4,The Black Pearl,"I read the book The Black Pearl for a project in school. The story takes place on the southern tip of Baja California. A young boy named Ramon is about to join his father in the pearl business. But his father goes to sea for a while and while he was gone Ramon asks an Indian man to teach him to dive for pearls. The man teaches him in the lake of the famous Manta Diablo. The boy goes out by himself one day and finds the biggest pearl ever near the Manta Diablo's cave. He brings the pearl home, but the Manta Diablo was hard on his tail. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and exciting stories. I think this book is for 11 to 14 year olds because I think if you were any older you would not find the uninteresting. I think boys and girls would enjoy the book because it is meant for either gender."
3,The Black Pearl,"The story was about a boy named Romon.He just joined his dad in a pearling busines called Slazer and Son.His hole life changes when he meets the Manta Dibilo.It was an excitting book :).A little confussing at times,But I recamend it for people that are 8 and over."
3,The Black Pearl,"The story was about a boy named Romon.He just joined his dad in a pearling busines called Slazer and Son.His hole life changeshe meets the Manta Dibilo.It was an excitting book :>).A little confussing at times,But I recamend it."
4,I never knew diving for pearls could be so interesting.,"This story is about a boy named Ramon who becomes part of his fathers business and tries to get his dads support by searching for the great pearl of heaven. He finds the pearl and shows his dad, but the next day his father dies, but it's no accident. Read the book to see who or what caused it."
4,"A very good book, easy read, yet perilous adventure","This is a very good book that kept me reading with it's colorful language about the infamous Manta Diablo, and how a young man fights for his pearl. It is a good book, one of those that you just want to curl up on the sofa on a rainy day with. Very hard to put down, but not a challenging read. Scott O'Dell spins this highly imaginative story of the sea, with such flair, it is the best books of his I have ever read. I am fourteen and found the book just a tad too young, though."
2,The Great Pearl ---,"""The Black Pearl,"" written by Scott O'Dell is somewhat of a very dull book, that is not able to catch the readers attention. Scott O' Dell has failed to create the same kind of enthusiasm as he did for ""Island of the Blue Dolphins."" It also borrows very obviously from Steinbdck's-""The Pearl,""--even the scene with the crooked pearl dealers is very similar. Overall its not much of a great book..."
3,My Awsome Book Review,"The Black Pearl is a very good book. It is about a young boy that takes his fathers place after his father taught him the trait of the pearling busniess. While the young boy was out pearling with out his fathers permission gets to meet the most feared creature of the whole town........ the Manta Deiblo. The house wives of yhe town threatened the little children when they acted up or acted badly by threatning them of being fed to the seven eyed, thirteen rowed tooth manta diablo. There were many different descriptions that were heard around the small town. The book has a very good ending. So read it if you would like to know the ending."
4,Kush's Review for The Black Pearl,There is this boy called Ramon. He finds the great pearl of heaven. His friends say to throw the pearl because it will create trouble. It does create trouble when Ramon's father doesn't come back from pearl diving. Read the book to find out more. I like the book in the beginning but at the end it getts a bit dull. The events the author chose weren't as interesting as in the beginning. So the end was a bit boring.
2,not a bad read by mohamad sabha,this book was not a bad read at all but the lack of eleboration was bad barley and deatails on how it happend just plain old straight forward like for exaple he died no reason at all just that he is dead. the story itself has no purpose i find it almost nonfictional almost all of it tells you about hunting pearls either way the charetristics were good but the backround and eleboration were bad.by mohmad sabha
2,The Black Pearl,I didn't like the book that much. It wasn't very interesting until the very end. The story was dull and boring in some parts which made it easy to guess what was going to happen next.
1,BORING,I Kim Stramaglia think this book was one of the worst books I have ever read.It had a boring plot and prdictable ending. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
3,George's Book Club,"This story introduces our main protagonist Ramon Slazar. He is 16years old and longs to find the most beautiful pearl in all of his land to prove that he is a man and be treated with respect by the book's main antagonist:Gaspar Ruiz (The Sevillano).The setting is Baja Peninsula, California a long time ago.When he finds the pearl it only bought jealousy.Then when they send the fleet out in the storm the Sevillano was the only one who survived. Angered that his dad didn't survive Ramon thinks that he needs to return the pearl to the Manta Diablo. But on his way to do it the Sevillano forces him to go with him and that they will sell the pearl together. When the manta follows them around the Sevillano tries to harpoon him he gets caught in the rope and drowns. After that Ramon returns to La Paz and takes the pearl back to the church. So,overall I thought the book was kind of serious but that's ok because I am getting used to reading more serious books."
4,Pearl divers,"Ramon thinks the legend of the Manta Diablo, the giant manta ray, is just a child's story told by mothers -- ""If you do that again, I will tell the Manta Diablo!"" Some of the pearl hunters in La Paz, including Ramon's grandfather, said they had seen the great devilfish and told fantastic stories of it. But when he found the great black pearl, Ramon discovered that the Manta Diablo was no legend. Ages 10-14."
4,The Black Pearl,"Has a perfect show of how much one little thing can cause another, and another thing to happen."
3,Cover Tells All! :),"This book was great just like the cover tells! If you like fantasy, mystery, and adventure i totally recommend this book! it's a very good story!"
3,The Black Pearl,I thought the book was very interesting and was very action packed.The book didn't want you to put it down.The book was very interesting and it was a very good survival story.
3,I've read better,"It starts out with a good plot and idea, but I think it really went to waste. Definate fiction and realistic fiction can be good, but this book was so subtle you couldn't tell it was either. I really don't understand how this book got a newberry award. The end is also really disapointing (I mean, I've read textbooks with more exciting endings)."
4,Great book,"I thought this book was ok. It starts out with Ramon Salazar growing up hearing about the dangerous Manta Diablo. When he is 16, he has his first pearling trip with his dad's business. He becomes apart of it. He soon goes to a location anf finds the famous, Black Pearl, and he donates it to the Madonna. The business goes for another trip without Ramon, but only one person survived from a terrible storm. Once Ramon finds the pearl is bringing bad luch, he decides to bring it back to where he found it, but was soon kidnapped. The kidnapper and Ramon set out to sell the pearl somewhere else. While on the trip, the Manta Diablo causes some trouble. The kidnapper wants to kill it and is soon fighting it under the sea. Ramon realizes he is free to go and he rushes back home with the pearl. He gives the pearl back to the Madonna and soon realizes what he did was right."
3,The Black Pearl,"The book The Black Pearl has a very interesting story. This book takes place in La Paz, Baja California. In this book, Ramon wants to prove to his father, Blas Salazar, that he is just as good as Sevillano, Ramon's worst enemy and Ramon's father's best pearl diver, at pearl diving. Manta Diablo, the monster of the deep, guards ""The Pearl of the Heavens,"" the ocean's biggest pearl, that Ramon wants to dive for. Ramon got ""The Pearl of the Heavens"" and brought back home. When Ramon tells his father about the pearl, his father gives it to the church. Luzum, an old Indian tells Ramon that he should give it back to the Manta Diablo because the monster will come after him. I recommend this book to both girls and boys who are at the age of thirteen and under because I don't think people over the age of thirteen would be interested in this book. I don't think that people over the age of thirteen would like the book because I don't it's exciting enough. Overall I thought this was a good book."
5,"Great Book, Must read!","Ramon found the fabulous Pearl of Heaven, but all it earned him was powerful enemies: one human, the other the notorious monster devilfish, The Manta Diablo, which guarded those waters. The story elements, rythmic writing, and the gravity of tone induce comparison to classic myth."
1,The one book I was told to read and actually did......,"And wasn't it awful. Slow, nonsensical, not to mention boring....Basically, it's about a poor guy who finds a black pearl. And then bad stuff happens. That is all the book is about. No sub-plot, no nothing. To be honest, the best bit was when the main character's baby gets shot and dies.The book (about 70 pages long, to be honest I can't remember. I don't want to remember) is really slow to start with, and stays that way until the last 10 pages where a million things happen at once. It is way too descriptive, and nothing remotely interesting happens. And then it just ends. It was really empty.I have read other ""Classics"" such as War of the Worlds, Animal Farm, Lord Of The Flies, etc, all of which had more substance and staying power than this."
1,Boring,"My son tried to read it and couldn't finish. He says it's excruciatingly boring. He compared it to the Little House on the Prairie.Are there any books out there that can capture the interest of an active, dare-devil type 12-year-old?"
3,Smaller than I thought,"I bought this item for a gift, so I don't really know how the clock works. I thought it would be bigger than it was. It's only about 4-inches tall. The metal hinged box that it comes in can also be reused in a boy's room. The Darth Vader watch opens to reveal a digital readout."
2,Poor Quality,"Bracelet does not look like picture. The picture makes the bracelet look as if it is a smooth silver surface, but when the bracelet came it was not smooth, it was lumpy. Also, very flimsy and felt as if it would be easily bent out of shape. If you are looking for a high quality bracelet this is not it."
3,This is great book,"""Dance with Wolves"", written by Michael Blake, is a famous book. It's a wonderful book because it explains some aspects of Native American History. It is great read because it shows the life of both settlers and Native Americans in the past. The book reveals the advantages and disadvantages of life. For example, if you lose a war you feel sorry, but if you win you feel great and powerful.John Dunbar is strong man. He made a brave decision by accepting to live with the Comanche. His decision impacted his life and his survival. I believe that this book is interesting to read, and I also liked the movie. It makes you think - if you were faced with similar problems in life - how would you survive?"
4,Enjoyable - modern version of Little Big Man,"Civil War hero Lt. John J. Dunbar is posted on the frontier at the deserted Fort Sedgewick. After realizing that no one is coming to join him, he befriends a neighboring Comanche camp. In time, he learns the Comanche way of life and with the help of Comanches Wind in His Hair, Kicking Bird, Ten Bears, Stone Calf, and Stands with a Fist, he learns the language and culture.After successfully fighting off a Pawnee attack, Lt. Dunbar (Dances with Wolves) marries Stands with a Fist and becomes a part of the Comanche tribe. In the end, he is forced to choose between his past as a white soldier or what he has now become - a Comanche Indian.The death, destruction, and disregard for nature by the whites moves him to stay with the Comanche.The books is enjoyable and quick reading."
5,Outstanding,"What a joy this book was to read. ""Dances with Wolves"" is such a wonderful story, and is so well told in this book, that I feel perfection can be applied to it. My only wish is that I had found and read the book, before I ever saw the movie. As is usually the case, Hollywood did not do justice to the story.Michael Blake has brought to life a time in our history that so fragile, and so very beautiful. He showed us that people are just that, people. He gave the faults, and strengths, the loves and hates, the understandings and prejudices that belong to the human race to both the whites and well as the Indians in this book, and just plan showed that these people also lived.I highly recommend this book to anyone. It should perhaps become required reading."
5,A Book For School...,"It started off all the 10th graders would read ""Dances With Wolves."" Our class was the last class to start reading, most of all my friends said the book was ""boring"" etc...I slacked it off for the first couple of chapters. But something caught my eye with Dunbar and Two-Socks, it touched me. I got into the book and just 10 minutes ago I finished it. Let me tell you we still have 2 weeks before we are supposed to be done. We just got the book about 4 days ago. This book kept me on the edge of my seat, I smiled, laughed, wanted to cry...I really want people to read this book. Its great for any age after 13. I told my mom to read it and for Christmas I think I'm getting her this book."
1,Paid for NEW and got USED!!,"I ordered this book as a christmas gift. I paid for a ""NEW"" one and the book I received was obviously very old and had been used. The binding was creased and front and back covers were bent at the corners. The pages were yellowed and stained from age and use. There was even a partial price sticker on the front cover from where someone had tried to sell it at a store of some kind. The quality is terrible and the ONLY THING ""NEW"" about this book is the sticker that was placed on the back when it was shipped to me. The word ""NEW"" is even printed on the sticker! OUTRAGEOUS!! Talk about your FALSE ADVERTISING!!"
4,lets you know how the Indians felt,"If you like a book with lots of action,then read this book. I loved the part where he first meets the Indians. It made me feel really bad about how we treated them and the buffalo. The freedom to roam on the wide open spaces seemed exciting, and I admire him for living with the Indians."
4,The Story about the West,"Do you enjoy stories about American history? The book, ""Dances With Wolves,"" written by Michael Blake is a spectacular story. This story is instructive. The author illustrates how important it is to change one's identity in order to survive in a different culture. The overall tone of the book is encouraging. This is an honest tale that describes relationships between an American soldier and Native Americans. The Comanches, a Native American tribe, are depicted here as real people. Readers gain access to the life of the main character through his intimate thoughts and feelings. This is also a great love story. I would recommend this book to teens and adults who are interested in stories about the Old West, American history, and good old fashioned adventure."
4,Dances With Wolves,"This of course is the book that inspired the hugely popular movie of the same title. I'd always been under the impression that it was a poorly written book and had no desire to read it until recently. As it turns out, it is in fact not the best written book, but it is an enjoyable and entertaining simple story of an American soldier who gets posted to a fort on the American frontier, only to learn that it is no longer occupied. The military soon forgets that he is there and after manning the post alone for some time, he befriends and then becomes a member of a band of Comanche. As a Comanche, he comes find himself and true meaning in life--not to mention the love of his life."
2,Phone overheats,"I bought this case last month from Amazon for my Treo 650. The case worked fine, until I started multitasking on my phone (playing mp3 and doing any other task). The phone's response became extremely sluggish when multitasking. I thought it was my mp3 software at first. However, when I use my phone without the case, I don't have any problems.I suspect the reason for the sluggish response with the case is the overheating of the phone, which results in the processor slowing down. The plastic cover on the screen is also hard to use with the touch screen on the phone."
3,case has some problems,"The case fits nicely but has several problems. The case muffles the sound on the Treo 650 because the hole dosent line up with the speaker. There is no opening for the expansion card slot. The clear plastic over the screen doesn't allow easy use of the touch screen. You have to push hard with the stylus , especially in the corners and I am never sure if it's too hard. I had to trim the plastic around the ear piece to hear the callers well."
5,Fits like a glove,"For anyone who doesn't own a treo, these things are like eggs, if you drop it something's bound to break. I fall into that catagory of unfortunate fools to have dropped my treo on my 3rd day of owning it. Luckily nothing broke, but I did add my first scratches in record time. I immediatly began my investigation for treo cases, after considering several different options I decided on the Krusell case. This case is light, classy and the fit is fantastic. As for anyone who may complain about the clear plastic cover (front) and how it may impair the functionality of the treo, I agree, but lets not forget what the overall purpose of this case, which is to protect and that is exactly what it does. As a treo owner I can honestly say this has been a great investment."
4,Good for the price,"This case does a good job of covering the phone, and gives good access to the keyboard and other control buttons. It's a bit troublesome to activate the touch screen near the edges, but not too bad. The opening in the bottom that allows connection to the USB or power connectors has to be pushed around a bit, but is useable.The belt attachment feels fairly secure. The phone rotates freely in the clip, and sits farther out than my last clip, neither of which I like very well. I have not used the other clips that are available for this case, but I like that they exist and plan to try the auto version as soon as I get a GPS running."
1,Awkwardly fits Treo's 700 p & w.,"The idea behind the case is great, but it isn't a great option Treo 700 (p or w) owners.I am historically rough on phones, and this case certainly has saved the phone from spills and falls. Sadly it fits awkwardly. The case is slightly too small which messes up the alignment of several key components. The left side buttons, the space bar, the top hold button, and most importantly the bottom ports for your headset, hotsync cable, and the power cable ports are not easily assessable. If you want to quickly plug your wired headset you must use both hands to expose the port then insert the headset.The Treo 700w is a great phone, a lot more handy than the Samsung i700.Take care."
3,A solid performer,"I recently bought a replacement for a similar Krusell case that I had been using daily for over two years. I like its design and durability.However, I have learned that while Krusell provides a warranty for the leather case it does not cover the plastic Multidapt clip that allows me to hang the Treo on my belt. It was this plastic component that failed necessitating the replacement.There is clear plastic cover over the Treo's screen. The thickness that protects the screen also makes it difficult to effectively use the touch screen, especially for functions near the edge of the screen. When I bought the original case I had the option of getting a unit with no plastic cover on the screen, but this was not currently available."
2,Great case but doesn't fit right on 650,"I like the case a lot and the easily-detachable belt clip is perfect for how I like to carry it -- mostly in the pocket but every now and then on a belt.Here's the thing though: maybe my case was defective, but there is a bulge in the lower left corner that makes it hard to type on the keys below it. It's like they sewed a little too much material, but only on that corner and the plastic makes a bump. Otherwise it's a five star concept and a great price. Too bad."
2,Treo case covers,It didn't have holes for the keyboard keys. How are you going to type messages if there aren't holes to hit the keys?
2,Not a wise choise,The quality of the case is great... the leather is amazing.. i used to have a krussel case on my sony erricson phone... BUT I didn't even realize till I got it that the screen is covered by the case with the plastic... how am I supposed to use a touch-screen phone/pda when I can't touch the screen... I wasted $30 and now I have to buy a new case.
5,a must read for horsepeople,"I would recommend this book for beginners or as a go-to reference for more experienced folks. It is clear and concise, well-written."
3,Super Reader,"This one is all over the shop. A couple of fur trappers, a female lion tamer, and some pinhead cannibals! Add in a murderer, and a scientist working on some H.G. Wells Food of the Gods action, and you have a book that just doesn't seem to hang together."
5,Well made cap,I bought this for my son and he really likes it. It is well made and the logo is good quality.
2,NOT SO SURE,This hat in the way it's made as far as adjustments and the over all shape of the hat did not work for me looks is great
3,FYI................,"The hat does NOT look like the picture. It is Black, but the word ""Team"" is white and the word ""Glock"" is dark gray. Not a bad hat overall, but not what I expected."
4,Nice cap,"I am 5' 11"" and this cap fits me just right. The only complain I have is the Glock letters are not bright white, they are colored gray (as oppose to the picture). For the price, will just deal with it and move on..."
5,Daughters of Hope,"Daughters of Hope is one of the most inspiring books I have read in a long time. The courageous stories of Christian women in third world countries surviving in non-Christian cultures was certainly an eye-opener.What was so compelling, was the fact that their stories are so current with what is happening around the world now. This book has certainly altered my view on the persecutions that are taking place daily against Christians world wide. Once you read the book, your outlook will forever be changed."
2,Disappointment,"Without even looking inside the book I bought B'Tx when I saw that this book was written and drawn by the same creator as Saint Saiya: The knights of the Zodia. That was a big mistake. This book doesn't even come close to the wild imagination of S.S. Action is there, but it doesn't go anywhere. But to be fair, I might have enjoyed it more when I was younger."
4,Best Spider Story Ever,"I read this book for the first time in 1982 and I've not found any spider story since that can equal it. It has spiders, mutations, mass hysteria, a good mystery. It starts innocently and ends with a nice touch of drama. I'd love to see this as a movie!"
3,You say you want a revolution?,"The best moments of ""Gung Ho"" take you back to the classic ""Horses"". The worst moments, the seemingly endless leftist political ranting, take you back to places better left unvisited. But the band, Lenny Kaye especially, burns strong and true. Patti seems unable to comprehend living in an E-world where the latest IPO is of far more interest to most rather than dated revolutionary posturing. Otherwise, this CD would have rated 4-5 stars. The band's energy has returned, it's just currently misdirected."
3,LISTEN BEFORE YOU BUY,"After four listens, I'm not convinced about this album. I don't understand how others can say it's on a par with her best 70s work? At this stage I like only the bluegrass number, Libby's Song. ""Gone Pie"" is passable but nothing special. ""New Party"" sort of gets there but not quite. There is none of the passion that characterizes her best work. A lot of the songs are plodding, uninspired affairs. The songs lack melody and direction. There's nothing anthemic about any of them. I am really disappointed."
4,"Still Patti Smith, but ....","Not the best of her more recent releases, I found the first half of the CD a little over-produced and commercial. Then ""Strange Messengers"" returns to the raw, defiant Patti I've come to admire. I much prefer her two previous releases from the 90's; Gone Again and Peace & Noise."
4,The pulse has dropped,"This is a MELLOW album. This is laid back instrumentals that will soothe your mind. Some of the songs are so quiet, you may forget you are listening to them for a moment. Acoustic instruments, some light electronic sounds, make for abreezy listen. Not a typical release from MUSH records, but everything they release is top quality.Nothing really reached out and grabbed me to make want to listen to it over and over again, but I would definately put it on if I wanted to lounge around or go to sleep... soon."
1,Recommend not buying this book,"This book has been a great disappointment. It is mainly vague generalities and trivial examples. If you need to use Subversion go to Google or Bing for the information that you need. Previously I would look in this book for an answer and then go to a search engine for more information. Skip this book and go to a search engine. To rate this worthless book on Amazon, I am required to give this one star which is why it gets one star."
5,THE BEST technical manual I have ever read,"Version Control with Subversion is THE BEST technical manual I have ever read. I'm relatively green in the world of revision control, but this book elegantly combines the technical with the practical with the theoretical. The style is very easy to digest, presenting some complex revision control concepts in concise, understandable terms. This is NOT just a ""skim the surface"" white paper - it is a COMPLETE guide to Subversion. (It is also a good introduction to revision control practices in general.)Buy this book to learn Subversion and support the authors. (No, I am not affiliated with them in any way.)"
5,Great Purchase,"At first I was somewhat apprehensive about buying a laptop, especially a refurbished one, from an unknown (to me) company. I have found that this is a great company. They gave me a great deal of support, answering questions, going the extra mile for this buyer. I would highly recommend them, and I would not hesitate to buy, with confidence, from them again."
4,Excellent introduction to astral plane and its phenomena.,I read this book first in about 1976 and have not found a similar book as complete in it's descriptions and fascinating in it exlpanation of the phenomena beyond our five ordinary senses. Hopefully more recent editions contain some information about Swami Panchadasi. My copy printed in India does not even have a publication date! So glad to see this rare book available again!
1,No Exercises At All - Only Theory,"I have read every single Panchadasi book in hopes that he would finally give some exercises.It is pathetic that this author makes claims in every book that he is going to teach the ""devout reader"" and ""committed student"" all the secrets to being psychic and engaging the astral world, but never does.He NEVER GIVES ANY EXERCISES OR INSTRUCTIONS AT ALL!!!Reread that sentence.This book is all description and theory from his perspective, and in many ways he is quite off the mark with his beliefs in comparison to what the occult community in general has accumulated by now.I honestly cannot think of any reason to read this book, unless you want to read old news and learn about old progress.Also, be careful. Much of his work is laden with obscure morals that threaten you against using your ""powers"" for good or evil- that using your powers for anything not deemed as ""appropriate"" by him will make them ""disappear"". It's utter nonsense.Skip this book."
5,5 stars for failure,"It's too bad that Joe xmas split, they had the world by the tail... well maybe not but I liked em'. Upstairs is a great cd, but it takes a little getting used to. If you like emo or weezer's later work you'll like it. Coupleskate is supposed to be the best song, it's nice but there's better on here (indo tengo, slick chicken). They did well for a weekend project."
4,Works for me.,"Pretty simple, the stuff it comes with works just fine. I've sewn up a few things and there's plenty of room to add more to it if I decide to."
1,NOT WHAT WAS PICTURED?!,"I got a totally different kit. So lame....and it was for Christmas, so I had no time to send it back to the seller...the one I got was a lame little nylon bag with a zipper....boooo"
1,Believe the bad posts - Junk,"Low quality, don't waste your hard earned money. Everything included is cheap, you may be able to use the wrapper for something."
3,big,much bigger them i imagined it would be i pictured something small enough to fit in the pocket this is more of a pack item
1,Very poor quality,"I purchased the region 2 of The Naked and the Dead and it is formatted in ""letterbox"" 2:35 x 1 not anamorphic widescreen 16 x 9. I was very disappointed because I really like this movie and the region 2 I purchased is barely better then the DVD-R I recorded from a TCM broadcast. This is such a good movie I hope a good quality DVD or better yet a BluRay version is finally released."
3,Not bad at all.,It's a pretty good movie. I've seen it a few times and I still like it. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD. The general in the movie shows us just how arrogant some of our military leaders can be.
1,Naked and the Dead DVD,"Very, very disappointed. I only wanted to get this DVD because my husband was in the movie. It didn't show the part that he was in and it didn't show the dedication to the unit that was in the movie. My husband said the original version had everything because the unit viewed the movie. Guess they had to take out something giving credit to an army unit."
1,not worth the price of a rental,this is one of the worst war movies i have ever seen. how can you make a war movie that has little fights in it and not one person in the movie that you can like. this one felt like it went on forever. skip it.
5,The Black Stallion Picture Book,This is a great book for children of all ages. My two year old loves the story!
2,Poor production results in minimal learning,"Unfortunately, this Homespun vid fell below expectations. Other products had much better camera views and repeated licks so they could be learned. This one had a slanted view of the keyboard, very little instruction and as a result, I was very disappointed."
5,Great polka music,"Bought the tape for my mother. It has good quality sound and good songs. She has records of this artist, so didn't think i could go wrong with a cd and didn't."
5,sometime sunday,Another great CD. Had this on cassette and I wore it out. Nice to find a replacement. The singer went to front Tragedy Ann.
3,"chances are this won't be read, because you haven't heard of these dudes, but....","sometime sunday is very nice good band, and it's pretty simple as that. if you apreachiate the guys vocals, he went on to a lighter sounding band, but still rock, called Tragadey Ann.i really give these dudes five stars, but for you perfection sticklers out there i made it three, they have talent and skill mind you, but it is not exactly flawless and masterfully played. buy both there albums. at 5 bucks for both of them its a great deal, plus if you don't like them, you can always sell them here on amazon for a higher price. have a nice day.."
1,Worst Album Ever,"The reviewers above must have been in this band. The only reason i'm even looking at the album page is that my friend and i were just talking about how bad it was. I bought this album when it came out ten years ago and my friends all laughed at me when we heard it, because i totally wasted fifteen good bucks. I tried to listen to it one more time and couldn't get through it. These guys never should have been signed. They bragged about only using single tracking, but it didn't help their complete lack of song writing talent. And the label ""christian"" has to be stretched way too far to cover this waste of plastic. I mean it. If you see one of these online, click your ""back"" button, and go somewhere else."
3,Nice sugar free alternative- if you are not sensitive to its possible side effects,"We were excited to try this product as we restrict our sugar intake...We made some brownies, which were incredible, but what followed was incredible in a different way...Both my husband and I had unbelievable gas for the rest of the night- it did give us some laughs, but when you try to go to bed and you just cant stop farting- its sugar free value is outweighed by the torment that ensues after consumption...Definitely do not eat hours before you go to work- if you work around others...unless you don't mind ripping all day long in front of your fellow employees or customers :)"
5,Great sweetener!,"This is a wonderful sweetener. Great for cooking, making ice cream, etc. Smooth, and good flavor. However, it is best purchased from the producer ""Joseph's Lite Cookies"" because they do not charge shipping on the product. When purchased through Amazon, they go through CarbSmart and shipping is charged."
3,Joseph's Maltitol Sweetner Syrup,"The taste to this sweetner is very good, with no after taste. I recently started using this sweetner. I have used it to sweeten beverages and cereal. It did the job well. The only draw back is that it gives me stomach cramps. For that reason I will not buy it again and will keep looking for a replacement for sugar."
1,Beware!,"Warning:Maltitol can produce intestinal gas, bloating, and diarrhea. Even if you don't exceed recommended amounts, you can still get sick like I did. Don't exceed 100mg (just under half a cup) in a day, or you'll become very, very sick. Don't say I didn't warn you."
1,Terrible After-Taste,"This stuff is awful. I'm going back to my liquid Stevia extractNOW Foods Stevia Liquid Extract Alcohol, 8 Ounce Bottle"
3,Use with caution!,"Only after I ordered this product did I become aware of the adverse side effects of use of it! Use in moderation and with care. The manufacturer says it can cause diarrhea if too much is ingested, but that's not how it affected me! Flatulence! Not diarrhea, just massive amounts of flatulence! Not very nice- so don't ingest if you plan to attend any kind of social gatherings!"
4,Great Darts...,"These are very good, durable darts. I bought them for my husband for Christmas and he loved them. The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is because after a few times of taking them in and out of the case, the case itself broke."
5,Boat shaped boombox!,very easy installation. comes with template for holes to cutout. has a rubberized foam seal. securely seals its self shut and also holds its self open! (not tested in open water yet)room enough for motorized face-plates to open and not hit the front of the unit. Could use a Profile(side) pic to see the shape. Top is narrower than bottom.Now my boat has a mounted stereo! To bad the boat doesn't have a running motor.
2,"Good for shop video, not that great otherwise.","The video documents a season of cyclocross racing in the United States. The filmmaker followed the circuit with an 8mm camera, taking footage of numerous races, and documenting the comments of the main participants off-camera while the footage rolls.Frankly, I found it boring. The film quality was grainy, by the very nature of 8mm film. There wasn't really a plot, just a series of comments on how much fun 'cross is, even if it does hurt like hell, and even if the footage was kinda neat, it was basically one long highlight reel, with no plot line or character development. I ended up donating it to my local bike shop to play on the TV during the day. That's about the only place it might be appropriate."
3,Not for everyone,"I enjoy reading fiction, and I read many genres. Never before have I read a novel such as this. It is an impressive work, but I personally didn't find the experience enjoyable. I spent so much weaving the fragmented threads of thought together, that it become something less than leisure. I gave it many chances, as this book is so well heralded. It is a difficult read, make no mistake. I hope this review won't be ""excused"" as coming from someone uneducated like all other negative reviews of this book has been."
2,"Dissatisfied, but willing to give it a second chance","To be fair, I haven't read the entire book. I quit sometime around the point she first described her boy's father, Liberache. I can't help but feeling confused, though, why someone who is intelligent (though I am doubtful she is as smart, Mrs. DeWitt I mean, as she wants to believe she is) finds the urge to chop down anyone and everything so irresistable. There is such an undercurrent of bitterness in this book, bitterness directed at Ludo's father, bitterness at the higher education system, that there is a little left over for anyone more successful than herself-at least up to the time this book was written. Beyond that, I thought she was too cute, too clever in her writing, and what I enjoyed in the first few pages had disappeared by the time I got to her studies in Oxford. I knew I had to quit when I started rooting against her, because without an attachment to its protaganist, this book is unreadable."
2,Encarta Autbography?,"I was left wondering if Dewitt was an american academic who had been to oxford, had a baby, and decided to write a book about it all which she filled up with a whole lot of apparently erudite information which is now actually available from any number of internet sites or, in her case, on line dictionaries or grammatical primers. At best, a reasonably well written ""dump"" of a lot of vaguely interesting info-tainment."
2,"ok, but nothing special","Like ""Little Man Tate"" in that the story of a mother and son seems but a thinly-veiled portrait of an insecure former ""gifted child"" who has read a bit too much Ayn Rand and finds herself superior to the hoi polloi. DeWitt should stop showing off for a minute and work a little bit on developing plot and characters in her next book. Disappointing, although it did inspire me to learn more about Greek."
1,Divergent opinion,"... this is no A. S. Byatt production... little enjoyment in reading; the author leaps about with little continuity as if she struggles with making sense of her own world; the references don't suggest erudition, merely showing off; emotional engagement with the characters is an impossibility; where is the border between eccentricity and insanity?"
1,Emperor's new clothes,"I agreed with ""pretentious nattering"". I don't feel that an intelligent book necessarily needs to ramble on with intellectual references that have no basis in the lives of everyday people. I found no truth in any of the characters in the book except in the way they might exist in the mind of the hyper-intellectual. If this disqualifies me from membership in the club, I'll have to just live with that."
2,This book should be titled......What The Heck Does This Mean,"This book was very difficult to follow. The primary audience of this book is seminary students who are already fluent in greek, hebrew and latin. Dr. Voelz even takes simple things and explains them with examples that are difficult to follow.There are many good books in the Concordia Scholership Series for the layman, but this is not one of them.I gave up after a few chapters."
2,Very Disappointing,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I first watched it when I was younger on VHS and it had subtitles for everything. On this DVD, there are only subtitles for the spoken words, and not for the music and songs! Those are what keep the story moving along, and in this DVD you have no idea what the two lovers are saying to each other. I am very mad and upset about this. I would love to find this DVD with subtitles on EVERYTHING!"
3,Good movie but,"Fabulous Amitabh movie! Keep in mind this is an older movie, so the quality is not going to be blu ray style. It is however good enough considering the time it was made. I bought the dvd copy that had ""its a sparks presentation"" on the cover and rest assured there are subtitles for the songs in this version.Edit: As i watch this movie, i realize there is a goood 15 minutes cut out from this movie ( the introduction of shilpa shirodkhar and the part where they introduce drugs into sridevi's car)"
5,Virtuoso hand drum ensemble.,I picked this up on the advise of a friend and am thoroughly blown away by the muscianship of this ensemble. It's amazing how melodic and beautiful hand drums can be when played by such obviously skilled musicians.
1,"NOT TOO BAD, BUT ...","i ordered this cd for a lot of money from the states (i am from germany), mainly because it was said to have lots of middle eastern percussion. well, there is a bit of middle eastern instruments, but no middle eastern style. the main influence is indian music.you can't say a thing against the capabilities of the musicians as such, but i don't like the compositions at all. i bet the the musicians had fun recording this stuff, but it's just no fun listening to this cd, more a showing off of some techniques.i listened to this cd once, and will never listen again if i won't be forced! ..."
4,AWESOME!!,"This tooth and nail debut album from upside down room is one of a kind really. The guitars are simple and tuneful, the lyrics are somewhat avante garde but very listenable and poetic. I would put this in my top ten of underground albums that should be heard. I have listened to this since 96 and still enjoy it. It has not dated at all."
5,Excellant,Karen has made it posible for one to find what is needed to learn about fitness with more than just exersize she gives tips on how to mentally prepare yourself as well as some pretty good recipes. I personally think the book deserves a 10 for the simple fact that she helped me belive in myself enough to get fit when nobody else could
5,Dancing on the ceiling,"My mother-in-law likes it that much she is dancing on the ceiling, with my penny lover.Thanks very very much!"
5,LOVE THIS MUSIC,I LOVE THIS MUSIC. HE IS ONE OF A KIND. I AM 53 YEARS OLD AND LOVE LISTENING AND REMEMBERING THE DAY. HIS MUSIC IS STILL GREAT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. FAST SHIPPING AND NO PROBLEMS GETTING TO ME.
3,not as definitive as you might think,"Look, obviously this is a good collection, almost if not all the hits are here, fidelity is fine.But if you love the ending of the version of ""All Night Long"" on the original album ""Can't Slow Down,"" you won't find the full ending here. The editors have cut it 15 or 20 seconds early, starting the slow fade sooner. One of the nicest things about this track in its original form is the way it faded in the end with the horns. The original gave the horns full play and then slowly faded, while on ""Definitive Collection"" the fade out starts almost as soon as the horns begin playing.I do wish people would stop dicking with songs on the margins on Greatest Hits Collections. It is happening everywhere. It's getting to the point where you just can't trust a Greatest Hits collection to deliver the full goods anymore.Curses to whoever edited this album!"
3,Could Be Better,"The American version of this is not as good as the British version. The American version could have produced a far better compilation with more of Lionel Richie's hits in it. The British (UK) version is a far better version comprised of a double CD package with lots of Richie's hits along with several of the Commodores hits. This makes for better listening pleasure. The UK version covers Lionel's entire career not only as lead singer with the Commodores but as a solo artist. I would definately recommend the UK version of this compilation over the US version. If you can't get the UK version, then I guess you will have to settle for second best."
3,"Definitive, No","As a Lionel Richie fan I found this CD to be a farce, a misnomer. This release is anything but ""Definitive"", for one simple reason, when one comes to the selection, ""Still"", it is a shorten version for radio play, not the original.Shame on you Motown, for this is nothing short of a ruse, a sucker play. This is why I gave this release only three stars.Otherwise this is a good collection of Mr. Richie's hits."
4,"ah, the memories!",I have always enjoyed Lionel's voice. Loved The Commodores and I liked Lionel's material when he went solo.Listening to this CD makes me recall those prior days! worth having if you like Lionel.Has my favorites.
5,great collection of both lionel and the commodores,This is a great collection of the very best songs of both Lionel Richie and the Commodores. Not everything is here but it's great for a casual fan. A good mix of career highlights from both periods and an album you will listen to for a long time. These songs have been around for a long time and sound as good as ever. I enjoyed this album so much that I started to look into the other material available from both acts. It is really good.
4,Really Enjoyable!,"I know he has a lot of cheesy love songs, but he sings them GREAT!!!!I like nearly every song on this CD, and have really enjoyed it!Good CD to listen to when you are chilling out!!!!"
5,Great CD.,I loved this CD since I loved all of the songs. It arrived quickly and I am happy with the purchase.
4,Love all types of music.,"I enjoy all the songs that I grew up with in high school. They will always be comforting, upbeat, and great. The price was good, the quality is great and the shipping is on time."
4,"Great collection, but missing something....","Where is the song ""Deep River Woman"", the duet with Alabama popular in the 80's? I can never find this song on any compilation of Lionel's or Alabama's!!All in all, a great compilation although there has already been one. Lionel has been one of my favorites since the beginning of his career!"
5,WONDERFUL MUSIC,GREAT CD... ALL HIS BEST HITS. LOVED IT. PLAYS LIKE NEW LOOKS NEW IF YOU LIKE LIONEL RITCHIES MUSIC YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD.
5,The Best,"It's like I am living in the 80's his songs mark so much of my life, Ballerina Girl, Hello... If you were a teen in the 80's you will remember how good Lionel Richie is."
4,"Not That ""Definitive""","Granted this is a great career spanning collection of Lionel Richie's work, and it includes all of his 80's smash hits.However, it does not include the funkier/uptempo songs that he recorded with the Commodores. There were a number of hit Commodore songs like ""Too Hot To Trot"" where the lead vocals were shared by several members of the group, including Lionel.Tracks like this should have been included.Two new songs are part of the collection, and while his duet with Enriquie Inglesias (To Love A Women) was to be just OK, his another new track here ""Goodbye"" is stellar. This song ranks right up there with his other first rate ballads, both from his solo days and from his time with his former group.So while this package is not that definitive, it is still worth the purchase."
5,HIGH FIVE FOR LIONEL RICHIE,"A classic collection of Richie's ""Love"" songs. Although I love the old tunes, ""Goodbye"" is a song that touches the soul. Love this collection!"
3,A bit disappointed,"I was a bit disappointed with this CD because it was the one version CD and didn't contain all the songs. I had to re-purhase the european version which was two CD version with all the great music. I should have read the fine print better before purchasing the first CD so just a word of advice, if you want the complete album be sure to look or the european version ane they are hard to come by."
4,International 2-disc version better,"As several reviews have pointed out, there is an international 2-disc version featuring 38 songs. Obviously it is a better version because it contains all of the songs featured on the US release, plus more. Nevertheless, the record company still stuffed up. Titled ""Definitive Collection"" you would expect all singles to be included before fillers were given a spot, but not the case here. Fillers have robbed the CD of key songs!The obvious hit singles missing are ""My Love"", a great ballad with Kenny Rogers on backing vocals, and ""Deep River Woman"".The 2-disc edition is still worth hunting down as it is the most comprehensive collection to date. It certainly supersedes ""Back to Front"" (1992 release)."
1,Right wing hypocrisy...!,"I'm neither Demorcrat or Republican, since both in my view.. Republican party being the most sponsored by corporations rather than real people. But I just cannot comprehend the ""religious right"" principles its morals on others by its sheer indoctrination homophobia, xenophobia, and its proselytization of people of different faiths..."
5,Electrical Engineering Classic,I used this book twenty years ago. As a young electrical engineering student at IIT. This is an absolute classic. I used to think of it as a clear sign that the Soviets were better than any other country in terms of their grasp of technology. The clarity and incision of thought process as well as simplicity and penetration - I still remember today.It is a pity that this book went out of circulation - though I am happy that the Soviet Union did - somebody should revive it. It would still make the best first textbook in electrical engineering anywhere in the world.I lost my copy somewhere down the road - I still fondly look for a copy of this book whenever I traverse the Engineering book section of any book store or library.
4,a rare gem,"radiohead fans a must. anyone else with $30 on hand, an open mind, and the ability to trust this print then get it. good luck finding this one in the stores, but you can find it at most online music retailers. Thom yorke sings some pink floyd(wish you were here) that is actually recorded over the phone from his hotel room. the results are pretty cool. the rest of the album is pretty cool too, but thommy takes me on this one. buy if you can."
3,hug therapy,"this book is quite small, and somewhat disappointing,not enough hugs are illustrated and the text that goes with the illustrations seems incomplete.Not enough information.This little book should probably be cheaper also."
5,A wonderful solution to a tricky problem...,"I was given this book in a training session at a nursing home. It was wonderful and helpful. Most importantly, Hug Etiquette turned out to be an answer to prayer for a young couple at a church I attended.Their innocent, loving daughter liked to give Full Body Hugs! This was very uncomfortable for several males and worrisome for the parents. They needed a way to tell her not to hug everyone that way. I gave the Hug Book to them. It provided the perfect foundation for a discussion about hugging and how to do so in a way that was more polite without discouraging her.Thank You Very Much!"
5,He is just to Cute!,He was bought as a gift but he makes me laugh so much I don't want to wrap him up!
3,"Flowers, Etc. Sheer Window Panel","I received these curtains just a few days ago, which I bought to go with the Flowers Etc. Comforter and Sham.I was upset at the quality of the curtains. The appliques inside the square panels are removable because the squares are not sewned together and the material they call sheer is a very thin cotton that has to be dry cleaned! Not to mention the amount of wrinkles in the curtains-that I hope come out from hanging."
5,The Best Alt. Rock Band You Haven't Heard Of,"This is bottom line my favorite cd. (got it june '01) A great band and NO ONE has really heard of these guys. Please if you like straight up Alt. Rock this cd wont let you down. it's got Ballads, all out rockers, and everything in between. filled with solid song writing, catchy hooks, awesome vocals, and a tight rhythm section. these guys rock..check'em out if you like'em show your friends. this band is too good to go un noticed. hopefully they're still together. recommended if you like bands like Fuel, Better Than Ezra, Vertical Horizon, Audiovent, ect.. this cd wont let you down"
1,Triimer,Highly ineffective. Pulled and dragged nostril and ear hairs without trimming them on both male and female hair.
4,The Rods Rock!,"This is good, old-school, head-banging, fist-pounding metal. Nothing too complicated here, but it doesn't have to be. If you wanna rock like it's 1984, then this is a great place to start!"
4,Hot!,"Great classic Heavy Metal band at one of its best. ""Let Them Eat Metal"" composition was hit in Poland played on the radio many times in the middle of eighties....by the way: cover is very original and very hot too."
4,not for everyone,"The empirical writing of this book is extremely useful for those familiar to the public relations industry but will be difficult for those unfamiliar with the subject. For those wo are just beginning or even just have a non-professional interest in public realtions, I would recommend they read Guerrilla PR Wired by Michael Levine instead.The Expressive Organization's differing perspectives and opinions of the authors expressed in this book may make it hard for those not of an academic nature."
3,It's OK if you're into this kind of thing.,"I heard a preacher recommend this book, so I bought it. It's not as compelling to me as perhaps other books, but it could just be my personal prejudices at work."
2,Disappointing,"This looks to be a really beautiful book. But if you are intending to try and make the really nice looking swirly candle o nthe front cover in the centre, you will be very disappointed. The cover of this book is very deceiving. It shows how to make most of the ones advertised on the front, but not the real pretty which is only in the book for display purposes only. I find that highly deceitful to print pictures on a book of how to make candles."
1,"vile, hateful smear campaign","Filled with errors and cliches born of fear and hate, this book is disgusting. It will only appeal to those nut-job creationists who have already made their mind up about same-sex marriage. What is is about the idea of 2 men or 2 women raising children in a loving environment that offends these people so much? If you want what is truly best for the children, let them be raised by people who love them, not a family filled with hate."
1,Nothing New,"There is nothing new in this book. It was written to ""preach to the choir"", to cement pre-existing opinion rather than to present evidence and change minds. Researched with a ""have a theory, we'll find facts to support this theory"" rather then any real scientific method. Claims that God's marriage plan of one man, one woman was set in stone from the beginning of time, yet ignores that polygamy and use of concubines was God's rule of the day in the Old Testament. Even if it were not poorly written, the thought process investing in this book is lacking."
3,This Compilation Shortchanges the Customer,"David Arkenstone is one of new age music's best-selling artists. This gifted multi-instrumentalist (keyboards, guitar, flute, cello, et. al.) creates haunting music of both grace and beauty, and he certainly deserves a ""best of"" package. The problem is the definitive anthology came out three years ago, the 2-disc VISIONARY: THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION. That album contains all 10 songs from BEST OF--plus an additional 15 tracks--and it doesn't cost that much more. If Narada found it necessary to release a new ""best of,"" it should have at least been updated with new material from his more recent releases. As it is, this compilation (which clocks in at just under 50 minutes) shortchanges the customer. Five stars for the music; three stars for the value."
4,Bittersweet exposure,"This cassette was my first exposure to an animated Astro Boy, and while I was thrilled with the cartoons, the video quality was less than perfect. The flaw was in the recording, however, and not in the cassette (in other words, the cassette wasn't damaged). Other copies may not contain the same flaw, and the episodes are a fun, black and white trip back in time, so I recommend the video for anyone looking for an enjoyable anime history lesson."
2,Astro Boy good - transfer bad...,"Review is of the product, not Astro Boy who is always wonderful.. ^___^A poor effort at film to video transfer... With the wealth of tools available to restore old films and bring this type of vintage material ""up-to-date"" these videos are a big disappointment. The glossy 4-color package doesn't make up for the many glaring flaws on the films which could have been digitally ""cleaned-up"" but its obvious not much money was involved in the production of these videos. Astro Boy, the first ever regular TV anime by the great Tezuka deserves better than this. This caliber product wouldn't not even be offered for sale in Japan where high quality standards are the norm."
2,Mostly common sense,"I realize that 'common sense' is a risky term, but for myself and most people I know, that's what a lot of this is. Most of the 'Toxic Ideas' that the authors debunk are not (in my experience) commonly held ideas. They do an expert job of explaining how and why the ideas are indeed toxic, and what ideas would be healthier and more accurate. But when you don't hold any of the ideas to begin with, it's a pretty silly read (some examples of the 'toxic ideas': 'Ultimatums Settle Disputes', and 'Problems Go Away If You Ignore Them'). I give it two stars because the authors do what they claim to do in the book, and I'm sure there are people out there who will find it immensely helpful. But as far as usefulness to a person of average intelligence, experience, self-awareness, and, yes, common sense... well, it's just unnecessary. Not worth the money; I'll be donating it to my local library."
4,Great song...,"I can't remember where i heard this initially, but it's got a great dance beat and is one of those fun songs. I don't think she ever really had another song as big as this. I also tracked down the video, the extremely low budget production is something to see."
5,Great Book!,Item shipped promptly and in the condition as advertised. Would do business again and highly recommend this seller.
3,Toddler Tutors effin rule!!!,"This is hands down one of the best CDs that I have picked up in recent memory. The combination of educational wisdom, self-deprecating wit, and blazing improvised sax solos make for one h*** of an amazing album. Totally, rock and roll y'all! But completely appropriate for the kids, which is what it's all about anyway, right? I listen to this almost every day in the car when I take my children home from school and it actually gets them to open up and talk to me and tell me about their wonderful little days. Being a mom is hard work, but with ""My School"" blaring out of my car speakers, the world just seems like a slightly better place to live in. Highest recommendation.Shari GreenbergP.S. The cover art is A-mazing!"
5,Ms Underwood is back and her writing is better than ever,"....This novel introduces the new, improved, and more likable Sydney Teague, a woman well aware of her addictions, but no longer brooding over them. Sydney does what she believes needs to be done. Thus she shows a moral strength and sense of duty that few people possess. This actually adds to the believability of the character, which in turn gives credence to of the well executed mystery. In VOICES IN THE SAND, Anne Underwood Grant has written a one sitting page-turner that charms the audience form start to finish.Harriet Klausner"
4,Enlightening,I think that book realistically expresses life's challenges in a way that even a child could understand. It was a reality check as well as a motivational piece. I have not stopped talking about making lemonade ever since I read the book.
5,Still on constant rotation!,"Me again, I've had this CD for a few months now and it's still a favorite! It brings back so many warm and fuzzy memories. Enjoy."
5,I Want to Get This!!!!!!!!,"I want to get this CD! If I ever see it at a used CD store, I'm going to get it! I was introduced to alternative music by The Cure (They're not on here). This is probably the best CD to introduce you into alternative music!"
5,Great Songs from the Eighties,"It reminds of late nights with friends trying to tune the radio to the local college stations. We would listen to these songs in between the static. This is the best in what was called ""Alternative/New Wave"" music. Definitely a must have."
1,Dissapointed,Warning: I was replacing a worn CD - I liked it so much. The new one is different and missing Joey by Concrete Blonde.???
2,Welcome back to 1950,"I really gave this book a chance. On the good side, it DID help me see why my husband acts the way he does. That is the end of the good.For some reason the authors found it necessary to blame all marital problems on women. Now, men are the way they are and we have to adapt to them. WHAT? What about compromise? Give and take? Why should we be so accepting and conforming to their behaviors? They chose to leave out the part where sometimes he has to bend a little as well. For example- the book says you should always have your home spic and span when your husband arrives from work and make love to him like a godess every time he bats his eyelashes. Excuse me. I have 2 children, one of who is under the age of two. Enough said.I would not recommend this book due to the lack of ability to take both sexes into consideration. It's a man's world."
2,"Some good ideas, but tone is a bit degrading to women","I really wanted to like this book...however, the tone really makes a woman feel a bit like a doormat. There is little encouragement of actual being ""real"" with the person you are with. Intelligent women appreciate advice that allows them to be open and honest about their needs and to be able to compromise. The focus of this book seems to leave this out."
2,"Only for the ""good wife""","I am sure there are women who will appreciate this book but it just wasn't for me. I found it difficult to swallow some of the advice such as, if you have stopped cooking dinner for your husband then get back in the kitchen. I think you have to be in the right mindset for this book as it is entirely focused on what you need to do differently as the wife. For me it was difficult to get through everything I need to do without asking my husband to take any action steps. Hopefully there are wives out there that can appreciate this book more than I have."
3,Side Dish is Pleasant Fare!,"Side Dish is a pleasant story but it is not a romance novel. There is little lust and wanting. The main character is lackluster and discouraged. I think that if you want to read a somewhat amusing story about a young lesbian's struggle to find her way--you will find this book somewhat enjoyable. However, if you want a juicy romance you will undoubtely leave Side Dish still hungry."
4,Oldie and a goodie,"It is amazing how this sound was so far ahead of it's time that it seems even ahead of it's time today. The indie sound effects in vouge today seems fresh to me on this CD. It is very experimental, but still rewarding. I'm am a late comer to Danielson because when I first heard him years ago I just wasn't ready for it. A great CD to add to the collection."
2,pretty basic headset,"call quality is kind of bad, my wife just hates this headset. I am thankful for the handsfree aspect but not impressed with call quality. This headset is already out of use after about 4 months and I think it's headed for that great big headset party in the sky...."
5,A little bit of England in a jar,"My husband came over from the UK about ten years ago. When he first arrived here in the states there were very few companies importing at least from a retail product standpoint many of the things he missed. If you have never had ""pickle"" with very nice cheese and artisan bread you can not even begin to image what you are missing."
1,Agree with Displeased,"This is a very small laptop bag. I have a Gateway and the bag was three inches to small. It would be a great bag if they had made it larger. It offers a handle and a backpack option thus giving your laptop ""handles"" without room for much else."
4,Did the trick,"This fit my husband's Toyota Camry and works like it should. I used amazon's online product match-up tool to find the right fit for our model. I was surprised to see the product was red rather than black as pictured. But that's not the reason for the 'missing' star. I bought a replacement cap for my husband's Camry a few years ago in an automotive store for almost half the price (yes, he loses them every couple of years). This time around I chose the convenience of ordering through amazon.com over price. Still, I don't think it should cost this much."
5,Loved this book!,"I so enjoyed the story-telling aspect of this book - it engages the reader in the story while the reader is learning. As always, the most important aspect to wealth creation is changing your mindset - you have to believe you can, because if you don't believe, you will never even try, and that will guarantee failure. I also liked that it tells you to set specific, easy to remember goals. That way once you are done reading the book, you are ready-set-go on your path to financial freedom. You don't just put the book down and forget about it. I highly recommend this book!- Aimee Elizabeth, Author of Poverty Sucks! How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire."
5,Insight on reaching your full potential,"The Instant Millionaire - A Tale Of Wisdom And Wealth, by Mark FisherSimply put, 15 chapters of mystery, theory, and psychology. If this doesn't open your mind to a new reality and perspective on your financial self-worth, I don't think anything will.Mr. Fisher writes this fable in the same style and format of bedtime stories that you listened to as a kid. The author is in fact a self-made millionaire that implemented this process himself in his own life.This story is based on Mark Fishers experience when he met an old man who passed on his secret to success to Mark. The bottom line is that financial prosperity and a life well-lived are goals we can all achieve if we understand and practice the principles of success.I highly recommend this book, and suggest you read it to your spouse or children at bed time, as it is an adult fable to be remembered."
1,"Waste of Time - Trite Message: ""Believe in Yourself""","There's nothing in this book that isn't already in a bazillion other books. I listened to the audio book, and over 2 hours later, the only significant message to be peeled from the slow-moving, over-dramatized story was simply : set goals for yourself, and believe in your ability to achieve them. That's got to be the most common advice in every self-help, wealth-building, and children's book out there. Sure, it's good advice, but do we need yet another book to tell us that? There was absolutely no tangible, ready-to-apply financial advice in the book. In the end, the old millionaire simply gives the young, struggling, wealth-seeking man $25,000 to start his own endeavor. So it would seem that the way to become an ""instant millionaire"" is to simply ask an existing millionaire for money. If you really want to become a millionaire, don't expect this book to help."
1,"It's a commercial in a book, mostly spam!","This is my first book review. I wrote it because of how disgusted I was at this book. This book is nothing but a stoooopid story about a man who is poor and fed up with his job that wants to be a millionaire. As a multimillionaire myself (self-made, I worked for it), I thought this book would be amusing. The book is about this poor fellow going to see a 70 year old man who is only called the ""Instant Millionaire"" in the book. The ""Instant Millionaire"" has nothing to say about making money, and it's obviously a load of hogwash. It sounds like one of those infomercials on TV talking about how to get wealthy by doing ""1 hour of work a week"".The book is full of total trash and nonsense. ...Do yourself a favor and buy a real book, something that will teach you something. :-)"
5,Wonderful Concept,"My heart was moved with the content of the Instant Millionaire book. What a wonderful concept to know that in an instant; with a changed perspective in our thoughts, we too can become a millionaire. It is just that simple, but not easy. It was definitely clear to me that when life happens for all of us, the thoughts and problems we face on a regular basis become a norm and therefore, we create in our life more of the same. This is why when presented with the concept of being a millionaire, most people cannot conceive it. It is a matter of changed perspective and focus as highlighted throughout this book. I consider it a gem of valuable knowledge worth learning and remembering."
3,Puzzle,My wife was not entirely thrilled with this puzzle. It was much to easy and she had this one done within four days.
4,Jigsaw from Amazon,This jigsaw is fun if you do not want a very demanding puzzle. The pieces are easy to find and it makes for quite an enjoyable pastime. There is really nothing more to say
4,Great Puzzle Tons of Hours of Fun,"The puzzle was great, the only drawback was that one of the end pieces had fallen off the cardboard so our puzzle is complete but one puzzle piece is just a cardboard colored brown. No picture there.Otherwise we kept worrying that more pieces were missing from the puzzle but the puzzle did have all the pieces included."
1,Mislabeled size,This is NOT a men's XX-Large by anyone's standards. It may be a children's XX-Large but noone would consider this a men's XX. I returned mine and will not buy this brand again.
2,Legend of Hawaiian Slammers review,"The intro basically showed the whole pilot for you. The rules of the Slammers universe are vague and often contradicted themselves. The lead kid is bland and forgettable. Not to mention, ""The Shining"" thing was too much. You get a feel for Shadow Slammer and Sun Slammer but the rest are rushed. The Animation is pretty good. The action is pretty good but it's also cluttered and rushed too. The Villains are bland and phoned in a mile away. Overall, A so-so at best. I give this cartoon a 2 out of 10."
5,"non-toxic, no odor","I really like these highlighters. Beyond their being non-toxic and having no weird odor, their ink doesn't seem to react with and smear ink on the page as much as other highlighters. I agree with the prior reviewer that the purple is quite dark - I just use it for circling and bulleting items. I've used up a couple of yellow ones, but the others, despite being in my drawer for a year now, show no sign of drying up and work as well as when I bought them."
2,Not very good,"I purchased these pens for my college studies. Out of the whole pack I only have the pink left. And unfortantly it's not because I used them alot. My orange blew up, and the other colors just stopped working. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't get them to work. I love the idea, but won't be purchasing this brand again."
4,101 mile-an-hour punk,"While some of the edge from Pokinatcha is lost here, it's made up with the catchier hooks and faster rhythms. MXPX shows that they can play melodic pop-punk with the best of them. You must buy this CD! MXPX deserves to be played on radio stations all across the country. They leave Green Day in the dust in terms of musical ability, yet they still haven't had that break....yet. Time is on their side though, they're all still in their early twenties."
4,One of the most awesome cds in the world!,This cd is too cool and i think it is a must-have for all MxPx fans. It was my first cd of them and i was totally impressed. The fact that it is an old cd is the only thing keeping it from 5 stars. MxPx in general is the greatest band of all time!
5,punchy pop,"having grown up with roots punk such as ramones, descendents, generation x, and other old schoolers from the first wave, mxpx with all their youthful exuberance does indeed continue in the footsteps of these other legendary bands. very honest and incredibly melodic, mxpx are way more honest in their confusion than other newer bands like blink 182 and green day. they are not corporate toys, just a few crazy kids that just want to skate and play punk. tenage politics is a very good album. songs like ""do and dont"" and ""sugarcoated poison apple"" are masterpieces. the only problem i have with this band is their slant on occasional christian preaching which is really goes against the original punk revolution. it is pretty easy to ignore though and the upside of this is that lyrics are honest and generally positive. instead of a lot of songs about political revolution you have a lot of songs about girls and teenage life which is, of course, just fine with me."
2,Brings back memories,"I bought this CD when it came out in 1995. I was 13 at the time and this was punk rock. I have since grown up and my musical taste has grown also. I still enjoy independent rock and the like but this CD is just horrible. The only reason I gave it a 2 was due to my past love of the CD. If you want to take a magical trip back to the mid-90s, get this CD. If you're 13, get this CD. If you're not, don't bother."
5,Sweet Punk Rawk,This is the top MxPx CD in my opinion. It's got that hardcore punk edge whithout the trash talking and unintelligible lyrics. MxPx is one of my all time favorites and this is some of their best punk rawk.
4,a lot different that slowly going the way of the buffalo,"it's a lot harder. faster, and must crazy. songs are great though, money tree kicks! i recommend you get it!"
5,by far the best MxPx album!!!!,this one is deffinately a keeper. it brings out the punk rock happiness in all of us & has increadibly thought provoving lyrics! I love it!
4,Very Engaging,"These are short stories about various people from Viet Nam who have come to America and more specifically to Louisiana.I'm certainly no expert on the people of Viet Nam and am thus not qualified to comment on how well Butler captured their spirits.I did enjoy most of the stories very much. Many of them are very short (6 to 15 pages) and are simply odd little snapshots of life. The narrators of the stories are varied. They are men, women, old and young.At first I found the stories to be interesting but not that powerful. About halfway through the book I felt that the cumulative effect was significant. For these stories, the whole was greater than the sum of the parts.My favorite short story in the collection is ""The American Couple"" which is an exception in the book because it is more than 80 pages in length.I very much appreciated this collection and feel that Butler treated the subjects with respect and affection."
5,"20 Years Later, Still a Prize!","Truly masterfully crafted tales, conveying essence and nuance. Each one is an emotional spelunking adventure, deep within the heart. Robert Olen Butler writes as everyone wishes they could!"
3,Review for Audio Version,"Yes, A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain won the Pulitzer, so I had to get it. I have both the print version and audio--stick to print, it's a winner.As for the audio, Robert Olen Butler, though an awesome writer and who apparently trained as an actor, didn't do the reading of these stories justice.Anyway, I'm giving the audio version 3 stars, good stories--but not all the stories are read, only 5 are. I'd stick to the print version."
3,No more war,"As we deal in being a nation at war, it is sometimes good to reflect on the past.Vietnam, a conflict whose scars still lie deep in America's psyche is of often misunderstood.With fifteen short stories in A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain Stories by Robert Olen Butler, this book takes you into the ordeals of the Vietnamese.The voices are young, old, and a diverse background. The mix brings alive and humanizes this often misunderstood period of our nation's history.A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain Stories by Robert Olen Butler movingly gives life to multilevel impact of the Vietnam War."
4,An Insight Into a Different Culture,"I probably would not have selected this book to read on my own since I don't usually read short stories, but I am glad that it was required reading for a leisure learning class I took. Butler really opens ones eyes to the Vietnamese people and their culture here in Louisiana."
2,Poor,"This is highly sentimental writing that bored me to the core. It tinkers with high emotions and big themes but mostly manages to paint everything in either bright pink or drab grays. Some of the outsider perspective shines through, but the tinny two-dimensional (and often child-like) tone had me folding the book without quite completing it."
2,Nothing to write home about.,"I can't say that I hated this piece of fiction but when I browse some of these glowing five star reviews I wonder If they can possibly be referring to the same book as I am. I enjoyed some of the stories and I admire Butler for stepping out of himself and writing about a culture that isn't his own. It is a bold move and I think he does it well enough... However, I just can't rank it that high, I mean five stars! I can name a dozen other books that really rocked my world and made me think about things differently or contain certain phrases and scenes I still think about! Some of the reviewers here are too generous Im afraid.Summary: Sorry folks, no epiphany here.- this review was not written by the named above."
4,Khmer Language,"A great book to have on hand for the beginner and for those who's primary language is khmer. This book is a must have for anyone wanting to have anin depth look at khmer writing styles and formats. I was intriqued with the clear, concise, and pronunciation excercises. As a Khmer/American, I learned alot more than I ever did. Thanks!"
3,Good content but poorly bound,This book is for those who are serious about acquiring Khmer. The phonetic key was very helpful. I was fortunate to have help from a native speaker and it still took me a while to figure it out. The pronunciation can be problematic for those completely new to the language.The pages comes loose after about every five pages.
2,Brodeur's deserves better,"A good, but not great account of the best goaltender in hockey today. The ghosted effort to write in the first-person doesn't work. Still a good read for the dedicate hockey fan."
2,"Just like in the net, Brodeur give up very little.","I'm a huge Devils and Brodeur fan, but this book was a disappointment. I learned almost nothing that I didn't already know. Brodeur has had a very interesting life, but he reveals next to nothing about his ex wife or his teammates. Other then money, I can't figure out why they even bothered to publish this book."
4,Brodeur fan,"If your a Brodeur fan, you'll enjoy the book. It's an easy read. I personally wish that there was more of his ""routine"" type stuff in the book, but that is just my bias as a hockey player also- wanting to know what he does. It goes into it a bit, but not enough for me! Other than that, it goes into more detail in some places relative to others, so sometimes it's overkill sometimes you want a lot more, but overall, worth it to read."
5,enjoyed it,Loved this book we really enjoyed reading about his life and career in hockey. We recommended it to all our friends and family who are hockey fans.
5,Great book,This book gives you an inside look at an NHL player. One must read this expressive and should know its considered a must read
3,What happened to Barbara Dawson Smith?,"I used to eagerly look forward to new novels from Barbara Dawson Smith, but her last two novels have been highly disappointing. The characters are overblown and idiotic. And I really hate it when the characters are constantly questioning one another's motives in the most banal of ways, e.g. ""but could she trust him?"" over and over again when there is no real basis for such a question.I will give Ms Dawson Smith one more try. If the next book is equally formulaic and flat, I will stop bothering to read them."
1,terrible disappointment but should've known,"The official reviewers panned this romance, but because just about everything Smith has written has been at least passable, I thought they were being too harsh. Not so!The hero is neither likeable nor intriguing, and the story leaden and choppy. Stay away from this one. Try her best stories instead, in my opinion, Never a Lady and Her Secret Affair (if you like the reluctant male lover type!)."
5,A complex and engaging legal narrative,"Epps' book is one of the best in recent memory to explore a Supreme Court case. Examining the case of Oregon v. Smith, Epps deploys his skills as both a journalist and a novelist to plumb the depths of Indian rights, religious freedom and states rights. The only quibble one can have is that the book spends too much time on the minutae of Oregon Attorney General Frohnmeyer's life. Other than that minor matter, this is an elegantly told tale. As an aside, Epps presents a concise yet complete recouncting of the Rajhneesh cult saga of the '80's, relying to good effect of the work of Oregon Magazine Editor-in-Chief Win McCormack."
1,over-hyped and not worth the trouble,"the top and bottom blades don't meet, so it doesn't shave close to the skin. its not even close to a normal buzz cut. the claim that the ceramic blades stay cooler than usual clippers is a joke. the bottom plate is still metal and was burning hot within minutes. it got hotter than the clipper it was replacing, which starting overheating after about a year of use. i thought i was taking a big step up from standard clippers but the fancy features ended up being worthless."
2,Clipper heats up fast and stays hot,"Not sure if it was just the one I purchased, but the metal guard gets hot within a minute and stays quite hot. Pretty much unable to use it without another comb set over it or it will burn the persons scalp"
3,Slow Speed,"Slow speed and cannot get close with these, seem well made as long as you use them for longer cuts."
1,Defective leather sheath,"The leather sheath was already ripped off. Nothing special about this knife, not even for collection."
5,A Fun Read,This was a fun book to read. Though at first I wasn't all that into it. It seemed slow at times and then there was so much going on. But it grew on me. A character to really pay attention to is Libby. You'll wonder what she's up and why. I also liked reading about Leeds oppossed to London. You don't hear to much about Leeds so this was a breather from those books set in London. This is one of the better Red Dress Ink books that I've read. It's a great read.
1,Disappointed Feet,"The story had a promising start, but by the time I was about halfway through, it began to drag. From the 3/4 to the end... I was unhappy. It had such an interesting premise, but things just went to a very sour and entirely too neat end."
3,Second rate Bridget Jones,"Well, where to begin?The thing is: after Bridget Jones, there were many copycats and this book is one of them. Enjoyable, yes, but way less than BJ. The heroine, Jo is not remotely as funny as Bridget and you just cannot feel yourself rooting for her.The plot is very weak at times, the characters - not very deep and the end: very, very predictable.Good summer read, you can finish it in two days. But I wouldn't really recommend it."
5,A won't want to put down...,"Okay, I'm from England, so maybe I'm biased, but I see that this book has been nominated for an American award, and it really deserves it. It's one of the best of it's genre I've read in a long time. The plot is brillant: When everything seems to be falling apart, career, love-life, Jo gets in touch with her ex by means of a bogus email identity and discovers all sorts of things she never knew before - about Dan (the ex) AND herself.Meanwhile Libby, a potential 'bunny boiler', tries moving in on Dan while at the same time pretending to be Jo's friend. There's temptation for Jo as well in the form a gorgeous Italian.We see the story through three pairs of eyes - Jo's, Dan's and crazy Libby's, which keeps everything cracking along at a very fast pace.There is not a single dull moment in Guilty Feet and I can't recommend it more highly."
2,You get what you pay for (or less),Was not very happy with these forks.Very cheap and flimsy. Mine came in an envelope and were bent all to heck.When I tried to straighten them out I realized how cheap they really were. They bend VERY easy.Makes me wonder if they are even stainless.I say spend a little extra money and get a better set. I know I'm going to.Plus the price dropped a buck and a half after I ordered mine.
4,"Buy this album for the guitars, not the vocals","Jason Martin is one of the most amazing, creative songwriter/guitarist I have EVER heard. Dual Overhead Cam is one of the best songs, in my opinion, ever written. It's offbeats and original sound is what makes Starflyer 59 stand out from most every other band out there. This is a CD you should buy, not because it's cool, but because it's a true work of art."
3,Fun Little DVD to Add to the Boogie Pop Collection,"Well... After you have read all the manga, then watched the anime show, got a bit confused, then went on to read the novels... what else do you do?Lets buy the Live Action! Right guys?... Oh... Am I the only one?...Basically what goes on in this is the same stuff that happens in the novels and some of the manga (that means it takes place before the show)I watched it twice so far... once was just to watch it, then I watched it a few years later to make fun of it... It was decent both times.If you are a fan of Boogiepop, you might as well complete your Otaku obsession with this Dvd... if your not a Boogiepop fan... you will be horribly lost and confused as a attractive Asian chick in a biker outfit beats the crap out of random things while some school girl in a dress puts on a outfit and become a super hero."
3,"Good, but troubling","Bunker's definitely a felon, a bad person who has hurt othersthroughout his life. But he can write, and he opens a window to a ruthless underground jungle few of us ever see. I sure wouldn't want him as a friend (few have escaped that role unscathed) but the books are compelling. Somewhat reminiscent of Bukowski's self-justifying assault on convention: highly entertaining if taken in the right spirit."
3,"Interesting, but sloppy","Being a fan of Bunker's fiction, I was disappointed in this memoir, not by the content, but by the execution. Certainly his life is an interesting one and an inspiration to writers--which makes it all the more a letdown by the repetition, the awkward phraseology, and for chrissake the TYPOS, that mar this work.I won't try to get into the self-vindication aspect of the book, because it is, after all, a memoir and is advertised as such. Suffice it to say, however, that here's a man who has much to get off his chest.If you've read all of Bunker, as I have, then you might find this book interesting. Far better, though, to read the novels which permitted him this bit of excess."
2,Literary lockup,"Reading this memoir was the equivalent of mental lockup. Wasn't the page turner I anticipated. In fact, it wasn't a page turner at all. It was slow and laborious w/a lot of peeking ahead to see how many pages were left. And, as another reviewer remarked, there were enough typos to keep a copyeditor employed. The memoir reads like the author dictated it instead of sitting down and writing it. In instances, his dates are off, ie, how could he be squiring a Penthouse Pet around town in 1960 when the magazine Penthouse didn't come out until 1969? Things like that wore on me. Instead of feeling excitement or suspense, I started to wonder how much of the book was real and how much was, well, fiction. Stick w/Bunker's novels instead, especially his gritty, No Beast So Fierce. Or if you want a great prison yarn, try Henri Charriere's Papillon."
2,Bunker is still ripping people off,"I have read many prison memoirs from Caryl Chessman's work to Ed Sanders jail-house poetry. There is something compelling about how we survive when kept locked up in a cage. All of the penitentiary prose, whether good or bad , has an element of gut wrenching truth that keeps a reader entranced. So it was with Bunker's Education of a Felon, until the realization comes that this guy is making up stuff as he goes along. I could not finish this book after reading for the 20th time his unbelievable total recall of conversations that happened 40 and 50 years ago. Give us a break Bunker. It is too bad you didn't break out before this book was written."
4,"Fun story, beautiful illustrations",I enjoyed reading this book and am giving my nieces and nephews a copy for Christmas. Elisha's story plays on children's own beliefs and fears; the belief that they can do what grown-ups do and the fear of being separated from family. It has a happy ending and absolutely beautiful watercolour illustrations.
3,Bath Basket,It is a functional basket however it's made of plastic and the quality could have been better.I had to use silicone in order to secure it on the wall.
5,Excellent puzzle!,"This puzzle was not only challenging, but very interesting too. My husband and I got addicted and it still took several days to completed."
2,Old puzzle,"I got this puzzle to give as a gift and was very excited about it. However, the puzzle I actually received is not the one pictured! The one I received is from 1994 and only shows the presidents up through Bill Clinton and has blank spaces where Presidents Bush and Obama would be. Otherwise the puzzle looks great, but I'm disappointed that it isn't as up-to-date as the picture makes it appear."
2,"Cute story, but shy on facts, long on philosophy","A cute story about how a mysterious investor helps one man get his business off the ground, and in so doing, imparts a business and life philosophy. I found the ideas of profit sharing with employees to be good policy. If you are looking for a more in depth book on business practices that are visionary, or details in implementing visionary ideas, this isn't it."
5,Not your typical business text book,"A change of pace from most business books. It is written as a fictional account of a business owner and his mentor Bernie, a retired businessperson who helps the entrepreneur see how to build his business while treating people right. A very nice book.This book came to me at a time when I needed inspiration and not another text book on business."
3,Good quality; bad sizing,"While the quality of the shoes was everything I expected the Florsheim name to represent; the sizing was considerably off. The shoes could not have been ""eee"" width as labeled. I could not wear them and gave them to my nephew."
2,Prelates who live in glass houses...,"Some good insights into true reform. So this reader is left wondering, why didn't the good Archbishop start by writing ""The Reform of the Archdiocese of San Francisco"" instead? Perhaps then he could've shown us how his proposals might actually work -- by removing the scandals in his own backyard. Maybe he could've subtitled it, ""The Costly Call to Christian Purity and Holiness""."
4,Ideal metronome for all directors and musicians,Pros:-Very loud AND adjustible volume-Clear reference tones: B2-C6 (useful for choirs)-Simplistic design: Rotating dial and beat selector switch (instead of buttons)-Headphone terminal (earbuds included with metronome)-Bright LED pendulum-Metallic stand-Powered by 9V batteryCons:None!Other thoughts:-Could use a new design-Should come with a case
2,Broke after 2 months,"The metronome initially worked fine but after 2 months it started giving problems. It used to skip beats, I replaced batteries but the problem got worse after some time. It just used to stopped in the middle of playing and sometimes make screaming noise. I again replaced battery but that didn't help. It just stopped altogether!"
4,mostly excellent,"great metronome. A good ""click"" instead of a ""pitched beep"" like many metronomes have.. the only downfall is the buttons/switches are so unbelievably cheap feeling. Please just make a good metronome and charge what you want!!! I""ll pay a few bucks more if it was just completely perfect, instead of just mostly perfect! Still, it seems to be one of the better ones I can find."
3,"Good sound qulaity, but Dial is easy to break","I liked the sound quality of the MR-600, and easy set up of the beat/tempo thru the dial. One major flaw is the dial tend to be easy to break. On the first couple of weeks of use, my 5-year old daughter dropped it to the floor and the dial just broke off and cracked on the base. I could not re-attach it back. I'v been trying to find the dial replacement on line but to no avail."
4,Very pretty,"Pretty, nice styling, very comfortable, very cute overall! I find them more beautiful than in the picture. Soft and shinny, fantastic color (mine are red). The price was fantastic too (a very good discount!). I thought that the outer was completely leather, but it isn't or at least doesn't look like at all. The little plastic tag in the inside of the shoe said ""leather sock and pu upper"", so I suppose the ""pu"" stands for poli urethane... I don't know, but I like them so fine that I don't mind this very much, even considering that I was looking for leather shoes instead. The description of the product should be more clarifying."
5,Nice title...,"As I am a Japanese who read this book in Japanese when I was a junior high student, I thought this English title is really suitable. The original title in Japanese was ""Me-mushiri, Ko-uchi"", which has a some distinctive rythm in Japanese. Speaking of story, this makes you think very deeply even though it is a shorter story than other Oe's numerous novels. It contains racism, autarkic village, and many other things which people want to avoid to think or see in everyday life. As it was written before Oe's breaking his own writing style, it is very readable, too."
4,A wonderful story of being a reformatory boy in wartime.,"Nip the bud shoot the kids is one of the best books I've read in a while. The different setting and narrating will keep you wanting to know more. You will start to imagine yourself in the young mens shoes. The book is as realistic as they come even though it's fiction. For example, Minami and an accomplish tried to escape from one of the remote villages they were in, they got caught by some of the villager and Minami talks about how they were chased and beating by some of the villagers. I have never really liked books about wartime, so for those who feel the same way I did, you need to give Nip the Bud Shoot the Kids by Kenzaburo Oe a try."
5,Junie B Jones Is a Beauty Shop Guy,"Junie B wants to cut hair, so she cuts her bunny slippers and her dog's hair! Then, she tries to cut her hair! Will it look awful? Read it to find out!"
5,Junie B. Jones Is A Beauty Shop Guy,Junie B. always gets her words mixed up and that is why she is so funny. Trying to make herself beautiful she cuts her hair.
3,Kindle Version,"I love this book, however the Kindle version is missing some pages. I had to make up a few lines to make the story make sense. Unfortunately, I was reading aloud to my Kindergarteners!"
5,Awesomeness,I love this book so much I could not put it down this is one of my favorite books by this arthur
4,A fun book,"""My name is Junie B. Jones. The B stands for Beatrice. Except, I don't like Beatrice. I just like B and that's all.""Junie B. Jones is a 5-year-old (almost 6!) girl who is full of mischievous adventure. In this, the eleventh book of the series, Junie B goes to a beauty shop, and realizes that that is what she wants to be when she grows up. She starts practicing on her stuffed animals, and on her dog, and finally on her own hair...all with disastrous results!This is a fun book. Junie B is very silly, and very opinionated. Some parents are a little too serious for Junie B, and she is definitely NOT to be taken serious. My seven-year-old reader and I both liked her and her adventures, though we both agreed that what she did was not right. We both enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it."
5,Read This Book If You Want To Be A Beauty Shop Guy?,"Have you ever wanted to be a beauty shop guy? Well I read a really good book. It's called Junie B. Jones Is A Beauty Shop Guy. And the Author is Barbara Park. I like this book because Junie B. Jones cuts off her hair and she goes to school with a ski mask on and her horn hat on. When her teacher sees her wearing the hats she says ""Junie B. Jones why are you wearing your hats in school ? "" Junie B. Jones said, "" Because I cut off my hair."" And also I like this book because Junie B. Jones goes to the beauty shop and the lady asked Junie B. Jones if she wanted to help her and Junie B. Jones said ""Yes"" but then Junie B. Jones swept up the lady's feet. And Then Junie B. got fired. See what happens next, see if she still wants be a beauty shop Guy!"
5,Junie B. Jones Is A Beauty Shop Guy,This book is about a funny little girl who is in kindergarten. She cuts her own hair and puts on silly hats.I wish this book was longer.I give it five stars.
4,Junie B. Jones is a Beauty Shop Guy is a hillarious book.,"Junie B Jones fugured out a new name one morning, and ran down stairs to go tell her mom and dad. She climbed on a chair, and told them out loud, ""Listen, up! I found a new name, and it's Pinky Glades Gutsman!"" She got pinky, because it's a beautiful name, and Glades Gutsman from the lunch lady. The next day she found out that her friend Grace's aunt was coming to visit to show her how to hair cut and run a beauty shop. Junie B. decided to practice. Her dad went to get a hair cut, and Junie went with him. She met a lady there named Maxine. Maxine said that Junie could be her little helper. She gave her a broom and said that she could sweep hair. Junie ran into a lady's feet with the broom and knocked her over. Her dad got mad and paid Maxine. Read this book. It's a really nice book. Junie B. Jones gets into a lot of trouble. At the end it turns out pretty nice. Enjoy!"
1,Junie B Jones is insufferable!,"Ok, I know these books are really really popular and I get it: the really poor grammar and ""cutesy/funny"" situations that Junie B gets herself into probably delights many beginning readers and their parents, BUT........Maybe it's just me, but I find the main character, Junie B to be incredibly babyish and, well, how can I put it politely: mentally challenged.How many Kindergarteners actually say things like ""bestest"" or describe their teacher as ""That guy"". My daughter, age 6 and a first grader, actually asked me if there might be something wrong with Junie B Jones. ""Mama, why does Junie B Jones do things a little baby might do like cut off all her hair? Isn't she supposed to be about my age?""Anyway, the books have been banned from our house. I put them in the same category as Barney.There are plenty of other great books out there for beginning readers that don't insult your child's intelligence."
1,A bad example in every way.,"I read this story to my five year old daughter and was amazed. It has no redeeming qualities at all, the grammer is atrocious, even my daughter pointed that out. The story is about a girl who plays with scissors, trims her bunny slippers, her dog and her own hair and there are no repercussions,( she has her scissors taken away but seems to have an endless stash in her room) in fact she is rewarded by a trip to the beauty parlor. This book sends all the wrong messages, please read some other books to your children."
1,An English teachers nightmare in grammar,"Actually, I would rate it O stars. Perhaps it is trendy or cute or socially acceptable to encourage bad grammar in our children these days, but not is this house. Examples: ""It popped right into my head when I WAKED up this morning!"" ""Daddy RUNNED his fingers through his hair."" ""ME and Daddy drove in the car a real long time."" ""After that she HOLDED my hand. And ME and HER took Daddy to the sink."""
1,What a hard book for someone learning to read incorrect grammer and spelling?,"The student I am working with was having a lot of trouble with the grammer and spelling in this book. I asked the teacher if it was a good book for someone having trouble reading. Her answer was about this book even though I did not tell which Author or book it was. ""Is she reading Junie B. Jones Book? I know that these books have a lot of incorrect grammar. I thought I took those books off the shelves becasue other mentors commented about the problem with the grammar. If she can not see the difference between the correct and incorrect grammar then she should not read the book. Thanks for your concern. I also got your other email about the ""runned"" problem. I will make a note of it."" If the child read well and gets that it is a joke. These books maybe fine but not for a school age child trying to learn to read!"
3,Reader beware!,"Cute book as all of the other Junie B. books, but beware! I read this story to my kindergarten class and one child decided to try his hand at being a 'beauty shop guy' himself! He cut about 2 inches off of one little girl's long blond hair and a big chunk out of his own. I won't read it again to my kinders."
2,"Nice pix, but.........","I'm afraid I have to agree with Mr. Noble and pvjim- the pictures are pretty cool but the text is not. Neither I nor anyone I know in the sport of motorcycle racing has ever heard the term ""lime juicers""- Scalzo must have simply made this up. The story line jumps around and is hard to follow chronologically and the part about the Honda RS750 is simply completely wrong. I'm glad I bought the book for the pictures and because there is so little in print on the subject, but there are so many mistakes in grammar, spelling and historical accurracy that I could not in good conscience use this book as a source for any other article or book. Still, if you are 8 years old, the pictures are cool!"
2,"Works for me, but is it harmful to my toilet?","Currently use this product but just threw it out. Only complaint had been expense & when tablet is new, strong bleach smell when flush makes me flee the bathroom.Now reading these reviews, I will no longer buy such products. Surfing I found there was a Clorox Class Action Settlement Lawsuit Complaint Over Clorox Automatic Toilet Bowl Cleaner With Bleach. Claim form had to be submitted by January 28, 2011.Note the lawsuit is mentioned in a comment to an existing review, but I thought it should be more visible."
1,Destroys Toilets,"After using these for just over 3 years the inside of my toilets was shot. The plumber replacing them said that the warranties for toilets are voided if you use such cleaners, and showed me the warranty disclaimer on the new parts he installed. While this product may reduce the amount of toilet cleaning you have to do, I have concluded that the corresponding shortening of the life of your toilet is not worth the cost."
1,Can't handle the smell,I wanted to sanitize our toilets but after using this product for a couple days I had to pull it out. The smell is unbearable. Like another reviewer said they have a public bathroom odor. It's awful smell. Terrible buy.
3,"Works great, smells awful","I used these tablets in my upstairs bathroom and in a powder room off my living room. They keep the bowls very clean but they smell terribly of bleach, which I can smell in the living room. I guess I should have known. No signs of any damage so far, but I strongly recommend you have some strong masking counter-fragrance running in the bathroom 24/7 if you don't want it to smell like a public toilet."
1,Buyer Beware,"""Stong Oxidating Agent""... I'd say so!I have little doubt that this product cause rapid rotting of the rubber components in the stoppers for two different toilets in our home. I personally installed both within the last couple of years. Now I need to replace them again. One was over a longer period of time (different composistion of rubber), but the other was for a toilet that was rarely used, it happened within a couple of months after using the tablets there. Looked like it was melted by flame! No way that water alone could have done this! This may be because of the infrequent use of the toilet; where the chemical drawn from the tablet built up over time."
4,Great product,"I love this product because I hate cleaning the toilet. It says ""automatic toilet bowl cleaner,"" and that's exactly what it does. For as long as the tablet lasts, you don't need to touch the inside of the bowl with a brush...it just stays clean all the time. It's never lasted me quite as long as advertised (usually lasts me about 2 months), but it's more than worth the money. When I notice a ring starting to form again at the water line in the bowl, I know it's time to drop in another. Although I could just clean out the ring, if I wait a day or so, it goes away on its own. It gives the water a slight bleach smell, but you probably wouldn't notice anything if you didn't pay attention (aside from a clean toilet).Obviously, since this is dumping bleach into the bowl, don't use it if you have pets in the house that might try to drink the water."
1,Does more harm than good,"I have used these Clorox ""cubes"" (as my mom has always called them) for many, many years. Over those years, I cannot even tell you how many toilets I have had to fix because of the damage these things wreak in your tank. Your toilet will leak like crazy (into the bowl, not out onto the floor) and will cause your water bill to shoot up because these things damage the seals in the back of your toilet. One of my toilets are in need of repair at the moment and I just picked up the new parts today and I am not letting these things anywhere near it. My sister doesn't use these and she has only had to replace one seal in her toilet in 14 years."
4,Works well,"I've used these tablets (and other similar brands) for over 10 years on the same two toilets and they do a great job of keeping the bowls clean and free of rust staining from our water. Only on rare occasions when a toilet hasn't been used in a while is any bleach odor noticeable. I've noticed no apparent ill effects on my toilet hardware or seals and I suspect the cautions about tablets harming these are overstated. That said, the new cartridge system cleaners look easy to use and the cartridges would be nicer to handle than the tablets are. They also aren't much more expensive and may be worth it for your peace of mind if you are concerned about the toilet seals."
1,Seriously Strong!,"While I am sure the product is doing a great job of sanitizing your toilet bowl, the pungent smell (which I suppose proves it is indeed working well) is really way too overbearing!I love the smell of clean, but these tabs are seriously strong! The biggest problem though, is that the strong odor these tabs give off is not a fresh, touch of bleach scent. The smell these tabs emit reminds me of public bathrooms at swimming pools. There is that distinct smell of not just bleach, but other cleaning agents, which makes for a not-so-pleasant smelling experience (at least to me). Definitely not a smell I want in my bathroom ever again!"
5,"A brilliant, disturbing story","I only hope Creep is a work of fiction and not some psycho's truly disturbing autobiography.Creep has a way of getting under your skin. I was immediately drawn into this book and couldn't put it down for one moment. The story is absolutely gripping - and brilliant. The reader is actually one of the central characters. The reader is an individual who mocked the Creep character and is now being tracked down for a ""hit.""This book is unusual, downright weird and I highly recommend it."
5,Love Nuzzle,"I bought Nuzzle for my son when he was 3 months old. He has slept with him every day since, and carried him everywhere. My son is almost 4. Nuzzle is well loved but is still holding up, great quality Ty!"
1,Useless - Copy of tourist office pamphlet,Warning: Buyer beware - It's a 16 page pamphlet with no substance it contains no more than what you would find in a free promotional pamphlet you pick up at any tourist office. We are Disappointed.
3,You can figure Florence out on your own!,"This set of walking instructions is terrific if you are very limited with time in Florence. These walks will take you around the major sites; however, Florence is an extremely concentrated city. It's not the behemouth that London/ Rome/ or Paris is. Therefore, with any basic map (Insight makes an excellent one), most travelers can plan a basic route. I left this map in the hotel room, and once oriented to Florence (which takes a day) was more than capable of finding these points and major streets on my own. This little foldout is for the traveler with very litttle time or interest in planning his/ her itinerary. The times given for the walks are fairly accurate, though."
4,"In-Depth Look at Writer's Block, Plus Solutions.","Here's an in-depth guide to many of the causes of writer's block that also offers some unique solutions to the problem.If you want to write but can't get started, can't stop revising, can't complete what you start, you may find the suggestions useful.A previous reviewer mentions that the book contains ""too much psycho-babble"", and true, it does have a fair share of that. However, for a writer who has tried just about everything else to break through being blocked, what is there to lose by trying this method?Reading this guide feels like sitting down with your shrink and discussing why you have this problem with writing, and being told what you might try in order to overcome it.As I said, if nothing else has worked in breaking your block, it won't hurt to try this psychological approach to the problem."
1,not worth the money,"I'm sorry , but this book is the most poorly written book on writing I have ever read. All you writers out there--please do not use it as a model. I'm glad if it has helped some of you get past your blocks, but I've worked with blocked and anxious writers for over 15 years, and I would never recommend this book to them. In my experience, it is far too simplistic to address more than the most basic types of block. The ""brain research"" used to support the book's premise is pretty weak as well. Bottom line: Not worth the money."
2,will your opposite hand give you a different answer?,"For those who believe in hidden powers of the mind, this might be the book for you. But I know that if I answer a question while writing with my right (""dominant"") hand, the answer to the question will still be the same while I fail miserably to write with my left hand (which doesn't get a very good workout often). I have to agree with the review below me, there's a whole lot of psycho babble here that I could do without. I only gave the book 2 stars because there were a few solid tips & I got a few chuckles here & there."
1,PLEEZE!,"I pre-ordered this book when I saw a write up on it in ""The Writer"" magazine. I got through about the first 60 pages and took it back to the bookstore. Oy - too much psycho-babble! Charts, non-dominate hands - give me a break! Don't waste your money, just sit down and write."
4,I Can't Stay Long by Laurie Lee,"This is a book of essays by Laurie Lee. Having read his autobiographical novels, I wanted more. I was not disappointed. I found these essays very thought provoking and entertaining, in particular Part Three which consists of his accounts of countries and cities he has visited. His use of the English language is just beautiful. I really enjoyed this book."
1,Awful,The tired thoughts of a tired old man. Anyone other than Laurie would never have had this book published. Cliche ridden & fatuous.
4,Nice book for a Wyatt in your life!,Sweet book with beautiful illustrations. I bought it for a new baby in our neighborhood named Wyatt. The preschool aged children in the book have a good friend in Wyatt!
1,Doesn't Fit 8610,I just got this for my Vox 8610. It doesn't fit it and the plug on the adapter actually broke after a few attempts to plug it into the phone. If you have an 8610 its total junk.
2,Short but not very interesting,"The book is very short, which is good, but not written in a particularly interesting fashion (i quit about halfway through it). The 'awakening' that is refered to by the title is the spiritual transformation of the town. Skip it and read ""Hostage to the Devil"", which is well written, has a variety of contemporary posession cases and contains the Roman Catholic ""Rite of Exorcism"""
3,Puzzle helps bring history to life,"I bought this puzzle for my kids because we were studying the civil war in school. It is really a beautiful puzzle, very informative, and enjoyable to study once it's completed.My only disappointment is that we were missing three pieces of the puzzle from the time that it came to us. Therefore, we couldn't glue it together or frame it. Also, the pieces just didn't seem to interlock tightly together. There was quite a bit of shifting.Overall, it's really a very interesting visual. It's a great way to help bring history to life for any family."
2,"Small Box, Small Picture for Complex Puzzle","I was really looking forward to doing this beautiful puzzle with my family. When it arrived, we were surprised to find that the box (and therefore the picture of the puzzle) was much smaller than other White Mountain Puzzles we had done. It was hard to see the details or read the script that is part of the puzzle. I don't know if moving to smaller boxes/pictures is a recent move by WM, but I feel it's a mistake; you shouldn't have to use a magnifying glass to work a puzzle. (Please WM, your puzzles aren't cheap, do you really need to downsize your boxes/ pictures?) Amazon, could you list the box dimensions as part of it descriptions?"
5,The Ties that Bind,"Exelent book! It may have been the weirdest of all the Jedi Apprentice books, but exelent. I didn't follow throguh, they get a little vague(if it's a typo, please excuse me)in some parts, and Oui-Gon sortta doesn't show his Paddawan that he cares about the mission that much. Still, I think it is one of the best. Well, I think they are all good exept for the first, which was by a different author(Dave Wolverton). I think that was good too, but not as good as the others."
4,good,"this book is probably the most ""confusing"" and exciting of jude's set. i enjoyed it very much but i have to say that the relationship between quigon and obi-wan is worrying. quigon seems not to care about obi-wan less and less, rather than get more and more close. however,i think this book is well written, (good work jude!) and i agree with some other reviews that obi-wan should get a ""girl friend""! hee hee"
2,"Um, where'd Obi-Wan go?","I dunno, I suppose that there just wasn't enough of Obi-Wan in this book to please me. Jedi Apprentice books are about the apprentice, not the affairs of a master. Obi-Wan just sort of sat back and let Qui-Gon control over the whole situation when he was completely out of his mind in love with Tahl.Anyway, I personally think that Obi-Wan is the neatest character I've read about in a book (or seen in a movie). And there just wasn't enough of him. It's more fun when he is doing it all! I'd love to see this awsome padawan take complete control, help everyone, and sort out all of the problems... Just let Qui-Gon see to his honey. Or something not so predictable. Maybe Obi-Wan gets captured but the captors get more than they bargined for! And then Qui-Gon feels bad for ignoring him and doting on Tahl. possibley.Jus' gotta say - bring Obi-Wan back into the picture soon! PLEASE!!!"
3,Not up to Watson's usual standards,"I am nearly 40, so I can't speak for the supposed readership of this series (although I bet there are a LOT of you out there like me), but I found this one disappointing. I'd love to hear what the 9-12 year olds say.Go to http://www.echostation.com/books/jediapp.htm for a good, comprehensive review of the Jedi Apprentice books."
4,Airclick remote control for iPod Mini,"Works perfectly. Good for putting the iPod in your pocket while walking around shopping, or controlling the iPod while driving.The only downside is it does not work with the iTrip because both use the slot next to the earphone jack."
4,Ahead of its time,"The RF transmitter on this thing was solid.Only problem was it constantly drained the ipods battery, the emmbedded electronics didnt have a very good low power 'sleep' mode..."
2,LEAK,"After a few weeks of use, one of the tanks is leaking. The humidistat (such as it is) is prone to mood swings. I will be replacing this and avoiding Clairion."
1,"No tank handles, Cranky humidistat","Overall, I was very disappointed with this humidifier, and have ordered a replacement from a different brand.The tanks are more difficult to fill then they should be. The design of the tanks is that the handle is on the top, and the fill is on the bottom. That means that there is no convenient place to hold the tank while filling.When you wash the outside, make sure the entire center column is dry. Otherwise water seeps into the humidistat, and the humidifier will not function for a day or two until it dries. Other models place the humidistat safely away from water.The humidistat on my unit gets less sensitive over time, so the humidifier does not come on. I have to unscrew the unit and shim the controls. Clairion has not responded to an online service request.For a $90 premium humidifier, I suggest considering other units. I especially like a Holmes humidifier, with a digital humidistat."
2,"Nice design, but VERY NOISY","Overall, a well designed unit - 3 gallon water capacity, very easy to clean (tanks and vaporizing unit all remove easily). Unfortunately, this unit is VERY NOISY - extremely distracting even when in the far corner of my 500 sq ft room. So noisy I had to send it back. While I applaud the excellent design in terms of water capacity and cleaning, I'd never recommend this unit because of the noise level."
2,Good humidity but too loud and awkward,"I was happy with this humidifiers performance in regards to how quickly it humidifies the room, however it was very noisy and difficult to fill. Another reviewer reported that the humidistat is very cranky, which is accurate. Sometimes it will go for a day or two without working because of a damp humidistat. I would not recommend this unit, especially for the cost. I understand that Clarion no longer makes this model anyway!"
2,Humidistat is a REAL problem,"I did extensive research to find a sanitary, easy-to-clean, well-designed large humidifier. I was extremely pleased with my purchase for ONE week! What a terrible design flaw! Turns out my hassle-free humidifier is a piece of junk! Next time I'll read customer reviews!!"
5,Thank You!!,"To the Author: Thanks for saving my sanity. I finally have some answers.I've been loving and yet completely puzzled over someone my entire life. I'm finally finished trying to neatly cram a world of dysfunction, into a diagnosis of an Avoidant- a diagnosis which kept falling short. I finally have some peace of mind.To prospective Readers: Do yourself a favor and read this book!!"
4,The Passive Aggressive Man - change the name and it's someone you know,"This book provided an indepth look at the passive-aggressive male, his traits, and the reasons behind what he does.It gives tips for dealing with their behaviour to try and keep sane (which is almost impossible with a P-A)."
4,All of these are my story,"The book showed me that I needed to get away, far away from my PA husband, they are heartless people. I was married to one for 12 years and still dealing with the craziness because we have two children. They can't be reasoned with, PA will keep you confused, I was, My ex-husband would tell me he loved me, called me all the time at work. But when we were home together he was always avoid me. This list is so long with the thing he would do, I felt like I was the going crazy Sick... Just today he called, starting talking about something he knew would make me upset, and once he seen I was getting upset he said okay, and got off the phone, he got what he wanted, to make me upset. I'm mad at myself becasuse I still falling for his crazy stuff."
5,A life changing book!,"If you have ever had a conversation with someone and afterward you thought to yourself that you have no idea what this conversation accomplished then you are dealing with a passive-aggressive person... They will make you feel as if you are the crazy person and they are just fine. Once you learn how to identify a ""PA"" personality, you will improve your life in ways that will amaze you. This book is a must read even if you aren't dealing with a PA man. Your work place could be passive-aggressive or anyone in your life, male or female. If you feel like you are going ""Nowhere"" and the people closest to you make you feel as if you can't do something, you NEED to read this book."
3,"Good reference, not practical for anything else","As someone who has a P-A husband, I thought this book was going to be great-It is a good reference. If you are looking for general info on PA this book is for you.The drawback is, it offers divorce as an option- which is not an option for me with my Christian viewpoint- so that alone made me not want to continue the book.For someone who thinks divorce might be OK this book is great!!"
2,disappointed,The subject matter was interesting but the book failed to focus in on the topic. The book rattled on and I found myself skimming and never finding anything concrete
2,yea but who does it help,"I'd think about buying this book for some personal issues but all I read about in reviews is how it helps women deal with pa men/husband/bosses, etal.It might even help the pa male recognize himself. But if it even does accomplish that does it help him work through them or just make him feel worse for his efforts to understand himself?Pls don't forget; the pa was a victim (imposed on by others)of his OWN pa for years before you were the ""incidental victim"". He/She has had to struggle with not only his/her own internal problems but with the world he neither understands nor where he is understood.I can find NOTHING for men OR women who want to work through some pa tendencies (not necessarily full-blown papd). Can anyone recommend this book or another RECENT book for those of us who are NOT the victim but the unintentional victimizer?"
5,This book is amazing,"I stumbled across this book while searching the Internet for possible reasons why a relationship that was so important to me was failing miserably. This book is amazing. It describes in explicit detail the causes and behaviors of the passive aggressive (man) in this case. It is an absolute must read for anyone involved in a relationship with a pa. It gives clear cut suggestions on how to look for the signs, and how to deal with this type of person. It is very easy to understand and read. Understanding gives you a lot of power, and this book does just that. I liked it so much it fact, I wrote the author and thanked him for addressing this problem with such empathy and understanding for the partner of the pa."
4,AND NOT JUST MEN EITHER!,"I found the book really helpful. I did though, have to change the pronouns quite often. The passive-aggressive behaviors describe women as well. Scott Wetzler says there are p/a women, but the book describes male behaviors because passive aggression in men seems to be rapidly increasing in the population, both in numbers and in severity of response. From what I've seen, that's true of women as well. If the passive-aggressive personality in your life is female, do not let the title put you off. Simple change in the gender of the pronouns is all you need to see HER behavior very clearly.Peace, DV"
5,(No Longer!) Living With the Passive-Aggressive Man,"This is simply the very best resource I have for my women clients who are struggling to determine whether they are insane or imagining their misery or if they really are ""victims"" of their partners' abusive behavior. Having been the spouse of one of these types of men for 17 years -- and getting absolutely nowhere in marital counseling with him -- I accepted my fate and moved on. I discovered this book by accident one night at a bookstore where, to my utter surprise and delight, it literally fell off the shelf in front of me. My guardian angel knew exactly what I needed to see, and I cannot thank Dr. Wetzler enough for helping me make sense of my insane marriage. This is MUST reading for anyone wondering ""is it me, or am I just imagining . . ."" I hand this book to clients who also find it to be the most direct message to their own part in keeping the games going, and how to get out and STAY OUT of this trap!!"
4,It was good!,"It was a great book. It helped me understand where my husband was coming from. It also taught me about myself. But in the end no matter what I did and no matter how much I changed my way of dealing with it, it was too late. The hurt and anger has been building up for years. I know now how to deal with people like this from the start and to see it a mile away. Dealing with the emotional rollar coaster of this disorder is intense. The book talked a lot about why they are the way they are and it fit my husband to a T. It also talked about the bedroom, which also described my husban to a T. It's sad. If they aren't willing to go to counseling... Run!"
5,Great book...!,"This book helped me to be the one to stay three steps ahead of the mind games, and counter act the nonsense."
3,Living With Passive-Agressive Man,"Poorly explained and difficult to read. THe author writes in a way that take so long to get to the point. Also, like he never put women as a passive agressive people. This is wrong."
5,Finally learned what I've been dealing with for over 3 decades!,"For over 3 decades I have asked myself, ""What is going on?"" After reading this book I finally realized what I have been dealing with all these years. Understanding can lead to healing and I praise God for that!"
3,Passive Man (not so aggressive),"This is a good book for somebody living with a passive man who hides his feelings. I saw the definition of a Passive Aggressive Man given by Dr. Brian Doyle of Georgetown University on a talk show. The definition included the following: the man/woman is seen as the ""nice guy"" by the outside world but within his/her spousal relationship is often verbally abusive or in conflict. One who procrastinates, one who blames others.... The book fails to spend enough effort addressing the very important issues of how the aggression manifests. Patricia Evans book The Verbally Abusive Relationship was a much better read for somebody looking for the ""nice guy"" who isn't so nice when nobody is around (but doesn't physically abuse). Living With The Passive Aggressive Man is a good book for the couple that is dealing with a man who is on the passive side."
4,A Trip Down Mammary Lane...,"This book is a fine review of Playboy magazine's 50-year history of ground-breaking photography. Not just the Playmates--though there are plenty here, but also the cars, the clothes, the music and the lifestyle that were part and parcel of the Playboy mythos are well-represented. The farther back you yourself go in Playboy's history, the more you will enjoy this book. My only regret is that it should have been a much longer book. There were millions of photographic images considered for publication; many more of them would have been even more welcome."
1,Pictures of Pictures,"For a photographic book, i was expecting better quality pictures. To me, most of the pictures look like ""pictures of pictures"". if you expect the high quality crisp images and excellent color quality images of Playboy, i think you will be disappointed. I am."
4,Artistic and interesting.,Photos represent different tastes in styles and expressions from subjects in years past. Good coffee table book for starting conversation during parties.
5,Classic,"Can't Imagine not going to the Newsracks&Not seeing Playboy. It's been Part of My life for a long time.I Loved this Magazine big time.always kept a big ole stash.all those fine Beautiful Ladies would have me all dizzy&Knocked out,funny thing was:I wasn't even drunk. the Sight of Beautiful Ladies looking so Hot&whatnot just left me under a spell.seeing Racquel Welch(who is still very Hot) still warms up my room.Great Photos&Memorys. Props always to the Man Hugh Hefner for making it all happen."
3,"Not the same ""Victor Rudik"" who wrote ""The One Inch Army""!","Note that this is NOT by the same ""Victor Rudik"" who wrote ""The One Inch Army"" and ""The One Inch Army II"".It's by his father, who worked on creating the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act."
4,Gutwrenching!!,"This is an inspiring and truly compelling account of events as told by Col. Sam Grashio. I was at once shocked, proud and amazed at what was chronicled in this book I would recommend this book to anyone looking to find the actual truth about events that took place in the Pacific Theater during WWII. Col. Grashio writes from memory and therefore a few sketchy areas are encountered, but overall he does an excellent job of detailing times, places and people. Read it, remember, and never forget."
5,"Nearly...Never, Never Land",I have other CD's by this group and I don't think one could be disappointed with anything from them!! This is great for relaxtion and even better for intimate times with your loved one.
2,Rather disappointed,"I was expecting music that is uplifting and lively, this is very mellow and sullen. I have been listening to different celtic music on [...] and came accross a song titled ""Hibernia"" performed by Michael W. Smith and that is excellent. If this is the story of Ireland, then that must be very sad. Not a CD that I recommend."
3,Bad interview good artwork,"A 20 min interview in england during the ACS tour the packaging is nice (photos and free guitar pick) but the interview is kinda bad, it was windy in the cafe where they had the interview and about half of the interview you cant hear but manson answers some good questions: like what ""Smells Like Children"" means"
1,Not child-friendly,I bought this product expecting that it would promote appetite in my child. The product is not child-friendly as neither the taste nor the smell appeal to the child. My child would rather take food than take this product and maybe that's the way the product was meant to promote appetite.
1,Doesn't work on linux,"Says it supports 2.4.x or higher but that isn't the case if you are using RHEL5. Contacted techsupport and to there credit they answered super quick but it took a long time to say yea it should work, but then it was well we only support what's in the README and we don't have much info for Linux. I'll go with Intel and not have the problems and get a better card."
1,A big disappointment.,"When I initially heard of The Secret, I was intirgued by the way the subject of the Byrons' marriage was approached by the author. I thought that Ashley Hay would bring a new perspective to the subject. Instead, it is a rehash, in which Lord Byron is portrayed as the misunderstood genius abandoned by his prim and severe wife, except told in a postmodern fashion. Her conclusion is that the Lady Byron's ""secret"" is in the eye of the beholder.In one word -trite."
1,Garbage,"I thought I was going to be in for some light entertainment with the odd chuckle. Sorry, didn't happen. I have to sum this book up as complete garbage. It only gets a one star because there's no lower ranking you can give."
1,Amusing at First....,"The first 30 pages were pretty funny, some even make you laugh out loud, but after reading about three-quarters of it, I had enough. It began to seem redundant and boring. I wouldn't spend the money.Go out to lunch instead."
5,A fine choice in any regard,"Economic thinking, just like any other school of thought, has had its own evolution over the years. ""The Trend of Economic Thinking: Essays on Political Economists and Economic History"" is a collection of essays from renown economic scientist F.A. Hayek chronicling the ideas of one of the best economic minds fo the twentieth century. His essays discuss the past history of economics from the times of Adam Smith, to his own contemporary times where capitalism and communism were at each others throats at every front. A must read for any economics student or simply one who wants a better grasp of how money works in the world, ""The Trend fo Economic Thinking"" is a fine choice in any regard."
4,Great detailed source,"Zagorin's book is the most detailed popular treatment of the early days of the English Revolution that I have read. In addition to his broader analysis, he gives a day-by-day history of key developments in the first year or so of revolution. He also devotes pages to the structure and functioning of London's civic government and to the outbreaks of popular protest in London, which other authors gloss over.The only negative is his anti-leftist bias, which keeps him from grasping the broader ""incipient capitalist'"" elements of the revolution -- the rationalization of government, the trading classes demanding a voice in foreign policy, etc.I was sad when I finished this book."
2,Boring,"All these songs drag on for 4-5 minutes each, and never get pass slow tempos. The music is boring too although the lyrics are quite good. Still yet, it doesn't save the music. The last song is gets pass the mid tempo range, but the drum beat is off, which ruined the whole song. Save your money for something else."
2,Small book,This was a very small book of short quotes from Indians. It was mildly interesting but not as inspirational as I thought it would be.
5,Good quality for the price,"Exactly what I needed to distribute some homemade cocktail bitters to friends for Christmas, and much cheaper per unit than others available. Came quickly even during Christmas shipping season. Wish the glass dropper was a little longer so it reached deeper in the bottle, but otherwise worked out great."
3,All glass but one was broken,"In terms of the product itself, both the bottle and dropper were made out of glass as described online. I was disappointed to find that one of the bottle was broken. It really didn't help that the product was shipped to me in plastic packaging. The plastic packaging was lined with bubble wrap; however, there was still a lot of loose space between the bottles, which, of course, would make it very easy for the bottles to break while being shipped. There wasn't even anything on the outside of the packaging that said ""fragile,"" so I'm sure my package got tossed around a lot. I'm surprised only one broke."
2,"Glass bottles, plastic droppers!!","The picture of this item shows glass bottles and glass droppers. However, the droppers are very cheap plastic, which completely makes this item unacceptable. Why would anyone sell a glass dropper bottle with plastic droppers? Buyer beware."
2,Book Review,"The artwork is lovely but the rhyme seemed forced and a bit abrupt at the end. Try Leo Lionni's, A Color of his own or Eric Carle's, Mixed Up Chameleon for a better story."
4,It's just how you do it.,"At first glance I was not very impressed with this but I gave it a chance. My three-year-old twin girls kept asking for it--every night. Yes, one reviewer said the rhyme scheme seems forced. You can't let yourself force it to fit; an equal number of syllables in each sentence is really not necessary for good rhyming. You just have to work it. The illustrations are very cohesive to my girls' taste (Pixar-ish)and the colors are VIBrant! My library book is due back in a week and I HAVE to buy this one..."
2,Be careful...,"(I'm using my mom's account for this review.)The product is alright, but I just want to warn anybody who's considering buying this. If you got here by searching ""Leon Kennedy"", you may be disappointed. I purchased this item for my boyfriend hoping to get a figure of Leon, but I ended up getting some random zombie instead. It wasn't until then that I realized that the title of the product had nothing to do with Leon. So, if you're looking for a specific figure, you may be disappointed with your reslts."
4,Fun if your willing to take a chance.,"First off, be advised that these are blind packaged trading figures. Dont be fooled by Leon being on the box. These figures are totally random and you will recieve 1 out of 7 per box (one of which is a secret figure). They seem nicely made and quite sturdy compared to other trading figures I've seen. If your a big fan of Resident Evil and arent afraid of making a gamble, then these are great. They would also make a very nice gift for any zombie loving friends."
3,RE action figure,"My son originally looked this figure up, however, he neglected to read the fine print that said it was a random figure. He thought he was going to get the character shown. I think it should have been advertised up front as a ""mystery box"". However, he loves it anyway."
5,Great collectors piece,Very in-expensive product for the younger Resident Evil lover..Great for any pre-teen to start off their collection.
5,"Barbara Dickson singing Lennon, McCartney et al","A delightful musical excursion into the music of both mine and the artist's youth. Dickson's voice holds up beautifully and she can ""act"" a song as well as sing it in a truly heartfelt way. Her dramatic ""Eleanor Rigby"" is a real gem. She injects new life into these songs, or, to state it better, reinvogorates them with the life that was always there.mitchell"
1,No steam,"Got this to get a tiny amount of steam once...never again. When I called the company they told me it would cost me $50 to fix it (more then I paid!) Just cut my losses and threw it away...I was sad, but I'll just have to get a bigger, higher quality one!"
4,Post punk at it's best.,"this album strays away from the group's first punk oriented album. This one is much like fugazi, except even more melodic. Songs like U.S.A for Matthew, Queen of the day, and breaking skin are the greatest examples of melody. No real hard hitting songs, but the guitars and drums can be fast and hard when they need to be. The lyrics on this album also show more maturity, and the whole musical style is really different. If you are a fan of post punk or early emo styles like fugazi and quicksand, you should get this album."
3,Canadian 'Toni' is the Best,"Well what is there to say about Virtual Freedom. Mr. Kane tells a story of oppressed students in an oppressed town. Every one is being brought down by the man. Too much hippie crack in this book. Characters are alright though. Enjoyable enough to keep reading. I have to give it a 3 because I actually read it (first person after friends,family and students)."
5,Classic TP and the HBs,"This is Tom Petty in classic form. Maybe not as classic as the ""Wildflowers"" album but very close. Petty seems to get better with age and he proves it again here. There are no negatives with this album. Witty lyrics, jangling guitars, Hammond B-3 organ, Mike Campbell guitar hero leads. It's what the Heartbreakers have been doing for 25 years. It's sad that there is no radio format for great music like this. Instead we get low-quality, sound alike, Britney/Back Street/INSYNC fuzz. This is basically the the theme of this album.Tom Petty will tour this fall and will probably sing a majority of these songs. That should tell you how these songs stack up with the classics he's produced."
2,Some good lyrics but indifferent music.,"There are some good lyrical moments on this CD (the lite beer lines and shots at record company moguls), but the music drags them down. I've never heard this group sound so boring. Only ""Joe"" and the instrumental jam at the end of ""Lost Children"" did anything for me. It made me wonder what an artist like Iggy Pop would have done with some of these lyrics. A lot more than Tom Petty did, I would think."
4,Classic Petty,"I just bought the album, and gave it a run through. If you are new to Petty, it would be wise to first buy Full Moon Fever, Into the Great Wide Open, or Wildflowers. These albums are some of his best work and will give you a greater appreciation for his music. If you're a seasoned Petty fan, then you should have already placed your order!I'd also recommend the special DVD edition. The DVD has 7 live music sessions with Petty and the Heartbreakers. For a couple dollars more, it's a steal.The best way to sum up the album is just another good Petty album."
3,Disappointing Petty,"This is hard to write. Tom Petty, with or without Heartbreakers, is one of the greats in rock. Any album of his is noteworthy, when compared with the vast majority of issues in the last thirty years. That said, for Petty, this is a stinker. I found forced lyrics, a moral point of view based at approximately age 13, and virtually no fun on the entire album. The greed and venality of the music industry is no secret. I wish that Tom's anger had found more eloquent, more satirical, and more mature expression. Song was a large part of the civil rights movement, and I believe it can be a powerful force for change. I don't think anyone is going to be singing any of the songs on this album in five years."
5,if you dont buy it you aint gonna hear it......dont miss out,Simply put this cd is great....not gonna complicate my review with alot of reasons other than the simple love of music that is fed by this new cd from Tom Petty. It is Tom Petty in classic form here.....So buy it if you want to hear it because this one wont be getting any air play....
3,More Like 3.5 Stars!,"This is one of Petty's better albums with his take on the whole corporate pop music scene currently going on. The catchy lead-off title track ""The Last DJ"" was inspired by KLOS DJ Jim Ladd. ""Money Becomes King"", my personal favorite from the album, talks about how money has taken over music in today's music scene. ""Dreamville"", ""Lost Children"", ""The Man Who Loves Women"", ""Have Love Will Travel"" & ""Joe"" are also other notable tracks.Overall, if a Petty fan, then this is a must. If you're simply a casual Petty fan then you might want to check it out and be pleasantly surprised!"
2,Run of the Mill,This is a disappointing collection. Almost as if old Tom's running out of ideas. Nothing on the disk really stands out. In fact I've only listened to the entire cd twice (the second time was a chore). I love the guy normally but he's got to do better than this.
3,very average,"Man, this was a letdown. I heard some of the new songs during his summer 2002 tour, and thought they had potential. When I got the album, it just sounded....average. Lyrics were annoying, complaining too much about the industry. They seemed kind of ""cheesy"". The tunes didn't rock like I had hoped, and seemed very basic and simple. I hate to admit it, but this one ended up in the used bin of my local cd shop."
2,Tommy's tired,"OK. I'm a Petty fan from way back (I saw him live in Austin on the ""Damn The Torpedos"" tour in '79) and I'm a ""can't do anything wrong"" fan. Having said that, this one just rubs me the wrong way. The title cut and ""Kid Goes Bad"" are vintage Petty. The rest is average stuff at best. I'm reminded of Zappa's ""Joe's Garage"". I get the message, but the music is just not getting me.I've seen him do most of the record live and unfortunately, it fails live as well.Look, I am an ultimate Petty fan. But we'd have to go a long way back to find an effort so disappointing. It's time for some kind of mix of r and r classics and acoustic Petty orgiginals.The Compaq Arena (Houston) was half empty this past weekend.""The Last DJ"" may well be the ""last stand""'. I really hope not. I was there when the boy was by far, the best in the business."
4,Last DJ,"The Last DJthe latest by tom petty & the heartbreakers finds them at the top of theirmusical game with some truly inspired playing throughout this disc. thepower ballads ""dreamville"" and ""have love will travel"" are particular standouts that start mellow and blow it out by the end. the anti-corporate rants show that petty still has the teeth which spit out ""jammin' me"" a few years back. check out this disc and see the guys in concert when they comearound."
4,Great,"Tom Petty did it again! This is a great album sure a couple of tracks aren't rock solid, but Petty is still making hits. One of the best ever."
3,A Disappointing Effort,"I gave the CD two stars because there are about 3 or 4 good songs on the record. ""Can't stop the sun"" is great, ""Have love will travel"" is great, ""The Last DJ"" is good, ""The Man Who Loves Women"" is good but that's about it. I'm 23 years old and I love me some Tom Petty, but these lyrics are lame! I know it's a concept album, but the lyrics and the music just don't have the weight to back up the concept. Overall, this is boring album, with few highlights, especially when compared to Tom Petty's last few albums, the underrated ""Echo"" and the intimacy of ""Wildflowers"". ""She's the One"" is a very entertaining and classy record. I just hope that Tom and The Heartbreakers get a chance to redeem themselves with another record. To me, Tom doesn't sound angry, he sounds like he needs some inspiration. ""When Money Became King"", ""Joe"", and ""Dreamville"" are repetitive and in my opinion, boring and kind of cheesy songs. I can't really recall the rest of the songs, which speaks for itself."
2,Let's Hope This Slump Doesn't Last,"THE LAST DJ only gets 2 stars because the lyrics are so depressing. Petty's previous slingshots at the music industry (a line in the title song from INTO THE GREAT WIDE OPEN, for instance) seemed to convey a sense of defiant independence, but here, Petty just seems to sound cynical and nasty, without any idea of a remedy for the problem of music-biz greed and corruption. The previous inspirational lyrics (""Refugee"" and ""Even The Losers"" from DAMN THE TORPEDOES and ""I Won't Back Down"" from FULL MOON FEVER are wondrous examples) have, sadly, been replaced by mean-spirited hopelessness that cannot be mitigated by his advocacy of sanctions against Indonesia in the wake of that country's trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction against a young Australian tourist. It turns out that Petty is releasing a new album at the end of this year or the beginning of next, so let's hope it's less cynical and more hopeful than this one."
1,"Sorry, other than the song: ""The Last DJ"", this album is bad","This album is soooooo boring! There are maybe 2 songs worth listening to. I just bought the CD about 2 hours ago and just listed it on Amazon Marketplace to get rid of it. It is just NOT a good album. I usually like Tom Petty's stuff and I think he is an amazing musician, but maybe he should stick to solo stuff or more rock and roll songs. He is great live, but this album is just not good."
3,3 GOOD SONGS,"I hope tom petty doesn't waste these 3 great songs on this weak album forever. The songs "" HAVE LOVE, WILL TRAVEL -,YOU AND ME-,LIKE A DIAMOND "". Please MR.PETTY use these 3 song's for a HIT's collection. There to good for this album. Don't waste 3 great song's SAME THING for The song's "" THIS OLD TOWN,BIG WEEKEND,SQAURE ONE "", off your new album. Some people may Like ""SAVING GRACE""---but most of my friends agree----""IT JUST DOESN""T SOUND LIKE PETTY or HIS STYLE""...........to be on a great hits collection 2."
2,subpar,"I have to agree that this is a sub-par performance from Tom, which is a pity given the cynical subject matter. The tunes are simply not memorable, especially the ballads. Surely the best revenge against the peurile ""tastemakers"" is to make and be successful with really great music, instead of this mediocre collection. ...- so to cry about the proliferation of pop junk is spearing a well-worn paper tiger. Maybe it's to cover Tom's lack of inspiration....."
3,"tom fails to surpass himself, but at least gives it a shot","i believe most tom petty fans agree that this band will never be what they used to be. that said, the heartbreakers and tom have tried hard enough on this album.although 4 out of 12 songs are about the music industry and the monstrosity it has become, tom has a right. do you not agree that artists are so easy to make these days, so simple, and yet they rake in everything under the sun? i wish more people would jam to tom petty and forget avril lavigne.the best songs on this album are ""dreamville,"" ""when a kid goes bad"" (the closest song to the old heartbreakers), ""like a diamond,"" ""blue sunday"" (awesome lyrics, if i do say so myself), ""have love will travel,"" and ""can't stop the sun."" this really is a good album, just not as good as everyone knows tom petty can do.<..."
4,Something different from TP,"Tom petty has taken his usual country style and interwoven new themes to create a truly magnificent rock album.Fans of prog rock will recognise echoes of some of the great concept albums, represented here in the subtle use of orchestration and keyboards, which has created a wave on which bleeding guitars and gritty vocals send a shiver down your spine.Each track stands alone but it is best listened to end to end as the story unfolds the tale of a man with heart and soul is slowly ground away by the corporate machine. There are some comedy moments and at the end, the journey tends to uplift you rather than depress.Artistically, this CD deserves a place alongside acclaimed albums by The Moody Blues and Pink Floyd Definitely more prog than raw rock, but with shorter tracks and less orchestration.Pour yourself a large drink and listen to this one with the lights down low. It is not like his earlier work."
2,A Cynical CD,"This is really a cynical album. ""The music business sucks"" is hardly a compelling theme for a rock n' roll album. Who wants to crank up their stereo to the sound of Petty's whining? What's sad is that this is the same guy who once gave us songs like ""Won't Back Down"" and ""Runnin Down a Dream"" and ""Out in the Cold."" Why is Tom so angry now? The music business has treated him royally. It must be that Hollywood liberal guilt getting to him. Now Tom, please get over the fact that Al Gore lost the election and do something GOOD next time."
3,black/thrash,"This album may not my ""cup o' tea,"" but for fans of underproduced Black/Thrash metal it would be good. Standout track is Troops of Doom (which, BTW can be found in various formats on may Sepultura releases)."
5,Tracks,Track Listings1. San Antonio Rose2. Seven Lonely Days3. Your Cheatin' Heart4. Lovesick Blues5. Walking After Midnight6. Foolin' 'Round7. Half As Much8. I Fall To Pieces9. Crazy10. Blue Moon Of Kentucky11. She's Got You12. Sweet Dreams
4,Montreal Steak Seasoning,"I've been using this product for years now. I use it in all kinds of foods and it really is out of this world good, but you really need to be mindful of the amount of salt in it, as I've used it in sauces and it was way too salty. In the much smaller containers they have 40% reduced salt versions, which is what I use in my sauces now. I just wish the reduced salt variety came in a 28 ounce container - I seem to go through a lot of this seasoning, because I use it very often. Wonderful product, though. It's kind of my secret ingredient - couldn't cook without it!"
5,More Great Music,"Superlatives aside, this release does a great job of documenting one of the Dead's high points. This release is for completists and/or those already familiar with the '72 sound. For me, this is a great time capsule. I love the idea of having these performances committed to CD so that they will stand up against anything rock produces in the coming years. The sound is clean and alive, and crackles with energy. One small question: Dennis McNally in his recent bio of the band mentions how they got Merl Saunders to overdub organ tracks on the original ""Europe '72"" release, I just hope it's really Pigpen on these tracks, as mentioned in the liner notes, b/c it sure is some beautiful playing (i.e. the Other One) and I love the fact that even though he was very ill Pig was pumping that organ in the background, filling every nook and cranny with some sweet soul."
5,AWESOME! One of the BEST DEAD releases!,"It doesnt get any better than the EUROPE 1972 tour for the Grateful Dead. Keith is full of vigor and virtuosity, Pigpen is still burnin', Jerry is coming into his mature jazziness, and Bobby is one of a kind and at his peak. Together with Billy...who is as important as any other member is setting the pace and direction the sum is even greater than the priceless ingredients! 1972 thru 1974 are the BEST years for DEAD. 1979 thru 1982 for Brent and fuller setlists. 1989 for Drums adventures."
4,Big fan of 1972 era Grateful Dead,"I love Europe '72, it is one of my favorite Grateful Dead live albums. Steppin' Out continues that great vibe. Highly recommend this CD if you too appreciate Dead music from this period. I give Europe '72 five stars and this collection 2nd best with four stars."
2,Actually a 9 inch shower arm..,"I ordered this because the item description said it was 18.9 inches long. It arrived...only 9 inches. The package it comes in doesn't even measure 18.9 inches, so I'm not sure where that number came from. Just so you know before you buy! :)"
2,"Dead after 2 years, 45 minutes per day","I think it should have lasted at least 5 years. Considering that I've always been very gentle with it, never dropped it, even 5 years is too young to die.But then, I'm old school..."
2,Falls short for professional musician,"I bought this metronome because unlike many others, this metronome makes a clicking noise (like the original metronomes that has weights) instead of the annoying beeps. I was excited to get this because in the other reviews it says that it's loud enough, but the only draw back is the small blinking light. I received it, and immediately started to practice, and I wasn't even on a grand piano but my large upright totally drowned out the clicks, it was just way too quiet and there's no volume control volume so I was stuck with it. the light is also small, but not impossible to follow, the only problem with light is that it usually makes you delay just a little bit. So, yes, this metronome would be good if you have a digital keyboard, or perhaps a quieter instrument like acoustic guitar but to all the pianists, violinists, wind players, you will not be able to hear anything out of this metronome."
3,matrix MR500 metronome,This metronome has a nice big sound but I have two problems with it:1. the blinking light doesn't work--doesn't even come on. And this was a BRAND NEW metronome!!2. It is very hard to manipulate one-handed--the on/off button is hard to find and manage unless you pick it up and use two hands.
5,good for the money,This is a nice metronome if one doesn't want the wind-up kind. Bought itfor my music major daughter who had to hear it over the piano.
1,Broken in 6 months,This metronome started to beat very fast no matter how you adjust it. Very low quality one. Will never use it.
4,Great for young students!,"My daughter's piano instructor suggested this make/model of metronome. It's small, compact and can be taken anywhere. My daughter has been playing piano since she was five, she's eleven now. I noticed a major change in her timing after one week with the metronome. An excellent buy!"
1,Broke in less than 2 weeks,I purchased this metronome less than 2 weeks ago and already it's broken. It clicks only at a very rapid tempo regardless of what setting I choose. And it does not play an A 440 - there's no sound at all when I turn the dial there. How hard could it be to design a metronome? Avoid this one.
2,Matrix MR-500 metronome,"I've recommended two of these to piano students who had to return them because they're not loud enough to be heard when playing the piano. I don't recommend this metronome for piano students, especially if you want to play duets."
1,can't hear the beat,The sound is way too soft you can't hear it at all while playing on the piano. Not recommend! I returned it right away!!
2,No longer clicks but beeps,I've been using this style metronome for years because:- I'm hard on metronomes and this one is cheap enough to replace frequently- It produces an actual click instead of beepThey must have changed something because the one I just ordered beeps instead of clicks. It's very distracting and I'm really disappointed.
4,Just What We Wanted,"I liked this metronome because it was just loud enough and the flashing red light helps me to stay on beat too. What was also nice was it came with an earbud to plug into the metronome so if you were having trouble with hearing the beat, you could hear it better."
4,Matrix MR500 Metronome,"Well, what can I say. This is a basic unit and it works. Sounds is not an annoying beep (more like a click) and it does what I need. Use it for practicing my timing. Definitely a good choice for my basic need."
1,Smoking,"I tried to install the battery, and when I turned it on, instead of making any noise, it started to smoke! I'm getting another brand next time."
5,Not Just Northern Cheyenne Blues,Cheyenne Blue touches the soul of anyone who listens. I find it both humorous and thought provking at the same time. Although my favorites are 'It Wasn't Me' and 'Cheyenne Blue' I continue to listen to the CD in it's entirety becaue the other cuts provide their own unique characteristics including honesty and sensuality. I loved the CD the first time I heard it and my appreciation continues to grow everytime I play it.
3,only suitable for small children,The hat is lovely but far too small for any adult or child over the age of 9.
5,Great club tune. Will be danicng to it come Saturday night,Armand is a great mixer of club hits. The great 1 Funk Phenomena is the greatest club tune of all time. When i hear that tune my feet just dont wanta stop. He has appearently outdone himself this time with 2 Future 4 you. I am sure it will skyrocket up the charts... I had to special order his most recent cd....but it was well worth the wait Go Armand.......go...keep pumping them out.
4,Highly recommended,"This is an excellent mix, with a very interesting beat- next to flowerz, AVH's best single that I have heard. But perhaps AVH wants to orient himself slightly towards another (NY) DJ, Mik Nate' in some of his other, heavier compilations."
4,Very informative book,This book is very in formative and the format is much like an encylopedia in the fact that you can find the information that you're looking for very easily and quickly. It's also very detailed in it's descriptions of the various people. Highly recommended for anyone who is trying to learn Egyptian mythology.
2,not impressed,"This is a superb book...for junior high or high school students. Yes, it is easy to read, but I found the highlighted words in the text (to indicate they are in the glossary) to be a nuisance. The authors over-simplify everything and attempt to encompass too many areas of the broad field, so it will only be of use to readers who have never seen CSI or know absolutely nothing about forensic science. Saferstein's introductory book on forensic science would be a better choice for your money."
5,ronnie in half-shadow,"this was the first Joy Electric CD I ever bought, (a risk, since i had never heard their music) and it was love at first listen. both re-mixes of ""drum machine joy"" are better than the original, and this album's mix of ""girl from rosewood lane"" will always hold a mistygreen place in my heart. the final track, ""five stars for failure"" would make even the smiths proud of its melancholy tones. an album for Christians who acknowledge life to be oftentimes hard, cold, and sad-- but far from hopeless, for the Saviour lives."
4,Queen of the Night,"I couldn't disagree more with Miss Snyders rating of Cristina Deutekoms singing. For me, this is by far the most thrilling and impressive rendition of the Queen second aria. The coloratura are crisp and in a murderous tempo. The sound like bell chimes and still have a threatening potential to drive Pamina into dispare. She is the only soprano that doesn't need to adjust speed of make an audible ""gear-change"" between legato and coloratura. As for the rest of the recording, to much Bartoli in an otherwise terrific line-up."
1,Issue with supplier,"I placed an order for this item on November 8th through Warm Things. Despite being told that it was immediately available, I still had not received it by November 18th. On that day, I received a phone call from Warm Things. They assured me that they would send the item via 2-day air at no additional charge to me. On November 19th, I received an email from another Warm Things customer who had erroneously received my order. It is now November 25th and I still have not received my order. Although I cannot comment on the product, I can express my sincere dissatisfaction with the service level of Warm Things."
5,milkshake jones rocks!!,"these guys are the best band since zepplin! they don't rock like zepplin, but i like them as much as zepplin!! they have a unique sound unlike all these other new rockers. buy it!!"
5,a laugh riot!,"well, maybe my title is going a bit too far, but this book has long been one of my favorites. it is not a well known book, despite having had a tv show and movie based on it. i think it is sad, since this collection of stories deserves to be known by all. it is not deep reading, by any means, as the title most assuredly reveals, but it is fun reading, reading that will take your mind off things. the stories in this book are a collection of jean kerr's various magazine articles reflecting on her life, her family, and the always amusing events that surround her. this book may have been written in the fifties, but most of the things she discusses still occur today in everyday life. i recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a lighthearted laugh and a good read. you won't be sorry you took a trip into the garden. (gosh that was a bad pun!)"
5,"""Back Off"" definitely gets creditors to back off...","Without this book, I would still be fuming at those harrassing calls. Instead, I no longer receive such calls and have worked out my repayments to my own benefit, actually saving alot of money by cutting out third-party debt collectors and their inflated charges. An excellent simple book in explaining your rights (Yes, you DO have them!) in regards to collection agencies and repaying debts."
1,Over simplification,"Mr. Dover makes many assumptions, which may not be to ones benefit. Simply telling an agency to cease communication for example may stop the annoying phone call, but may speed a lawsuit in the debtors direction. Silence is not always golden. Be careful, examine your situtations carefully before taking Mr. Dovers advice."
1,Very VIOLENT. Not a children's book!,"We found this book to be VERY VIOLENT. There are several disturbing photographs and sketches that are inappropriate for any child. One of the sections is about Chinese tortures and states ""The 'lightest' penalty was beating - 4 to 100 blows . . might also be condemed to have his ears cut off or be shut inside a tiny cage. The frame torture consisted of placing a piece of wood weighing over 80 pounds around the convict's neck. He was not able to sleep or rest, and the slightest fall could break is neck and kill him."" This is accompanied by a VERY DISTURBING photograph of men and a child being tortured! A children's book?Also, of the many photos, only one is of a woman or girl. She is working in a silk work factory.Overall, my opinion of the book was very negative - especially in its depiction of China and it's people."
4,Goodmovie!,No one can impersonate Bruce Lee like Sammo Hung(Enter Fat Dragon)(Fatty dragon skinny tiger). Bruce Li does a good job though. I really enjoy this film. It's a classic.
3,Does not fit Ram 1500,"Do not buy this if you have a full size pickup. I assumed since it was a Dodge Ram seatcover, it would fit my Ram pickup."
2,DOESN'T FIT.,I have a Dodge Ram 1500. The cover didn't fit at all. It is WAY too small. The headrest covers didn't fit either. It tore as I tried to put it on. Definitely won't work for a full width bench seat. I really sorry I wasted the money. MIGHT work for a small bench seat with separate head rests.
1,IT DOES NOT FIT !!!!!!,"Hi There,The product says clearly for Dodge RAM but unflrtunately it does not fit into the dodge RAM by all meansThat is scamming and unbelievable !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,one of the biggest pieces of garbage i have ever purchased!,"this seat cover should be half the price considering how easily it rips and tears. i guess the dodge logo is what costs so much. and no, this is not universal. if you have a larger bench look elsewhere where they will tell you the width and be sure to measure your bench. im starting to look at covercraft seatcovers which for 20 bucks more, i could have gotten a custom seat cover of better quality. shame on me."
5,very pleased as always.,Shakti Gawain is the greatest in the business for recieving better health and prosperity. I plan too listen to this more often over the wintertime. It is currently october '10 right now.
2,Is this the kind of supervisor you want to be?,"This book offers a very cliched, narrow vision of supervising people that emphasizes power over teamwork, delegation over coordination. Other advice is very commonsensical - ""Make to-do lists,"" etc. It is not a sophisticated analysis, but rather, the transcript of a superficial one-day workshop."
4,A Useful Tool,"I have used this book for years (since the 1990's) and trained hundreds of supervisors with it. As with any tool, it is not the end all for training materials, but a useful adjunct for use with practical experience and common sense. Remember, there was a time when the only things supervisors had to know were planning, organizing, directing and controlling. Today's managers need so much more. This is a very good book to start discussions on those other areas of supervision. Well worth the price and worth keeping as a useful reference."
3,Still Open,"Former Soft Cell singer and creator of several solo records dedicated to Georges Bataille and Jacques Brel, now releases a record on his own Blue Star label, released here in America on Instinct. The torch singer we know is present on a few of the opening tracks like ""Night & Dark"" and ""Tragedy."" Almond has definitely updated his sound, and made an all-around listenable record. Kelli Ali and Siouxie Sioux duet with Marc on certain tracks. Also there are three bonus tracks including the lovely ""Satan's Child."" Almond's palette is both light and dark, and fans of Gavin Friday and Nick Cave should come round to this one. Not his best, but the first good one in a long time.(www.freewilliamsburg.com)"
4,not his best but disc gets better with listening,"ive been a fan of marcs since ""jacky"" when he releases a record its cause of excitement,especially in this country where the question of ""who the hell is marc almond"" is asked.when this disc came out i bought it with no idea what it would be like, the usual brooding sexual contempt masquarading as ballads,the potentially hitmaking dance tracks? the answer, this is not marcs best,it is flat,monotone,gothic almost. the themes ,as always,are darkly sexual. his usual midnight cruise of soho feel. but the hooks and lyrics do catch you overtime and you see the beauty and ugliness in each song. a duet wth siouxie is a standout. this may not be his definitive work ,for that get ""enchanted"",but for now it'll do."
3,It's okay.,"Just okay. Nothing to write home about. The lyrics are kind of overreaching and thereby cringeable and the songs are too similar - after a while I stopped listening. Almond's big gun is certainly his voice - whenever the song isn't interesting I can always listen to his singing. I went for the Almond album to see what he was up to in modern times, but it doesn't seem like he's hiked the heights he hiked with Dave Ball in the past."
2,Cheap Earrings,"Watch out with these. I bought them for my wife and after less than three (3) weeks they started falling apart. The center turquoise is glued on and it just fell off. They are useless now. Also, the picture is somewhat deceptive. The back of the earring is a flat separate piece of plastic and is not connected to the metal part of the earring so it flaps around.These are cheap and fall apart quickly."
2,SHOULD HAVE LISTENED,"Before I purchased these earrings, others had commented on their poor quality. These are cute but not really a very high quality."
3,Bloodsong,dont get me wrong i love Ghost Hunters but i was a bit disaponted that there was only five eposids on this two dvd set
4,Good Read,"I like this book. It was slow at first me though, Jerome is a very good writer never the less. I felt in the beginning of the book he did too much describing. He described everything and the background of EVERY thing, and it just throws the reader off as you wait to find out whats really even going on in the story. BUT once you get past all that, it turns into a wonderful book. The story between the three characters is very oringial and a bit weird. But he tells the story beautifully, and you really feel for the chracters. I definitely recommend!"
1,So disappointing,"I read EJD's Cheaters because of a friend's recommendation and thought the book was okay, but not a classic. I expected that a few books later he would've improved but he hasn't. The first few pages were all right. I liked the reference to Lolita, where both main characters made up thier own realities to suit thier own purposes, but that's just about all I liked. I could't stand Nicole's selfish and immature ways. I don't understand why such a woman as her would bewitch both lovers. I admit, i hate weak characters with a passion and there was enough weak characters in this book to make me ill. Hopefully, the next book will be much better."
2,?????,"I wrote a review last week I had just begun reading this book. Now half way though I am really not impressed with the story. Thecharacters were extremely ""sorry"" there is love and then there is lovin' oneself. I don't believe any of them were able to do that, thus was a story about ""needy"" people..."
3,Not Outstanding!!!,"I just got this book about a week ago I started reading it and I am half way through.. I am not impressed. I actually feel sorry for Nicole's lovers because they really care for her. She isn't a divided soul she is ""Playing"" with them, why because she can...However, if she would pick and start relationship that would be like committing.... and of course there wouldn't be a plot for a book.... I still love Milk in my coffee but this one...aaaaHHH!!"
5,and he does it again,"As a fellow author, I must give my man his props. Between lovers is filled with great dialogue, and an excellent storyline. Eric continues to blaze thru the literary world woth his fantastic and realistic creative story lines, all i can say is keep it up and i am looking forward to his next book."
2,Not what I expected,"I have all of Eric's books and usually really enjoy his writing. However, I was disappointed with Between Lovers. I thought the love scenes were just too much, too often and I thought the writing was somewhat choppy. Seemed like Nicole always spoke in incomplete sentences and I couldn't follow who was talking. The storyline was okay and it did get really intense during the chase scene but I found it difficult to get through and had to force myself to keep reading."
3,It was alright,"I have all of Eric's books, and I loved them. But for some reason I didn't really care too much for this one. I truly didn't care about the whole sexual scenes between the three characters, but it was an ok book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone though, but it's just my opinion. I think Eric could have done a lot better. Especially with the dialogue. The sentences were too short when the characters were talking to each other. I think I gave it a three because I'm a fan of Eric Jerome Dickey's, if I wasn't, I would have given it a 2."
3,bleh! - *revised*,"I didn't like this book, and not because of the content, but because of the way he wrote it.....where is the Milk in my Coffee EJD and the Friends and Lovers....I am appaled!When I started this book my frist reaction was cool!!!!Although I am glad to see a book out there about bisexuality and alternative relationships. Sadly most of the reviews i read were bashing the content not the style. things that make you go hmmm!!!!This is about bisexuality and even polyamory. But the style he used to write this book just didn't seem like his previous books. I found it hard to get into the sotry because of the wording."
1,Disappointing,Where did the writer of 'Milk in my Coffee' go? The plot seems to be suited more to a short story. The Sexual Content was too much for my liking. Characters weren't well developed. Couldn't develop any empathy for any of the characters.
1,Very disappointed,"What kind of crap is this? Pure junk! I really want to like Eric Jerome Dickey's books, but no matter how I try, I just can't. This is the 4th book I've tried and it's so painful to read, so idiotic and ridiculous, I'm ticked off that I wasted my money. No more EJD for me!"
2,Missing Something....,"I was very disappointed with this book. The narrator was smart but yet so stupid. It was easy for him to see that Nicole had this love for Ayanna but he could not see that this was not a healthy relationship. Nicole needed counseling. She couldn't even accept the fact that she was gay. Everything the subject came up she blamed on Paris. And the scene with the mother... GIVE ME A BREAK and some reality. I didn't have a problem with the sex scene (I have seen and read worst), I did have a problem with the fact that Nicole had this power over two people and I can't see why. In my eyes, she was waek. She was so eager to explore this other side but she couldn't handle all that went with it.This book was poor and a waste of my time and money. I finished in a day and a half. I have to admit that I couldn't wait to get to the end. I hate to start a book and not finish it and I wanted to end this madness.Maybe in the next book, we will find the EJD that wrote ""Cheaters""."
4,more like 3.5,"this isn't my favorite book from Dickey. It's not that it is a bad read, I'm just not sure how realistic it is. I don't know any man who is just gonna accept that the woman he loves is in a twisted, very odd relationship with someone else. Neither lover, in my opinion, is going to be that patient while the person in the middle takes her sweet time to figure out what she wants.Having said that, this book is, once again, a pure display of Dickey's genius. It is an original look at the very typical love triangle. Dickey does an excellent job of showing both sides of the situation, as well as explaining why the chice is a difficult one on the part of the woman in the middle. I was pleased with the end, as I usually am with Dickey's books. But I was troubled by the circumstances that finally played into the middle woman's long term choice."
2,Not even close to his best,"Where do I start? A poor effort from Eric Jerome. It seems to be a rushed work drawing something from personal experience. His style thank God remains intact but this piece is far from his best. Lovers of milk in my coffee, Cheaters and Liars Game will be disappointed."
1,"""wasnt worth the $6.00 i spent on this book""","I thought the book started off too slow...the writing style was terrible...too many words or letters left off of sentences...too much guessing at what he was trying to say...one of the main charcaters didnt have a name!!! i thought nicole was being so selfish...the part when all three of them were together was the worst threesome i ever read about or seen in my life...this definetly was not one of his better readings...this book was for my book club and only i was able to remotely finish it just because, the other girls cant even get past page 3...i have read alot of books in my life and this one is at the top of the list as one of the worst..."
4,I couldn't not believe this woman.,I couldn't believe this woman. Talking about wanting your cake and ice cream too. WHOO!! I felt sorry for the brotha and then this crazy woman dogging him out. I swear. As you can tell I had strong feelings for these characters and you will too. Great BOOK!! This was a roller coaster ride and I felt the ups and downs. Definitely a keeper. Put this one on your bookshelf. That means BUY IT.
1,Disappointed.....,"So far I have loved all of EJD's novels. That's why I ran out and bought this one. I understand that this subject is a rather popular one to explore lately, but I have to admit, I really expected more from such a great author. Although I was disappointed with this novel, I look forward to reading his lateset novel Thieves Paradise."
3,Is this porn?,"I am a huge Dickey fan, and I love the sensuality he expresses in his writings, but I thought this one was over the top. I thought it focused so much on the sex that it didn't get enough into the plot. Of course, I couldn't put the book down, so maybe that tells more of the truth than I'm willing to admit, even to myself!"
4,Extremely DESCRIPTIVE!!,"I have had the opportunity to read all of Mr. Dickey's books and with all honesty I can say this book left me with my mouth open! I just didn't expect the subject matter to reach such heights. The book was just so extremely descriptive, almost too descriptive in some parts. I truly enjoyed the fact that there was a limited number of characters in this book as compared to some of his previous books. This book will certainly bring out the best discussions in book circles/clubs throughout. I can't wait to read other reviews!~"
3,"Interesting, Deep...","I have read ALL of EJD books, and enjoyed them all. I have rated all of his books between 4 to 5 stars, however, after reading this book, all I can say is hmmmmmmmm....."
3,EJD is still The Man...but I was a little dissapointed.,And it wasn't b/c of the storyline either. I hear a lot of people saying it was too shocking. I thought the actual storyline was great. I just didn't think he delivered it as hard as he did in his previous books. I don't know it was just something missing. But I will still buy anything that he puts down on paper!!!
2,Eric Jerome WHO?,"I guess I should wait until I'm FINISHED reading the book before reviewing it, but I just couldn't hold it in any longer. WHAT THE #$%! IS THIS? It's like i'm reading something with EJD's name on it, but written by someone else. The writing style was TOTALLY different from his previous works,and it didn't work for me OR HIM. I think the characters thus far (I'm 3/4 of the way through the book) are under-developed and shallow, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that they won't be developed any further in the last quarter of the book if they aren't by now. The story focuses so much on sex between the three that it takes away from whatever else was supposed to be there. And what's up with Nicole and her DENIAL? She keeps blaming the narrator for her current lifestyle - WEAK! This book is just not working for me, but I'm going to finish it because I bought it and i'm 3/4 of the way through it. EJD please go back to the way you were writing before."
4,Hot and Exciting,"I enjoyed reading Between Lovers. I just now started reading Eric Jerome Dickey's books and I can't stop. This was the first book I read. I enjoyed reading about the situation a lot of people may go through. I enjoyed it, but I wish Nicole would have chosen her 'other' lover instead of the one she ended up with at the end."
2,Not very believable.,"I found myself frustrated while reading this book. It took me a little longer than usual to finish this book because I got tired of it. I don't konw whether or not it is unrealistic, but I had a hard time believing the strong feeling held by the characters. Therefore I thought that the things that they put themselves through was ridiculous. I've liked all of the other EJD books except this one."
2,DONT WASTE TIME READING THIS BOOK,This book was horrible the plot is disgusting and weird and my sister and I both read this book and was very angry at the work from Mr. Dickey we expected more. At then at the end of the book if you don't stop in the middle cause it's so bad that you can't go on reading the book yyoure thinking i know i didn't just read this book for this to happen. I guess it just wasn't my type of a book.
4,The Next Chapter,"The book had an intriguing appeal to it, EJD made it seem as if he were the character himself, the nameless character writing was brilliant, fitted perfect for this type of novel. EJD knows how to keep his fans happy!!!J.R."
5,Incredibly taking!,"This was the first book I read by Eric Jerome Dickey, but it's now clear I am a fan! I've just finished reading his last novel, and it will definitely take some time before I completely recover... I just loved it (although I am a French white guy) and felt so close to the characters, so moved by the story. I even couldn't finish the last 40 pages, wondering how it would end, and hoping it would end the way I thought.... Great job, really. Sounds so real. I will definitely go get some more of Dickey's books tomorrow!!"
1,STRUCK OUT!!!,"I was very disappointed in this story. I found it ""far-fetched"" and ""vulgar"". Where was the ""ROMANCE""? Francis Ray and Rochelle Alers are more my style. If you're looking for romance stay away from this book."
1,Disappointed Loyal EJD Fan,"I've been keeping up with EJD books and Between Lovers is such a disappointment. Though I knew the subject matter, I expected EJD to be simply detailing an alternative lifestyle - since everyone has a place in society. Instead, the book is about a selfish woman out to fulfill her sexual wants (not needs). The sex is explicit, the characters are shallow, and story line typical when there's shallow characters. This story would have been more appropriate in a short anthology book - not big novel."
3,Just Okay,"I was so excited that EJD had a new book out. I have totally enjoyed his previous books. To keep it short, this was my least favorite of his books. The characters and the storyline were cool, it's just that I wasn't feeling the way he was wording things. I got kind of bored but I won't put EJD down, I'll be waiting for his next book."
2,Just Not The Same,"I must say I was greatly surprised by this book. I've read every one of Mr. Dickey's previous books and put my money in this one. I just didn't like it. As usual, his characters were deep and the dialogue on the money but I just couldn't root for anyone in this unholy triumvirate. I honestly feel that he wanted his public to explore a world not often ventured into but I felt that I could have done without going there. Nicole was selfish, our ""hero"" pathetic in some ways and the other woman(I forget her name) was just too difficult. Nice try Eric but no cigar this time"
2,Between Lovers,"I have read several of EJD's work and I have to say I was dissapointed with this book. The love triangle between the narrator, Nicole and Ayana was unrealistic.Nicole, an extremely selfish woman wants to have it all. She has no consideration of Ayana and the narrator. Ayana and the narrator are also weak characters, giving into so call Nicole's spell.Eventhough the book explored other themes(spiritual, mother-daughter relationships etc), it concentrated mostly on explicit sex (x-rated) scenes."
2,Ugh!,"I did not enjoy this book, it's bordering on soft porn. I am getting pretty tired of the same ole trite, bourgeouis (sp?) people who are so enlightened into jazz blah blah blah. And why is it that he takes these selfish characters that always end up not learning some type of lesson. They just kind of have some drama and then things fall into place. No challenge to their integrity or values. NO growth.And was it me or were the two pursurers bordering on obsessive about Nicole? Also, the character of Nicole wasn't developed past her sexual prowess for you to even understand what's so great about her that they were willing to compromise the way they did."
3,I commend you for accepting the challenge.,"You are an awesome writer, Eric, and I am your biggest fan.I found this particular book, like the rest, to be well-written. EJD has a talent for crafting words into artistic paintings. I admit, the subject matter was difficult for me to grasp, but in the end I appreciated it because of its authenticity. Somewhere, this is someone's story, and I think that you did an excellent job in sharing another couple's agony.This stuff happens everyday, and EJD is to be commended for accepting the challenge of writing about it. I know he has been criticized highly for it.I am a real fan EJD. I support it all."
4,Hot Like Fire,This book is off the chain. I loved the way Mr. Dickey kept the narrator annonymous. It was different and gave the book a mysterious appeal. Mr. Dickey does a great job with imagery and keeping the story at a steady pace. I hope Mr. Dickey gives us more explosive erotica in the future. Two thumbs up on this attempt!
4,LOVED IT,"In EJD""S newest novel Between Lover's we meet the narrator, (who remains nameless)his former lover Nicole, and her new lover Ayanna. The story takes place in Oakland, CA and opens with Nicole setting out to get her former lover (no name) up to Oakland from his home in Los Angeles. After being left at the altar by Nicole, you would think he would have learned his lesson. Oh no.....he goes to see her and eventually meets her new lover Ayanna.Nicole is the type of person who is very selfish, self centered and just has to have her cake and eat it too. Once no name and Ayanna meet.....it is on. They both want Nicole and of course Nicole cannot or will not make a decision on who she wants. EJD has written a story that is on a different level than any of his previous works....amazing. You will love to hate Nicole, Ayanna and no name. This is a great story and I highly recommend it. Continued success and blessings to EJD."
2,what the???!!!,"what's really going on? this was just plain pornography. i was very disappointed with this latest installment from the author. i guess ""liar's game"" was just a hint of the impending downward slope. i hope the next book is more like ""milk in my coffee"" instead of ""debbie does dallas""."
5,Renewed Faith in EJD,"Although ""Liar's Game"" disappointed me, I was willing to give the writer another chance to impress me with ""Between Lovers."" I was mentally stimulated by the synopsis of the story and once I began reading, I could not put it down until I finished the book 9 hours later .This book illustrates EJD's versatility. In this book, he ventures deeply into Erotica, which proved to be mentally and physically stimulating.The dialogue was witty and funny.Thank you EJD for renewing my faith in your work [post-Liar's Game]. This book was EXCELLENT!"
1,"VERY, VERY DISSAPOINTED","I was originally told by one of my reading partners that it was best to borrow the book instead of buying it, but I did not believe her until I purchased it for myself.By the 5th page, I had to close the book and take a good look at Mr. Dickey's picture on the back. I was so dissapointed to a point where I stated wondering if this is the same person who wrote ""Cheaters, Liars Game ect..)The book did not doing anythig for me or my friends who read it. Being a dedicated fan who have read all of Mr. Dickey's previous books, I sincerely hope this style of writing is not something permanent in terms of his fiction skills.D. Ownster"
3,another good read,"this is a good book about morals, values, self-respect and idenity confusion. a woman is so emotional, and mentally confused and stuck between her man and her woman. she really is having an idenity crisis. at one point she makes you mad, then you find yourself feeling sympathetic towards her. she has a good, open heart but doesn't know how to follow it. i wish it would've ended differently but it was still a good read."
2,What's Up With This!,"I love Eric's writing, but this was not his best work. The writing was like putting something together fast, without a mode. The narrator was a whimp and out of character for a real man. A real man will not share his woman with another woman. With all the mess going on, who loves anyone more than life itself. You know what's going on and having a relationship without protection, be for real. Eric show me the old Eric, and he is an excellent writer."
4,Good Anyway!,"Ejd this book brought on great frustration or let's say the narrator. He loved her greatly or did he? Maybe he was like Ayanna infatuated with her. Well Nicole wasn't all that and never will be. To me she was very selfish, she made her decision and she should have lived with it. Does this really happen with guys? Women will move mountains I guess some men will too Huh. Well again I feel the book came through just as your others have. Your sense of humor is great! I was also impressed with your dad, I like his strength. Keep me reading!"
3,LOVIN' E J D,....I PERSONALLY LOVE ALL YOUR BOOKS. THOUGH THIS WAS NOT YOUR BEST IT WAS A GREAT BOOK. THE THING I LIKE ABOUT YOUR BOOKS IS THAT YOU'RE REAL. YOU DONT SUGAR COAT ANYTHING. SO WITH THIS BOOK I DIDNT TAKE IT AS A MAN AND TWO WOMAN. I RELATED IT TO MY LIFE. BECAUSE I KNOW THERE IS ALWAYS SOME UNSEEN LOVER IN MY MAN'S LIFE. SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY I LIKED THE BOOK. YOU JUST HAVE TO RELATE IT TO YOU AND YOUR LIFE. MOST PEOPLE CAN'T HANDLE SEENING THE OTHER ONE WHOS STEALING THEIR LOVED ONES AFFECTIONS....KEEP WRITING
3,The end is the best part,"I have voraciously read all of Mr. Dickey's work and was so eager to buy and read this one. I have to say that the majority of the book is a freak show!!! EJD was very descriptive about alternative lifestyles but I found the characters very disturbing. Nicole was a very selfish, self-centered person who could dish it out but not take it. I guess that you could say that Ayanna was a counter-balance for the unnamed main character, but I also found her to be very sinister and bitter. The main character was such a wimp throughout much of the book; I'm glad that he found his strength in the end. I wonder if this main character is somewhat autobiographical??"
2,Ugh!,"Two stars because I'm not here to hate the author but at least give him props for the effort.I realize this is fiction but its so unbelievable that it bored me. I skipped a few pages with the anticipation of a good ending. But give me a break. The protagonist was a selfish bitch and didn't deserve the back and forth love she received from her lesbian lover and her ex-fiance.The idea was interesting but the words just didn't move me. It was like the author just threw something together, after a while, just to get to a decent word count."
2,not your typical EJD book,"I usually love Eric Jerome Dickey's books, but I HATED this book. Nicole was portrayed as very selfish. I recommend any other EJD book but THIS one."
1,Disappointed Dickey Fan,I love all of Eric Jerome Dickey's books except for two. This book is one of the two. I did not like any of the characters and the book is sexually over the top.
3,Just o.k. - got better towards the end,"Well, I HATED this book at first, then it kind of grew on me. I mean, I just wanted the whole sex thing to happen and be done with it. It seemed to drag on and on and on. This book was definitely not one of his best."
1,Sooooooo Disappointed!,"I have read all of Eric Jerome Dickey's books and a couple of them, I have re-read twice. So when I saw that he had a new novel out, I rushed to get it. To say I am disappointed would be an understatement. This book is horrible! I can understand the message he might be trying to convey, however, the language and descriptions are too graphic and unnecessary. This novel reads like one of those trashy novels that I would never bend the cover on, and I wish that I had not paid full price for a hardcover edition of this book."
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"I did not enjoy this book at all, I am a faithful reader of Eric Jerome Dickey books and this book did not seem to captivate me at all. Yes the love scenes was very descriptive but thats all. Their was nothing wonderful about the character Nicole that made these people fall head over heels had nothing special about her. The characters seemed under developed, nothing stood out about them. Ususally when I read a book it takes no more than 3 days tops, but this book seemed to drag for a long period of time.It did not draw me in. There was a few and I mean very few interesting scenes but overall I found it as a huge dissapointment."
2,Disappointed,"I am a huge EJD fan and have read all of his books. However, I must say that I was a little disappointed. The story seemed silly to me and just an opportunity to write about/explore ""3-way"" encounters. I did not grow to care for any of these characters and found them to be somewhat unrealistic. I look forward to EJD's next masterpiece. This one was not it"
5,PAAROT HEAD MUST HAVE,I usally don't write reviews but i am making an exception. If you are a parrot head or wondering what one is. this book is a must have. It is well written and the information is great. Alll around fun book. And if you ever went to a concert watch out you might be in the book:-)
2,One of least useful Kennedy's books,"I am fan of previous 2 Kennedy's books, NO BS Business success and NO BS Sales success.This book is disappointment for me. You will find some copy and paste quotes for his previous books and his bonus chapters are noting but waste of paper, and shameless promotion of his ""inner circle members"" who claim to be experts in mostly real estate. I have to say that if you follow them and get sucked into their ""seminars"", ""principles"" and ""techniques"" you will have empty wallets and nobody but them will get richer.In this entire book there are just a few things that are worth anything and any smart entrepreneur already knows them. Get real Kennedy, we are not idiots. You want to sell books and use them as your self promotion tolls. Good for you, but offer us something more useful in your ""books"" than this BS.This is my last Kennedy's ""book"". If you want to ready good stuff from this author read ""NO BS Business success"" and ""NO BS Sales success"". They are way better."
2,Only Got Through a Few Chapters,"This is exactly the style book I was looking for he... the author states from the start that the book isn't about the ""trendY"" sales techniques but those that actually WORK. The real world examples, however are what prevented me from getting more than 1/3 into the book. While having real world examples of the lessons are obviously beneficial for the reader, they are so frequent, and so frequently based around the author's own successes, that it takes away from the lessons themselves and the book ends up being a big pat on the back for the author instead of a helpful guide for the reader. It comes off narcissistic and a ""look how much I am paid for how little work and how much expertise I have"" kind of thing.... which quickly became very irritating to me. Josiane Chriqui Feigon's ""Smart Selling on the Phone and Online"" was like a breath of fresh air after this... I doubt I will finish reading this one, however...."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I FEEL REALLY RIPPED OF. I BOUGHT ALL THE BOOKS BECAUSE OF THEIR TITLE. BUT REALLY DISAPPOINTED. ... NOTHING NEW THAT A NORMAL PERSON WOULDNT KNOW...Please do NOT waste your money/Time with this book. Its boring and just like many authors he is trying to make money and nothing new in it(Real Shame). I Bought this book because the original book ""How to make millions with your ideas"" was extremely exciting and great. But then the author has simply used the fame of that book to sell his other books. I bought all the rest and they are all boring and I had to stop in the middle. Conclusion: He uses great tittles but the context is extremely boring and unoriginal and you will stop reading"
2,its slightly below average,"most of the book is just an advertisement for other products, although there are a few pieces of good advice in it."
2,boring.,Most of the guys are either from other titles or didn'tShow the goods at all. The camera work was dreadful almost as if the girl/guy behind the lens didnt want to get close to some guys.
1,Disappointed!,"I am very disappointed in MILKY WAY & MARS BARS: ASTRONOMY FOR KIDS! I am keeping the book because the glossary is useful, but the quality and format of the book is not appealing or effective in teaching children about astronomy. I was intrigued by the clever title of the book, but disapointed with its contents."
5,natural storyteller,"this story within a story, to me, is the highlight of the world according to garp. the plot is funny and beautiful and sad and humbles me as a writer. this story holds its own outside of the context of the novel, however i recommend it be read in the book for full effect."
4,Vintage performances,Late analog recordings ARE supposed to be rich and warm! This is an excellent example!
1,WOuld Love to Purchase,I would love to review and possible purchase this CD. The artists featured on this CD are world reknown. Please let me know how to purchase this CD to add to my vocal classical music collection
5,Excellent Belt,"I purchased this belt to wear for work. But I also ending up using it for casual wear as well. It's sturdy, well made and seems to be quality leather. I'm very happy I bought the Lee belt as I found it to be excellent compared to some others I looked at."
1,Not Lee brand,"Ordered this. Received and product has no ""Lee"" lable on it anywhere. Plus the quality does not seem so good compared to the online picture showing here. I was going to give this as gift. But I can't because the product is a ""no brand"" belt."
1,Baggy,"Bad fit for an ordinary guy. I can't imagine who they design such shirts for!I had luck with one of their Traveler shirts - it is really nice, so I attempted to get me another, twice.No more!"
1,The worst phone i've ever had,"And trust me, i've had some bad phones. The sounds quality is horrible. It sounds like the person you are talking to is in a tin can about 5000miles away. The answering machine has even worse quality. I have 15 messages and I have no idea who they are from. Save yourself the trouble, never buy this phone."
3,Worked well at first,"This switch was so much cheaper and more attractive than the other models that I decided to try it. It works flawlessly for the laptop, but it keeps dropping the video signal for the home computer.It could be Vista, or the fact that we're running two monitors on the home computer, but either way it keeps resetting the nvidia control panel to defaults that don't work. The mouse and keyboard controls work but the video signal quit switching.Also the USB ports don't recognize some items (specifically the webcam)."
5,Good USB and PS2 KSU,This is one of the few KSU boxes I've tried that handles USB and PS2 connections to the computers. I also have a powered wireless connection on the mouse - and everything worked the first time without any glitches.
4,"Extract from &#65533;Books on Bosnia&#65533;, London 1999","An important documentary source-book, with full transcripts of the 1993 hearings which led to the International Court making a provisional court order demanding that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia `take all measures... to prevent commission of the crime of genocide' by forces it supported in Bosnia. Also containing important evidence of the negotiations over the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which would have divided Bosnia into three quasi-states"
1,It is not worth spending your moms money,"I was disgusted! How can bands like this get signed? Noise! Noise! Noise! that's all i can say about this disturbing band. Now, if you will excuse me, i have to listen to the best band out there(Strongarm)"
4,"David P. Graziano, Claverack NY",This is a decent product for the price (under $10). The playback quality is good and it also allows you to retrieve your messages via remote access. One minor inconvenience is the fact that the flashing message LED is difficult to read in bright light. Overall I would recommend this product for your land line telephone.
4,found one that works,"sadly, the days of digital answering machines are coming to a close.but i'm still living in the past. i'd have a rotary phone if i could.i tried an at&t; model, a radio shack model... both didn't work AT ALL.total crap.so i didn't have high hopes for this cute green one.but lo and behold, it actually works.sound quality, not great, but it actually records messages and my outgoing message is understandable.hope it keeps working.but, i have a feeling it's the luck of the draw. all these low-end electronics are build so poorly that you might get one that works and you might not. keep trying. it only took me 3 tries."
4,Dang Kip! This is fun,We play this all the time. It is great for kids and adults. Some of the animal choices are so funny and unique. It is so fun to see the different creations people come up. We have even saved a bunch and put them in scrapbooks
5,Dirk Powell Lays It Down,"In this second part of his cajun accordion instruction series Dirk Powell continues to clearly demonstrate techniques to help you learn to play the cajun style. He uses the philosophy of teaching you to ""fish"" by showing critical parts of the cajun accordion idiom to help you learn to play tunes, rather than just playing a bunch of tunes for you to learn. Mr Powell also shares his insight of what's hip and what's not cool to do within the cajun genre, giving us a rare insider's view."
4,Pretty Good Deal,"I'm not particularly fond of this label, but the collection of ads (120 of them) is nice and the price is right.Pros: The majority of ads are above-average video quality. Nice assortment. Many celebrity ads show long-forgotten (and astonishingly YOUNG) faces.Cons: Watermarks everywhere on the corners of the screen. Annoying and large celebrity names in the bottom left corners of all ads...take too long to fade out. Distracting and intentional, so that others don't dupe them, I suppose. UPDATE: The buyer above is correct: this DVD does not play properly and does indeed flip you back to the main menu. You can still view all the ads, but it does require frustrating jumping back and forth to view them. Very botched.Bottom line: recommended."
2,Avoid Passport Video!,"This WOULD have been good, had it not been for the big watermark at the top of the screen that stays there on every frame!! I'll never buy another disc from Passport again, in fact I should send this back to them.If that wasn't enough, they screwed up the programming on this disc too- several times it goes back to the main menu then you have to search back to where you were, and selecting individual commercials from the menu sometimes brings you to the wrong part! Several things are misspelled too. Go with the Madacy Classic Commercials DVD instead; even though the quality of that one isn't great, at least there's no added on-screen junk and it actually plays all the way through!"
1,I call them bugs!!,"It's bad enough that you have to see watermarked 'BUGS' at the lower right portion of network and cable television shows, but I refuse to have to stare at them on a DVD. This otherwise acceptable DVD is marred by a bug at the top right corner of the screen, reminding you of what you're watching. To a video purist like myself, I can't stop staring at it. ""Something Weird Video"" has this same habit of putting these bugs on their DVDs. Needless to say, I never buy Something Weird Videos as a result (in fact, I returned the first one I bought after seeing it). People buy DVDs to get pristeen copies of whatever they want, and putting a bug on the screen just shows the disregard Passport video has for their customers. I'm going to try and dump this on Ebay."
2,"Talented, but . . .","Undoubtedly a talented player, but Correa shows questionable taste on several volumes of this ""Cuerdas, Amor, y Guitarra"" series. Strong melodies abound, but there is little improvisation, no surprises, and nothing to perk up the ears of a discriminating listener. Conservative music for folks with an eye and an ear in the past. It would be interesting to hear Correa play something more challenging and more original."
4,"Great Metronome, But Needs a Volume Control","This metronome is a great product but needs a volume control. The knocks and chimes keep perfect time, but are at full volume. There is no way to reduce the volume in situations that require it. If not for the lack of this feature I'd give it a 5."
5,Solid sturdy metronome,"If you are looking for an easy to use metronome with a nice wood block sound, this is it. This metronome is extremely loud which I love because you can actually hear it over your instrument which helps you keep on beat. If you're a piano player, brass, or violin player for example, you need a loud metronome so it's sound doesn't get lost in all the forte. It has an easy to use dial to pick your temp and a wonderful clicking sound with blinking lights as well. Love it!"
4,Good overall.,Needs a volume control ~ unbelievably loud can be heard throughout the house. Otherwise seems to be a good product.
3,Too loud,This Matrix metronome was my daughter's piano teacher's choice for a metronome. It has really helped my six year-old keep the beat during piano practice. It's easy to use. She can set it up by herself. The only problem is that it's too loud and we can't adjust the volume. It really doesn't need to be that loud and I wish there was a volume control.
1,Be careful that this is the movie that you want.,"If you are looking for the erotic movie ""House of Love"" this is not it!!! This is some pg-13 movie about an orphanage, and emotionally disturbed kids."
3,I'm On Fire,"I'm On Fire was all I knew of Chelsea. Great song, one of my favorite punk tunes, but the record is dated. There are a couple of gems, and I'm sure in 81 it was a good effort.still is."
1,Way out of date,"May have been slightly, very slightly, useful in the 1980's but not now. Written about a limited demographic -- Silver Spring, Maryland -- and not worth wasting your time over."
1,Trite,Nothing anyone with common sense couldn't figure out for himself. Don't waste your money. I knew the author and could fill a book myself with stories of his unprofessionalism. I suspect the good review was by a relative. There are much better books than this one.
1,Too bay my intuition didn't tell me to pass on this one!,"I was not pleased with this book becuase I did not find it practical for my daily life. To me, there were too many intangibles and indefinable ""beautiful nothings"" being bantered about for me to get a real grasp on the subject matter."
1,I will never read another one like it,"Ok I bought this book thinking I was going to be able to grow into a better person or be able to make good decisions on my own with out the agnoying of worrying. I was clearly mistaken when I read the review for this book. The review made this book out to be something I clearly do not think it is. In the true fashion of this book, take a deep breath and don't even think about buying it. You can learn to relax all on your own you do not need someone to tell you her personal experencies with it so be wise and do not purchase this book!"
2,disappointing,"I expected more from this accomplished author. There are a lot of books about intuition out there yet, but my own intuition hasn't been much help in finding a satisfactory one. This book asks some important questions, such as how can you distinguish your intuitive voice from other inner voices (i.e. how do you know when to believe your hunches and when to regard them with skepticism), but I don't think she goes far enough in answering them. The book is only about 25,000 words, which is about one-third of a book by most publishing standards, and reads as if it was written in a week. Also, there is a tendency in new-age self-help books to write for an audience of would-be entrepreneurs or creative artists, which is of little usefulness to many potential readers, who might be able to use their intuition to deal with truly difficult situations (""you should see a therapist"" is her advice to those with problems...). Maybe worth borrowing, but I wouldn't buy it."
5,The Golden Vortex,"Great book that I would highly recommend to anyone that is interested in vortexes, vortex energy, portals, time travel, and the Bermuda Traingle. Easy to read and very informative. We met Nick last year at the Montana Vortex and he definately knows his stuff and will keep you informed as well as entertained.The Golden Vortex"
4,Great debut!,"Sal Paradise's debut album is an inspired collection of driving progressive rock ""Celestial Railway"" and folk-laden ballads ""John Grady"". Especially of interest for fans of Joe Christmas and Luxury."
3,Power-Pop Nugget,"I was attracted to this CD by one tune heard on XM. Overall, the entire record matches the unthusiasm of what it attempts. Great melodies and hooks abound. If you're a fan of this type of retro-pop, then The Red Button is for you. My only problem is that some tunes become laborious and obvious. In the 60's, this may have been a better EP. However, this is the 21st century and I'll take what I can get from this genre. for my money, The Spongetones did it better. If you seek something more powerful and everlasting, check out either of the 2 Jellyfish CD's."
5,Red Button Rocks!,"Truly great albums don't spring up overnight, so to say The Red Button's album is refreshing is an understatement. I find it usually takes about 4 tracks into a record to know if it just 'clicks,' and once you get to 'She's Going Down' you'll reach that conclusion.The 60s niche is more than easily filled here with tracks like ""Gonna Make You Mine"" and ""Free"" sounding like something you'd find on The Beatles' classic records. Cozy and clever lyrics mixed with relatable and memory inducing themes, The Red Button reminds you what its like to throw in a CD that makes you forget about the worries of the world and enjoy it.Each track strengthens one another to form a comfortable, crisp and endlessly satisfying album on the whole. Perhaps the greatest achievement made by the artists here is creating tracks that you can leave on repeat, hear over and over, and appreciate each and every time."
4,Pop from another time and welcome in this one,"The Red Button is fun. A duo who have decided to revisit the past with some wonderful pop, influenced by bands like The Beatles, The Rascals and even Elvis Costello. (Check out ""Hope's Up"" and see if you don't hear some early period Costello) Listen to the melodies and the harmonies, this band would have been huge in the 60's. The question is, do they have a place in the 21st century? I sure hope so. This is a delight, and while it occasionally drifts towards the ethereal, the solidly constructed tunes pull the song back to earth. It's short, sweet and while it could use a bit more lyrical depth to be truly great; it should be a welcome addition to the collection of anyone who loves well-crafted pop"
1,Better of going to this site: http://www.usholidaysonline.com,"http://www.usholidaysonline.com is/will be more up to date than this book, this site will tell you what is the exact date of the holiday according to the day of the week so we can plan our vacations properly.Thanks, but ill pass on this book."
3,Poorly packaged,"For such an expensive item, Anime Works has certainly spared every expense. for your $59.95 list price, you get 8 discs stacked on a single spindle so the discs are pre-scratched for you when you open the case. Packaging is skimpy and cheap looking."

2,not satisfied,there was to much talking not enough music. the picture was very grainy and audio was not very clear would not suggest
3,Good music,"I love the Chieftains, but I thought it was just a concert. This DVD was more like a documentary interlaced with songs."
5,an extraordinary book for all ages,This book is both a lyrical and visual treasure. I bought this as a Christmas present for a niece and couldn't part with it! I even bought a copy just so I could mat and frame some of the incredibly magical pictures. This is my favorite children's book`of all time.
5,A Magical Book....,"Child of Faerie, Child of Earth is not to be confused with 'New Age' anything. It is a lovely story of a 'child of faerie,' a boy, and a 'child of earth,' a young girl. The story is magical as they discover each other's world and the differences between them. Then,they must make a difficult decision that affects their deep friendship. The illustrations are lovely, and add to the wonder of this story.I love this book! My granddaughter loves this book! Anyone who enjoys a good and gentle well-told story with beautiful illustrations will love this book!"
5,i loved it,"i really enjoyed this book. it was a magical tale of discovery that i share with the young chilren in my life, as well as the older ones. this book is appropraite for all ages and should be shared with all looking for a magical tale."
5,Beautiful,This book has a very sweet and beautiful story written in poem style. It also has beautiful art within each page that helps to make the story seem to come to life. My daughter loves this book! A very good short story to read just before bed time.
3,Certificate Holder,This certificate holder are advertised as having an 80lbs cotton cover but they don't feel like it. They are not too bad though and did the job.
4,callaghan's bride,haven't read yet but I'm sure I will enjoy it. I enjoy Diane Palmer books. Easy to down load and received quickly.
2,Vastly Over-rated....,"I don't think I'll ever read this book again bcs. this book wasn't developed well at all emotionally & since the history of this book's hero(like having had a mother who had 5 sons even though she hated being a mother! I mean, even in those older days, there was a very simple method of known birth control -- using a vinegar-soaked sponge!) & a few other details in this book(like a giant snake that kept escaping his cage) didn't sound realistic to me at all...."
4,This is vintage Diana Palmer,"Cag is a hard working, sightly older rancher. Tess is young, shy, inexperienced and poor. After her father's death, six months ago, with no place to go, she remained on Cag's ranch (one of five which he runs with his brothers)as a housekeeper. The younger brothers all like her, except Cag who never fails to complain about her work. But could he ever let her go ?This is vintage Diana Palmer. We had more or less the same story line in Champagne Girl, Snow Kisses, Rage of Passion and September Morning.I liked those books so I wasn't disappointed with this version."
4,"Big Tool, Small Package","This tool has came in handy several times. I bought it becuase I wanted something that isn't bulky. This tool is exactly that, very small. It's a simple and straight foward tool that comes in handy."
3,Only one flaw...,I like this tool and everything works great except the bottle opener. The problem is when your opening a bottle the blade is exposed. You can cut yourself if your not careful
3,"Slightly dangerous, difficult to use","I find this tool very difficult to open. I suspect many people would find it impossible to open. The knife is very sharp and it seems quite possible that you might cut yourself as you struggle to open. When closed and hanging on your keychain it is longer than your keys and the point is very pointed. I can easily image an auto accident where all two inches of tool ends up buried in your thigh. I tried it for a few weeks and found it too obtrusive particularly when sitting with it in your pocket. For a less obtrusive tool I settled on the True Utility TU47 keytool. Also I might recommend the Swiss Army Cadet knife, at one ounce a little heavy for the keychain but very nice in the pocket with a sturdy build and has most popular implements."
5,Excellent KeyChain,The Utili-Key has to be one of the most convenient multi-tools out there. It's the size of a large car key. The blade is sharp and stays that way very well.
1,"OK, Until it falls off...about two weeks","I own this product and hate it. It was fine for about two weeks, then it loosened up to the point it was always falling off my key ring. It is now somewhere in a drawer and I don't miss it at all!"
2,"Small, well-made but bad design","This multi-tool has a couple of flaws that leaves it on my desk instead of on my key chain. One must open the blade to use any of the tools, which also releases it from the key chain. I would much prefer that it stay on my key chain. Also, to pull the blade open, one's fingers have to get right next to the sharp blade. The risk of cutting oneself is probably very low, but it doesn't feel right. Bad feng shui or something."
3,BS,This item along with other items on Amazon are under the search made in America or made in USA. It is howerever MADE in CHINA.
1,Broke after 1.5 months,"I purchased this item a little over a month ago and liked it for the most part. I liked having an accesible knife on my key ring. The bottle opener doesn't work well--slips easily which is scary with an open blade on the other end. Regardless, it broke--the metal actually snapped right behind the screwdriver where the bottle opener is. I think this was due to the stress of opening bottles although it was in my pocket when it actually broke. I was very lucky I didn't cut myself when I reached for my keys because the knife was exposed as a result of it breaking. Also, I never used this product in any particularly stressful way--just opening boxes and bottles. I could never recomend this product as a result."
3,Good little multi tool - bad for pockets,"I used to carry this tool with me every day on my key chain. I used the knife, screwdrivers and bottle openers the most... with almost no incident. But my pockets took a beating. The end of the philips screw driver is pretty sharp/pointy and put many holes in my pockets. To counter it i just used a pen cap over the end. It works but defeats the purpose and doesn't look as tidy (ie:cool)."
3,Useful but pokey and broke.,"I found the knife very useful, but it was also pokey in the pocket. Then it broke. I had it for about 2 weeks. If I buy another one it will be more substantial."
3,"Handy and Convenient Tool - Not Bad, Not Great","The ""Swiss Tech Utili-Key 6-in-1 Tool"" attaches easily to your key ring and is completely unobtrusive, being the same shape and size of a normal key. The multi-tool can be a little hard to open at first, but becomes easier with usage.While it says 6-in-1 (Flat Screwdriver, Micro Eyeglass Screwdriver, Bottle Opener, Phillips Screwdriver, and Knife), I find that the Phillips Screwdriver and Knife are the most practical and get the most use.The tool is reasonably well made and sturdy, but should not be used as a pry bar or other high stress uses.A handy and convenient tool, recommended if you like having basic tools with you at all times."
1,it's waiting to cut you,"I've had 3 Swiss Tech products in the past, and found them greatly useful. The design of this one, unfortunately, requires that you grasp on to the sharp end of the knife in order to open it. Really not safe, really not what you want."
1,"Useful, but left wanting...and hold on to your keys.","There are six tools on this key. 3 are useful. Philips screwdriver...useful, Sawtooth blade...useful, straight blade...useful.The flat head and eyeglass flathead are in places that have no reach, and the eyeglass flathead seems to be machined to thick for eyeglass screws. The flat head would have been better positioned at the end of the straight blade. The bottle opener is in such a place, that if your hand slips, you could possibly slice yourself on the blade that you use as a fulcrum when opening the bottle.There is also no place to thread a key ring, which means when you use two hands to release this tool from your keys, your keys fall to the ground.One more thing about the key novelty of this item- don't forget to remove the tool from your keys before you waltz through airport security. If you can't bring nail clippers, I'm pretty sure this will be a red flag."
4,Neat gadget!,I found you cheaper than the stores in the mall by about 40%! What a neat gadget for my husband who carries them around. This you can put on your key chain and not be too bulky in your pocket. Thanks Amazon!
3,Product descriptions should be revised when the product is revised.,"I bought this thing about a month ago, primarily because I wanted a bottle opener for my keychain and this looked like a unique product. However, when it arrived, the product did not match the description or the pictures here on Amazon. The one I received has no bottle opener. Instead, they put a nail file on the back of the knife part so they could still call it a ""6-in-1"" multitool. I just wish I'd known this before purchasing.My guess is that they revised the product to not include the bottle opener since many people are saying that it is dangerous to operate.With that said, it is still a decent tool without the bottle opener, and I still get some use from the knife and screwdriver. It just doesn't make much sense to continue advertising the tool with a feature that it does not include."
1,Too fragile,"It is very inexpensive, however it lasted only 1 month before the small piece that closed over the key ring broke off. I do not recomend this product."
3,"Has a few functions, but not amazing.","While this tool seems to built with six functions in mind, it is hard to practically use each utility. The bottle opener is hard to use, as it's a bit thin. The ""flat-head"" is little more than a small piece of flat metal. It is not easily usable as well. The blade is the true winner in this multi-tool. It is both the handiest and most called for in my life. Best for opening small packages, cutting zip-ties, etc.If you want a small lightweight inconspicuous blade on your key chain, this could be your boy. If you want a serious multi-tool though, better stick with a Leatherman."
3,Nice little item.,"This isnt some super great multi tool, but its a nice on hand item. It goes great with my keys and I always seem to need a screw driver and this works much better then the tip of my knife in a pinch. Oh and its got other functions too! I put up pictures to show what words cant."
1,Good idea poor quality,Mine broke within 2 weeks of having on my keychain. The metal loop that attaches to the keychain broke clean off. Look for a better quality tool elsewhere.
1,Junk!,"I bought the Swiss-Tech Utili-Key 6-in-1 keyring tool at Wal-mart. I dropped it once, and it broke in half!I don't mean it broke at the pivot point, but the metal itself broke! The model number of it is UKCSB-2. It mayhave been made as lower quality for Wal-mart, because I notice that a similar product sold at Amazon is model UKCSB-1.The price wasn't much different than the similar product at Fred Meyer, though.I will avoid all Swiss-Tech products in the future."
4,Fiancé loved it!,Got this as a stocking stuffer for my fiancé. He thought it was a really awesome gift when he got it and spent awhile playing around with it. He says everything works really well on it except the bottle opener is a little hard to use.
4,Everyone should have one,"Pros:Great tool. Helpful everyday and easy to carry. The phillips head is tricky to use as the blade may cut you if you aren't careful but I've never cut myself. I lost my 1st one which I had for years. The flat head screw driver has no reach but still comes in handy. The best part is that it is camoflaged as a key on the key chain so you can bring it anywhere. I really like it.Cons:I would have given it 5 stars if the end of the blade was a flat head screw driver instead of the short ""nubby"" one on the key head side. If you get it, it will be used all the time."
1,USELESS,"This tool, while well constructed, is impossible to open without using a knife to pry it apart...and if I have a knife to open it, why the hell do I need this tool??? Maybe it will loosen up with use but then you'll have to worry about it inadvertently opening up and falling off your keychain. I'll stick with the Gerber mini pry bar thing I bought here."
2,Novelty Item Only,"I bought this item because I liked that not only was it the bottle opener I was looking for, but it would blend into my keychain while simultaneously being a knife and several screwdrivers. More bang for my buck, if you will.Unfortunately the bottle opener is placed in a really strange place which makes it hard to use, the knife is only really good for opening envelopes (I tried to use it to cut the tape off of a package I got in the mail and had a surprisingly rough time...something tells me a regular key would have worked better.) Also, although I have not used them yet, two of the three screwdrivers are placed in such a way that makes me quite sure that they will be just as hard to use as the bottle opener.I wish I'd gotten the one I looked at initially (Church Key Bottle Opener), but I really can't justify buying two keychains in a month. Because they are keychains.Would not buy again."
4,Great EDC stealthy mini tool.,"When it comes to being prepared having the right items can be a life saver. This light weight, sturdy key chain item actually blends in well with your own set of keys and is a welcome addition to my EDC (Every Day Carry) items. I've carried mine for a year and love it. In short there are a lot of Pros to this multi-tool that make it desirable.The Cons include: A difficult to re-sharpen blade (I save my blade for emergency use). It's slightly tricky to pull open as you have to pull on the blade itself (and there isn't a lot seperating the edge from your fingers), and although it 'clicks' into place- it doesn't lock open so you need to be especially careful manipulating it, i.e. you may not want to open beers with it after you have had a couple.TSA friendly? No.American Made? No.Still: A great buy."
4,Pretty Neat.,"Its a pretty cool thing which attaches to your keys easily. I really like this because it is almost exactly the same size as a key when it is closed. Doesn't make my key chain massive like other multi-tools I have had previously (Got annoyed carrying a smallish swiss army knife on my key chain). The tools seem to work pretty well and the metal doesn't feel cheap. However, be careful when using the screwdriver or the bottle opener. The blade is pretty sharp so you can cut yourself trying to open a beer (Especially when you are drunk).Will definitely keep this on my key chain as it has proved useful at on many occasions."
3,"works ok, just don't put it in your pocket","Blade is not that great, screwdriver is very small, and if you put it in your pocket, expect to be hurting! Its good for stabbing yourself in the groin."
5,Great Tool,"A bit stiff at first, but after using it a few times it feels just right and has never fallen off my key chain. I would rather it be tighter than looser for sure. My girlfriend and I both have one and use it all the time. Anybody ever ask for a knife or screwdriver? Well you always have one on you now. Most tools are just too bulky to carry. This one is on your keys, which you have all the time. Best tool you'll ever use because you will always have it. I have had mine about 3 or 4 years, left it outside a few days in the rain, and just wiped it down and it's still shining. It's made with really good material, blade is still sharp after using it for years. I should buy a few more just in case they stop making these."
3,Swiss minimalist army knife,"I paid $8 for this to fill up a Free Shipping order. I wish I picked something else. Six tools in one? More like 2.5...PRO: I keep it on my keychain all the time. It's nice having the blade(s) handy to open shipping boxes or FedEx envelopes. The small size rarely causes a problem in my front pants pocket.CON: Opening the device (to release it from my keychain) takes VERY small fingers/fork/knife blade/etc because it is so small. And when it's open, the three? screwdriver tips are too small to use on average size screws. (if I'm unscrewing micro-sized screws on a laptop or eyeglasses, I'd rather use the specific screwdriver designed for those delicate products)BOTTOM LINE: If you see one for $5 or less, grab it. Otherwise save the money for a real Swiss Army knife/SOG tool/Leatherman tool."
2,Convenient but cheap,"I loved this when I first got it, but after about 5 months of only occasional light use, the Philips head tip broke right off. I was tightening down a screw on a Wilkie talkie (small screw into a plastic clip) and the head of the screwdriver stripped right off. This is an inexpensive pocket tool, and I would like to think I got my monies worth out of it, but there are so many other pocket tools out there of better quality that this one is not a must have. If you like it, buy it, but just be aware of its limitations. Very nice ""design"" though."
4,Great Tool To Keep on Keyring,"I love this little tool. It easily fits on a keyring, and you won't really notice it. It is slightly longer than most keys, but it doesn't cause a problem. It can be a little difficult to open (you really have to get your fingernails in and pry it open), but it's very handy. Of course the knife blade isn't very sharp, but it's sharp enough to open boxes, trim a string off you clothes, or other little tasks. And the screw drivers are handy too. Overall, a great little item and great quality."
2,"Great, but easily lost","I just lost my third one of these. I am not sure what is going on, but they seem to just fall off. I have a few other Swisstech keychain tools that have been with me for years. Seems this one comes loose in a few months at most. Otherwise it is a great tool."
2,Cool in concept,"The phillips is too small for most tasks, and mine broke after about a month. Better off with a small weatherman tool."
2,Poor design,"Ive had this product for 6 months and the only thing impressing me is the fact that it's still on my key chain. It has a nice compact size, but that is the only thing nice I have to say about the design. Any time you need to use one of the tools you have to completely remove it from your key chain which increases the odds of it getting lost. I thought the bottle opener would be the tool that would get the most use, but as you can see from the picture that requires you holding onto the serrated blade to get leverage. This can't be the best key chain tool for the price. After saying all of this I'm sure I will get stranded in the wilderness and this thing may save my life. If that happens I will amend my review."
4,looks good but is cheap inside,"the product looks good and the swivel works as well. but underneath the finish is some very cheap and brittle metal. after a few months on my key chain, I used the Phillips screwdriver to remove a small screw from my laptop and it broke the head of the screwdriver. The other tools on the product haven't broken yet so its still on my key chain until it does."
5,Love!,I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! It can be used on almost anythingAnd I am thinking of getting them for men in my family and friends.
1,too sharp,"The very sharp Phillips screw driver protrudes. It stuck me in the leg and would have made holes in my pants pocket. The tool was retired on the first day, before I had a chance to use any of its functions."
2,Inovative but not very useful,"Like other Swiss+Tech tools I have purchased, this is a good idea executed rather poorly. Like the concept but in real life have never used the tool"
1,not great,"I feel this item is not great. it is a pain to open (prying both sides with fingernails of each hand), the bottle openner is bad because you end up having to use the leverage of your fingers against the flippn blade to use it and the curve is too tight (i have to almost parallel the tool with the neck to hook the lid). its not really a worry but its the principal, the blade against finger that is. also i wish that i could open it and still leave it on my keys but you cant at all. whenever i need it to open a beer i have to pry with fingernails from either hand, catch my keys with my palms, use it without cutting myself, and spend 5 seconds putting it back on my keys where i want it to be. basically i bought it to open beers and cut things and it doesnt open beers well. the cutting side is great but what tool doesnt come with a sharp blade."
2,"Dangerous, with little functionality","This lightweight multi-tool seems great until you try to use it. You have to handle it as you would a cobra to make sure you don't get cut. It's difficult to grip and control because it's so thin. Even opening it is a hazard. If you have it on your keychain just so you always have *something* with you in pinch, fine. But carry something different if you expect to use your multi-tool with any regularity."
2,useless,Don't bother with this one. You have to open the key to use any of the functions. The bottle opener is worthless and the knife can easily cut when you open the key. Look elsewhere.
4,Swiss Tech UKCSB Ulti Key 6 in 1 Keyring Tool,"Works well, I mainly got it to have a pocket wire-stripper. Since this is my main use for it I would have loved if the serrations were cut into the tool at different depths to handle different gage wires a little better."
4,Very good for what it is,"No it is not a leatherman. It's a small knife and screwdriver - which is very useful for everyday situations.While traveling, I need something lightweight that I can carry with me and use. I use to carry a small swiss army pen knife, but kept losing it in airport security.The only way they could improve it is to somehow make it include scissors."
2,"A good idea, but not quite right.","I bought one of these at Staples, thinking it would eliminate the need for any kind of utility knife. The biggest problem is that because of it's small size and thinness, it is harder to grip and use comfortably. The knife is sharp thanks to the serrated edge, but you'll have to figure out how to hold tool without cutting yourself in the process. The other tools work fairly decent, but nothing to write home about. Overall, this feels like a novelty rather than anything necessary. Though the stainless steel seems strong, with effort you probably could snap the two pieces apart. For what this costs, save your money and get a real utility knife."
4,Good Product very handy,This is a good product and comes in handy when you are looking for a tool. It is has good design and is worth the price.
1,do NOT use the bottle opener function,"do not try to open a bottle with this. The blade is very sharp, and you will cut yourself trying. For the same price, get the Gerber 22-41770 Artifact Pocket Keychain Tool"
3,good to have but hard to use,"I've had this attached to my key ring for a number of years. I don't need it often but when I have it's been useful as long as I am very careful while handling it. The knife is extremely sharp and because the key is pretty thin it can rotate easily in your fingers. It's not incredibly easy to close around a key ring with one hand, and does with a bit of a snap, so you need to make sure your fingers are well out of the way when you do. The Phillips screwdriver on the end of one of the tines is helpful for things like tightening eyeglasses, but it is slightly offset from the opposing blade and I've nicked or jabbed myself with it more than once while it's in my pocket. You're supposed to lock it at either 90 or 180 degrees when using it, but when you close it from 90 the keyring end easily grabs at your fingers. This isn't a product for kids, and only should be used with extreme care."
4,Great Item,"Really good for travel. It goes through security with no problem and allows you to take a very minimally usable knife on the road. Believe it or not, in our current hyper security conscious state this is huge.If you travel get one."
5,Can't go wrong for $8,"I just got one of these about a week ago, and I'm really happy with it.People have expressed concerns that they might accidentally cut themselves on this, but I don't think it's a real issue. The key opens up 180 degrees, and locks at BOTH 90 and 180 degrees. So, if you want to use it as a saw/pocket knife, it will lock out straight. It you want to use the screwdriver, it will lock at 90 degrees so you'll have a sturdy handle. This locking feature also means that it is easy to close the key without cutting yourself.The tool feels very sturdy. It's apparent that a lot of thoughtful design was put into this product. Highly recommended."
1,Eh,This key falls off your keychain easily when trying to use it and I cut myself a few times before chucking it in the trash.
3,Nice,"The bottom opener works, takes some getting used to. Otherwise the blade is not to sharp, which is not that bad because it is on your key chain. Overall most of the options work."
2,Butter Face of a Tool,"I would love to say this is the most useful little tool. It does look the part, great profile on the keychain and despite what others have experienced, it is actually less pointy than some of my actual keys - so no holes in my pockets, but...This is REALLY HARD to use. I need a tool to open this tool. You open by prying the blade and screwdriver apart with your fingers which wouldn't be a problem if the hinge weren't so hard and also if there were some way to grasp the blade safely.That's right, the intended way to open this is to grasp the blade (HUH???) and pull apart - good luck with that.Or better yet - do not buy."
4,key tech,exactly as i expected it to be. used as a gift and it was liked by the men i bought it for.
4,Fine Product,"Literally the only thing I dislike about this utility key is the fact that it's so difficult to open all of the way and then close back again. On the other hand, this is better than it being too easy to open and having it stab your leg every time you put it in your pocket. Other than that, it works exactly like you would expect and the knife blade holds an edge well. Even if you don't want one for yourself it would make a nice present for a relative, husband, etc."
2,Ehhh...,It's helpful but not too easy to open (at least for me). I'm always afraid I am going to hurt myself trying to use it!
3,"Light-weight, useful-ish, but needs a re-design","The form factor is on the money. At 0.5 oz. this actually light enough to be unnoticed on my key-chain. The locking device is clever, simple, and the just the right strength. Clever in that it holds the 'blades' closed and attached to the key-chain, and locks the knife from going backward when bearing down. Finally the Phillips screw driver is actually useful, so I like Swiss+Tech Utili-Key.But don't expect too much. As several reviewers point out, the 'knife' is poorly placed and could cut you when using the Phillips head. The knife itself is of questionable value and I'm not sure I want to sharpen it considering the previous point. Also there are some posts that the 'knife' was confiscated at the airport. Personally I think Swiss+Tech should drop the 'knife' in favor of a reasonable flat screw driver, but this is just me wishing."
3,Buyer beware,"The item I received is NOT the one in the picture. Mine has a nail file where the bottle opener is. I opened it without reading the packaging first, so that's my fault, but shipping to return it would cost 75% of what I paid for it (FREE Super Saver Shipping first time around). So, I guess I'll just live with my mistake. We'll see how long it lasts. I'll update this review about the actual funtionality of the item later. Maybe I'll forget it's on my keychain and TSA will take it."
4,Very Useful!,"This is a great multi tool you can take everywhere with you. Has been very useful. And is made from high quality material, will last for a while!"
1,SWISS+TECH UKCSB-1,I HATE THIS THING AND IT CAN CUT YOU WHEN TRYING TO USE IT. I HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT.
2,More of a gimmick than a real tool...,"Yes this will work in dire situations, but you're better off buying something more stable because this item makes a great gift, but a dinky tool.the blade is literally 2-inches long. half serrated and half straight. For example its not very good at cutting zip ties, i did cut my finger trying to cut a zip tie. This will definitely let you cut soft plastic packaging.Another annoying part is opening the keychain. unless your thumb and finger nails are rock solid, you'll have a heck of a time opening this knife to use it. When you do open it, the screwdriver becomes the only substantial handle for using the knife.lastly i wanted to point out that it doesn't work like scissors. My friend thought it worked as scissors, i had already opened it a few times so i KNEW it wasn't like scissors, but to someone reading this that has never used it before, just be aware of that."
5,Outstanding,The Utili-Key is awesome. Slightly longer than an average house key but same thickness. Packed with great tools and a great addition to my key ring. Highly recommended and is a great huge idea.
2,ok i guess,The multi tool is ok for people who dont need a multitool. The knife doesnt cut anything and the rest of the tools you use a knife as a handle. I feel this is a design flaw to say the very least. Not a waste of money but it didnt really make me want to recomend this to anyone.
3,it works just ok,"It is a nice piece to look at, and to carry as a key chain. It does not work very well as a tool."
3,"Easy to carry, not very functional","6-in-1 is a generous description. The knife with plain and serrated blades is handy, unless you already carry a knife. The Phillips screwdriver is small, but functional. The bottle opener is small and inaccessible, therefore worthless. The pliers only real purpose is to secure it to your keyring. The flat screwdriver is also tough to access. All round this is a poor choice, however it is easy to carry and inconspicuous. The best tools in the world are worthless unless you have them available. This is a good gift for those who do not have/want a comprehensive EDC (my wife) or on the spare keyring at home."
5,comes in handy more often thank you'd think,i've had this for over a year & gave em out as x-mas presents. extremely handy tool. blade is EXTREMELY sharp- even the jaggies of the saw are sharp. i mean be really careful when you close it. it's well built & doesn't feel flimsy- even when tightening screws- i never feel the tool bend. it opens/closes easily but snaps into place so it's never accidentally opened on its own to fall off the keychain.best part is the knife/saw is sharp enough to cut those annoying plastic packages like butter. really convenient to pick-up the mail on the way to the front door & pop out the knife to open mail or slit the tape from courier boxes (& to slash & hack away at your name/address label) before you even get in the house.oddly enough airport security always misses it.
3,Terrible Packaging,Pretty disappointed that the packaging was just paper and didn't match the nice steel tin that is is showed in some of the images uploaded by other customers. This was supposed to be a gift but now it looks cheap so I don't know what I'll do with it.
2,"A delicate little thing, eh?","Impossible to open this with one hand. It would be a very helpful tool if one-handed operation was designed into it.Then the upper part of this (fairly new, hardly ever used cuz it's so hard to open) key -- the semi-circular part that hooks onto a key ring/keychain, broke -- so I can no longer hang it on my key-ring. Now it rattles around in my pocket with my spare change."
1,Surprise! No bottle opener... Nail file instead.,I ordered this key chain because of the bottle opener. But the item I received had no bottle opener. Instead of bottle opener there was small nail file on the back of the knife. I really don't like the nail file. What kind of man carrys nail file on his key chain. This product did not match with the description and the pictures here. The product has been changed but they did not change the product description and the pictures for some reason.
1,dangerous and useless,"I like the idea of always having a little tool with me. I often need a knife to open a package. I like to have a little Phillips or screw driver to fix glasses or make quick repairs on a computer. I'm a sucker for multifunction tools! They aren't usually as good as the real thing but are much better than empty hands!The Swiss Tech 6-1 Util-Key was a disappointment! I opened it, looked it over carefully, and then promptly threw it away. It's hard to open without another tool such as pliers. Once open, it's hard to imagine using the tools without endangering yourself. It's cheap enough that I didn't bother returning it. However, it's in the trash 15 minutes after I opened it! There are many better alternatives! A Swiss army knife (for example) is bigger but infinitely safer and more useful."
2,bottle opener?,"Anybody figure out how to use the bottle opener? I got this tool to take a bulkier bottle opener off my keyring, and add the other useful features. Maybe I'm missing something, but the phillips screwdriver doesn't make much of a lever."
1,Exceptionally Flawed Design,"1. Should be a way to permanently attach to your keychain. Instead, when you open it, it separates itself from said keychain.2. when using the bottle opener, one must grip the knife and saw blade. Safe.The design of this is so poorly thought out. Terrible."
2,It's not the original...,"I bought this utili-key to replace the one I had owned for about 4 years. I bought my original one from ThinkGeek.com, but purchased my replacement from here because it was cheaper. Little did I know...This utili-key is a rip-off. I have the original to compare it to. Refer to the item photo. That is NOT what it says on the one I received. Mine says: Swiss + Tech Utili-Xey. (I'm pretty sure that X and K are not the same letter.)The other bummer is that it sticks and is very difficult to open. I have bent and broken my nails trying to open it. Now that I know better, I have to find some sort of implement with which to pry it apart.Once I manage to open it, yes, it works and does what my old utili-key did, but even when opened it still requires a fair amount of force to open it to the desired angle.All-in-all, I am really bummed about my purchase. I do not recommend buying this product from here."
2,The size hampers the efficiency,"Bought this thinking that the ability to have it with me 24/7 would make sure I would actually use it.However after a few months I realized the following:Pros:Knife actually is fairly sharpCons:1.Make sure you don't cut yourself trying to open it (you need to grip it with your fingernails too)2.The edge is a pokey danger in your pocket3.The small flathead ""eyeglass"" screwdriver is too thick for my eyeglasses4.Good luck sawing anything. You have almost no surface area to grip, and risk stabbing or stabbing yourself too.In my opinion, you're better off doing the job right with a larger tool. At least then your hands won't be scrambling for purchase."
2,Awkward and Infuriating,"Okay, I am a reasonably intelligent person. I have three degrees. But I can NOT for the life of me get this thing to open. I've tried force. No good. I've tried tools to open the tool. Nada. I've tried throwing it across the room. Made me feel better. However, the thing will remain closed. Maybe I can use it as a weapon and poke someone in the eye. I give it two stars because it would be rather useful IF I COULD OPEN IT!!!"
2,Handy but not durable,"I thought this would be the ideal pocket tool. Unfortunately, my experience with the quality of the tool has not been great. I broke 2 of them in exactly the same way. The little arm that pivots to form the loop that keeps it on a keyring broke while in my pants pocket. I also had trouble opening the tool to use the knife and cut myself several times. Not serious, but annoying. I'm not typically a klutz, so I'm not taking the blame. It didn't work out for me, so I moved on to another pocket multi-tool. The small size of this tool is great and it had exactly the features I wanted. I'm bummed that it didn't survive."
4,Moderately useful but not worth a lot,"I have kept one of these on my keyring for the past several years. The knife works well in a pinch and has kept it's edge. The bottle opener is awkward to use without cutting yourself and usually requires you to pry the top in two areas to remove. Both the phillips head and flat head (mini) screw driver ends were stripped and warped with the first use; the metal was too soft to keep it's shape. It has definitely been useful because I would not have been able to cut, open bottles, remove screws, etc in the particular situations where I've needed it. But think twice before you spend a lot on it and consider it an ""emergency"" tool that you won't use regularly."
4,Portable utility,"The Swiss Tech utilikey is really a useful tool if you don't want to carry a knife on your key ring. I like all of the useful little functions of the utilikey, especially the serrated knife blade. The only reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is really difficult to open without long fingernails and most of the time I need to use my teeth to get it open. Besides that, it is a pretty handy tool that I take with me everywhere."
4,Well built but somewhat inconvenient,"This product is well built and durable, however it must be removed from the key ring to be utilized. This makes it somewhat inconvenient, although taking it off is as easy as opening it up. Overall a good product."
2,Worst Bottle Opener Ever,"In theory, this is a great little tool. I like how they tried to fit multiple useful functions into one compact item (though I only count 3 or 4, not the advertised 6).In practice, this thing is awful. The main problem is that the bottle-opener functionality is backwards and misshapen. Because it's backwards, you don't get any leverage when you're trying to open a bottle and the point of the knife end can dig into your hand. And because it's misshaped, it pokes a hole in the cap before opening it and generally takes 3 different angles to actually get the cap off.I can't comment on the other functions, because I threw this junk away after it made me spill Coke all over."
2,Need a Crowbar to open it,"It's a great concept, and I can't say much for it's functions but the bottle opener is good I used it and it worked well. However one major flaw is, it's WW3 just to open the darn thing! I feel I need a pair of pliers just to get the darn things open, and if you dont have nails like me you are in some serious trouble. Like I said great concept, and looks great but as for useability I feel it is almost useless for the difficulty to open it."
5,Great product,This is a great quality tool for your keychain. Don't even know it is there until I need to use it.
3,Useful But.....,Useful But You have to take it off of the key chain to use it. It comes in handy cause it is always with you.
3,"Inconsistent workmanship, but good gift",I received a gift last year at it was great. I bought 12 this year for gifts and they were difficult to open the tool to use. I do not believe they were tested. Will I buy again? Not on line or via Internet.This product is a great gift if it works.
1,...blood on the keyboard,"Hard to open, hard to work. Great idea in theory. Needs some design work. I can't recommend it until then."
2,Didn't knock me outa my socks,"This is a handy tool if you can't our are uncomfortable having a knife or multi tool. However this is not the item you want to rely on to get you through a tough spot. More of a hey i don't have to look for this other tool. I don't expect it will last more than a few uses, and would not purchase it again."
2,Swiss Tech -- not so much...,"The Swiss Tech Utili-key 6-in-1 was a promising little tool, offering a sleek design with high utility-- until you actually try to use it. I was displeased with the need to pry it open with my fingernails & felt a lot of apprehension each time I did so, wondering when my thumb might slip on the straight edge. It opens up 180 degrees, locking but only jusst: apply too much pressure & it will fold up, making useless the leverage its length is supposed to provide. Popping a bottle cap off is a bit of a chore because it's so thin, even after trying it out on several bottles of, er, cream soda. The straight and serrated blades are sharp, and cut great, but the handling is so awkward as to make them more dangerous than useful. Finally, I find it inconvenient that my keys have to dangle while i pry the tool open, which means I'll be picking them up off the ground every time i want to use this tool.It was a cute idea, but cute won't cut it..."
4,"erudite, but could occasionally be a little more practical","The blurbs for this book states that the author is ""superbly knowledgeable"" and that the book is ""complete and very detailed."" And correctly so- for each of a dozen or so human relations issues, Feldman discusses a wide variety of rabbinic texts, addressing both areas of consensus and areas where leading commentators disagree.Having said that, Feldman occasionally misses issues that would be of most interest to a nonscholarly reader- I'm not sure whether by choice or by oversight. In particular, Feldman begins by discussing Jewish law prohibiting embarrassing others, as well as related principles. But how do you vigorously disagree with someone without violating these principles? I wish Feldman had addressed such borderline issues in more detail."
1,Four Billion Bucks 3D-not,"It seemed like a cult film. The 3D effect did not work. I have a 3D TV and one that is not and could not watch it with either TV, let alone with or without glasses. Total waste of money."
3,Steeler Flag,Nice flag but a little too small. I expected it to be larger. Nice detail for my front yard. good quality material and withstands the rain here in Florida.
1,Very disappointing,"Zyflamend Liquid - Promotes A Healthy Inflammation Response, 2 oz., (New Chapter)This was the nastiest (sorry, but it fits) tasting liquid I have ever tasted. There was no way I could use the product enough to determine if it was effective for me."
1,I cannot recommend this book.,This book was very disappointing. All characters were wishy-washy and uninteresting. This story could have been told in a novel half the size. It was drawn out with meaningless dialogue. I've never seen a hero and heroine with less chemistry than the two in this book.What exactly was the point of the heroine having sex with a man who contributed nothing to the story line? He and his son came in and out of the story without a purpose. If there was a purpose then Ms. Taylor Quinn failed to deliver it.Ms. Taylor Quinn should stick to writing for Harlequin Superromance. This book was truly her worst work.
4,Cute and practical.,"Pros: I bought these for my little sister's 2007 Camry and she loves them. Having rubber car mats is great for rainy days, accidental spills, coming home from dirty places like a dog park and just about everything else. They really help to keep a car clean and the floors in good shape.Cons: The picture of the dog is a little greyer than the picture. Also, be careful, because the air filled bags they pack into the box transfer ink to the mats if the mat is slightly wet and it doesn't come out. The mats are also not as thick as I expected (but I am also comparing them to very high end ones I have in my car)."
4,Pretty good even at a concert,I bought this camera specifically to sneak into the Duran Duran concert and have some pretty amazing shots and VIDEO. It was definitely worth the expense and it has many functions. You just have to take the time to learn the lighting and other options.
5,Library quality books,"These are beautiful books and will add grace and beauty to any library. They are easy to read and informative about the ancient civilizations of the Egyptian, Babylonian, Hittite, Assyrian, and Persian Empires. The books are well written and researched. They are meant to provide a more general background of the different civilizations with some in depth review of scholastic research on each empire. Each book has a different author and some authors treat the materal more generally than others. They are definately worth getting to read or just to have in your library to look at."
5,Empires of the Ancient Near East,"A wonderful set of volumes covering Babylonia, Egypt, the Hittite and the Persian kingdoms. Written by different scholars it is simply a wonderful read. This is another group of books put out by the Folio Society. Should be required reading for anyone interested in the subject."
3,ok,Doesn't mix as well as other brands...doesn't really taste like cookies n cream.1 scoop only mixes with about 4-5 oz. of water/milkFast shipping.
2,Very light load capacity,Don't use with anything over 200 watt start-up load. This thing will burn up with anything more. That means start-up load. I don't know about run-load: mine burned up with a 600 watt start-up load.
2,Cruxshadows Saves It,"I bought this CD while lurking around the ""Goth"" section of a local music store. I must say, the theme seemed interesting enough, so I thought I'd give it a try. I wish I could say some great things about it, but I'd be lying. The only good cut on the entire CD is ""Deception"" by the Cruxshadows, which mixes lovely Goth/synth beats with the beautiful music of the band's equally beautiful violinist. Other bands featured are Beborn Beton, Wench, Bella Morte, and Neuroactive, though this matters little as their songs aren't worth listening to. ""Prey"" by Seraphim Shock is decent enough, but the band is really no more creative than any of the other talentless artists they share CD space with."
4,Almost as promised.,"Disc was listed ""like new"" condition but had some discoloration/heat damage on information side upon arrival. It is conceivable that this could have resulted from improper handling by the shipping company due to the package not being labeled fragile (i.e. - left in a hot truck while on delivery rounds or something). Bottom line is the individual I ordered from was prompt in getting the product out and the disc plays, thankfully, without problems. I would try this merchant again, should the need arise, due to mitigating circumstance(s)."
2,Ok background music,"This was an okay mix of various genres of music, but I get the impression that the assignment of X band to X vampire clan was purely arbitrary. The lyrical quotes attributed to various clans sometimes made little, if any, sense. Some matched better than others, but this album would have served the White Wolf bunch better if they'd had more bands/songs to choose from. Seems like White Wolf is in bed with some obscure bands & trying to cross-promote. Which is fine, but a little limiting on the musical choices."
3,Good background music for some situations but not all.,"I bought another CD of vampire music that is very useful as background and mood aid in the on-going Vampire game I run. I thought this would be great because it is based on the game. It is good, it is very much as advertized -- the sounds of a nightclub. However, the lyrics can be very distracting to the storyteller and the players so I decided not to use in in our game unless we go to some type of Vampire club."
1,A Waste,This book seems to be based on hearsay.there is also a lot of technical mistakes.The story of the Namibian president being kidnapped wasthough out bysomeone that smoked something funny.I have stayed in that country my whole life and anybody that knows the country will know that the chances of that staying a secret is nil.A total waste of money.
2,Got me wondering,"As a former member of the French Foreign Legion I happen to know Cuxon and he never was, as the author states, a member of CRAPs. I have to wonder therefore how much of the rest of the book was incorrect. Now it is possible that Cuxon was interviewed and lied but it's up to any responsible author to verify his information."
1,Very disappointing.,It may take a great deal of skill to do what this author has done. He's taken an exciting and dynamic topic and produced a book which I read and regretted buying.
1,"A work of fiction better titled ""special farces""!",The author erroneously tries to pass off his somewhat limited special forces knowledge with too much text. Hardly worth use as toilet paper!
1,This is some of the most racist comments I have seen.,".This is some of the most racist comments I have seen. Having known Col. Beckwith, and been a member of USA Special Forces I don't believe the so-called author interviewed him, or most of the others he claims to have interviewed.I only rated it as a 1 (worst) because I was unable to write in a minus number! If I was in favor of book burning I would nominate this book for the pile.Walt Shumate, as usual, said it much better than I can.Bob Jac"
1,Could have been better.,I'm afraid I have to agree with the readers who found this book less than they had hoped for. I really couldn't get into the book. There are some flashes of quality writing interspersed inside extremely long narratives that often had me nodding off. The author really needs to work on building her characters and limiting her subplots. I see some talent here. She just needs to work a little harder.
1,Generic sounding American musicians,"I am not trying to be mean, but there is just something very homogenized sounding about this CD: yes, it has lively rhythms, but every song sounds the same, it lacks, to me, what jazz musicians call ""swing.""honestly, it sounds a bit like when conservatory trained classical musicians dabble in ethnic music, its got a kind of corny quality to it.it just feels rather soulless to me.and again, i know this is rather harsh, but its just my opinion.and to be clear, this is a recording made in the usa, i think north carolina. as i recall i dont believe any of the musicians are turkish, not that they neccesarily have to be, but...."
5,Fantastic,"This album is amazing. So very, very danceable. Lots of classic songs I know, plus some surprises. Wonderful arrangements. Love it."
5,"Easy transaction, works great","Ordered this from Amazon right when I ran out of ink. This was my first new cartridge for this printer, and it was easy to install and works great. The item was as expected and shipped quickly."
1,Defective when received!!!,I recieved the toner in new unopened condition on time. I needed a spare since my original was showing low. I installed the new toner about a week after I received it. It started printing with 2 wide dark lines on the documents within 2 pages of printing. I tried about 10 pages and reinstalled the old toner cartridge. It worked fine but still showed low toner. I do not have any way to get the toner I purchased warrantied. Is there a way??? If I can get a resonable resolution I will change my feedback.
1,Caveat emptor! 1 Cartridge/month,"Buyer beware! The print life of the cartridge is unacceptable. I've been running through 1 cartridge/month in my small business office! In 3 months, the price on the ink will have passed the price of the printer."
2,Lifespan way too short,"I don't know who in the real world averages 5% coverage, which is Canon's spec for getting 2000 prints out of this unit. So you can't believe you'll get anywhere near 2000 prints. I've been averaging about 600. I love my MF4270 printer and get great quality prints, but the toner life is completely unacceptable."
2,Canon 104,"The cartridge life is pathetic and a rip off, sorry to say. It doesn't bode well for the company in terms of ethical advertising. i feel like i am replacing one each month with about 500 pages -- very limited use. In a short period of time, i have paid more for the cartridges than i did the darn printer. I am averaging $800 per year for cartridges.You have got to be kidding.The printer itself is ok so far, however.I would suggest if there are ""compatible"" cartridges at significantly less price, they may be worth trying, especially if they advertising the same specs. does anyone have any experience with similar products?Thank you."
5,Good Enough,"Good solution for this equipment.The better is that you have all in one unit, do not need to buy anything else. Great Idea by Canon.And the better is that still you can reffill it and it works ok."
5,No Complaints,"The product seems to be working fine with absolutely no quality issues. Not sure yet if the lifespan will be equal to the manufacturers replacement product, but so far I have no complaints and the price was right."
3,"Only one that works, but oh, the price","This toner would get 5 stars for quality - that's why I'm back to buying the name brand. But boy, it costs at least 6 times as much as the ""compatible.""The problem is that I never know when the ""compatible"" products will leave black on the edges, or shade the entire page grey, or miss ink in various parts of the page.I'm afraid it's worth it to pay the extra to know that it's going to work as soon as I put it in until it's out of toner."
5,High quality !!,Beats all compatible/cheaper alternatives. No extra lines or spots. Worth the extra money! Delivery was timely. Will buy more Canon brand when it runs out.
2,Agree with others about short print life,"I agree with everyone else who has put in a negative word about the lifespan of the Canon 104. I work in a fairly busy office and we just purchased a Canon laser all-in-one a month ago, and when we started noticing having to change the toner every week (!!!!!), I started keeping track of copy/print counts. Even at the lowest density settings, the most we've ever been able to get out of 1 cartridge was 1,300 prints -- a far cry from the advertised 2,000 prints. We are at the point that we will probably return the printer and go with something else. The only reason I gave it an extra star from rock-bottom is the ease of use (hey, if we have to change the cartridge weekly, might as well make it easy to do!)."
1,Little Value for your Money,"I purchased this product for my classroom use. This toner was intended for classroom emergencies in case my school is unable to complete my copies on time. With a deal like this, I thought I was getting value for my money. The two toners should have given 10,000 regular prints/copies. To my amazement, the first toner printed less than 700 student worksheets while the second toner printed just one packet of 8.5x11 (500 sheets). This was more than robbery and my money should have been returned. I would advise prospective buyers to beware of wolves in sheep's clothing. Cheap but no good"
1,HORRIBLE!,"It ended up damaging my printer! My humble request is to buy a toner directly from canon even if it costs a little more! At least, your printer will be saved."
3,"Good quality, poor quantity","Really good quality prints, but I need decent quantities too. After buying 10 new cartridges, I've decided to refill and re-use the empties before I buy more."
1,never got it,I ordered this 1 month ago and never got it but paid for it. What happened??????? Trina Please email me back and let me know how to get a refund
5,Canon 104 Black Toner,"I'm a big believer in genuine products, especially ink for my printers.I have plenty of stores that will refill my cartridges with their own ink, but I don't really save that much money (it actually costs more for the Canon cartridge) and the refills don't last as long.These genuine Canon cartridges are really long-lasting. I've used them for years and have 4 Canon multi-function printers to use them in. Even when the machine starts blinking that the cartridge is empty, just give it a shake and you'll get another 100 pages (or more) from it.I love my printers and these cartridges."
5,Canon Toner Cartridge imageclass MF4370dn,Great price. This is my second one in almost a year. We make quite a few copies here at home. I don't trust the Canon compatible cartridges.
5,Dell Black Toner,Black cartridge arrived timely and works just like an OEM cartridge. I will certainly order another black cartridge when the time comes. I may even order a color cartridge when the need arises.
1,NOT GENUINE,Be careful. You are not purchasing a genuine canon cartridge. They are falsely advertising this cartridge.
5,Very good,"It's my 2nd time to buy ""Canon 104 Black Toner Cartrige"" I am satisfied with the services Amazon provided and the quality of the goods."
2,Tough and Boring,"He's got a lot to say, but I didn't find it at all inspiring. I guess if I had a coach the helped me practice these principles it would work. But it's tough and boring to learn from a book."
2,New formula is not better than before.,"I've been using Ciment Anti-Usure for five or six years now. I have fine, thin hair and it was the perfect conditioner for me. It made my hair soft and manageable with no flyaway static problems, even in the dead of winter. I just started using my first bottle of the new formula about a month ago, and I am not a fan. My hair looks limp and greasy, yet I have so much static going on my bangs constantly stick to my face. My natural wave is hardly noticeable with the new formula."
5,kerastase results,"this product was mention to me by my hairdresser. its great for very damaged hair from too much processing, color, perms etc. would recommend to any one with very damaged hair, it really works !"
4,Very good,"It is kind of sticky and stringy, kind of close to the 'real thing.' if you are using this you would probably keep a towel or something nearby anyways for cleanliness, which might help when using this - it's easy to get it everywhere on accident, especially in the dark. Anyways, it works well and does feel natural, silky and soft inside. It is soothing and I am glad to say I bought a natural lubricant rather than something synthetic, basically. I think the ph balanced aspect sounds great, but is it best for the woman's side of things? Maybe you don't want something ph balanced being put all in there when your balance is usually slightly acidic to prevent bacterial overgrowth of any kind. I dunno. I'm sure most other lubricants aren't designed to be slightly acidic anyways. It's working for us so far and I am sure we are going to enjoy using this in the future. It is definitely thicker than some lubricants might be and that does work well for it."
3,Davis caught in one of his dullest periods,"Grmany wasn't good for Colin Davis. The years he spent in Munich and Dresden marked a decline into walk-through performances without life or sparkle. Maybe he thought he was fitting into some kind of grand tradition. These Mozaret performances could serve as evidence before the jury: they are slowish and slack, lacking any insight. Davis began as a Mozart specialist and gained his early reputation for some EMI recordings of the same symphonies that appear here. What a difference a few decades has made. I happen to like traditionalist Mozart, but not when it feels like sleepwalking."
5,Where have these been all my life?,"What an awesome idea. I have a home recording studio and my rack unit has about ten effects, recorders, etc in it, each one with a wall wart or 3 prong plug. Using these little guys, I was able to plug them ALL into one power strip. In the past, you could really only plug about four wall warts (AC Adapters) into one 6 plug power strip since they were so wide one unit would typically hide two plugs. Take that same power strip and add 6 Power Strip Liberator Pluses. Now you can attach 6 wall warts AND still use all 6 of the plugs in the strip. What an amazing idea, and why the heck didn't I think of it first? Don't buy the cheaper knock offs...these guys invented this so IMHO they deserve the cash. A great product, solid as a rock, and a Godsend to those of us with waaaaay too many power cables to deal with."
5,Very useful things to have around.,"These things are great to have around, as they free up space for giant adapter-type plugs, and give you an extra outlet to boot. Highly recommended for anyone drowning in cables. Construction seems very sturdy, and the wires are well insulated."
5,Good solid product,"Bought this 1 foot extension cord to add flexibility to my Kill-a-watt 4460 EZ meterP3 International P4460 Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor/. Nice compact and solid construction...works great and has a second socket on the back side of the plug, if you need to plug another item in."
5,"Nice helper, very pleased",I use it to obviously clear some clutter around the outlet without actually losing the outlet or having to use a larger powerstrip. Good product. It's not that long and it is very sturdy.
4,Power Strip Liberator Is Not A Toy!,"For some reason, the review process believed that the power strip liberator was a toy, and asked such things as 'how fun is this toy?'. Well, sadly, not very fun for a toy, but a perfectly good short extension cord. These are good quality power strip extenders, offering a a power outlet on a short cord, as well as one on the back side of the plug itself. It works well, and I recommend it for the purpose."
3,You can write on them,"I bought this product to put in a memo holder. I have to say that the sheets are paper, and that they're 4 inches by 6 inches. Also white. What aren't they? The thickness one would expect. Any thinner and you'd have onion skin. The full stack doesn't even fill up my memo holder. For the price I would expect 20lb copy paper instead of this cheap stuff."
2,Very few if any actual Cayce predictions,"This is an inspirational book a la Thurston. For me, the problem was that about 95% of the book is the author's words, with a very occasional quotation from Cayce. Also surprisingly, very little in the way of actual predictions for the 21st century. Not sure how the publisher arrived at the title for the book, perhaps to sell it?"
1,Extremely Bad - Don't Buy This Book!!!,"I saw this author interviewed in a documentary about Edgar Cayce and I was intrigued enough to buy the book they referenced. Boy was I disappointed. There are hardly any direct quotes from Cayce and Thurston's interpretations are really ridiculous. Did you know that Atlantis didn't exist in the past and Cayce was confusing the past and the future, so his memories of Atlantis are actually predictions of a future civilization? Ideas like this and the fact that the book is really about Thurston's own ideas and not really about Cayce at all made me really angry that I wasted money on this thing."
2,Disappointing Reading,"I purchased this book thinking I was going to learn about Mr. Cayce's predictions - instead I learned about someone else's ""interpretations"" of his predictions ... and mostly his views of humanity. Disappointing!"
2,edgar cayce s predictions for the 21st century,"The book is good if you want to learn a version of meditation. Many of the predictions in the book were wrong, the events came and went. I have actually lost interest in Casey's work because of this book. No wow factor. I'll take a look at another book sometime in the future to regain my interest in Edgar Casey. An easy prediction for this book, it will not be a best seller."
4,Very enlightening reading,"I found this book very interesting in its presentaition of a different possibility for our reality and our religion. I think it is a good read for anyone interested in the ""non-conventional"" wisdom about who we are, about Earth, and about our beliefs."
1,Don't waste your money,This telephone is worthless as a speaker phone. If you have any ambient noise on your end (for example a computer fan) you can barely hear the other side of the call while using the speakerphone. People on the other end of the call complain they can't hear me. The only way the caller on the other end is satisfied with the sound is if I pick up the entire speakerphone and bring it up to my mouth to talk!Save your money and the aggrivation of having to take this one back to the store you bought it at.
4,Did somebody say keep on rocking?,"Finally, somebody released this--thanks to Wounded Bird Records for finally getting this out of the vaults. I was not disappointed to hear this again, it being one of the better live records of 1977. I remember hearing about Derringer from friends of mine who saw them open for Led Zeppelin that summer. This record more or less confirmed what they were saying, which was: lots of fun, great band, good songs, killer guitar."
2,Hard Live,"This album was very hard rocking, no doubt about it but I wish it had contained more Derringer band material rather than old Rick tunes like Still Alive And Well and Teenage Love Affair.Also I never quite got the appeal of Beyond The Universe which always sounded like a hodge podge of noise.If you wanna hear how arena rock sounded in the 70's then this is a good place to start but otherwise not one of Rick's best efforts."
3,Making of 7th Guest was OK but not great,"the Making of was interesting, but not long enough - I would have liked to see more - but glad I got it"
2,Variable volume,"The music is good, but orchestra is predominantly featured. It is much louder than the guitar segments. Listening to this CD in the car was difficult since 'road noise' drowned out the guitar sound. If you want predominantly guitar, pick something else!"
2,poor quality,The music is great it's too bad the volume is almost non existent. You have to turn it up very loud to be able to hear it at all.
2,not what i expected,This CD for me was a waste of money. Its just not what i thought it would be. Others may enjoy it but for me..it wasnt what i was hoping to hear.
1,Automatically shuts off before I'm finished drying!,"This dryer has the irritating feature of automatically shutting off long before I'm finished using it; it can only then be turned back on a few minutes later. Perhaps it's an inherent safety feature to prevent it from overheating, but even if so shouldn't it be designed to not overheat until it goes well past normal usage?Don't waste your money."
5,Great buy,"Ordered this product over a year ago and it has been a lifesaver when traveling internationally. Very good hair dryer and switching between voltage settings is so easy. Manufacturer warns not to use the high setting when switched to 220volts, and believe me, you won't need it as the low setting at 220 volts functions as 'high'. VERY SMALL which is great for packing, but again, very good quality hairdryer despite its size (not your typical cheap travel dryer). When I purchased it, it was on sale, so my price was significantly lower than the current price. I would suggest shopping around to see if you can find it cheaper. Additionally, if shipping costs deter you, I have seen this same product at Linens N Things."
1,Was my favorite...until....it died. :(,"This was a great little dryer! I liked the size and the power. It literally dried my hair in like 10 minutes flat! Well, I noticed it started to get weak. I would switch it on to high and it would sometimes sound like it was low but then switch to high by itself (I know, weird). I didn't think anything of it. Well, today I was drying my hair and noticed the high level felt off. It wasn't as powerful as it normally is. I switched it to low to see the difference and it barely made a hum noise during that setting and hardly any air was blowing out of it. When I turned it back to high, it started smoking and smelled like fire. I immediately unplugged it. I am going to throw it away. I don't want to risk burning my house down or shocking myself. Don't waste your money, buy a different hair dryer."
3,Too big as a travel hairdryer,the only problem with this product is that it is advertised as a travel hairdryer when it is sized more like a regular at-home hairdryer. i'm still looking for a small travel sized hairdryer with the concentrator attachment.
1,Awful Dryer,"This is a very cheap, flimsy dryer. Don't waste your money, the thing will be non functional, or on it's last legs within a couple of months."
2,Shipping Stinks,"Shipping was crummy; I actually HATE those services that pick up the package and a few days later turn it over to the USPS for delivery... it's not faster, in fact, I think it's several days slower and you can't track the shipment. Actually you can track: it goes - package input to system, package picked up, package given to USPS for delivery - then all info goes dark for a few days. Sellers; put a stinkin' stamp on the box and ship it yourself, it will get there faster. This was a replacement and I noticed that even though the model number is the same they have downgraded the volume of air it puts out - not the seller's problem (but the shipping method is)."
2,it was not worth the money,"With all of that discount, I thought it would be a good deal; but the high shipping cost compensated for the seemingly low price!"
5,Scroll Design Paper,"I needed a special design paper for party invitations and was planning on making the design myself when I came across this special paper in your inventory. Great, perfect, and better than I would have put out !"
3,Cost Efficient But All 3 movies on 1 DVD on the same side of DVD...,I can understand compiling all 3 movies on 1 dvd to offer them at a low price but each film could at least have it's own disc.I understand these films have been issued on dvd before but the first time around it was done right.The bottom line:If you don't mind having all 3 films on 1 dvd on 1 side this is for you!
3,Did'nt seem realistic,"I did'nt think the killer would be so able to escape a police station, so easily. Why, did'nt they place angel in protective custody"
4,Very good book for applying self regulation in several areas of real life,"Self Regulation had been studied profoundly by educators, eventhoug the concept is useful in so many areas of human behavior. This is a good chance to know in general, all of it, in these areas.Nevertheless, if you are looking specifically for self regulation learning it won't be of very much help."
4,Pretty Decent Hair Gel....but,"I like this hari gel alot....it does keep my hair where I want it, but it leaves a trail evidencing that there is hair product in my hair(you know the hard, almost helmet-looking 'look'), so I think something that is a LITTLE better than this is Aquage Transforming Paste, albeit it DOES leave the same look that there is DEFINITELY hair product in my 'hair'(I want that natural look, no-gel-present look), but all in all this product is pretty decent...."
2,KMS HAIR MOLDING PASTE,This paste was kind of thick even though you rub it in your fingers to make it smooth before you put it in your hair. It pieces and separates your hair but only use a little bit.
1,It ain't what it used to be,I should have given more credence to the reviewer who commented that the formula for this product seems to have changed along with its name--now KMS California. My hair is fine and thin. The old formula was great. The new stuff is sticky and heavy. I am very disappointed.
5,"Simple, and simply the best!","Being a perpetually depressed person and serial negative thinker, I've read them all. The best up til now being ""The Power of Now"", and that is a great book!! This book is kind of like ""TPoN for the complete idiot"". It makes being happy as simple as realizing that your thoughts are just thoughts and not reality. Pay no attention to your thoughts. When you find yourself feeling bad you can instantly realize it's because of these thoughts and shoosh them away. It's that easy. For me at least. The author even goes out of his way to tell you that positive thinking is way too hard and takes up space that could be used for creative thought. Brilliant!! It's NOT THINKING at all that is the key; kicking your negative thoughts away like the hero in a karate movie. It doesn't matter how many bad guys there are if you are the master. Mastering this defense is as easy as pie. I've never been happier."
5,Exceptionally helpful for most life situations,"Carlson's book is a simple read with some profound insights. While it might not apply to extreme situations, (for example, the European Jews stuck in the Holocaust) and it may not be the sole answer for biologically-based clinical depression, it's likely to be quite helpful for the overwhelming majority of people. A few of the reviews have suggested that Carlson urges readers to replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. That's not accurate (and rarely works, anyway). His method of working with thought patterns is more natural and practical--almost a Zen of common sense. The book occasionally does feel a little unrealistic (e.g. the section on the friend who dies on the way to Carlson's wedding), but if you can get past those few passages, there are some truly valuable methods and insights that you can put into immediate practice. I found the book genuinely helpful and rather unique in the self-help genre. I'd recommend it to anyone."
5,Excellent Insight,"Richard Carlson's You Can Be Happy... provides an excellent ""inside look"" into the power of our thoughts.One of Carlson's major points is that our thoughts directly produce our feelings. Carlson points out that we often resist realizing this, and insist that it's ""reality"" or ""the facts"" that cause us to be upset. Carlson points out that there is always another, peace-producing way to perceive these same ""facts.""Another excellent insight from the book: the way to alleviate stress in our lives is to lower (not raise) our tolerance to it. ""Our level of internal stress wlil always be exactly equal to our current tolerance,"" Carlson writes. ""That is why people who can handle lots of stress always seem to do just that.""In sum, and excellent, practical, and down-to-earth (if challenging) book. Highly recommended."
2,Not worth reading the whole thing.,"After about 30 pages I caught on to the fact that there's no need to actually read this book; you can just flip through and read the section headlines. You get the same effect. The info in the book is all well and good, but seriously how many times can you say the same thing in one paragraph? I guess it's supposed to really drive the ideas home, but... just make it a pamphlet already. It's not a book."
4,Excellent primer for understanding how beliefs control us.,"I agree with the criticisms made by the reader from Chicago, IL , October 13, 1998. Taking those points into account however the book is an excellent starting point for beginning to understand how our beliefs and thought systems often control us - mentally, emotionally and physically.What a shame there isn't a book that takes it to the end point as simply and clearly - although Non Violent Communication is also a wonderfully helpful book."
3,"Excellant information, Dry presentation",I must admit the information in this program is exceptional. It brings to light common mistakes we all make in recognizing the differance between what is real and what is thought. Sadly the down side of this program is that the delivery of the information is dry and boring. Its actually hard to listen to more than one or two chapters at a time. I think you would be better served if you got the paperback book or if you really want to study this line of thinking on CD. try the CD's from Dr. Wayne Dyer. He keeps you up and motivated with a very well done presentation.
5,Great advice!,"There are no ""buts"" about this book...it can help just about anyone. I've passed on copies to friends over the years and they've all gotten something positive from it. There are great points inside and if you follow them you can make yourself feel better and really enjoy life to it's fullest. I recommend rereading it every year as a refresher. Today I heard that Richard Carlson just died of a heart attack at 45. Luckily we have this and many other fine books to remember him by."
5,"Simple, yet insightful","I bought this book having just finished the wonderful ""Manifest Your Destiny..."" by Wayne Dyer, thinking Wayne was one of the authors of this book and hence trusting it would be worthwhile reading. I ended up being surprised twice: (i) Wayne Dyer is not a co-author, but simply a reviewer; (ii) (the best surprise) Richard Carlson has done a great job explaining simple and down-to-earth situations in life that cause problems in the lives and relationships of so many of us, yet these are all problems that can be easily avoided by just keeping one's flow of thoughts in check. I will resist the temptation to give you concrete examples - the book has many of them. Go for it and take your time reading!"
4,Good Stuff,"The book is very good at bringing up points that most of us already know but we don't use wisely. I think it is a good refresher course on ""life"". Great book, I definitely recommend it."
4,Finally A Self Help Book That Is Not Boring!,"A very good read. Direct and to the point. It explains very simply that we are all ""only one thought away from happiness""."
3,Good for school paper,"I found this book to be incredibly boring, but it was very useful in creating my paper for school."
2,unsticker book,I was very disappointed in this item. They stickers did not stay in the book. they would fall off or only part of them would stick . would never buy again. it would have been great if they did.concept is very nice
5,"stickers, horses, what else do you need?","All I can say is that if your child loves horses and stickers, then this is the book for them! I gave this to my niece for Christmas and all other presenst went to the side! The pictures are so vibrant and there were a ton of stickers!"
1,Horses Sticker Stories,We were very disappointed with this book. If it didn't cost as much to send it back as the book itself we would've returned it. The pictures are bland and the text dull. There was no appeal in it for the kids.
2,"Good idea, lousy quality.","I've just received this sticker book and was disappointed to find out that none of the stickers will actually stick to the surface of the pages unless you use your own glue to make them stay in place. Apparently, the front page has a typo promising 75 ""reusable stickers"". Sorry folks, it's more like ""not usable"" once when it comes to try them.I'm sending it back."
5,This is a great CD.,"Ghoti Hook was one heck of a band. This CD was probably one of their best. It was just awesome punk music (some serious, some funny). Banana man was good, but this CD definately tops it. I would highly recommend it to anybody."
5,"Spanish Punk Band, That Rocks","These guys are an awesome punk band though not as good as mxpx, they still rock. They can play very fast and hard if they want to. This is my favorite CD by ""Ghoti Hook."" They have alot of good songs on this album, my favorite would have to be ""Dry Run."" And if you don't know ""Ghoti,"" is a phonic spelling for ""Fish."""
3,Have the quality problems been fixed?,"I have the original VHS tapes, and they are good.However, I've heard from many sources that the DVD reproductions are very DARK, to the point where all you can see is maybe the accordion.Does anyone know if this issue has been resolved yet? I'd like to buy the DVD versions, but not if they will be almost unusable."
2,Great story if you can get past the reader,"I have just started listening to books on tape, and was completely spoiled by Kate Nelligan's reading of my first, The Last Days of Dogtown. When I looked for another, I chose this one, read by Colleen Dewhurst, because I have always admired her work in film. Well, it was all I could do to make it through Babette's Feast, and I will pass on trying to listen to Sorrow Acre. Her voice just drones on and on, with little emotion or inflection; she sounds bored to death, and I couldn't wait for it to be over."
4,I saw the Welch Revival,I SAW THE WELCH REVIVALVery good history of the revival. Very encouraging! I recommend it to anyone who is hungry for more of God.
3,Brilliant art...story could be better,"This graphic novel started out extremely strongly. It had a unique feel to it, kind of like watching a Disney cartoon. The art is truly amazing. Meglia does some very interesting effects with colour and computer generation...it kind of reminds me of some of the effects that Tim Sale achieves, except where Sale's techniques make the art look simpler, here there is an opposite affect.The concept of the story, that of Jor El having launched an alternative plan to save Krypton is interesting. The opening pages draw you in quite nicely and some of the dialogue is laugh out loud funny. But somewhere in the middle it becomes very difficult to follow, kind of reminding me of a Chris Claremont X-men plot at its most convoluted. This is where it loses me a bit.Overall, I think the book is worth your time, if only for the art, which is truly unique and makes the book practically double as a coffee table book that you just want to flip through."
5,The Moffatts Rule!,"GGGGGRRRRRRREEEEEEEAAAAATTTT!!!! Besides Girl Of My Dreams being GREAAATT, Over The Rainbow is a NEW song, not found on their CD! BONUS!!! Cool! Go get this CD now!"
4,Aladdin just got some serious competition,"This game makes the Sega Genesis look better than it's worth. The story line is exactly as in the movie. You'll find yourself extremely impressed while using your animal powers. The music, which also comes from the movie, is shockingly entertaining. You'll find yourself caught dancing to it, until you realize what the heck your doing and stop any further embarrassment. The music actually matches the level!!! Amazing!!! lolYour now probably now wondering, if it's so good, why did you only give it a 4/5 overall? I'm going to make this as simple as possible. The game is short. I MEAN THE GAME IS S-H-O-R-T. What the... it only has 4 levels?!?!?!?! That's short even for the Sega Genesis! The madness!Other than that it's an extremely good game. Yet it's expensive due to it's rarity. Disney played it safe and didn't make that many copies to try and make sure they had some money left. BIG MISTAKE. They could have been rolling in the money."
2,False Prophet,"I bought because of all the Anne Rice references in her books, but I did not like him. Sorry to everyone else that I'm sure loves him. I like weird but he was just plain strange."
2,A sonic disappointment,This hissy monophonic recording (not labeled as such!) is suitable for only the most casual uncritical listening.
5,Brando was great,"Great acting, good movie. I saw it back in 1953, and still enjoyed every minute. Marlon Brando is wonderful and soi young."
1,Work/Life not living up to its title,"The book serves as a poor representation of both the content and the intent of the architect's work. Instead of compiling a monograph documentiing a body of work through text, representations (sketches, drawings, etc.), and photographs, the book presented little more than a compilation of photography and a bit of text at an obscenely large font. The only purpose of the publisher's selected method of composition was to ""pad out"" the book to over 200 pages. The same quality of information could be composed in a much smaller book and the content would not suffer."
3,"Great work, medicore images","There may be a 2G monograph out, but good luck finding it. W/T does amazing work, and this is probably the most comprehensive resource out there, albeit in black and white. The lack of plans and elevations is also unfortunate, making for a very impressionistic picture of very complex architecture. There is a nice mini-biopic (by Tod?) at the end describing in personal terms their journey through the world of architecture, and how they relate to each other. They've done some great work and it's disappointing that there's not a better monograph widely available."
3,Great works yet OK book,"I agreed w/ A reader's review. It's kind of disappointing and it should be printed in color. 2G had a better monogram, but it's discontinued."
5,Simply Amazing,"Though esoteric at times, the book beautifully displays the work of these visionaries... I highly recommend it."
2,No Claire + No Russ = A huge disappointment,"I was saving this book so I that I could look forward to more Clare and Russ, little did I know they would fail to show in this book of the series. I say series lightly because this book should not be included as part part of the Clare Fergusson/ Russ Van Alstyne mysteries. I am fairly new to the series and this was a huge disappointment since the characters I know and care about rarely appear. This book is peppered with minor characters and often less than plausible story lines.I am sad to say I put this was down. Ms. Spencer-Fleming's fascination with deer hunting and subesquent deer skining was very off putting. It's a shame she feels she has to resort to this type of false sensationalism after a noteworthy first novel.To Darkness And To Death lacked both style and substance and is a world away from what I grew to know and love in the first few books. My love affair with Clare and Russ is now over."
3,Spenser-Fleming's fourth book a disappointment.,Too much time and space devoted to minor characters and not enough focus on the two major ones. This crime novel suffers from a disproportionate emphasis on the timber industry.
3,Will this ever end?,"I have read Julia Spencer-Fleming's books 1 thru 3 and I have enjoyed them very much. I am now on page 161 of TO DARKNESS AND TO DEATH. I hope I can stick with it. If any one started this series with this book, I deeply pity them. There is always a book in a series that turns out to be the least favorite. So far I am guessing that this is the one. You can't expect perfection from an author. I will continue to plod through this and hope the ending finally makes it worth while. I still think this is a great series."
2,Skip this one!,"These mysteries have been somewhat entertaining but not great, however ""To Darkness and to Death"" has put me off Julia Spencer-Fleming, perhaps permanently. The characters, coincidences and ultimate conclusion are so contrived and unbelievable that I found myself getting angry while I read it. I almost just put it down but then I kept thinking she might pull it out of the depths; she didn't. One character gets kidnapped three times by three different people, all sorts of heretofore decent, if not brilliant, citizens turn to, or at least contemplate, kidnapping, murder and mayhem without a second thought. It's a terrible disappointment; Ms. Spencer-Fleming has dragged Clare & Russ through enough improbable circumstances, time to give them a rest!"
4,Verisimilitude,"Lots of people come at you fast so it helps to take notes, but it's a pretty good story. This is especially so because I live in NY State and all the actual locales are familiar. One death was bothersome, though, but I won't say who it was. The rest of them, well, we're better off without them. The one error I would point out for the sake of verisimilitude regards the Prius auto mentioned. It doesn't use keys, neither for the door nor for the ignition. Well, mine is a 2004. Perhaps the older models use keys. Maybe Julie needs to check some of this type of stuff out before writing. Picky, picky, I know."
2,A very long walk in the woods,"I agree with others who pointed out that the main characters are missing throughout the majority of this book. I found the book for the most part to be a long read. I have also found my patience with the relationship between Rev. Fergusson and Russ Van Alstyne at an end. Her character is always jumping in without thinking or thinking her way is best in police investigations where she has little experience. He finds her frustrating but, he's in love. We are to believe she is sincere in her vows with her church and yet she continues to have a relationship with a married man. In order to enjoy a book I need to like or find something redeeming with the characters. This is no longer the case with Ms Spencer Fleming's characters."
4,Very good!,"To Darkness and to Death: A Clare Fergusson and Russ Van Alstyne MysterySuper job of a book with believable characters and not lacking in romantic tension. The entire series is worth reading and is better read in sequence. To my way of thinking, each book gets better than its predecessor."
1,"Radio works, cassette does not work!!!!","the product looked very nice when I first opened the package, however, the first time I used it, the radio worked but the cassette ruined two of my tapes"
1,Poor quality and bad sound,Product is of poor quality and I think its seconds so poor in sound also. DOnt buy this product
3,Great for kids,"This is great for the younger child who really just wants to listen to their tapes and the radio. It wasnt meant to have the sound and quality that older kids or adults need. The price is great and kids under 10 would love to have it. Plus, how wrong can you go with a name brand that stands behind their product on top of it all?"
3,Okay But Could Be Better!,I got this Sanyo radio-cassette player as a free gift when I bought some audio books and that is what I mainly use it for. It's not the best radio/tape player but since I got it for free I can't complain too much about it and it is fine for listening to audio books and I really have no big complaints about it other then that it lacks things like auto-reverse and for some strange reason it only has a fast forward button and not a rewind button and that is a strange thing for a portable cassette tape player to lack! It's an okay tape player but My Sony Walkman is better because it has auto reverse and a rewind button!
5,Finally. A poker book for the rest of us...,"An excellent book that takes the home game where it should go. There is no other book designed to develop the home player's abilities in holdem to be able to walk into a casino and play on a respectable and knowledgeable level. The book is easy to understand and develops advanced topics easily for those new to the game. If you're either playing in a home game or thinking of starting one, this is the ideal book for you."
4,In response to Mark,"In response to Mark's review of this book, Mark doesn't understand REAL poker. Chicago, Baseball, Follow the Queen, and other silly card games may be fun but they are not REAL poker. If you want to play those silly games, you might as well play roulette or craps. REAL poker is about skill. This is the whole point of this book."
2,Not as useful as hoped,Not as useful as I had hoped. and it is only useful for a specific zoom. And it does not fit my newer Canon Powershot
5,A greag book for toddlers and young children,"This is a great book in the Eye Openers series. This book contains pictures and a short paragraph on each subject; kitten, duckling, leopard cub, wallaby, puppy, fawn and gorilla. My two chilren ages 2 and 4 just love this book."
5,top notch entertainer of kids' songs,"I am a retired K. teacher who had the honor of meeting Jim Valley at a workshop! I enjoyed him immensely!! I have misplaced his album, so I am now buying another for my Grandchildren!! I would love to see him perform again!! Thank you, Elaine Cutler"
5,Woah,"This album is pretty cool i liked it. It's is not a scary as the second one is, but just as good. Old school punk lives on. In audible vocals and blairing guitar, and speeding drums."
5,"It's official, Fabio Frizzi is king!!!","I have always enjoyed Fabios work, when I saw Zombie I just had to get my hands on the music from that awsome film. Then when I saw this, I was just amazed how great the music was, some of the songs might be abit better than this trashy gory film deserves, but then again a guy like Lucio Fulci only deserves the best for his films, I suggest you get this if your into horror movie soundtracks, not even! Get it regardless of your taste in music, there are some emotional tracks on this album, not to mention scary as well."
4,Shows great things in economic theory.,Fusfeld shows great aptitude in the great learning novel of economics and society today. This book shows that are wants are greater than are resources on earth today in our society.
1,A Serious Controversy About TRW,"A serious controversy has attended TRW ever since its publicaton. Specifically, the allegation is that over half of it is plagiarized. This charge was leveled not only by myself (who wrote the original manuscript from which much of TRW was taken) but also by respected academics, such as Sharon Presley, a retired professor of psychology who has her own books available on Amazon.[...]It is very disturbing to read long passages -- indeed, entire chapters -- under the name of someopne else, especially when you once considered that person a trusted friend and did everything in your power to help her professionally.I have no explanation for this outrage. You will need to ask Wendy McElroy that question. But I ask that you take a look at the evidence. It is overwheming.George H. Smith"
2,Waste of time,"The only reason I ordered this book was because a person from one of my LinkedIn groups recommended it. I'm guessing I gleaned about 10% of it as intellectual, reasonable information; otherwise, it was a waste of time. In one of the other reviews, the person writes of plagiarism. In her defense, Wendy cites many other authors and a wealth of resources along with numerous footnotes that I wouldn't agree with his assertion."
5,"great book, BUT get the TEACHING TORTS BOOK!!","I bought both the Mastering Torts and Teaching Torts book, and especially loved the Q & A format of the Teaching Torts book for review and class preparation.Teaching Torts is used by professors, including mine.You can find it on Half for a good price."
4,Wild Bill and George Brunies/Muggsy Spanier Swing,"Some outstanding Dixieland musicians make up this l947 live concert--Wild Bill Davison,George Brunies,Muggsy Spanier, Joe Sullivan, especially, however, some of the others are disappointing: i.e. Baby Dodds. It's reminiscent of the Eddie Condon live sessions, but Brunies tries to outshine his colleagues (Davison and Spanier). Some of the jazz is really hot, but some lacks power and improvisational originality. Some surface noise is somewhat distracting on the Spanier sides, so so much for digital remastering. All in all, it's a good enough period recording that I'm ordering Concert #2 as well, on Jazzology."
5,High Praises,"I gave this book to a family member and with each new chapter, she gives it high praises. She has even recommended it to a co worker who bought the book and loves it herself. Maybe I need to read this book."
3,Last two chapters worth the read,"The author's experience in trying to help a poor Vietnamese family educate two of their children is a classic lesson in how the good intentions of people from developed nations unwittingly run counter to the best interests of those in under-developed nations. We think that our money and largesse can help to solve the problems of the poor when, in fact, too often it makes things worse. Maria Coffey met some very interesting people living in Hanoi and she chronicles their perceptions in the closing chapters of the book. It provides insight into the continuing struggles that the Vietnamese people have in trying to hold onto the traditional values that have sustained their culture for thousands of years in the face of the new ""global economics"". Anyone from a developed western nation planning to travel to or live in an agrarian peasant-based culture should include ""Something of Value"" by Robert Ruark on their reading list."
1,A naiive and annoying book: read at your own risk,"I've just read this very naiive book on Vietnam by a Canadian couple who tried to travel around Vietnam in the mid '90s, without proper permits or planning, on boats. With typical Western arrogance, the couple showed complete disregard, ignorance and disrespect for the laws and customs of the country they were visiting and, as you would expect, got nowhere and ended up bussing and cycling most of the way from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. The book is an interesting insight into the ""backpacker"" psyche but very annoying as they put lots of people at risk helping them and getting them out of the messes they got themselve into, and they come across as incredibly stupid and naiive. The book's called ""Three Moons in Vietnam"", read it if you get the chance but on no account buy it, it wouldn't do to encourage these people financially in their stupid pursuits!"
3,First one defective,Had to get a new remote because the lock/unlock button on the original broke. The new remote would work intermittently and finally I returned for another which has worked well so far. Great return by Amazon and I really appreciated the service.
4,Works great on an older RS114 model,"I never liked the remotes that originally came with our RS114 remote starter. So when I saw this I knew I wanted to try it. As another person had commented, these remotes work perfectly with the older unit. Programming was very easy. On the RS114 you hold the brake through the whole process and just hold the start button on a working remote until you hear the parking lights flash once. Then push the stop button on the new remote. If it worked the parking lights flash 3 times which you'll hear from the relay clicking. Let off the brake and you're done. I like the rubberized finish on these remotes and they're easy to hold. My only real complaint would be the size of the unlock button which is really small and hard to push."
3,Buy a few.,"The amazon price is a lot cheaper than the Bulldog Security website, plus they charge over $10 for shipping, which really adds up. I am glad I found this product on Amazon. I installed a remote starter in 2006 and have been through about 3 of these so far, well the first two were the rectangular rendition. Stock up while you can. They may disappear."
1,Bulldog 4-Button Remote Keyless Entry for Cadillac.,"I was very disappointed in the my order. The Bulldog Keyless entry was received on time, but it did not have programming instructions, so it is useless to me. If it wasn't going to have instructions, or if I were not going to be able to program it, then I should have been told in the information that was available on the order site. Now I am at a loss as to what to do with it. I could simply send it back, but I don't feel like messing with it now."
2,past their prime,"it use to be i would look forward to a new cowboy junkies album and when ever i would buy it i was not disappointed. unfortunately i think those days are gone. in my opinion they have been going steadily downhill over the past several years. they still sound like classic 'junkies' but the songs just aren't as good. oh well - at least i still have caution horses, black eyed man, crescent moon, and lay it down to listen to."
3,Ok lens for the price,"I bought this on a whim because it was so large for so cheap. I'm still trying to find the best use for it, but I've gotten some decent images out of it. Used on my Pentax K10D, I find I get the best images out of it on a sunny day with a high shutter speed. I tried some night/tripod shots, and wasn't too excited about the results. Buy it for a cheap and lightweight lens to tide you over until you can afford one of higher quality."
4,Solid Computer Case,"The case arrived on time and in perfect condition. I had an older version not on wheels. The new case isn't made of all the fine quality material and features of the original, but it is fine for my needs. It doesn't have all the inner pockets of the non wheel version which was a disappointment, but not having to carry around the case is wonderful."
4,parts are fantastic; interesting and very worth while,Gre Brouwenstijn is utterly sublime as Sieglinde. Don't know why she is barely mentioned by other reviewers. Her signing in Die Walkure is worth the price of the entire set.There were things that rubbed me the wrong way but they were worth hearing as an interesting comparsion. Like Varnay less than Neilsen but one shouldn't listen to the same voices all the time...(though Gre Brouwenstijn is the best Sieglinde I've ever heard and I am extremely let down by listening to anyone but her (in the two recordings I have of her in this role)...she's even better in the later recording of the same role with Neilsen as Brunnhilde.)
2,Test Every RING by its Hojotoho!,"To decide on a RING, I have found that the way the Hojotoho! sequence is conducted provides an acurate test of the approach to the entire work. If it is powerful, then likely all else follows the same. Here (Disk 5) one can tell that the effect is not stellar, and if any portion of this cycle is to be stellar, this is it."
3,"Excellent cast, but...","I will be short since enough folks have described this set far more eloquently than I ever could. Of all the complete Ring Cycles I have for some reason this is the one that just does not jell for me. The cast is excellent (Varnay, Browenstjin, Windgassen, Hotter, etc), the acoustics must have been wonderful and the sound is good if somewhat muffled (I think that's my own problem). But...the conducting just doesn't come together for some reason. I have Kna's 51 ""Gotterdammerung"" and I love that one even at similarly broad tempi, but the cycle for '56 just fails to hold my interest. And of course there are those mistakes that unfortunately get more annoying with repeated listenings (again, my own problem). I have tried to listen to this over and over again, and still my attention wanders, unlike Furtwangler's Rome or Milan."
1,Sex Machines: Photographs And Interviews,"Nothing sexy about this book. And, you do not see anything even though there are photographs. Shows mostly homemade models."
5,Excellent introduction to writing,"I got this toy for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas, and couldn't be more pleased. This toy has sparked her interest in writing, and she is now asking how to make all sorts of words. Her writing has become very clear and she's excited at the prospect of writing.... The toy offers upper or lowercase letters, and shows you how to write both. In fact, the early levels show you both versions for identification. My daughter uses both upper and lower case letters (she mixes them randomly) but has no trouble understanding that there are two different ways to write one letter."
4,don't loose the letters!!!,my 2 1/2 year old likes this one pretty well only i can't let her play by herself because she will lose the letters!! i was doing so well at keeping up with the letters and putting it up and away after she was done playing with it.... i was lazy one day and we're now missing the O and D !!! we are still on the look out for it!!
4,LOVE IT!!,"My daughter got this in February for her 4th birthday. It has really helped her to learn to write her letters and she is even now spelling 3 letter words by herself. The only drawback is that it will accept any 3 letters as a word, even if it is just a ""sound"". Overall I think it was a great investment. She loves it and plays with it almost daily. It is durable..we take it in the car, to grandmas, etc. Her 1 year old cousin is even drawn to it and starting to repeat letter sounds with her!"
4,Great learning tool!,"Excellent toy! Letter sounds and voice are extremely clear. There are a variety of phonics games for a variety of learning levels. The writing strip is a plus, too, as is the digital demonstration of how to write the letters. My 4 year old loves it! It has definitely taught her to begin to read. She is already spelling 3 letter words on her own and beginning to read simple books thanks to the help of this toy. It's proven durable, as well, surviving several falls down the stairs and drops off the couch without any problems."
2,Good concept but could be made better,"The concept of this toy is a great idea for children not only learning their letters, but also learning to write their letters. However we were disappointed because this toy broke twice! Finally had to throw it out. The slider to clear the written letters broke first but my husband was able to fix it. Eventually, the whole slider broke again and the writing of letters was useless. Then the letters start not to work."
5,Just perfect!,"I recently bought this for our four year old daughter, who was just beginning to show an interest in her letters. I agree with the other reviewers about how nicely done this item is...It is durable, has several different settings to chose from (learn letter names, quiz on letter names, learn phonics, quiz phonics, spell a three letter word, etc.) It is nice to have so many setting to chose from! What I like most about this particular item is that it has a setting to chose capital or lower case letters. My daughter learns lower case letters at her Montessori school and so few of these type items even bother to show the lower case letters. This one gives you that choice. Its really been very popular in our house with our four year old and our two year old."
2,A good phonic Toy to learn your abc's,"I liked this phonic toy, Great for learing the alphabet. The only thing i didn't like is having the child write the letter on the screen and then push leap frog and hear ""Great job"" when the toy don't know if the child wrote the right letter. THE voice on the toy is great and very clear, it a good toys for beginers."
4,Fun for Awhile,Although my four year old daughter enjoys her leap Frog Phonics writing desk after only four months of mild use it is broken. The green erase button does not erase the print window which allows other word to be written on it. Great toy minus that one major item.
2,3 year old ignores this toy,"My 3 yr old ripped this toy out of the packaging and was very excited. Excitement lasted maybe 5 minutes, at which point he put it down and hasn't picked it up since :( Maybe it was the educational factor, or the lack of flash that many games have today, but I'm dissapointed in this purchase."
5,Great Educational Toy. As usual for Leapfrog toys. :),"My daughter was having a few issues with her writing, and this toy allowed her to work on the letters she needed help with and helped with making it fun for her. I am a huge fan of leapfrog toys, and this is another to add to that. :)"
3,"Educationally sound, but not enough ""thinking"" time","Although the games within this toy are educational, the timing of the verbal prompts are too fast. For example, during the ""write your own word"" portion of the game, the prompts are approximately every 5 seconds. After approximatley 4 prompts, the toy will turn itself off. This has become very frustrating to my 5 year old when he is trying to write a word and is not writing as fast as the prompts are coming. He still uses the toy, but not for long periods. Were I to buy another toy, I would try to find one that gives the child additional thinking and writing time."
4,Great for under 3,"I bought this toy at a garage sale thinking it was too advanced for my 22 month old twins. I thought it might get them a little more familiarized with their ABC's. To my surprise, one of my girls had her ABC's learned in no time. She spent days on end playing with it. One day while coloring I starting writing letters, and she was naming them all. My other daughter has a short attention spane and she has even picked up on several of the letters. It will certaily grow with them. I'll probably purchase a new one soon, as the writing area has seen better days. Other than that, it works great."
5,"ABC's, Phonics, Writing...it covers them all","This is one of the best phonics learning toys I've seen to date. It has different levels that allows the Phonics Writing Desk to 'grow' with a child. It's helped my 4-year-old son identify letters (upper and lower case), associate them with their sounds, it demonstrated the 'blending technique' that allowed him to sound letters out to make short, three-letter words. There is a quiz section, and an opportunity for him to combine his choice of letters to make words. The LCD display actually shows the letter as it is being electronically 'printed', so it was easy for him to follow and print it on the magnetic writing window.After about 2.5 years of almost daily use, the writing window does show a bit of normal ware, but it has proven to be a very durable, well-made product. It has become my gift of choice for 3 to 5-year-olds."
1,LEAP FROG UNRELIABLE IN MANY WAYS,I am here to let all you moms know..if you buy a leap frog toy and it does not work..DO NOT SHIP IT OUT OR HAVE THEM SEND YOU A NEW ONE..I SENT OUT MY 4 YR OLD SONS PHONICS DESK and i never got it back untill i called corporate and they are sending it back next day air.Leap Frog will never see my business again..PLEASE BE AWARE...
3,Boring,I think that this is a educational toy for children but is not pleasurable to look at so it would be apealing to the child considering so many toys look like this (boring).
1,Haven't rec'd. item,I've been waiting for this item for almost one month. Why advertise if you do not have it? I missed presenting tihis to the child because of this delay. I like the ideal of the toy therefore I'm still waiting patiently.
1,Boring to a Five-year-old,"Because it's marked ""3-7 years"" and becasue the other reviews sounded good, we bought this for our five year old. Mistake! Our child was not interested. The toy is really geared to much younger children (maybe ages 3 or early 4?). Our child was bored with it right out of the package, and it was way less than educational for this age group. We tried to give it away, but the other kids we knew didn't like it, either. (They were all older 4s and younger 5s.) Warning: This is a waste of money for 5 and up."
5,Great Learning Tool,"I just recently purchased this educational tool for my 4 year old daughter. My daughter has been writing her letters backwards and my husband and I have been trying to teach her the correct way to write them. After one week of using the Phonics Writing Desk we already see an improvement. Just last week we started her on upper case letters and already she has developed a better sense of how to begin forming the letters correctly.We figure after four weeks of practicing on her upper case letters for an hour a day she will build more confidence in writing.Before purchasing this tool, we began teaching her three letter words and she became excited when she recongnized most of what she had already learned was programmed in the writing desk.We are very happy with this product. Although, we do have a hard time keeping the pen stable within the unit while on trips."
2,Nanny's Opinion,"Gave this to my four year old granddaughter. I watched her for a while and saw it really was not what I was looking for since the writing area was too small for beginning writers. Also it takes too long a time to go from step to step. My granddaughter liked to hear the sounds of the letters, but did not like writing them on a very small space and this was discouraging to her. I would make it more a writing toy by writing on a larger area and leave off some of the sounds. My experience is all of my six grandchildren enjoy more learning toys with actual hands on and less having to listen to the toy for ""instructions, correct and incorrect"" and also trying to figure out what the toy ""said"""
5,History,"My husband and I are both of Native American heritage, but entirely different tribes. We enjoy learning about one another's culture. We have both thoroughly enjoyed this book."
2,Over-priced book compared to other books priced the same,This book is over-priced for its limited contents. The true value of this book should be about $10 - $12.
3,Dry Document,"This dry inventory of the Holy See is likely well researched, and accurate. Lost though is any sense of compassion. Even the low wit is obvious and, and telegraphed. I read this as the drama of JPII unfolded, and thus provided to me a unique perspective. I think I should pass. The Throne over humanity seems to be taking a backseat to the audio and video bytes that accompany tragedy. The shoes of the fisherman should not be trivialized for ratings. Walsh's tour of Catholicsim left me empty, and unenthused. 3 stars for the depth of his research."
4,Why is this book so expensive?,"Hi everyone, I'm very confused. why in the world is this book so expensive? I've read several books including Hiro Onodas but I'm baffled as to why a copy of this book is selling for $449. Is it a signed copy?Thanks!"
3,Jesse Ed Davis,The muscianship on this album is superb. Look at the list of players. It's too bad Jesse Ed Davis did not have a good singing voice.
3,"Hot Production, Okay lyrics","Ok first thing you must know about this cd is that the lyrics really compare nothing to those of the Diplomats, however, with that saying, their production is just as hot. I dunno if it was the heatmakerz (some of the best producers in the biz) who did some of the beats but they sound dope as hell either way. If your gonna buy this cd then you should really only buy it if you just wanna hear some hot beats for influence or watever."
3,An aiight CD,"This is a second rate CD from the Dip set crew. After hearing the brilliant single ""Purple City Byrdgang"" which is one of my Favorite songs at the moment. Not much lives up to the brilliance of that First single. The beats are nice all the way through the album. But even Lil Jon raps greater then these guysLyrics 4.5 Production 9 Replay 7 Entertainment 8"
3,Production is like WHOA!!!! Lyrics are So-So,"Let me start out by saying I rep Dip's to the fullest. That being said, I am not completely impartial. But overall, I would say this is a decent album. As stated in the title, production is crazy!!! The beats on this album are unbelievable. I heard a lot of nice tracks Sheist the Emporor and The Don Bishop laid down on a few of their mixtapes so I'm not suprised by how tight the beats are. But Lyrically, the album is kinda suspect. The lyrics really are nothing I haven't heard before. Un Kasa came off strong on a few tracks, but other than that its pretty bland. I like Sheist's voice and delivery, but his lyrics don't knock me out of my seat. I would reccomend the album off the strength of how tight production is, but lyrically its not gonna blow you away........."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"Velour 100's Fall Sounds is nothing short of amazing. The music is tight in some spots, chaotic in others but done beautifully. Amon's vocals are captivating and hypnotic and add a special element to Trey's music. This is a truly special album."
3,Great on Instruction Poor on explanation,"Look this book is OK; hence the 3. Chapter 9 is worth the money for the book alone. Now if you have little or no experience with PHP you are going to look at the code that Dreamweaver creates and you are going to be totally lost because the book does not explain the code that is created by Dreamweaver. None, Notta, Zilcho, not even a smidgen. Now that is my only real complaint. I wish I could recommend another book but I am not aware of another one. Overall this book has a lot of good information but gets a hard hit for lack of code explanation. Good luck."
1,Mac users avoid this book,"This book's advertising is misleading. Except for the appendix, the book completely ignores instructions for the Macintosh user. As a result, I have literally spent weeks searching for the necessary adjustments to accomplish the demos on a Mac. This book should be advertised as for Windows users only. It should be an excellent text for them."
1,FaceLift excercises,"This book is a joke. The stick figure drawings do not at all convey how to do the exercises and the exercises themselves are absurd! (Or at least what I can figure out the excercises to be). The excercises in this little book can be compared to trying to make your eye lashes grow by batting your eyes. It's amazing that any publisher would publish a book such as this. Oh yeah, none would. Don't waste your money."
4,a great tell of a great war between a country,"I loved this book, because I love the civil war and was sick of all fictional books about it. when I picked up this book and started to read I could not put it down. It's one of the best books I've ever read"
5,"A simply, beautifully told and moving memoir.","""The View from Alger's Window"" is a memoir, simply and beautifully told, of a sensitive, perceptive boy growing up in the most unusual of circumstances. In my work as a therapist, I quest for ways to help patients turn adversity to advantage. I found tremendous value in the story of how Alger Hiss, imprisoned at the height of his career, saw jail as a place for ""learning and growing,"" not a place to become bitter. Tony Hiss's story of his own psychological development is also revelatory-how he became emotionally frozen, how he created his own identity, how he grew up in the shadow of Alger Hiss and also in his father's light. Let the controvery over Alger Hiss's guilt or innocence rage elsewhere. Tony Hiss's story is a unique one, uniquely told."
1,Self-delusional,"Gee, isn't it nice that Tony Hiss loved his dad. I just wish his dad had loved his country. The evidence is clear, despite what some obstinate liberals think, that Alger Hiss was a traitor. He spied for a totalitarian state that murdered millions of its own citizens, putting loyalty to communist theory ahead of the interests of his fellow citizens."
1,Have you ever read something that provides NO INFORMATION?,"This is one of those books. In addition to not being a communist(DO YOU EXPECT ANY OTHER CONCLUSION FROM TONY HISS?), did you know Alger loved Picasso and VanGogh? He also loved his family and wrote letters from Lewisberg penitentiary -- you don't say! B L A H ! ! ! !"
1,The Title/Description/Price Are The Wrong Bike,"I bought this ""amazing"" deal and wound up with the Incline model. The Incline is the bike that is pictured and is regularly sold at this price because it has much cheaper components/frame. I am trying to get this bike shipped back to FogDog so that I can continue with my search for a good woman's mountain bike.I wish that Amazon would correct this mis-advertising soon so that more people don't have to go through the disappointment and headaches."
2,low-end bike for high price?,"Based on the advertising ($1800 bike for $200), it seemed like this would be a good quality bike. Although the frame seems adequate, there is not a lot of suspension. The bottom bracket bearing, kickstand, seat post, lack of tapped holes for a rear rack, and other details say this bike is worth $200, not much more."
3,It could be better,"Mr. Kevorkian it's definitely the best remixer ever. He has a realy good taste and always maintain the structure of the song and not create a different one. Anyways , this selection could be better, I missed great mixes such as This charming man - The smiths, Girl in trouble - Romeo Void, Lucky in love & Just another night - Mick Jagger, Something Real- Mr. Mister, etc.."
1,A Rolie Polie Christmas,I was not impressed with this dvd. I purchased this one and rolie polie olie : Olie Winter Wonderland. This one only had three episodes on it and was not very long. Olie Winter Wonderland is way better and has more episodes. I would recommend buying Olie Winter Wonderland over this video. I would also not recommend buying both of them because they have the same episodes with the exception that Olie Winter Wonderland has more. If I would have know that this video had the same episodes as the other I could have avoided the trouble.
4,Great,Joe Christman's North to the Future is like putting simple and beautiful together to get wonderful. It's a must for anyone that likes soft guitar with the alternative shift.
3,Film Favorites...NOT!!!!!,"I don't know who thought to lump these movies together, but they got it all wrong. I've been a huge Whoopi fan since her unforgetable acting debut in ""The Color Purple"". While I've been waiting with baited breath to see ""Clara's Heart"" finally get its due and be released here in the States on DVD (thank you!!!!), why link it to these other forgetable titles? ""Made In America"", ""Bogus""...are you kidding me? If they wanted to compile a Whoopi collection why not focus on her dramatic roles; the ones that truly compliment ""Clara's Heart such as ""Sarafina"" and ""The Long Walk Home"" both great and equally underrated movies. I guess ""Corrina Corrina"" falls in line, but I still think the choice of movies could have been better. Luckily ""Clara's Heart"" is worth the price of this collection by itself."
5,Whoopi Goldberg Collection,4 movies for a great price. Corrina Corrina and Clara's Heart are two of my favorite Goldberg movies. Great for family viewing and discussion.
4,Whoopi Goldberg,Thank youPackaging OKWell received this offer with 4 different movies with Whoopi GoldbergI was looking for a long time for these.
4,Whoopi fun,"If you are are a fan of Whoopie's this is a must have. Her performances are great! Understand why not major box office successes, but don't let that stop you. Bogus had surprisingly believable performances by all."
4,Poulan Pro Gas Blower,"Good workhorse leaf blower - plenty of power! I was surprised that I can use it at less than full throttle for many blowing tasks. Haven't yet tried the vacuum/mulching function. Only negative is that starting usually requires more ""one-pull"" - hot or cold."
1,One word about poulans; garbage.,"Buy another blower this one is a ""bic lighter"". Worked fine for about 40 hours and then just died. Called and serviced just like the service center recommended. Still wouldn't start, no spark. Risked replacing the coil/magneto and still never started again. Ended up being days out of the 2 year warranty, too bad. My local service center informed me that the Poulans are junk and not worth repairing. Spend the extra $$$ and get an echo or troy bilt. One word about Poulans; garbage. I also have a Poulan chain saw; requires chain adjustment every 10 minutes of use. The chain saws are also complete garbage. I really rate it -4 stars."
1,Poulan Pro 25cc gas blower,"I bought this gas blower in August, used it maybe 4 times and now the dang thing wont come to life at all.Went through the trouble shooting, did everything exactly as noted and the stupid thing still wont start.Checked the spark plug, looks like new. Thought I might have flooded the unit, did exactly as it stated andstill no luck. I really liked having the gas blower as I hate dragging extension cords everywhere. Temptedto take this back to Meijer and get a different model. What a piece of crap. If I was Poulan, I'd be embarrassed to put a model like this out for sale..."
1,Poulon don't honour their warrantry,"Had this machine as a gift in November 2006 - bought 3 cartons of Poulon's own special two stroke oil. Mixed first carton with one gallon of gas and machine worked well. Mixed second carton with one gallon of gas - seemed to be working ok, but 3/4 of the way through the mix the machine stopped - totally seized. Under 2 year warrantry delivered on Poulon's instructions to local repair shop. Got a call after 3 weeks - engine seized and useless - oil problem - not covered by warrantry. Explained that I only used Poulon two stroke oil - repairer said he had known of machines seizing even with correct oil/gas mix and that he would contact Poulon. Gave then two weeks then rang back - still hadn't heard from Poulon. I've now been without the machine for approx 6 weeks. Wouldn't touch another Poulon product with a barge pole."
2,Ignition Module bad after one year-Loud-Heavy-Does have good blowing power,"This blower received as a gift and was thrilled as I have a huge yard. I used my new 2007 model in the fall of 2008 and was really happy with the unit. Worked great, blew awesome and was happy I had it. Then came 2009, the unit was stored as should be with all fuel drained, and come spring a new plug and fresh gas. WON'T START!!!! Took it to a small engine repair place who sells this product paid $35 bucks just to look at it only to be told the ""Ignition Module"" is bad and it would cost more to repair then it would be to purchase a new blower. I have written to Poulan o see if there have been recalls or any issues on this in regards to this machine. If I hear anything I will post it.Very disappointed!I do reccomend wearing ear protection due to this is a loud unit.This is not an item for poeple that have a hard time holding things for a long period of time as this is a heavy unit."
1,"""If"" only it would start!","I have plenty of lawn equipment and well versed on how to start an engine. This blower is great if you could only get it started! I went looking on the internet and I found I was not alone! No it is not the gas/oil, no it is not the carb......... I have a two lawn mowers, 2 weed wackers, 2 blowers and guess which one is the newest and will not start? The only reason I even try to start it is because it works great when it runs. But that is only on Leap Year! Do not say you were not warned! If someone said here is a new one for 25 dollars.... I would give them 5 dollars and say it is going to be worth me watching you start it after you have used 4 or 5 times."
1,NEVER EVER EVER EVER buy Poulan,"First of all, every piece of Poulan equipment I have owned is a piece of junk.On this specific model, I just figured out why I couldn't get it to run for more than 10 seconds. It seems the gasoline intake tube is now only 1/2 inch long. Why? because the rest of the tube has been eaten away into a semi congealed mass of goo from sitting in the gas/oil mix. In other words Poulan used a material designed to sit in the gas tank that gets melted away by gas. BRILLIANT!"
2,Poulan Pro is a piece of CRAP,"I have had this Poulan Pro for going on the third year now. It always started relatively easy, 2 to 3 pulls. When it tried to start, switch from full to half choke and it was running.At times it would not run at full speed unless it was set to half choke. Would run slower at no choke.Whenever the weather got cool. I am guessing around 50 degrees or lower, the pull cord return would not work properly. As it got colder, the return was less. That left me to try to start it with a partial pull.Last week, I witnessed what several other people have with this model. It started as usual. Ran for a while and quit without warning. I checked the gas and it was OK. Haven't been able to start is since. No sign of life at all. Must be the infamous ignition coil failure that this model is prone to."
1,Poulan Pro Blower/Vac - Junk,"I have owned this ""Poulan Pro Blower/Vac 25cc 210MPH"" for 6 weeks and have been able to start it twice out 9-10 attempts. I am tired of fooling around with this piece of junk. I am taking it back and will never purchase a Poulan product again."
1,Poulan leaf blower not good,"The Poulan Leaf blower is a bad product. I purchased one from Lowe's and the cord would not retract so I took it back. Lowe's exchanged it and I was able to get the second one started, but discovered several flaws. It blows CO2 exhaust directly into your face when used to suck up leaves. The nozzle always gets jammed with leaves due to the cone design. I bought it because of the advertised 460cfm power but it does not seem to have much power. It is so heavy when used to suck up leaves, it made my back hurt. The back design vents up not horizontal, so leaves tend to jam, and you have to have a screwdriver to remove the blade cover once you remove the nozzle."
2,Lasted a couple years,"Like many others here mine worked fine for about 2 years. Then in the middle of the fall season it just refused to start. Cleaned air filter, cleaned/gapped plug, changed fuel - nothing. I'm assuming I lost compression the way it is pulling. Not worth fixing. So for about [...] a season I rented this thing - not a good deal.The vac inlet is too short and the design is awkward when you get the bag partly full. I bought this one thinking it would be OK due to the Poulan name. Last time I buy Poulan."
2,Shocking experience,"The blower works well as a blower not a sweeper and certainly don't buy for the vacuum feature. The vacuum is powerful enough, but it didn't take long before my back was hurting because of how it had to be held. It was also difficult to manuver.Worst part is when using as a vacuum it repeatedly shocked my hand. Static electricty? Not sure but I returned after three attempted uses."
3,Poulan PRO 25cc Blower review,"Not as powerful as previous weedeater (similiar) blower I owned and purchased this one to replace. Arrived, started and ran as advertised. Good blower."
1,Broken in the box,The blower came sealed and already broken in the box. The defect was so obvious they must have idiots packing these items. I tired of returning these products to these fools. The gromit from the pull cord was out of the holder. You have to take the entire machine apart to fix it. Shop somewhere else! J Romeo
1,Poulan Pro leaf blower/vac is JUNK!,"I owned a Poulan leaf blower/vac for about 7 years before it bit the dust.So since I had good luck with the previous one I purchased a new one.The new model Poulan Pro is absolutely junk.It is not made as well as the old model and not as easy to use. After using it an hour or so,I went to refill the gas again but it would not stay running when I pressed the throttle. I fought and fought with it but could not keep it running. I happened to look down at my coat and realized the blowervac had burnt a hole about 4 inched in diameter in my coat and melted the gloves and ear plugs that were in the pocket!!!! I am taking this peice of junk back,calling to company to make a claim for reimbursement of my coat and will never buy a Puolan Pro again. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!"
2,Save your money,"This is the first time I've ever taken the time to write a review online so please take note. I've owned this leaf blower for 18 months and have used it twice. In that time it has been very hard to start, but not as hard as it is now. Yesterday as I was trying to start it to clean up the yard when the cord which I noticed was becoming fraid completely snapped after about 5 pulls. Now I keep this in my garage out of the weather and have only had it started twice in 18 months. CHEAP!"
2,Two seasons and dead (or so I thought),"I bought this blower two seasons ago and it worked perfectly until yesterday when it stopped abruptly. I always insured that the oil mixture was 40:1 or better. So I didn't fear the piston seized, unfortunately it did. So I started shopping for it's replacement here on Amazon and read the poor reviews about this blower. Figuring I had nothing to lose, I removed the sparkplug and sprayed a lot of WD40 into the cylinder. I let it sit overnight and I still could get the engine to turn over by pulling the rope starter. As a last resort I stuck a long screwdriver into the spark plug hole and tapped the piston with a hammer. It worked! The engine fired right up. It smoked badly for a few minutes while burning off the WD40, but it runs great. Fortunately for me, I am not shopping for it's replacement... at least for now."
1,Cheeeep Junk Don't Buy,"2 strikes your out First one lasted 6 hours and lost compression called the Vendor I bought it from and they said"" throw it away and they sent another one free of charge! Good News-- NO the second one lasted two hours! Some history - I've raced 2cyl go karts for years and do my own engines!**************SAVE YOUR $$$ PAY $50 MORE FOR AN ECHO ********"
3,Nice Power Head. Vac tube too short,Agree strongly with previous reviewer about the length of the vacuum tube. It's too short. One must bend over to bring the end near the ground to vaccuum anything up. In a few minutes you'll have a backache. Otherwise the unit is fine.
2,Died after 2 years,"I used the blower and vac pretty regularly for about 2 years, it did just fine. It wasn't a problem getting started, but I really had to give it an aggressive go, I'll admit I am probably more fit that the average Tom that's gonna pull on the cord. My wife couldn't start this thing even after I had it running, no way, no chance. Now in its third year the sucker is done and done. It began losing power and quickly declined until the motor gummed up. I have fixed up a gummed up motor on an old Saab and Yamaha boat engine, and I know not to even bother with this thing, not worth the time, money, or efforts to fix it...this puppy is shot. No doubt it is built for a planned death after x number of hours. That is what you get these days, a cheap price, and a machine you'll replace in 3 years. Don't tell me you thought it was gonna run forever, its not the 1950s."
5,20 years + of outstanding antmusic,by far the best collection of ant music out there.plenty of ant favorites plus some very hard to find classics also if you were lucky enough to get a early copy of this it came with a live concert cd this is a must for all fans everywhere.............
2,Sounds compressed and tinny,"These are great fun songs, and they sounded good on MTV in the 1980s (cheap TV speakers)I don't know if it's due to the original production quality, or poor reproduction in the CDs they're selling today,but the sound quality was disappointing.In ancient times recording studios sometimes used to EQ recordings with cheap TV speakers and AM radio in mind.I bought 3 Souxie and the Banshees CDs at one point and they were the same way.I would keep my ears open for a remastered series one of these years."
5,ONE OF THE BEST!,"NOT SURE WHY HE WASN'T A SUPERSTAR, MAYBE TOO EARLY FOR HIS TIME! SURE BEATS THE HELL OUT OF RAP-CRAP!!"
4,Good value for the price,"Not a bad deal for a basic, fun wig that did what it needed to do for me and was very useful."
5,Just what I needed,The product came on time and as expected and was perfect for the intended use. The quality was good and made for an excellent end product.
5,An Excellent Book,"This book offers an excellent introduction to Biodiversity and natural history. Ideal for children ages 8-12, it will appeal to nature, animal and plant lovers of all ages! Images and text weave a wonderful story about life on Earth, while presenting issues and concepts in a thoughtful, approachable way. A real must for educators...every classroom and school library should have a copy!!"
4,Tree of Life,Tree of Life is an excellent resource book on nature. Children are able to view the table of contents and easily find information. The illustrations are drawn in detail giving a realistic appearance. I think this book would come in very helpful when an early grade child is doing a research report.
4,Cool,"It is very coolBy the way, this is my favourite book.{It is also a 2005 Silverbirch Award Book- Canada or Ontario or qch}"
5,A must read!,"This is a great firsthand account of Uganda's change from kingdoms through British colonialism and Amin. It focuses mostly on the kingdom of Toro in Western Uganda and Lady Bagaya's role in one of the most pivotal points in its history and her own personal life. She was a model, actress, princess, ambassador, lawyer. It is sad that this book is out of print as it is a must read for students of Africa and Women's studies. Even if her autobiography is taken with the appropriate grain of salt, she is definately one of the most important women in African history. When I met her she impressed me immensely. This book is almost identical to her ""Odyssey of an African Princess"" book but it includes less stuff about her husband. It should be required reading in so many subjects: African history, women's studies, political science."
4,Mama Bear,"I have stubborn sun spots/melasma and I was hopping for a cure, it didn't yet but I have been using this every other day it makes my skin a little dry and it does dries my pimples thats good enough"
5,Excellent book,Full of proven stats that give a great understanding of the different aspects of horse racing.
2,outdated,the angles in this book are no longer profitable if they ever were and the formulas in the back of the book no longer are profitable. i have applied the angles in this book to tests on my computer database software over thousands of races.save your money.
3,for everyone that loves MxPx this is a must,This CD is great you must have it if you like MxPx all the other MxPx are Awsome too
3,Interesting Choice of Songs to Cover,"This CD is loads of fun, even if you don't know all of the songs. DRUM MACHINE JOY is probably my favorite, and I'm not even sure why. The original version of that song was done by probably the cheesiest techno-pop-whatever bands, Joy Electric, but was turned into a very successful pop-punk song. I still don't get the lyrics, though. Another funny decision was to record a song by the Cootees (NO BRAIN), which is a band that both Mike and Tom are in. So, basically, it sounds just like the Cootees.Anyway, I don't have much more to say about this CD, except how many bands does it take to cover TAKE ON ME?p.s. SUMMER OF '69 is rad. My band covered it. Trust me, it's easy to do. And fun."
5,Totally Fun!,"I first heard this CD in the dressing room during our musical and knew i just had to have it! I finally got around to buying it and I am so glad that I did. These are some of the most fun songs I have ever listened to and MXPX does a great job covering each one. This is fun and unique and a great CD, especially for the car. And most of all it's just excellent music! I can't wait to hear more from MXPX."
5,Fantastic read - hard to put down!,Am searching for second book!! This is a great read was well written throughout
4,Great for wildlife photos....,"I have used this lens for the closeups of birds,deer and other wildlife that tend to run when you get too close for a shot. Also closeups of flowers are nice. I used it on my Nikon Coopix 990, it works with the 900 series, 775, 885 and Sony 37mm camcorder. Unfortunately I can't use it on my new camera. It takes nice photos, you need to use screen for centering shot. The only thing I have found that keeps it from being a 5 star item is that it really needs to be set on a tripod for stability when shooting to have clean clear pictures, as my hands can't hold it steady. It does have a tripod adapter."
5,Easy Glider,"I've used this product for years and have loved it. I use lip liner and the product allows the liner to glide right on. It also prevents feathering or bleeding, which is why I started using the product in the fist place. I don't know why stores don't carry it any more, at least I haven't been able to find it. So I decided to check on line and there it was. It's basically the same product, but now there is a scent to it that I'm not thrilled about. It's like a coconut scent, but it's too sweet smelling for my taste. However I feel the product glides on even smoother then before so I'm still a fan."
1,not a lipstick base at all,This looks like the waxy lipstick base that Boots no7 used to make and has annoyingly been discontinued. Unfortunately this is just a very greasy salve and so not at all suitable for invisibly lining the outside of the lips in order to stop lipstick bleeding. If you outline your lips with this you look as it you have just been eating very greasy food and forgotten to wipe your mouth!Lipstick also just slides of it too. I wish I hadnt bought several of these as it was a complete waste of money.
2,Demensions are deceiving,"Product features state: ""This Red and Blue Macaw measures 4 L x 3.5 H (10.2 x 8.9 cm)""The length from beak to tail is correct as stated however the height is not quite 1 1/2"" from the feet to the highest point on the parrot. Dont know what ruler they were using but it is a lot smaller than you are led to believe."
4,size of model,"The bird seems smaller than I expected, but I still love him. I am disappointed with his painting. He likes like he has some mistakes at his beak. I wish these tiny animal models would have a ruler or a hand with the picture. I am not good at reading measurements and being able to visualize the size of the model."
1,I just don't see it.,"Caitlin annoys me. She makes it sound like non-Christians cannot have morals or look beyond people's surfaces.As an agnostic, I can safely say that this is not true... in one of these books, Caitlin needs to learn the social lesson that all people are basically the same, with feelings, thoughts, and morals, even if they are different than hers. She needs to grow up. She's 17, for Zeus's sake!(This book is just so... urgh. )"
4,Good book,"The second in many books about Caitlin O'Connor, and just as good, if not better, than the first. Again, the only problem I had is that I felt like there was way too much drama, and morals that Caitlin learns about her life. Morals really aren't a bad thing to learn, though, so I guess it's all right."
5,Diary of a teenage girl (book 1),"When i first got this book, i read the first chapter and endded up liking it so much that i read the whole book in one night! it is a great and inspirartional book and i give it 100 stars!!"
4,"look for a ""like new"" used copy","I was turned off by the price, so I got it for half off used. The artwork is beautiful! The book is very handy for looking up lyrics from a certain song, especially b-sides. The songs are listed in alphabetical order. It is a bright addition to my tori collection.""You don't need my voice girl you have your own"" - Bells For Her, Tori Amos..."
3,Good but...,... this would be better if there was sheet music to accompany it. I don't just want to read her lyrics; I want to play her music. I think this is a book for Tori Amos fans only.
5,Great for brain development,"This is an amazing book !!! Full of great tips and ideas and ways to help your baby's brain develop fully. The first time I read it, my son was under a year, now he is thriving in an acclerated school program at age 11. I bought more copies for each of my friends that had babies too."
4,Great music,"This style of music is not usually what i would listen to.But i'm a mad Seekers fan.So i was curious to hear what this sounded like.And i was not disappointed.This is the style of music she likes and it tells me something about her.That she released music that she likes,and wasn't trying to get the number one song on the charts.It was music she felt comfortable with.And you can see why,her voice realy suits that type of music.There is that old fasioned sound from the 20's and 30's,and its very interesting music.I prefur her in the Seekers,but listening to her solo releases gives you an idea of what music she realy likes.For people who like this style of music you wont be disappointed,and its very different from what the Seekers did.Amazon dont seem to have her latest Dvd release of her Diamond tour 2003.She sings lots of her favourites on that as well as plays the piano.If your a Seekers fan this worth getting.Its quality music."
1,"too small, cannot charge it","I got this a while ago, the display is too small and I cannot charge it. It always has to be connected to the computer to work!"
2,Gets hot in use and seems to be cheaply made,"It does charge the phone well enough, but I wouldn't leave it on for extended periods."
3,Smokey Bear,This bear arrived smelling very heavily like cigarette smoke. It took weeks to air it out enough before I could give it to my toddler. Not what I look for in a toy.
4,"For loyal fans, great concert footage & audio & interviews","A great collection for the CAN enthusiast, the package includes 2-plus hours of bootleg-quality concert excerpts from 1971 to 1977. The performances are fantastic and intense, but the rarity of these recordings is offset by the primitive sound quality of the source (bootleg tape recordings by a friend of the band). The book is an excellent read, though the fact that it is 500 pages is offset by the fact that the text is repeated in triplicate - english, french and german. Interviews and in-depth discussion with all the members, the history of CAN, the philosophy behind the music, etc... The video highlights several video taped performances, interviews, movie excerpts, CAN studio footage and over an hour's worth of a CAN concert. An excellent video over 2 hours long. Already out-of-print, I've seen the used prices skyrocketing, as usual, with such a collector's set. Hopefully SPOON/MUTE will re-issue this box set."
3,not 'all that',I didn't think it was all that great. I had a hard time maintaining my balance. I wish I hadn't spent all that money.
3,A good one,I got a good work out and it was easy to follow. The music is a tad corny but I didn't buy it for the music.
5,A workout that you can't miss,"I did these workouts for a month and a half, and I noticed a small difference. These two workouts are just right for beginners. They also have a smooth flow in thw way they make the workouts. I definitely reccomend this to anyone who wants a good workout."
1,Falls short of the hype,"Prior to purchasing the Tae-Bo beginners video, I spent a lot of time reading the feedback online. After seeing the mixed reviews that are out there, I decided to try the videos for myself before passing judgement. I cannot believe this workout video has received the national attention that it has! I admire Billy Blanks strong marketing/PR strategy efforts but feel that this video falls very short of the hype. The video production quality itself is very poor- Surprising considering the $35 price tag and the workout itself is anything but the motivating, fun workout it is advertised to be. I am in the process of taking Billy up on his money back guarantee to invest in a better workout video. I would recommend to anyone considering this video to either rent it or borrow it from a friend before making the purchase and having to return it as I do."
3,Where's the beat?,"I like Billy Blanks, the concept of a kick boxing workout, and also all the various levels of age and fitness of the people in his ""class."" But I did not like these videos (I have all four) because the moves do NOT fit the music and the music is terrible! He counts off his moves at arbitrary times that have nothing to do with the beat or the phrasing, which is distracting and annoying if you have any rhythmic understanding. If you don't care about music, then the moves do provide a tough workout, but if you're like me, you definitely need a rockin' beat to help push through.Also, an additional caveat -- I had to stop using these videos because I kicked my two year old daughters (twins)! These are not great if you have small children."
2,This is potencially dangerous,"I've only tried a few video workouts, but I already can tell you Tae Bo is NOT one of the best ones. The warm-up neck exercises doesn't feel safe at all, the workout is definitively not easy on your back, and after the most intense routine of the basic workout, he drastically tries to bring you to a cool-down; and to top it all, the music (! ) is B-A-D. This is just a well-advertised, potencially harmful workout. The idea seemed good, but the reality isn't. I don't know Billy's credentials, but it really looks like he believes that because he can do some Tae Kwon Do, he is qualified to design a workout. Well, seems like he's not."
2,No Kudos!,"Billy Blanks seems like a sincere and likeable guy, but he still has a lot to learn about delivery and cueing. I'm still trying to figure out why all the hoopla. After watching this over-priced video set, these words from Oscar Wilde come to mind: Popularity is a sure sign of mediocrity."
1,Too Difficult!!,"This video is so fast going. I lose my breath so quickly. I know everybody loves it, I don't blame them. It's just not for me I guess."
5,Awesome Total Body Toning and Cardio Workout,"I have purchased all 4 tapes and the instructional video is very well prepared. I have been using the Basic tape for only 2 days and love it. I wasn't expecting to sweat so much because it's a Basic tape but the first time I used the Basic tape, I was dripping w/sweat. I plan to continue using the Basic tape for another 5 days to complete a full week and then I will move on to the Advanced tape and also try the 8-Minute Tape. So far It's Great!! My 9-year old daughter also works out with me using the Basic tape and she loves it!! You Go Billy!!!"
5,The most enticing work out available,"I have many different workout tapes, but I want to work out with this one. Billy Blanks makes you want to get out of bed and get the day started right. After the first week I could already begin seeing results. This one is for every body. Thanks Billy for putting this together."
1,The work out is not long enough,I was extremely dissapointed in the Billy Blanks Tae Bo video set. The cardio section of the work out is not long enough for a good heart rate.
2,Not what I expected. Prepare to be let down.,"I eagerly anticipated receiving my Tae Bo video and popped it in as soon as I got it. I don't see where it is anything special. I had a hard time following it, and I guess I was expecting more. Not only was I somewhat let down, I also am experiencing extreme neck and shoulder pain which I attribute to this workout. I followed the instructions as closely as possible, paced myself,and did the warm up and cool downs. Unfortunately, something went wrong because I just returned from my doctor where I needed to get some muscle relaxers."
2,"Don't believe the hype, this is overrated.","Although fun and fast-paced, this workout video is not based on sound fitness moves and may cause injury to joints and muscles, especially knees. I used this video (beginner and advanced) for 1 month and am now suffering from knee injuries. I attribute it to this video. Since I changed my workout, my knee pain has subsided."
1,"i have , instruction, basic, 8 minute workout and advance",Man it's the best! i find it really kewl and i do some now i'm in shape! i do weiths tea-bo and i reall like if i got some power! One thing don't be lasy!it's not by being lasy you'll have the power the fitness it's by beleiving in your self!
4,This is a fun workout!,"I've been doing Tae-Bo since February, and the basic workout is a lot of fun. I do agree that 17 minutes is a short workout and I would like to try the advanced workout. However, through Amazon, and other retailers, you can only get the instructional, basic and 8 minute workouts. Hopefully soon the advanced workout will be available because the basic isn't enough anymore."
2,Tae Bo is better by another instructor.,"I have seen three of Billy Blanks' tapes. The Instructional video should simply be included on the Basic tape. Billy should also invest in a professional DJ for his staff. The workout class needs to go through the routine more than once before they tape it, Billy needs to speak up and Billy should also think about doing the routine, instead of going around the class.I really like Tae Bo, however it is a lot more productive when working with another instructor."
3,good workout but unsafe moves abound,"I purchased the taebo tapes and have enjoyed them but as a certified aerobics instructor and personal trainer I found some of the moves demonstrated in the video to be unsafe. In the warm-up Billy instructs participants to put their chins to their chest then tip their heads back. This movement is contraindicated!!! Cervical flexion is not advised. Also the participants demonstrate stretching movements that include bouncing this too is contraindicated. Ballistic(bouncing) stretching should NEVER be done. Too much hype for the price, join a club and take a decent kick boxing class and you'll get the same results ,safer."
5,Awesome. Gets your heart going and your adrenaline flowing.,"Taebo, kicks ass. Billy Blanks is incredible, a genius. I'll never use anything else."
4,fun but expensive,Tae bo is a lot of fun now that I'm into it however amazon is not offering the advanced or the eight minute tape and you really only need to watch the instructional once - a little pricy for a 27 minute workout - if you can get the tapes from a friend do it - but otherwise get it because it's fun and energizing and different - a great new change to tradtional aerobics - it's also mentally a great boost for strength and confidence.
1,Very disappointing.,"I bought the first two Tae-Bo tapes after seeing several Tae-Bo infomercials, and I am soooo disappointed! The people on the infomercials make it sound like the best workout ever, and maybe it is for some people, but I didn't like it at all. The movements were awkward, done too fast, and done too many times in my opinion. Not only do they move too fast to begin with, but there are several spots in the second tape where Billy Blanks yells ""Double-Time, go!"" and they move at fast-forward speed. How can that be safe? After doing Tae-Bo, I felt the soreness in my back and knees, NOT in my muscles. Tae-Bo might be great for somebody who is buff like Billy Blanks, but I think I'll stick with aerobics and yoga."
4,An exciting new approach to fitness and excercise!,I had the privilege of being at the Oprah Winfrey show when she was in the Bahamas. We enjoyed watching Billy Blanks show us an exciting new approach to fitness and excercise.I recomend these tapes.Billy starts off with the introduction warm up tape then on to the basic workout tape. Try them and see!
4,great workout,"Great workout but there is one draw back - sometimes gets hard to hear instructions due to music volume. Also, if you order direct from the Tae Bo folks, you get an advanced workout video (4 tapes total). You'll pay more ($60) but the extra video is 57 minutes vs. 27 for the one you receive with this offer. Your choice!!"
3,not bad,"My wife and I took areobics for several years until we became bored with the gym routine. We both have worked out to the viedo and found it to be fairly good. The music is AWFUL and the transitiom from the actual workout to the cool down was too quick. Overall, not bad but it is something different and I hope the next one is better."
4,Some safety concerns,"I have been doing Tae Bo for several months, and I find it to be very effective, and much more fun to do in the morning than a run. However, I would like to pass on some concerns. People should be very careful when doing the neck stretches shown in the beginning. Please bring your head to the neutral position in between side to side or back to front moves. Don't go straight from one side to the other without pausing in the middle- you could cause injury to your neck."
3,I'm sorry to say I'm disappointed,"I tried to stay enthusiastic about doing the basic workout but, frankly, I just got bored! The audio is barely audible, the tape quality is laughable, and the performances are sloppy. I hope to find the advanced tape and give it a try. Basic tape isn't much of a workout. And, like I said, it's BORING! However, I'm sure the Billy Blanks classes are fantastic. They look great. But the tapes are just mediocre."
3,Too much hype...,"Im pretty sure that a lot(but not all) of people here praising this video fit into a single category: Someone who hasnt worked out in a while, sees all the hype, buys the video, then writes a review after less than a week.Working out makes you feel good. And no matter what you choose to do after not working out for a while feels rewarding. Heck...start with walking, its good for you and to top it off, its FREE!Weed through the reviews, you will see a lot of beginners who think they have found gold, and then a few reviews from people who workout regularly, these are the people you should listen too.The workout is good, but its overall package is worse than most tapes out there. Improvement on the teaching, music, and camera angles is greatly needed to ensure that someone will stick with this workout. My recomendation...wait till they revise and release a new version, which they are bound to do with how well this one has sold."
3,"good, but could be better","I bought the 2 tape set. The workout is good, but the longer version, I'm sure, would provide better results. The longer version should also be available for retail purchase as is the 2 tape set. The his left, your right problem is valid. The music could be improved as well. I'll continue to use it and keep looking for the advanced tape in the retail stores."
3,Good for an experienced excerciser.,"Encouragement si good but warm up and cool down is way to fast (movements) and bouncing youjr hamstrings (as you do push-ups) is like one of the most known no-no's, yet Billy ahs you doing it. Also you quickly want to do another tape but the tape that seems to have the most merit isn't included and I havent found whre to buy it. You get an instructional, a workout a d a postcard to send in for a 8 minute tape but there is supposed to be a longer tape that I can't find. Know what you are doing are you could hurt yourself but otherwise it is fine and encouraging. Not anything like the commercials on tv though! Good luck and God bless!!"
4,I loved this video!!!!,I love this video. It made me feel so good. After I was done I felt like I had really worked out and I wasn't exhausted. It was a workout plus it taught me how to defend myself. It is the best workout video that I have ever done. I totally recommend it. You will love it just like I do. I feel great about myself!!!
3,"Good, however....","I have really enjoyed tae-bo so far, and will continue to do so, although as stated in previous comments, the music was poor, the price ridiculous (for 17 minutes), minimal warmup - should be longer to allow your muscles time to prepare.. and these people dripping in sweat? Please... yes you sweat, but really! And, it could have been longer to provide me with more of a sense of getting a really good workout"
5,"Fitness with ""Tae Bo""-it's time has come!","I have always wished there was a workout that you don't have to dance, you don't have to buy fancy and expensive equipment,and you can actually finish the workout and feel GOOD! Tae Bo has made my wishes come true. The instructional tape is invaluable-Billy shows you step-by-step how to perform the moves. The Basic workout warms you up, gets up that heart rate, and helps you practice what I call 'power moves'. A stretch cool down and I'm ready for my day-feeling great. It comes with a mail in card for the 8 minute workout (I can't wait for mine to get here).Billy Blank's Tae Bo work out series promotes a great power workout-and it's about time!"
4,What are you... JEALOUS?,"Yeah, the music is kinda cheesy & there is some potential to hurt oneself. And yes, I agree, it's foolish to think an exercise video is equivalent to a course in self-defense. But some of the reviews you martial arts experts have given trip me out.Fact is, somewhere in the area of 50% of Americans are overweight. Fact is, I'm one of them. Fact is, I've been doing Tae Bo for 3 weeks and I'M SEEING RESULTS. I'm wearing jeans I haven't worn in MONTHS, and seeing toning in my legs I haven't seen in... well, ever.What are you martial arts experts... like 0.02% of the population? I'm sure Billy is crying over the poor reviews his video has received from his martial arts peers... all the way to the bank.Keep it up Billy. Ya done good."
5,Its the greatest,I feel that this video is better than any other that I've seen because its fun and a lot more exciting
4,"Amazing workout, but buy the advanced tape","I bought the tapes, but I watched the intro tape once, did the beginner tape for around a week, and now I'm doing the advanced tape and I love it. But because the first two tapes (the ones offered here) will only keep you interested for maximum one month, borrow the first tapes from a friend (My friends have been borrowing mine), and order the advanced for keeps. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. You shouldn't have to pay for the intro tape, it should have been included with the basic workout."
5,It is for anyone!,I just love tae bo and even though I am a just one person I know tons of other people who are differet ages who do this! You are never to young or old to start it!
5,The best workout tape I have ever used!,"The best thing about Tae Bo is that it is short and to the point! 30 minutes of my time and I feel like I have really worked out! No stomach crunches, no slow instructions that you have to listen to even after you know the moves. I would recommend this to anyone who is already in average physical shape and wants to get fit!"
2,Workout is Incomplete,"I kept hearing rave reviews of this video, so I bought it. I was extremely dissappointed. First of all, it is supposed to be ""Basic"". If that was ""Basic"", then I really would hate to see what is considered ""Advanced"". It wasn't that the moves were too hard, but it was higher intensity than other ""Basic"" tapes I have followed. Secondly, the workout was incomplete. The tape seemed to end abruptly with almost no cool down or and no stretching."
5,If you read no other review read this....,"Unfortunetly I bought Tae-Bo directly from the informercial and waited 4 weeks, so please use Amazon. But, my oh my was the wait ever worth it. I have used free weights, Denise Austin tapes, stairmaster, airwalkers, steppers, but I have never seen such quick, dramatic results with anything else but Tae-Bo. I gained 75 lbs in 5 months when I was pregenant and I never, ever thought my stretched stomach would return to its ""normal"" size because of the fast weight gain. I was wrong, because with the advanced tape, the stomach exercises are so good, so powerful that before I knew it I saw stomach muscles.The boxing/karate stpes combined also make me feel "" cool"" when I work out as opposed to feelingstupied with ballet like steps in most tapes. If you want to work out, and lose weight and look good, dotry everything else, then try this, and you will know you have found the best."
5,"It's fun, it's easy, and it makes u want 2 come back 4 more!","The workout is GREAT! I'd lost inches in no time. Billy really cares about you reaching you fullest potential. He talks to you and you know he really means it. He's the expert and I can't wait for the final results. A friend of mine is doing it twice a day, I'm still working on the basic. :-) If you don't have it, GET IT! It's definately worth the time and $$$."
1,Ruptured a disc during Tae Bo!,"Sure, I was hyped behind the informercials, and I did get started with the beginner's tape. I took to doing everyday, and it was rather tough getting through it because of the music. To me, music just makes or breaks the workout, but honestly I caution everyone that if you have had back injuries, or if you are not well coodinated then please find another workout -- a safer workout. I ruptured a disc in my back over 9 months ago during this Tae Bo advanced workout, and the road to recovery has been long. I don't know that I will ever be the same after this injury. I caution everyone to think twice about this tape. The speeds are much too fast, and the neck movements are really dangerous too -- if you don't rupture a disc, I guarantee you will end up breaking your neck. What was Billy thinking? He had the right approach in mind, but honestly, he shouldn't have made claims that he couldn't follow through with!"
1,Tae-Bo is all Hype,"THIS WORKOUT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! I REPEAT, THIS WORKOUT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! I have trained in kickboxing and sparred. I bought the Tae-Bo tape to compliment my endurance and training. I used it twice. This work-out is extremely bad for the lower back. The speed combined with the number of repititions of some of the kicks are both hazdouse and would NEVER be used in kickboxing,BECAUSE IT COULD CAUSE INJURY. The neck exercises are dangerous and the short warm up and cool down do not stretch the necessary areas to help prevent injury. I cannot urge you enough to disregard all the hype this video has created and find another kickboxing video for your use. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HEALTH OR YOUR MONEY ON ANY OF THESE TAE-BO TAPES."
2,Used 3 times,I forced myself to watch this tape three times so that I could make sure I got the moves down. My ultimate recommendation is try to get it for ultracheap somewhere or rent it or borrow it from the library. You won't use it despite people recommending you got back periodically to review correct form.
5,Buy the tapes!,"I purchased the Instructional/Basic videos retail and after one week, I knew I had to get the Advanced video tape! Fortunately, I was able to obtain the Advanced workout video through TAE-BO's (800) customer service number. I can't wait until it arrives! After four children and years of saying, ""THIS TIME I WILL STICK TO IT!"" - GOD has given me an answer to my weight loss prayers! Thank GOD for Billy Blanks!"
3,Needs better music but the workout is fantastic.,"The quality and selection of the music leaves something to be desired but the workout is wonderful and Billy is very interesting. Sherry is obviously a TAE-BO guru and the result is seen in her stomach muscles. I enjoy the sense of empowerment from learning how some defense techniques. I hope that he does another video and makes it available for a decent price in Canada. It is still cheaper and cleaner than going to a gym and my husband and I do it together. Thanks Billy - Cynthia, Alberta Canada."
3,This video is not as hard as the infomercial makes it out to,"In working out to Tae-Bo, I discovered I am in better shape then I thought. After a thirty pound weight loss, I was looking for a new challenge, I was walking and doing the Total Gym-1000. Tae-Bo is challenging and you need to be coordinated to do the moves, it is fun. Try working out with a friend-you may laugh at each other, but unless you are serious about working out you may give up after a few tries, you and your friend can keep each other on task."
3,stimulating,"I bought the instuctional video and the basic workout last week at blockbuster. I have been doing aerobic tapes for several years and most of my tapes are over 30 minutes long. I feel to benefit from any work out you have to have your heart rate up for at least 20 to 30 minutes. I think tae bo is a great work out,, i think you have to keep going in order to truly experience a weight loss. Although at the high impact of a work out,, you would tire out to quickly and want to stop. So, we will see,, i enjoy it,, but, feel the work out should be a bit longer than 17 min. And plus the price is really outrageous!!!"
4,I wish the workout video was as long as the instructional vi,"I loved the workout, but it could have been a little bit longer. The tape left me feeling as though I hadn't working out long enough."
4,Be careful,"As a physical therapist, I would like to let everyone know to be careful with Tae Bo. I love working out to them but be careful how high you kick and on double time. some of the moves are dangerous in double time. I just keep with single time and count on my own. Be aware of your form (knees can't pass toes when squat)."
3,"it makes you sweat, but it's overpriced and hard to follow","to be sure I'm going to use it and hopefully get results. it was fun enough. However, it's extremely hard to follow because he talks to you as if you are behind him instead of in front such that if you follow his instructions, you end up facing *away* from the tv -- it took a while to figure it out and I ended up just ignoring him and mirroring his moves. As it is, i would have been happier if my 35.00 was spent on the beginning and advanced workout, not the beginning and the intro -- little pricey for just those two. Of course, they *are* selling like hotcakes..."
4,The best motivator I've had.,"Tae Bo is a wonderful exercise program. Not only do you get your cardio workout, but you also get strength training. I've been doing Tae Bo for nearly two months and I love how I feel! I'm not bored with it and I look forward to doing it every day. It is difficult, and I've even wanted to quit sometimes, but I promised myself I'd stick with it. Now that I have, it's become a habit to Tae Bo six days a week.Some people are complaining about the poor tape quality and the music. If these are obstacles to their working out, I don't think they are very committed to getting in shape. Exercise is what you make of it.Pick up these tapes. You will be so glad you did."
4,Great but there is one drawback,"I saw the videos when I was in the USA during the second week of april. Normally I am not the type of person who would buy such videos but this one had me convinced. The drawback is that living in The Netherlands, we use another television system and I cannot play the tapes. I came looking to Amazon to provide me with the videos for the our system but unfortunately. Hopefully I will come out soon cuz I want to do my Tae Bo with Billy."
5,"Great workout for the mind, body & spirit!","After training in the Korean martial art of Tae Kwon Do for almost a year and a half and obtaining my blue belt, I was deeply disappointed to find that my schedule would no longer permit me to continue with my training. I have recently started using Tae Bo during my lunch hour at work. It is just like being back in the doh jang with my Sah Bum Nim! Thanks Billy for reconnecting me with my martial arts background and helping to motivate me towards achieving my fitness goals, physical, emotional & mental."
5,be sure to get the advanced tape!,"The tapes are pretty good, but you will move past the basic one quickly if you are in fairly good shape. The advanced tape is the real workout and Billy really shows his personality. I have been doing it 2 months now and I still enjoy it. Thanks Billy!"
4,A little too short,"The instructional portion was very helpful. However, the actually workout in the basic video is only 27 minutes long, which I found very disappointing. I had just started to get winded, and it was done! These two videos should have been condensed into one. Other than that, it was worth it. I work out daily, and this still made me a little stiff the next day."
4,"Tae-Bo, Fun but kind of hard","I do Tae-Bo and I think it is awesome! It makes me sweat and feel like I'm doing something really beneficial for my body. I must admit, though that I've had it for a while and I have a hard time not stopping to get a break. When it gets faster I get slower."
4,good workout but needs to be longer,I've seen the instructional and the first workout tape and find them to be good a beginner workout. I hope Billy adds more tapes to his library that will give us beginners more variety.
5,"Great video, fun and worth it.","I want to comment on the music problem; Once you have the routine down pat, just turn off it's sound and put on your own favorite music. Easy!"
5,THE BEST WORKOUT ON EARTH! WHY DIDN'T IT COME OUT SOONER?,I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK BILLY BLANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING UP WITH TAE BO. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ALL THE TAPES AND RIGHT NOW I'M TRYING TO ADVANCE FROM THE BASIC WORKOUT TO THE 8 MIN ONE. I HAVE SEEN RESULTS BECAUSE MY THIGHS ARE FIRMER AND SMALLER. MY LEGS LOOK GORGEOUS! I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING OUT NOW EVERYDAY UNLIKE WHEN I USE TO WORKOUT WITH TONY LITTLE OR RICHARD SIMMONS. THANK YOU BILLY! AMERICA LOVES YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU'RE DOING FOR US! PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THAT THEY NEED TO GET IN SHAPE BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD AND NOW BILLY'S TAPES ARE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. THANKS AGAIN BILLY!!
1,Faulty Tape,"Upon receiving the Tae Bo Basic and Instructional tapes, I proceeded to play them. Neither one worked. They both were faulty. They got caught up in my vcr player and had to be thrown out. So much for trusting Amazon!"
4,Great Workout ... A lot of fun to do!,"This is a great workout ... it's a lot of fun, but it is hard! I've worked out for over 4 years at gyms, other videos, etc. This video has great moves for your whole body! Billy Banks is not very motivational though! He needs help in exercise instruction .. but the moves and workout itself are fun and do the job!"
2,"Good workout, but the tapes are expensive and poor quality.","I bought into the hype and purchased the TAEBO tapes. They are disappointing. The music is awful, Billy is almost impossible to hear, and the set is LOW budget. The TAEBO workout is fun, but there is very little variety in the moves provided on the Basic tape, which quickly becomes routine. As someone has already mentioned in the reviews, the instructional tape is a waste, in that you will watch it once, maybe twice, and never again. I am hoping that when the ""bonus"" 8 minute workout arrives, it will be an improvement. From the infomercials it looks like Billy has a fun and challenging class but it does not translate to these videos. I wish he would have just taped one of those classes and saved all of us a couple of bucks off this overpriced set."
1,A waste of Time!,"Billy Blanks is a total freak! He says that this is a breakthrough in fitness and losing weight. It is more like a breakthrough in learning how to be bored. The music is awful-- garbage, if I must. He says that you'll feel better and stronger. The truth is, he starts sweating by just stretching his neck! The camera work is terrible. The moves are unclear. If you want to lose weight, scientific proof shows that by just smelling a green apple or banana works. I say it works a lot better than Tae Bo."
2,"For those with no martial arts experience, it's good.","Maybe it's because I took martial arts in the past, but I was greatly dissapointed with the Tae Bo tapes I tried with friends. If you've taken martial arts before and you know how to execute the basic necessities, then the presentation of these punches, kicks, etc. leaves a lot to be desired. The basic video is an okay workout, but expects a lot of a person by way of standing kicks and doesn't have as much full body workout as I wanted. There were also one or two moves that were used in the basic video that weren't presented in the instructional video, either."
2,not as easy as they say,"I got the video and I will tell you, it takes some days to get use to the steps, I am thinking about shipping it back. First of all, I think it's because I am not really coordinated and it takes me a while to catch on. I feel like these are dance steps. Also you have to be very careful with this video, because you can really hurt yourself if you don't watch out, esp. your knee or foot. I think's its a bit too much for a novice. On tv it looks good and the steps flow so easy but for me this just wasn't the case."
1,I am still fat,I have been doing this video for a week now and I am still fat. This is not the miracle everyone is making it out to be. I guess I am just going to have to be happy with the body God gave me and stop complaining.
2,Could be better,"I liked the tape for the first few days, but this low budget overpriced film left me wishing I'd put the 40 bucks towards a membership at the gym."
1,"Ow, My Knee, My Knee!!!","Billy Blanks probably has set two records in his life (three, if you count the number of lies he told in his infomercial, as exposed by some newspaper journalists recently). First, he has been on TV more times than Michael Jordan. And two, he caused me to give up on an exercise program faster than anybody in history. The stretches he did are painful for somebody who is not in good shape already (and I carry 315 pounds on my 5'5"" frame) and the workout itself is not meant for people not in shape (way too fast). My knees were killing me after about 5 minutes. If you are in shape, Tae-Bo is probably a good way to stay that way. But if you're one milkshake away from a coronary, you're probably best starting out on some kind of walking/jogging program to get that first load of weight off of you before going with Tae-Bo."
2,Not for beginners,I started exercising for the first time 15 mths after my first baby. This is not for beginners! I could hear my joints screaming in pain with every kick or punch. Eventually I stopped all together. I didn't think he did great at motivation either...he came off as cocky to me.
2,Not that great,"I'm a second degree black belt in Taekwon-Do and I decided to try out Tae Bo and I didn't think it's that great. It's just like any other aerobics workout, but you need to know some basic skills that aren't really covered to get maximum efficeincy out of it. Also, it leads people into a false sense of security that they know how to defend themselves adequately when all they know is a few kicks. Tae Bo is just another fad, and if you want a real workout and learn how to truely defend yourself, try the more traditional martial arts like Taekwon-Do, Kung-Fu, Aikido, or whatever else is available."
2,Decided not to buy the video!,"Thanks to all the REAL work-out pros, I have decided NOT to buy the Tae*Bo tapes. Seems the video is poorly made with bad audio, cheesy music, the workout is too short with not enough warm up/down, and Billy doesn't even do the work out himself, which is what I would want to see, or at least more full body shots of the movements, not of sweaty faces. So I thank all of you who were honest in your reviews. I will stick to my current FREE routine of weight training, push-ups and my BRISK daily 3 mile walk! I am happy to save the money and will spend it on a new work-out outfit instead!"
2,Not What I expected!,I see that there is potential for this work out. I'm in good shape and was looking for another type of work out. I just get warmed up and the tape ends. I don't think it lives up to its billing. If you're just getting started this may be a good start. Otherwise don't spend your money.
2,Doesn't meet expectations,"I watched his infomercial, I read the reviews on this page, I checked out Mr Blanks' tae-bo web page and I bought the tapes. I'm not pleased with the product. Another reviewer mentioned the ""his left/your right"" error. This can be very frustrating initially. I imagine the actual class with Mr Blanks is great, but the tapes are over-priced and over-hyped."
5,It is a great way to enhance your current workout program.,"Tao-Bo is a great way to enhance your current workout program. It helps you work all of the major muscle groups. If you like feeling the ""burn"" this is for you. I like the fact that he continually reminds you to hold in your stomach throughout the entire workout. The Basic tape is only 27 minutes with the actual workout at 18 minutes. There is an advanced tape for those who are really to progress to a more intense and longer workout. The only downfall of the video series is the music it's not very inspiring, but workout makes up for poor choice of music. I am looking forward to the continued toning and slimming of my hips and thighs."
5,THE workout for agressive people,"I LOVE Tae-Bo!! I get bored with or feel silly doing traditional aerobics tapes, but not with Tae-Bo. On top of that, this is THE workout for aggressive people. I REALLY get into the quick, strong punches and kicks. It's a great way to work off the frustrations of the day. This video series is a great way to relieve stress and workout at the same time. One note concerning the difference between the package from Amazon and the one from the infomercial. This one has the Instructional and Basic videos (plus a coupon for the 8-minute video, I think), while the package from the infomercial ALSO includes a 1-hour Advanced video and the 8-minute workout (no mail-in coupon necessary). Just be aware of the difference, and get what suits you best."
1,Wasn't shipped what I paid for,I purchased the Tae-Bo workout Instructional and Basic VHS tapes and only received one tape in the mail.
2,Not advanced enough if you're already in shape.,"I have had the tapes for a few months now. It is quite fun to do, but for someone who has been working out for years, even the advanced tape is not difficult enough. For beginners, the tape may be harmful if the moves are not performed properly. The tapes are far too short, also. Basically, I have given up on the tapes."
2,"The Basic Vid is too basic, more punching upper body needed","I am disapointed in this video, I thought I could really get a good sweat. I cant even hear his instrucitons on the video, the tapes are poor quality and he doesnt explain all the moves properly. Try something else."
2,"Good, but very short","I recently started using the Tae-Bo tapes, but I am disappointed with the tapes. The instructional video is used ONCE, unless you forget how to do a move and refer to it; however, you won't forget a move if you use the work-out tape daily. The work-out tape is long enough to make you break a sweat and then it's time to cool down. You have to do the work-out tape TWICE if you want to see results. The work-out, as short as it may be, is a good one. However, it is worth it to go and buy a non-Billy Blanks Tae-Bo tape to get a longer work-out that is worth your money."
2,Very basic,"After all the hype I heard about this video, I was extremely dissapointed. The actual workout video is only 30 minutes and very basic. I expected more for the amount of money I paid."
2,"Good workout, but way too short!","Tae Bo is not what I was expecting. The workout is good, but a little repetitive. The biggest downfall though, is it's total length, including warm up and cool down, is 25 minutes. Actual time for the aerobic workout is 17 minutes. Just when my heart is pumping and I'm sweating, it's over! I find that the Richard Simmons ""Sweating to the Oldies 3"" gives a better sustained workout. However, if it's one of those days when I don't have an hour to spare, it at least gets me moving! I suggest renting it first, to see if it's for you!"
2,Please be careful,"I have trained in Martial Arts for 7+ years but have been out of training for about 5. I thought this would be a fun workout with a martial arts touch and it is. But if you have never had any training, please be careful. I spent years perfecting the kicks that TaeBo teaches in 30 seconds. I know how to move my feet to protect my knees. I also know that when the tape tells you to move in double-time, there is no way to have good form and move that fast - you could hurt yourself. I just keep moving the original speed. This goes for the punches and the kicks. If you have not previously trained in martial arts, go slow, listen to your body, and be careful. If your schedule permits, look for a good, traditional martial arts school - talk about a workout! Good luck."
4,The video was fun and full of excitement.,"I used Tae-Bo for the first time this week. My whole office is doing Tae-Bo. Although I expected more up beat music, the excerises are good. This is a good work out to use in between your normal excerise routine."
5,"I love this workout, it's easy, fun, and motivational","These are great videos, it's so much fun my two year old daughter tries to do some of the punches and kicks. That, to me, is the sign of a great video. If you can get a child to move along with what's going on on the screen, I am impressed. It does really work, I have been doing the Taebo for two weeks, and already see improvements in my breathing and strength. THANKS TAEBO."
3,"I really like doing this video, but......","there could be some changes. I thought it was just me wondering WHY he has you doing the old-type stretches that everyone else tells you not to do! I also think the warm up and cool down are much too short. Like everyone else, I'm interested in finding the advanced tape, but could only locate it in a four-box set. However, it's a nice change from my regular routine, and I can do it in my livingroom!"
5,the workout with pizazz!!,this video has been a great inspiration to me and to all of the people I work with. That's all we do all day long is practice our sidekicks and jabs. And yes we always keep our stomachs pulled in! Thanks Billy for making workouts fun again!! My daughter even does the workout with me because she enjoys the movements and they are easy for her to do. I highly recommend this tape to anyone who wants to get into shape.
3,Fun workout to mix-up your regular routine,"This is a fun workout to add to your regular routine, but I haven't found it as challenging as either the box aerobix or step classes taught at my gym. I've found a better workout for boxing (with better instruction) is the Kathy Smith Aerobox tape. However, the Tae-Bo tape is a pretty good leg workout. Mix it once or twice a week with running, weight training and other aerobic workouts and it'll do the job. I wouldn't rely on it as your sole workout to get in shape."
2,Just too difficult - unless you're a pro kickboxer,I was really excited about buying this tape and did it as soon as I got home! I am in pretty good shape and have to say that this tape is way too hard for the average person. The people are kicking way too high (we ARE supposed to follow them) and the rhythm is so fast that it's easy to pull a muscle or lose your balance. I suppose I burned calories because my heart felt like it was beating out of my chest. I think it's a pretty dangerous tape that gives far-too-little instruction for a far-too-advanced activity.
5,No wonder that Tae Bo is a big hit!,"Billy Blanks really has created a great workout that is fun and effective. It can be done even in a hotel room or a small apartment, and it takes no equipment other that a VCR or DVD player.This tape can be done by nearly anyone, with the warning that the high side kicks can hurt a bad back. So naturally, if you have any physical limitations, you should check your doctor or physical therapist. However, in the instruction tape, Billy Blanks tells you a number of times that it is more than OK to do just what you are able to do.Even if you skip the dramatic, Tiger-and-Dragon style high kicks, and just punch and move your feet in time to the tape, you will be sweating and having a great workout. This is truly exercise for nearly anyone. No wonder it's a hit. This is fun and effective, and Mr. Blanks is a warm, encouraging, inspiring presence."
5,Great Workout!,"I started doing the basic Tae-Bo last March and since then have lost 56 lbs. and I have much more energy and basically just feel good. I think the money I spent on his tapes were well worth every cent. I have just started doing to advanced this week and I love it! I only have sore muscles and Tae-Bo is so much more fun than other workouts! If you do the exercises correctly, you shouldn't have a sore back!"
3,"Good Exercise, but","I have went through both the instructional and basic tape, but for the cost of both of them, I would expect the basic could of had an entire workout. I realize you can buy the advanced if you want a longer worker, but couldn't they just did it first and let people work up to it! I think the work out is good, but you do need to be careful not to injure yourself when doing it, don't try to kick as high as the people in the video nor go as fast! I would probably recommend the advanced, but I am not so sure I want to spend the money on another tape."
5,I love tae bo,"it so energizing and it makes me want to exercise every single day. I'll never get bored with tae bo, its fabulous."
4,Where's the rest?,"I liked it a lot, however, how does one get hold of the advanced tape. The 27 minute tape is too short to get a decent workout."
3,needs enhancement,"tae bo is a fun way to help get you to your next level of fitness BUT... do your own thorough stretching, not much emphasis on stretching properly and safely here..... Don't take this to be self defence!! self defence has been a selling point for tae bo, if your in trouble and you rely on tae bo to get you out with out other defence skills, the most you'll do is get a crunch in before your attacked (on a good note i think tae bo is a good pre karate program you do get balance and muscle memory from these tapes) I like tae bo but it's not the holy grail. have fun"
3,"Great Excersize, But why the horrible quality tape?","While Tae-bo is taking the fitness world ""by storm"", I say that there are many video's that are on this level. Tae-bo does offer a great workout, however the tape quality itself is so bad. Chessy music that does not get the viewer ""hyped"", poor instruction, poor sound quality, etc. does not warrant rave reviews from this Tae-bo-er. While I loved the workout, I think 30 dollars is too much for these tapes. I would recommend Disco Sweat if Tae-bo was too much for you. Richard Simmons, however wacky, got me sweating with this tape."
2,Not Safe for the Average person,"This workout is too fast paced for the average person. There is not an adequate warm up or cool down. He doesn't show any alternative moves for people who are just beginning to work out. The neck stretch could potentially injure someone. The neck should not go back and forth to the extent and at the speed that he does it. Several of the other moves are simply not safe, putting alot of stress on the joints. If you choose to use this workout, go SLOW, listen to your body and adapt any moves that are difficult to do to lower impact moves and keep your body in a good posture."
3,"Needs warmup,good sweat,energenic,sometimes hard to follow.","I enjoy Tae Bo, it gives me energy. I feel a litte stronger and tighter but not losing any weight. I exercise everyday, with some tape. Billy's has lots of energy to get you going in the morning. I like doing different porgrams so I do not get bored.I like the talking$the coaching to continue. I need that. Needs more floor work too."
4,Tae Bo = Results!,"Despite Billy Blanks' shortcomings as an exercise instructor, this is the best video workout tape I've found as far as producing results. After losing 20 lbs. through a protein diet, I knew I had to do something to keep the weight off. Tae Bo was it! I am now approaching my seventh month of doing Tae Bo an average of 3-4 times a week, and, at 36, I look better than I ever have before. My only disappointment in the workout is how abruptly Billy takes you from a high-intensity exercise immediately into the cool-down. I have to keep marching while doing the cool-down just so my lungs don't explode! On future tapes, Billy could improve his workout by using a more gradual cool-down."
4,I'm sticking with Billy!,"As stated in other reviews, the music and quality of the videos can be a little cheesy, BUT, overall I have really enjoyed Tae Bo Instructional, Basic and the 8 min. workout. I also get a kick out of watching the ""buff"" entourage misstep. This actually keeps me motivated because it shows that even those people are making the same missteps as me. Billy Blanks and the Tae Bo videos have changed my attitude about exercising. I am addicted! The routines are very engaging and fun. I never thought I would be able to keep up and was excited the first time I got through the Basic tape workout without missing a beat. Way to go Billy! It would help if he took a little more time to warm up. I have tried stretching a little more before my workout."
4,It works and great results,Tae-Boa gets me hyped and tightens my every body part -- It works only if you have the initiative to follow the instructions and do a great job throughout the workout - I recommend TB to anyone
5,"FUN, FUN AND MORE FUN","NOT MUCH OF AN EXCERSICE BUFF, BUT NEED TO LOOSE WEIGHT. I HATE DIETING AND SO I PICKED UP THE TAE BO TAPES. I LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!!!! NOW I LOVE TO EXCERSICE. MY SISTER AND I GET TOGETHER ATLEAST 2 TIMES A WEEK TO DO THE TAPES AND I ALSO WORK AT AN AMBULANCE SERVICE WHERE WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE TAPES INTO OUR TRAINING (FITNESS TRAINING) THANKS FOR MAKING THE TAPES SO FUN!!!!"
5,Tae-Bo is an excellent beginning workout.,"I tried Tae-Bo for the first time today. I bought the full four video set and I must admit, the workout was great. I felt powerful and motivated for once in my life. The instructional and basic video are easy to follow and provide a workout that will really make you sweat! I would recommend Tae-Bo to anyone who wants to get in shape. It's easy and fun. Billy Blanks is truly motivational. When I felt like quitting, he offered words of encouragement that would make me want to do more."
5,Absolutely Awesome,"My husband bought the set of tapes from an infomercial whle he was traveling and I thought ""here we go again"". I was very suprised to see how great a set he had gotten. I have been trying to lose weight for the last ten years and have experienced the yo-yo up and down. These tapes mean a lot me us. They are inspirational, hard and easy both and best of all you see results quickly (with consistency). My husband and I both enjoy it daily and we even have our three children 17, 13, 10 joining in and we have Sunday Family Taebo. Thanks Again."
3,Fun but not enough.,"I was expecting a highly energetic work-out that left me breathless and sweaty. Right when I feel like we should really get moving, the cool down begins. It's really too bad that you can't purchase the advanced tape by itself. The side kicks are fun though and I recommend this for someone just starting to work out. I get a better workout running on my treadmill and lifting."
3,"its great at first, but......","I bought this video and I was kinda hesitant about it because I didnt know if I would be able to keep up with it, but I did, in fact I thought it was great to do, it really left me feeling good about my body. The thing about the tae bo videos is that 1. they are to short, a good work out should be atleast 45-60 minutes long with a good warm up and cool down, something this video lacked. 2. The camera work was terrible, there were a lot of moves that I needed a full body view of in order to know that I am doing them right and the camera was mainly focusing on the peoples faces. I thought it was a great video but I think they should have put a little more work into the production of the video."
5,You will love it.,"What's the old saying....You have nothing to lose and a lot to gain....Well, Billy proves that old theory false. If you are doing this tape you have a lot to lose. Weight wise that is. This is the first fitness program that I have ever stuck to. I have always been very athletic, softball, dancing, volleyball, etc. Tae-Bo does it all....It really holds your interest and you can feel results after the first workout. It's great for all ages, shapes and sizes. If you are not getting the results, then you are doing something wrong. You can't go wrong with this program! Buy it, it's worth it!"
3,Basic or not,I bought the instructional and Basic videos. The instructional was good and I did learn a few moves but the basic was or I should say doesn't look anything like suppose to. There are some moves that were never in the instructional and why did Billy Blanks say that he hoped I had aready gone through the basic video when I was waiting for the basic workout. The video my say basic but could actually be advanced? Anybody out there know for sure if the basic video is what says it is?
1,Tae Bo is a sham,Whoever made this video should be ashamed of themself. This video is absolutely no use whatsoever and could not possibly be of any benefit to anyone. I have used the video as a guide to training for many months now and I have actually gained quite a lot of weight and as a result I have lower self esteem than I have ever had in my life. I cannot imagine why anyone would want to try this program. It is terrible...an absolute disgrace.
1,Oh so cheesy,"Dissapointing. Not a very good workout, and I just could not get pass how cheesy the whole thing was. The stage looked like it was slapped together real quick with bad lighting, women with lots of make up and bad workout gear, and Mr. Billy Blanks topped it all off with very 80s leotard/legwarmers that made it hard not to cringe. His interaction with the camera and with the women on stage, compounded with the bad music, was horrible. If it was a really good workout, maybe I could just ignore all these wierd elements, but it wasn't agood workout. Not at all. And I've had m share of kick boxing. Oh well. No more Billy Blanks."
2,used more than once,when reviewing the site it appeared the tapes had only been used once so I was expecting them to be in pretty good shape...they were obviously bought at a garage sale for 2.99 and sold to me at a much higher price. Also the basic workout tape had a broken piece inside which made it very difficult to play.
1,It sux. I didn't even lose my gut. Neither did my friends.,"I've tried every aerobics video out on the market, and this one is probably the WORST and biggest waste of money I have ever wasted. I think if they incorperated some weight training instead of punching and kicking the air (witch just left me with joint problems). Since I started lifting weights however....I lost A LOT more wieght and I'm in the best shape of my life."
4,Advanced tape-excellent workout,"Taebo is a great change of pace, I am ready for a second advanced tape...I am getting bored and live in New York so I can not afford to fly to Billy's actual class!!!! I sure wish I could, because he is nice to look at..."
1,Great disappointment!,"I had such great expectations for this video, and after having paid $59.99 for it from the infomercial, I really wanted to get some good use out of it. What a great big disappointment! First of all, he is very uncoordinated and it's very difficult to keep up with him and all throughout the workout he tells you to exercise on the right side when he means left side and so forth. It is fine for the first couple of times, but after a while it gets to be very annoying, and if you're not paying attention you could get confused. This makes the moves quite difficult to follow. And half of the time I couldn't even understand what he was saying. My advice is, save your money, there are far better workout videos out there on kick boxing."
2,too much fuss for nothing,"hi! i bought this video 7 months ago and have barely seen results,i have a very controlled diet and other videos seem more effective this gets ur heart rate up but no frimness,its too overpriced but nothing special,dont waste your money"
2,hype?,"I bought the instructional/basic tapes and found Billy Blanks to be completely UN-inspirational and very UN-charismatic. Two traits which, if I'm not mistaken, are useful in a motivational/fitness coach. (?) I found the mix of his uninspired posturing and goading into performing unsafe martial arts moves very disappointing, and not worth the money I shelled out."
4,Tae bo,"I received the order in a timely manner. One thing, the title of the product suggested 2 tapes. I received one. In the future, it is less confusing if the number of taples is specified."
3,Tae-Bo Basic Likes and Dislikes,it would have been better if the tape was on DVD instead of VHS and i don't understand why these particular excersize tapes wasn't converted to DVD.
3,good workout,the basic tape goes dark and sometimes freeze up. I will keep it because I can use the workouts to firm up my arms and so far that part of the tape works.
3,broken vhs case,"The Tae-Bo workout itself is great but the problem was that the 2nd vhs case was broken so I do not get to advance to the ultimate workout. It was in plastic, so I suppose it was held onto for too long. Returning it seemed like more trouble than it was worth. Just dont take for granted even new items still in package can be broken."
4,Excellent to raise the heart rate and burn fat,"The Taebo basics and the 8 minute workout have been like a little piece of heaven for me. I had a child 15 months ago and still hadn't lost the weight (1) because I got REALLY lazy and (2) because I was no longer motivated by the exercise tapes I had on my video shelf. After a year of having to lay down to put on my jeans, using the excuse that I just had a child didn't wash. I had to face the fact that I was just plain fat. I highly recommend the Taebo tapes for new, and not so new moms. The instructional video is a MUST to prevent hurting yourself. After a Taebo workout I feel energized and exhausted at the same time if that makes any sense. I would however advise that you use some of the techniques you learned in other workout tapes to cool down. Billy Blanks doesn't do a long or gradual enough cool down to lower your heart rate before the tape is over. Other than that I think it would be a good buy."
4,Taebo gives the results that Billy Blanks promised!,"After working out for two years, I hit a plateau... I decided to try the tapes, what could it hurt. After six weeks I lost two inches off my waist, and my arms and legs are now very firm. I'm up to the advanced tape which I ordered from the Taebo website. This workout is challenging and lots of fun. I recommend it to anyone who needs a boast to their routine. The music on the video won't win any grammy awards, and the production quality isn't the best in the world, but you will see great results."
4,Tae Bo For Beginners,"I'm 13 yrs. old and I did the Tae Bo instructional video today, and it was grrrreat!!! I can't wait to do the other videos!!!!"
4,Great but..the 'Advance tape' is needed for the fit person,"These two tapes (Basic and Instructional) are not for someone looking for a hard workout. Billy Banks offers the ADVANCE tape which is great. This tape presents a solid workout for someone in good cardiovascular condition. The Advanced tape still has a lot of stops inbetween sets/moves but one can always continue another set while waiting for the next exercise. Its a great overall workout and you see a change in your body with tight, strong movements. There music selection can be better."
5,GREAT!! Love TAE BO!!,"How many tapes do people buy saying, this is it? Tae Bo is definitly not like that, it stays in the VCR and is continuely played!! I bought it just 3 days ago and already I am hooked. I can not go a day without my Tae Bo! I must do it 2 times a day. Its a little difficult in the beggining but the instructional video is very helpful. I just Love it!!!"
3,A decent work-out with some flaws,"I like the Tae-bo tapes overall, but I still keep my mind unbiased from all the hype. The tape production desires to be better. Music used during the work-outs is quite apalling (should I say garbage). I hope that Bill can implement some improvements in his new tapes."
4,Awesome workout but a little tough.,"I just received this workout video yesterday and I had no energy, but I deceided I would check it out. It was a little tougher than I thought. I think that the workout should concentrate on how to balance properly first. It will be a great workout for me once I get my balance down. I just worked out to the instructional video and I am looking forward to using all 4 tapes."
5,Tae-bo really does work!,Tae-bo really does work. i'll admit i did have a little dought of it at first but it's true you do get results the first time you use it!
5,"This form of exercise is new, fresh and fun!",I really enjoy working out with this video. The tae kwan do type moves are very invigorating. I really want more videos with Billy Blanks and Tae Bo. I would recommend this one to anybody.
5,Invitational Exercise!,Billy Blanks has found the key to invitational excercise. Tae Bo is a workout that you will look forward to doing - and the results are amazing!
4,Get Ready to feel the BURN!,"I am a very out of shape young woman and I have just started using Billy Blank's Tai-Bo video. I enjoyed the easy to use instructional video and felt very comfortable going into the basic video quickly. The Basic work out follows the instructional video closely so you don't feel lost. It gets your heart pumping quickly. Billy also uses a great Tai-Chi type cool down which really ends the work out nicely. The background music really stinks...so after you know the moves turn that down and turn something better up. I also have a hard time looking at the hard bodies on the video with little representation of the USA's standard size 12 woman. I would like to see in this video how an out of shape person deals with the moves. I applaud Billy, really, for making this seem easy and goal orientated. He is fun to watch and very clear in his explanations. You'll like it and you'll have good success! Billy gurantees it!"
2,Save your money,"Tae'bo was really cool the first day. Now a month later it is sitting on my video shelf collecting dust. There are no quick fixes. If you hate exercise this will NOT cure you. It is still exercise. For those looking for a new routine it's fine, but it eventually turns into its very own routine. Be wary of the hype. Try before you buy!"
3,Billy Screws Up the Hook Sequence at the Beginning,"First of all, the post from the disgrunted tae boist from Adelaide a few posts down is hilarious.Following closely behind is the post from another disgrunted tae boist from Jersey City who complains that Billy doesn't know his left from his right. Perhaps you're getting confused because, oh, he's facing your direction. Therefore, when he says ""right"" and throws a jab, it will appear on the, um, left side of your tv screen. Hmmm. In any event, Jersey City, it doesn't really matter if you stick to the left and right instructions since the reps are repeated on both sides. Just be consistent.Anyhow, anyone that says the workout is fun is clearly masochistic. It hurts."
2,I'm not a fan of this video,"Although I have a large video workout library that's in regular use, I had never done kickboxing before and was curious to try it. I did the instructional video first, then the basic video. During the basic workout, Billy tells us not to attempt to kick too high if we can't do it, but I'm in decent shape and I *could* do it (not incredibly high, but about waist high). I even kept up with all of the ""double time"" segments and was moving right along with the umpteenth set of roundhouse kicks until I heard a loud *POP* coming from my right upper leg/glute area, followed by pain and swelling of the joint in that region. I'm healing quickly, but I will not be doing anymore Tae-Bo (luckily, it was just a rental). Instead, I purchased Kathy Smith's kickboxing video which, in my opinion, is a far superior (and MUCH safer) intro to the kickboxing workout. I gave the Tae-Bo video two stars only because of the good-sore feeling I had in my upper back muscles the next day."
1,Don't WasteYour Money!!!,"I have an extensive home library of workout videos..I bought this because of all the ""hype""...I hated the workout and i use the term 'workout' very loosely...billy blanks - motivational - not quite!! I could barely understand him, never mind get motivated by him. Skip these videos and try a ""Firm"" tape instead, then you'll see real results without the risk of throwing out your back!!!"
1,Worst aerobic workout Ive ever experienced,"I can honestly say that Tae Bo is the worst aerobic workout Ive ever had. I am used to doing high intensity step-aerobics and to move on to Tae Bo was to put it bluntly, a dissapointment. If you are even remotely at the advanced level, this tape, which is only 27 minutes long, will hardly put sweat on your brow. My recomendation, save your money on this rip-off and write off Billy Blanks and his poor instruction, terrible set, too low audio, and shiny spandex jump-suit."
5,Extremely fast paced and vigorous,"I have worked in the fitness industry for 20 years and have tried most of the tapes available out there. This tape is challenging and intense. I do not believe this tape is for everyone though. The workout does lack in the stretching department and the quick moves could be bad for some people. Billy B believes in ""feel the burn"" which to many, is too much. If you are young., in shape and without injuries, this tape would be great. I do find it enjoyable and upbeat. I will not limit myself to Tae-Bo., however it is part of my fitness routine. This mixed with machines., classes., and yoga...gives me the all around best workouts. I hope there is more Tae-Bo videos out soon...!!! Enjoy...."
2,"If you are an avid exerciser, don't bother",I've been exercising at home for over 10 years and was excited to add another tape to my collection. (I am a FIRM believer). The tapes were poorly choreographed and the music was lousy. The camera person focused way too much on Billy yammering about making it through the workout rather than focusing on the class. The warm-up was minimal yet all of the students were dripping in sweat.
2,There needs to be more.,"I attend a kick boxing class at my college gym so I bought the tapes to keep up with it over spring break. While the tape is very helpful at explaining techniques, it does not provide a workout that will make you sweat enough. The tape is very short, the music is terrible, and the pace needs to be picked up. For forty dollars, I expected more."
2,"Not worth the $$$, good beginner workout","I am a faithful ""Firm"" believer. I guess I must be in better shape than I thought because I found this workout to be too easy and too short. I agree with other commentators that there's not much for the money here. Try a Firm workout if you want to get in terrific shape. They are great for folks who have a hard time moving their arms and legs at the same time (like me)."
5,Great workout!,"Wonderful tape - Billy Blanks is very motivational. Have only been at it a week now, and already feeling stronger!"
5,You'll see results quickly! Really!,"I know the music is a little cheesy, but I hardly notice it because I'm too busy concentrating on perfecting my punches and kicks! I also usually do some extra warmups prior to beginning the tape, but I have to say that my waist and thighs are smaller after having used the tapes 3 times a week for about a month. It's a great way to supplement your other workouts."
4,A very intense video tape!,"I devoted 3 days a week for 3 months to doing this tape and I can honestly say I am more toned all over, my upper body and lower body strength is greater and Billy Blanks generates so much excitement throughout the tape that I never get bored with it."
5,Totally awesome workout!,"I kept seeing the infomercial for Tae Bo and I thought it looked really cool. Finally after being fed up with my inability to stick with a workout I decided to order the videos and I must say that doing so was the best decision I have ever made! Today was only my third day, but I notice a difference in myself already. I have more motivation than ever and doing these videos has done wonders for my frame of mind. I am even starting to notice a difference physically! Thank you so much Billy, God bless you and all the other Tae Bo users."
5,Hail Billy Blanks!,"This is the best workout I've gotten in a long time. I don't get this motivated or sweat this hard when I go to the gym ever. Tae Bo works my problem areas like no machine in the gym does. My abs, butt, legs, and back are more and more strong every time I put the tapes in. Thanks Billy for making these tapes and pushing me through the toughest parts of them! I'll never look at exercise as a chore again!"
5,"Great, motivational, success!","I have reviewed this tape for 3 weeks now, and I have nothing but good thoughts for this tape! I, at the moment, don't have the skills to master this TaeBo workout, but I have noticed some firmness with my whole entire body. Billy Blanks, does indeed make mistakes with the left\right directional things, but he has a great sense of motivation. If you can overcome that and do workout, I'm sure you will also feel the same way. Goodluck!"
4,Right idea but needs to be more organized,"The set I purchased includes the Advanced and 8-minute workouts. I love the idea behind the workouts, but Billy should spend more time preparing before making the next video. Aside from the miscounts that make you perform more reps on one side than the other (which can be compensated for), is the extremely poor form displayed during the ""double time"" portions (a left hook becomes an ugly combination of a cross and a jab). While this can also be corrected in your own workout, performing techniques that lock the joints at a wreckless speed can cause injury especially to people who are not used to performing such movements. As for the workouts themselves, they are very intense and will definitely produce results. I enjoy all of the tapes and look forward to Billy's future efforts. Again, I encourage you to slow down a little use proper form on the techniques even if Billy doesn't."
4,A Real Help For All Ages,"I am almost 60 years old and never thought that this would be for me. You are never to old to learn,it is great exersize and leaves you feeling wonderful even if you can't kick as high as they do.I may buy the advanced after a few months of limbering up with the basic. I can see improvment in my flexibility after only a week. I find it a great addition to my bowflex routine and my weight watchers diet. 30 lbs off and dropping fast."
