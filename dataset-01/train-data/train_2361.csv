1,Do not buy this book,"This book made me feel depressed and scared about pregnancy and birth - exactly the opposite of what I was looking for. Everything is written in a sarcastic way, which I think was meant to be humor. I found it insulting and factually very inaccurate. In fact, some of her statements are irresponsibly incorrect. I would not want her girlfriends as my own. If you want some facts about childbirth without the fear mongering read The Thinking Women's Guide to Birth by Henci Goer. It's old but the facts remain true today and are based on solid research. As for a guide to pregnancy? I'm not going to waste my money on any other books and will just enjoy the next 7 months - whatever it throws at me."
4,IT WAS A GOOD BOOK,I PURCHASED THIS AND ENJOYED THE COMMENTS AND CONCERNS OF REAL WOMEN. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK :o)
1,A Waste,"I don't recommend this book. The discussion about weight loss was total crap, because I know a few people who have returned at least close to their pre-pregnancy weight within 6 months of having a baby. The more I read the less I liked it. Don't bother!"
1,misleading,"this book had the facts of how horrible it can be to be pregnant, but most of these are rare and only create a sense of fear in the woman reading the book. i strongly urge you not to buy this book... find a midwife or doula in your area that will help discuss your fears instead at a free consult appointment."
1,Don't waste your money,"Vicki Iovine must have cracked herself up writing this book. So to humor her, buy her book. But if you want helpful, truthful information, don't waste your money. I read the entire book and can best describe it as ""cynical"" and ""misleading"". If you are like me, you are excited about your first pregnancy but also feeling that you have much to learn. So buy some books that are actually helpful, like the very famous ""What to Expect When You Are Expecting."" I found Vicki's opinions against exercising during pregnancy really misinformative! (""If you find yourself with extra time on your hands...spend it needlepointing."") Perhaps Vicki wouldn't have had so many complaints about her pregnancies had she followed a sensible prenatal fitness routine. I recommend ""Pregnancy Fitness"", very interesting and informative as well as practical. Enjoy your pregnancy!"
5,LOVED this book. Kept me laughing all the way!,"I have recommended this book to several of my expecting friends, and each of them have equally loved it. I needed the laughter during my lonely pregnancy, and this book provided 100%.I was really surprised reading some of the negative reviews given in this forum. Although, I know not everyone will have the same opinion, I was taken back by one review. I left the following comment with respect to it: ""Being a ""Playmate"" is strictly a label Kelliann Festa has chosen to use against the author. I find it quite offensive to even bring it into context, because the author was already candid about it as well as her LAW background. So, she has looks and brains, too! Face it, the author has a humorous point of view on pregnancy that many people appreciate...regardless of her past! Geesh!"""
5,Funny and light pregnancy reading,I read this book when I was pregnant with my first baby. It was a nice pace from the other serious books. It made me laugh and feel better about my pregnancy and that I wasn't totally out of my mind. She tells you from the beginning that she is not a doctor and its reading for entertainment only. I recommend it for easy reading and a good laugh.
3,"comical, what a friend would tell you...","this is a more light hearted book than any other pregnancy book you'll read. The author admits constantly to not knowing medical reasons for the way things happen during pregnancy but can add some laughter to the changes you're body and emotions are going through. There is one extremely disturbing chapter which makes me discount the whole book, that is her recommendation not to exercise which every pregnant mom knows is a no-no, every doctor will tell you smart exercise is good and helps the baby - for that reason I can not recommend this book to anyone to take anything seriously in it, it's one ladies perspective and she was lucky enough to be able to get it published - take it all as it is - pure gossip and strictly her advise."
1,SO OUTDATED!!,"Part of this book have been okay and other parts of it just annoy me. The whole book is just one woman's opinion of pregnancy, what she thinks you should do, look like, feel, etc. It is also completely outdated. Her chapter on exercise is the worst. She basically says don't do it because it won't help you and you'll get fat anyways. Granted it is her opinion, but there is so much data to prove that women who stay in shape have an easier time in labor. I don't need anymore push to not work out than I already do, I know it is good for me and my baby. Her ideas for dressing during pregnancy are so outdated, you would look rediculous is some of the getups she discribes. All in all, save your money for a book that will really help you from an expert in the field."
1,The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy,"I returned this book after browsing through it for 10 minutes. As a professional and educated woman who is pregnant for the first time at 36, I found it to be inaccurate, shallow and insulting. I am excited about my pregnancy, I intend to maintain a reasonable and safe level of fitness and I found Vicki's advice on diet and exercise (or lack thereof) to be quite frankly absurd. While many women may face legitimate medical reasons to take a break from exercise, her justification of ""not looking good in workout tights"" is nothing short of ridiculous.This book tells you nothing about what's really going on with your body or your baby, other than advising you to always check out your rear end in the mirror before leaving the house as it will be larger in reality than in your mind! I would stay far away from this book!"
1,Misery Loves Company,"This book was given to my pregnant wife by a friend. It seems to be the commentary of a bitter woman with a disrespectful husband saying, ""If you have a baby, you'll look and feel as bad about yourself as I do, so don't bother trying.""Together, we know many woman, who went through pregnancy and look incredible now. Likewise, we know many men who sincerely love and support their wives before, throughout, and after pregnancy. Read this book if you enjoy biting, nasty humor."
1,Negative and badly edited to boot,"Even though I didn't have the easiest of pregnancies, I can't recommend this book to other moms. It perpetuates negative attitudes about a pregnant woman's body shape and gives possibly dangerous medical information disguised as advice. The author's perspective is one that only a wealthy white woman from southern California could have.I'm glad I read this book after my girl was born. Don't pay full price for this book and don't read it until your pregnancy and nursing months are done. It's a weird, very negative view of childbearing.It is also full of misspellings and grammatical errors."
1,Save your money,"Reading this boring, trite, and obnoxiously fluffy book has made me appreciate the bright, funny, and wonderful girlfriends I have in my life. Granted, there are a few humorous moments in this book, but much of the humor is stale. (Perhaps I've been ruined by all the truly funny material I've read in my life.) Please, do yourself a favor: if you must read this book, buy it used - - especially if you can find it at a garage sale!"
3,A disappointment,"I was really looking forward to this book, but overall I felt it was a big letdown. I found the author to be extremely negative. For example, she has an entire chapter devoted to why women who are pregnant should NOT exercise. Truthfully, I am enjoying working out while pregnant and really didn't appreciate her negativity. Also, one thing to keep in mind is that this book is now about 10 years old and hasn't been updated. Some of the fashion advice is truly laughable and really needs to be reworked in order to make this a viable book in this decade."
2,A Little Disappointed,"I got this book as a ""new baby"" gift and I have to agree with the readers who found this book lacking substance. I also thought the humor was silly and in some ways irritating. The author does seem very opinionated - and kind of crude. I did like the non-doctor approach though and the comforting aspect of some of the information, but I think the book ""Your PefectlY Pampered Pregnancy"" does it better - it has the same friendly approach, but the information is so much more in depth and helpful and also very current. I would buy that book first and then buy the Girlsfriends guide as an extra "" read"". If you can only afford one pregnancy book, Girlfriends probably wouldn't be a good choice."
3,Helpful and cute,"The book is written as if your ""girlfriends"" are chatting with you. It's nice to have this side of the story."
5,Great book,I give this book for all my friends who are expecting. It is a funny and informative guide to pregnancy!
1,wish i could get a refund,Everything everyone else has said...has anyone actually counted the number of times she reminds us of getting a huge ass and cellulite? She continually reminds us of her own ridiculous notion that before and after pregnancy you'll be hideously unattractive and never have a life again. There are more important parts to this pregnancy process than weight gain. And how about the insults and stereotypes of the partners? I cant imagine why shed want to go through pregnancy four times with a spouse like she makes hers out to be. My husband would be offended by this book. I hate this book. Not worth the two laughs it caused by the time i put it down in chapter 5.
1,One Star Too Many,"Iovine describes your pregnancy as quite possibly the worst experience anyone could have. Women who elect for a home or natural birth are framed as ""martyrs"", so go ahead and schedule your ceserean now before all of your girlfriends judge the pants off you. Expect to become an incredibly overweight, unattractive lunatic; and anyone who doesn't is obviously depriving their child of nutrition and making life unfair for the rest of us, so be sure to look at them sideways when you pass them on the street. This book was an unfortunate, useless, offensive waste of time."
1,Not funny. Just annoying.,"I found this at a thrift store for $3. That's about $2.75 more than I wish I would've paid. This chick isn't funny. She's a negative nelly who attempts to pass off the worst possible perspective on pregnancy as humor. This coming from me, a ridiculously sarcastic person. This book is written by a nerd for nerds. All it does is annoy you and make you sad. Read the other negative reviews. Some of them are spot on."
1,Left wanting to toss it across the room,"I read everything I could find about being pregnant, since it was my first time. By the time a friend bought me this book, I was hoping for something fun and lighthearted. This reminded me of every other fact filled book out there. If you want something fun, this isint it."
2,Grain of salt,"I'm trying to take this book with a grain of salt. It's not that well written, and I've noticed typos. (It actually said BRIAN instead of BRAIN once. I almost closed the book then and there) In some ways it's been funny, but in other ways I find the author very annoying. She's trying so hard to be clever, and I think some of her advice should not be taken seriously. I don't like her anti-natural birth and anti-midwife stance. Pregnancy books should encourage women to make their own decision.I'll probably keep reading it, but it's hard to for me to take the book too seriously."
3,Very funny - not to be taken seriously,"I thought the book was very funny. I didn't agree with all her views on natural childbirth, among other things, but it didn't bother me too much because I read it for entertainment value. I did get some good tips here and there.I was annoyed at the endless references to her formerly ""skinny self."" Well, she is a former Playboy centerfold!Read it for fun, but don't expect to use it as a medical reference!"
5,First time moms!!,"This book is THE best for first time moms!!!!!After reading so many baby books on what to expect, I loved the humor & ""women talk"" of this book. I was laughing so hard I couldn't put it down!!! The advice is useful and funny and the book is great to share with your hubby & girlfriends.Definately give this as a gift -ASAP- if you know someone is expecting!!!"
4,Should be titled &#65533;Cheerleading Squads Guide to Pregnancy&#65533;,"o.k., I admit I have laughed out loud reading this book. I've read about Vicki's 20 girlfriends who've been pregnant and all of their trials and tribulations with pregnancy & delivery. However, for those of us who have supportive husbands who DO want to have children (and didn't ""knock us up"" by accident) or for those of us who already have imperfect bodies and don't obsess about outgrowing our size 4 jeans, some of her banter is really irritating. The book is a good one to add to the collection but it's not the one to refer to for anything too serious."
1,"New Title: A Rude, Uninformed Housewife's Rant on Pregnancy","A shockingly non-scientific, pop-culture pulpit on pregnancy. Vickie Iovine delivers a snarky and pushy book full of misinformation, anecdotal tales, and rude remarks. It personally offends her when women make pregnancy/birth choices that differ from hers. She promotes things that are actually unsafe for you & baby (drinking wine or a coke, for example) and derides things that are scientifically proven to be helpful, such as moderate exercise during pregnancy. She apparently feels no need to actually research any of her supposedly ""factual"" statements, and in fact on page 75 says (quote) ""If you want something more statistical or analytical you could have read any one of a million other books on pregnancy."" That is the ONLY advice this author gave worth a hoot - I suggest you RUN AWAY from this book and choose something more scientific and classy (and less derogatory towards the male species, perhaps)."
3,"Good, if you're upper-middle class and irreverant","Entertaining and helpful in doing a reality check on some of the more alarmist books. Definetely only for those with a slightly cynical sense of humor and into hospital births.Biggest downside is that she's a size 4 woman with a large disposable income. I'd love to see the same material covered, in the same style by someone who much more resembles me and my girlfriends - sizes 12-16 BEFORE conception and working Dilbert style jobs. Perhaps we could convince Scott Adams to spend some time with us to write a ""Real Woman's Guide to Pregnancy."""
5,This book was fabulous! Much better than What to Expect...,"When You're Expecting. Witty, down-to-earth, and full of truly useful information. This is my first pregnancy, and it answered a lot of my questions (some I didn't even know I had)."
4,I actually liked this book.,"I bought this book to get a humerous tone on pregnancy, instead of the factual look that the ""What To Expect When you are Expecting"" was giving me. I found this book to be refreshing and an easy read. It helped put humor into a lot of what i am feeling while going through my first pregnancy.I felt like Vicki Iovine covered a lot of what people either won't tell you or won't give you the whole truth on. I appreciated her being so candid on all issues.I would definitely give this book to any of my friends who informed me they were now joining the ""Motherhood Club"". This book was exactly what i needed to supplement my now round life."
3,A Funny and Entertaining Read,"In my 6th month, I read this book and it was terrific because it tempers some of the bittersweet experiences of pregnancy with healthy doses of humor. I found myself laughing out loud at a time when I was otherwise beginning to feel a little anxious about approaching the last phase of pregnancy.Don't expect some overly academic or medically bent book here -- (there are plenty of others to choose from if that is what you're looking for). Iovine never positions herself as an expert or presumes to base her information or anything really, other than her own practical experience in having babies. Iovine's writing style is quick and intelligent, and her advice strives to be these things: funny and realistic. It's like hearing the voice of a good friend relate her pregnancy experiences over a good cup of coffee."
3,Not very informative,"I wanted something that was fun to read and was also informative, and I found that it might be fun to read, but not packed with the type of information I was looking for. I also found that the book described situations that may not be applicable to me, so I couldn't really relate. For example, I don't have close girlfriends who'd just had babies. I also didn't find the style very grabbing or amusing. So I returned this book and got ""What to expect when you're expecting"" and ""Your pregnancy week by week."""
2,I didn't find this book very funny,"This book had some useful commentary and I liked that she used her friends as examples, but mostly I thought the jokes were pretty obvious and cheap. I didn't find it clever at all. I also couldn't believe that she recommended no exercise during pregnancy. Exercise kept me fit and relaxed during my whole pregnancy and it was very easy to get back in shape after delivery. Overall this was a big disappointment."
1,These generalizations are untrue and very annoying.,"Hey, ""Girlfriend"", not everyone hates pregnancy, gets hemmorroids, has a beauty-obsessed husband and gains 40 pounds! Regarding exercise, I don't know anyone who stopped because they didn't look good in their leotard. Vicki, wear a big shirt and get over it! Kudos to the reviewers who kept exercising as it makes the rough parts of pregnancy more bearable.For those of you unfortunate enough to be reading this book during your 1st pregnancy, don't be too alarmed, Vicki exaggerates like there is no tomorrow. I had a rough pregnancy but I do realize that some women enjoy it. My question to Vicki is, if you hated it this much, why did you have so many children?"
5,Hilarious!,"I read this book when I was pregnant with my first child at the age of 18, ten years ago. I read it multiple times and did as well with my other three kids. I recommend it to every pregnant woman I meet. It was meant to be a humorous look at pregnancy, entertainment, NOT a medical guide! Vicki used to write a column for one of the baby magazines, and that was always funny as well. I'm not sure what point of view others were coming from when they read it, but it was HILARIOUS! I literally cried I was laughing so hard through most of it. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Helpful and Anecdotal,"A friend gave me this book when I was pregnant, and I have continued to pass it on to other new moms-to-be. I found the book so helpful for normalizing all of the quirks and fears I encountered during pregnancy. It has medical references, but was mostly anecdotal - very much like talking to your best girlfriend. And it was great for some laughs. The author shares from her own personal experiences and those of her friends. I consider it a must have for first time moms-to-be."
3,entertaining and light,"This was an entertaining and light approach on pregnancy matters (some of which are very serious and important) which I truly enjoyed, but if you are looking for solid medical information or advice, this is definitely NOT the book for you. Good to read as a pass time book while pregnant, nothing more."
1,book was never received,"I ordered this book on 3/3/03 but never recieved it. What I did get was an empty manilla envelope in the begining of April. The envelope wasn't even taped by the sender. I sent an email to the person who I bought it from and all I got back was ""what was your book"" and have heard nothing since."
2,In poor taste,"I bought this book only to find myself returning it the following day. Although there were some good tips, the author's ""potty mouth"" took away from anything of great value written here & she definitely did not write this for the average woman in America .If you have any amount of class, not to mention want a more informative medical guide to pregnancy, get a more informative book like ""What to expect while your'e expecting"""
3,Newly Pregnant,I actually didn't care for this book very much compared to other pregnancy books I've read. There was some of the author's opinions in the book that I didn't care for. Over-all it was an okay book.
1,"sure, if you like yuppie pith","I also purchased this book thinking that it would be a welcome respite from the more serious tomes I picked up when I found out I was pregnant, but the writing was mediocre at best and I just couldn't relate at all to Iovine's audience. More than that, I found her book to be just too pithy to be even readable. Her tongue should be pried from her cheek.Pick up the Hip Mama's Guide and other books by Ariel Gore instead, you are guaranteed a far better read."
2,Amusing but dated,I found this book very amusing but since the book is 10 years old some of the info is dated. (ie-stirrup pants and leggings as maternity wear-impossible to find these things in 2005!!)
1,Not very funny or imformative,"After reading other skeptical reviews of this book, I decided not to buy it but picked it up at the library. I'm glad I didn't waste my money. The material in this book is dated (stretch pants?), somewhat sexist (assuming that your partner is a man and that he will be of no use except to bring home the bacon), and slanted (but in all fairness every book is, really). I particularly don't like the authors view on excercise -- which states that you needn't bother because you're going to get fat anyway. Well, yes, you probably will get fat if you eat M&Ms every day. As far as useful information, there is really only the list of things you will need for baby. Which as another reviewer pointed out, you can get in any other pregnancy/baby book. If you are looking for an entertaining pregnancy book I recommend A Bun in the Oven by Kaz Cooke (available on amazonUK). Not only is this book truly funny, it actually contains very useful information."
3,Some good and some bad advice,"I would have never thought about needing to put my new son in snap on shirts (versus onsies) at the begining due to his belly button, but I do not like her attitude towards natural labor. She almost makes herself sound ignorant. At one point, she says something to the effect of why bother with natural labor, pain medication is wonderful.Also, her husband's hands off attitude is disturbing. This may be an OK book for women who will allow their care providers to make all the decisions and not bother to learn about the risks of medical invention. But I would not recommand this book to a woman who plans on educating herself. The author's attitudes and opinions can be annoying."
4,Humorous Look at Pregnancy,"I read this book in the week we found out I was pregnant & laughed through the whole thing. I give my husband much more credit than the author gives men in general, but it was still an entertaining, easy read. I recommend this book as a supplement to all of the serious, practical reading that you'll do throughout your pregnancy. I am glad I read this book before other books and articles scared me into thinking that I must be doing permanent damage to my unborn baby by not eating vegetables every day. It's a unique look at pregnancy, and I recommend it for every mom-to-be who wants to not take herself too seriously."
4,Loved it even though....,"I really did love this book. She had me laughing out loud many times and she really did give me information that no one else did (think mucus plug). The only reason I didn't give her 5 stars is for dismissing the idea of a midwife or other natural form of birth. I feel that whatever way is easiest and healthiest for the woman is just fine, and your not a ""fronteer woman"" if you chose to forgo doctors. Also she centers a lot of the book around not liking the way you look, and taking off the weight. Well I'm not a small girl, and I don't mind. I like my size, and I'm sure I will love my big pregnant belly as well. But again I took her advice like I would a girlfriends, if I agreed fine, but if not that was fine too."
2,Overrated,"This book is completely overrated. The jokes were cheap and obvious, and the advice was poor at best. The only decent message from this book is that pregnancies are different. She tells stories about 4 or 5 of her pregnant friends that are good examples of this, but the friends seem made up just to illustrate the point. Overall I found it to be a real downer. There's a lot to laugh about during pregnancy, but this book doesn't really capture it."
1,This book is VERY negative,"I was given this book by a friend, she said it was hilarious. There were funny parts, but more than funny I found it to be negative. Look, we all know pregnancy & childbirth are not a walk on the beach. I did not learn anything I didn't already know from this book, and found the tone to be extremely negative and it seemed like it was intending to frighten. I think fear is the worst thing for an expecting mother & it can make pregnancy & childbirth that much worse.This book was not informative, enlightening or helpful to me. There were funny parts, but the laughs I had were far outnumbered by the times I felt like the author was trying to scare me to death.If you want a funny light look at pregnancy & childbirth, I recommend Belly Laughs by Jenny McCarthy."
4,What you need to hear!,I received this as a gift and loved it! I have shared it with pregnant friends ever since!
1,Mindless Superficial Fluff!,"That about says it. Apparently the author's definition of a ""Girlfriend"" is a skinny, superficial fashionista for which the worst part of being pregnant is -gasp- gaining the extra weight needed to grow a healthy baby and not being able to fit into Chanel suits in the mean time. If this is you, you might like this book, otherwise find something else to read. I personally found this book to be kind of depressing and insulting. It certainly didn't teach me anything useful about surviving pregnancy."
1,Avoid it,"If a girlfriend ever gave the the advice in this book, especially in the chosen method of delivery, she would not be my girlfriend anymore. This book is simply full of incredible ignorance."
1,offensive and NOT informative.,"This book is terrible and offers advice that is quite backwards. It will shame you for exercising and only encourage and fuel terrible sexist stereotypes, about both men and women. If you have a head on your shoulders, go elsewhere--unless you are looking for a laugh AFTER you've had the baby. But seriously, it's not funny. Someone could use this book in a sociology class looking at the nasty side of gender roles in the USA."
3,"Not a Substitute for ""real"" pregnancy books","This book is very funny, and when you get into that stage of pregnancy where you are getting too serious and obsessive, this book is a welcome break from all the hard-core, more reference-type pregnancy books you may have been reading. This book is NOT a replacement for other books like ""What to Expect When You're Expecting,"" but is a fun read when you are bored and need to smile or laugh about the whole experience. The only thing I could not identitfy with were Iovine's complaints about her husband. She writes as though all men are football-watching, beer-swilling fools who are simply waiting for your pregnancy to be over so they can have sex with you again. But other than that silly characterization of husbands, I found her book to be funny and fun to read. This is a book to ""take a break"" with, and by NO MEANS is meant to be the sole book on pregnancy that you own or refer to."
5,A Definate Purchase For the Mother-to-be,"Reading this book made one of the most scary times of my life somewhat bearable. Controlling the laughing out loud was nearly impossible when I carried this book with me everywhere I went during the week it took me to read it. I would recomend this book to anyone, especially first time mothers. It explains a lot of those questions you are too ashamed to ask your doctor. I cannot wait to get a hold of The Girlfriends Guide to the First Year and The Girlfriends Guide to Toddlers!"
5,A New Mother's Best Friend!,"This book is my bible. Every time I think I am going nuts, I would find I was not alone. This book has no fear, and goes into everything most of us could never have the guts to admit we are going through. I can't begin to tell you what a valuable addition this has been to my pregnancy library. I love Vicki, and I will be looking forward to reading the childhood books once this baby is born."
4,"A funny, relaxing read","While I don't agree with everything that the author promotes (I do not think an occasional glass of wine is ok, and I do not agree that you should be drinking coffee whenever you feel like it) the book is very funny and takes you mind off of the more serious stuff for a while. So you don't agree with everything, shkip what you don't like. This isn't meant to be a medical book or a What to Expect book, but rather a funny, laugh-out-loud look at pregnancy. Put your feet up, grab a (healthy) snack, and enjoy!"
2,Disappointing,"I received this book as a pregnancy gift, and I can only say that I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I applaud the concept of examining the lighter side of pregnancy, but I found this book to be completely superficial. Iovine is clearly OBSESSED with her physical appearance . . . she mentions repeatedly throughout the book how thin she was before her pregnancy, and most of the pages are devoted to her ongoing concerns about her looks during and after pregnancy. Of course this is a concern for most pregnant women, but I hardly think it's the most important issue raised by the life-altering miracle of pregnancy and childbirth! Isn't motherhood supposed to make us a little less self-absorbed?!"
1,wish I could give it 0 stars,"This book had such potential to be really really great and fun to read. That is until the writer started adding all of her thoughtless, judgemental opinions. I didn't buy this book to feel judged and sneered at. I couldnt believe how judgemental she was on nursing, natural childbirth, unmarried mothers, etc. Maybe someone should tell this ex playboy bunny that her breasts are actually for nursing and not to be used to exploit herself only to write a mindless book once the flash bulbs are burnt out. I also felt like this book should have been published in 1950 based on all the time spent on making excuses for husbands who arent interested in you because of how ""huge"" you get. I dont have any girlfriends who are this unaware, so there for this is not my guide to pregnancy."
5,Fun and Enjoyable,"I'm in the first trimester of my first pregnancy. I bought this book because I had already purchased ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" and it was not helpful to me. Sure it gives you a lot of details on what miseries you'll probably go through, but I wanted a book that would help me ENJOY my pregnancy. The Girlfriends Guide really helped me. I don't feel so stressed about doing everything just right. I know that the baby will be fine if I eat a few ""bad"" things. This book is really a great read if you're looking for something that won't be judgmental and make you feel like you're doing everything wrong. I really loved this book!"
4,Good book for first time mothers,This is a good book very funny and somewhat informational. Gave you the information that everyone needs to know in a comedic way good way to present this topic.
5,The best pregnancy book available!,"Vicki puts her readers at ease immediately. She uses a blend of humor and compassion to ""tell it like it is."" I read it during both of my pregnancies and was able to laugh my way through morning sickness and stretch marks. My husband even thought it was very funny. I recommend to anyone pregnant or even simply thinking about having a baby. You won't be disappointed!."
2,Emphasizes the horrors of pregnancy.,"While the author is very funny about many aspects of pregnancy, she portrays the pregnant woman as a helpless victim of the medical system."
2,"Yes, I laughed. But I was horrified at some attitudes...","Vicki Iovine's advice seems to be: get to the hospital, get the drugs and get the baby out. A holistic approach, this is not. If you are planning a home birth, steer clear. The 'foolish man' attitude to partners wore a bit thin after a while too.Forget this book, and get Vicki Iovine's Diary instead. It's got all the funny bits (copied directly from the above book) to do with fashion and feelings, without all the dodgy healthcare advice."
1,A rather disturbing view of pregnancy,"I found this book to be annoying at best, and rather disturbing on the whole. Absolutely NONE of the ""10 lies about pregnancy"" were true for me when I carried and gave birth to my two daughters. As a whole, I found it to more of the tripe that encourages women to view pregnancy as a disease that requires medical intervention, rather than a natural process that usually turns out well when intelligently managed in concert with an midwife or obstetrician. I would never give this book to a pregnant friend, since the overall sarcastic and pessimistic tone would likely fuel any anxiety she already had about the birth process. Frankly, I discreetly discarded this book quite soon after receiving it as a gift from my mother."
1,I would return it if I hadn't thrown away the receipt,"I bought this book for myself, along with ""The Expectant Father: Facts, Tips, and Advice for Dads-To-Be"" for my fiancee. While his book actually contains practical and interesting advice; this one is just a bunch of superficial complaints from someone who obviously takes pregnancy for granted. ""The Girlfriend's Guide..."" is probably just the thing if your relationship is based on looks and money instead of love and support (""my husband will leave me if I stop dyeing my hair during the pregnancy""), but for the rest of us, it doesn't provide any helpful information at all."
1,A dumb book for a dumb public,"If you consider yourself a smart woman, please stay away from this pseudo literature. I can't help thinking that people who like this book are just as brainless as the author. It's hard to believe that someone had the courage to publish this. How embarrassing for herself!"
5,A MUST for any pregnant gal,"I am more than 6 months pregnant and had heard a lot of my friends mentioning this book so I decided to give it a read. I read half the book in one sitting, most of the while laughing at it, at myself, and at the illusions I had previously about pregancy. This is a no-nonsense-here-are-some-of-the-stark-truths-about-what-your-body-is-and-will-continue-to-go-through-book. I can't tell you how relieved I was to find out that some of the ""body issues"" I was wrestling with were universal and NORMAL. She covers myths, insecurities we all got through, she offers helpful hints, and all with a dash of humor. It's like having a best friend there to walk you through this...one whose been there done that and won't judge you if all you had for dinner that night was a bowl of hagan daaz."
5,The Best Pregnancy Book Ever!,"My friend bought this book for me when I was 8 weeks pregnant. I loved the humor & all of the advice throughout the book. Before I read this, I started to read What to Expect. That only scared me because it mentioned the ""M"" word a lot & to a first time mom-to-be, I had enough uncertainties on my own. I didn't need a book to bring it up constantly.The Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy is a must have for any pregnant woman. It paints a great picture of what to expect in your changing body, your mood & even gives insight about what your husband will be going through.And just a side note, yesterday we found out that we are having a little girl!"
5,funny and helpful,I really enjoyed this book. Although slightly dated it's really funny. The author needs to update it.
4,Good for Laughs,"I read this book while three months pregnant and on a cruise. It was given to me by a girlfriend who said that it was not a reference book but more light and humorous reading. Approaching it as such, it was a very good book that kept me entertained. I even passed it to my husband on occasion so he could read snippets of it and understand what I was going through during those first few months of pregnancy. If you are looking for a serious book that has lists of what to and what not to do, look elsewhere. If you are looking for something that will make you laugh and reassure you that you are not alone, like a good girlfriend get-together, this is for you."
1,Great for women seeking ignorance,"If you want helpful, real and informative information about pregnancy and birth, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! The book is based on one woman's negative and ignorant view of a beautiful and natural process. At one point she compares the mess of childbirth to a pig slaughter. It is disturbing to read absolute lies and medical misinformation. Her viewpoint on husbands are a flashback to the 1940's when the dad's were not involved in the pregnancy/birth process at all. This book preaches ignorance!It is shallow, immature and at some points completly WRONG in her misguided advise. It is sad to think that a first time mom will read this book and get such a negative perspective of what can be a happy, healthy and empowering time is her life. In short, this is THE WORST pregnancy/birth book I have ever read and I would not recomend it to any woman who seeks knowledge and truth."
1,GIRLFRIENDS GUIDE TO STUPIDITY,NUMBER ONE: SHE SAYS DONT EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY? SHE IS A BIGGER DITZ THEN I THOUGHT.NUMBER TWO: DONT READ THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE UNDER UPPER CLASS. THIS IS FOR CHANEL SUIT WEARING SNOBS!DONT READ THIS DUMB BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE INSULTED
2,Not for those desiring responsibility in pregnancy.,"I found this book to be chatty and fun, but not full of much solid information uponwhich to base informed birth choices. I must say, however, that it doesnot promise to be the birth book for the Earth Mother. If you don't want anepidural, this book is not for you"
1,One of the few books I've actually thrown away,"Granted it has a few good parts, but most of it is trash with terrible advice -- for example, there is a whole section devoted to why a pregnany lady should not exercize. TERRIBLE! Exercize is a wonderful thing for an expecting mom! It speaks terribly of men, assuming that they are all arrogant pigs (or at least trying to convince you of it!) I could see it taking an already hormonal woman and making her terribly upset with her husband or seeing things so negatively that false problems begin to be created. I kept trying to find a use for this book, but in the end, I didn't want to encourage anyone to read it by even giving it away. I threw it in the trash and felt much better about that; I feel that with all of the terrible advice and opinions that it offered, that is where it belongs."
1,No medical facts!!!,"While this book my be humerous it lacks honest medical facts. I know she does admit to not being a doctor, but my fear is that people will follow her advice anyway. In my opinion you should only read this book if you want to laugh or are willing to read some more serious book that tell you about all the risks that come along with the medical model of birth..."
3,"Ok, but borrow from a friend..","I must confess I was a little dissapointed in this book. I found it to be very opininated and not too informative. In fact, she tells you NOT to exercise. I have several other books I enjoyed much more. You really want a girlfriend's guide, get Belly Laughs."
2,Mildly entertaining but low on content,"The Girlfriend's Guide is written in a breezy, engaging style, but for a first time expectant mother, it provided very little information. Worse yet, it seems jaded. If you favor unchallenging chick lit, then the Girlfriends' Guide is your book."
1,"there are other, better books","My best friend and I were disappointed in this book. While seemingly written to be humorous, we strongly feel that the underlying message of this book is to encourage and to validate being bitchy or whiny during pregnancy. It wasn't a book I could share with my husband because he was offended in the first chapter. If you want good books that answer your pregnancy questions, try ""What to Expect When You are Expecting"" or Dr. Sears' ""Birth Book."""
2,"GIRLFRIENDS, HERE'S THE REAL SCOOP...","I held my nose and read it. Now I wish I hadn't. There are bits of helpful information sprinkled throughout this book BUT Vicki Iovine is crude, negative and superficial. Are those the qualities you'd look for in a ""girlfriend""? There are really good books out there for women who are happy to be pregnant, who want to be educated about the process and know their options--this IS NOT one of them. Happy healthy pregnancy!!"
2,not worth buying- just borrow it!,"Thank goodness i had a friend lend me this book. It had some funny personal stories-especially in the beginning. However it gets repetitive fast, and after all is not any medical advise. Some advise i found out is just a lie. They have a good amount to say about exercising being a waste of time. To pay for bad advice-it's crazy....try to read it at the library."
2,Better Books to read,"I bought this book, because so many people have had such rave reviews. While I do like that the author has a laid back attitude, this wasn't the book for me.My husband and I plan to conceive within the next couple of months. After reading this entire book, it made me want to put off trying for a child. In my opinion it didn't seem like the author enjoyed her pregnancy and it comes through in her experiences. I guess I was looking for a book that made light of all the negatives to pregnancy where as this book made them seem even worse. Not a book for everyone."
1,Disappointing,Very badly written and lacking scientific approach. I can not believe its suggestions regarding exercise. I wish I hadn't bought this book.
2,Not Worth It,"This book is too simplistic and basic and doesn't really go as depth into the type of information we were looking for as new parents.There are also editing and medical mistakes including calling Toxoplasmosis a bacteria (which it is not, it is in fact a Protozoa, it's own classification of infectious organisms) and leads me to think what else is not quite right.We didn't finish this book and instead opted for some of the more well known, better rounded and more in-depth books in this category to get our information.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone I knew."
1,If I could give negative stars I would...,Don't waste your time. Vikki's negative view of pregnancy would be hardly missed. Do your self a favor and don't waste you time or money!
3,"Ehhhh..Don't love it, don't hate it....","This book is on the fence for me. I bought this book thinking it would be a humours twist on the joys of pregnancy. Mind you it was funny, but overall, I found it alarmingly negative. It scared me at some points. This is not a good book if you are at all insecure with being pregnant or you have not read any other books about pregnancy. I would not recommend this book to first time moms.I also found the book out of date in alot of areas. Such as Maternity Fashion and Nursery Items. Things have changed alot since '95 and there are indeed fashionable pregnancy clothing.I enjoyed the fact that she was very frank about weight and exersicing, but I would definately keep up with exersice during pregnancy."
3,Entertaining but Outdated,"I thought this book was mildly entertaining somewhat outdated. Her chapter on maternity clothes was pretty much worthless unless you are living in 1985 and hope to carry on the fashions of that era. Her opinion on your own mother's advice applies more to my GRANDMOTHER'S advice rather than my own Mom. She also seems to have some issues with both her Mother and her husband, and in my life (as well as many other women I know) those two people rank much higher than my girlfriends on my list of people who support, love and understand me.Despite all that much of her advice seems right on the money and offers quite a few laughs. Her list of what to take to the hospital and what to have on hand for your newborn are worth the price of this book alone."
3,STOP!,"If you want to have children, do not purchase this book. This is the scariest pregnancy book I have ever read. The things that she discusses in this book made me truly reconsider getting pregnant. It was so scary! I can't believe it! I actaully have nightmares because of this book.The author is extremely funny and it is a quick read, I had it finsihed in 2 days. It is real funny until you realize that she is talking about real people and then it is just plain scary."
2,NOT everything your doctor won't tell,"Yes, it was funny, but it could've been more responsible. EVERYTHING your doctor won't tell is quite a claim, and it simply doesn't begin to live up to it. Though it's a good laugh, every book on natural childbirth that I've read has been far more informative."
5,Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy,What a wonderful book! Do you or do you know someone who freaks out at all the information that is thrown at you/them during pregnancy? Do you or this other pregnant person seem to be overwhelmed w/all the things that can go wrong during pregnancy? THIS is the BOOK for them or yourself (if you're pregnant)! This book has a sense of humor about the state of being pregnant & informs it's reader. I'm not saying it should be the only reference book during pregnancy but it helps you laugh through the scary moments & not take the experience too seriously.I highly recommend this book to all pregnant moms w/a sense of humor & in need of a good laugh.p.s.They also make the Girlfriends Guide to the 1st Year.
5,Sure to Make a Pregnant Woman Laugh!,I have to say I found myself laughing a lot while reading this book! And it really kept my mind busy while I was worrying in the beginning of everything. Its well written and not medical so you don't find yourself online after looking up stuff and getting more worried. I loved it and I recommend this book to any newly pregnant women!
4,useful advice from a been there mom,"I found this book very helpful in terms of what to expect and how to cope. The parts on what to bring to the hospital (and why), how to deal with pesky symptoms of pregnancy and getting ready for the baby were useful. The only caveat, as she herself reiterates, is that she is not a physician, and some of the medical aspects of the book were inaccurate. Still, she covers a lot of what one's doctor does not."
4,Great Read for Soon To Be Moms AND Dads!,This book was filled with great information as well as humor. I laughed and learned all at the same time.If you are going to be a new parent soon. This is a MUST READ!Enjoy!
5,VERY FUNNY AND TURE! MUST READ!,I FOUND THIS BOOK TO FIT ME ALMOST TO A TEE. I ENJOYED READING IT AND LEARNED ABOUT THINGS NOBODY ELESE WILOL TELL YOU ABOUT! I THINK THAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TURE WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU.
4,Cute book,"I found The Girlfriends Guide to be cute and informative but was rather bothered by the weight issue. The author suggests to forget exercise, forget watching your weight just EAT! I don't agree. I'm newly pregnant and I plan to exercise (moderately) and watch what I eat. I had a friend who followed ""the girlfriends"" advice and she gained 75 pounds. (25 of which she is still carrying around today)Overall very good book but don't take all to heart."
1,Not funny at all,"A friend recommended this book to me when I became pregnant. I really cannot recommend anybody to buy this book if you want to get a realistic idea of what pregnancy is going to be. If you follow her advice to not work out anymore and eat for two, yes, you will indeed outgrow your husbands cloths. That was actually the end of reading for me."
1,Don't waste your time!,This book was the worst out of all the ones I read...the author had a negative view on everything.
1,If you are thinking of getting pregnant - don't read this book!,"My husband and I are excitedly looking at the possibility of starting a family. Unfortunately, this is the first book I read in preparation. It started out pretty funny, amusing even. The author is witty and refreshing initially, but after a while, her advice seems jaded, almost bitter. I felt like she was trying too hard to be funny and in doing so, concentrated on the negative aspects of pregnancy. Having not been pregnant before, I was seriously distressed to read that, according to her, you would get fat, have terrible gas, and basically be miserable for 10 months.The more I read, the more depressed I became. I finally had to put the book down and seek a reliable source - my mother (who ordered me to stop reading it at once!) If you are thinking of having a baby, I recommend you do the same."
2,better books out there,"Some of the medical information in this book was wrong. There are better books out there for expectant moms. What to Expect... (boring but good information), Baby Bargains, Baby 411, Babyville, anything by Dr. Sears."
2,Dated,"I realize that the world was different ten years ago, but it's hard not to laugh out loud when the author regards single-income families as the norm, recommends stirrup pants with boots, bodysuits and large jackets as the perfect maternity fashion solution (and has evidently never heard of GAP.com, let alone the Internet), and name-checks Giorgiou perfume (yeccch!).This book might be fun if you're looking for a good belly laugh, or one woman's perspective on the experience of pregnancy in the 1980's, but otherwise I'd leave it on the shelf."
1,Not Big on Childbirth Options,"This woman believes there is only one way to give birth, with an epidural administered as soon as you discover you're pregnant. She belittles women who seek other alternatives such as natural childbirth or water birth and outright dismisses people who give birth at home as wackos.She believes any woman who chooses natural childbirth can only be doing so because they see it as a badge of honor and respect among other mothers, not because it's healthier and safer for both mother and baby.This woman strikes me as someone who breaks out the vicodin everytime she stubs her toe and spent hours obsessing over how her pregnancy was ruining her looks forever.Spend your money on a less judgmental, pessimistic book that advocates option."
3,fair,"If you choose to read this book just keep in mind that the author is very opinionated. She bases her book on her own pregnancy ""rules"" and defines what you ""should and should not"" do based on her ""opinion"". Take it with a grain a salt. If she wanted to do it she found reasons it was okay during pregnancy. (ie. coloring her hair) but if she didn't want to do something, such as exercise, she advises everyone against it or tries to make you feel you're doing something wrong if you do. Nothing is based on research or fact. I did find a few chapters informative and fun to read."
1,Worst book on pregnancy ever,"I don't usually write reviews on the internet, unless a product is especially good or especially bad. This is the worst guide to pregnancy you could possibly imagine. Vicky Iovine has major issues about her pregnant body, and is completely clueless to the needs of the average American woman because she is married to a very wealthy record producer and has no concept of budgeting her money or having to work while pregnant. My girlfriends and I passed this book around a couple of years ago, and were horrified. You will actually dread pregancy after reading this nonsense, which is a shame. Shame on you Vicky - please don't write any more books."
1,Ridiculous...,"If you're looking for a humor book, something to make you laugh, this book is right up your alley. If you're looking for a book that actually gives you well-researched, *safe* and healthy advice for you and your baby -- Ms. Iovine's glib and dangerously inaccurate throwaway quips about everything from c-sections to breastfeeding are mind-boggling in their wrongness -- please go read ""A Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth"" by Henci Goer instead.Again, this is a humor book. Whether you find Ms. Iovine's sense of humor actually funny or if you find her complete cluelessness about real pregnancy and birth issues laughable, that's your call. But please don't count on this woman for sound pregnancy advice."
2,Should've saved my $$$...,"When I read the other online reviews for this particular book, I thought that I, too had to have it so I could enjoy what everyone else was. The problem is after I finished the third or fourth chapter, I became bored with the book. Some parts were funny, but the writing just kept on and on and I got no humor or interest out of it. If anything, I found a cure for the ever present insomnia a lot of expectant mothers get during their pregnancies. And for that reason alone did this book get 2 stars from me--and that was being generous. I say save your cash and buy Jenny McCarthy's ""Belly Laughs: The Naked Truth About Pregnancy and Childbirth"" or ""Pregnancy Sucks: How You're Little Miracle Can Make You Miserable."" BOTH were legitimately funny and ""Pregnancy Sucks"" also had some informative info enclosed."
2,Outdated - Needs an Update!,"I borred this book from a friend, and I am glad that I did. The humor in this book is often lacking, I have read funnier pregnancy books. The material is quite outdated, such as her recommendations for maternity wear - I can not relate to her outfits, or to her ideas to wear a vest over a big shirt, borrowing my husbands clothing, or to long flowy dresses. Much of the material which was supposed to be funny, I found quite negative (exercise portion, the sex). This book published in 1995 should stay in 1995. Updates to the material are definately in order."
1,"Lame, Lame, Lame","I am a young mom-to-be, as well as a ""former"" teen mom. A previous reviewer mentioned that this book seemed geared towards a younger audience, well let me tell you, not a chance! Any intelligent woman who cares about her body and knows she's damn beautiful and amazing pregnant would be insulted by this book. Another young, first time mom in my office raved about this book, so I was motivated by my curiosity to see why so many people seemed to love it. I was completely disgusted by this woman's laissez-faire, ""princess""-like attitude. I managed to slog through most of this book just because I like to finish what I start, but this woman tries way too hard to be hip and ends up just sounding snotty. For some WAY better light-hearted reading about pregnancy and parenting, read anything by Hip Mama's Ariel Gore, such as ""The Hip Mama Survival Guide"", ""Breeder"" and ""The Mother Trip"". Happy reading!"
3,my wife did not like it that much,"Since it is such a best-seller, we probably had too high expectations for this book.My wife like the beginning of it but then found it to be repetitive.She thinks the stories are longer than they need to be as if to make the book longer."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This book is starting to seem quite outdated, and the author's opinions are downright offensive in some places in the way that they present opinion as fact. As someone who planned a natural birth with midwives and ended up with a hospital induction without an epidural (mind you, I have nothing against epidurals for other people, just didn't want one myself) and who is a big believer in breastfeeding, I probably was not going to like this book from the beginning. The kicker, though, was her stereotypical view of fathers-to-be. Her presentation of men did not ring true to my experience with my husband and was a big turnoff. Yes, there were still a few funny parts, but overall, this book was too far off from my worldview to be a good fit for me at all."
2,"Interesting, by stereotypical","While there were a few things in there that most women do not talk about, the rest of the book was full of pregnancy entitlement.Tired? Put your feet up and have your husband do all the housework! Just take it easy on yourself - YOU deserve it!While I am all for taking it easy when you need to, this book tries to give any pregnant woman a license to do nothing. I'd skip this book if you were looking for a more informative book."
4,Great Read!!,"As a first time expectant mother I could definitely relate to much in this book. The author is hilarious at times!My advice to any expectant mother is to relax and read this book. Very informative, too."
4,Funny and true (mostly),"This book was recommended to me by a friend, and is a fantastic deviation from the usual what-to-expect type books. While it is not necessarily a true ""guide"", any pregnant woman or mother can definitely relate to most of the topics, even though some are definitely a bit dramatic. A good way to pass the time before you have none of your own."
5,A Fun Read While Pregnant,"Sometimes, when you're pregnant, you have to take a break from all the serious medical literature that you find yourself reading and have a good laugh. If you need a good laugh, make sure to take a look at this book. Although a lot of the information is humorously eye-opening for a first pregnancy, I think most women will get a kick out of this candid look at all that we go through during pregnancy each time."
3,Good read but...,"When I my pregnancy was first confirmed, I went and purchased this book. A lot of it didn't pertain to me then, and it doesn't now. This is just the author's view and experience with her pregnancy and her friend's experiences.What annoyed me the most was her overuse of the 'yelling voice' by using capitalization LIKE THIS FOR THE ENTIRE SENTENCE. I get the point without the need to emphasize even more.Other readers found the book funny, I didn't giggle or laugh at any passage or section. I'd say about half the content is useful in the end."
5,"This is the book you're looking for, people!!","This book tells it the way I wanted to hear it: realistically!! The only thing was, she kept talking about how skinny she was before she got pregnant(size four). Not everyone can relate,(especially me!) but the rest of it was wonderful. Do yourself a favor and get this book."
3,Fun Read,"Being newly pregnant, I thought this was a fun book to read. I have technical books on pregnancy but it is nice to hear the perspectives of other ""Girlfriends"" in a blunt, humorous way. Highly recommend purchasing this as a used paperback book which I did through amazon."
4,The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy,This was a great book! Great for a little comic relief sometimes.
3,nothing more than entertaining,"While some of this book brought a smile to my face, other parts made me incredulous. Sometimes, it seems as if Vicki is giving terrible advice. For example, she suggests foregoing all exercise during pregnancy while eating everything your heart desires. She blithely suggests that you can just lose the weight after delivery. With girfriends like this... Read this book for entertainment only. Look to other more factually-based pregnancy books for real advice."
2,Disappointing,"I had high expectations regarding this book! However, I was totally turned off by it. Most women I have talked to at least liked being pregnant (some even LOVED it), but obviously this woman was not one of them. If you like to complain or listen to people complain, this book is for you! I appreciated the lists of things to bring to the hospital and suggestions regarding what products were helpful, but found the negative comments tiresome (such as the one suggesting exercise outside where there aren't any mirrors). I received WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU ARE EXPECTING from my OB/GYN. It was a breath of fresh air after this book. As it turns out, my first pregnancy ended in miscarriage, but WHAT TO EXPECT had an entire section on when things go wrong, unlike the Girlfriends' Guide. I tossed the Girlfriends' Guide and have What to Expect in my bookshelf for future reference. Once you are on a hormonal roller coaster, the Girlfriends' Guide loses its charm rather quickly."
1,GOOD FOR COMEDY ONLY,"This book should be read for the comedic aspects ONLY. Mrs. Iovine might mean well, but I think she is misinformed and makes too light of what interventions in hospitals can mean for mother and infant. To counter the effects of this book, I highly recommend a trip to [...]compleatmother[...]and find out about birth from a completely different perspective."
5,Hilarious!!! at last a book talking about you and not the baby,Recommend it for everyone! my husband liked it a lot too.I wish the first chapter of the girlsfriend guide to the first year was in this book instead. BUy Both and read them before the baby is born.I got hit by a postpartum blues stage that did not let me read through the other book until I had passed that stage... should I had had the other book or read the first chapter....I might have been a little less concerned about feeling like an alien had possesed me....
3,"Good, but not as positive as one would hope","I bought this book because I am hoping to be pregnant soon and wanted to find out what was in store. While the book was very enlightening and VERY funny, it was kind of negative in many aspects and did not talk about how pregnancy would affect your life in a GOOD way. It didn't address feelings other than in regards to out-of-control hormones. I was expecting to see more about the bond between mother and child. There was lots of good information on what changes to expect in your body and what baby things you will need. All was done in the context of having a conversation w/ a good Girlfriend."
5,Laughter is the best medicine...,"Loved this book, For my first pregnancy, Vicki and her friends answered all the questions I had, and taught me some things that would otherwise have been major surprises. Thanks for a great laugh at a time when I really needed it!"
1,"If you have a fear-based pregnancy, this is a perfect book for you!","I read the last chapter of this book right before I went to sleep. I had nightmares for a few hours and then woke up at 3 am and couldn't go back to sleep. I shouldn't have read the pages and pages of writing coming from fear right before I closed my eyes! This book touched upon most women's fears - the things they make up about their bodies, husband having flings, labor and delivery being so painful that there's no way that anyone in their right mind could ever have a natural childbirth, a future with no sex. It took me hours to go back to sleep (8 am) and get this all out of my system. There are so many more empowering pregnancy books out there - this one isn't one of them. I'm grateful that the experiences of my girlfriends are so different and more conscious!"
5,Informative while Amusing,"The premise of this book is that what we really need during pregnancy is a ton of good advice and a ton of good cheer. The information in the book is accurate, but not medically thorough (if you want that, please see ""What to Expect when you are Expecting""). It is shared amusingly. If you need belly laughs and good ideas, this is your book. It is the one that I have shared with multiple girlfriends who have told me that they are pregnant. My own copy is dogeared and has pages falling out.This is the book for you if you want to know that you should bring a snack for after your blood sugar test. Or that you should buy clothes that either go over the bump or under it, or face your clothes rolling up like a roller window blind. For most of us who are pregnant we get advice everywhere we turn, but some of it is highly questionable. Here the advice is very good."
5,An entertaining read to quell your worries,"To avoid build-up of pregnancy anxiety I had chosen to read this book first before I had read any serious ""how-to"" books on pregnancy and labor. I am glad I did! Every expecting mother has enough worries about what lies ahead, so this book is great to quell the anxiety and to make you feel ""normal"" while abnormal things are happening to you. Any expectant mother can identify with the hilarious stories that Vicky shares with the readers. It's a fun read! But don't count on this book to be the pregnancy Bible and know-it-all resource. ""Pea in a Pod"" by Linda Goldberg is a great reference guide, while ""Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy"" is a relaxing read for Moms with a sense of humour!"
2,meh,"i read this while i was pregnant and i found it to be outdated and annoying. put it this way, i LOVE to read, and very rarely dislike a book. i threw this one in the recycling bin!"
1,"Funny, but not worth the money.","The friendly funy tone can be entertaining at times, but the author's obsession with her weight and cellulite really ruined this book. It seems like her main concern with pregnancy was how much weight she would gain. It is good to have a realistic view of your body. However, Vicki Iovine's portrayal of the pregnant woman's body is NOT at all helpfull."
1,A Truely Poor Experience To Read!,"Please don't believe anything this woman says. She is negative, condescending and makes pregnancy sound like a horrible experience for everyone. Although some of the stories are humorous, you are still left with the feeling that you are fat, your husband will never find you attractive again and if you don't have the same miserable experience that she did then you aren't normal. A HORRIBLE BOOK TO READ!"
2,Do NOT read this book,"I bought this book for myself when I was about 4 months pregnant, and thought that it was the worst book in the world for a pregnant woman to read!! I really hated the part where she said that when my husband told me that I was still beautiful that he was lying and when my friends said that they couldn't tell that I was pregnant, that they were just being nice. From what I understand, this woman is not a doctor, and I certainly wouldn't want her as a 'girlfriend'. There are MUCH better books to be read of there."
3,What the book review doesn't tell you:,"While I admit I was holding my sides with laughter several times while reading this book, I was disappointed by the author's view of pregnancy and childbirth. Mrs. Iovine's view of pregnancy came across a little on the misogynist side. She discusses ""scheduling"" her induction into labor so she's not surprised in the middle of the night, and asking her doctor to sew her up a bit tighter . If your pregnancy and childbirth style is more on the natural side then this book can be checked out at the library for a laugh. However, if you're concerned about breaking a nail during labor, this book is right up your alley!"
1,Discouraging and Depressing,"When my wife read through this book she got depressed -- not only because of the negative, simplistic tone, but also because it seemed to mirror the back-handed compliments and ""encouragement"" she was getting from less supportive, less friendly, passive-aggressive acquaintances. The jokes on the cover of the book are a clue, ranging from a cartoon of a stretch mark to one of ugly ""maternity chic"" clothing. My wife's a good sport, but the hormones do rage and emotions are unpredictable when a woman is pregnant. There is no reason to risk it with this book. I sure wish I hadn't."
1,This book IS a joke,"Sure, read this book if you want a good laugh--and that's all. I picked up this book in the bookstore and read through it during my first trimester, trying to find some good books to guide me through my first pregnancy. I was so offended I put it right back on the shelf. Her advice on breastfeeding, midwives, and exercise and diet during pregnancy, is just plain ignorant and represents her lack of knowledge in these (and other) areas. Reading the part about her getting dressed up to see her obstetrician was, like another reviewer commented, creepy.There are so many other excellent books to choose from when you are pregnant, that offer real advice (NOT scary information, like others have commented). What a woman needs when she's pregnant is positive encouragement and useful information during a joyous but at times anxiety-ridden journey in life.This book is just a joke and an insult to the beautiful experience of pregnancy."
5,Now I know what I'm getting into.....,"I am probably one of the few that chose to read this book BEFORE I actually got pregnant. And let me tell you, boy, was it an eye-opener! I had a fairy-tale vision about what pregnancy and labor were about. In their efforts to put the baby-pressure on, none of my girlfriends had ever mentioned the sometimes unpleasant realities associated with pregnancy & labor. It was so refreshing to take awy the rose-colored glasses and hear someone say, it can and will be rough, but it is also worth it. I learned more than I ever expected to from this book, much of it gross and not necessarily something to look forward to, but at least I know I'll be going into this nine-month adventure with my eyes wide open. And in the meantime, I have a lot more empathy for my pregnant friends. I wish all books were this forthright!"
5,One of my favorite pregnancy books!,"I love this book and the 2 others that follow it (first year and toddlers) although this is my favorite. I am in my 4th pregnancy and I still read it all the time. Vicki has been there and has put her own views and experiences into something that is light-hearted for all expectant mothers to read. Whether it is for comic relief (who couldn't use it at a time like this?) or for knowing someone else has been there and thought the same things you are. When a friend talks about her experiences with epidurals during labor or whether or not she breast-fed her kids, you don't take it to mean that you should do the same things. It's her thoughts and feelings. I laughed out loud the first time I read this book and about the millionth time I am now going through it. I don't know where I would be without this book!"
4,A Great way to ease the nervousness,I read this book after learning of my first pregnancy. It helped ease the nervousness I felt about the changes that I was about to go through over the next 9 months. I highly recommend it for any first time moms to be.
3,I guess I'm in the minority but I thought - just OK,"I found this book light/humorous and easy to read - although towards the end was happy to have finished it. It was somewhat of a let down for me but this was the first pregnancy book I read - maybe had I saved it for my 2nd or 3rd pregnancy book I would of appreciated it more. The author felt walking through metal detectors at the airport was risky but didn't see a problem with having an occasional glass of wine during pregnancy? I don't get it. I did find the discussion on ""what to bring to the hospital"" very helpful. If you have some extra time/money and have already read the more formal/factual pregnancy books, then its not bad."
4,"Witty, accurate and fun to read","I enjoyed The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy because it made me laugh, it made me nod my head in agreement and most importantly, it made me realize I really wasn't crazy with some of the things I was thinking, feeling and doing during my pregnancy. If you can laugh at yourself, you will enjoy The Girlfriends' Guide. Not everything Ms. Iovine says will ring true for you but I imagine many things will. If you like books like this one that contain the ""real truth"" about pregnancy, you may also enjoy We're Pregnant!, a realistic, down-to-earth look at life as expectant parents from the viewpoint of both an expectant mother and an expectant father. The two books together will give you a true idea of what to expect as your pregnancy progresses."
3,Just ok use your own common sense,"My friend gave me this book and spoke very highly of it. I read it from front to back. Many times I felt that the author was very negative and had a very old fashioned view of women and being pregnant. Much of this book was opinions made to sound facutal. That is when I used my own common sense to figure out if what she was saying was accurate or just biased. Everyone has a different pregnency than others and not one person can say what is right or wrong for another person. Many times I rolled my eyes in this book.However, on a positive note I did laugh in this book. Also on many points I felt that she did deliver a healthy dose of reality to the reader about what to expect (especially in the negative physical aspects). Along with those points it would have been nice to hear about all the beautiful parts of being pregnant as well."
4,The Girlfriends' guide to Pregnancy,The author gave a humorous and truthful account of being pregnant. A fun easy read.
4,Funny,"This book puts a humorous spin on preganancy. Read it as a way to get a few laughs when your dealing with all of the ""interesting"" pregnancy symptoms. A fun read with some useful information."
5,The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy,I don't know what book Shannon read but it wasn't this one. This was the book I was looking for when I was pregnant with my first and it wasn't yet published. It is not a book for someone who wants the details about fetal development and the birth process. There are hundreds of others for that. This book made me laugh more than any other. It helps to know that there are other moms-to-be that are going through the same thing from how strange my husband was acting to why I felt like a pod when I had wanted to be pregnant for so long before. I give this book to all of my expectant friends. The sequels are great too but this is the best.
1,"Great for laughs, not for facts.","This book belongs in the humor section, not where someonemight actually take it seriously. While the author doespoint out some of the humorous aspects of pregnancy and birthher general tone is that of negativity. This book is achildbirth educator's or midwife's nightmare, a doctor'sdream-come-true."
1,Full of falsehoods,This book has some light-hearted moments but it has more bad advice than good. The worst is the section on exercise. The final point she makes is that you shouldn't exercise because if there turns out to be a problem with your baby you will always wonder if it happened because you exercised during pregnancy! This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever read and there is absolutely no medical evidence to support such an outlandish claim. For this reason and other perpetuated myths I give this book one star.
2,Too negative,"I didn't read the whole book, skipping a few sections here and there but I did read a good part of it. I found this book disapointing. I thought she focused too much on all the negative parts of pregnancy. I do think it is good to know about the negative things too, but I left this book feeling bummed that pregnancy would leave me incontinent with a body that would never be remotely close to what it was (which did not prove to be completely true). I felt like I already knew about hemroids and all that crapy stuff already anyway, so I guess if you know absolutely nothing about pregnancy this book may be helpful. Just don't get too bummed because not EVERYTHING will happen to you."
3,It's bubble-gum reading,"This is great reading for someone who wants to commiserate and have a good chuckle, but it's definitely not a ""guide."" Women's pregnancy and birth experiences are so incredibly varied, it's pretty obnoxious to think that this ONE woman's experience should be a guide for the rest of us. For solid information about birth and the real choices you'll face, try ""A Thinking Woman's Guide to Better Birth"" by Henci Goer. It's based on medical evidence and helps you feel a lot smarter talking to your doctor/midwife about the decisions you have to make down the line."
2,Wish I hadn't bought it,"The author is totally self-centered and vain. She seems to be more concerned with looking good than taking good care of herself (and her baby). Don't go to the gym because you don't look good in your outfit?! Give me a break. Not everyone of us is a size 4 and wears tights and leotards. I feel sorry for her because her values seem way out of whack.All her girlfriends seem equally selfish. One gal wouldn't take pain medication because her husband was promising jewelry!? What a materialistic, brainless twit.Save your money."
1,Read this book if you want to be terrified!!!,"After reading this book I almost changed my mind about having children! It mainly focuses on negativity and the author gives you the impression that almost any horror of pregnancy is an inevitability. There are definite pros and cons to having an epidural, but Vicky makes it seem like your only intelligent choice is to have one. I would not recommend this book for a first time mom learning about pregnancy. I did not find this book amusing, nor did my husband."
3,Just okay,"I found myself skipping plenty of pages. Some parts were funny, some just lame, and some very dated. The book was just okay."
1,"Cute book, but definately anti-natural.","This book has some cute advice and is very funny in places.What I didn't like about it was how pro-traditional medicine it was. Like the reviewer Shannen below said, it is very one-sided and anti-natural anything. The witches-midwife comment really bothered me, as well as the comment that natural childbirth will make you ugly because it will break all the blood vessels in your face from straining so hard. I think the author is really off base.All in all, I would not recommend this book because it tried to make me feel like a freak about being a natural parent. There are a lot of options for pregnant women and epidurals aren't the only choice, as the author implies. I believe that women should make the best choice for them, not what the author spouts as gospel."
1,Really awful,"This book was a gift from a friend. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on it. It was very negative, very uninformative, and very superficial. I particularly disliked her attitude toward her husband. Not all husbands are like hers. Mine actually was helpful and rubbed my back every night of my last trimester. I also didn't like her advice on not exercising. She is not a doctor and shouldn't be giving out advice like that. It is important to stay healthy and fit so that you can actually get through the labor. Overall the book was a letdown and I am telling all of my girlfriends to not buy it. The best book I have found is by Glade Curtis. It goes week by week to let you know how you should be doing, how your baby is, and is based on actual science."
1,almost made me adopt,"I tried hard to appreciate the humor of this book- but beyond that, it didn't highlight a single positive thing about being pregnant- in fact it almost scared me out of it. I would not recommend this book to anyone who's considering or experiencing pregnancy for the first time- stay away!"
4,Fun and Entertaining!,"A lighthearted approach to motherhood. I thought it was a nice read and would recommend it to other expecting moms that want something entertaining and humorous to read about pregnancy, labor & delivery."
2,Just not for me,"I read so many great reviews about this book and was very excited but, I just felt the author was very pretentious. I don't know, I assume it's just me but, I did not like it at all!!Hearing about her ""supermodel"" friends and their pregnancies and all the name dropping drove me crazy! It's not an audition to be on the ""cool list."""
5,Feel Good Book,This book is a factual but hilarious view at the trials of pregnancy. I laughed through the entire book because she says exactly what I have been feeling. It is the first book I have bought that actually felt like someone understands!! I can't say enough about it - it is definately a must have for every pregnant woman.
5,Finding Humor in Pregnancy Pain,"I read this book twice and both times I laughed out loud! It is not meant to be informative, but rather funny. I did learn a lot, but it was the ""real"" stuff about pregnancy that you don't read in medical books. I HIGHLY recommend this book for all pregnant mothers looking for a good laugh and some girlfriend truths."
1,Vapid tips for the oblivious,"Not exactly ""The Thinking Women's Guide to Pregnancy,"" this vapid tome was the single worst and least helpful book we bought to educate ourselves on pregnancy. This book will not help you unless you view pregnancy as an unfortunate condition that needs to be coped with rather than embraced. And the ""coping with"" is make-up tips from the author-model. If you are at all into natural childbirth (and fall on the breastfeeding and cloth diaper sides of the issues) then this book will mostly just offend you. If, on the other hand, you think women who forego drugs are wacky leftists, then this book will help you feel good about being oblivious."
1,Very opinionated,"I put this book down on my third week of pregnancy. After reading a few pages, I noticed that most of the information did not relate to how I was experiencing my pregnancy. I tried to be objective and began to read it five weeks later and still could not relate to the information Ms. Iovine was telling women. Some of her statements are silly, childish and not reflective of what an adult would or should say to another adult. I would not even share her information with a teenager who is pregnant. Her recommendations can be found in other books that speak to its readers in a more intellectual voice. Others may rave about this book but I am not."
1,Depressing and thoughtless,"First of all, what form of low-life are these ""girlfriends"" married to? They all sound like refugees from the fifties with their thoughtless ways.Second of all, I have never found a more depressing book in my life. It makes assertions from, 'no, you and your husband will never find your body sexy again,' to ,'get a good male O.B. because that's the only male touch you will have in your last trimester because you will be just too unappealing'. The one or two laughs this book gave me is not enough to make me finish reading it. I prefer to feel as if my life has not ended."
2,this is humor?,"hey hey hey Girlfriend...! how supa cool are you! NOT. This book was so dumbed down it was embarrassing!! It also struck me as narcissistic. How strong are those maternal hormones anyway -- if you are just obsessed with how fat your ... gets or whether you are going to have gas. I found it to be just the market a shallow, mindless highschool cheerleader may be looking for. I, on the other hand, was much more interested in the development of the baby inside of me."
3,Confused,"I'm a first time mom-to-be and after reading this book, I was partially relieved to read the things which I was able to relate to but on the other hand confused from her sarcastic and cynical remarks such as husband bashing and the terrifying delivery stories.(hemorroids!!!) She seems to know what she is talking about, yet, I do agree with other readers how she did not have very many good things to say about pregnancy. Granted I am not having the most comfortable pregnancy right now, but I feel that every pain and discomfort that I go through is well worth it for our precious one!!! I'm not sure if I would recommend this book to my other girlfriends because I ceartainly don't want to be accused as hating pregnancy, cycnical or snobbish....."
5,The hardest I laughed in 40 weeks,I loved this book. Finally a book that wasn't so serious. The sarcasm in this book kept me laughing every time I picked it up. I still fish through it and my son is one and a half. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to really enjoy their pregnancy and laugh!
4,Great book,I enjoyed this book because of its straight talk and because it wasn't nearly as scary or confusing as some others. The only problem is that it isn't as informative as some.
5,Finally...some humor,"Loved this book.....I read so many that give you the straight facts. In a time when everything is scary and new, this book was light and fun to read and actually gave great advice. I share it with all my pregnant friends - it is a great pregnancy gift."
3,I Wanted to Throw Away this Book after Reading it Because...,"the information in this book doesn't apply to most people as it claims to and made me feel depressed that all I could do while pregnant was eat and get fat. The chapter about exercise is inaccurate and depressing to say the least. If you're a couch potato and plan to stay that way while pregnant than this is the book for you. If you're active and plan to live your life while pregnant DO NOT get this book. As my doctor told me everyone has a bad story about pregnancy and not to listen to them, my advice is the same for this book, it seams to be full of bad stories and experiences and shouldn't be bought."
1,Lame and somewhat condescending,"Who knew that you could be made to feel like an outsider when reading a book about pregnancy, written by someone who calls herself your girlfriend? Apparently, girlfriends wear leggings and say don't exercise, you can be sloppy for 9 months and have an excuse to gain. I pretty much despised this book because it told you what to think. If you want a good read that is straightforward and modern, read ""From the Hips"". Its great info written by 2 women with exerpts from many women as side notes, not as the main text."
1,Demeaning to women,"This book included very few facts on the true experience of pregnancy. It assumes that women are not strong enough to handle the most incredible life experience with grace and dignity. The ""medical"" advice is based upon the patriarchal medicalization of birth for the convenience of doctors.I recommend you pass on this book and find one that trusts women to be strong enough to celebrate the birth experience."
3,"Cute Read, But Not Worth Buying","I found this book funny and fresh, but I was disappointed that I actually bought this new. It would've been a better candidate for a library check out because it just makes you laugh and isn't used for reference. Even though I did enjoy reading it early in my pregnancy, I don't see myself going back and reading it again. A real eye-opener!"
1,The author gives the straight facts?,"Please. In what universe? I have yet to see her write a book that gives facts. It's ""The World According To Vicky,"" which, to my knowledge, is not yet the accepted world view of the World Health Organization -- which, by the way, would find most of her views on pregnancy and childbirth pretty darn UNHEALTHY."
5,I'm not even pregnant!!,"That's right, I'm not even trying but babies are on my mind! All my girlfriend's are and I plan to be within the next year so curiosity got the better of me a little early. I loved this book. It was very down to earth all the while being hysterical! The way she talks about throwing somthing at her husband more than once! She, to her best ability describes, from start to finish what the nine/ten months of pregnancy was like for her and a group of girlfriend's she's consulted. She explains this is not a medical book and that these are the things that the doctors don't tell you like the hemmoroids and uncontrollable flatulence! She just describes her 4 experiences or her girlfriend's in a way that always can make you smile or even laugh out loud! Very enjoyable and I definatley want to read it again when I actually am pregnant."
3,A fun read in comparison to other pregnancy books,"I liked this book for the light-hearted approach that it takes when looking at pregnancy. I don't feel that it prepared me any more or less for the 10 month stretch, than any other book. It was more fun to read than the heavy and very serious ""What to Expect"".I did enjoy the ""Girlfriends Guide to the First Year"" much better...lots of good, solid advice."
5,A must buy for expecting moms,"loved it so much bought it for a few of my expecting friends. a very laid back kind of book telling you things that the other books don't want to talk about. plus the author has a funny way of explaining things and her ""girlfriends"" had some funny stories as well."
1,Ugh!,"This book did nothing to make me feel empowered or capable while preparing for birth. I can see why some people might like this ""in your face"" approach to prenatal advice but it totally turned me off. Additionally, I think it is irresponsible to tell pregnant women not to exercise. If you believe you are capable of having a happy, healthy pregnancy, and are interested in natural childbirth at all, skip this book. It's depressing and (to someone newly pregnant) overwhelmingly negative!"
1,"Terrible Book, Do not purchase!","I am now 6 months pregnant but I ordered this book very early in my first trimester, at 5 weeks pregnant, along with the Mayo Clinic's Pregnancy book. What a difference!The Girlfriends Guide was no help at all, just the opinions of one lady, that frankly, sounds like a dum dum. Plus her kids are teens now, so this book is probably outdated, though she states this is an updated version of her original.First off, she thinks no exercise is the way to go. It may risk miscarraige, this scared the crap out of me. She says take up knitting, this is the time to be lazy.The advice about highlighting hair, and everything else, was inaccurate and just her opinion.I wish I didn't buy this what a rip off! Buy the Mayo book or what to expect when expecting, those books are at least helpful. I don't need someone to tell me that I will look fat in mirrors and blah blah blah, I am like, duh!!!!"
4,A good read for an expecting mom,"The only thing I don't like is that this book assumes you are a super prissy girl and is more geared toward the first time mom. It is pretty good though because it is written from a mom's point of view and not a doctor or professional. It gives some questionable advice like not exercising, but is a pretty cute read, as long as you take it as someone's opinion and not expert advice."
1,for fun only,"I bought the book for myself. It's fun to read - humorous and friendly. BUT frankly speaking, it's a joke comparing to other books I bought, such as the mayo clinic guide. This book has too many personal views instead of critical/scientific truth."
3,Not my cup of tea,"I found this book to be a little negative. I thought the negativity took away from any intended humor. I was also put off when she mentioned that she got some of her medical advice and statistics from the television show ""Grey's Anatomy."" I just didn't care for it. If you're looking for a humorous book about the reality of pregnancy try ""Belly Laughs"" by Jenny McCarthy."
5,Laugh out loud,"Every pregnant woman should have a copy of this book! I read it in just a few days and then shared it with all my pregnant friends. I laughed..I cried..it is a must have. I shared parts of it with my husband to ""prove"" to him that I couldn't be crazy if these same things I was experiencing were published in a book! It was reassuring to know that other women have gone through the same changes as myself. I highly recommend this book!"
1,Tops the list of books to avoid during pregnancy,"If you have any interest in drug-free childbirth, homebirth, avoiding a c-section,or simply being empowered to understand your choices during birth, please pass right on by this one. Her characterization of ""natural childbirth moms"" as looking exhausted and unattractive after birth as compared the the perky, well-rested ones who chose drugs is not only offensive, but seriously, VERY unrealistic. Also please avoid this if you are offended by a wealthy white woman assuming she understands your experience, and giving you disempowering advice because she's your ""girlfriend."" Yes, I have a strong opinion about this book."
2,"Should be called ""The Yuppies' Guide to Pregnancy""","If you are the kind of person who finds rehashing old male/female stereotypes, making fun of people who want the best for their child, and being obsessed with your looks funny, then I highly recommend this book.If she wrote this book specifically as humor, it would be less of a problem, but she writes this book to be taken at least somewhat seriously. She appears downright ignorant about the benefits of breastfeeding and natural childbirth, unaware of the fact that not all of us are a size 4 and live in Hollywood, and she is insulting to families and men (for example, when she makes statements like ""men who are involved in the pregnancy have too much time on their hands.""Check it out from the library if you're curious, but don't waste your money."
2,"Funny, but doesn't empower women at all!","I can't tell you how much I despised the content in this book. Yes, it is funny or I would have given it only one star, but funny does not make up for the fact that if does not help ease women's fear and anxiety about pregnancy and childbirth. It bascially tells you to go to the hospital ignorant of anything but what they tell you and get ready to get strapped to a monitor, be given pitocin, and have your water broken and then get a C-section because you ""failed to progress"". Women have a right to know their options. Iovine only recommends giving birth in a hospital. Why? Because you might not get all the interventions in a birthing center. Yes, there are no awards given out for natural childbirth, but maybe some women who ""fail"" because they had a c-section might have succeeded if they had educated themselves with another book and given their bodies a chance to do the work. Please don't make this your only pregnancy and childbirth reading."
2,"This book is funny, but not very helpful.","This book has a great sense of humor about pregnancy, but has some really stupid advice in it. I do not agree with the author that you should quit exercising during pregnancy. Her theory is that you are going to get fat anyhow so why bother exercising. Exercise during pregnancy can help alleviate some of the more nasty symptoms, like one of the author's favorites... Hemorrhoids. This is not a good book for people who are going to take the author's advise seriously. It is also not a book for anyone who is thinking about natural, unmedicated childbirth. It is perfect for the always on a diet, can't live without hair dye set though..."
1,what a sad approach to exercise (and to your own body),"I have to admit, I read only a couple of lines in a book store and that was quite enough. About the question of excercise the advice was basicall: ""Dont do it, when something bad happens you will blame yourself for the rest of your life and you won't look good in a tight sports outfit anyway. Just enjoy the time you don't have to excercise."" So, I conclude from that: Women excercise only to LOOK good in and out the gym? What about excercising for FEELING good, energetic not to talk about that it might be healthy? We do everything just for the looks? What a sad statement the author made about herself with just these few lines. I can't say anything about the rest of the book, but I hope it has more sense."
5,Relatable with just the right amount of humor,"This book did not make me feel like I was killing my baby at every turn. It was an honest take on pregnancy from a normal gal. I found her chapters funny, and relatable. I appreciate that she did not try to make blanket statements, nor did she try to be an expert in pregnancy and advice. I felt better about myself after reading this, knowing that there are millions of women the world over who are feeling the same mixed set of emotions I am. I am so appreciative of this book that I will be purchasing it for all of my girlfriends who are expecting."
5,"A Fun, Light, Educational, Read","Compared to some of the more detailed and serious mom-to-be books out there, this is a breath of fresh air for your nightstand. Having read several books by medical professionals and others that go into detail about the birth process and the ways you are changing, this is just juicy, light-hearted fun. This book offers the human perspective (a sassy one at that) of the pregnancy and birth process. I really enjoyed it."
4,A great emotional supplement with pregnancy guides.,"I lived away from my mother, aunts, and girlfriends while I was pregnant. I read a couple ""technical"" books with great information, but started reading this in my third month, when I started to feel like I was going a little crazy - this book helped to put humor into my pregnancy, and I relaxed a lot more (my husband loved it too). I recommend it as an ""extra"" book to read accompanied by 2 or 3 great pregnancy guides."
3,Know what you're in for if you order this book....,"I made the mistake of assuming that this book was a useful source of information about pregnancy. It's not. It's the pregnancy world's equivalent of a trashy novel: a fun read, but certainly not any food for the brain! As long as you supplement the rather insipid advice of this none-too-bright girlfriend with a pregnancy book that weighs in with a lot of factual information (I recommend The Unofficial Guide to Having A Baby; The Pregnancy Book; or What To Expect When You're Expecting Twins, Triplets, or Quads, depending on how many babies you're carrying), you'll be fine. But, whatever you do, don't make The Girlfriend's Guide the only book you read to prepare you for pregnancy and birth! Otherwise, you'll think that stretch marks are the worst thing that can happen to you. :-)"
2,Not realistic to my life!,I found her completely old-fashioned in the way she described how husbands to be acted. I thought this was geared towards older mothers to be. I am 24 and could hardly relate to a lot of her topics. The exercise philosophy is crap and could scare a lot of women unnecessarily. Nearly everything that I've read encourages women to keep up their exercise routine for as long as they feel comfortable. This book is garbage.
5,Honest & hilarious,"This book was recommended by a friend and it is a wonderfully honest look at pregnancy with lots of laughs. The technical guides have their place but nothing beats your girlfriends knowledge & trials to put your mind at ease. Especially great for us ""mature"" first time moms."
3,Entertaining,"I enjoyed flipping through this book but did not read it all, page by page, because some subjects were just too long and overly informative."
3,"good book, but a little scary","this book will give the 1st time Mom alot of info, but it can freak you out a bit with details of ""bad events"" and things that can mess your kid up."
1,The Guide to Things your no one should tell you,I have never felt the urge to write a negative review for a book until this book was passed along to me yesterday. My girlfriend and I sat around for an entire hour laughing at the contents of this book. This is the most condescending book on pregnancy that I've seen. I feel sorry for any woman who reads this book and takes it seriously.
1,Full of it.,"I had hoped this would provide a little lighthearted humor, but instead it just made me all too aware how shallow the author and her ""Girlfriends"" must be. She is full of opinions, herself and not much else."
1,HORRIBLE Book,"This is one of the WORST books for expectant mothers to read. Not only does it portray birthing, nursing and a mother's right to advocate for herself during labor and delivery as negative, it provides misinformation.As a birth educator, labor doula and mom, I HIGHLY discourage reading this book to anyone interested in obtaining objective, evidenced-based birthing and postpartum information.Stick to Sheila Kitzinger, Dr. Sears and Penny Armstrong (to name a few) as strong birth education authors. All of these will provide a thorough, evidence-based approach."
1,Out of date and not applicable,"I got this book reluctantly on advice from my doctor and couldn't stand it. I'm surprised that I'm in the minority here. I thought the idea behind the book was good, but by being from a ""girlfriend"" perspective, it assumes that have the same lifestyle as the author, which I obviously don't. If you live in Malibu, are friends of actresses, and care about things like bikini waxes and pedicures, then this book is for you. If not, skip it. It's also out of date, with a whole chapter devoted to pregnancy fashion a'la stirrup pants and leggings with big sweaters. I also found myself feeling sorry for Vicki, who has such a deadbeat husband when it comes to pregnancy. After a while the sexist assumptions and ""girlfriend"" attitude really got to me."
4,Like other have said NOT a reference book!,"This book is NOT written by a Dr and is not meant to be anything other than a VERY VERY candid and humorous look at pregnancy. It will tell you things that you didn't even think would happen to your body and things you wouldn't even ask your Dr. Like others have said there is a sense of ""I'll never be a size 4 again"" to this book which is hard to understand if (like I) you were never even close to a size 4 in your life but if you can get past that it is great. This book is just what it sounds like a mother writing about the things that only you and you closest girlfriends talk about! It is a very funny and revealing look at what really happens to you. If you want to have a good laugh get this book."
5,This book is a welcome shot of Common Sense,"After reading some of the more alarmist books out there, including ""the bible of expectant mothers"", which shall remain nameless, I found Ms. Iovine's book a breath of fresh air.I even gave this book to my OB when she found out she was pregnant. And she liked it! I too am tired of the ""pregnancy Nazis"" who are ready to jump all over a pregnant woman and criticise her every move. Sure, Vicky is rich and skinny, and I am neither, but nor am I jealous! I did lose my baby fat with my first baby, even without a personal trainer and a live in nanny. Granted, it would have been easier with both of those.The point is, just about every thing that she said could happen in the book, did happen. If that is being negative, then so be it. I highly recommend this book."
4,Funny and calming,"This book was great. The author was really funny but at the same time she was very informative. Whenever I was afraid that something bad or strange was happening to me, this book calmed me right down. The only criticism I can give it is that it's not organized in the best way. I would have liked to see it as more of a month by month book."
5,A Must on your Pregnancy Reading List!,"What a great book! As the title indicates it tells you all those little things the Doctor ""forgets"" to tell you and you are probably too embarrassed to ask. I would not call this a reference book (for that purpose I would recommend the Sears pregnancy book) but it is wonderful in addition to one. This will definitely cover most things and make you feel good about them and about yourself. Ms. Iovine has a great sense of humor. This book will just make you laugh out loud - especially when you come across a perfect description of something you are just experiencing. I tell all my friends who are pregnant to get this book. I loved it and read it two or three times during my pregnancy!"
5,the great cheer me up book!!!,"How can anybody feel this book is negative? this is the most wonderfull book to take anywhere, I took it to my doctors appointments and read it while i waited cause it makes me feel more relax. It's True this is not a medical book, but belive me i have read around 20 pregnancy books (because i really like reading and the subject) and this is the book and giving to my Girlfriends. you have lots of worries in the day, this book is to make you feel free to be a little (ok a lot) sensitive, crazy and silly. I also recomend her other books."
1,stay away from this one if you're looking for the facts of pregnancy,"This book was condescending in it's tone - ""Don't worry your pretty little head about it! Get a c-section, it's easier to schedule your birth!""A c-section is MAJOR ABDOMINAL SURGERY, and should never be discussed as an option for anyone unless there is a medical indication.It also included such gems as ""dressing up for your Obstetrician, even when you don't care what your husband thinks of you anymore"", and the ""watermelon diet"".Stay away from this one if you're looking for factual information on pregnancy and childbirth."
3,Too vague and a bit paranoid,"Of the 5 baby-preparation books I've been loaned by friends during my pregnancy, this is the least useful. I was frustrated by its lack of specificity (why NOT mountain biking? why should I eat fish?) and its borderline bad advice at time. The section on pregnancy and exercise was horrifying- they seem to be condoning not exercising because you might get freaked out that you are hurting the baby. Nonsense! Terrible advice!The only good things about this guide are that it covers a lot of ground in easily read language. That might be good for a mom who just wants to know the super basics. But as someone who wants to know not just what to do and not do, but why I should or should not do these things, I have stopped reading this one entirely."
5,Fun book,This book - along with her others - are just fun to read.My husband even enjoyed reading it.There were many good ideas and funny stories.
5,HILARIOUS outlook on pregnancy!,"This book was given to me by a friend.It was soooo funny! It's so ""matter of fact"" about your pregnancy. She tells you whats going to happen without tippy toeing around the facts. Just says it like it is!I bet the author would be one of the funnest people to know!I highly recommend this book, and intend to buy it for pregnant friends in the future."
2,More than you need to know...,"I thought this book sounded like what I needed to hear. Well, I'm 6 1/2 months pregnant, and I got freaked out by most of the stuff in this book. Granted, I had an awful first 4 1/2 months of pregnancy, so perhaps I wasn't in the best frame of mind. However, reading about things that can happen during pregnancy and childbirth that are just horrible does no one any good. Sure, you could say, ""I want to be prepared for everything,"" well, I'm sure this is not possible. I had nightmares after reading this book. I know Vicki, you had the best of intentions, but it was just too much info for me..."
5,Informative and amusing. I laughed out loud!,"This is a wonderful book on the experience of pregnancy, from the mother-to-be's viewpoint.It bashes myths with gleeful abandon, while imparting a full body of knowledge about this glorious but confusing time of our lives.This is one book that is genuinely fun to read. I laughed out loud throughout each delightful chapter.(Peggy Dorf,Vancouver, WA)"
5,Finally!!! I Love This Book!!!,"I think that I've probably read all the recomended stuff.All the factual,common,bland,doctor stuff. Now I havefinally found a book that does not scare you intosubmission! Vicki gives just enough humor to make a scary,and somewhat akward, period in a womans life, so muchmore enjoyable. Her insight and experience is greatlyappreciated and sorely needed. I'm recomending it to allmy friends! Thanks Vicki!!"
5,"A great antidote to all those ""serious"" pregnancy books","This book is the only one I've found that actually sounds like it's written by someone I might be friends with. It's the perfect book to pick up when you're tired of all those ""pregnancy is the most beautiful, precious, spiritual, etc. etc. time of your life"" books and you're just feeling fat, tired, and hormonal. This book reassured me I wasn't a ""bad mother"" for acknowlodging these feeling. Iovine made me laugh and gave some very practical advice that doctor's never seem to mention"
1,If you want to read a negative book-- this one's for you!,"This book is full of such helpfull advice as: you'll never lose the weight while you're breast-feeding, you'll have excess skin, gain weight all over your body and will need at least 9 months to lose it! This obsession with body changes and inability to lose weight may stem from the fact that the author is a size 4 and 1 extra pound seems like 10 to her. Not only is this book depressing, it does not accurately reflect a normal pregnancy. The author lists countless symptoms and insists that these same symptoms occured to all her girlfriends. Let me tell you-- you might experience half of those! I wonder why the author chose to have 4 children in 6 years (NO KIDDING the rhythm method didn't work for her!)She certainly didn't cherish the pregnancies! Clearly I'm a minority opinion here, but I don't know what other readers found humorous about this book."
2,"for ""cute"" little Moms","While I found parts of this book humerous, I didn't really find it informative. It assumes that you are a well off, married, and thin. The comments on maternity clothes implied that any normal women could get by wearing a few fat clothes (size 10, for many of us size 10 is a REALLY good day) and her husbands clothes until she' ready for real maternity outfits. Although I'm not sure that I can handle a completely natural birth, she ridicules anyone who thinks they might like to try it.In short, her many of her experiences and advice simply do not apply to me or my life."
1,Would never recommend,"This book starts off funny but quickly the author gives many of her own opinions which are contrary to what any Dr will tell you not to mention a bit out of date. She suggests having an alcoholic drink now and then and she encourages to not bother to excersise. It is just like listening to your girlfriend who has a major complex about weight and has a non supportive husband. It gets old fast and not to mention a bit depressing. At the half way point I had to stop reading, I had had enough."
2,"funny for a few minutes, but this gets old","I was expecting too much from this book. I wanted either a good laugh or some tangible, valuable information: I got very little of either. Everything I read, from stretch marks to fashion ideas, I had already read somewhere else or heard before from my own friends. The humor--albeit funny for a few pages--got old for me; lots of ""pregnancy guarantees gas"" and ""you'll look fat with short hair"" jokes. I thought her rationale for not exercising was ambitious though she left out the benefits of light exercise. I also know so many women who get their figures back in far less than nine months. Other than that, the material pretty much covers the obvious, and I sort of felt like I'd been duped. Like when we all bought pet rocks. What were we thinking?"
3,"Disappointing! Sometimes funny, but often obnoxious","This book started out funny and I was enjoying it in the beginning, but I found it more iritating the more I read! The author's comments and attitude at times seemed annoying, obnoxious, and sometimes even offensive. Her diatribe was too self-centered, ethnocentric, and flighty for my taste! Don't waste your money! Get a different book, instead."
1,Most Offensive Pregnancy Book I've Read,"Ok, so I admit upfront that I only made it halfway through the book before I was so irritated and offended that I couldn't go on. Morbid curiosity got me that far and would take me no further. The author states numerous times that her husband didn't find her attractive in later pregnancy. Fine. Then she went on to state that she kept coloring her hair throughout pregnancy because her husband would've divorced her otherwise. Presumably, she was joking. Nevertheless, the entire book took this tone. One woman mentioned made sure to paint her toenails before going to the OB so that when her feet were in the stirrups, they would look pretty. How flipping shallow. The book got worse and worse until I couldn't take it anymore."
1,What to expect if you have no self esteem and view pregnancy as a burden,"After reading this book as a newly-pregnant woman, I decided that I would view my pregnancy and body in the exact opposite terms of this author. So far, so good. The ten point list on the inner cover tells you everything you need to know. The idea is that pregnancy is painful, disgusting, depressing, fattening, sex-ruining, and uglifying both during and after. And that about covers the whole message of the book. One of the only blessings she says you have to glean is ""a visit from the titty fairy"". How crass! My boyfriend still jokingly says that to me now! If you are a thinking woman, do what I did and stay away from this book, and keep having sex and feeling beautiful. Don't take the lowest common denominator route and pay attention to drivel like this.PS, I'm still pg, but I read another review in which the reviewer also ignored the book and has an awesome, fit body after pregnancy!"
1,Not for the biologist.....,"""The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy"" is good for kicks-sort of like slapstick comedy. It does lack biology and medical facts and is mostly based upon the author's opinion. If you want a light fun read, then this may something for you. My personality and the relationships that I have with my husband and friends are quite different than Vicki's, so I could not relate with most of what she wrote about. It is not a horrible book, but if you want factual information then this book is not for you."
3,"Humorous look at something most woman go through, however...","...most women aren't a size 4 nor do they have friends with cutesy names like Corki. Also, if you have any issues with your weight (and what normal sized (size 10 and up) woman doesn't? Thank you, Cosmo :P) you may be offended when the author rambles on about how she got so FAT at a size 10! If you can get past that, though, the book is helpful and does tell you things you probably won't hear from your doctor unless you know to ask ;)"
5,Why puke when you can laugh?,"This being my second pregnancy, I was aware of a few things already that noone wants to tell you. This being my reasoning for buying this book ( along with the fact that I am still a young woman and the other books on pregnancy out are sooooo serious and technical that it almost makes pregnancy seem like a chore ). Anyway, I laughred out loud throughout the whole book, which was unusual for me since Ive had morning sickness 24-7 forever. Anyway, this book is right on. I felt like I was reading a book about me. I HIGHLY recommend this for any woman who looks at pregnancy as a fun experience and is wanting to keep her pre-pregnancy sense of humor!"
4,Cute but scary if taken too seriously,"I thought the book was a hoot - she is very clever with her words. However, it is obvious some of it is written purely for the humor. Some of her advice, if written in a text book format and not in a humorous, conversational format, would be down right scary! One thing that points to this is her somewhat cavalier attitude about weight gain - chocolate chip cookies and milk every night under the pretense of getting your calcium?! Yikes. No wonder she got 'fat'.All in all, a cute, easy read for those first weeks where you just want to know everything you can. Beware of taking things like the 'upholstered body' too seriously. It is meant to be funny!"
2,silly silly silly- and not very helpful,"not a very good book. Maybe good for a fourth time mother-to-be to read but too many women may think the author knows what she's talking about. She doesn't; even if she is amusing.sure- those of us who believe in ""natural birth"" don't like it, but we have good reasons for not wanting to be messed with while pregnant, giving birth or learning to breastfeed. We need facts, not frivolity."
2,Only if you have time - doesn't have the info you need,"This is a tongue-in-cheek flush piece, not something full of information, as my wife and I had expected. She didn't consider it helpful."
2,"Good for laughs, not for advice","It is a funny book that puts forth the author's opinion. Sometimes this opinion is exactly the opposite of what the doctor recoomends. So, please be wary !"
1,Not as good as I thought it would be,While it is funny. I didn't learn anything I didn't learn about my pregnancy or what was happening with my body. I had to buy another book for this.
1,A Girlfriend's Guide to a Miserable Pregnancy,"Becoming pregnant was one of the greatest joys of my life, but this author makes pregnancy sound like a huge mistake. She is extremely cynical about every aspect of pregnancy, and gives advice that very few women could use. She spends much time male bashing and degrading fathers. She teaches women to be self centered, worrying only about themselves and not their husbands or their baby. I truly feel sorry for the women who agree with this author, for they are missing out on the joys the baby brings and the love and expectations that a husband and wife can share."
2,Disney Princess Party Tiaras,"These were disappointing. After I got the picture of all the girls wearing them they never put them back on. Anyway, the tiaras did o.k. but I wouldn't buy them again. They aren't even very pretty to look at - like your kid is wearing an aluminum pie-pan strip with a little piece of red and gray cardboard attached to it. The stickers were lame too. At least they could have made those shiny/glittery to jazz up the tiaras."
5,WOW!,"Great cd! i love the song ""they're not gonna get us"" it makes me want to dance. Has a great sound effect and makes you listen to it over and over! COOL!"
5,best cd by any gurl group,i just heard this cd in its the best cd ever i mean all the songs/ beats /lyrics are good you see i know russin so i understand the lyrics but still t.a.t.u are the best in i know there gonna be here for a long time to come so to everyone who reads this go get the cd NOW !
2,Hedy Lamar,"Mediocre, but rather interesting bio on Hedy Lamar. It was disappointing that her interest and achievements in electronics was never discussed. She was a brilliant woman."
3,I like my Sigg,"Apparently I have a kids one?! Anyway, I love the design (whispering meadows) and that they are toxin free, can hold many different types of beverages, and sturdy. It's very easy to clean with a bottle brush. My baby won't drink water out of a sippy cup or her bottle, but she loves my water bottle!*revised down a star because the company had been misleading about BPA* Still like the bottle and they switched mine out to a new one, no questions asked."
1,Vert Disappointed,I bought countless sigg bottles for my kids over the last 8 years. I spent the extra money for their safety. Then I find out that the bottles are not safe and the company lied. Never will I buy from or trust this company again. I cringe at the thousands of times I filled these bottles and gave them to all my kids. By the way Whole foods market will take back all recalled Sigg bottles and give you store credit. No receipt required.
1,This proves good marketing & eye-candy really sell,A bottle that has no insulation. A bottle which opening is so small that cleaning thoroughly isn't possible. What are you people smoking?! The flowery patterns are really THAT attractive? Swiss-made really sounds THAT impressive? Have you heard of stickers? Recreate those pretty patterns on any bottle if patterns matter to you that much. This totally-flawed product shouldn't be on the market after 1950s...
3,"Better than plastic, but still has it's flaws","We bought a Sigg bottle and a similar one made by Thermos for our child. I like the spout of the sigg bottle better than the built in straw in the Thermos bottle. However, the Sigg bottle conducts the temperatures through to the outside of the bottle (the Thermos one does not). Thus, if we fill it with ice water, the bottle is freezing cold to hold and 'sweats'. If filled with a hot drink the bottle gets hot to the touch. The Thermos bottle seems to have a level of insulation between the inner wall and the outside of the bottle- thus making it much more comfortable for a child to work with. Also, our child had a little trouble with the twisting open/shut of the spout on this bottle and tended to just leave it open, which does lead to leaking....."
3,Not so great,"I guess I'll be the ""Debby Downer"" on this product. In theory, this water bottle is great. But in practicality - not so much. Maybe mine was not put together properly. I got my son a kid water bottle (not cheap by the way) and on the first outing to the park he dropped it on the foamy cushy floor and the lid broke off. I wish you good luck with this product if you get it but know not to let it fall to the ground."
3,"Sigg - Like it, don't love it...","We generally are happy with our Sigg bottles, however, the bottles are not insulated, so if you put something cold in them, the bottle becomes very cold to the touch. My kids often complain about this. We have other stainless steel bottles that are insulated on the outside that the kids definately prefer. Also, the opening of the Sigg bottles is very small which makes it difficult to clean thoroughly."
2,Could be made better,"The bottle looks nice when new. After sometime the paint peels off. Also the mouth of the bottle will have some build up and discoloring. Please check the images i have uploaded .The cap is also very intricate and you have to spend at least 20 minutes to clean the cap. I bought over 6 bottles directly from SIGG but very much disappointed. For the price i paid , i feel that the product does not worth it. May be look for a stainless steel canteen"
3,Bought this for the neighbor's kids when they come over.,"this unit was on sale, and it's for kids. Our neighbor's girls did not like Dora at all, but they still played with it. Go figure...kids. I find the graphics on the unit ""ok"" for the price. A game boy it's not. it's part interactive and part movie. It'll keep kids occupied while parents talk/chat...It's served it's purpose and the girls always go straight to the system now (but now they chose Xgames or whatever it is)."
3,"Beware, Cant hold much weight","I used this V-Clamp to mount a Speedlite flash on a flash bracket clamped to a tripod collar. It would be OK staying still but I have to move around getting pictures at night clubs. The plastic mount on this clamp only has a thin square male end that is raised about a 1/16"" that fits inside the female square in the metal clamp. The plastic part rounded off so it freely spins now making it useless. Beware, Cant hold much weight."
4,Great Bag,"Nice large bag, kinda floppy unless you fill the front pockets so that the velcro adheres. Too thin for a laptop, but great for the stuff I carry, travel mug, thermos, lunch, extra clothes, books. Comfortable to carry."
5,Charles In Charge !!,"I love Charles Lloyd on ECM !! I have many of his ECM discs... As with many of my favorite artists, I keep a lookout for new releases,so I have been waiting for this one to come out .. I missed his concert with this Trio in Boulder Co last fall... I was working (unfortunately) I bought this on the day of release , and it's been in my player since .. This,according to the liner notes, was their first gig together , which makes it absolutely more amazing ..It was recorded live in 2004.The Tabla talent of Zakir Hussein, Son of the Master, Alla Rakha (forgive spelling)and the tasteful drums of one Eric Harland , push Charles into overdrive , adventurous stuff!! Open your ears , this is a wonderful CD .. the best iv'e heard so far this year(2006) from ANYONE . right on Charles,Zakir and Eric- congrats Charles on your first live release on the fantastic ECM label ."
5,"Sangam is a Work of Astounding Beauty, Sound and Love","Transcendent, sublime and ecstatically wonderful - Sangam should be included on any and all lists of Best Jazz recordings of 2006. Recorded Live in Santa Barbara, Sangam features the incomparable Charles Lloyd on sax, tarogato, flute and piano, Tabla Master Zakir Hussain and Eric Harland on drums and percussion.I was fortunate to see these Three Masters live at the Boulder Theater in the Fall of 2005. They revealed a joyous empathy and amazing interplay that was off the charts - easily one of the best jazz concerts I've ever attended.On Sangam Master Lloyd is a whirling dervish, able to rip and lament while creating and holding the center still point. Hussain and Harland are mind blowing. Six panels of liner notes compliment the 75 minutes of Sonic Sublimity.Highly recommended - also see the excellent reveiw by Thom Jurek at All Music Guide."
5,Direct Jazz Transmission fron the masters,"Listening to Charles Lloyd is hearing a direct transmission from the masters of Jazz that Lloyd studied under and worked with.The list is too long to mention but to name but a few Oscar Peterson,Joe Zowenall,Tony Williams,Herbie Hancock,Keith Jarett,Jack DeJonette.The list goes on and on.Other than seeing Jimi Hendrix.I have never felt such an atmosphere of a true musical genius.His comand of time is astonishing as he works with Zakir Hussain on tabla and Eric Harland on drums.When you first see them on stage they look quite stark but from this trio completely based on the formation of a cosmic rythmn section flows a symphony of the freeist and most beautifully harmonic music I have ever heard.Charles Lloyd reminds us of the basis of Jazz and this free musical tradition, that he came from. That the ""beat"" is the alchemy and the very soul of this profound music."
3,Good tips on lighting but too short,"This is a good video to give you the basics of three point lighting and has a few tips on using diffusers and gels. However, it is really short (only 30 minutes long) and the graphics and music are SUPER CHEESY!!!! I guess I'm glad I bought this, but wish it could have been more comprehensive."
4,"A good read....Love, Hate, Tragedy, Triumph...but WHERE'S 2","I don't know if its the author or the publisher, but after getting very involved in the story of Saturna, her parents and her 2 cultures, you're left wanting more, a lot more. The story is good with a slight Star Trek overtone. Ace-Putnam needs to get on the stick and get Lt. Uhura to do some communicating."
5,Where is part 2,I loved Saturns child. It is one of the best books I have read in years and I am a big scifi/fantasy reader. The only thing I really have to say about it is WHERE IS THE SEQUEL??
4,"Great book, very interesting premise. When's the sequel?",I find this subject endlessly fascinating. The possibilitiesare infinite. The approach that Ms. Nichols has taken is veryromantic and I await the sequel with great anticipation. Herdescriptions of the characters is very visual and the imaginationcan run rampant. Thank you for a most enjoyable book.
4,left me wanting a sequel,"I admit to being a Trekie, so I was predisposed to like the book. That said, however, it really was engaging, and I found it different enough from Trek to make it both a credible story, and worth the read. In addition to the ""sci-fi"" component, there's also some romantic tension, for those are interested in that angle. The ending left me wanting more.....will there be a sequel?"
3,The Diabetic Bible,I so not eat most of the recipes in this book. Just the recipe or recipes that sounded good to me.
5,Double Vision in Carnival,"The ""double vision"" of Caribbean life is portrayed in the life of Aldrick who is caught between generational and cultural conflicts. And all of this during Carnival! The Dragon Can't Dance was almost prophetic in the depiction of the commercialization of Mas. Change always brings choice and Lovelace's characters highlight the necessary pain that comes with any decision."
1,Product Does Not Match Dexcription,The item I received does not match the image and description shown. I ordered a complete Bosch Oil Filter according to the image and description and only received the inside of the Bosch oil filter.
3,Kodaly Is The Funky Drummer,"Replay value is high--I've spent hours with just the first track and it never gets old. This is one of the most exhilirating orchestral performances I have in my collection, and I highly recommend it."
2,Not A Beginner's Book,"I am afraid that I must agree with the other reviewers. This book had the potential to be a decent reference, but the information is choppy...the ""will be covered in a later chapter"" stuff will drive you crazy trying to track down all you need to accomplish simple tasks. There are better books out there."
2,There are better ways to spend your money,"Go to the movies, or read on of the following (in this order): Peter Meyer (Getting started in computer consulting) Rick Freedman (The computer consultant) Gerald M Weinberg (The secrets of consulting) Enough said."
2,Pretty well not the best,"This book is not the best on the subject, I was a little upset about this purchase. Through out the book he makes these comments ""..we'll discuss this more in chapter X"" or "" ...like we said in chapter X"" I count 143 lines of these and gave up, it became aggravating and I stopped reading the book."
1,Rip off!!!!,"This is for 1 box of altoids on 12!!!!!!!!!! Horrible deal!!!!Returning mine, I can get these on sale at Walgreens for .99 cents a box!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,RIP OFF Not Flambeau Plastics USA - Chinese Flambeau Trading Co,"The product is advertisted as a Flambeau Plastics ""Outdoors 3003 Tuff Tainer"". What I recevied was a Chinese Flambeau Trading Co rip off. It was stamped mad in China and was not the right configuration of dividers. THE ONLY REASON I'M RATING THIS AS ONE STAR, THERE IS NOTHING LOWER. Amazon should delete this company from their web site."
5,Great read,I love Lori Handeland and she writes such great stories. This book included. I have all her books and variety is her best quality.
4,Enjoyed it immensely,Great story about the mistakes of youth and secrets that can tear families and relationships apart. I especially enjoyed the interactions between the different people because they seemed realistic. I am actually looking forward to reading the brothers stories.
5,really good story,"This was a good story. Not the usual light, funny story. It had a very serious secret that was destroying two people. And you had her family, lots of everyday problems to work thru. It was a very serious theme but I got so into it that I read until 2 a.m. to finish it. I highly recommend it. A very good read. And a HEA. Oh!! You will love the black sheep, Ba!!!"
3,It was ok,The plot was ok. I felt that it was following the same format in most romamces. I would recommend it if you want a light read.
5,THE FARMERS WIFE,Loved it !!!! It kept my interest all through the whole book. I will read more of her books in the future.
1,stars and stripes the wave,"The ad said new in box. The box was messed up, the flag motor is louder than the music, came with dead batteries and the box had a sticker price on it that looks exactly like a wal-mart clearance price tag and was marked $ 19.98. I paid more than $64.00. Looks like I am a fool but now smart enough to stay away from Amazon.com. I could not find any customer service numbers to call and complain so I threw this item away."
1,how in the world....?!?,"This is the only book I have given a 1 star rating for. I borrowed this book from the library for my son (thank God I didn't BUY it!) and was horrified to discover all the mistakes in it. And it's from a reputable publisher too. How the author could have made the mistakes that he did in writing this book is beyond me. Surely most of the info he needed for this is given on the Air Force Web pages. From the moment my son opened the book, I found myself explaining that there ARE women fighter pilots and that the air force base in Virginia is Langley, not Largely (?!?!). How many other errors there are, I do not know, but those two alone were enough to bias me against the book. I see another reviewer found quite a few more. I guess if we want to find out more about the Air Force, we should just check out their web site. DON'T buy this book!"
1,Mower and Motor are both garbage,"After 80 hours, the poorly designed air filter leaked and the motor ingested dirt and eventually failed.Google Briggs Intek failure, there are two primary reasons for this motor to fail. The first is the air filter doesn't seal properly even with proper maintenance.The newer models have been redesigned with an oval filter instead of the bad accordion filters. The second reason this motor fails is when used on inclines, the number one pistonget's starved for oil.The deck, I have had several spindle mandrel breakages and bearing failures due to unsealed bearings. About every use of the mower, I had to replace some broken part until it completelyfailed at 80 hours.Get a different brand mower and motor."
1,Very Dissapointed In Husqvarna YTH2348,After 3 hours of use I had to remove the deck to remove an obstruction. While doing so I observed a very poor bearing design on on each of the three blade mandrels. The ball bearings are not designed to be dust free. I am sure I will have to replace soon. I am considering returning back to Lowes and buying a real like the cub cadet 2500 series mower.I cannot believe the other review that rated this 5 stars was an actual consumer.
4,No Real Problems,"I've had this for 2 seasons, but I am a trucker so I don't get out to mow every week like most might. I just replaced the blades with mulch blades (Something to consider before getting it home), but other than that it's worked great and has one hell of a lot of power. Now if only I could find a reason to use it at night so I could give those head lights a try..."
4,Most Interesting,"When I read the excerpt, I was hooked. I enjoyed the story and the characters were well developed. This book really helped me in terms of putting into perspective how a person can get caught out there. I would definitely recommend Pipe Dreams and I hope to see more of Solomon Jones."
4,Great Job,"Crack addicts are accused of a murder they did not commit. Now they have committed many crimes, but none of them is capable of murder, according to their police profiles and the testimony of their families. That's a pretty good premise for a story--a crack addict as a hero--and it keeps the pages turning as they are pursued by cops and they learn to depend on each other for their mutual protection. Trust me, you have never read anything like this book. The scenes involving crack smoking are excellent, instructive, and insightful. The only problems is that the writer bit off more than he could chew with the police corruption plot, and he was not able to resolve it effectively with the conclusion he gave us."
5,Entertained and Educated,"Big Ups to Solomon Jones and to Strivers Row for publishing such a wonderful, intriguing, sad but entertaining story. I was once again captivated by a new writer's debut novel. It seems the Writers Renaissance has start anew. Jones tells a story, only most of us have heard of, and find it very hard to speak of and he tells it without preaching to the choir. I can't wait for his next novel, and Striver's Row new debut. I've already picked up the first three novels from them and I haven't thus far been disappointed. To Jones, keep up the good work."
1,Definitely --A Pipe Dream!,"I was unable to finish this poorly written first attempt at a novel. The characters were thin and stereotypical; I had no desire to find out what would happen to any of them. After only 3-4 chapters I called it quits. I doubt that I missed anything in the remaining chapters. The story of crack addicts and the ravishing effects of crack is a story should be told but ""Pipe Dream"" is not the vehicle for this message."
1,I did not like it,"I could not get into it and I found myself not feeling sympathetic for the druggies. I am in the minority I know, but this is how I feel."
5,not like all the rest,"this is a urban mystery that was so good that i wish i had read earlier, sorry that i have waited so long to start reading this authors work i have 3 other of his novel that i will start reading soon this is street literature at its best this is not your regular urban story this book will have you turning pages to see if the 4 people make it out alive. this is a must read for those of you that like suspene on the edge of your seat story"
3,50/50 Chance,"I have celiac and I really miss my candy, especially twist. I tried this product three times now and 1/3 times they were fresh. I don't know why 2/3 times they some of them were hard. And trust me I don't waste in finishing them once I get them. I wish the owner would do a better job in quality control. Overall they are a good product and really quick shipping."
1,Not worth the price or the calories,"I was delighted to find wheat free licorice on Amazon and ordered 3 kinds - the black and the raspberry from Candy Tree and a black licorice from another company. The Candy Tree licorice is terrible. The raspberry tastes vaguely like almost flavorless jam. Unfortunately, nobody in the family liked it, so this ended up in the trash."
4,It is a keeper!,"I was about to list this lens for sale here on Amazon, but then I started reading the reviews and remembering that this lens does what it is supposed to do. As one of the few prime lens that I own, this one is tack sharp, fast, compact, and in a tight spot--I can get everything. Even my feet!The review that really turned me around was from J.best""takeahack"". The fisheye look is not for every photo. And he is right. Changed my mind. I'm keeping my fisheye and I'll sell the MC-36 and the LensBaby.BTW, please please protect that front lens element. Remember we can't use a protective filter on this leans. I use it. Clean it if needed, and put it in its pouch. That is why I give the lens a four ( wish I could do a 4.5 or better). It is a great piece of work, but I'm always afraid of damaging that front exposed element."
5,I am so pleased !,"A great, sharp, fun lens that I waited a long time researching before my final decision to buy it and I am so glad I finally made my move.It is a productive tool in the field and not just a pricey special effects toy. I am very pleased with my decision!"
4,Great Lens,"I have been using this lens for almost a month & it's a lot of fun. It really preforms at it's peak in outdoor shooting, however, I have obtained some good indoor shots as well. I only wish that it was a zoom lens but for the money it's well worth it. I love playing with different angles when shooting with this lens. Definitely a must for someone who wants to throw an edge on their photos!"
4,Great lens but...,"I bought a Tokina 10-17 mm and started shooting with it. I liked it but I felt it was not sharp enough and I heard about the colour aberrations.Therefore I went to bring it back to B&H; and I upgraded with the Nikkor 10.5This is absolutetly more sharp and fast. The only two things that I found bad are:1) the lens is much more difficult to keep clean than the Tokina's one;2) why the hell Nikon decided to produce expensive lenses like the Wideangle 12-24 mm and this Fisheye in crappy plastic?! For keeping down their weight? Fck the weight issue and give me some old time, long lasting great metal body lenses!!!!"
5,A brilliant lens,"This is a great lens. It feels like a quality product and produces pin sharp images. The depth of field is massive which means that you can ensure that pretty much any picture is in focus from foreground to background. I use it with my D80 in which I have the grid display in the viewfinder switched on by default. This is really useful when shooting landscapes with this lens. If you ensure that the horizon is in the center of the frame when taking the picture you can minimize any obvious distortion and then crop the 'photo in post production to move the horizon from the center. I also enjoy taking extreme close-ups which can look really good. It is possible to alter an image to ""normal"" perspective in post processing but I like the fisheye look. I hesitated before buying the lens because I thought I might end up with a novelty lens, but it's certainly not that and whilst it is a fun lens it can be used in all sorts of environments"
3,AF does not work with all digital cameras,"I bought this for my wife's D5100. When I searched for digital lenses, this one showed compatible. While is does work with the D5100, it only works in manual mode. It produces clear, sharp images, and the wife loves it, so it's worth keeping.The product states in it's operators manual that the AF function is only for the DX2, and DX3 series digital cameras only. It does not work in AF mode with the DX50, 500, 5000 DX70, 700, 7000 or DX90 series cameras. Something left out in the seller's description.I suggest that when searching for a lens on Amazon, you go to the manufacturer's web site to make sure all the lens functions work with your camera. Something I will start doing."
4,i recommend this lens,"..very good lens...only thing that kinda sucks is that you have to manual focus and it says its autofocus...its autofocus works but only on nikon d2-series and d300 series...when using the lens for d5000, d3000, d60, and d40 series you have to set the focus mode on manual. Not a difficult task to do but i just expected it to be autofocus cuz thats what it says on the box and item description....other than that the lens is amazing...worth the money.."
4,Fisheye Fun,"The lens works very well - it does not make the pictures extremely round, but enough for special effects"
4,"Great glass, but....","I recently purchased this glass from Amazon for my Nikon D80 and D200, but unfortunately, it did not fit on the D200 as it should have. It was tight going on and caused the focus ring to jam. It made no sense!! Because I purchased it to use on both bodies, I was forced to return it. Maybe Nikon can explain why it didn't fit the D200"
2,Not happy,"For the amount of money I spent it was not what I thought it would be. I have used other nikkor lenses, but I am not really happy about the value for the money. Just the one angle, no zoom. Its hard to look like I'm not in a tunnel."
5,great price and just what I ordered,I priced this same product at my doctor's office and it was double the price...same brand; same product. Even with reasonable shipping it was much less.
3,Photo VERY Misleading,I would have given this review a 5 star had the photo not been misleading. I truly thought that I was receiving a variety of ice packs in this shipment and that is what is pictured. Shame on my for not reading the description. I am glad that I somehow ended up with the neck contour because that is really the one that I wanted for now. This product definitely works well. I have a polar care ice machine after knee replacement but wanted something that i can quickly ice my knee with after PT exercises. I love the weight and cold of this product. Please change your item picture though. I see other comments that it is very misleading as well.
5,very cold and flexible,"It gets and stays VERY cold for well past the required 20 minutes, which makes this much more effective than other similar cold packs that I have used.Flexibility is great, so you can really wrap it tight and get good contact with the skin. This is great benefit of gel packs.Tips: Use a bandana/kerfchief or a thin cloth, other wise it will be too cold to start. You will need some elastic band to hold it in place. Something like theElastic Velcro Sports Ankle Protector Strap Band Brace Support"
4,Soft and Cool,"I had two of the cold packs from the hospital one died/got a hole in it. These are nice and soft feeling but do not hold the cold as long as the one from the hospital. Those have something in that freezes harder. I would like to get another one of these because sometimes it doesn""t last long enough. I would say they are good for 45 min. to hour. This one fits the neck nicely. I would say I have a thin neck. I need them for osteoarthritis of the neck and fibro so I use them constantly. You can even walk around with it on your neck."
1,not good quality,"I bought this in early Oct 2010 for my knee pain, used 3~4nights per week, treated carefully and gently, in early Jan 2011, leak and needed to throw away, I am disappointed with such a short usage, I don't think it's good quality, not recommend this product."
3,The Maxx is fantastic but...,"But it's sadly been hacked down from its original form when it aired on MTV.Hopefully, though its extremely unlikely, we'll see a complete and unedited version released on DVD."
3,Missing so much,"3 stars just because it's missing so much content. However, I did manage to get the entire series and burn it to a dvd so, that's at least a plus. But this VHS is missing a lot of content. Hopefully MTV releases an official DVD of The Maxx. Until then I've got a copy : )"
5,DVD what deserve to be on DVD!,"So, for what can I read, i'm not the only one that thinks MTV (around the world, I have to suffer the latin american version) is now pure garbage.That gives me hope. An a DVD release will be appropiate. I need it, we deserved it. There's a lot of unique material only on VHS or even in no format at all and a lot of so-call art in the format you want it that I can't believe it. This is a world for low-spectations people."
1,Editors scissors sharper than Maxx's claws.,"Very good animation and story, but some of the best parts have been edited out. An example and one of my favorites, is where Maxx is small and he dives into the sink and then fights the Black IS with a ladle. One whole half hour episode with Hammer Head is missing. Some, maybe most of the lighter moments, which help to counterbalance the more gloomy and serious ones are gone, making the video seem very heavy. As you watch you can actually see where they cut due to the jumpyness of some of the sequences. It seems like every other second was cut from the series. I would not recommend buying this video."
5,This is a must for DVD,"A few years ago I stumbled across this while watching late nite YTV (a canadian kids/young adult network)and was amazed at the depth of the writing and effort that was put into this cartoon.The artwork was creative and though provoking, with just enough comic relief to make this show less dark and depressing. After watching a few episodes I went out and bought the graphic novel and discovered a it was based on a comic book series from Image comics. The comics are a must read, 'specially the issue on the 'creation' of Mr. Gone. I think that after you read these comics, you'll have a greater love for this series.And if any of you out there can find the producers, convince them to put this series on DVD right away!!! Altought the vhs version is awsome, it is missing some of my favorite scenes ( when MAKO attacks or when he tells the story of the two worlds colliding to the kids)... Atleast on DVD, I won't burn it out from watching too much!!!"
5,The Best Show MTV Ever Made or Will Ever Make,Adding my voice to the clamor calling for an official unedited DVD release is my pleasure. The Maxx is te best written TV show I have ever seen. This is animation at it's finest.
4,The MAXX COOL!,Ive never read the comic but who wantss to spend $...on one issue???Anyway I rented this at my favorite video rental shop and grab it along with aeon flux my favorite was aeon flux but writing a Review for the maxx so Im not going into that.The Maxx is cool looking but the story is super confussing and made my brain hurt!Anyway it is pretty good if you like liqiud television like i do.Great artwork!
5,"The Maxx is the best, and nothing's better than The Maxx!","If I could only say one thing about The Maxx, and I kinda can only say one thing with this limited space, it would be that The Maxx is the most awesome character ever thought up by anyone anywhere any time, period."
1,Boring made film !,"The film was really badly done , it was so boring ! I love traveloque films , but this film must have been done 30 years ago.The area is beautiful , and someone with talent could have made the film interesting .I wish that the BBC had done the film , or even a French Production .Plus the guy who commended on the films couldn't even pronounce the names of the towns correctlyWaste of time and money!Try and find a good book area of the area ."
3,strong chemical hair remover,"After diligently following the instructions I found this product to work to satisfaction. However, it does leave a persistent odor that reminds me of a hair salon --the smell given off by hair being destroyed by the chemicals in it.From my experience:The Good+Will weaken hair to the point it just brushes off with a cloth+Leaves no rash from hair removalThe Bad-Doesn't always evenly remove hair, always some stubborn hairs-Causes burning in ARMPITS in less than 4 minutes-Can leave extremely sensitive burn spotsThe main thing to remember in your first use of this product is that some people have more sensitive skin. If you have very sensitive skin, I would not reccomend using this product. ""This product is not for use on the genitals."" Always follow the directions. So if you burn your genitals because you didn't read the directions don't say nobody warned you, it's on the label."
1,lord have mercy on your poor poor soul,"this stuff burns like the hellfire. the directions say to leave it on for 4 minutes, but you'll be lucky if you can make it past the first 60 seconds without bolting for the fire extinguisher. by minute two, the chemicals have eaten through your epidermis while carefully avoiding all the hair that you wanted removed. oh and remeber to wear a gas mask, because the chemical fumes and stench of burning hair/skin is not all it's cracked up to be. personally, i attribute the invention of this product to nazi scientists, because i can't see any practical use for it other than pure torture."
1,Just set your back on fire instead...,I just used this product after carefully reading all of the instructions and warning labels. I used it on my back only after testing a small area per the instructions. I tested a small area on my upper arm and it seemed fine) so I proceeded to apply to my whole back. Shortly after the application my back felt like it was lit on fire. Several hours later it still feels like I have a real nasty sun burn. I wish I had read some of these reviews before buying the product. Don't risk trying it. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to going to the spa and getting my back waxed. I will take that over Nair any day of the week. In fact I would sooner light my back on fire rather than ever try that product again. I'm sure that would at least remove the hair. The one positive review I have seen reads like a commercial so I'm guessing that one is from the Nair management.
5,If you are in IT Sales you need this book!,I found this book to be a lifesaver for me as I work for an IT service company and the companies included in this book are my clients. Thank you Mr Williams - you did the research for me! It was invaluable to learn what makes each of these people tick. It also helped me to become more excited about my own career as I adopted some key strategies.
5,What a great resource book!,"As a real estate broker who deals specifically with hotels and motels, I find this to be a great book for my clients. Wether it be a 20 unit motel or a 120 unit hotel, this sales and marketing book is a great tool. I have presented this book to my clients during the initial phase, as we are looking at many different properties, to prepare them for what lies ahead and so that they can learn how to maximize the potential of their property to gain a wide customer base. I have also given the book to clients when we ""close"" the property so that they can learn different ways to maximize their income. Even when the clients have management experience this book can help with new ideas. I have received nothing but positive feedback from my clients on how this book has helped them and their success is my success!"
3,ok but not great,"I agree with another reviewer that this is a naive little book. I'd go as far as calling it simplistic. The point that I like is that it is not an academic theoretical tome, but practical. It does cover some basics, but nothing really that anyone with some experience in the field would not know anyway. The book it is being sold together with, Heads In Beds: Hospitality and Tourism Marketing, which is a book that I would wholeheartedly recommend. I just recently read it (it came out not too long ago) and it is on my reference shelf. Very complete without being daunting, with great examples, illustrations and a wide range of topics. That one is worth the price, truly a gem of a hospitality marketing book."
4,Great text book for students and experienced hotel executives,I have learned the basics of hotel business after 30 years experience inhotel industry. A book to read over and over again when you need a new idea.
2,Dissapointment,"The book itself, yes, covers all the segments in the battle for occupancy and quality of the service BUT - there is no great discoveries, and few of the examples given are -to put it mildly said- naive. Perhaps I would have been a student - I would have found it satisfying, but if you are in this business, even though there are hardly major 'Eureka's' n this business- more examples and less beating around the bushes - would left me satisfied. This way, if you want to be reminded on the all -time values- take it, but if you wish to learn something new or take a look from a different angle - keep looking."
3,Disappointing,"This book was a disappointment to me. Ms. Krims is certainly talented--but in a sort of loud and juvenile way, at least for my tastes. My wife said it best, after flipping through the book: This looks like what you do when you are in college, trying to disguise an ugly room. The book lacks subtlety. Her color palettes for the most part are too loud for my tastes--and I like color (I have a mango kitchen and apple green office). I agree with my wife: most of her color schemes would work best to disguise an ugly space or to distract the viewer from cheap furniture or some other bad feature in the room. I can't imagine using many of her color palettes in designing a room with great architectural features or a room that will be filled with beautiful furniture. Also, if you are looking for theory, this book has scant if any of it. This was not what I was looking for."
2,Very Bold Color Palette,"I just returned this book because I thought the colors were too bold, garish in some cases. For example, imagine a combination of black, salmon pink, and pistachio green. If you are daring this book could work for you. But if you are an all-white-wall person like me, just branching out, I think you better pick another book."
4,Vibrantly Colored Rooms,"This book has good, clear photos and include the paint brand (Glidden, Benjamin Moore, Sherwin-Williams) and color number. Always helpful when you are trying to match colors. Most of the rooms are very vibrant in color and the rooms are decorated in a mostly traditional style. Very nice book if you like vibrant colors, but my taste leans to a more subdued color palette."
5,Great to read to my children!,"This is a great set to read to the kids! I am serving overseas on a deployment so I oredered two sets, one sent here and one home. Every week I send a video home with me reading my copy and they read along back home. I can't wait to read in person again!"
5,Banana Bay,"Banana Bay was a wonderful read, the elaborate plot shows Cindy has really been there. Her one liners are sharp, the dialogue is polished to a high shine...Terrific. Can't wait for her next endeavor. Linda Roberts"
2,Half ripe Banana Bay,"After several extended trips to Bocas Del Toro, Panama, I was excited about reading a mystery that takes place there. The first third of the book is pretty decent. Nice character and site descriptions, interesting plot and real suspense. After that it falls apart, meandering between anticlimactic action scenes and boring dialogue. What more is that Mattie Maitlin is a complete cluts and hardly takes on the roll of ""hero."" The final scenes are dull, almost painfully so. Ms. Cody should take a few lessons from John D. MacDonald and Tom Corcoran before attempting another mystery."
3,Sufficient but not great,"Just returned from the Greek islands. I brought this Fodor's book and the Greek Islands book by Dana Facaros. While this book certainly had prettier pictures compared to the Facaros/Cadogan humble graphics, the Facaros book, hands down, had more AND BETTER information than this Fodor's book."
2,It broke after one month and reception is poor.,"The antenna broke after one month and there is no replacement available from Samsung. They said to send it in, which means I would be without my phone for who knows how long. Then I read some reviews about poor reception from this phone and decided just to buy a new Motorola e815 (at the full price) and the difference is incredible. Also, if I break the Motorola antenna it easily unscrews so I can replace it. The Samsung is half the phone of the Motorola. There is no comparison."
3,Try it before you buy it.,"I bought this phone to use on the Verizon Network and try the new V Cast features they offer. I returned it and bought the CDM8940. The volume on the A890 was just way too low for my tastes. I'm sure it may be loud enough for some, but I could hardly hear my calls. I tried another one in the store, and it was the same. Otherwise, it performed ok. ...and no, I don't have any hearing problems."
3,Be Careful What You Wish For,"The game Starcraft has been almost universally lauded for its storyline. While playing the game years ago, I couldn't help but wish that someone would turn the storyline into a novel. Apparently, someone heard my wish and sent me Liberty's Crusade. I also realize that I made a mistake.The novel is the serialization of the first 10 missions of the computer game. Which is fine, except that the most interested readers probably already beat the game and know the storyline. The novel doesn't add anything to the Starcraft mythos and manages only to revisit a path that has already been followed. I was hoping for so much more then this novel delivers. The characters that weren't in the original game are at best two-dimensional.Hopefully, the next novel in the series will continue where the game left off and rekindle some of the excitement of the computer game in time for the inevitable (but never soon enough) sequel."
3,Not all it's cracked up to be...,StarCraft for the PC was an extraordinary game in which players have to use strategy and battle in great wars against the Zerg and Protoss (which most of you should know). The book on the other hand has about two fights and absolutely no strategy. You kinda lose the feel of the game when this occurs. The author brings the storyline and characters to life very well... unfortunately he couldn't do that with the battles and the strategy behind the fights. The whole Michael Liberty view was brilliant but still not enough. I rate this 3 stars frankly for the well written character profiles and storyline. If the action was there it would be a definite 5. I suggest only for the fans of StarCraft.
4,Fun and light read,"This was fun for me to read. Something that nobody else has mentioned is that this book has got some humor in it, unlike Shadow of the Xel'Naga (don't read that one). Maybe it's just me, but I found this pretty funny in parts. Mike Liberty is a great character, very believable, and generally likable. The existing characters (Raynor, Kerrigan, Duke, Mengsk) were all kept the same and were very well portrayed, with the possible exception of Raynor. The descriptions don't quote the Starcraft manual, and they were well written. I enjoyed this book a lot."
4,"A boring start, but an AMAZING finish","I have always wished that some director would see the beauty of StarCraft's sotry line and transform it into a movie. Well, part of my wish came forth when this book was published. The first few chapter were boring and I was about to put the book aside. However, I read on just for the heck of it. But, as I reached the fifth/sixth chapter, I was so engrossed into the book, i couldn't leave it! I stayed up 2 nights just to finsih it!The only downfall is that the book takes teh original starcraft mission story line and protrays it through a reporter. I would've preferred something that built on where the game ended.... perhaps soon!"
4,A Good Read,"This book was based almost line to line to the game. They even quoted some of the main heros. I give it a four. There isn't much I can say about this one. Except if your a hardcore ""Starcraft"" fan, this books for you."
3,Good for Starcraft fans,"I've played & loved Starcraft so I decided to buy this book.The plot covers the first 10 mission of Starcraft, which is great if you have played the game (because you can recognize every place where you fought or every dialog spoken in the briefing room) but otherwise disappointing (the places/units/races/characters are not very well described sometimes).I think the author did a good job in devloping people like Raynor (a little less good with Kerrignan, but it is the character itself to be difficult to ""paint""), and when he have some free space he really makes feel us the world of starcraft (two thumbs up for Liutenant Emily, i.e.)In few words, if you liked the game buy this, it is well written & so on. The only drawback is thath seldom add something new to the story developed in the game"
5,GREAT READING!,"I am a Starcraft player of several years, and when I saw this book in my local book store I jumped at the chance and bought it. I was not let down. The book closely follows the plot, showing in detail what occurs throughout the storyline. Direct quotes from the game are also used. Aside from that, the book is also a very good work of literature. I greatly enjoyed reading it."
2,Liberty's Crusade Real Disappointment.,"I usually like books based on games I have played before. This is the first exception. It is basically a summory of the Terrin campaign missions through the eyes of news reporter Mike Liberty. (hence the title) While I found the plot from the game quite good, the second way through it just is boring. if you have ever played and beaten the Starcraft Terrin Campaign (and if you are looking at the book I don't see how you coulnd't have) then you know the whole plot of the book. I have already read other Blizzard novels (Warcraft: Day of the Dragon being one of them) and I have to say, sadly, this does not live up to the standard."
3,"Good for what it is, but poor for what it isn't.","Unfortunately, ""Liberty's Crusade"" doesn't measure up with similar adaptations of sci-fi universes. But as a page-turning paperback, it does it's job. Instead of ramble on about how extremely good or bad it is, I'll just give the pro's and con's.Stays faithful to most original plot, which is good I suppose. It expanded out the Mar Sara plot a bit more, which is a good thing since it was interesting. The character development is decent.It borrows *too* much from outside sources, such as the original StarCraft campaigns, the Dune novels (the writing style is basically ripped off from Frank Herbert's own), etc. This makes it boring."
4,Great Book!,"If you are a fan of the game you will love the book. I was completely engrossed, and could not put it down. I just wish it would have been longer and more in depth. The timeline in the book was jammed together and should have been expanded. Overall, a great read that leaves you wanting more."
3,It's ok,A good readLead up to the next book because you want to find out more and if u play the game a different perspective
3,Not as good as it seems,"I thought that the book Liberty's Crusade, by Jeff Grubb, was an okay book. I would rate it about three out of five because it didn't exactly have the greatest plot. The author went into pretty good detail about the characters and the setting, which gave you a better visual idea of what was happening. In the book it seemed like you needed to have knowledge of the video game ""Star Craft"" because that is what everything in the book is based on. Most of the main characters were from that game. I think Jeff Grubb is very, very creative. I think the book could have been more entertaining. Overall the book was okay but could have been better."
3,"good book, but not quite as expected","I thought that this book would be action packed and exciting; however, it doesn't give much details on any one battle or focus on some specific issue in starcraft in general. As a result, the book covers almost from the whole starcraft game's story line(which is huge), and what should have been a 3 book serie is packed into one 400 pages book.The story is quite vague, and I would like to see more specific details on battles and that sort. As a book, i think it's not bad, but as a starcraft book(which is what it is), I think it needs more improvement."
1,What a Disappointment!,"This book is a real disappointment. To StarCraft fans and not. I happen to be a StarCraft fan and this book has no real dramatic point it, except near the end, but who couldn't see that! If you don't understand the game though. This is a great item to help whats happening in the game!"
5,"Brilliant, honest, and oftentimes funny.","This one of the best books on American society that I have ever read! This book is what people who try hard to understand the source of racial tension in this country have been waiting for. There is really something in here for everyone and must be read from cover to cover. No matter who you are, examples extracted from life in this book will disturb you in its honesty and you actually see yourself. This is not an overly intellectual essay but an accessible and poignant work that is completely plucked from real life and experience. It just required a brilliant author to put it all together."
1,Ustad Shahid Pervez Khan Sahib,"The Shahana that Shujhat played was enjoyable especially for a novice to Indian classical music. Shujhat has a sweet hand for non clasical/filmi/folk music. However the Shahana was clearly an imitatation of the same raga rendered by the virtuoso sitarist Shahid Pervez Khan. Shujhat did a good job in following the the basic frame work of Shahid pervez, but obviously and conciously did not attempt to play the intricate patterns of the raga as Shahid Pervez did. I give kudos to Shujjhat who has made a brave effort to walk in the footsteps of the great Shahid Pervez. A reccomendation for all Indian classical music listeners is to order The Immotive Sitar by Shahid Pervez this can be ordered by amazon. I have reccomended this album to many friends who have thanked me for many hours of the greatest sitar music in the world"
3,"cat or dog toy, lol","My cat will play with this periodically, when he is in the mood. Typically he will play if I play with him. Seems my dog enjoys it more. I can't get her away from it. It's a great toy if your pet is into this sort of thing. It's nothing fancy, very simple, quiet. Mouse seems to be sturdy enough to handle swatting by cat or dog. I only give it 3 stars because it's not an item to really brag about. It serves it's purpose and is a good value if you find for under $10 (I wouldn't spend more than that)."
2,Too small and unstable,"My cats love the Turbo TrackBergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary, so I thought they'd really like this, given the similarity in design. But, they batted at it a couple times, then lost interest. I even sprinkled cat nip on it. Still minimal interest. It's a lot smaller than the Turbo Track, probably about 2/3 the size, and very light-weight - when my cats bat at the mouse to get it to move, the whole thing moves across the floor. I'm sure some cats like this, just not a keeper for my crew."
1,Older Cats Owner,"Well, it is cute and well built. But older cats were not interested in the toy at all. Maybe younger cats would be but I don't see them playing with it for very long."
2,"Well made, but not getting much use.","I purchased this cat toy because of so many reviews indicating it provided hours of entertainment. I have two very playful 4 month old kittens. They play with it for 2 minutes and then ignore it for days. It is very sturdy and well made, but not worth keeping around."
3,Siamese Chases Mouse,Dusty was interested in the Cat N Mouse Powered toy for a while but only plays with it on occasion. Sometime I hear him playing with it in the night!
2,Boring,Gets old for the cats very fast. They seemed to like it for the first 10 minutes. After that it just sits around not getting used. I would not recommend it because of that. It works like it's suppose to.
3,Always hopeful.,"The first day introduction went well. I had hope. Wrong again. Chumley is one blase cat. Nothing holds his interest for very long but I keep trying. Don't believe that there is anything wrong with the product, just the wrong cat trying it out."
5,Cat Tormentor,"I have 4 cats two stay inside all the time and two spend the day outside and sleep inside at night. I was looking for something to help entertain them while they were in the house. Believe me a board cat can be a pain in the back side, they will entertain themselves. At first when I received them they appeared t o be cheaply made, but thinking you get what you pay for, I was wrong don't let appearances fool you, very simple construction not what you are going to think believe me. I have bought 6 of these, I have two in use and 4 as spares, not due to construction of the product but to have spares uncase I could not find them again, my cats have assaulted these and the original two are still functions perfectly (3 months later) recommend them to anyone who has cats inside, Also my Jack Russell found them quite entertaining as well"
5,Just what I wanted.,"I love this CD. Being a Joan Baez fan, I am alway looking for new music by her. I listen to this CD in the everyday and I'm not tiring of it. ."
5,One Day At A Time by Joan Baez,One Day at a Time is my favorite from Joan Baez. I had the record and just had to get the CD. The music is as revelent today as it was 30 years ago and just as personal. This is a keeper for the ages.
4,Country-Folk Joan at her finest!,"This is one of Joanie's best albums, and writing about it will do it no justice. Just listen!"
5,Great product,"I bought this primarily to use during travel to extend the operating time of my iPhone. In my unofficial tests, this power pack completely recharged the iPhone (which was below 20% power) twice before needing to be plugged in itself. It's lightweight, simple to use, and it looks nice...what more could you ask? Buy one if you need to charge USB devices!"
2,"The battery stopped working after two recharges. Hence, two stars.","This battery worked well until the third time it was recharged. After that, dead as a post."
5,APC Back Up Battery,"The back up battery was just what I needed. Compact, functional and meets my needs. I would recommend it to anyone who uses multiple devices and travels a lot."
3,Buyer Beware,"Be careful with this. I just bought an APC Mobile Power Pack for $19.95 at Staples. It was on sale -- normally 49.95 -- but significantly less expensive than here, obviously."
3,Great till it broke,Worked great charging my iphone twice. Then it wouldn't recharge. Spoke with APC customer service for 40 minutes before they finally decided they needed to replace the unit.Update 12/15/2008: Just wanted to update this to say that the replacement unit also quit taking a charge. I won't be asking for yet another replacement.
2,Not for PSP,"The UPB10 information says that it will charge portable gaming systems and some of the advertisements show what looks like the outline of a Playstation Portable (PSP). However, the PSP does not charge via its mini USB port and APC has not released a cable that will connect to the 5 volt DC input to the PSP (nor do they have an estimated date of availability).A bit of deceptive advertising in my opinion."
2,"Great Idea, poorly executed......","The APC UPB10 powerpack comes with no cabling, no 'nuthin. Just a battery that shuts off after 15 minutes of runtime. I've been using it as a paperweight."
1,Really disappointed,"I bought it to charge my Nokia N810 PDA and my daughter's Nintendo DS or PSP while on the road. It does not work on any of those! It only works for my verizon cell phone. I guess the problem is it has a very limited charging capability. Anything bigger than the cell phone shuts down the battery circuit.I later bought a Duracell backup battery, which works great on all of my devices. But it has only 1000mAhour of energy, which is about half of the APC unit.The APC unit looks good and has good energy level. But it is only good on paper. Big disappointment, especially considering the price tag!!!"
4,Very useful,"I bought this product because I was taking a long flight to Europe.It did just what it was supposed to. You get about 2 iPhone charges out of it. It is very lightweight and sleek, so it is easy to carry around. Sometimes I even stick it into my pants pocket if I'm in a hurry.Having to press the button a couple of times to fully charge my phone does become annoying, that is why I am not giving it 5 stars.It would be nice if they came out with a thicker, double-duty version good for 4 charges. I would definitely buy that!"
5,Works as advertised. Great battery backup.,I ordered this based on a friends recommendation. It works great and is very light for a battery backup.
1,"Battery long discontinued, what you buy now is stale","Just bought 2 of these, and neither worked at all out of the box. When I called APC to do a warranty claim, they said that these batteries were ""long discontinued"" and they did not have any in stock to fulfill the warranty. As a matter of fact, they said APC exited the portable battery business all together and don't even have comparable products to offer me. They suggested I return through Amazon (which I am).Incidentally I had 2 of these batteries previously, which died recently almost simultaneously after many, many years of working great for our family. These batteries were great, that's why I tried to get the same ones to replace them.My conclusion is that any of these APC batteries you find now are all going bad on the shelf (the date on the non-functioning batteries I received said 2006) and won't last long after you purchase them. Probably better to spend your money elsewhere."
5,Excellent!,"This is an excellent product and keeps our humidifier ""musty smelling"" free! Will buy again and again! :)"
4,decent product for the price,"First of all, lux casing send the wrong product, had to send it again and wait for another week to get this. nice product for the price and comes with a car chareger. I would recommend this product, one flaw is, if you opt for ground shipping, it takes complete 2 weeks which is a very long wait time. if the shipped in faster, I would recommend to all users of pearl 8100."
4,Good deal,"For the price, this is a decent phone cover. However, phone key pad must be locked to avoid accidental dialing."
4,Panther figure glued to the outside of clamshell case now,The female Pink Panther figure included as a bonus is glued to the OUTSIDE of the clamshell CASE. There was just a very small bit of glue involved which cleaned up with the wipe of a paper towel. So theres no need to be worried about any glue being on the actual VHS cassette.
1,THIS TAPE RUINED MY VCR,"THE CASE THIS TAPE CAME IN WAS FULL OF GLUE AROUND THE EDGES AND THE GLUE WAS ALSO ON THE TAPE ITSELF. I THOUGHT I HAD ALL THE GLUE OFF THE TAPE AND WHEN I PUT IT IN THE VCR. THE VCR ATE THE TAPE. IT WOULD NOT LET THE TAPE BE REMOVED AND BY THE TIME WE GOT THE TAPE OUT, THE MACHINE WAS RUINED AND SO WAS THE TAPE. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS DISTRIBUTOR TO MY WORSE ENEMY.I WISH I WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE ADVISE OF THE OTHERS THAT WROTE REVEIWS. MY SON WANTED THE CARTOONS SO BADLY I BOUGHT THE DUMB TAPE. PLEASE DONT BE AS BIG A SUCKER AS I WAS."
4,SHE IS A NICE SPIRIT,"No trick, no manipulation: simple and natural like nature itself. Brings the peace in you. Pay attention and open your heart, because she is sending a message in a very gentle way."
5,Love story,"Cute love story even if it is dated. One of my favorites. Kinda sweet, but a cuddle on the couch kind of movie."
1,"Laserpod took my money to fix, never returned!",I think they are out of business now as their website has been down since at least the 1st of December but I sent $30 and my entire Laserpod kit to get it repaired and I have no way of getting a hold of them and it has been months and I have not gotten the Laserpod back and they cashed the check!
2,Not to great,"I bought this game(I'm 11 years old) because I like spongebob, but when I bought it I found out it wasn't that good.All it does is just play 2 min. of an episode. I did'nt like this game that much."
2,Margaret deserves better!!,"This book reveals a great deal of information that relates Margaret Mitchell, the woman, to ""Gone With the Wind"", the book. Sadly, this could have been a wonderful book but the author's lack of sympathy with the subject is a noticable. The author's disrespect for a courageous and talented woman only made me think less of the author and more of Peggy Marsh. Perhaps if there had been a better editor......"
4,A companion book to Gone With the Wind,This is the story of the author of Gone With The Wind and the story surrounding her famous novel. The personality and life experiences of Margaret Mitchell are woven into Gone With Wind. To read either Road To Tara or Gone With The Wind necessitates reading the other.Anne Edwards is the author of the biography of Vivien Leigh and was to write the sequel to Gone With The Wind which was never published.
4,Sturdy,"Great product, but READ the instructions CAREFULLY before assembling. The brackets to the rake have a minute difference in size on each end. If you try to install them before understanding this, you will curse and sweat for a half-hour like I did :) When fully assembled, it will be like raising a flag pole. Start raising at the shovel end and work your way to the handle. I mostly use it to knock down lethal icicles that develop over walkways."
2,Survived Almost One Use.,"I live in the mountains of Utah. Frequent heavy snowfall is the norm around here. This rake almost completed one use before the handle split. They used way to thin of aluminum tubing to construct the telescoping handle. The handle that came with my rake broke trying to support its own weight on its way to the roof. I didn't even use all three extensions. I managed to finish the job using lumber, hose clamps and duct tape. I returned unit to Walmart for a full refund and wouldn't consider purchasing another one. This is a very flimsy design. I can't see a tool like this making more than a single season even if you were one of the lucky ones that got a better handle. If your going to take a chance on this unit, buy it from someone who will let you return it without a hassle. It wasn't worth the 39.95 I paid."
3,it is ok but not very useful to me,The product will be only good for a roof that simply just goes straight down. It won't help if a roof has valley or if a roof is high at the edges which is what I have and which needs to be cleaned when there are lots of snow. Unfortunately it won't help me because it can't be turned or bent.
4,snow rake,This is one tough rake. i broke my last one. the arms that come out on the sides really support it. the 4 lengths of pole let me get up on my colonial roof a ways. Very nice
4,Really came in handy!,"Many of us can relate to this tough winter. To date, we have had more than six feet of snow and were concerned about the weight on the roof. This snow rake did a really good job at getting a lot of it off the roof and without any damage to the shingles. It has a good extension reach and is light enough to allow you to work with it for extended periods."
5,Ideal roof rake,"Anyone with snow on their roof should seriously consider this product. Living in Sweden we get a lot of snow and clearing the roof regularly is a must. Crawling around the roof with a shovel works but is dangerous, using the Suncast roof rake from the ground couldn't be easier or safer. Would highly recommend this product and supplier, good quality and excelent service."
5,Excellent product,I got this 2 years ago and bought it because my neighbors roof caved in with all the snow we had.Never used it until last week.This works awesome I have a gravel roof and it just glided over it.I did my whole house in 30 minutes.last time with out the snow shovel it took me 4 hours and was scared I was going to fall of the roof!! It does get a little heavy when you hook up all the poles but it is still light considering how long it is.A great tool in the fight against snow.
4,be careful to recheck wingnuts for tightness,"It definitely does the job and is not difficult to assemble. However, I would have liked warning in the instructions to recheck all nuts for tightness before every use. This is critical because the instructions tell you not to overtighten those nuts.I lent it to a neighbor, and when he was finished one of the braces (and the bolt and two wingnuts securing it) was missing, unlikely to be seen again before our snow melts. This is important because Suncast does NOT carry replacement parts for it -- and their customer service will tell you to contact local hardware stores. The retailer who sold it told me Suncast doesn't provide them with replacement parts and they don't carry custom machined braces.Long story short: the product is good, but you're on your own if you need to replace a part."
4,Does The Job,"Like the length, but it gets a bit wobbly as expected, the tubing is not that thick, to keep the weight down. Let me just say that it was QUITE a workout pulling 1+ feet off the roof. ;)"
3,communications,"Although I did receive the snow shovel I ordered within three weeks of purchase, the wait was long. No communications from the vendor in regards to when or if the item will ever reach me. In fac I did cancel the order, only to find the item at my doorstep three days later.It was a hard item to find, during a time when no one had inventory."
2,oversold this item when I needed it the most,"Amazon oversold this item when I needed it the most. First said it would ship in two days, prior to huge storm in Ct. Well it didn't come for nearly three weeks later and I made a make shift roof rake of my own, no thanks to Amazon so I have no idea how this product works, hopefully better then Amazons purchasing site. I will not be ordering from this site again. I should have gone to e-bay site. They had a bunch of them for the same price and no problem shippping. Buyers be aware if its a ""hot item"" Amazon will most likely screw it up."
4,More than adequate in the event of a snow crisis!,"This shovel is as marketed correctly but is not easy to use, especially at full (21') length. At its maximum dimension, the rake is somewhat awkward to control. Operating at full length involves some areal nimbleness, as the lightweight pole sways significantly at the ultimate reach. Nevertheless, the light weight, surprising strength, combined with the reasonable price, render this tool a decent snow roof rake (especially in emergencies as experienced by us.) Larger, higher or multiple roof areas will entail considerable physical exertion, but I imagine this to be the case regardless of the brand at a reach of 20' plus."
5,SUNCAST SNOW ROOF RAKE,"I have not used the product yet (not enough snow) but I have assembled it and put it through a dry-run. I have no reason to think it would not work well in actual deep snow conditions. It is light weight/maneuverable but sturdy, head made of the right materials (gray polycarbonate = lexan, right?), poles are right length for most single-story buildings and would even clear several feet of most two story roofs, head width/depth/contour strikes me as being perfect, and coating on lower pole is a nice touch. Could it be improved? Yes. I would add a couple of removable assist handles for the poles and possibly a hinged, solid lexan top plate to control the depth of the cut into the snow. I plan to use it on a two story flat roof by adding a flexible section of pole. Hope it works!"
1,Fell apart after 3 months,"After owning this for 3 months and removing snow from only 4 storms, the plastic rake part chipped in several places. Today, the whole rake part sheared off the metal pole and is now useless. Not built to last."
4,It Worked.,"I used it a couple of times one winter. Not something I need to use every time it snows and I hope I never will. It was what I expected and worked fine. There are nicer ones for more money. The more snow and how often you'll need to use it should determine what you spend. The lighter it is the easier it will be to use, but just the shear length of it makes it a little awkward to use. I would buy it again."
4,Light weight / non heavy duty use / good,"Works, just don't expect to chop through ice or deep snow( you will have to remove in layers)...you really do not want anything that is heavy & going to HACK through your roof anyway"
3,go away snow!,"This shovel is as advertised but it's a bit tough to use. The longer you make the pole, the more unwieldy it is. You need to shovel small amounts at a time and have some upper body strength to do more than a small roof at any one time."
4,Good Value works well,This was a very good value and worked well. My only complaint is that right before I bought this we had a snow storm which put about 12 inches of snow on the roof and then a storm that brought freezing rain. It had trouble getting though the 3 inches of ice on that formed on top of the snow from the freezing rain. An all metal roof rake might work better for that. It did hold up well this winter though . If it can handle this year's snowfall it can hopefully handle any year's.
3,Various comments to make...,"Yes, as the first reviewer notes this is the Wal-Mart bonus(?) disc that apparently came with the Dignity cd. Having gotten my copy of Dignity elseware I didn't feel compelled to set foot in Wal-Mart so for me it was passable to pick it up here. That said I can say it's ok and if you have no other recent remixes it's a good 5-in-one-place kind of thing. Remixes usually always mean dance mixes, so remember that they are longer and more dance oriented than the already dancable originals. I really like Hilary's music and I love dance music but (with all due respect to those who remixed the tracks on this cd) I think Hilary's remixing world really cries out for the touch of Above and Beyond or Gabriel and Dresden. Such a pairing would really do justice and come up with something as amazing as the stars in the sky."
2,LOL,"This is a crappy cd. Hell the orginal cd is even crappy. dont waste your time with Hilary's "" DANCE "" cd....She is no Madonna...Sp please dopnt try to fill her shoes again....Next time you might want to aim to be a shoelace !"
3,plastic fountain,Received in appropiate time. Item was pretty much as expected. Works well. Almost all plastic.
3,Needs a bit more quality control,"Another QC issue - a walker is typically for people with impaired balance. Therefore, you would think their QC dept would make sure things like the hand-grips were centered. However, you'd be wrong. Both of the grips were off center by at least one inch! This is a border line safety issue. The DuroMed customer service will take your number, promise to call back, and then promptly file it in the circular file cabinet."
2,disappointed,"This unit proved functional after rework after its arrival. Several legs were bent slightly and/or misaligned enough to require installing washers to ensure secure operation and no worries about possible collapse under load. On the other hand, it's desirably lightweight and functions fine now that's it's been reworked."
2,Hemi walker review,"This walker is not made well. When the walker is opened and the brace rests horizontally on the leg, using too much pressure causes the plastic link (on the leg) to fall out."
2,Wanting in some key areas,"It's an OK book; it has good diagrams, and it's well-written. However, it has some major problems in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 that I covered:1. The examples provided in the chapter are not terribly wonderful.2. The problems at the end of each chapter can be poorly worded with respect to mathematical soundness (I found myself coming up with two answers to a problem due to ambiguity).3. Many mathematical steps are skipped in derivations."
3,looking for a decent physical chemistry book?,"The one you want is Physical Chemistry, 4/e by Laidler, Meiser, Sanctuary, ISBN 061815292X. It's the most student friendly text on the market.Description on their website says ""With its clear explanations and practical pedagogy, Physical Chemistry is less intimidating to students than other texts, without sacrificing the mathematical rigor and comprehensiveness necessary for a junior-level physical chemistry course. The text's long-standing reputation for accessible writing provides clear instruction and superior problem-solving support for students."" I second that.see my review herePhysical Chemistry. I mention the alternatives as well."
3,Poor volume levels,This alblum has terrible volume levels - you have to keep adjusting the volume up to hear the almost inaudible sections then quickly down again when it spikes very loud.
2,Petmate Kibble Keeper,"Although this product does store a 20 pound bag of dog food, just like the description says, it does not look anything like the picture. The picture shows two small access doors on top to get to the contents. However, in reality, the lid is one big piece that takes two hands to open and there is no scooper as pictured. It just wasn't worth paying the shipping charge to return it."
2,Unhandy storage,"Now that they have changed the picture you see what you get. They had a different pic up with ""extras"" in the lid. You get a plain storage bin, no kind of handle which makes 20 pounds hard to carry. Lid is difficult to open and its almost impossible to pour out of, even with the insert in the bottom. I was dissapointed."
5,Laura's Latest,"As below, I to am a Laura Pausini fan, just see my listmania. I listen to Laura only in Italian, not Spanish. If your new to Laura and want her newest songs/albums then this is where to start and go backwards in acquiring her CD's. While this latest CD is not of new material, but of Laura's favorite Italian songs done in the past. She has carefully selected and took her time in assembling this collection to cover & still this CD is amazing and I can highly recommend it. I may skip a song or two on the whole album, but no more than that. Laura's voice can rock it! and yet just as easily sing so soft and beautiful. Brava Laura, Brava!"
5,Laura is Amazing,"Laura is amazing! I don't agree with the few negative reviews. What a voice and what fun to listen to her sing the music that has meaning to her. Let yourself ""feel"" it. It is like getting to know her in a special way. Of course now I DO want to purchase some of what she has written. This is a great CD with a variety of music styles, with one common thread, Laura's passion. Even if you don't understand Italian you will learn to sing along. Io Canto rocks!"
3,Nice songs but a little expensive,"Got this for my husband, the songs are great but it's not cheap. It's okay for a gitf, but if you can buy the Mp3 format, I'd suggest that instead of getting the cd."
2,"Interesting, but unsuccessful","This book is filled with many wonderful ideas, but unfortunately it might be too many ideas.In short, some space travellers enter an area of chaotic space, and find themselves shifting between layers of reality. The author pushes the characters through a variety of tales, ranging from 007 spy type adventures, sf, and sword and sorcery fantasy.Concept-wise, it reminds me of Wilson's Schroedinger Cat Trilogy, displaying how different choices can shape our surroundings in a variety of ways. Ultimately, though, the author intrudes too much, dragging the characters through the tales instead of letting things play out in a natural way, leaving a disconnected and at times confusing narrative.Although not entirely successful, the work is short enough that a reader interested in experitation with narrative forms might find a few nuggets here and there. A reader with more mainstream taste, though, would most likely not find it worth the effort."
4,Foodsaver Necessity,"I am a Foodsaver fan - I have one for my home cooking and one at my cottage for freezing fish, game, etc. I also use these to seal camping supplies I don't what wet, sauces (you have to figure that one out yourself), dry pasta and other foodstuffs in storage. The bags are the real trade secret here, not the sealer. So buy a cheap Foodsaver sealer and get these bags - inexpensive and they work."
1,I guess it was 8 rolls,"I think it will have 8 rolls, not 1 roll, good quality but the name of the product causes confucion"
5,"So funny, so sad, so fabulous!","I laughed and cried all the way through this marvelous book. I am a Cathie Pelletier fan of many years and was thrilled to find this new offering. Dare I say that the book is heart warming? Not in a sappy way, however, but because likeable people do unlikeable things but love and common sense triumph in the end."
4,Je t'aime...moi non plus,"I bought this on a whim, and I couldn't be more thrilled with how it turned out. Along with LTM's reissue of Blurt's The Factory Recordings, it's definitely my favourite release of 2008 (although I now see it was released overseas 2 years ago). There are a few songs that bring to mind dance-y, early 80s synth pop, but most of the songs sound more like they would fit in quite well with early Factory records stuff or Belgium's Les Disques du Crepuscule. An amazing collection and you shouldn't hesitate to pick it up."
2,Dumbest purchase I've made,"Taste like... pepper. Store-bought, black, regular pepper. Nothing special here folks. I was expecting a unique flavor but was very dissappointed."
5,"Flavorable, Tasty",The strong flavor it adds to food is wonderful so much better than plain pepper. I would definitely recommend trying this.
1,"Package NOT Marked ""Tellicherry""; NO SKU or ASIN #","Received zip-lock bag of black peppercorns. Label from MoreThanAlive.com merely lists ""Black Peppercorns"".No way of telling whether these are Tellicherry, or just their bulk black peppercorns.MorethanAlive's website makes NO mention of Tellicherry. Just Black Peppercorns, in bulk, for $4.80.I ran out of pepper and don't care for a three week wait for a refund. But I will never order from this company again.BUYERS BEWARE !"
2,True Tellicherry Peppercorns?,"It is said that the Tellicherry is ""the largest of the peppercorns"". The product that I received must be from a miniature variant. Measuring in at a scant 2.5mm, my grinder turns these little corns into dust, even at the coarsest setting. The taste however, is excellent. I will utilize these in recipes calling for ""hand-cracked"" peppercorns, and will use a light hand when I do."
5,Great Value for Whole Peppercorn,"The price paid for this 1 pound bag of whole peppercorn is what I'd pay for a very small pepper mill at the grocery store. I've used them and they are flavorful, and fresh ground pepper beats previously ground any day of the week. These will last a while, but I'm happy with my purchase."
2,A Pound is a pound,I have been looking for these peppercorns and I have a question after reading the discription and shipping information...it says a pound of pepper but the shipping weight is 15.2 oz. Am I missing something here? A pound is still 16 ounces isn't it?
4,Very good peppercorns,"If you have a peppermill, this is a very good source of peppercorns. Don't waste your money on grocery store pepper. This is the way to go."
5,The perfect black pepper,"The peppercorns arrived on time and were sealed, air tight, in a thick plastic bag. I cook on a regular basis at home. I think tellicherry peppercorns are the best black pepper taste. I got some variety peppercorns years ago for my grinder, and I forgot what I was missing. Now I've got a huge supply of awesome peppercorns for stews and my grinder. This product is probably more the size that a restaurant would buy but it smells and tastes amazing, I'll share some with my neighbors."
2,Misses the Heart of Things,"I disagree with the reviewer below. I found the interchangeable protagonists in most of these stories self-impressed, disconnected. In the main, the stories are overwritten and undersubstanced. In a few, like ""The Guardian,"" the author shows what she can do when she steps back from the material. The result is a story that does achieve a Carver-like universality."
1,Born Again Bile,"The fact that Boys Keep Being Born seems to wear this writer to the bitter bone. I was beguiled by the title, but as the mother of a wonderful boy, I can only hope this particular woman hasn't borne one. If you like a jaundiced view, these are the stories for you. Ms. Frank writes beautiful, soaring sentences that distract you from the poisoned ink. Wear gloves."
4,Feel the Heat,"This baby will make it nice and toasty in a room. It has a fan built in to circulate the heat but if you're more than 10ft away do not expect much heat.It is real safe and very portable. If you get 2 to 3 of them they could heat your entire house.Just a tip, it does not circulate heat that well, so use a fan to help circulate the heat or a ceiling fan on low.For the price it is tough to beat."
1,Not worth it,"This is a flimsy item that looks likes like it will do the job but in the end won't cut it. I bought this to transport surf rods, but they large eye won't fit. The clamping device to extend and lock is plastic and will break easily. the top is screw on and the threads are to shallow, it pulls right off. Spend a few extra and get the Plano.I return this item."
3,Needs improvements,Holder is adequate as far as capacity (2 rods). Needs some sort of clasp so a lock can be attached for airline check-in. Also the oval shape makes it difficult to hold for a long time.
4,Great Pads,"These pads work great and stay in place when crawling. I'm an electrician and crawling attics and under houses is what I do. So I don't understand what the guy above is talking about?? I've put these to the test and since bought some other makes of pads that don't compare. So I'm buying another pair. I like the deep front lip/cup that keeps your knee in place when moving forward. The single strap is nice because the double straps on other models bunch up behind the knee making it uncomfortable (pinch!!). I don't give them 5 stars because I think they need more gel and some more velcro on the sides to hold the straps better for smaller legs like mine. If you're a big guy the sraps will hold fine. For me, the straps wrapped around only catching a small part of the velcro and it wore out in a few months. So I use duct tape because I like the pads."
2,"Great Padding, but Won't Stay Put","These are impressive, well-constructed knee pads, with lots of soft gel padding. Unfortunately, they won't stay put. They have a single strap across the middle of the back of the knee (compare with the kind with two straps, one above and one below the knee). If you're performing a job where you need to move around, everytime you slide a knee forward and land on the pad, you'll roll off to the side. I would only recommend these for a job where you are mostly stationary. Of course, then you could just use a knealing pad."
3,Good but not Great Knee Protection,"To be fair to the manufacturer, these knee pads are better than most that I have tried, but I need knee pads that will stay in one place when I am crawling around on the uneven ground in my garden. It doesn't take 10 seconds for them to roll out of position around my leg when I crawl and then I have to try to roll them back which is difficult when your weight is on them. I spend more time trying to keep them in place than I do in gardening sometimes. Maybe I may have skinny knees or something and the Velcro pads are in the wrong position to get the pads tight enough. Whatever the reason they don't work very well for me and I threw them out after several tries. I do have to say that the same thing happened to several other brands I have tried. Can't anybody make knee pads that will stay in place on soft irregular soil ?"
4,Teapot,"This teapot works great in the microwave, but it's handle is a small. I can't hold it with one hand when it is hot, and I'm taking it out of the microwave. It looks cool on display."
2,Get It Right,"There have only been two sizes of contemporary Fiesta. I purchased it thinking it was the ""two cup"" but it was the 44-ounce size. To my knowledge there has never been a 36 ounce teapot."
2,not functional at all...,"although the teapot is very pleasing to the eye (shape and colors)- it is not functional at all. first of all, it is very heavy. also, the handle is awkwardly shaped which makes it difficult to hold considering the weight of it. and finally, the teapot gets very hot when you try to make tea. so overall, even though it looks nice with the collection, you should get another teapot if you plan on making tea. hope this helps..."
2,Very Amateurish,"The fight sceens were stupid, could have been much better had they tried a bit harder. Sex sceens were marginal, but much better then the fight sceens."
3,A decent set,"This set is worthwhile if you want a complete set of the symphonies. Only the 6th is perhaps a first recommendation when comparing individual symphonies, though. I will more quickly turn to Abbado or Muti for 3, Szell or Karajan for 5, and Previn or Malko for 7. The second is not one that is recorded often, for good reason. It has many fine moments that are, unfortunately, drowning in a sea of loud, unsubtle noise. Neither versions of 4 are particular favorites either. But if you want a complete set, this is as good as any. But I would recommend getting the best of them (3, 5, and 6) in individual performances."
4,"NOT TOO BAD - BETTER THAN ""APOCALYPSE WATCH""","This is a book only for the die-hard Ludlum fan. I am not, so I probably should have skipped it. This is, however, slightly better than the ""Apocalypse Watch."" For the most part the book drags, but their are some VERY good and thrilling parts. I loved the ending"
3,"Good Story-line, but could have a better ending.",I read this book with a high expectation. The start was good until the middle and then it drags and then it picks up again. But the end leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Which may be good as it needs a sequel. I thought the author should have created a better end.
2,I waded through 500 pages for this?!?,"The story line had me mildly interested and I have enjoyed other Ludlum titles, so I was motivated to finish. There is no balance. Ludlum spends all of his time bringing the reader to the climax and them tries to tie the whole plot line up in the last 5 pages. It is as if he got worn out, so he just said, ""Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera..."" Come on Mr. Ludlum give the reader a little more credit."
3,Not the best book I've read.,"This book started out really good, I thought it was going to be an exciting story. But most of the way thorough it draged, and I hated the ending. It wasn't much of an ending, it stoped right where another book would start up at. For the most part this was just an average book"
5,Love this book,This was bought as a replacement for a copy that was falling apart. I have always loved this book - actually all his books. It arrived quickly and in good shape. Thanks!
1,"Contrived, convoluted plot twists with no backbone.","Contrived, bloated, disconnected, unrealistic to the extreme. The good Wolfsschanze, the bad Wolfsschanze, the Nachrichtendienst, the Odessa, the Sonnenkinder, the Rache...good god, what does Ludlum do but think up another covert cult when he needs a new plot twist or another shoot-em-up-scene? The motivations of all these various groups are weak and thin and improbable. Trying to keep it all straight is difficult, made more so by that fact that each is just a thin veneer for a plot twist. After a while you no longer care. For those interested in the general plot, a much better alternative would be Robert Harris's ""Fatherland."""
1,"Tastes great, but has toxic MSG in it!","Had to quit buying this once I discovered it contained MSG (Monosodium Glutamate). So sad. Loved this dip, why do they have to make it so bad for you?"
3,Hard to Decide,"Nifft the Lean comprises four novelettes featuring Nifft, a gaunt thief. That Nifft is a 'gaunt thief' is all we really ever learn about him, as the stories aren't really about Nifft, but the places he visits. Each of the four stories are exceedingly visual, with a dash of Hollywood over-the-top flair. Shea had several locations and a few cool things he wanted to show us: the underworld and how it operates (twice), a monster-infested swamp, and two giants - one dead and one reawakening. Unfortunately, the frame of stories around them were simple, if not weak. Where Shea excels is the writing itself, which was beautifully said and exceptionally vivid. In the two underworld stories, Shea leans heavily toward the grotesque. Nifft the Lean is not a serious book, nor does it pretend to be, but it's not exactly light reading either."
4,Overkill- Emotionally Shocking,"I thought the book was well written in respect to the dead and their family. As I was reading it I found it depressing but it also struck a curiousity and desire to know what causes people to commit such awful acts of violence. The details of the story were all carefully included as evident by the elaborate style of writing. At points I lost interest but this was due to not being familiar with law and order content. Other then that I thought the characterization was unbiased and truthful. I would overall recommend this book to a true crime reader because it creates the same eagerness to know the identity of the guilty party as any fictional mystery, yet at the same time involves compassion for the families who suffer. Personally, when reading the families' reactions to the crimes I was nearly in tears."
4,For Mrs. Pittman's Class,"In my opinion, this was a very well written book.It was very interesting and thoughly detailed.I love the way Lyn Riddle got every minor detail possible to help visualize the Amish community and the love and support they showed for Laura's family.This is literally the only non-fiction book anyone has gotten me to read for school that I couldn't put down.Although I could have done without the pictures,I would recommend this book to anyone who cold handle this drawn out murder and trial."
3,no mounting hardware,The speakers are good they sound great but they have no mounting hardware. If you read the discription it is written in a way that makes you think there is mounting hardware. The mounting hardware that is written in the discription is the hardware to mount the wires to the speaker. Glad they put that in the discription and worded it to make me think the speakers came with a way to mount them to the boat. I had to make my own mounts :(
3,Alternative pan,"I bought my CBK-200 at a thrift store for $19 to replace the Oster 5838 I had that wasn't working very well. It was missing only the kneading paddle, so I headed to Amazon to purchase that. While waiting for it to arrive, I took a look at the CBK-200 and my Oster 5838 pans - and surprise, surprise, they were identical! I tried it and sure enough, the Oster pan worked just fine. Looking at the CBK pan, I can see the seal at the bottom which I assume is the source of the grease everyone is reporting when that seal wears out. The Oster pan does not have that seal - I believe the grease is under the pan, rather than inside it in a seal like the CBK's is. So if you are someone who has had to replace the CBK pan once or twice and are tired of dealing with that seal, I recommend the Oster 5838 pan instead."
2,Coating coming off within a month of purchase,"The machine works well, although I'm not crazy about having to figure out which is the ""add-in"" signal as opposed to the ""remove paddle"" signal.The baking pan, however, has already started to shed its interior coating and I've made only five loaves of bread in less than a month. I never scrubbed it with anything more than a sponge, but noticed a bald spot on one of the interior portions that is indented. I am hesitant to use the machine, as I know not to use pans that have a damaged Teflon coating.Machine is practically new. Not happy."
1,Wrong Size Sent,"The pan I received didn't fit my machine, and it was a bit thinner metal than the original. I'm pertty sure they sent me the CBK-100 instead of the CBK-200. Now I'm afraid to order another one but I think I have to bite the bullet and try again."
2,Love it but...,"Ok, and generally when buying replacement parts, everything comes with it. I the pan came quickly but no paddle. I am kind of disappointed in the seller for not actually posting get that there will be no paddle. My husband and I recently relocated to Creech AFB in Las Vegas from Charleston, SC and knowing things were bound to get lost, and my paddle was one of the lost things. I the pans twisty system thingy locked up, and hence the new pan, and but no paddle? Was really looking forward to making bread this weekend but it looks like I have to spend more money on buying a new paddle."
5,A Great Thriller,"Well, what can I say. I am a big Brian Haig fan. I enjoyed this book so much. I look so forward to Mr. Haig's books and I was not disappointed. I love the Sean Drummond character, not only his great sense of humor, but the fact that he makes mistakes, has vulnerabilities just like the rest of us. I think Mr.Haig is up there with Ludlum, Forsyth and Demille, which as far as I'm concerned is really good company. I will be reading his next one too. I hope Drummond will be back, but if not, I still look to any story that Mr. Haig will tell."
2,I really wanted to like this book,Although off to a good start I finally had to put this book down after I was almost half way through. I appreciate humor in suspense thrillers but in this case the main character is so overwhelmingly self-deprecatory it becomes tiresome - the work is entirely tongue in cheek - not really believable. A critical scene in which he meets a Russian spymaster in Moscow is so ludicrous I am left with the feeling the book should be listed in the silly humor department.
3,"First half tedious, second half unbelievable","I loved Secret Sanction and thought I had found a new author in Brain Haig. Unfortunately, this was not what happened. I found the first half of the Kingmaker rather tedious due to the sheer amount of overwhelming information on the background story and characters. Suddenly, the second half kicked in with an unbelievable array of treachery, murder, deception and globe trotting. I love a good spy story, but this one left me wanting....well, a good spy story.I will report that Brian Haig writes very convincing and fun dialog. In this book, it wasn't enough."
3,Heidi's review,"Bronx Masquerade is mostly about students in a classroom sharing their feelings. Throughout the book, each student gets more and more comfortable with sharing their feelings with other people. Many students overcome their conflicts throughout the book. It inspired me to look beneath the shell of anyone I see. People could be happy on the outside and hurting on the inside."
4,Awesome structure,"This book has incredible potential of gaining more awards. The novel is about a class of teenagers in the Bronx, NY. Their English teacher, Mr. Ward, has an idea about how to get the class involved in the subject that they are covering, The Harlem Renaissance. He asks the class to write original poetry and share it with the class on ""Open Mike Friday"". What he gets is teenagers opening up to reveal a side of them that hardly any knew. The book is written in a way that is anything other than ordinary. I highly recommend this to anyone."
4,bronx masquerade,"Bronx Masqerade has a rough surface, but a tender touch to it. The characters that are portrayed in the book know how to catch your attention because you know they are hiding something from you. When you start to read the student's poems, you're actually surprised. Some of these kids hardly ever come out of their judgemental shell, but we get to see what's behind the typical stereotypes. Bronx Masquerade is a great book that shows pride over prejudice."
2,bronx masquerade,"The story I read was Bronx Masquerade, the author is Nikki Grimes. The setting is mainly school in the Bronx, the genre is realistic fiction, and there are 167 in the book. The main character in the story is Tyrone.This book is about a class that wants to do poetry. The story tells about the poems they about wrote their stories and how they got their ideas for their pomes. One of the issue in the story is a girl wants to have a baby so she feels loved. Another issue is Tyrone thinks he doesn't have a future so he doesn't know if he should stay in school or drop out. He thinks he is going to die at a young age and won't have a chance to get a good job and raise a family.I am giving this book 2 star because the book was really hard to understand for me. There were too many people talking at once and too many poems, also the slang made the book hard to understand. I would recommend this book for people in high school or above because it hard to understand for some middle schoolers."
2,"Trust me, you've read this before.","I'll make this as short as possible and get to the point. This book is exactly like those movies where a teacher takes inner city school kids under their wing to learn basketball, math, you name it. Here the plot is just the same, only with poetry. The thing is, the book is so short and there are too many characters that you can't make a connection with the kids, or remember their names. It has all the high school clichés that we are far too familiar with and in the end, they all come together and learn to tolerate their differences through the magic of poetry.Think of it as ""Dead Poets Society"" in the Bronx."
4,Tyrone in the Bronx Masquerade by Peter Ingles,"The character Tyrone in The Bronx Masquerade changes a lot over the couse of the story. In the beginning Tyrone is kind of a stuck up little brat who doesn't want to go to school. He is like the black rapper guy in the class. When they start doing ""Open Mike Fridays"" Tyrone learns to express himself through his peotry and becomes a kind of leader to the class. Tyrone matures a lot over the course of the book. Finally Tyrone speaks in ront of the whole school on a final ""Open Mike Friday"". The Bronx Masquerade shows how people can change when they are able to express themselves."
5,Buy this book it is good and may help keep you from doing bad things someday!,"the book was very good and it had a strong message. the students opened up to each other and weren't afraid to speak their minds. what the teacher did for the students was wonderful and could never be repayed for it. it is a must read book for kids everywhere. the slang was a little overdone, but that didn't change the meaning of the book."
3,Bronx Masquerade,"Bronx MasqueradeBronx Masquerade by Nikki Grimes. This book won the Codetta Scott King Award and its genre is realistic fiction.In this book it has lots of characters like Tyrone, Lupe, Janelle, Tunisia Scott, and trust me there a lot more characters than that!This book takes place at a high school with the kids in Mr. Ward's class. Every Friday they have an open Mike Friday and each kid reads a poem they wrote and the book is stet up in sections or each kid and describes what happening in there lives. After most of the sections there is a poem that that kid read aloud in class.I would recommend this book to anyone that likes to read short stories and likes poetry wrapped in there. Finally, I would this book 3*'s because I am not a fan of poetry and I thought there were to many characters!"
5,"I've never liked reading, but i liked this book","I couldn't believe it...most books i read i end up thinking ""oh it's boring, or it doesn't make sense"" but this book is amazing. It reaches out to teenagers and young readers by sharing experiences that they can relate with...especially to kids who like poetry. Trust me, the second i finished this book i was inspired to write a poem of my own...it's that good.There is one problem though that i almost downgraded the book for...it didn't really flow to a regular storyline...it kind of was a compilation of different kids with different experiences. But nontheless, great book and i'd recommend it to anyone suffering with problems of their own...it's a feel good story, hands down it's worth the read."
4,Bronx Masquerade,"The Bronx Masquerade is basically about 18 students in a high school slowly starting to learn about each other and themselves through poetry. Yes, I know that sounds cheesy, and that's exactly what this books largest downfall is. A horrible, horribly obvious cheesiness that makes you cringe in pain. But! There are good things too. The characters are very well developed, and none are exactly written like each other. Although many of the characters completely change unrealistically fast and easily, the plot is otherwise set at a good pace, and the poetry is well done."
3,Bronx Masquerade is a ok book,"I am a 7th grade literature student at ....... This book was pretty good. The only complaint I would have against this book is that it doesn't have much of a conflict. It also did not excite me that much. Nikki Grimes did a good job of making the characters in this book and their backgrounds. She also made good problems for each character. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes poetry. I would recommend it to people in the 5th through 10th grade range. Tyrone, a boy in this book, used to not like school, is now interested in Open Mike, an event held every Friday where everyone reads their own poems."
2,weightless system,"I bought this tool belt in preparation of retiring from the military and going into business for myself as a carpenter/handyman. the ride was nice and the capacity was great. The problems I encountered included putting it on as the bag pads tend to flip, the grommets on the belt came out, the small bags always dump in the big bag and need riveted to the other bag. Now after 6 weeks of use the stitching is starting to come undone. the system is good but needs the rivets added to the outside pouches and make it easier to put on. More rivets at points that catch a lot of stress would help."
5,Works as advertised.,"This thing is made of awesome. Attach it to your utility sink, put in your roller, turn on the water, and it cleans out all the paint. It spins so fast that most of the water spins out as well.Note that you'll need a utility sink with hose threads on the faucet. If you have an aerator, you'll need something like http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/B002FYIVBO so this will fit. You can also get the adapters for about five bucks at the orange big-box store."
1,It's a mess,"I read the reviews on here and was hopeful. Unless you have a sink like the people who gave this 5 stars, do not buy this. In theory it sounds great, but... First, there is nothing that holds the roller in place while the water is shooting at it. If you just let it hang the water forces the roller against the side and it stops spinning. You have to try to hold the roller in place with one hand while you hold the washer in the other. Second, if you use it in your back yard, especially if you were using white paint, it will leave your grass with paint residue on it for days. I can't say if it kills the grass or not because I used it over a patch of crab grass and didn't really care. I wish I had a sink, or a basement for that matter."
2,Soft but knees go to side,"The concept of Gel in kneepads is good but something must be done about the design so that my knees do not move to the side. Basically no matter what I do, my knees always end up on the side of the pads because of the hard face. What needs to happen is like the older foam type pads. Your knees must be cushioned but also allow the pad to compress under your weight so that your knees do not rotate to the sides. Basically, you use these with your knees never in the middle unless you keep your weight perfectly centered over your knees (legs have to be together). Obviously, you could not work like this."
1,Comfort is where it ends,"I am also a tile setter who decided on these higher priced pads. When your in one place and do not move these pads are fine. However when grouting, setting or even doing wet beds these will not do the job. I find myself almost falling over most of the day. I do not suggest these pads for anyone working on a flat surface. Maybe they'll work for gardening?"
2,to kneel or not,well i just got them this week and they don't stay on the knee cap they keep sliding to the side the cap is verry hard and needs to have a flat spot i thing trhat would help them stay put i HAVE REMOVED THE HARD SHELL AN THEY SEAM TO WORK BETTER.
3,The merit of existing until now...,"Boris Berman plays with Schnittke music. This was until now the only recording available of Sonata No 1 for piano. Watch for Svetlana Ponomareva new release of the same piece. Where Berman is cold, intellectual and barely follows the tempi making this music so much ado about nothing, Ponomareva brings a spiritual depth and shows why this piece is a XX Century classic in the range of the Liszt Sonata in B minor."
1,Heater stopped working 3 weeks after purchase.,"I ordered this heater from Amazon to have a little additional warmth in our home office during the chilly winter months. The heat output was far less than expected, and did not seem able to significantly warm the not terribly large (12x10) space. I was also a little disturbed when the unit was accidentally tipped one night and did NOT turn itself off. Fortunately I was in the room when this happened and no harm was done. The real problem though is the heater simply stopped producing heat after 3 weeks of very light use in one room. The fan would blow, but the coils would not heat, turning the device into a fan, rather than a heater. I'm definitely steering clear of Holmes heaters now while searching for my replacement heater. Not at all recommended."
1,Don't Buy This Heater!,"I bought this heater in Oct and used it very little until it quit working in Dec. I tried contacting the company by Planetfeedback.com and through their website to resolve this issue, but apparently they don't see the need to respond to consumer complaints.I can understand a product being defective, but when a company won't stand behind their products I won't continue to do business with them."
1,Stopped Working,"I can say without reservation that this heater is an absolute piece of trash and a waste of money. My Holmes HRH314 stopped working after two weeks; Holmes obviously has no pride in their products, as this heater is very cheaply made. I severely regret buying this product, as will you."
1,poor heating quality,I purchased two of these heaters awhile back. I found them to be noisy and not really all that effective at heating the childrens bedrooms. I would not buy them again.
2,Choose a different space heater!,"Worked great when was first purchased! However, for after spending a summer in the closet, now the heater shuts off every 10 minutes due to the 'safety' mechanism tripping. I cannot recommend this heater due to its disappointing performance."
2,Not well designed,"I've had this heater for a while (maybe 2 years) and use as an occasional space heater to heat me up in a cold room. This heater is very noisy, making a crackling noise each time it cycles. Also, the thermostat that it uses it more like a thermocouple (in a toaster oven) than a thermostat, where the heater goes full blast for a time and then goes off for a time. Turning the knob doesn't seem to affect this cycle much. It would be much better if it had a way to reduce the current flow through the coils (like low-med-high) and have it stay on. There are no such adjustments. I find myself freezing during the off cycle and burning up during the on cycle. I would not pay anywhere near the retail price on this."
1,this is a dangerous product,i bought two of these in 09 model hrh314 used one in first year and had problems from the get go would come on for a short time (5 min ) max and then shut down didn't matter that it was very cold or hot in house then one of the upper elements came apart creating electrical sparks tossed it and forgot until this year when i used the second one at first worked fine (3 weeks) and same thing happened but this time when element burned out it became attached to inner shielding and was sparking and when i grabbed the unit to disconnect it i suffered an electrical shock i have numerous pics showing last heater which i kept with disattached element which seperated and attached to back shield sparking and am going to pursue legal action
1,Never again,"This heater worked, somewhat, for 3 days then broke.(It made a LOT of noise) The company, when I finally got someone on the phone, told me to return at my expense,unopened in the original package and if they decided that the product was at fault, they would replace it. How in the world can you tell that an electrical product doesn't work if you don't open it? I will not purchase anything else through Amazon and will advise everyone not to also.Linda Nelms"
3,breeding show dogs for dummies,"If you are interested in establishing and breeding your own show line this book is aimed at you. The author is a successful breeder and judge of show dogs. That is his strength as well as his weakness. There is little on working lines, and the author's statement that a mixed breed dog should never be bred shows he knows little about the breeding of the world's fastest sled dogs, the Alaskan husky, a mixed breed by definition. Even though the author bred Rotties, Boxers, and other working breeds, he seems to be devoting this book to people who want to breed for conformation and not for performance outside of the show ring. I almost didn't buy it based on some of the other reviews, which are very negative, but I decided to pick up a used copy for a buck on Amazon, and I am glad I did. There is a lot of good stuff in it. So I give it 3 stars."
3,Very Informative Book,This is an excellent book with a lot of details and valuable information. I would recommend this book to anyone planning on breading your dog.
5,Breeding Dogs for Dummies,"Searching for a viable business, after retirement, I purchased this book and was very glad I did. This provided information to help the decision making process along. The detail is written in a very easy format to understand. If you are considering a business in dog breeding, this is a great way to start the information process."
2,To General and Non-Specific,"This was the least informative book I read in preparing myself for breeding my bitch for the first time. It talks in generalities giving little specific information as to what to look for in breeding readiness, actual breeding behavior and whelping. Don't waste your money on this one!"
2,Good book if you don't want to breed dogs,This book was full of delightful information about why people should not attempt to breed dogs. Not a very helpful book in my mind.
4,Lots to Learn,The imagery and detail presented in this documentary is brilliant. It tells a comprehensive and enlightening tale of the butterfly and is good for all audiences.
2,Descent into nonsense,"This novel intrigued me and drew me in for quite a while. But two thirds of the way through the action became so outlandish that it began to annoy me. By the end (which explains nothing, by the way) I was just pissed off. I can appreciate ambiguity in the plot of a story if the story itself speaks to me emotionally or conveys some meaning. In this case, I just felt I'd been taken for a ride."
2,I would skip it,"Unfortunately, Bob McCorkle isn't the only fake thing in this book.Disturbingly false is Carey's portrayal of artistic genius as supernatural zombie magic, instead of the 90% perspiration that it is.And that even isn't as hollow as the notion that an old Chinese lady in a motorcycle shop in K.L. named Mrs. Lim must be a feral machete psychokiller.Carey's plot is so convoluted that this isn't a spoiler."
1,Listening to Mold Grow Erratically,"First I should state that I have absolutely NO literary pretensions or aspirations. I tried to read Milton in my misspent youth and thought it overwrought. I have read Maugham, although I didn't especially like it. In My Life as a Fake, Carey makes Maugham seem action packed and exciting. At least Maugham had characters with verisimilitude, crashing around the jungle. My best description of this novel is if a film noir heroine were dropped into KL (Kuala Lumpur) in the middle of the Maltese Falcon. There is no resolution, no satisfaction, not even any explanation to wrap things up in the end. We don't even get to read or hear any of the oft lauded ""great poetry"" about which much is eulogized. It all seems Much Ado About Nothing. Stupid literary twit thinks she has the Next Big Thing and doesn't understand that there are people involved who don't really care about Poetry. 9.75 hours of my life (listened to on audio disc) that I sincerely wish I could regain."
4,quircky but engaging style,"A complex, engaging story told from an odd but compelling first person stance. I need to write this review just to rate the product, so please ignore this review."
2,Beware,"This book is clever enough, I suppose, but the characters are of no interest as individuals. For another book which is clever, well written, makes use of Tasmanian history, and has characters I was interested in, I recommend ""English Passengers"" by Matthew Kneale. Note: I only read half of the Carey novel."
5,A good book for fashion entrepreneur,This book was a tutor and major guide for me taking my business from home sewing to cottage sewing. A well written book that cover everything in the industry. Ho! what a guide to keep. It is a blessing for a novice and anyone interested in the clothing industry.
4,"Oooo, I like that last song 'Lay With Me':",But what's with the pink ribbon on the hand grenade?* Seems kinda hinky/kinky to me?Slow and mysterious guitar though.
1,Time to retire Uncle Ted!!!,"As with most of the rockers from times gone past (The Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin etc.), you were great THEN, but the time has come. Loved Uncle Ted when I was 17 (I'm 46 now) but it's time to put down the guitar Uncle Ted !!!"
1,Holy digital fatique!!!!!!,Holy digital fatique !!!!!! This cd goes to the used bin. It's unlistenable. It's pressed to loud.Back to vinyl. STARKER
3,Uncle Ted is back,"You can say what you like about Ted Nugent. Agree or disagree with his political beliefs, one thing is certain...This white boy from Detroit sure can play guitar. This CD offers up more of what you'd expect from the Nuge, scorching guitar and almost laughable lyrics. Personally the highlight for me is the last track, a blues dittie called ""Lay With Me""- it has some classic Nugent six string magic on it.I don't think this CD will bring any new fans to the Nugent camp, but it probably won't disappoint any long time Ted fans either. Ted is what Ted is- over the top, non stop energy. Atleast with Ted you ALWAYS know what you'll get!"
1,Yawn,"Another Ted Nugent offering (ho hum).... complete with borrowed lyrics (from his own past songs).. tired guitar riffs that Joe Walsh played in 1976, and Nugent still voicing the Mick Jagger mannerisms that have plagued most of his attempts at singing. In all fairness, Nugent did sing one song really well in his career, but his version didn't make the album cut. His love song.. ""Heart and Soul"" from Spirit of the Wild was only heard as an outtake on a Detroit radio program and it was indeed soulful and well executed. Too bad Nugent didn't recognize what might have been. This latest batch of jam riffs cum junior high lyrical scatology will be in the bargin bin before you can say Jack Kerouac"
3,Good not great,The GoodThe album has a great grooveTed's guitar solos ( they smoke )Some very solid tracksGreat bassist and drummerThe badSome cheesy tracksTed's guitar solos production ( the solos are way down in the mix )Ted singing
5,A miracle!,"I was present to this concert in Paris where this CD has been recorded live. It was really breathtaking! A great moment of pure music, of pure emotion. Very interesting on the musicologic point of view too, it is amazing to hear Schubert's Lieder adorned with orchestral colours. Do not hesitate, get it right away! This is two of the most magnificent woices of our time and this is... the great ABBADO."
1,Woeful,"Poor Dame Gwyneth is awful in this. Excessively wobbly and ill-focused, and out of tune several times.The opening of Gebet der Elisabeth (Track 2) is woefully out of tune. The ""Ruhe"" in the Immolation Scene is not very even and has a pretty awful droop. The final section has more painful off notes.Sigh..."
5,BIG BANG FOR THE $$$ !!!,"Nice stainless H2O cages seem to be disappearing from the market lately-.....Hmmmmm...-the mfg's must have figured- THEY LAST TOO LONG!!Why is the DELTA INNOX bottle cage a big bang for the buck???APPERANCE-Hi-tech blast finished STAINLESS- LOOKS & FEELS expensive,Arrow shape mocks cages costing much more $$$-impress your riding buddies!DURABILLITY-Bottle fit is too tight or too loose?? Just bend the INNOX to yourspecs, it will take repeated reshaping yet remain durable!!Stainless steel's finish doesn't wear off like anodizedcages-so keeps it's new look LONGER!!PRICE-Considering the above factors, why over pay for a simplebut highly needed component??Really, who NEEDS a $75.00 carbon cage to hold a $12.00 plastic bottle???-Remember, Steel is real, carbon may be chic, but STAINLESS is FOREVER!!!"
3,"sleek, but no screws","This is a lightweight, sleek looking cage. Beware though, as it does not come with any mounting screws. This may not be a problem for some, but is a problem for me as my bike is brand new and I do not have an old cage to take the screws from."
1,memory upgrade 512mb ddr,I'm sorry to say that the very first item I have ever purchased on Amazon did not work. I am very disappointed. I will not shop Amazon again.
1,What?,"Sorry, I couldn't get in to it. I could only make it through the first fifty pages and I just felt lost all the time. Maybe if I stuck with it I might have discovered it's a wonderful book, but time is money and I don't have time to spend on a maybe."
5,LOVE this book/,"I was not expecting to love this book so much, but i did!the two main characters are great, and the plot is fascinating.5 out od 5 stars, for sure!"
1,Awful,"I was shocked at how dry this book was. I have read a lot of sci fi and fantasy books, so I don't need to be spoon fed by any means, but I spent a large part of my time going 'WTF?!' while reading this book. I could have laid it down in the first 20 pages but I pushed on and pushed on in hopes that one of the characters would spark my interest. After 250 pages, I finally realized I was only punishing myself and just gave up. I absolutely love Jacqueline Carey and when I saw her positive review on the front cover of this book I figured it was a slam dunk. No such luck for me. This dry, drab, morose sucker is going to be shipped off to Paperbackswap ASAP."
3,Melusine,"I didn't find the writing style or the storyline to be very engaging. Too melodramatic from the start of the book to have any intrigue left. I rarely put aside a book I have started to read, but I willingly relinquished this one to the book shelf."
3,unusual,"very unusual book where the chief character is not you typical ""hero""some might find him offensivelong start but then the book gets much better. Complicated story plot pay attention as story hints to future books.map would be helpfulnot a story for the very young, if a movie would rate NC 17"
5,Nice,This is a good product but was made poorly because of the padding around the neck so I my self had to move the padding to protector the upper chest and neck......other then that it protect you very well in a game of street Hockey.....so I still give it a 5 star rating....
2,Not Wrist Friendly,"This extremely cute tea pot is hard to lift. The small, round handle only allows a couple of fingers to be inserted, therefore you can't get a good grip and use the full strength of your hand to lift and pour. It is a good teapot, however, for not dripping when you pour, and a nice, heavy lid that stays in place."
3,Another careless job,"It's 2006, we're several volumes into the series, and the authors of this book just couldn't be bothered to proof the English. My Chinese isn't good enough to critique the Hanyu, but the abundance of English typos (even in introductory material!) is a disgrace for an institution like Princeton. Ok, granted, U. of Hawaii is the best US school for Chinese and their books reflect that; but I'm getting tired of writing one review after another of this series of texts pointing out the crude production standards.No translations of the full text. Limited grammar notes. How is this better than just bringing the texts up in Shuhai Wenyuan on the Web and getting a richer glossary there that is easier to use?Overall another disappointment, but of enough utility to give it an average rating of three stars out of 5: a C, maybe a C+."
2,sound is bad,"I was really excited to get this, it is small, looks fantastic, has an input for my Sirius and is only $100. However, at least to my ears, the sound is awful and actually hurts my ears. There's no true equalizer, you can choose from a few presets but none of them sound good. I'm not an audiophile so I can't put my finger on it but I get a headache listening to it, I think it's something with the base or trebble. I'm sort of stuck because I need to return this one but I don't know of another boombox or micro system that is good that I should replace it with....but I can't keep this one it's too bad."
1,Very bad product,I bough this product together whit a Pyle PLA2220 2 Channel 2400 Watt Bridgeable Mosfet Amplifier and this product last just 3 days!!!! totally bad!!! i don't recomend this!!!
1,IT LIT ON FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,YOU LOST THE FIRST ONE I TRIED TO BUY MIND YOU IT WAS THE LAST ONE SO I HAD TO BUY THE DOWNGRADE PUT IT IN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND GUESS WHAT IT WASNT EVEN IN FOR 24 HOURS AND IT STOPPED WORKING LOOKED IN MY TRUNK AND IT WAS SMOKING IN MY BOX.
2,awesome for a bit,i got one of these cause i wanted a little extra bass and wow did i get it. had it hooked up to a 250 watt rms amp to only one voice coil and that was great but then i upgraded to a 1000watt rms amp to bolth voice coils and i will shook windows as i drove by. but after a while it seemed to get quieter and then stopped i took it out and inspected it and saw the voice coil wires were melted and separated.
2,This Sub is only worth $50 dont pay more,Had this guy on an amp that pushes 1000rms to 4ohms and i had this sub wired to 2 ohms with the dvc setup. after a week I noticed a jingling sound from the sub when i got close enough to listen. I put my multimeter on it to check the resistance and I saw 4 ohms. One of the voice coils went out in a week or less. Still played fine until about 3 days later when the other voice coil blew. I'm getting a kicker cvr 15 used off craigslist for $75 this time which should DEFINITELY outlast this POS
3,good subs for a good price,I bought these subs with a 1500 watt mono opti drive amp and a slide port box it hits hard but i think i need a bigger amp great subs for a good price cant beat it but i need more bass
1,pyle is junk!!!! run away scared they suck,They didn't last a week. Pyle warranty sucks. They are not good to deal with buy higher quality product or you will be sorry. I was pushing them with a 1000 watt kicker amp turned up less then half way and smoked these so called 3600 watt speakers!!! What a joke
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,i was sent this sub when soundaround was out of stock of the pld15wd(pyle diver). it took a month and a half to recieve it which was yesterday. the very same day i got it i put it on my kenwood kac-1905d class d 1800 wt. its 500rms at 4 ohms. i played it correcty for 15 MINUTES at 4 ohm and could smell something i took the sub out of the box and it was smoking....i noticed that where the woofer met the magnet it was not sealed together. the cone came out of the magnet. this is my second system and i thought i was making a good decsion getting this sub obviously not. so for those of u looking for a cheap powerful sub DO NOT GET THIS!! for the guy who tried to tell everyone that pyle is garbage u were right.
3,not rated power,if i had to give the rms power rating i probably would say its 800 rms 2000 peak i put a boss 3600 amplifier and hooked it up to 2 ohms so it only got about 2600 max it handled the power very good at first but it slowly burned
1,These are a joke!,"I bought these a week ago, hooked one of them up to a 1000 watt amp and they don't pound, they sound like stock 6x9's. I don't know why. I can say that they aren't 1400 watts and to anyone thinking about purchasing, DON'T. spend an extra 20 or 30 dollars and get some kickers or a real name brand.!"
3,PYLE PLCHW10 10-Inch 1400 Watt DVC Subwoofer,"its ok sounds good inside truck but outside no good sounds like crap, my lighting audio 10in sub thumped so hard u could hear it a half block away . it was allsome it handled a 250 watt lighting audio amp tell i blew the speaker up .."
4,I will get more,I plan on buying more I am a big fan of the subs that Pyle make I will be needing an amp pretty seen look out Pyle audio here I come please don't disappoint me
5,Classic Cartoon,"I agree with Mr.Pickett! I have loved Bravestarr from Day 1 and await the DVD release. This hero is engaging, fun, has a quirky sense of humor, and a horse with a smart mouth. You can't get any better than this."
5,A great fantasy Tale - A Must read!,"What a wonderfull Book!A truly great fantasy story, I read it years agoas a child, and It's great coming back. There are so many layers to this story it's amazing. It's really a must for our time.The tale speaks of Momo - a Nice little girl, that knew how to listen (If you think you know too, read the book...) And has to save the city from the Time stealing men in Grey. The whole idea of Time in this story is lovely...Just go on, and read it!"
5,"A wonderful book for young and all, beautifully written","Momo has a talent, she can listen. This book tells the story of a little girl, that all of a sudden appears in an old amphitheatre - nobody knows how she got there - but something bad happ[ens, the friends that had time for her now don't come to see her anymore, don't come to talk to her - she finds out why - this is the story about momo, her friends and the grey man that steal the time - and Momo's try to rescue them. This book should be read by all those that never take a minute for themself"
5,Simply a magical book,"Michael Ende is for me one of the most amazing authors.Although he is known internationally mostly for The Neverending Story (a must READ, the movie hardly does it any justice) he has written several truly great books this being one of them.What appears on first sight to be just a nice story for children turns into a veritable well of wisdom upon reflection.Especially in our modern culture where children have been discovered and aggressively targeted as a consumer group this book is more up to date than ever.My recommendation is to read it out loud to your kids or to each other at home or during a long drive in the car."
5,Great Book for Kids and Adults,"This book,Written by Michael Ende who was born in Germany and now lives in Italy, Is a beautyful story. I read the book in one session.I would recommend it to my friends and family"
5,Words for Everyone,"An intricate story with a hidden satire on the birth of the fast-paced, all business society, told threw the eyes of orphan Momo, who loves her friends as her only family, she follows a turtle past the reaches of time to figure out why her friends do not come to talk to her anymore. This book is about time--stolen and hidden from people in constant motion, the dreams they had, and the gigantic love of one little girl. Micheal Ende magically weaved a subtle wit, humor, bravery, friendship, love and loss all together and created a story that I could not put down until I read it all the way through. Any generation can learn from this book--all you need is to take a bit of time!"
5,Time to Read,"Momo is an interesting commentary on society, with the aid of some grey gentleman, a tortoise who can communicate in an interesting fashion, a wise elderly man, a roadsweeper, a young storyteller and a little girl who appears from nowhere. I loved all of the characters, especially Momo - You'll want to sweep her up and adopt her! The little comments on daily life and work will make you stop and think. Anyone who is fascinated with the concept of time and/or loves The Neverending Story - READ. THIS. BOOK."
5,Love this book,I've always loved this book. I bought this because it was a first edition and it's beautiful. The illustrations are great and of course the plot is genius. I read this in Spanish a long time ago and i remember why I like it so much.
5,Funny Movie,"Interesting way of seeing monetary value. Sometimes funny, but could have been much much better if the jokes weren't too childish."
1,not as good as when women had tails,"Some of the ideas for the characters comes from the first movie, but this wholemovie is done on a movie set and is good to look at for a few minutes but getbogged down real fast. Even the main actress is not in the movie all the time, itsmostly about the dumb cavemen and how another takes avantage of their stupidity.Dont buy....rent it if possible."
1,When women lost theit Tails,A lot less funny than the earlier movie about women with tails. The systematic exploitation and shortchanging of the cavemen wore thin in 40 minutes and was no longer funny.
1,the road to mental institution,If you manage to watch this nonsense on purpose something wrong with you but if you accidentally bought it hoping for tails leftover I tell you this movie suck.
2,not good enough,"Sorry, everyone thinks the ""lifetime"" warranty is worth the money. I didnt have any luck with that. and maby luck was the key?"
2,"The leather's nice but goddam, it's uncomfortable","For the first week of wearing this sandal the center toe-holder (the one that falls between the big-toe and second toe) chafed and destroyed my feet. It did not align my foot correctly along the sole so my heel would often hang over the inner side of it. My roommate told me, ""oh yeah, the toe-holder wears in after a while and the alignment works itself out.""I've been wearing them now for about six months now, and they've improved to a degree. I definitely won't buy another pair of them.Summary: Overpriced, stylish, and uncomfortable."
2,Good for the normal foot,"The sandal is good for the normal male's foot. My son has a very thick foot and the toe thong and the straps were very, very tight."
1,Horrible Customer Service,"Rainbow has the worse customer service. Don't be fooled by their warranty BS. They are overpriced and uncomfortable and requires a long time to break-in. And by the time you break-in, they are all worn out and warranty is gone. I rather buy some reefs."
2,Painful break-in period,"Buyer beware. There is quite a protracted ""break-in"" period before the sandals feel even remotely comfortable enough to wear. They offer arch support over standard sandals."
5,Like the double layer soles,I ordered these but was unsure about the double layer soles. My older Rainbows were those flat ones. I really liked them but now I'm sold on this type sole. It makes for a better support and that's what I really like. I'm a Rainbow fan and would still purchase the flat style if that's all they had. True to size and very pleased with the purchase.
3,Very painful break in period,These are super premium sandals that are highly sought after and fashion forward. They look great with everything. One huge problem though is that the break in period is going on 3 days now and shows no signs of abating. I'm talking serious pain. The leather straps just tore up my feet to the point that I can't wear these anymore for awhile. Cool sandals shouldn't hurt so much.
4,great flip flops - 2nd pair!,"bought these 5 years ago and it was time for a new pair. i went for the same exact color! not only are these comfy (the arch support is nice!), you can dress them up or down. typical summer prep wear. highly recommended over havaianas which are cheap and provide no arch support. only gets 4 stars because i have wide feet and there is a break in period which i forgot about. i know that sounds ridiculous for flip flops but i remember having this problem with my last pair and kept those for literally 5 years."
1,Couldn't wait for the tightness to go away,I read all the reviews. I know there was an extended break in period on these. But I ordered these the same time as some Reefs and the Reefs fit instantly out of the box. The strap on these were super tight and even wearing around the house was uncomfortable. So I returned them.. Being $59 made the decision easier to return as well. Oh and they there is no free return shipping from these guys.. I had to pay $10 to ship myself.
2,order two sizes biger than you need,Rainbow Sandals Mens Double Layer Premier Leatherif you order these sandals you need to order at least two sizes bigger than you need.the color is also off black is really dark gray.
2,size chart is way off.,"I suppose they are comfortable, but I recommend going to a retailer where you can try them on first. I got the recommended size based on their sizing charts and ended up with a short end of the stick."
5,Most comfortable shoes ever.,"Yes the insides of my toes were actually bleeding in the beginning but this is my 4th pair and after break in I wouldn't trade them for anything, these things last forever too"
4,Rainbow sandals,"The product is great -- my second pair. When they break in and mold to your feet, they are extremely comfortable. The sizing isn't perfect. The 8.5-9.5 barely fits a size 9 and feels small. The 9.5-10.5 is more comfortable, but looks a little too big. If in doubt, go with the larger sizing."
1,Terrible,"I really really tried to like these. I wore them for days, I stood in salt water, I tried everything people suggested but these are the most uncomfortable sandals I have ever touched. Maybe people see these like some kind of cave man rite of passage. You endure weeks of blisters and sore feet to break in these awful things to prove you are a real man..."
5,you get what you pay for!,"My wife for a month tried to convince me not to buy these sandals. As a man, you only wear 1 pair of sandals. She owns at least 30 pairs in different colors, styles and the like, Old Navy, Gap, Havianna I could keep going, but I digress. I bought a pair when I went to Cali a few years ago, she called them dingy and made me get rid of them, I regret it! I finally insisted on buying these. They are the best sandals hands down. don't let the price sway you. these will become your every day sandal. they have superior craftsmanship and are made of very durable leather material. The sole is very durable and can withstand day to day walks on concrete sidewalks. I wear them religiously throughout the summer months. invest in a pair and I promise you'll be back for another in a few years when they need replacing."
5,Rainbow FlipFlops,"This my son's second pair of rainbows. He says that they are a bit difficult to break-in at first, but when they are broken in they are the most comfortable ""flops"" that he has worn."
1,Horrible Customer Service,Beware of customer service for rainbow sandals! Shop elsewhere where customer service and policies are better. Would not return a gift my wife bought me even though I had original receipt. They require the same credit card used to purchase to process the return. So don't ever think of buying a gift here for someone as it will be impossible for them to return. They tried to tell me they have good cutsomer service...not! I went from this store to Jack's Surfshop and Nordstrom and had no problems with returns my wife had purchased. Maybe they should take some lessons from these more customer friendly stores. I also prefer OluKai Sandals. Give them a try so you don't have to shop here and save yourself the hassle!
5,Huge Rainbow Fan,"I've bought Rainbows since I was a freshman in college. They're the quintessential college flip flop, so I felt it necessary to buy a pair for my brother who was starting out at FSU. So far, he loves them, and this kid does NOT like to wear flip flops. Great product!"
5,Durable but a little tough to break in,"I have rainbows myself and as a girl, I can stand pain for fashion. My fiance however is another story. He says they are comfy but he can't stand the breaking in process. They were really tight at first and gave him blisters from wearing the sandals too long. But now he loves his rainbows!"
3,A screwdriver that is not a screwdriver,"After purchasing this screwdriver @$111+, I discovered it is not a screwdriver. It lacks the driver bit and you have to send to the company to get it. We could not find one to fit locally because it takes a longer shank than any we could find. The driver bit cost us $10.90 plus $5 because we didn't have a $30 order from Milwaukee and also S&H on top of that. It would have cost us $13 to return it to amazon where we purchased. For those prices we could have bought a screwdriver that was a screwdriver."
2,Large Print according to who?,"I am not going to attempt to review its literary, theological or organizational format. This review is focusing on one thing only-LARGE PRINT! I DON'T THINK SO. If you are looking for a concordance that is larger print, this is not for you. I still have to use my glasses and sometimes, I have to use a stronger pair. AGAIN....what it says is not my review but if you are looking for a large print concordance. place close attention to the words,""larger print."" which it is not."
3,Lacks what older Strong's have.,Be CAREFUL of the words updated. New isn't always the best. I'm now going back to buy an older version with Hebrew - Chaldee additions.
3,Good Reference Tool but . . .,"This is a great reference tool with its Greek and Hebrew dictionaries and its topical reference system, but mine is missing pages. With 1853 pages, it's hard to tell exactly how many are missing, but I recently discovered pages 623-638 are not there. And, of course, those pages contained the information I was seeking. I've had the book too long to return it now. Sorry to throw a negative note in with all the positive reviews, but, hey, the book is missing some pages."
5,Deeper Understanding for KJV Users,"Concordances are helpful for getting a clarification or connotation on a word and for doing scripture-to-scripture comparison of word usage. For example, if you look up the word ""blessed,"" the concordance reveals that it doesn't always mean the same thing, and through a numbering system directs you to Hebrew and Greek sections that reveal connotations and more. But, concordances correspond to versions, so if you use a NIV or NASB version, for example, this Strongest Strong's will not work for you. But for KJV users, this is the best concordance I've seen. True the print is small compared to a novel, but relative to other concordances, it's large and clear. Besides the better print, accuracy, and comprehensiveness, what gives this concordance a bit extra is the Nave's Topical Index at the end, which is complete but unlike a bulky separate Nave's volume, it saves space by just citing the verses instead of quoting them."
5,Excellent,Excellent source for searching the scriptures. Very easy to use and would recommend it to all who are serious about learning more.
3,A Really Fine Reference,"I cannot imagine what is not in this book. I am a new Christian and I am a LOT overwhelmed as yet, but I felt I should get the best references I could. THIS IS IT! There is only one small (he-he) problem! The LARGE,easy to read print is miniscule! I almost need a magnifying glass. The book is a lovely, well-made and totally comprehensive reference asset and the price is very reasonable. I can see myself using it the rest of my life. Unlike most things, the Scriptures do not change from year to year."
1,Visually Unappealing,"My husband purchased a Strong Concordance about 10 years ago and I loved it. Visually, the print was a nice size and it flowed. It was a strong tool that aided me tremendouosly in my bible reading/study. I can't imagine trying to study the bible without this helpful reference tool. With that being said, I eventally needed to order one for myself and after months of reading back and forth the various Strong's that Amazon offer, I chose this one. I could not wait to get it, but was so disappointed when I did. It is extremely packed with too much information with too small a print on each page, so that from a visual standpoint, it is like walking into a hoarder's home. It was just too much and because each page is so jammed pack with such small print, it is just hard to know where to land the eye, where to begin. I just put it down and felt so bad, so disappointed because I have always wanted one and to finally purchase one and get one like this was a tremendous disappointment."
2,Keep the old,"The concordance, I must say, was in new condition. However, the print was especially tiny and I don't like the fact that the updates were made for today's times. We should not change the meaning of something because that is how we practice it today. I will go back to the older version."
3,Hard on the eyes,I received this concordance on 7/5/06 and I found it to be very informative. My true gripe with this edition is that it is very hard on the eyes. People with less than 20/20 vision will probably have a hard time viewing it. I plan to wait until they come out with a larger letter edition and repurchase it at that time.
1,NOT Recommened,"I thought this was a good Strong's until I went to look up a word and knew immediately that Mr. R. Kohlenberger and James Swanson had changed the number for a word that needed not be changed. So having one word that referred me to the wrong number in the Hebrew there is no way I would trust using this Strong's to do my studies. I have been a Bible student for many years, so I knew better when I saw this BIG mistake, but for a new student, they would never know the difference. So this is why I do not recommend this book. Get a different Strong's, preferable one that is unabridged and complete. If you can get the older ones, do so. Now I did like haveing the Nave's in this book and the other features, but you can get them seperatly."
3,Shipping awesome but my order not so,"Shipping awesome very much satisfied with the product except the packaging, my book arrive with lots of creases , got a littlebit of a dog ear at each end of the edges of the cover, considering that these is new, it arrives inside an envelope with air bubbles that protects the book but it is not enough, maybe during the process of delivery that causes this thing, aside fromthese all pages are good, this is the book I am looking for. Maybe next time please consider the packaging carefully. No planto return it, and will keep it."
1,Very poor rating,"very unhappy with the Srongest Strong's Concordancethe print is so small I cannot read it. I wish I had known in advance that this product was so inferior. I am a senior and thought this would be like other Strong's Concordances, so imagine my disappointment when I received it. It just sits here doing nothing.Is there any way I could receive your regular Strong's Concordance? My Dad has one and it is great. However, since I already paid for this one, I refuse to pay again. Plus it would cost me a fortune to return it.Can you help?Thank you.Bonnie Johnson"
5,Ab Fab!,"I love this concordance! I have been able to find verses in the bible with this exhaustive concordance from strong when I haven't been able to find them in a regular bible concordance. It is very frustrating when you know a verse in the bible and you forget where it was and you spend countless hours trying to find it well this concordance has helped me find those verses, and not to mention the other great features this book has!! This is a study tool that everyone who is passionate about god's word should have!!!"
2,not what I expected from poroduct,This wasn't what I needed. It was too revised for the purpose of my class and couldn't do the research requested.
5,Essential for Chemical Engineers,"I've been using Henry Kister's books since long time. Started as a master student and now at work. Every time I used it I ended up with a solution or at least hints for my problems. Distillation Operation is an essential book if you consider work on distillation and/or absorption. It is essential because provides knowledge based on experience in operation, points out on common operational and design mistakes and help troubleshooting. Book's structure is very easy to follow and has got a wide range of references and good real examples. If you look for more fundamental design rules I'd recommend combine this one with Henry's Distillation Design."
4,Speed Buggy car & women power,"Comparable to Scooby Doo Where are you?, but with a car. Enjoyable & pro womans lib .A strong female character.Worth purchasing for Hanna Barbera animation collecters."
2,not too happy,There was a cd missing from the order. And I have found out the software does not work well with windows xp very well. All in all I am NOT happy with the results.
3,Difficult update path,Good product but purchasers need to be careful about product updates. In their earlier editions NG did not maintain the updates in the market for very long. Individuals interested in keeping their collection up to date may end up needing to repurchase the entire collection to fill in a one year gap. Given the low cost of reproducing CDs this is not easily understandable.
1,terrible quality,"I am a great fan of National Geographic, partly because of its outstanding quality in prints. This ""digital"" version was very poorly made: the text and the pictures are all fuzzy. Sometimes the words are barely legible. Reading an article of more than 10 pages is very painful. I would love to see this library completely remade."
3,Carving the Camel,"The title of this book should actually be, ""Carving the Camel."" The book does an excellent job of walking you through the steps of carving a camel. It does not, however, give you step by step instructions on any of the other animals of the nativity. There is a gallery of photos showing finished donkeys and sheep, but the actual patterns are side profiles only--not front or rear profiles . . . something essential for most beginners. Over all, the book is great for what instructions it provides, but fails to live up to its title."
4,"Good, standard jazz","Worth buying, particularly if you're a rabid TLC fan. She should stay away from vocals, though IMHO..."
4,I can't complain,"For the money this is an alright kit. Everything functions well however it probably isn't durable enough for heavy use. The rope is only 1/2 or 5/8 thick and the harness is very basic. I would not recommend for someone that will be using this on a full time basis. For occasional use, or as a backup system this is a great product though. If you are going to be using a harness more than a few times a month do yourself a favor and buy something a little nicer."
3,MSD Spark Plug Wire Set,"Not at all what was shown in the picture. Even the color was different. Needed a straight boot, angle boots were substituted. Can Not use. A waste of money."
3,INSPIRED ENERGETIC NIGHT,"four stars INSPIRED ENERGETIC NIGHT.HOT PERFORMANCES WITH INCREDIBLE LITTLE TWISTS, LIKE ON SOUTH SIDE OF THE SKY, WERE WAKEMAN AND HOWE DUEL HEAVILY,AND YOU AND I HAS BEAUTIFUL WAKEMAN TOUCHES, HE PLAYS TWO TRACKS FROM MAGNIFICATION, ADDING HIS OWN.STEVE HOWE IS PLAYING WELL AND MOVING ON THIS ONE¡ IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT IN THE OLD TIMES STEVE WAS A GREAT STAGE PERFORMEr, JUST WATCH THE QPR DVD AND HE WILL BLOW YOUR UNDERWEAR OFF IN SECONDS, OR YESSONGS. ON LATER DVD'S OF YES HE GOT STIFFER.WHAT CAN I SAY OF CHRIS SQUIRE GOD BASS PLAYING?ONE OF THE BEST YES LIVE CDSTHE DVD HAS SEVERAL AUDIO DROPOUTS THAT PUT YOU OFF SEVERELY. stay away from it"
3,From the back cover:,"Paris O'Hara is trying to find herself, and her hometown of Maple Hill is where she is starting the search. It turns out her mother lied to her about who her father really is, and Paris needs to know the truth. Until she comes to terms with her past, she can't allow herself to get involved with anyone.Paris tries to keep Randy Sanford at arm's length, but she can't resist turning to him when she finally finds what she's been looking for. As she struggles to accept her newfound knowledge, Paris also has to learn that the past is not nearly as important as the future.Emotional, exciting and unexpected!"
3,"Pretty, but pretty useless","I thought this teapot would be a great addition to my Fiesta collection - I bought it in cobalt. It looks great on display, and I've occasionally used it to hold flowers, but it is virtually worthless as a teapot. The pour spout causes tea to run down the side of the pot and tea pretty much goes everywhere but in the teacup. Only buy this if you're looking for a collectible - if you're looking for a good teapot for tea, look elsewhere."
3,Keep it down!,"Maybe it's just my warped sense of humour, but I couldn't help finding this book quite funny. Once I realized that Stephen Day was going to somehow screw-up his misplaced murderous vigilantism, I couldn't get enough of it. It is definitely a dark tale that spirals down quickly and never sees the light of day again. I thought the subject of noise sensitivity was handled quite nicely and hope to read more of Carol Anne Davis' work in the future."
3,wet dreams of bud by darwin porter,"there was not one shred of documentation in the entire book to substantiate any of the author's fanciful account of marlon brando. what he did was to weave a tale using his fantasies about the late actor & the other people in his life who were unable to defend themselves against mr porter's accusations mixed in with so-called ""common knowledge"" about them. while some of these episodes may be based on fact, again, there was no documentation of any of these alleged escapades, which other authors are responsible enough to cite. while some people are satisfied by reading total sensationalism, a la the enquirer, until mr porter learns about factual reporting, this book is nothing more than a glorified one-hander."
1,Outrageous Claims !,"What an outlandish piece of tripe !!! No proof, no references, nothing but 'she said/he said'. To be sure; Marlon Brando was a 'stud' - But, to make such outrageous claims without REAL/VERIFIABLE PROOF...is slander !!! I REALLY hope Mr. Brando's estate sues Porter over this. Pathetic."
3,Tabloid Materials Amplified...,"Mr Darwin Porter's account of the events of Marlon Brando's life may contain some inchoate truths, but the book reads more like a long tabloid paper than a true biography. I find many of the supposed dialogues between individuals as unbelievable. And since Porter never consistently references his sources, you never know which information is reliable and which is tabloid and gossips.Disappointing as a biography, but great as gossip book."
2,Needs a copy editor and designer,"The book is filled with typos and very poorly laid out, which damages the credibility and visual appeal of the book. (My previous review pointing this out was deleted for some reason).It's hard to know exactly who this book is meant for--and it's no wonder it wasn't picked up by a major publishing house. The stories, even if all of them are true, need an editor and are so poorly written that the book is often unreadable."
4,OMIGOD! Unzipped and Pants Down,"If all of this novel is to be believed I am wondering where Mr. ""I Can't Keep My Pants Up"" Brando had time to make any movies at all. Marlon went to bed with half of the world according to this tale of unbridled sex with men and women. The loves of his life is said to be his mother, Dodie, and Wally Cox. There is a hint of incest with his mother in the book. He was bisexual to say the least and made no bones about it - early in life affairs with James Dean, Monty Clift, Burt Lancaster, Rock Hudson and on and on. Too many men and women to name. It is a side of Brando that has not been written about. If you want to know every little detail of his sex life and who sampled his ""noble tool"" as he called his package, then read the book."
3,Not worth the money compared to the Oxo Salad Spinner,"While I am a huge fan of Tupperware, this product is sort of dissapointing. If I had never used an OXO Salad Spinner with an easy press-down button I would've been much more impressed with this. However, it take quite a bit of arm power to turn the knob and once you get it going it's hard to keep the container from sliding around the counter. The good side is that it can be used in the fridge with the included lid and can be used to store grapes and other fruit as well. If you can get this for under $20, I would purchase it. Otherwise, go for the Oxo Salad Spinner - cheaper, same quality, and a heck of a lot easier to use!"
4,Lots of heat,"I've had this heater for 2 years, and I think it's great. A little noisy perhaps, but I'll take it for the great heat output. Not all 1500 watt heaters are alike! This one kicks out lots of hot air, and it's really compact. I've tried several others, and they are heat wimps by comparison! Great value."
3,Neutrogena-grapefruit scent,"I'm accustomed to buying the original, iinstead I received 40-oz a Grapefruit scent and I'm allergic to citrus products! The service was excellent as always, came in no time at all. Guess I'll have to be more specific next time huh? At that excellent price; I wouldn't consider returning it so my neice is enjoying it now!"
5,An old friend found,"On a trip to Germany in August, our hotel had complimentary Neutrogena products in the bath. I was surprised to find it after so many years of using other products and having forgotten my once favorite soap of choice. I love its smell...not floral, not artifically spice, Just neutrogena. It made my skin feel great. My hotel samples are now empty, so Here I am today having found it on Amazon and ordering it now."
2,Disappointed!!,"I used this shower gel at a friend's place and really liked it. So, I ordered it a few days ago and got it only yesterday. However, when I opened the package, I was surprised to find the product was leaking from inside the bottle. The squeezer was not properly locked I guess. This caused about a quarter of the product being leaked and wasted which is a big disappointment. The product is great otherwise.I regularly order a number of products from Amazon and have really been happy with their service so far. But, I must say, I am not much impressed this time around."
2,Not recommended,"Might seem good at first, but beware. Its not very fruity smelling also its a big bottle that never gets over"
5,"the scent had me at ""hello"", the 40oz size kept me there.....","Neutrogena Rainbath has been my favorite shower gel for well over ten years. The scent is fantastic - a sort of subtle woodsy scent that makes me feel both calm and energized at the same time. Very gentle on my skin and never dries me out; leaves me feeling clean with not a hint of residue, even with my hard water.Definite beauty Hall of Fame perfect product status found here.... highly recommended!"
3,I have been washing with the Neutrogena Rainbath ...,"I have been washing with the Neutrogena Rainbath for a week now, and I love the scent. However, it just doesn't lather up enough. Too much water in the product I guess. You have to use about five squirts to wash. I tried using a body pouf, and it didn't even make any lather. Overall, a nice product, and it left my skin feeling very smooth and fresh."
3,Not hypo-allergenic like the Neutrogena bar soap!,"One of the principal ingredients is Sodium Laureth Sulfate, a known skin irritant, which is noted in many articles from reputable organizations easily found on the web. Neutrogena bar soap is famously free of such irritants, and consumers may be inclined to trust the Rainbath Gel because it shares the Neutrogena name. So, buy it if you like it, but don't buy it if you are looking for a non-irritating soap to use in the shower!"
4,I love the size of the bottle and ...,"I love the size of the bottle and its bottle shape. It would be something nice to include in a gift basket. I used it as a bubble bath and as a shower gel. As a bubble bath, it foamed nicely, but unfortunately the bath did not fill with bubbles, and the bubbles did not last long. (Perhaps I didn't use enough.) As a shower gel, this product is terrific. It lathered nicely on my bath pouf, and didn't dry out my skin. Lastly, but very important, I found the scent to be more of a masculine perfume. It actually reminded me a lot of my grandfather's after shave (Brute). My husband described the scent as being similar to Lever 2000. Although the perfume is pleasant, I prefer a gentler, more flowery smell. Since it's called """"Rainbath"""" I think a bluish or clear color would have been more psychologically pleasing. Overall, I am happy with the product quality and quantity. I have always been happy with Neutrogena products."
3,needs better description,"When I ordered this product I was expecting the regular version. Nothing in the title describes that it's the grapefruit version. Other than that, it was delivered very promptly and I haven't used it yet but am sure that I will like this product since I love the one I originally thought I was ordering."
3,"This product has a strong scent -- sweet, ...","This product has a strong scent -- sweet, flowery, and spicy, which lingered on my skin. Since I tend to prefer less sweet, fruitier scents, I found this product's scent a big turn-off. That aside, I really liked the packaging -- pump vs. squeeze bottle. The shower gel lathers up very well, and I definitely felt clean after using it. My husband's also using the product, and he really likes it. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys its scent. It's just not for me."
3,2 different products under the same name!,"We have been Neutrogena ""rainbath"" consumers for years. I started to order it online via Amazon Sept. 8th 2010 and I received the right product (the dark, honey colored soap). Then I ordered the same exact product again on Jan. 19th 2011 and they sent me the ""grapefruit"" soap, which is lighter and smells totally different but it's in the same packaging. I am not happy about this and I will not order this product again until the information is clearly marked so we know what we are ordering. The product info needs clarification."
5,Great product,"Order this product twice. Once for myself and I absolutely love the smell, the brand, and the way it makes me feel (clean). Then my daughter kept using my bottle, so I ordered her one too. This is a life-long product for me and shipped fast from seller."
5,"Great product, lasts forever","I have been using this for years. It is both mild and economical. I'm glad that it's available in the large size, which saves on packaging reorders."
5,So soothing,"I am really satisfied with this shower gel. The large size will last for a long time, and I love the scent. It's very natural and relaxing."
4,I liked the way the Rainbath Shower Gel ...,"I liked the way the Rainbath Shower Gel cleaned my skin, but didn't love the smell of it -- it wasn't bad, just unique, and not typical of a shower gel (like a floral or fruity smell you typically get). I did like the pump dispenser because this made it very convenient to use."
3,HorseWatching- For The Inexperienced Horse Person,"In ""Horse Watching"" Desmond Morris explains in adequate detail some of the lesser thought aspects when it comes to horses. Such questions as ""Why does a horse whinny?"" are answered in this injustly named book. When you read the front cover, the critics and publishers give Morris far too much credit for a book suitable for 8-12 year olds. Yes, this book is fantastic for the new equestrian, but no, for the older and/or more experienced person, this book wouldn't be of much help.Because of the fact Desmond Morris has written so many books about various animals, it indicates that he most likely has no or limited experience with horses, and textbooks and research filled the pages, not actual experience and raw knowledge.Thanks for reading my review!Yours Truly,AnnaThe Equestrian Critique :)"
2,Desmond Morris should stick to dogs.,"Desmond Morris' insights and comments on horse behavior are written from the stand point of someone who has limited contact with horses, and who has ridden little, if ever."
5,I own it and love it.,It was given tio me on my 12th birthday. I simply love it. I've read it several times getting something different every time.
3,A beginners' guide to body language.,"Desmond Morris, Horsewatching (Crown, 1988)Morris turns the method of Catwatching to horses, addressing a number of common trivia questions about horses with short, easy-to-understand passages. If you're a horse fan, but don't actually know much about horses and their history, there's a great deal of information to be gathered here. Horse nuts, on the other hand, are likely to find a good amount of material in here of which they're already aware. In other words, how much you like the book is likely entirely dependent on how familiar you already are with its subject. ***"
5,Very Informative,This book had been recommended by a friend. Loads of horse related information which I never knew.In excellent condition.
1,Tweezerman nail clipper Model # 3085-R,"I bought this item largely because it said it was made in USA. People can talk about components of some things coming from abroad, but bottom line - it is not made in USA! It is imported from Asia. Totally disappointed and P.O.ed in being misled! It's going back to where it came from!"
1,Unreliable reader due to broken connector pins,"The idea is good. The tranfer speed is fast. But CompactFlash memory card by itself is not really designed for multiple plug-and-play. The alignment of CF card to the reader is always tricky. After using it for about two months, a connector pin inside the reader was bent and eventually broken, making the reader unusable. Otherwise it would have been a good product."
3,Suggestion for use of all memory card readers,"I would squirt a couple of drops of WD-40 on the pins, no harm's done as WD-40 is electrically-friendly and reduces friction a lot. This will reduce undue stress on the pins from constant pull 'n push and make the reader last longer.In my case, the USB connection on my Nikon CoolPix 5K is more robust than most USB connectors on digital cameras. So I use it and leave the CF card inside the camera all the time unless I really need to swap out the 256 or 512 mb cards when it's full (which is seldom). Or to show off the card to prospective digital camera buyers."
3,BOMBA & THE LOST VOLCANO,"This is quite rare. Good story etc.Quality is quite good.Though when you unseal the package,its actually a DVD-R.Overall a bit pricy,but the only Bomba movie available.Recomended."
2,Roll for Transporting Knives,"This product is very awkward and difficult to use. The pockets are too small. Placing the knife blades into the pockets results in cutting the fabric, and placing the handles in the pockets defeats the purpose."
4,great book,this is a good book. My family is from Camden so having a book that deals directly with where we come from is great.
5,THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE,"I strongly believe that James Fenimore Cooper belongs to the American and the world history. I learned the history reading his books. I have all of them and I still open them once in a while even now, forty years later."
4,"4 stars for symphony, Gayaneh excerpts not rated","From all three available recordigns of Khachaturian's Symphony No.2, I would rank this one between No#1 (Khachaturian/VPO) and No#3 (Tjerknavorjan/Armenian PO). But due to terrible, unacceptably poor sound quality of Decca VPO recording, many people will choose slightly worse interpretation with Jarvi, instead of ultimate, but badly recorded Khachaturian's own one. Anyway, this recording of the symphony is good.Few excerpts from Gayaneh are not good, honestly - they are performed really messily (sorry to say this) - so I am not rating it with any stars. For this composition, I'd strongly recommend you Temirkanov with Royal Philharmonic, they are unbeatable."
4,Excellent value,"I set this up as a secondary home theatre system in my home. Although not as detailed as my main system, I was very surprised by the sound quality for the price. Excellent for movies, but a bit harsh for pure music listening for my tastes. The Sub could be a little more refined, but it is adjustable.If you are looking for decent movie sound on a limited budget, I don't think you can go wrong here."
4,Works great,I found the CenDyne easy to use and fast at writing. I am able to use it on all my computers with no problem and have found it to be a convenient way to burn.
1,Disrespectful to Christianity,Making fun of Christianity is a form of bigotry. I am shocked to see someone commercializing on attacking the beliefs of Christianity by making a mockery of the ICHTHUS symbol. The vampyre and Darwin items need to be removed. I would have rated this item a zero but the only option given me was one star. Very disappointing.
1,Think you Youtube.,"Thinks to youtube I didn't have to spend a single cent on this. Another cheapa** ripoff of a good movie.Another movie yanked out of Sparkplug entertainments a**. Can you guess by name what it rips off? Heres a hint it involves the relationshp ship between a friendly pig and lovable spider and ended in every child and adult crying theier hearts out. The difference is that this crap here isn't heartfelt, looks like s***, makes no sense, stereotypes everywhere, I could go on. You have to be on acid to love this movie. You have alians, walking tvs, books eating zombie cats, a game where snakes get spanked, a french bee, silverfish police on motorcycles! I don't have to say more for you to know what to do if you see this movie anywhere."
5,Beautiful audio-visual treat!,"Beautifully filmed and arranged! They show some of the best known sights in Vienna and some unusual ones as well. The soprano singing an aria from the Magic Flute is exceptional (couldn't find her name, though). Note that this is not a documentary - it is a musical journey. If you like listening to music and would like some great visual stimulation as well while you do, this is for you. The images are lovely and fit the music well. If you know the old Naxos series most of those were very good as well but you didn't know what you were seeing unless you stopped the disk and went to the menu. They fixed it in this series by inserting a simple slide with a little information at the beginning of each section. As this is not a documentary per say, no more than that is needed, in my opinion -just enough to give some info without stopping the flow of music. No talking! Great!"
1,Burned hole in carpet discolored rug leaked water all over.,Do not buy faulty item it is a disaster to deal with no only did not preform with in specified standards it created a fire hazard and damage carpeting it could have possibly created a shock hazard. The hazard would have been to the wet flooring and electrical connection. Sunbeam does not have a live person answering the telephone but a recording to do the internet only for customer service. Why don't give me a call at home or respond my e-mail if not heard from with in a week I will pursue the problem the faulty vaporizer in the court for damages for my home.
1,Caution! Damages your carpeting,"This terrible unit damaged may carpeting. Even though I had placed it in a tray, still a half gallon water was leaked on my carpet."
1,"Not worth it, even if it's cheap.","You know what they say: You buy cheap, you get cheap. or worse, you get a shoddy humidifier. I bought one of these last winter and it stopped producing steam after 2 months. Even when it did work, it was barely noticable in my 10'x11' bedroom...and that is NOT a big space to humidify. Plus, there's no timer or safety switch-off for when/if the water runs out. Luckily I only used mine at night and turned it off in the morning (it lasted just under 8 hours on a full tank), but I could see how it could cause potential problems if left unattended longer. This time I'll invest a few more bucks and get something that actually works, and works safely."
2,just ok product,although it says that it is a cool mist humidifier it is actually a warm mist humidifier but it seems to do its job quite alright.but im not sure it would last very long and would not recommend to anyone.
3,does the job but hard to clean,"I had this humidifier for about a year, and it recently stopped running. I took it apart and found that the wires had corroded. I practically had to break the thing to get it open, and you can't get the calcium deposits out of the inside except through this microscopic hole, so I ended up banging it against my kitchen sink every few nights to get it out. It does work--it's warm mist, and it's not too loud. It'll last you one or two nights if you turn it off in the morning. If you can't spend a lot of money, go ahead and get this one because it does the job--better than not having one at all."
1,Terrible,"DON'T BUY IT!!! We bought this for our newborn baby and it's terrible. Yesterday, the vaporizer gave out a strong burning smell and then within 15 minutes or so, the baby room is filled with smoke. It's scary. What if we were not in the baby room and it's on for the whole night?"
1,Not a good product,"I had this for about 2 years, and was not impressed. It worked for a month or so, and since then, does nothing. If you fill it up with water, and then plug it in for several days, the water level never goes down. I've tried cleaning it repeatedly, and tried various things to make it work, but apparently it's just dead. It was a cheap product; you get what you pay for."
2,Only if you don't open the door...,"We bought this for our son's room when he had his first cold. It was OK, but is slow to humidify the room -- by morning, the room was fairly moist. However, if you open the door (perhaps to check on the little one) all the moisture escapes and you have to wait a few more hours before the room gets humid again. I am going to buy real humifier..."
3,Brake not that good,"I guess I was spoiled since I had an old craftsman circular saw with electronic brake and that baby stops on a dime. This saw's blade keeps spinning for a couple of seconds after you release the trigger. It's just slightly less than a regular saw so probably not worth the extra money. The other bad thing is that the blade height adjustment on mine came so that at certain blade heights (anything greater than 1 1/4"") the lever hits the plate before the screw is tightened. Now I have to fiddle with the screw so that the tightening range is just at the right spot so the lever works. I hope that fixes it.On the bright side, the saw is nice and light and seems pretty sturdy and also seems to have a lot of power. The blade visibility is very good.I appreciate the note about toolup.com. They had it cheaper with free shipping so I took advantage of Amazon's policy of getting 10% of the difference."
2,questionable durability,"At first this saw was great, nice sight lines from both sides, but after 6 months the brake rarely works, had to send it in to be serviced."
5,circular saw,"This is the second one of these saws that I have owned. The first one died after only 2 years of light/moderate use. I am a contractor by trade and both rely on quality tools and their dependability. I was very disappointed when the Milwaulkee repair shop told me the saw was not worth fixing...even though it looked almost brand new. Apparently something major broke because they gave me the saw back in a ""body bag"" as they referred to it...completely disassembled. However, since I loved the saw so much I decided to take a chance on another one. I just hope I have better luck with this one. As you all probably already know, this saw is now made in CHINA. Only time will tell just how much this has caused the quality to decline. ie. drywall, McDonald's glasses, baby formula, lead painted childrens' toys, etc, etc.TCardco"
1,Defect saw,"I bought this saw in late November for installing some laminated floors. I bought it largely based on the good customer reviews and the features of the saw. I liked the electric brake and it worked well for my project.The original saw blade couldn't be used to cut laminate boards, so I bought another saw blade. I had a hard time to change the blade but managed to do it. Then later when I wanted to change the blade for cutting some other things, the blade change pin got stuck. No matter how hard I try, I couldn't push it down to release the lock. I even tried to use hammers and other tools but couldn't get it unlocked.I have to commend the customer service of Amazon.com. I emailed them and quickly got a replacement saw. But the new saw arrived with exactly the same problem. So, I asked to return the new saw and the original saw and got the refund.I would have given it a 5 star if it didn't have this problem. It performed well until I needed to change the blade."
1,Not made in USA,"This might be a good saw, but it is made in China. Amazon says it is made in USA . I will find one made here by a USA company."
5,Nice Saw,"This is my second circular saw. I liked the excellent visibility of the blade while cutting. It was easy to make accurate straight cuts just by watching the blade. It feels solid, powerful, and the blade stops very fast when the power comes off."
4,rafter hook,I have used all sorts of cicular saws in 30 years and I agree with all thats said BUT bosch is the only one with a rafter hook. When working on a roof YOU NEED A RAFTER HOOK
2,Poor Quality,I ordered this saw to replace a 25 year old Milwaukee circular saw that has seen better days. After examining the new saw I decided to send it back and continue with the old saw. The new saws depth of cut adjustment system was out of alignment. The parts didn't line up properly. The foot or base of the saw is thin and looks to be easily damaged. The saw has been well reviewed and I was hoping for better quality but I was very disappointed. I was worried that the first time I dropped it it would be damaged.
5,"Solid tool, one of the best","This is a solid built tool. The stock blade is crap so be sure to replace it, but I love everything about this saw. It has lots of power it produces accurate and precise cuts, it feels good to hold and overall performs impressively. For the price, you just can't beat it."
4,Good Saw,"This saw is typical of Milwaukee standards. Very well built, convenient features (tilt-lok, tool storage for blade changing) and plenty of power. I opted for the 6394 because I wanted the quick-cord, and electric brake. Much like circulars saws from other manufacturers, the stock blade is not that great. The only issue I had was that the dust goes out rear-right side and I'm left-handed. Overall, it is a great saw and I would recommend it to anyone and actually my father-in-law bought one also and he is left-handed as well."
5,Great Saw,"Wanted this saw based on comparisons and reviews from the Internet. I checked it out in my local home depot then decided that I wanted it. It has good balance even though it is heavy. The bevel and depth adjustments are quick and easy. Build quality is great, as well. Cuts fast and straight. Has an electric brake that stops the blade pretty quickly. I love the removable power cord because it helps for storage. The adjustable handle is cool, but not necessary. From top to bottom and left and right, it's a great saw."
3,"A collection of songs, not an album","Amazon's review of this CD describes it as ""stylistically restless."" That sums up my problem with it. While most of the songs are well-executed, the sum is less than the parts. This disk simply is too idiosyncratic, spinning off in too many directions and never cohering into an album that I want to hear again. Try her other CDs."
2,"She's really, really good -- why don't I like her?","Powerful voice. Mimics the styles of a variety of classic Hispanic singers. Incredible range of material. But, unlike Lhasa de Sela or Astrid Hadad, she leaves me flat."
3,Not worth 13 bucks,"I was disappointed with this album. two good songs, the rest are average, the ones in english are terrible. I am going back to listening to Cafe Tacuba and Aterciopelados."
2,overrated,"isn't wearing your ancestry on your sleeve so blatantly and in such a predictable fashion just a 21st century version of Al Jolson? the problem with so many new-traditionalist artists is that they lessen rather than deepen the understanding of the complexity and diversity of the celebrated cultural groups experience. hippies and white liberals love it, but where does that leave those that are living it? far better capturing the Latina experience are Julietta Venegas, south of the border, and east LA's Lysa Flores, north of the border."
5,Surprising,"Listening to the first track the first time, you think this is going to be an average album, maybe a mistake to get it. But as the album progresses each song reveals flavours and styles that are surprising, interesting, varied and strong. Even two songs as overworked/corny as La Bamba and La Cucaracha come off new and fresh. This could album could appeal to people who like cumbia, flamenco, jazz, Cuban, or Latin influence music."
2,Same ol' same ol'. . .,"I was sadly disappointed with this CD & I guess with Lila Downs, too. I really liked some of her early albums, but recently she just seems to be recycling the same old things in different songs. As we were listening to La Bamba, I remarked, ""I guess it's about time for the 'Hip-Hop"" part, & sure enough, a few seconds later it went into the same old 'Hip-Hop' thing she puts in so many songs. She's a great singer, but I get tired of hearing her show off with some of these really low or long sustained notes--I wished she'd just do some really new & different music. The ""Cucaracha"" is kind of interesting, but seems to much of an attempt to match Manu-Chao or Los de Abajo. I actually can't stand to listen to this CD."
2,"A confusing book, with large gaps in explanation","I found this book to be confusing and difficult to understand. It was used for the text in an Intelligent Systems at my Uni, and I believe that it made an already difficult subject even more so.The book would have benefitted from a better explanation, perhaps with more thoroughly explained examples and full source code for all the examples included.This is not really a book for those who have problems with higher math, nor for those whose interest in the area of ""Artificial Intelligence"" is casual. It is not really even a good book for use as a text."
5,One of the best bands...,"...You've never heard of! The Vladimirs should be huge! Great mix of punk, metal, rock and roll, with killer attitude! Buying this will make you a better person! Listening to it regularly, will make you even better than that!"
5,superb,"This fantastic book is designed as a scrapbook of over 100 years of Kurdish history. It pieces together photographs, newspaper clippings, and excerpts from letters to present the story of the Kurds and their persistent, ultimately unsuccessful attempts to gain independence.Major events and figures are covered in all the regions of Kurdistan - Southeast Turkey, Eastern Syria, and Northwest Iran. I would recommend this book to anyone as a primer on political events in the Middle East during the 20th century. Be warned that this volume is literally quite heavy."
1,Lost Drive one month after warranty,"I used this drive regularly but not overused. Right after the warranty expired, it starts to buzz loudly and blink a red light. My Dell computer doesn't see it anymore so I basically lost all the video that was on the drive.There is no troublshooting info with the guide or relevant information at the Maxtor site. Not even any info about what the red light means (a presume it means the worse).I know this product has been discontinued but there should be better support. I have more than one of these so now I'm worried about the others going down as well (they have a few more months on their warranties)"
1,failed after warranty over,"This EXTERNAL drive failed just after 1 year warranty expired,and I haven't used it very often - just occasional backups.Now, it just makes a lot of clicking noises when turned on.My computer no longer recognizes it - the drive is toast.(I have an INTERNAL Maxtor drive that seems to be fine, however,it is only about one year old - crossing my fingers.)I used to think Maxtor was tops in reliability.I'll buy Seagate or IBM from now on. I've had no troublewith them."

1,nothing here!,Another symphony based on the ten plagues of Egypt (like Cui said of Rachmaninoff's 1st).A tuneless piece going nowhere.Why does Chandos put out this cr--?! Naxos never does.
2,It was nice while it lasted...,"I bought this for my new patio and was very excited when it arrived. It looked great for about a week. One not very strong wind gust bent the pole in half. Another patio umbrella - just 10 feet away - which I bought for 14.95 on sale at a home improvement store held up just fine and is still going strong a month later. Too bad the guality of the pole is so bad, the umbrella fabric itself was of nice quality - perhaps the fabric was just too heavy for the pole."
1,Faulty Fuses,"I ordered four items from Boston Industrial Tools. At first, they sent only one item, a box of Assorted ATC plugin car fuses, 120 pieces, 5A, 10A, 15A, 20A, 25A, and 30A. Problem - I am a hot shot Electrical Engineer, and I immediately noticed that the fusible elements within the differently colored fuse bodies all looked identical. So I used a laboratory power supply to pump 5A, then 10A, then 15A, then 20A through one of the 5A fuses. It never blew. A 5A fuse should blow right away with 20A. These fuses, Item No. CFA 120, made in China, are downright dangerous, and should be recalled. I plan to write to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission about these dangerous fuses."
1,These Were Not Car Fuses,Not sure what I paid for. These were not car fuses and would not fit in my Scion tC. You can keep my 7 bucks if it is that important.
5,One of the 3 most entertaining books ever.,"I think if you are going to buy this book or are even considering it, you have to be a very big fan of the show and appreciative of it, because the average fan might not get much out of it. It has awesome photos taken during the final episode with comments by the cast. It's not a story or script or anything like that, it's just one last look at what the actors went through and how they felt. But I have the book and I loved it. A lot of behind-the-scenes pictures were great."
3,Not Suitable For Me,"I purchased this battery backup for a very different purpose than it is apparently meant for: I have sleep apnea, and need a ""plug-into"" power source for my CPAP breathing machine, if regular power is lost. I thought this would work, but it only has an extremely limited time working on battery-only, and I guess is ONLY meant for short-time use in a computer-emergency. Not right for me (unfortunately the description did not mention this aspect of it) so I returned it for a refund - which I received quickly, no questions asked."
5,Great backup power,"This serves all my PC power needs. It has four battery backup inputs (I use them for the PCU, monitor, satellite modem, and router) It has four more for other office electronics. It works great---no more losing my data when the power goes out. I've paid more for units that perform the same function and was disappointed. I love this unit."
2,Belkin F6C550-AVR - A real disappointment,"This is my third Belkin UPS, and my last. They have changed the software to something that runs in a DOS like screen that for some reason makes the processor on the computer run all the time. It has slowed my PC down, significantly extended computer start up times and no longer has the easy to read dials in the old Bull Dog software. Now all the info is in a spreadsheet. Tech support says this software is now used on all Belkin UPS products."
5,Works with linux just fine with some tweaking,"I am a xubuntu linux user and got this working fine. Do not use the belkin linux drivers or software though, they are worthless. Instead use nut 2.2 or newer (for ubuntu, get it from the hardy release) with the megatec_usb driver. Works great and there is plenty of documentation for it."
2,Smells (Updated),"This Belkin unit smells. Received it, plugged it in to charge the batteries and within a few minutes it started to smell of that typical 'electrical smell.' It has now been two days and it still smells but perhaps it is decreasing or my sensitivity to the smell is decreasing. I'm keeping the windows open and hoping it is a just breaking itself in.[UPDATED] The smell disappeared after about a week. The unit does work flawlessly. While I was using the hammer drill in the front yard the unit kicked in to keep the plasma TV working (until I could tell the kids to shut it down - no use pressing my luck...)"
2,"works ok, but no wonder","I've had several UPSs now for a while. Belkin UPS quit after about 3 years of work. I understand that this may be long enough, but I have several from APC and they are still working. One UPS, I think, now has been in service 7 or 8 years."
1,dissappointed,"When the power goes off and the back-up battery runs down, the unit shuts down and does not re-start when power comes back on. This leaves everything plugged into it also without power until you return and reset the unit. This makes it pretty useless as a back-up device. You have to be around to turn it back on."
3,Know the wattage of your machine,"My Mac G5 with 20"" display draws too much power for this unit. Even with NOTHING else plugged in, the Belkin beeps an overload warning the second I power up the Mac. I can run nearly everything else - Cable modem, router, USB hub, etc - without a warning, but the Mac alone draws too much power."
4,Okay,"I bought this Belkin Battery Backup after a power failure disaster was narrowly averted by MS Word's AutoRecovery feature. It's worked fine at warding off power failures since, I haven't really tested how well it does what it's supposed to do.I do have some comments on usability. My wife finds the necessity to press and hold the power switch for several seconds counter-intuitive.I would like the non-battery backup outlets to be controlled by the switch so I could shut everything down for power conservation with one step."
1,Belkin Battery Backup,Not a good product. Half of the cells do not work even after following the instructions. Would not recommend.
4,nice screw driver,"This screw diver works very well. It is not as fast as a regular drywall screwdriver, but works well with 2X lumber like decks and fences. It is either on or not, so it does not have the finesse of my cordless drill driver, nor will it work for drilling. It does work a little different then the cordless drill drivers in that it does not have a clutch and stop driving when the torque gets above a setting, but it has a depth control nose that will drive a screw to a consistent depth. This feature makes it very nice for drywall or when I installed sub flooring as I could quickly and consistently drive the heads of the screws to just under the surface of the subfloor.It feels like a solidly built tool that should last for many years."
2,Shame on you Milwaukee...,"I haven'y used this yet...'Just got it yesterday.I GLADLY paid alot more for this 6740-20 than the 6742-20, thinking that the 6740 was ""Made in America"". NOT! It's made in China! I am bummed out...HEY, everybody....We need to make good stuff HERE in the USA. Jobs for Americans...'So Americans can afford to buy stuff. Shame on you, Milwaukee....Let's keep decent jobs here in the USA...not just jobs in Walmart, either...but in MANUFACTURING. Everybody; cast your vote by buying only stuff made in the USA. I'm trying to, but having a hard time. :(Amen."
5,Very powerful motor ready to mount,"I purchased this motor one month ago. I replaced a 1 1/2 HP motor that was on my Delta contractor saw. This motor only weighed about 7 or 8 pounds more than the original motor. It is 16 amps at 220 volts. It was almost a perfect fit on the motor mount. I was able to change out the motors in about 45 minutes. I had to also order a new pulley for the 7/8"" arbor. The difference between the 1 1/2 Hp motor and this 3 HP motor is unbelievable. I don't detect any more vibration than before. I can now cut any type of wood. It now cuts plywood like butter and 2"" hardwood just as easy. I have nothing but praise for this motor so far. It was hundreds of dollars cheaper than anything else I could find. The motor comes up to speed instantly as well."
4,Very Good Show,"I didn't think I'd enjoy British humor, but Coupling and this show have proved me wrong. Give it a shot! If you were burnt by the sub-par US version of The Inbetweeners, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the original show."
5,Comfort and affirmation for IA kids,"This is one of those books that will be revisited time and again. Internationally adopted kids can relate to Tall Boy's sorrow and fears as he adjusts to his new home and family in America. Knowing that author lived just a miles from our home, and that the book was loosely based on her son's life, helped to validate the story for my daughter. We have owned this book for several years and my daughter is NOT a big reader, but I frequently find this book on her bedside table. I will return it to the bookcase, only to have it reappear again on the bedside table a couple of days later."
3,Surprisingly....dull!,"Let me start by saying the playing of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra is excellent, as I have come to expect. I have a number of their recordings with Neeme Jarvi and everyone of them has knocked my socks off. The playing is always fabulous with a real strength and passion but beautiful slow movements when required. So I was looking forward to getting this recording. Alas, it is dissapointing. The perfomance lacks excitment when you expect it and the slower sections are a little dull. The 'Montagues and Capulets', perhaps the most famous movement of the work is so slow it almost makes you wonder whether there is any tension between the clans. There are, thankfully some highlights but not enough to give the recrding 3 stars."
4,Fun and easy,It is really a nice and fun workout. The music is nice and the steps are really easy to follow. What kept me from giving 5 stars is the fact that it is a bit too short.
2,"LeapFrog Click Start ""My first computer""","My step grandson was given this a year ago. His mother isn't computer literite and thus far the child only played with the accessories. It nevergot hooked up or used. Be sure the parent is able to do all the hook up connections or it won't help the child at all, unless you go to his house and do it yourself. By the time we found out, parts were missing.Too bad since this would have really been a great educational start for him."
5,great to have,"The adapter really is a must have for the clickstart. You can use batteries, but it takes four at a time, and it's really not worth the hassle. I bought the cheapest batteries I could find, and it still cost me two bucks. I only did that because Walmart didn't have the adapter avail and I didn't want to make my child wait a week for this to ship. Keep in mind, the keyboard still requires batteries and doesn't have the option for an adapter, but that uses less power. I'll just use rechargables for it. So, I figure w/in a month, the adapter will pay for itself."
5,Savior!!,Savior! I accidentally threw away my daughters clickstart adapter while moving! I thought we were not going to be able to puchase the adapter separately but we could! It works perfect now my daughter can play again!
5,a must buy,Don't use the product without the ac adaptor. You will have to replace batteries too often.
5,A must have,"A must have! My 2 1/2 year old plays with his ClickStart all the time. Batteries were becoming a habit to buy. I think I paid around $10.00 with Amazon and received free shipping. Thank goodness for this computer adapter, wish more adapters were made for toys. Thanks to Amazon, I am always pricing checking for the best deals through them first and to see if that item applies to free shipping."
5,Does what it is supposed to.,"This plugs in to the ClickStart so that you don't have to run it with batteries. Amazon wouldn't leave me alone about reviewing it, so here it is. It works great, didn't need directions or anything. The darn thing just plugs in to the ClickStart on the one end with the single connection and in to the wall outlet - you know...the electrical socket that has the three holes in it? - from the other end. Amazing! Couldn't live without it!"
3,Works adequately,"This is a no frills humidifier. It has worked well for our family for over two years now, and we use it most nights during the winter months. It is a bit loud (about as loud as a rotating table top fan) but it can get louder if it is not cleaned out regularly, or if the lid/top is not placed on properly. It does need to be cleaned regularly, otherwise it is unsanitary. The glow in the dark feature is useful. It will make a difference in how well you can breathe, as well as help to leave your skin feeling less dry. For the money, this one has worked well for us with many months of use."
4,Sutible for a stripper pole,"I used 2 of these to hold a brass pole to be used as a stripper pole. They are of sufficient strength to hold against the strongest of spins, at least so far."
1,pedometer with radio,"I bought this item because I walk a lot in my job and was curious how far I walked on a daily basis...I got this one because I thought the radio would be fun on my deliveries...but alas, I was ripped off as ..not only does the pedometer not work at all, but neither does the radio---I live in a small town, so we dont have many stations, so I think the radio might work for people in large cities, but it doesn't work in my town at all...I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,"True Felt-Making, NOT felting knits.","I read this book along with a few others to get some inspiration and learn more about the felting process. While this book is very informative and well written, please be advised that it contains instruction specific to the use of wool batts or roving type material and not yarns. If that is what you are looking for, then this the book for you.If not, try out:""Knit One, Felt Too: Discover the magic of knitted felt with 25 easy patterns (Paperback)by Kathleen Taylor ""I think you will find it a nice beginners guide to felting knit projects."
3,"Cool projects, but take a class first","This book is really well organized and has some wonderful-looking projects to try. However, as a complete beginner I ran into trouble and didn't find much advice in the book about what I might be doing wrong. If you have some basic experience with feltmaking I think you would like this book because it has a bunch of simple, nifty projects that would make wonderful gifts."
3,"Furreal Cat is nice, but not worth the price","My daughter was another who had to have this. I looked at EBay, and saw nothing but ripoff. Fortunately a Kaybee Toys got a shipment in. We gave it to her for her birthday, and although I thought it was a dissapointment, my daughter loves it. It meows anytime you touch it. When you pet its back, it starts to purr. If you scratch its lower back, it's supposed to arch up. It does do that, but only about an inch. You really have to watch it to notice it. If you pull its tail, it's supposed to get mad. Well the 'mad hiss' it makes sounds the same as it purrs. When the head moves, you can hear the motor hum. Reminds me alot like the Furby. Like I said, my daughter loves it, but personally I think it's a waste of money. Definitely not worth what they're selling on EBay. If you're smart, wait and find a store that has a demo out and see how it works. Believe me, there will be hundreds on the shelf after Christmas."
1,Why can't Kids get the toy they want?,"My sister and I both want one of the Fur Real Friends, but we can't find them anywhere in our area. Mom and Dad where going to surprise me with one for my birthday in Decmeber, but told me there are none to be had. I'm really mad because my real cat died last week and this would have been the replacement for my cat. So someone please tell me WHY there are none to be had, if you can?"
2,Furreal,"Disappointing..cute at first,sounds too mechanical,kids werent very interested after the first hour of play,returned it to the store and kids never missed it."
5,Amazing furreal!,"I got this toy for Christmas. Ilove it. I abanded this toy,and it got some brudle hits. It was still alive! Know I keep safe becuse I don't want it to die. I don't think this toy is a wast of money.Mine is ginger. It came with a silver/grey newborn kittin."
4,Good book for costume Ideas,The book presents many basic costume ideas for children with enough instructions to get you going. Most of the ideas in this book will take planning and time to put together.
5,Spode at Christmas!,"This pattern is a classic. I grew up with it and now that I have my own home, have started my own set. We use these far more than the china we received for our wedding ... I pull out my Spode the day after Thanksgiving and we use for the entire month of December (breakfast, lunch and dinner!). The bowls and mugs are on the small (dainty) side, but they're adequate. The mugs are a great switch from the cup and saucer that make up so many of the groupings (We're a coffee drinking house so we prefer mugs, even if they, are on the small side). The dinnerware tolerates the dishwasher well so it's ""no fuss"" which is great during the busy holidays. It adds a bit of festivity to any meal or snack. You can't go wrong with this classic pattern."
2,"Beautiful Concept, Clumsy Production","There are so many books about FLW that any new one has to be special to rate my buying it. This atlas purports to show a great number of his works together with enough information to let Wright fans find, and, if possible tour the buildings. Good intentions here are somewhat undone by poor photo editing and printing. Some of the images are wonderful, but many needed help (i.e. image processing) before being sent to the printer. In some cases the printing is at fault, because one can feel an excess deposit of ink on some images and not others. I feel sorry for the author! Her publisher really let her down. If this book was re-edited by a Photoshop professional and the printer properly supervised, it would be great book indeed."
3,"Good reference, but not comprehensive","For fans of FLW interested in touring his buildings, this book is a good resource as a handy state-by-state reference. However, it is not comprehensive. To be fair, there are well over 500 FLW buildings across the U.S., so providing descriptions of each one is impractical. However, an index listing of all the properties and locations would have been helpful and expected given the point of this volume.In the case of my state (Washington State), the author left out two of the three existing FLW homes in Washington and did not choose to highlight the most significant of the lot, the Griggs House. Further, in her description of the Brandes House, she claimed there are only two FLW homes in the Pacific Northwest, which is incorrect. There are three (Brandes, Griggs, and Tracy). Although the Tracy House is small, it is still a significant Usonian house beautifully integrated with its site in Normandy Park."
4,Morricone Kill: Spaghetti Western Magic from the Maestro,"Although the whole album is good there are certain movies Ennio Morricone wrote movie music for that were generally more appreciated. The best music on this particular CD is for ""My Name is Nobody"", ""A Professional Gun"", and ""Duck You Sucker (A Fistful of Dynamite, Giu LA Testa)"". Certainly the songs for ""Blood & Guns"", ""The Hellbenders"", and ""The Big Gundown"" ""Let's Go Kill, Comrades"" although not as well known are good. You will be hard pressed to find all the music of Morricone you enjoy on just one or two CDs. His diveristy and proliferation throughout his career is well respected.CA Luster"
2,Fun while it lasted!,"This company was great to deal with. The boomerang not so much. It was exciting to have a real wood boomerang. My son was thrilled because they are so hard to find. However, we only threw it a few times before it hit the ground and splintered. We weren't particular abusive and we used it on a grassy field. It couldnt take the fall I guess. But hey, the 5 times we threw it -- it came back like a champ! The company was kind in its customer dealings after the fact. My best advice is if you are going to buy this -- might as well get two so you have a back up."
3,Genuine Wood Boomerang,Toy was ok. Rough. Not well made but a child will have fun with it as will the family dog.
2,not what I expected,"This was the first time I ever delt with a boomerang and I had high hopes that were shattered by the quality of the boomerang. I only got to throw it 3 times and it never came back, I could deal with that because it was a little windy outside. On my third throw it went up in 1 piece and hit the ground in 2 pieces, I was pretty disappointed it didn't last longer than a minute."
2,"It returns, if thrown EXACTLY right","It actually does return, but is not a good performer. Check with a company like Colorado or Channel Craft; even the Aerobie is easier to throw (all these companies sell through Amazon). Ben Ruhe, the man who is essentially the father of the American boomerang hobby, took a look at this and termed it a ""garbage boomerang"". If you're a beginner, the ColoradoAspen(available through Amazon) is one of the better beginner boomerang Amazon sells; go to a boomerang discussion group and you'll get lots of help (including how to get left handed versions)."
2,Good thing it's only 30 bucks!,"The thing that bothers me about this keyboard is that Belkin felt the need to move some of the keys.Of course they are the ones you use most: the zero key on the 10-key pad is half the size of any regular keyboard, the enter key is moved over so that you hit the ""\"" all the time, and the ""Delete"" and ""End"" keys got moved too.All in all, if you're a major computer user at work or at home, I would chose one that is more mainstream and user friendly. I don't think I'll get used to using the zero key by scrunching up my thumb every day.Who would've thunk that you'd have to look at the key layout before you buy? I definitely didn't, but I will know next time."
3,This is not the F83815 as listed! Pdf file says F8E832!,"Sorry, but i've seen several errors lately while looking for a nice keyboard set. You have the F8E815 # listed above which is 3.6pds; but this one says 5 pds! Also the download of the pdfsays FE83832#, so this is either the wrong pdf file for this,or you've got the item wrong! cause there's no pic of the bundle.Someone should review this mistake and correct it i'vejust ordered the real Belkin FE83815 and it says it's 3.6 pds shipping. You are selling the other Belkin set that's a two-tonemodel-FE83832! Please correct this as people ordering this willget a big surprise when it comes. sincerely shffl2bdwz,ma"
4,Good products,"I tried to buy one that had a light in the mirror, but could not find one, so I bought this. It works fine, the mirror is really anti fog and the piks work fine. The only downside is that there is no light, but I already new that beforehand."
4,Good product.,"Not too expensive, just what I needed. Been using this for a month now and no complains about it yet."
3,It's Okay,"Bought this item through AmericanWholesale.I'm a dental assistant & bought this item for the use at home. The item is exactly is described, but I dislike the quality of the mirror. Yes it is an Anti Fog mirror. But the quality is so cheap. I wiped it with a soft cloth & it got all scratched up! I don't know with what!I'm not sure whether or not to recommend it because after all it is a good price."
1,Big dissapointment,"I bought this product for a friend at her request. It was not for me, I just handled the purchase of the item. I saw it when she opened the box, and was totally dissatisfied. She said it was alright, and kept it. The legs were protruding through the packaging on arrival. The stand was bent so it wobbled when stood on a hard floor. It is standing on deep carpeting where she put it, so she said it didn't matter. I was not happy with this item at all, and wouldn't have paid more than five dollars for it. It looked like it came from a garage sale."
4,The keyless chuck is a plus,"I can only pass on what I hear from the field, and they specifically requested this keyless chuck drill. Milwaukee and Makita are our main tools we use in the field because of the durability and power."
5,Milwaukee 1/2 Drill,"One of the best drills on the market today. I would recommend this drill to anyone looking to purchase a drill. Torque is more than you can hold on to. The drill because of the quality is a little heavy compared to a portable drill but worth it. I've had to replace the chuck once because of the torque while drilling a 2"" hole in cross beam. The bit dug in and twisted the drill out of my hand and bent the chuck internally. I would still recommend this drill to anyone"
1,Did I Get The Only Milwaukee Lemon?,"I purchased this drill at Amazon to replace a 10-year old well-used & abused Sears drill that went up in smoke. I was told by my FIL (contractor) to get the Milwaukee since ""they're the best"". I've used it only 3 or 4 times now and it spits out oil (from the motor vent). I guess it's only a matter of time before all the supposedly sealed oil leaks out & burns out the motor. Would NEVER purchase another Milwaukee product. I really thought this to be the last drill I'd ever need but now expect it to start smoking in a few more uses. Perhaps I got their only lemon but this tool was way too expensive to take another chance. Back to Sears for me cause on-sale I can get a corded 1/2"" drill for < $100. I should've sent it back to Amazon after the first use but it's been too long so I'm stuck with this POS. Also hate that keyless chuck."
3,Nice Scoop / Ugly Horse,"This is a well made item, and my wife likes it. I bought it to go with Ice Bucket. My only takeawy is I think the horse handle could be better looking."
5,The Right Tool for the Job,"To make great Japanese omelets, it helps to have the right pan. This is a great pan for a great price. It's also great for shallow frying any kind of food."
5,Sad but lovely,"I'm not surprised that the dust jacket for this book doesn't mention that this story is about someone dying; most people probably wouldn't pick up the book if it did, to read such a sad story. I was surprised when death entered the plot and stayed there. I felt a bit fooled by the dust jacket, actually. But the story was lovely. The author's writing style is so gentle and flowing. She makes me want to live in a small town in Maine in the worst way. This story is told by a man, Sam, working as a vet in his small home town. His first love, a free spirit named Dee Dee, unexpectedly returns to town with her young son. She and her son become an integral part of Sam's life again, and the life of his wife. Dee Dee makes candles for a living - I loved this aspect. This book tells a melancholy but sweet story. After being initially surprised by it, I would definitely recommend it. I went on to buy more by this author once I started it."
5,Emotionally Engaging!,"Absolutely loved this book! I must echo completely the comments of barblatch@hotmail.com, who summed it all up - in my opinion - so perfectly. I would like to add that I applaud the courageous use of a current controversial issue in this novel."
5,A very compelling and emotion-producing story!!!,"This is the second of McKinnon's books I have read. I loved the first one, and this one is even better! Once I started reading, I found I simply could not put the book down. Caught up in the story line, and transported by the author to New England, you meet characters with whom you can identify or who remind you of someone you know. Descriptions are so vivid that you ARE there; you can almost experience the sounds, tastes, and smells. You laugh, you cry; the characters become a part of your life. You will never be the same again! I can hardly wait for her next book and will be eagerly awaiting its release."
3,OK for a summer read.,"This book is not earth-shattering, but not bad either. A good light read. (A little too light for the price of a hard cover.)"
3,The book was a sweet book on friendship.,The book was interesting. Made me think in the old relationships I had has a kid. How my life is far from those old friend and the good old times.
1,Not the book I thought I had purchased,"The description on the dust jacket made the book sound intriguing and mysterious. But once I started reading, it was your run-of-the-mill romance. The ""mystery"" was more depressing than shocking, and that made the last half of the book was slow and predictable. What disappoints me is that I paid for a hardcover book, and it took me only an hour to read it.The afterword in the book described the basis for all the characters. In my opinion, the book was too autobiograpical. It is a work of fiction, and the story became bogged down with the references to reality."
4,Great book; it had me going,"I was thrilled to read a 'love story' about that didn't turn out to be sleazy! I'm not into explicit sex in books, and the fact that the main character didn't follow the flame of his past was a great plus for me. And considering that the book is based in northern Maine, and I have lived in Maine all my life, made it easier for me to visualize the setting (though I've not been to northern Maine before). All in alll, a refreshing book to read. Read it in one sitting while at the beach last summer."
5,A Great Read That You Hate To See End!!!,I first got this novel from the library & was skeptical as to if I would like it.I read it in one day when I was home sick.It is beautifully written & it will touch your heart.Candles on Bay Street is the story of a wonderful friendship that through distance still lasted & of the sacrifices we must make for those we truly love.This novel is one of the few books I can say I really love & has been worth reading many times.Candles on Bay Street is a moving story that shows that even today when the world seems so lost there still is love & beauty.Throughout this book you will laugh & cry & become close to all the characters & seem to feel with & for them.You must read this novel--it will be totally worth it.
5,Beautifully written,"KC McKinnon's story is beautifully written and told. Candles On Bay Street encompasses many kinds of love. All of which the author describes so well in a flowing prose. I think the sadness in the book is far from contrived, but there to make the reader feel and think beyond her/himself. KC McKinnon is a wonderful author who always seems make her charcaters come alive."
1,Disappointed....,"I picked it up at the store the other day because I read ""Dancing at the Harvest Moon"" and enjoyed it. However, there is no comparison! I can't believe all of the glowing reviews on here. Did we read the same book? I wasn't looking for a book as boring as everyday life, but I also didn't want one that seemed like a Disney movie! I have to agree with the guy from Tennessee. I found myself wanting to laugh and I don't think that was the point. I think Ms. Pelletier watches too much ""Party of Five""!"
5,Written from the heart,"Candles on the Bay was clearly written from the heart and soul of the author. It shows in the beautifully crafted sentences, descriptions and characters, many of whom were inspired by real people near and dear to the author. To everyone after me who reads this book, PLEASE take the time to read the acknowledgements at the end of the book. Also, read everything. Read the quotes at the start of each chapter. Study the perfectly done illustrations and their captions."
1,BOREING detox miracle souece book,"This without a doubt is the most boreing book I have ever read,I understand it is filled with facts but OMG.If it was not so much trouble I would send it back."
5,Great Health Bible,"I love this book because it helps you from step one to the end and everywhere in between. There are 4 includeing myself doing this detox and i've seen firsthand how it works. We are changed physically, mentally & spirtural. GREAT!!"
5,Thge Detox Miracle Soucebook,"This is a very well written and useful book. We bought it on the afvice of a friend AFTER my wife was subjected to a questionable course of action by her current doctor. She wanted to put her on a very expensive drug (Xolair) which as it turned out blocked the immunogens she is taking and is very dangeous. It did, however, provide an indefinite and regular cash flow to the doctor and her clinic.Needless to say, my wife changed doctors and is an avid fan of Dr. Morse's videos as well.This book is a great educaional tool AND reference book in one."
5,AWESOME BOOK!!!,THIS IS A FANTASTIC BOOK...I EAT A VEGAN DIET ANYWAY SO ITS NOT SUCH A SHOCK TO MY SYSTEM TO ADOPT THIS WAY OF EATING. I ALREADY FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW! DONT EXPECT TO ABSORB ALL THIS INFORMATION IN ONE READING...I CONTINUALLY GO BACK AND REREAD SECTIONS. LOVE HIS YOU TUBE VIDEOS ALSO!
5,Very informative and inspiring,I have not seen all of theses DVDs but have watched the series on EWTN. Father Barron is a wonderful teacher. The scenery is awesome. The information inspiring and educating. I would highly recommend these DVDs. A must for every Catholic and those who want to know what the Catholic faith is really about.
5,Beautiful and informative,We saw part of this series on PBS and my husband was so impressed he asked me to get it for him as a Christmas gift. it explains the doctrines of the Catholic Church very clearly and the visuals are spectacular! We look forward to watching all of it.
3,Quart Bags Sturdy but Tricky,"These quart bags are very sturdy but in my Tilia FoodSaver it's alittle tricky to get these to vacuum properly, compared with FoodSaver branded bags. It usually takes some fiddling with the bag alignment and several attempts. The actual seal quality seems OK. No special label panel on the bag so you must write on the surface with magic marker (not that you can't see what's inside). Construction quality would rate a 4 star, ease of use, 3 star. These bags were used to freeze about 25 pounds of berries. Would I buy again? Maybe given a price drop of 10%...these pre-cut bags are a tad overpriced."
2,This was a strange book,"The Coffin Tree was very confusing to me. The author repeatedly jumps from one time period to another and does not explain exactly what is happening at a specific moment. The characters are confusing and you have to read the inside cover to find out just what country they are talking about. Still, it is an interesting book. If you are the type of person who likes to pick apart and examine the different aspects of a story and place them together so that they make sense, this would be a very good book for you."
3,"Its good, but...","Its a nice book, but the pictures are all black and white. Some are a little grainy too. I'd spring for one with all color photos, but this one does look nice."
5,A before unseen view of Jackie,"I was captivated by this book. James Spada has compiled several well-known photographs with many photos I had never seen. He does not try to analyse or to delve into the behind the scenes. He presents the photos with a paragraph or two, and lets us glimpse into Jackie Kennedy Onassis's life. I was entranced by the pictures of her youth and the pure beauty and joy in several ungarded moments. A beautiful tribute."
3,Nice works from epica,"Yes, very nice works, may be you cant find this videos another video sites, But i dont know that this studio records are playback.(look Sensorium - times between 1:40~1:48) I learnt that via this DVD. :( its very bad! We didnt waiting for studio shows or Simone's looks.However we love Epica :) We are waiting for a real live concert dvd records. Thanks"
2,CRAPPY UPS,"I bought this ups because of the outside the box message ""15 minutes backup"". But the UPS only with my iMac 2007 can't handle more than 3 minutes when the AC power is out. Fortunately the iMac shut down in a very few seconds and the UPS still OK for me, but BELKIN lies when offers up to 15 minutes of backup time, its a fake. The software that came in the box didn't work neither my iMac nor my PC and i had to download the software in the belkin's web site."
1,Terrible...just terrible...,"I cannot, in all good conscience, rate this item higher than a single star. Though I have had this unit for a few months now, it has failed on me numerous times, more than any reliable UPS should. Even when there is no power interruption, the unit will often click off unexpectedly, effectively shutting down every single electronic that is plugged into it. This is quite frustrating (and frankly inexcusable), especially when I use this device with all of my high-end equipment. Another faulty characteristic of this device to note...it makes a frequent and EXTREMELY annoying high-pitched beep every time it clicks off (so unless you're deaf, I strongly urge you to take this into consideration). If you value your electronics, DO NOT BUY THIS! I would recommend a CyberPower unit, which is far more reliable and priced fairly."
5,It works!!,"Our rural electric coop doesn't call them outages, just glitches. They happen often and this Belkin surge protection w/ battery backup was to make my life easier. It works! Isn't that the best that can be said of an item that operates as designed?"
2,Surprised in a bad way,"I have to say that i have always considered Belkin to be tier 1 product. I have had this unit for 1 year. The power went out last night. It took me 30 seconds to get to my computer to shut it down and the unit failed. Dead battery. Come on, I had an APC that lasted 5 years before the battery died."
3,"Cheap, and works... for a while","It works, but it began glitching after a couple of years, and then the battery died. I know that UPS battery life is limited, but I have two APC UPSs which have outlasted the Belkin by a couple of years. So overall, I'd have to say it's worth paying more and getting an APC UPS."
4,"So far, so good","I've only had this for a month or two, but it has been good so far. I live in a rural area that has fairly frequent power flickers. I bought this to keep my computer from losing power during the one-second episodes. I haven't had any power glitches yet, but I like this unit because it is small compared to most battery backups and the price was good. The only improvement I would make is to separate the outlets more so that items with an over-sized transformer plug would not cover up the adjacent outlet. But I only need two of the six and it's not a problem for me."
5,Does what I expected,Nice small footprint. Keeps the computer accessories and answering machine from needing to be reset when the electric flashes.
4,not good for high end PCs but good for Periferals,Not powerful enough for high end PCs but a great li'l Periferal back up for USB devices that hook to the computer and can be spiked with voltage through USB cables if not protected by the main UPS. my main(1200VA unit) has only two perifrial non battery plugins and cannot be used for this purpose as it would sap away from the power needs of the PC and monitor; but this device takes over with a battery for those devices. the bulldog software can be used with ANY UPS.
4,Helps a lot,I believe our bodies became used to the over the counter products that they stopped working. I bought this to try and I noticed my kids began breathing easier. The only problem is that it is very hard to find in the stores. I was glad I located it online.
2,Doesn't work that well,Winter Wonder Balm has too mild a scent to clear the sinuses and facilitate breathing. Wish it had worked for me.
2,"back light is fine, front light doesnt last",the front light doesnt last very long. wish i knew this before i bought it from a local shop. just get a LED. its worth it.
1,Falls apart within weeks!,I'm a fan of planet bike products but not this one! The rear light fell off the clamp that attaches it to the post the second time out. The front light doesn't blink so it goes through batteries faster. I had to change the batteries while out one night. I hadn't screwed the cover on tight enough. It fell off and broke in pieces. And I bought it a month ago!!!!!
2,"perfect,if you don""t go out in the traffic.",Great little lights.But they are better for younger people.I will need stronger lights next time.
2,Bottom of the barrel,"The 3-LED taillight is good. With blink and steady modes it gets the job done.The headlight is not an LED, and is rather dim even with fresh batteries. As other reviewers have said, the battery life is poor. Riding in near darkness is the only time you will even see the light emitted by the headlight, and if that's the case it obviously isn't emitting enough light to help you stay safe.Next time, I'm going to spend the extra $5 and get an LED headlight."
3,Battery Life Is Terrible,Back light works great but the front light drains batteries like crazy. You end up spending a fortune on batteries if you ride in the night often.
2,Other Planet Bike Lights are a lot better,"This was the first planet bike light that I ever bought and i was not too happy with it so it was almost my last one. This one just doesn't really cut it. It's not very bright and the run time on the batteries is not that long. The blinky works well but the headlight just doesn't cut it. A better option would bePlanet Bike Beamer 1 and Blinky 3 LED Bicycle Light SetYes it costs a few dollars more but it's a whole lot more brighter, lasts longer and it's easier to put fresh batteries in and take old batteries out.I also useDown Low Glow Lighting Kit - Two Tubes-Envy(green)for side visibility at night."
4,Useful but could be better,"This price effective combo was big safety improvement over nothing, but the front light brightness is insufficient for night time rides. Wish the front had a flashing option. For the high performance riders their may be few ounces of unnecessary battery weight, but I prefer the standard battery sizes. Installation may be a challenge for some riders."
2,Not too bright...,"...not me, but the light. The battery needs changing too often also. If I had it to do over, I'd go with an LED."
3,Blinky is ok but headlight too dim,I really like the blinky on this one but the headlight is too dim for riding at night or early morning. I think it is a good choice though if you are still searching for the best headlights for your bike.
2,Not worth it,"If you're a fiction writer that needs a general overview of safecracking methods, then this book might work for you. A professional locksmith, however, will find little of value, whereas the inaccuracies and misinformation contained within spell disaster for the trainee who accepts them at face value.The only ones who might profit from this book are petty criminals who aspire to become safecrackers themselves. The three pages of tryout combinations and the destructive-entry methods might get a crook inside a container, provided he or she has plenty of time and isn't concerned with noise. In most cases, however, it will just mean more work for the locksmith who gets called out to open the safe after a bungled attempt."
5,Janice Vancleave's A+ Projects in Astronomy,"Any high school or junior high school student will want this book for science fair experiments and ideas. It takes you through the fascinating world of astronomy and all of it's mysteries, movements, and eccentricities. The best part is that each topic is accompanied with a sample experiment followed by questions and answers. You'll have great science fair success with this book!"
3,Really good info,"This a really good book even though it is a short read. I think I read it twice in a day. There is a lot of information within it even though it is so short. He gives plenty of suggestions for further work and what could be done. However, it does seem like just a book that clarifies A.O. Spare's works. Which is not a bad thing, it just seems as if he could have offered some new information along with it. I do recommend it though! Especially if you are looking to make your own system."
5,BECOME A REAL SORCERER!!,"this book is the real deal!!it teaches you how to create your own system of sorcery that means something to YOU which is the best way to create REAL magick!the methods in this book are to be taken SERIOUSLY,such as commanding spirits etc.THIS IS NOT FOR DABBLERS!!!! I REPEAT,THIS IS NOT FOR DABBLERS!!!! the proof of the effectiveness of this book is the fact that it's almost always sold out on amazon and that some unscrupulous sellers on amazon market place sell it for upwards of $200.00!! i had to order my copy directly from the publisher, dagon productions and i'm glad i did! i only paid $15 (thanks doug!).my advice is if you can't get it from amazon for cover price,or from an amazon marketplace seller at a REASONABLE price order it directly from the publisher."
1,Crossed Wires,"There is a bad error in the reviews for this book.All of the reviews for THIS TITLE about AUSTIN OSMAN SPARE have been confused with a different book by the same titlewritten by an author named Mace.Now,while this book utilizes material by Spare,the reviews that you see are NOT for the book shown that is ABOUT Spare.The IHOtitle in question is a critique of spare's art with with comparisons of some work that he supposedly plagiarized from other artists.It contains NO magical training or techniques.BE AWARE OF THIS if you are looking at this title!I THINK that this discrepancy by Amazon with the reviews may be an honest mistake,and should be corrected.But if youbuy the IHO title looking for occult instruction,you will be disappointed.Beware!The symbols have been confused!"
3,An inefficient predator,"The author has fallen into the trap of dividing the animal world into herds and preditors. Ecologically the most sucessful preditors have been pack hunters. If he had understood this, he might have developed his argument for Promethian Satanism more convincingly. As it is, he has missed the mark with regard to love. No K-selected species can endure with out it, since it allows for the investment in progeny. His view that to a Luciferan the ultimate predation is predation of God, I found odd, since I haven't found many on the Dark Path who take God seriously. On the positive side,this book does point out the distain many feel for agape. It was a valiant attempt, and the logic sound, in that, the conclusions did flow from the premises. A better grasp of Ecology should improve his next book."
1,A very shallow exposition based on conjecture and error.,"After finally obtaining a copy of this text I was inundated with material that, at times perilously threatened to veer into accuracy, only to save its obscure goal by darting away into the least practical hypothesis presentable.The author either has no idea about Luciferan practices or actually is a most devoted one attempting to save the tradition from the ignorant by jumbling and clouding the perceptions of others while making a pretty penny off their back. I am only grateful that I borrowed the text instead of purchasing it.All in all a total waste of perfectly good paper and ink."
3,"No good maps, no travel options","Not bad but I would have preferred a few more options for self tours, I thought that is what lonely planet was all about. Most of the time they recommend spending 3 weeks in each town to fully experience things, unfortunately that is no help to the average 2 week vacationer. Also no good maps, but better maps are available in other travel guides so I might look around before buying this book."
1,Disappointing,"I normally really like Lonely Planets guides but this one just is not that good.They could have gotten some more out of the way places,they could have explored some of the more remote and well kept secrets that abound in Scotland."
4,Lonely Planet Scotland,"It was an o.k. overview. The bias of some of the writers, though, seemed to come through, with tips on the best pubs and bars and higher priced restaurants but less on castles, ruins, abbeys, economical b&bs.; Lonely Planet has always helped me economize when traveling with less expensive,though quirky accommodations and restaurants, so I was not completely satisfied with what this one had to offer.In addition, it was not as user friendly as some other publications, necessitating one to jump around from map to map when planning a tour itinerary."
3,a little disenchanted,"I am a huge fan of lonely planet guidebooks. One's purchased for Hawaii and New Zealand were AWESOME!!! Contained all the routine spots and many, many less known great adventures. Also, every place to stay and eat was clearly identified as to which the author(s) considered the best. This guidebook is a bit less updated than either of those were with the last printing being 2004 - maybe that's some of the difference. Right now, I'm feeling that a may need a second guidebook to make sure I get the most out of the trip."
1,Cost-prohibitive,"No memory, so the slightest movement of the player causes it to skip. Drains batteries at a voracious rate. At least it has provision for an AC adaptor (the Colby does not), but the pin would not remain in contact with the jack unless I squeezed it. Colby, GPX, Jwin--mass-produced lightweight plastic that, if it works, does so erratically and briefly. Even if the players were free, the cost in frustration and disappointment is becoming too high a price to pay. Either the Chinese are getting a chuckle out of shipping these to Americans or are as perplexed as I am why we (I) continue to purchase them."
3,Jwin Electronics personal CD player,"I got this because my old CD player cannot cope with electrical interference when it is playing in the cup holder on our treadmill and because the Amazon photo shows easily accessible controls. This player has no shock memory. When moved even slightly it stops playing, but when things settle down it resumes where it left off. However, it is not affected by our treadmill's electrical emissions. Musically, its lower frequency response, especially pipe organ pedal bass, is somewhat less than upmarket players. It is satisfactory for its intended purpose (providing music while I am on the treadmill) and good value for money. Great service from the seller - fast shipping, and it was well packed."
1,JUNK !!!,This item worked for 1 day just a few hours. It was cheap enough but I expected to get more use out of it before it died !
1,You get what you pay for...,Tried to save a few bucks...big mistake.Featherweight plastic construction. Laser started untracking after 1 week of use.Save yourself the headache and just buy the Sony instead!
3,It skips easily,"I bought this to use when I am on a treadmill. It works, but it skips just from the mild vibration of the treadmill. And I certainly can't carry it while I'm walking. Also, it doesn't come with a power cord, so batteries are the only option. It's OK, but I wouldn't buy it again."
4,AWESOME!!!!,this cd player works well and is totally worth the $.it's a little touch sensitive though. i took a point off because the first one of these i bought came broken. Amazon is totally great about that kind of stuff though. you just report the problem and they replace it free.
2,written in 1 hour and it shows,the book be short and it be quick to read. nothing much can be said about it besides being boring and has almost nothing to do with the game. it's as if the writer couldn't be bothered to take the time to even study the game. i study more for my social studies class than mr. mesta. but at least it be short. i wasn't too disappointed because i didn't pay for the book.
3,Tragic,"While I have enjoyed Kevin's work on Star Wars, this is another example of what NOT to do when creating a line of novels based on your game franchise. You should NOT hire writers who have no interest nor familiarity with the subject matter. If Kevin J. Anderson were an avid StarCraft player he would have a much more vested interest in this game and would have learned tons more about small details that make it such a great universe. I would recommend skipping this book unless you want it for your collection and just downloading The Antioch Chronicles, a mod for the games that stays true to the universe without being boring or flagrantly WRONG on what has gone before. You'll find it much more entertaining."
1,"PLEASE, AVOID THIS BOOK","Look, If you value your money, you will avoid this book. I wanted to love this book! I really did! But as I kept reading it became more of a chore to read than anything else. I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, but please, really if you dont want to waste seven bucks: AVOID THIS BOOK. I would much rather recommend the warcraft series rather than this one, or better yet, play the game!!"
2,"No, seriously.","This book is as bad as Stacraft can get in a written form.There is not much I can add to the other reviews here, however, I can only support their claims.This book is just written in such a way that discards anything remotely accurate about Stacraft. The whole 'epic' feeling about the three races fighting each other fails in such a way that makes me feel bad, and all I did was read the book--Seriously, there's only one interesting thing about this book, and it's the 'new alien created by the Xel'Naga' thing that appears at the end, which is, in fact, what the three races are fighting for.Yeah, that's it, so, I just saved you a lot of time--now don't read this book, stay away from it.Oh, I wish I had never bought it--or read it, for that matter.Lets just say it isn't even canon, or if it is, lets just forget about this book and keep the major raw facts of what happened in it.In fact, someone get me a Biohazard label to put it on the book."
1,WHAT?! Are these reviewers crazy?!,"How can you give this book 3 or 4 stars, unless you were being paid to give it a good review?! Let's get this straight, you can't learn anything about Starcraft from this book. This book isn't a real Starcraft book. It's also written like it's done by a seventh grader. The first book was okay, but this book ""Shadow of the Xel'Naga"" was a waste of time. There was also NOTHING about the Xel'Naga! Want to know how stupid and comic book-like this book was? Here's an example. (spoiler) >>>> The characters who died come back to life in the end for a stupid happy ending because, they weren't really dead -- although they got absorbed and digested to become nothing!"
3,"Good book, but could be MUCH better","When I first saw this book, I was real excited. I thought it would revolve around the protoss (my favorite race) since it had a protoss on the front. But I was wrong. It mostly revolves around the terran, which greatly disappointing me. The characters weren't too great either. I enjoyed the book, but it's basically because it was a starcraft book, and I like the game. The ending was a little wierd, along with the main plot. Honestly, if they put a protoss on the front, shouldn't the protoss be the main characters? This book isn't even based on the game! That was incredibly disappointing. Really, there isn't anything GOOD about the book except the title."
1,For ages 3 and up,"Reading this was like playing Monopoly - with yourself! And with only the estates between Go! and Jail. It's short, unfulfilling and boring.The characters are cardboard stereotypes and the action is boring. If they wanted a science fiction writer, why couldn't they get a real one like Timothy Zahn?"
1,"Bad writing, boring story.","To put it frankly, this book stinks. It's not only the worst Starcraft book in the series, but it's the worst book I ever remember reading. The battles are unexciting and unrealistic - which would be okay if it even resembled a Starcraft battle - which it didn't. Thank god I read the other books first or else I wouldn't have ever read another Starcraft novel again. Read the first and third novel (""Liberty's Crusade"" and ""Speed of Darkness""). Be wise and skip this one."
4,OK book-- Great for Starcraft fans,"With the hope of a Starcraft 2 looming over the horizon, anything Starcraft related should spark interest in a true Blizzard fan. This book, although not as good as the other two in the series, is a fun read and a must to any Starcraft player. When ranking the book, I am naturally going to give it high ratings because of my love for the Starcraft plot. Despite that, however, I do feel this is a good book and provides readers with a great deal of excitement. The plot begins with the discovery of a Zel'naga (however it's spelled) temple. Zerg, Protoss, Dark Templar and Terrans converge on the location in an epic struggle to control the strange object. This book does not further the plot of Starcraft, but it is definitely a fun read to any Starcraft enthusiast."
4,Book is good,I like this book because it says more about the terran zerg and protoss and it was cool and im no god at reviews ha ha ha ha ha ha
3,Average read Nr. 2,"The second book of the 'StarCraft' series is different from the first one.It isn't as linear as 'Liberty's Crusade' and doesn't try to squeeze its story somewhere in the original game plot as the first book did unsuccessfully and irritatingly even.Some parts of 'Shadow of Xel'naga' are really not bad and entertaining but I found two annoying flaws.The first one is that the book very often tends to repeat itself. The chapters are very short and feature lots of different characters and therefore the author is constantly repeating what had happened and what someone had felt. On and on and on... Like a schoolmate crawling to write the required amount of words for an essay.The second minus - the very end is too fairy-talish. Too happy. Verdant meadows and reincarnated people? Come on... 'StarCraft' Is not a cartoon for children or a tale before going to sleep.And so, it's another average sci-fi book."
3,MEH......,"i'm a little dissapointed, i chose the book to do a book report, and i wasn't very impressed. I havn't read libertys crusade or speed of darkness, but i hear there good hopefully better tha this one ."
4,Good job. This would make a great movie.,"A lot of people didn't like this book because the story has nothing to do with what happens in the game, but in my opinion that's what makes this book better than the first one. This book goes beyond the basic battles of the game and depicts the kind of life the civilians in StarCraft universe would live. The husband-wife team created new creatures and tried to explain certain things about Zerg. Some points they make are very interesting, some I wish they'd never done. They build Edmund Duke's character a lot better than Jeff Grubb did. They don't follow the combat rules of the game very strictly and that makes a more realistic and enjoyable battle scene.The book starts out very interesting and the ending is also good. However, the middle section is a little monotonous. I'd like to conclude by saying that this book would make a very nice Hollywood blockbuster."
2,disappointing,"I was expecting much more from this book than the last based on the other reviews it received, but I found myself frustrated by the childish writing style and utterly uninteresting characters. Not everything needs to be described ""..like.."". I might have been reading a Hemingway novel, the way every sound and smell was being related to something else. Space opera really doesn't need such details, I believe.I felt no sympathy towards the community of victims, perhaps because their story was so broken up. Star Wars can get away with alternating stories between chapters because the characters are actually ones you care about, but I think it utterly failed here.In short, I was very disappointed with this book. I had expected much more from Kevin Anderson, given his ability to adapt to existing storylines. I suppose if this book was targeted towards teenagers (who form the majority of Starcraft players), it might explain a lot, but where were the characters we knew and actually cared about?"
3,Not entirely bad,"I think the biggest problem with this novel is that there are too much detailed descriptions on the things that any devoted Starcraft player would know too well already. One thing is the author spent too many words describing how a Zerg colony was developed and how the units of three races operate. I don't think those detailed are necessary because we are able to learn them from the game's manual. If the author has cut down those details, then this story could be better and enjoyable. However, I think this book could be good for the people that have not yet have experienced the Starcraft universe or anyone that is just beginning in playing the game.I was able to enjoy the story more after getting past all those descriptions. Also, I have not played Starcraft for a year or two, and it made me to want to play the game again. The battles in the book were exciting enough for me, and it's not all that unbearable, I believe."
1,This book is an abomination,The plugs in the reviews must be plants. This book is a disgrace to the power and prestige of the StarCraft canon.
3,Average in every way,"Now, I will say that I agree that this book does NOT follow the lore of Starcraft well. I noticed this within the first few chapters. So I pretty much pretended I knew nothing of all the lore of Starcraft. Most people seem to REALLY WANT it to be strict on this, and I think that hurts any enjoyment that can be had from this. Most reviewers seem almost emotionally hurt that it wasn't all that they wanted.Now as for the book itself. It was pretty much average in every way. It had a typical story line. It even had a fairy-tale ending that just kind of left me a bit bewildered as to why it HAD to be a happy ending; it sort of hurt the flow of the book (what little flow there was).There is some enjoyable chapters, mainly the first half of the book. But when the battle begins, it just kinda falls apart.It was good enough for me to finish, but that's about it."
4,"A Reading of "" Merlin Enthralled""","Length:: 8:27 MinsI'm sorry that I cannot share in the unqualified encomia of the other reviewers here. I do regard Wilbur as a very good poet, but simply not of the first water, as explained in the video."
3,It's not so good,It's not worth for the money i have paid . Will get the better quality one for the less price in local stores . I won't recommend to buy it .
3,"Great Jeans, unless you get the Sanded Lead","I bought these jeans for my husband in sanded lead and blackened indigo. The indigo pair is wearing really well, but the sanded lead pair - not so much. The first time he wore the sanded lead jeans, his finger poked a hole through the fabric near the rear right pocket. We exchanged them for another pair and the same thing happened again. There is obviously some type of flaw in the sanded jeans, unless of course Lee means for you to poke your hole through the middle of the fabric (not a seam), and I can't recommend them to anyone. However, I gave the jeans 3 stars, because the blackened indigo are wearing really well and he has been very pleased with them."
2,"Rob from Chicago,IL gives this a so-so review...","I like Mr. Patrick's advice on money management and basic strategy, but the counting system is really hard to follow. What I mean by this is that his -2, +1 count system is ""mentally exhausting"" with regards to keeping an accurate count, and it is so easy to lose count if you are so much as distracted from the duty at hand. Personally, I prefer the Hi-Lo method myself because of its ease of use. You might want to avoid this tape."
5,Great Book,"I purchase many boooks and never read them, or I start and never finish. I read this one cover to cover. The examples are great. I was able to make everything demonstrated in this book. I learned all those advanced features I was wanting to learn. When I buy a manual for a computer program this is what I am looking for... I am keeping my eyes open for more books by these two authors... I have ever paint shop pro manual listed with amazon.com"
2,Do support Dressler's income by buying his supplements,"Do yourself a favor...if you are assigned this textbook go ahead and buy the Black Letter Outline series by Dressler even if you don't use it until closer to finals. It gives you what you need to know and simplifies things so that you don't have to search round and round for it in the textbook. It's unfortunate Dressler feels the need to sell his supplements and as a result has to make his textbook so crappy. And yes, it really IS that bad."
2,Buy a companion guide!,"The text is not a good tool for 1Ls to learn crim law by itself. Most of my classmates and I found the text to be poorly organized and written - especially for those just trying to grasp the intricacies of crim law. Probably a better book for studying statutory interpretation or philosophy of crim law. Prepare to become intimate with the MPC if you are assigned this text. I highly recomend a companion book for the text, one keyed to it such as Blackletter outline by Dressler or the Understanding Crim Law companion by Dressler. I used both and they saved me from utter confusion."
1,Worst Textbook in Law School,"I'm a 2L now, but I wanted to stop by and give my thoughts on this horrible book. There is entirely too much philosophy, as others have said. For the reviewer below, I don't want to offend you but most of us aren't in law school to spend long hours pondering over why we punish criminals. I just want to know the black letter law so that I can take an exam, score well, and hopefully get a decent job out of law school. This book is not helpful in any of the above.I couldn't believe some of the stuff I read in this book. More often than not, I found myself asking what place any of this stuff had in a Criminal Law text. You'll see what I mean when you start reading. Much of Dressler's ""teaching material"" consists glorified fables and short stories which really have only a tangential relation to the subject matter. I especially enjoyed his excerpt from Willa Cather's ""O Pioneers."" I nearly dropped my book in amazment after coming across that one."
1,subwoofer sucks,"I have purchased 1, which broke. then it was exchanged for a new one, which broke also. I had it hooked up to an 800w amp, which it should have been fine. it is not very loud when it works. the price wasn't bad, but if you can stay away you should."
4,Well documented story about little known subject,"Incredible story of survival, brutality and courage. The Jewish partisans were threatened not only by the Germans, but also by other partisan groups, internal dissention and the wary eye of the Red Army. How they were able to create an actual village in the forest and save so many people is mind-boggling."
5,A Story of Survival!,"The Bielski Brothers is a fascinating, unblelievably true account during the time of World War Two. After the second chapter i was hooked. The three brothers: Tuvia, Zus, and Asael demonstrate courage and defeat after escaping from the horrors of the Nazis. An outrage grew amongst the three brothers after their parents and loved ones were involved in a mass murder by the anti-seminists, causing them to hide within the trees,build a villiage in the forest, and save nearly 1,200 Jews (as much as Oskar Schindler) Making the woods a safe haven for Jews.The escapees are separated into groups of fighting men and non-fighting men, As they battle it out against the Nazis.Coming to the end, i would say The Bielski Brothers is a very good book. I strongly recommend it!!! ;)"
1,the ends don't justify the means,"they killed innocent jews even after they were liberated. another sad story of blind faith, absolute power corrupting absolutely and ""spin"".a book should be written about the family who suffered after the husband and father was shot over a pair of boots.how was it that they were allowed into america after being labeled war crimminals. did someone look under the table?"
1,A hero and criminal,"Wonder how they described woman and man massacred in Naliboki, who, after being regularly robbed of food and property, organised self-defence and were massacred by Soviet partisans, including Bielski group. Or about AK soldiers killed by Bielski partisans because of Soviet orders."
1,Huh?,"Hello, has any one read the news how the younger brother recently swindled a 93 roman catholic survivor of the holocaust out of $250,000.00 and tricked her into a nursing home in Warsaw? This doesn't fit my idea of a ""hero"". Don't get swindled by buying this book"
1,Such Heroism and Bravery,"Shame about the alleged (according to Polish investigative agency) massacre of 120+ innocent residents of Naliboki, Poland. How about the lone surviving brother and his recent kidnapping conviction. Anything else out there? How long will it take before people wake up to all this nonsense - long enough for others to $profit$ off the reader and film goer."
4,Bielsky Book,"After seeing the movie ""Defiance"" which is about the Bielsky Brothers that saved approximately 1200 Jews during the Nazi regime, I had to read the story. It is a triumphant story that takes you through the hardships and survivor techniques that they used. It is a heart wrenching story that allows one to feel weak and helpless. Through their perserverance and will to survive, makes this story a must read. I would encourage everyone and anyone to read about the Bielsky Brothers. It is a shame that they were never acknowledged for their resistance."
3,Correction in paperback edition,"In my earlier review dated August 12, 2003, I noted the following error:""Unfortunately, Duffy repeats (at page 232) an erroneous and longsince discredited accusation against General Tadeusz Bor-Komorowski, commander of the Polish underground Home Army (ArmiaKrajowa or AK): 'Indeed, General Bor-Komorowski, the AK's topcommander, issued an order on September 15, 1943, calling for theextermination of Jewish partisan groups, which he regarded as bandits.'""This allegation is false. General Bor-Komorowski did issue hisOrder No. 116 of September 15, 1943, which ordered action againstbandits, but there was no mention whatsoever of Jews or Jewishpartisan groups.""I am pleased to report that this erroneous allegation has been removed from the paperback edition.Charles ChotkowskiFairfield, Conn."
1,Disappointing choice,"I've used several different brands of travel guides in Europe, the U.S. and Asia and have always found the Fodor's offerings to be comprehensive and useful. That is the reason I'm so disappointed in this book. As a travel guide it is not inexpensive but it does not contain such basic information as lodging options near major train stations, suggestions for low cost lodging away from major tourist haunts, the quirky eating options I've always found in Fodor's other books, or the standard opening times for major sites. For example, Vatican City sites are not listed except in the most superficial way. And, how jaded a traveler must you be to consider St. Peter's a plain church with no important art, as this writer describes it? Michelangelo's Pieta is there! They should have spent less on glossy color photos and more on useful information.If you're going to Italy get a different book."
1,Do not buy this item,"I recieved this item from my husband for Christmas. One month later the heat and vibration feature would not work. Amazon replaced the item immediately. I have had the replacement for three months and it has now started leaking. Not just a small leak- pouring water all over my hardwood floors!!!! I am now trying to return the replacment but the time allowed has expired. Apparently the expiration date was three days before I reveiced the replacement- are you kidding??. I am now stuck with this item that obviously has issues and I cannot receive a refund for it. I am very disappointed in the quality of this product and Amazon. I would expect the ""return period"" to start AFTER I receive the replacement. This was not one of these products that had problems but two in a four month period."
2,Noisy foot bath,"This device was very disappointing:- very noisy, even when you don't put your feet in there,- low water fill level,- hardly any massage movements, if it works at all- ""smart"" heat didn't work"
2,It vibrates...that's it.,"The title pretty much says it all. Its called a foot spa but all it does is vibrate, there aren't even bubbles. I don't know what i was expecting for $25 but it was a lot more than i got. The worst thing about it was that the parts that are supposed to be ""massaging"" a just little spikes that not only don't massage but hurt. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of is because technically it does something and i have really big feet and its the only thing big enough to soak them in. All in all its not worth $25 dollars by any stretch of the imagination if you know someone that is selling one 10 might be worth it."
4,Good deal,"Start using this one in Nov, living in Mid West, it keep warm in 15 minutes or more depending on how hot water you pour at beginning. The noise is acceptable, I even read paper while massage. I took one star since the vibration is not strong anymore when putting your feet inside."
3,Hard Plastic nubbies...,"I ordered this item because I know the name ""Dr. Scholl's"" and I needed a foot spa. When I got this set up and put my feet in it, the bottom of the spa is covered with HARD plastic nubbies... that I guess you are supposed to get used to, but it is like walking on rocks IMHO. The massage and warming functions work fine, I dont find it overly loud, and otherwise it is a fine product... but the plastic nubs on covering the bottom of the spa are not comfortable to keep your feet on for any length of time. I will probably cover them with a towel or some other softer material to help with my tender feet."
4,It Helps a Bit!,"This foot spa does help to make healthy but tired feet feel better. Do not expect much relief if you have a problem such as a heel spur. I like the attachments, my wife does not, but she does like the spa very much. Personally, I get similar satisfaction from the foot jets in my hot tub plus I get the benefits of the rest of the jets! The advantage of the foot spa is that you can use warmer water and you can add medication, (although medication is not recommended in the foot spa literature)."
2,Disappointed,"I received this product just a few days ago and was so excited that I couldn't wait to open it up and use it! However, the product was very disappointing. Not only did it not keep the water warm for more than one minute, the vibrations that are supposed to ""massage"" your feet only made a buzzing sound.I will be sending it back."
3,Small feet only,"The massage is very relaxing and soothing. My feet feel great after 10 minutes. I couldn't really tell if the 'heat' worked or not, but I'm leaning toward not. My biggest complaint is that it is made for very small feet. I have 9.5 mens size feet and they are too big for this unit and makes for some discomfort while using."
1,*** No soothing benefit whatsoever ***,Shame on Dr. Scholl's for putting their name on such a piece of junk. It does nothing more than just soaking one's feet in warm water. This product's primary fault is its very weak massage power. The weak vibration sensation is not even felt over the entire foot bed. Lame. Some reviewers think that this product's low cost justifies it's low performance. This is nonsense. $30 is a lot more than the ZERO benefit this product provides. This foot spa is a waste of space. Ours will be shuttled to Goodwill so that we can take the tax write-off.
2,not what it claims to do,It does not keep the water warm a advertised to do. If you want hot water for an extended period of time not the product for you.
4,Adequate Foot Spa,I bought this foot spa for my girlfriend for Christmas. I received it quickly even though it was the holiday rush and so far I haven't heard any complaints. I looked at several others and decided this was the best value.
3,works well - some cheap parts,This item works well but the massage wheels do not stay in place. Some cheaper versions do not have the same problem so I am a little disappointed.
1,Complete waste of money,"I ordered this online. While the shipping was awesome, the product didn't work AT ALL. My Hubby the little cleaner threw the box away so I couldn't return it. This was not their fault however when I order a product I would like for it to work. I wasted money on ordering this. Just a warning if you DO order this product please make sure everything is there and that is in working condition."
3,"DECENT PRODUCT, BUT I'VE HAD BETTER...MUCH BETTER.","THE PRODUCT WORKS WELL BUT THE MECHANISM TO HEAT THE FOOT SPA DOESN'T KEEP THE WATER WARM. THE POINT OF A FOOT SPA IS TO PAMPER YOURSELF, NOT TO DO MOST OF THE WORK...IT DOES COME IN HANDY WHEN YOU WANT TO AVOID SPLURGING ON A DAY AT THE NAIL SALON."
2,Not what I expected,"The ""heat"" feature worked well enough but I did not experience any type of massage from this product. Perhaps the item I received was defective but when I filled it up with water and turned it on, it was very loud and had no massage feature."
4,"Decent, not comfortable for long periods of time","Barely netted a 4 star from me. Works ok, but has a couple annoyances:-not very deep. i know it's a 'foot bath', but i like to have my ankles submerged, too.-with the heat on, the bottom of your feet can get too hot-it has little nubs that your feet rest on, and they get annoying after a whileotherwise performs as expected, and i like it more than this review probably makes it seem."
3,It's Okay,"I was excited to get my foot spa until I used it. Some of the pieces did not fit well, the vibrate feature is a bit noisy but it's bearable and the water did not stay heated as indicated in the advertisement. To some that might be a small thing but if you're paying for something with specific qualities you expect to be able to utilize them. The tub does indicate how much water you are suppose to place inside. That may or may not be problematic for individuals who want to really soak there feet (depending on your foot size). Overall, it was quite an experience. I do want to purchase another one, however I'm more skeptical now than before."
2,Dr Scholl's ??,"I purchased this strictly by NAME BRAND recognition.This is a really mediocre product. The bath barely gets warm, it lightly vibrates but not much else.I just don't think this product does much. A foot ""SPA"" it is not."
1,No !!!,"No bubble bath. Heating water no good, Vibration/Massage is low and not useful. Cheap plastic and uncomfortable leg space. I felt that a plastic bucket is better and more convinient."
3,It's OK,"It's OK for the price, but I don't think it's all that effective. A little noisy, but it didn't do much for my feet."
1,Does not heat the water,I was under the impression that this foot bath would heat the water or at least keep it hot. Does not do either.
5,DITTO!!,"I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer. This is a great drive. Very quiet, fast reading, just slide it in (even with the computer on)and go!. It comes with external power supply and usb cable to allow connection to all other computers, but these are not needed with the HP Media Ceter PC's"
3,Be Very Careful!,"I loved this drive, used it all the time! I had almost daily use with it with my HP laptop and windows media center. It was slick as can be for about 5 months, then it crashed. I was on the phone with HP in Puerto Rico, LA, Canada, India (the rudest), and Argentina technical support. they kept bouncing me around making me mad. I kept repeating the serial number over and over to marginal English speaking people. Then out of desperation, I called sales and got woman who told me they only guarantee the drives or 21 days out of the box. She tried to sell me a new one. Buyer beware!"
3,Nominal improvement over lower tech rivals,"The Gennum nXZEN stands out as the most advanced headset on the market, using a dual microphone array and substantial DSP horsepower to reject ambient noise and enhance sound quality. It is an unambiguous improvement over less advanced on-the-ear headsets in the same price range, but falls far short of long-boom headsets that put the microphone next to the user's mouth. Implications that one could be heard over construction equipment and factory floors are somewhat overstated.The headset suffers a bit in comparison to similarly priced headsets in terms of build quality. The UI is quirky and a bit hard to master. The ""stereo corded headphones"" option doesn't make sense to me. The noise-isolating in-ear protuberance may cause comfort issues, doesn't seem to be much of an improvement over headsets that simply offer sufficient volume adjustment (which is a common failure) and makes the headset hard to put in a pocket without scraping off bits on extraction."
4,Gennum nXZEN Plus 5500 Bluetooth Headset Extreme,The bluetooth did not work for me but there was nothing wrong with the item. The seller was great and the shipping was fast. It was a great experience it is the product didn't work for me I wanted a different style.
1,NxZen Plus 5500 Pure Rubbish,"I've work in telecommunication for over 30 years. I rely on my cell phone for my work. I'm very disappointed in the NxZen Plus 5500. The sound quality both sending and receiving are extremely poor. The controls do not function as advertised. After dropping numerous important calls, over several days, I got so mad I turned it off and went back to a much cheaper Nokia. The Nokia cost me $45.00 and works like a champ. The NxZen cost me more than $125 and is pure junk."
4,Noise cancellation that really works!,"I've tried several Bluetooth headsets claiming to cancel background noise. Until this one, I've been left wanting. The GENNUM nXZEN Plus really works! I have a sports car with a loud engine noise and with this headset, callers haven't complained as they did with previous ones. Only four stars though because the Bluetooth connection with my Blackberry 8703e gets dropped once a day when its idle. Also, I take many calls throughout the day using my nXZEN and find it essential to recharge the battery every night - your mileage may vary."
2,Review of Gennum nXZEN Plus Wireless Bluetoothe,"The headset did have better background noise reduction than other devises used. However, the inner ear attachments came off far too easy. The piece that connects the devise to the ear has now broken -- ordinary use (not dropped, crushed, etc.) -- less than one month use and therefore the devise can no longer be used. I will be sending it back -- maybe the service will make up for the product failure."
3,Good Game Set,"Good mix of classic vintage Flyers and more recent years.Can't go wrong with this DVD set.Only issue is there is no games with Eric Lindros. This is who I grew up with and was disappointed that I couldn't relive the ""Big E"" days."
3,Almost Perfect,"I'm withholding 5 stars from this otherwise outstanding compilation simply because of the obvious flip of the bird the Flyers gave to Lindros by *not* including at least one game from his Legion of Doom days with the franchise.The longstanding Flyers/Lindros battle notwithstanding, the fact remains, regardless of Flyers management's personal and professional differences with the Lindros family, Eric Lindros was an integral part of the Flyers' meteoric rise from the ashes when he was part of the team. Blowing off his contribution to the team from that time doesn't undo the wins or history."
3,Not Quite,From the description I was led to believe I was ordering a single 1 oz. bottle of drops for which I have been searching. What I received was two 0.5 oz. bottles of drops which I can find anywhere. Needless to say I was disappointed.
3,Be Aware,"I ordered this product in the 1 ounce configuration (the picture showed it as one 1 ounce bottle) because I cannot get the 1 Ounce configuration locally anymore. I was willing to pay the one dollar more it cost to get the 1 ounce bottle. When it got delivered, it was ACTUALLY two 1/2 ounce bottles. Granted, that is 1 ounce but it was Misrepresented, and I could have gotten those locally for less. It was too much hassle to return them, so I kept them, but just BE AWARE."
2,bumpy stepping down memory lane,"this collection is a tough one to take. i, for one, love the fact that some of the tracks are obviously not remastered to take out the hiss and pop of vinyl. it takes me back to my teenage days in chicago going to house parties with my 25 cent plugger. that is a priceless memory that cannot be bought and i appreciate the producers for helping me re-live it down here in the ozarks.but what i don't appreciate, especially since so many of the artists that we step to are one-hit wonders, are the lack of performer credits on these cds. not cool. if someone is doing this without permission, get the permission!!!i know that basic black and jeffree recorded the songs on this collection. those are songs that i love and wanted to have on my mp3 player. but not everyone knows this. you have to give credit where credit is due, mr. producer."
5,Secrets of the Wealth Makers,"I found Michael Lane's book ""Secrets of the Wealth Makers"" to be very informative and an easy read. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in accumulating wealth or understanding how to protect and transfer their existing wealth."
4,Average,"This book does not convey any new ideas, but is a good overall summation of some very sound wealth creation techniques and theories."
2,"Logitech is better, but not as available.","I have a logitech 3-button mouse which is FAR better than this one. I'd get more of them, but Logitech is not making them anymore, and I can't find them online so easily.The Belkin mouse is OK if you MUST have a USB 3-button mouse, but the mouse ball gums up VERY fast (several times each day), and the pointer control/precision is poor. I work in 3D modeling/CAD/Maya, and a 3-button mouse is a must have. Currently, as far as I can tell, Belkin is the only company making a USB 3-button mouse. I'd like to say thanks for doing that, but please make it of higher quality. I'd give my right arm for an optical USB 3-button mouse (well, if I gave my right arm, it would be pretty well useless, wouldn't it?)SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE AN OPTICAL 3-BUTTON MOUSE!!!!!!The belkin is OK, but not a great mouse."
3,mouse in the house,the price was right. works fine. I set the middle button to page down and works like a scroll wheel.
1,a means to perpetuate illiteracy,"Although I agree that this was a compelling story, the grammar and spelling in this novel serve only to perpetuate the divide between the low-income and average American families. This story not only inspires a lifestyle change, but also indirectly validates our youth's disregard for education and the importance of literacy - eliminating the benefit of creating such a motivational book.Author's should be more responsible. Although dialect and slang can be found in many books, abbreviations such as ""it'z"" are completely unnecessary and irresponsible. Holmes should have acted more like the role model (s)he was pretending to be when writing this book."
3,Kinda Boring,"This really wasn't Shannon's forte of writing to me. The whole book in general bored me, I read it in 12 hours but that was just to get it over with. I'll always be a fan of his, but I was very disappointed with this story."
4,Never Go Home Again.....................,"This book was very good. It talked about a young man name Corey who was raised by a two parent family and how he notice is friends making money holding drugs for older guys. Corey being young and seeing his friend making money pulled him right into the game. I felt for Corey his family loved him but Corey went down the wrong path. Corey mom, oh how I felt for her at the end."
3,"Okay, Not really his best work",I like Shannon Holmes his books are usually very interesting. But this book i didn't too particularly care for. This book seems as thought it was written for young urban males. It was okay but i liked Bad Girlz and B-More Careful a lot better.
3,B-MORE IS WAAY BETTER STILL,I became a fan of Shannon's when I read his first book. This book was just ok to me. But if your a fan of urban street books then I strongly suggest DON'T KNOCK THE HUSTLE by Stacy Nelson. Shannon and Stacy ought to pair up and bring out a novel. I love reality based books and Stacy's definitely brought the real. I hope Shannon comes just as raw with his next one.
3,Not what was expected!,This book is not like the other two books by Shannon Holmes. It more so tells a story of someones life and what you should not do to get caught up. I felt like I was on the playground watching a street fight or just seeing kids shot the breeze. Shannon Holmes to me tells stories better about women and their street problems. This character Corey bored the heck out of me.
5,Sunny Weather!,"I think Sunny Weather is amazing, the lyrics, the music, everything! I think they write the kind of music that everyone can enjoy!"
5,Great rates for shiping and handling,"Normally I get my fish supplies from Dr's Fosters, but now their shipping and handling rates are over 10.00. The filters arrive in a few days in good condition and are just like the ones from Dr's Fosters."
5,Exactly what i need,"These came in a big bag, and there was carbon that leaked out allover. None were missing any, but it seems like they have been exposed for a while. I rinsed them off in my sink, and then put them in my filters, i have a saltwater tank, and nothing died, and everything seems fine. I will buy again, will last me for about 6 months. Great price compared to In Store prices. ABout 15 dollars just for a 2 pack..."
5,lots of filters at a great price,Fast delivery. They came in one box and in a large plastic bag (Bulk Pack). Just what I ordered.
5,Without words...,"Bar none, this is the most beautiful, amazing, and mezmorizing concert video i have ever seen. why it has only 4 stars bewilders me! never before have i seen such an amazing thing...check it out, its worth it! NIN 4ever!"
3,Expect nothing more then live footage.,"The live footage on this DVD? Awesome. It felt like being at one of thier concerts. The picture, sound, and overall quality of the footage is superb.That said, I was somewhat disappointed that there wasn't much else. You'd think a 2 DVD collection would maybe have at the very least some commentary by Trent, or perhaps some info about the band or something else of interest. Nope. All you get is the concert's director's commentary, secondary angles (excess footage) and some stills (more excess footage). After recently buying the Smashing Pumpkin's DVD, which was only 1 DVD and had about 10 times the content, I must say I felt as if this DVD was lacking. Unless you like lots and lots of footage and nothing else."
3,....could have been better,"In no way was I fan of the Fragile album. And the whole point of this DVD seems to be geared towards the new material. Some old songs are thrown in, but they are far and few between. Some of their best songs like ""Reptile"", ""Something I Can Never Have"", ""Happiness In Slavery"", ""Heresy"", and ""Ruiner"" are all absent and nowhere to be found. Also I feel as if the whole thing could be on 1 DVD instead of 2. I had to shell out more money for probably another DVD that wasn't necessary. Overall only get it if you collect NIN material, or if you have money."
3,Not all it could have been,"While NIN fans should really get this, I was dissapointed when I found out it didn't include any of the Fragile official videos, only the concert footage. The only produced video it contains is in a secret menu and it's a video that Trent never wanted tho public to see cuz its bad, how ironic that the only video from Fragile is the one so bad Trent never published it?!The audio and camera work is superb, when you watch this you are getting pure quality, by no means was their concert taped with home camcorders."
3,sound is great - but the actual concert is stupid,buy the cd - forget about the video - it is pretty stupid - I am a big nin fan - but - this dvd is ridiculous
3,DVD Review,"TWO DISCSDisc One contained excellent concert footage, depicting the ""old"" NIN in action. 5 stars.Disc Two was an on-the-road tour documentary with some concert footage mixed in. Bad camera operation, grainy film quality, tin-can sound. Although it contained some great behind the scenes footage of T. Reznor and NIN it's not worth more than 1 star."
4,An accurate depiction of the Tour,"If you didn't have a chance to see this tour live, seeing this DVD will give you a very good viewing of what you missed. An innovative stage and lighting was the highlight of the concert. Be sure to use the alternate viewing angle for the middle three songs, La Mer, The Great Below, and The Mark Has Been Made, because of the great effects used for these songs. The concert is what you would expect it to be with them playing most of their hits with a leaning toward the songs off The Fragile."
3,Nothing Beats Live,"I bought this dvd because my boyfriend has never seen NIN live, and the last time i saw them was in 1994 (the ""Downward Spiral"" tour). It's good, but not _that_ good. I really wanted to see the special effects of the screen coming down during ""Hurt,"" like it was in 1994, but I guess he stopped doing that bit... He didn't even do the ""smashing the keyboard"" bit he usually does.On the up side, the description is very accurate- it is exactly what was described in the listing, but I was disappointed, none the less. It really is a bunch of home movies, which, for me, takes away from the experience because it's not like being there (not that a dvd could reproduce that, but still...)I thought there was more focus on the crowd than the band, and I can see those people any day of the week on the bus. I wanted to see the band, not the fans!Overall, I must emphasize that the description provided is accurate, but nowhere near a microsom of the real thing."
4,NIN have done it again - forgot about european fans,Excellent live DVD... As expected by almost everyone familiar with the perfectionism of Trent Reznor.Only complaint is that the DVD is not released in Europe - the same problem as Closure when that came out.You would believe that a band of this magnitude would be able to make a european version as well.
5,Best Concert DVD I've ever seen.,"I was partially dreading this release after the horrid Closure VHS set. On THAT package, the sound was audience recording bootleg quality. This, however, is PERFECT. The sound quality is impeccable. The show is amazing. And the video is unmatched. I've never seen a concert video which truly captured the essence of what it was like to be at a concert before. This one did it. My only gripe is that it's two discs, and there's no reason at all for it to be two discs. The whole thing could have fit onto one. But with a show this great, I can't really complain too loudly."
3,NIN DVD,"The DVD is OK, but who ever recorded it did not do a very good job,it does not sound good at all, and I have an Elite system with all the bells and whistles, still couldn't make it sound any better.."
1,"Not what I was expecting, what a disappointment ....","I was looking foreward to some of the interviews they played on MTV as a preview to the release of this DVD, but they didn't seem to make it here, also the promotional videos from the album 'The Fragile' would have also been very nice, they were omited was well. To me that was a real dissapointment!! Another thing, and this is a major complaint -- this is a two DVD set with the cabiliblty of having 4 hours of material. Between the two dvd's there's only about 2 hours total of material including the comentary.Although the concert footage was so good that it does make it a must have for hard core fans like myself. The picture quality was near perfect and the audio was loud and clear in a 5.1 digital mix. There's also 4 songs that the camera angle can be changed for different viewing. Save some money and get 'Closure' by NIN on video.NIN lowers the bar on DVD releases, what a scam!!"
1,BIG NIN FAN - - - BUT THIS DVD DISAPOINTED ME,I like Trent Reznor work but he let it me down with this dvd if you already have the cd don't make the same mistake i made don't buy the dvd i assure you the cd is much better than the dvd Trent Reznor doesn't offer anything new here is a waste of money the reason i bought it was because i was very impressed with marilyn manson god guns and government dvd and i was expecting same thing with and all that could have been i was so wrong
5,A GREAT LIVE CONCERT DVD,"A really well presented live concert, a little frustrating that it is split across two discs though... the sound has been well captured, and the songs sound interestingly different to those on the records that they are taken from. pretty pricey though, although the package is in a typically smart NIN style. the still gallery is huge! i tried the tip to access the hidden extras ("" Select the song ""Head Like a Hole"" on disc 2, at the ""11:20"" mark, hit the number ""7"", then, press ""Enter."" You will then be treated to a SECRET ""Easter Egg"" and or ""Hidden Extras"" menu."") as suggested below, but i can't get this to work... although i was able to obtain a wide angle for 'gave up'. can anyone help me here? if so, email me: ipi2m2n@leeds.ac.uk - thanx!"
4,NIN In All Digital Format,"This is an excellent DVD. It's amazing that this was shot entirely on miniDV, edited on Final Cut Pro, sound mixed with Pro Tools, and DVD created on DVD Studio Pro. Trent Reznor has been using Apple Mac Computers for a long time, and produced this DVD entirely on his Mac. Excellent video quality and the Dolby Digital 5.1 is simply amazing. The only other way to improve the sound is owning the DTS version."
1,"Two traps, zero moths caught.","I set up two traps in my home. After two weeks I checked the traps. Neither trap had caught a single moth. During that time, I noticed a number of clothes moths flying around the house. Bottom line, these traps are a waste of money."
5,Excellent for Learning Portraiture,"I have just purchased this book, and it is my favorite one on portraiture! The author gives excellent step by step instruction on painting portraits in all mediums...pastel, oil, or watercolor. Highly recommended!"
4,I like the approach,I am an intermediate artist and love to paint people. I have several books by portrait artists and this is one of my favorites. Chris teaches a good approach to portraits and shares a very workable palette. One of my reference books.
4,nibbler,I needed to do a small metal roof. The hitachi 16gauge nibbler worked great. Now I have a great to for metal work. Burke construction
1,"Not for more than 4"" cabinet pull","It is difficult to tell in the photo, but your cabinet pull or handle must not have a span greater than 4 inches (from screw to screw) or you cannot use this. Mine are sleek and contemporary and have a 5 inch span, which obviously doesn't work."
5,Sweet it is...,"I'm not sure I can find the words to describe my serious delight about this book, but I'll do my best. If I could have created the perfect book in my mind before I read this, I couldn't have imagined this book up - but it's what I would have wished for had I known I could. ... that doesn't sound clear...I've never considered myself a feminist, but this book helped expose the part of me that was deeply bonded to the community of what it means to be a woman. I didn't think about gardening before i read this book and it enticed me to GROW things. It's poetic, it's true personal stories (which are always my fav), it's about EARTH (which is always amazing), and it feels like a community. And it's educational.It is indeed sweet, in all matters of the word."
2,"Too Much Business, Not Enough Blood","I just finished reading Bloody Business by H. Paul Jeffers and I must say I was not terribly impressed. The Edward Gorey cover is fantastic and there are a few interesting stories, but not nearly enough to hold my interest. If you are interested in learning about the history of Scotland Yard - such as how the police department was originally set-up and who led it over the years - then you might find it very satisfying, but I was hoping for a bit more blood and guts."
4,Shoots and Scores,"Hooks galore on this album. Combo of rock and electronica - seamless, well produced and very intense throughout. Shoots the groove between hard rock and industrial pop without compromising an inch in either direction. Definitely worth checking it out for yourself."
3,Capable White Noise,"I'll liken The Mercury Drops' ""Animal Kingdom"" CD to the sound a refrigerator makes... the sort of stuff you don't really notice until it stops. Once the silence hits you, you realize how comforting the 'white noise' really was. Upon actually listening to the sounds and words, however, I was pleasantly surprised to discover a capable compilation that harkens back to what was daring and interesting about the music of the '80s. Just admit to the fact that you liked Thomas Dolby and Gary Neumann and allow yourself to enjoy ""Animal Kingdom"" as well."
3,Outdated,"The information was outdated, but I still got some helpful tips. I hope that the authors have rewritten the book and made it more contemporary. Most people don't use film anymore."
2,I should of listened to Arizona...,"Lackluster is exactly how I would peg this. And I felt the heroine did come off as premature. But! If you are into egocentric step-fathers, elude being the ton on-dit with a quickie marriage to the stoic mis understood Earl (or was he a Duke?), the typical foolish situation to bail out your idiot brother then by all means get this book it's a light easy read."
3,Lackluster,"This book was mediocre at best. The writing is excellent and the characters are consistent and likeable, but the plot is incredibly old and worn out. We have so many used Regency plot ideas: the marriage- because-of-compromise, the unconsummated-marriage-until-love-is-found, the spousal misunderstandings, and even the-pawned-jewelry-to-help-the-brother-but-don't-go-to-the-rich-husband-for-money scene. This book contained no surprises and ended as predictably as you can imagine."
3,Be Prepard to be Grossed out!!!!,"Mummies, Bones, and Body Parts, by Charlotte Wilcox, is not a good book to read before lunch. I give this book 3and stars because it was pretty good. It's about mummies and how they are found. It also tells how they were prepared for burial, and thousands of years later, where and why they were found or discovered.This book is an informational text, that means it can teach you things. I like learning about mummies and how they are found. Also, I like learning new things all the time.I don't think the author could have done anything better. I thought it was good just the way it is.When reading this book you can tell the author wrote this book because she has a passion for Egyptian after life. Also I think she wanted other people to get excited about what she likes."
4,A Fascinating Read,"Looking for a high-interest read for a reluctant grade 6-8 reader? This should do it! Stunning photographs of human remains accompany an interesting text. But this one isn't for the nightmare-prone. Make sure you read through the book to see that it is appropriate for the child you hand it to. The text addresses a variety of ways bodies become mummified, how bodies decay, how and why human remains are studied by scientists, burial customs, and also makes a case for respecting human remains. The book has some interesting science and supports the Investigation and Experimentation strand for grades 6-8, and the Earth and Life History standard for grade 7 (California Science standards)."
5,True Artists,"All of the musicians on the Melissa Kassel Quintet CD are true artists. It is a pleasure to finally hear a vocalist using her voice as an instrument, playing in and out of the rhythms and melodies of the other musicians. The original pieces are quite beautiful. Overall I find this CD a pleasure to own."
5,Great CD!,"What an amazing feat Melissa Kassel and her ensemble have acomplished with this brilliant c.d. Melissa's lines are imaginitive and sophisticated. This c.d comes as great refreshment to many bland, uncreative c.d's that seem to be popular lately. The band sounds splendid, and if you've never heard Melissa Kassel sing, be sure to check this out!"
1,Eh,"great musicians, but vocals so overly stylized that the whole project becomes boring. Jazz IS improvization, but too much of a good thing is just plain way toooo much."
5,awsome,This heat gun meets all of my expectations. It very handy to be able to set it on the built in stand. Being able to select the temperature is also very nice.
2,It's...OK I guess,It gets hot enough but there's no volume to the flow.The choice of using a short travel slider for temperature control makes it difficult to obtain a specific setting. They should have chosen a longer slider or gone to a rotational control. Since they have a digital temp readout they could have just put a + and - key on top so you could step the temperature up/down.All in all pretty disappointed particularly considering the cost.
3,An unusual use.,I use this heat gun to dry horses hooves after cleaning. Also to set an epoxy to harding the sole of the hoof. I have found it a bit difficult to set and hold the temperature that I need. Probably because I need it to stay pretty cool. It wants to heat up much hotter than I need. But on the other hand a non-variable heat source is much hotter and there is no way to make them cooler. Overall this gun works for the purpose with a little practice.
1,Not Worth It,"If anyone is considering purchasing this book, please, save yourself the agony. I have read the entire book, and walked away with little more than regret for buying the book. I strongly do NOT recommend this book due to it's lack of content, and creativity."
4,Straightforward and useful,"Starchild's book covers all the key concerns about citizenship and what avenues exist for obtaining a second. There are many useful applications for dual-citizenship in business and travel these days as our ever-shrinking world demands greater ease of movement across borders. Chapter 14 covers all the practical second nationalities and how you would go about acquiring them (if you qualify). If you travel a lot, if you need to go places that are ""verbotten"" for most Americans, if you just won the lotto and hope to shield a portion of it from the IRS, this book should be useful."
2,"Mostly theory, little practice","If you are interested in a long detailed history of the development of citizenship laws and the theories behind them, then this book is for you. If you are actually interested in getting a second passport, I would suggest you look elsewhere. The majority of the book is devoted to theory not practice: You may have a good understanding of how countries determine who is and is not one of them,..."
5,manners,book arrived on time and in better condition than I thought. Highly recommend using this seller again.
2,Not something Emily Post would have Written herself,I wasn't that pleased with this book. I was hoping to find something that would inlighten me to how to react in social meeting and dinner parties. Instead it was just chapter after chapter of someone's thoughts and personal stories. I won't even offer this gift as a gift to someone. Just because you are Emily Post's great grandson doesn't mean her talents run in you family.
2,Good but short and not Great,"Covers several items but is somewhat limited.Felt like it was more for a butler than a regular man.However, it did have some good material and I did get good information from reading it."
3,"okay, but not essential","This book is okay. There are a few good pointers in here; if you happen to get a copy it's worth holding onto. Some of the things the author writes about, though (helping around the house, helping with the kids, wedding invitations, etc.), will probably strike most guys as common sense. That said, if you're a 20-something guy who hasn't realized that women don't appreciate it when you stare at their breasts, then this might just be the book for you."
1,"Mediocre read, obvious advice","This might be good for high schoolers or social misfits, but it's certainly not essential, nor does it provide anything the average dolt doesn't already know.My expectation was perhaps a little more refined, and the book provided such evident manners as, don't fart out loud in public. It also wallowed way too much in marriage counseling, a subject the author appears to be familiar with.Post is making money off of his name, but he sure isn't making a name for himself."
4,Must read,I now see clearly that there is still so much I can learn about (international) ettiquette. Using the techniques in this book has helped me make other people feel more respected and build some really good relationships with people from totally different cultural backgrounds.
5,Highly recommended,"Hello there, i'll make this short. I first found the magician's guild series a few years ago and even now i am happy to revisit it. This story allures you into a tale of multiple juicy plots and displays an array of intriguing characters. Though i will admit that it can be cliched at times, it still holds its place as my favourite series and rightly so. If you are looking for a clean, enjoyable read then this is for you! It has an advanced writing style, little to no nasty bits and i recommend it to teenagers and adults alike!"
1,boring!,I love fantasy books but this book really bored me. It lagged and there was rarely any action involved. I was constantly hoping that the next page would be better than the next but it was all the same. I definitely won't read the other books. I wastesd my money!
1,Slower than syrup in January flowing up hill ...,"I'm on page 315 of 365 and have kept reading because I'm stubborn. I also kept thinking, ""something's got to happen."" Unfortunately, it never did. With all the good fantasy out there, please don't make the mistake of starting this trilogy. I was constantly asking myself, ""where is this going?"" Maybe that will be answered in the last 50 pages, but come on, what's up with making me wade through 315 pages with no real goal or direction? Sad, sad, sad. Very mundane, vanilla fantasy. This book adds nothing new, unique or exciting to the genre. If you're looking for good fantasy, read the Fionavor Tapestry trilogy by Guy Gavriel Kay, anything by Salvatore, Illium by Dan Simmons was wonderful and unique (Sci-Fi that reads like fantasy."
2,Average,"By the other reviews I was expecting something fabulous. Unfortunately it didn't turn out to be quite as good as everyone else thought. This book was quite a bit longer than it should have been, as were the rest. I found myself skimming over parts because I would get bored. The characters were predictable. There was nothing that made me truly care about the characters and what happened. The last book in this trilogy was by far the worst. The ending was abrupt and ended in a way that it would make it impossible for me to want to read about the characters in this book again. If you prefer depth and strength in characters I would recommend Elizabeth Haydon, Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, Anne Bishop, and Robin Hobb. If you like easy predictable reads than this is your type of book."
3,Couldn't get in to it,"Light, easy read, but never got attached to the characters or the story ( maybe its just me). I'd give it a try."
2,Boring,The book is long and nothing amazing happened during the book. It was basically dry and continued on and on so I basically skimmed it to finish.
2,Why focus on the city?,"I am always on the lookout for good fantasy and my oldest daughter had bought this book and she liked it, so I started reading it. The first few chapters got me interested, but the plot became quite obvious. I agree with other negative reviews that the main characters are unrealistic and... dull.The fantasy part is too limited, in my opinion. Much effort is spent on describing the city, its classes, economy and geography. But magic hardly seems to help or influence the city or its rules. The same story could have been written in a world without magic, where Sonia had some other special talent.I give it 2 stars, since I was curious enough to finish reading the first part. But even though my daughter has bought the following books, I will not spend time on them."
4,A Good Enjoyable Read,"I have seen this one often in the Sci-Fi section of bookshops. I liked the cover, but thus far had not bought it. However, I am running a little short of novels I want to read and decided the time was right to buy the ebook, which I did.This is an interesting enough story set in yet another fantasy world of magic and guilds. Sonea is a girl from the slums around a city where population purges are carried out by the hated magicians guild. When she throws a rock at the invisible shield that hides the magicians, everyone is shocked when her rock penetrates the barrier and strikes a magician in the head.So she reveals herself as an untrained magician outside the guild and the hunt is on to find her.This book was not especially novel, but it was well executed, and the sequel was set up nicely whilst bringing some closure in the first book. A good enjoyable read."
4,"Ideal for the younger readers, although the old ones can appreciate it too","I read the entire series and one thing came out of it: I myself fell in love with the highlord akkarin. It's just such a romantic story above all.I'm not going to explain what happens in the book but i think this trilogy will mostly appeal to women and girls.The characters are thourough, yet standard. the plotline is entertaining yet predictable. it's one of those let's crawlup by the fireplace and let us dream away for a few hours, without much thinking or remembering.It's a good story but not the best.I would certainly recommend it for young readers (girls) and as light literature."
3,Its ok.,"Only read this series if you have already gone through Mercedes Lackey's works, this is very similar and not as well done as the Valdimar books:The Last Herald-Mage"
2,dull and derivative,"This novel is not particularly well written, and unfortunately, the plot flows along rather obvious paths. The characters are not developed in a meaningful way, and even the protaganist comes off as one dimensional. All in all, skip this one."
4,A nice start,The book starts of good but after a few chapters it becomes a litle bit slow but it picks up rather fast again and after that first bump it's an enjoyable book. It's not a complicated book and the storyline is simple but I have read the whole trilogy and can say it gets a bit more complicatde and bit more shady.I realy enjoyed the book when she got to the guild but that's throu half the book and i guess I was a little bit eager to get there. Those who anticipates the book to get fast to the guild and likes magic maby this isn't the book for you. If you think you can get past the first bump you're in for a good book.
1,"Trite, Derivative, Formulaic, Heavy-Handed.... Skip it.","I agree with many of the other reviewers who've criticized the stilted style, predictable plot, dull characters and bland setting. I picked this one up at the book store on a whim - not knowing anything about the author. That's a few dollars I wish I had back. If you're interested in coming-of-age stories in fantasy settings and are over 13 years old, avoid this book. There's nothing here you can't easily find elsewhere in a better-written and more thought-out package. Ms. Canavan should fire her editor and get someone who can distill her work into something more worthwhile."
3,Not bad,"This work is okay as far as books go. It was well written and easy to follow, but lacked the intense action for which I read these for. She can take a lesson from Brian S. Pratt who wrote The Unsuspecting Mage. There he kept the pace fast and the outcome very uncertain.I enjoyed this book , and look forward to the next one."
2,A Warning to all Adult Readers!,"I got this trilogy this year on the strength of reviews I read here. I guess I am a little dense, and have to have things spelled out to me, so I will say flat-out that this book to geared towards young teenagers. Not adults. I say this as a person who adores Harry Potter and likes the Unfortunate Events series; I am actually a fan of juvenile fiction, but this is not a cross-over series. Just a warning, I'm sure that when I was thirteen, I would have loved these books."
3,"Good pace, but predictable and a tad unrealistic","The book was not bad, but still I would not call it too good either. I found the story to be well-paced and interesting, with a plot that moved constantly --but overall I believe that the writing could have been better.The characters were good, but not great. Sonea and Rothen, in particular, were lovable but I would have liked more depth to them.The ending was very predictable, and to me a bit unrealistic. I felt that the invention of many names for food and drinks (""bol"", ""sumi"" etc.) made the plot seem a bit childish.I can recommend it to readers of light fantasy, but if you're a fan of more darker and epic fantasy, then this is not for you."
2,Weak vanilla story,"I kept waiting for the story to get interesting but nothing happened. Basically keeps the same tempo through out the novel.The storyline is very basic. It is told in a total linear fashion following just one story thread. Trudi poses no serious dilemmas to her characters. Everything is soft balled. For instance, Cerny is faced with having to kill a target for the thieves. At first it seems like a real moral choice. Trudi then immediately paints the target as such a villainous scoundrel that the choice becomes a vanilla trivial one.I felt robbed on so many levels after reading this book."
4,Wonderful Intro. to New Trilogy,Leaves you wanting to read what happends next. Charming and strong main character and supporting characters. Canavan spins a lovely and intriguing world of fantasy with class issues affecting societal relations with each other.
3,Decent Read,"The plot was very very simple thus making it predictable. I also thought the book was longer than is should be. Much of the it centered around catching Sonea. Again predictable. However, it was enteraining. I would not put Trudi on par with Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, Raymond Fiest etc. but she does capture some of the key ingredients for a decent fanstasy novel."
3,Just a long set up for the rest of the series,"This entire novel felt like a VERY long introduction to a series of books, which I am supposed to believe will be more interesting. Not much happened until the end of the story. I couldn't decide if I liked any of the main characters, who all seemed a little morally ambiguous (Are the Thieves good or bad?, Do we like the Magicians Guild or not? Do we like anyone?). The end of the book was fine and followed a common fantasy formula. Clearly not in the same category as David Eddings or Raymond Feist, but an acceptable read."
2,Formulaic and disappointing,"I wish I had gotten this from the library instead of paying money for it. Formulaic, boring, predictable, and downright dumb in the end. There's much better fiction elsewhere."
5,makita 9585cv 5inch variable,This is a great tool. We use it for cutting granite and it works just great it's a good toollast one was used for several years before it giving up the ghost
2,Works great! For a little while.,I do not know if these things are refurbished or what but the brushes on mine needed replaced after 2 months. Kind of ridiculous considering I bought the same Mikita grinder from another place for a little more and it lasted me 4 years without needing a thing. All I really have to say. I have bought two and it happened to both.
4,"Used Makita Grinder in ""very good condition""","As a 30 year veteran finish carpenter, I know a thing or two about tools.As a rule of thumb: good ones are not cheap, and cheap ones are not good.I own several grinders for specific applications, and have found that the Makita brand simply outlasts others. I purchased this 9565CV from rcashwrangler to replace a similar Bosch grinder that I finally wore out. After shopping around a little, I decided that a used tool in ""very good condition"", (for about half the price of new), would be acceptable. For the unaware, UPS standard shipping is a very slow process for any great distance. In all fairness to RCW though, he charged only a modest shipping fee. The grinder itself is in good shape, although is a bit noisier than I'm used to. I have used it now for 3 weeks on a project that requires low speed grinding, and with the exception of the before mentioned issue, it perfoms flawlessly. All in all, a fair deal. I would buy from RCW again."
5,Works where others don't,"This removes frizz where other products I tried didn't at all. My hair still feels sliky the next day, which tells me that moisture is retained. It feels natural and does not have a greasy feel to it. You don't need to use much of it, so don't let the price scare you. It's worth it. I originally found this at CVS, but they don't have it anymore and I can't find any stores that stock it so I have to buy on Amazon. But that's OK because the price is better."
2,The discussion of mourning,I think I expected this book to discuss the concept of mourning and memory more but it also discussed friendship with the inclusion of letters and poems. I cannot say that I disliked this book but its cover lead me to believe it was going to be a different focus.
3,verbatim travel mouse,"Decent mini mouse with programable buttons, but do not buy from restockit.com. They do not stand behind their products."
4,works well,"I find this little mouse works very well overall. My only difficulty is that it does tend to need frequent reprogramming (only a few moments to do; not a big deal). Being so small it is not ergonomically designed, but is quite easy to transport!"
3,REVERSE SENSORS WORKS WELL BUT..,"The reverse sensors works well but the front sensors doesn't work. They don't detect anithing. The mirror has a god size. It would be better if it had a dimmer option because with shine light is difficult to see the image. The Sensor doesn't have a buzzer ( in the photo and the user manual is writting that it has it) i suppose i received a new model because the alarm sound comes from the mirror, then it is not necessary the additional buzzer."
3,After three years,"I have now had this installed in my Truck for three years. The rear reverse sensors works great and is still working. However, the front sensors were not installed since the cable length was too short. The rear cable was too short as well so i installed the box on the back of the rear seats. The clips on the mirror was not strong and the sticky pads useless."
1,JUNK - DO NOT PURCHASE,"I purchased 8 of these barstools for my kitchen and bar. We remodeled our entire house and they were in storage for longer than expected. Four of the eight are completely broken and had to be thrown away. I did not receive a refund due to the length of time we had in storage (several months). We are not large people ( I am 125 pounds), but the post breaks lose and goes right through the base. These should not be sold anywhere."
4,Nice for the price,"Very stylish, easy to assemble, and affordable! I have to agree that they aren't extremely comfortable --something about the backrest height or angle is not ergonomic. And you have to have shoes or slippers on or the footrests are uncomfortable on the soles of your feet. But for the price, they exceeded my expectations and are a welcome replacement for my under-ten-dollars Walmart wooden stools."
4,Good stool and great value!,"Great value and good stool, but make sure you read the ""reviews"" regarding putting this chair together. It has a plastic cap on the pole that holds the seat portion up and if you don't pull that off the chair won't rise to full height. My husband put 2 chairs together, and we had that exact problem. I went on amazon and read the reviews and realized that we had left the cap on ( the directions to put the chair together are the worst, it doesn't even say to remove the cap) once we fixed that the stools rose upOther than that my only problem is that they can tip with younger children climbing up on them at the highest height, but that only happen once and the kids got the hang of it.Overall we love the chairs. They have that modern feel but not over the top contemporary. They add real style to our transitional type decor."
2,negative review,I was told the chairs I ordered over 2 weeks ago were in stock and ready to ship but as of now I have not received them. I have been trying to get the company to give me the status of the order but they would not give me a straight answer until couple of days ago I received an email telling me the chairs will not be shipped for an other 10 to 12 days. My credit card was charged the day I placed the order but should have been charged when the order goes out.Reason for me ordering the chairs in the first place was they were in stock and ready to ship out but that was not sure.
2,non adjustable,"the chairs are good but the lever dosent adjust!! chair went off the maximum length when trying to adjust after assembling it,and now it does not go down,I have to use both the chairs with maximum length."
4,Comfortable,"I ordered this product to replace 2 of my regular wooden, non-swiveling bar stools. This is a lot more comfortable to sit on and is adjustable as described."
5,Love these chairs,"Received these chairs in 2 days with prime shipping, easy to put together and I love how they look. They are very comfortable, I just wish that I would have ordered 2 more."
4,Good deal for the price,Have had for only one month. They look just like the picture. No problems so far.Good deal for the price.
1,think before you buy,Be carefull when buying the chairs had rips in them when I. Recieved them on the back rest. Please beware.When you purchase this item
1,A Total Waste,"I bought two boxes of these. What a waste. The only thing that I captured were my fingers--the glue is still stuck to them as I type this review. The instructions are indecipherable. I stuck the first one to the window backwards. After I washed the glue off the window, I tried again. The second one wouldn't stick to the window when I reversed the procedure and tried to remove the ""protective"" cover. I suppose they are bio-friendly: flies have nothing to fear from these. I give up!"
2,"DULL. Get ""Ilumina"" intead.","This is an expensive software that does not deliver. For a cheaper price and infinite better quality you can get ""Ilumina"" by Tyndale House Publishers."
2,I paid how much for this thing?,"[...] and I get clip art? Computers can run video, high-end audio, and high-rez pictures nowadays! I am very disappointed with this software for [$$$]. It does not live up to the name - Mega. It is simply some Bibles put into eBook-type form and a few bells and whistles. Not much else. If you like to line up 24 different Bible translations - have at it."
3,faster shipping = greater satisfaction,"The book was delivered in its described state, however, the shipping took longer than I thought. I would have liked to have the book sooner because of the time of my class starting."
3,Dry as day old Toast!!!,"This book was required for a Ph.D. course I'm attending at the University of Alabama. Trust me I do not read these books for fun.This book is a set of articles which are all on, you guessed it, the presidency and also the executive branch of the US government.I'm a Poli Sci Ph.D. and I think this is dull, so I would tell everyone to only read this book if you are forced to!"
2,wow ...,"is this ever bad! I suppose some people may get into it, but I am not one of them. First of all the narrator is really, really annoying. Shallow, dramatic (mostly self-created...), whiney, narcissistic,and way too chatty. It's difficult to get beyond a character that you really want to hit up-side the head and say ""shut up, already!"" There a couple of not bad supporting characters, some sloppy sex and drugs, and way too many asides. It's hardly as witty as it claims to be. Proceed with caution.By the way: I left my copy on the Delta shuttle. If you found it, don't hate me."
2,Not so good,"I was very excited about this book, as I adore Alan Cumming beyond all reason. But the book is...not so good. It's not entirely terrible, but it is very disappointing. I'm very glad that I picked it up at a thrift store for a couple of bucks, rather than buying it new.I just don't really care about what happens to the characters - not even our main character/narrator feels even remotely sympathetic, and I just can't bring myself to feel invested in his life. The writing itself isn't too bad - but I also wouldn't call it good. Descriptions and dialogue are often trite or forced, and beyond that the writing is simply unspectacular.But worst of all, despite all the sex and drugs, it's just plain boring. You'd think with all this drama and depravity going on, it would at least be titillating or exciting, but it's just not. I basically had to force myself to finish it, slogging along for nearly 300 pages.I wanted to love this book, really I did, but it just doesn't work."
5,As Described,"These seasonings came just as described - great quality, great taste! I got a lot more pods than I expected for this price."
2,Arrived crushed,"I wish the shipper had used some cushioning on the star anise. It arrived with at least half of the anise smashed. I guess I will have to use cheesecloth to hold some together in recipes. I must admit this is my first time using start anise, so if someone thinks this is not a problem, I would appreciate hearing from them.alleycallie"
5,More than the description bargan,"The description says 3.5oz, but in actuality, I received two, 2oz ounce packs for a total of 4oz. I used them to boil salted peanuts and the aroma was fantastic."
4,"Great Collection, But ...","This is a great collection of awesome 80's music, but I feel that each disc should have had about three more songs on them. Also, I think the title refers to Pat Benatar's HIT ME WITH YOUR BEST SHOT. Strangely enough, the song is nowhere to be found on this set???"
3,I don't understand...,"...Why does this box set not contain the very song its title is a reference to? If it were to be truly complete, it would contain: HIT ME WITH YOUR RHYTHM STICK, by Ian Dury & The Blockheads."
2,"OK for kids, but not for serious use.","Jumps around a lot, no matter what settings are used. No separate OEM drivers, relies solely on MS standard drivers. Resolution is good, but jumpy. Also, the scroll jumps around, too. I'm sorry I bought this. It will work until I get a BlueTrack. Works best when charge cord is always plugged in."
1,I hate this mouse!!,it stops working in the middle of use all the time. you have to keep it pluggud in to a usb port 80% of the time because the rechargable batteries don't hold a charge. this is not what i wanted in a wireless mouse. it stop working 4 times while i was writing this. need i say anymore?
4,Verbatim mouse,I love the mouse but did have to replace the rechargeable batteries with some that held a charge better.
2,verbatim mouse optical wireless mouse,"Unable to make first one function. Amazon replaced it, but I couldn't make the second one function. I do believe the problem is mine, not the product."
2,waste of money,"This is a great concept, too bad the quality isn't there. It only worked for less than a month and I could never reach the company to get it replaced."
3,You get what you pay for....,"The price on this was too good to pass up & that should always clue you in on the quality. The bar actually turned out ok, once the aggravation of putting it together with limited directions was overcome. Some of the parts didn't line up as they should due to holes being drilled a bit off...just enough that it was a fight to force the connecting screws. Once put together, both the bar & the stools are both pretty sturdy. If this was going to be outside all summer I would cover it due to the amount of exposed screws. The screws & bolts did come with covers, the bolt covers stayed on nice enough but the screw covers have popped off everywhere. All in all, for the money, it's not horrible...."
4,Nice looking bar,"Well it does take a bit of time to put this bar together. If you have a set of allen wrenches that fit a power drill - it will make your live 1,000x easier.some of the panel's didn't line up - but I just left those screws out.Bar looks great, the bottom shelf will bow a little if you put a lot of heavy bottles on it.Overall - for the price, this bar looks great."
4,A guilty pleasure,"Yes, this movie is a bit dated and corny, but I remember loving it in my youth (and I still enjoyed it upon my recent viewing). Stars Glenn Ford and Hope Lange were never more attractive in this romantic comedy. The supporting cast features Charles Boyer, Ricardo Montalban, Telly Savalas and a very young John Wood. The story centers around Boyer's *business* of taking poor but titled gentlemen and arranging marriages with heiresses. Montalban is the penniless noble; Lange the airhead heiress. Glenn Ford joins the plot to introduce the two by becoming the family's chauffeur. She fancies race cars; he, it turns out, was a winning race car driver. Naturally, they fall for each other. Filmed on the Riviera, the scenery is spectacular. The plot, as I said, is obvious and old-fashioned. Nevertheless, it's romantic and fun. Enjoy!"
5,A must for any Car Buff,"Silly old rom-com, but a must for any car buff. Set during theMonte Carlo Grand Prix, there are (now) many classic sports andracing cars in the movie, some quite prominently used, like a 60's300 SL Mercedes Cabriolet and 3500 GT Spyder Maserati. The factthat it is finally available after over 40 years, speaks for the longlasting interest in this film."
4,True sound of the jungle,"Icaros are songs that have been given to an apprentice shaman by the spirit of the plant or animal that is the focus of his/her attention and journey. The Icaros on this CD are very well done, and highly recommended for anyone interested in researching traditional use of Yage in a native context. The singers voices ring with the truth and innocence of children, reminding us of who we really are. note: the lyrics are by no means explicit, quite the opposite as they cleanse the enviornment in preparation for sacred work. I found myself singing along, and still hum the very catchy icaros long after hearing them."
3,Nice & simple,"This CD is really simple. It is a clear recording of an authentic Shaman singing, that is it. There are no effects, no background music, no narrator giving a documentary (although that would be cool so heads up you anthropologists out there). It is for a yage ritual and a means of saving what seems to be another dying and doomed culture, yet I am surprised at how often I enjoy listening to this when it is mixed in with other music. It encourages me to find out a little about what is left of the indigenous cultures in the west. That being said, I only give it 3 stars because it gets pretty dull trying to listen to the whole thing. Maybe if I was lucky enough to experience Ayahuasca while listening to it, I would find more interest in it."
2,Not as good as everyone says,"this movie started out quite good with Jiro's family getting killed then his ninja training with lots of ninja jumping around and the such but after that it i my opinion quickly deteriorated personally i found it to get boring quickly after that so what started out to be a promising film in the end, at least for me, was pretty bad"
1,useless,Bought two of the traps. Followed the instructions. Have them for about a month. Nothing is caught in them still have mosquitoes flying around. Will stick to the citronella candles
1,Didn't notice a difference,We put three of these in our little back yard and noticed no difference from last year in the mosquitos. Still a ton... I really wanted this to work :(
1,Disappointing,"This is one biggest disappointment in all the purchases I can recall.I bought two of them. Maybe the lure was old or perhaps it was not for the type of mosquito in the area, but one caught only one mosquito and the other caught none. As a comparison, a regular sticky fly paper caught quite a few mosquitoes."
1,Not a mosquito,"I put this out in my yard around may 28 and haven't caught one mosquito yet. Although they are all over me and my husband (and baby), even to the point we can't go outside for any period of time, none of them have seemed to be able to find this trap. I'm very disappointed."
2,Not good for exercise,"These shorts are not very high quality. The material snags easily, making them look cheap. They stretch out after you wear them for a while and become too loose around the legs, which can expose a little too much skin. Also, when you roll the waistband down (which is how they're meant to be worn), they often ride up which is highly irritating when you're jogging or simply walking. I do not recommend these to anyone."
3,Blue Mesh,"These shorts are alright. They aren't exactly what I was looking for. They're definitely not as heavy of a material as I was hoping for, but I guess good for knock around shorts. I wouldn't buy them for anything sturdy. They definitely don't fit too flattering."
1,it stunk!,"i got this board for christmas and i put it together and i was so happy that i had finally gotten it that i was jumping up and down but when i was jumping i landed on it and it snapped into 3 peices. i was really upset because that was my only christmas present that i had gotten that year, i called the company and they said to return it so i did, they gave me another one back again which took 11 months!!!!! and i tested it out and it was fine so i went and tried a kickflip and i snapped the tail when i was going pretty fast so i fell down hard and when i fell down my board rolled out in the street and it got ran over by a car and popped and and hit the car and made a $900 dent in it that i had to pay with my two years of allowence.i was upset but luckily the company gave me $1100 back from of all of what happened so now things are back to normal and i have a baker"
2,naomi campbell,I'm going to be up front about thisthis magazine is not worth your moneyThe only good part about is naomi campbellso just keep your money
3,beautiful but beware,"This book is full of beautiful gloves and mittens but beware of mistakes. There are errors in materials needed-amount of yarn. Errors in number of stitches to cast on and mistakes in the knitting charts. If you are an experienced knitter you will be able to find the problems, beginners will have a problem."
2,underwhelmed by Ron Clark Story,"I saw Ron Clark on Oprah's favorite teachers show. He was dynamic and innovative and so I ordered his ""story."" I found it to be a trite and hackneyed version of the typical teacher in the ghetto. Meryl Streep did a much better job in ""Music of the Heart."" James Edward Olmos in ""Stand and Deliver"" was far superior, as was Richard Dreyfus in Mr. Holland's Opus."" This video was a waste of my money and time."
3,A solid B- inspiration teacher film.,"Matthew Perry gets a drama role, and he's in rare form. You would think he'd try drama more, as his comedy roles have run the post-""Friends"" gamut from moderate to painful.Of course, eventually we'll run out of true stories about white people who decide to teach inner city schools, are originally in over their heads, then finally triumph over adversity."
3,Hollywood must've hokeyed it up!,"I've seen all the famous teacher movies, so I had a little trouble believing this was a true story. All the cliches were there: loses his temper like Thackery in To Sir With Love, ruins his health like in Stand and Deliver, colleagues are burnt out - like every teacher movie. As a teacher for 20 years in the inner city, I can tell you it was terribly simplified. I haven't read his book - it's got to be better than the movie.Okay, I have to admit I don't like Matthew Perry, so that did color my view too."
5,Amazon not able to Supply DVD,"Evidently, Amazon does not want people to know this is available from the Ron Clark Academy. This is a wonderfully inspiring movie. I've enjoyed it every time I've watched it. Since there are many great reviews, I would like to point out something else which may help some others who are looking to get the DVD. I've been waiting for Amazon to fulfill my order since April. It was in stock when I ordered it, but they can't seem to supply it. [...]"
4,Great movie!,"Perry is moving and the story is too. An OUTSTANDING TV movie. I RARELY give 5 stars, but this was a close one!"
5,Excellent movie!,"I highly recommend ""The Ron Clark Story""---it's truly inspirational. I use it in the classroom after teaching ""To Sir With Love""---both show teachers with determination and patience to reach students that many feel are unreachable.I think Matthew Perry was an excellent choice to portray Ron Clark. Overall, excellent movie! My students really enjoyed this movie!"
4,Excellent,"I ADORE Matthew Perry and have always liked his character in ""Friends"". I won't say more but wow, he did a great job portraying Ron Clark. I am a real sucker for teaching/education movies, and this one definitely is a must-see. I think everybody should watch this and would make a good present for that special teacher in your life. I also highly recommend ""The First Grader"" as well, another must-see."
5,The Ron Clark Story,"This is an excellent movie! I recommend this movie to all teachers. Anyone needing inspiration when the day to day grind of teaching wears you out needs to see this movie! If I ever teach education classes on the college level, this will be a required assignment in my class."
4,Ron Clark Story,Great inspirational true story. A remarkable man who went above and beyond to reach & inspire his students. A must watch for teachers prior to starting the new school year.
4,Euro Hinge Cutter,"The kit contains a 35mm bit and a drilling guide. The bit is sharp and a protective shield is provided when not in use. The drilling guide puts the hole right on the money, however the screw holes were off a little bit with my hinges, but no big deal. After drilling the holes, insert the hinge and mark the screwholes. Works great. I like the euro hinge and with equipment like this, they are a piece of cake to install."
1,This Bit is in really bad condition!!!!!!!!,"My God this is the first bad experience i had with purchasing an item from Amazon.The 35mm bit is in really bad condition, its rusty and the plastic cover as advertise is missing...... too me, this looks like really old stock (35mm bit).I really wish i had received what was advertised, a new bit with template and plastic cover for the bit.35mm Bit with Marking Template"
4,Mad about Medimix,"I like this soap. I don't have any skin conditions to begin with, but I like the fragrance and the fact that it's cruelty free. It's like Chandrika with more potent fragrance and medicinal herbs.You should try it if you like natural soaps."
5,AMAZING!,"This bar soap was recommended to me by my facialist. I absolutely LOVE it. The smell is a bit strong, but you get used to it after a while... would definitely recommend to others!"
3,A regular journal,"I was very disappointed after experiences w/other journals writen by ME to find this was really a blank journal with a few scattered thoughts. It is spiral bound and easy to use, but I had expected more from her. If you merely want a place to write this will be more than adequate, but I expected thought provoking questions and the like."
5,Inquire Within,"I have a granddaughter who is Down. She absolutely loves the pictures in this book. We are teaching her to just love books, and she is four now, so I look for books at this time with wonderful pictures of things she can find outside in the world. Trista and I enjoy this book very much."
2,Hard to take up!,"I found it difficult going, reading this book, due to its redundancy (she says the same thing in different ways more than once in most paragraphs it seems) and its plethora of details rather than getting on with the plot and the characterization. The characters have hackneyed thoughts and feelings and little dialogue. It is billed as 'another Alex Jensen mystery' but the secondary character, Jesse, is predominant. This is my first Henry mystery. Maybe I am missing something that happened in the previous books. I was bored. And felt irritated and patronized."
3,"Okay, but not the best",This was not one of her better books. I liked the ones with the sled dogs better. Even though this was not her best Henry described the Alaska wilderness vividly.
5,GREAT book with VERY unusual ending!,"Anyone who likes mysteries with a twist will go nuts over this one! I sent it to my daughter with a note on the last page to call me when she finished it. I thought maybe I wasn't reading it right, but she agreed with me. I won't say more, I don't want to spoil it for others. A must read! Sue Henry needs to get busy and write faster! Like a trip to Alaska, plus a super story!"
5,Stick to the basics... Type Basics,"Adobe Type Basics has been a lifesaver. About a year ago, my business partner and I launched a weekly newspaper. We knew our way around Adobe Photoshop, QuarkXpress and Adobe PageMaker, so we figured we were ready. Boy, were we wrong. We soon discovered we ""didn't know jack"" about fonts. We experienced reflow problems, missing fonts and other foul-ups, and our printer terrified us with even worse horror stories about what can happen when good type goes bad. Thankfully, a graphic designer tipped us to Adobe Type Basics. The CD (for Windows or Mac) contains 65 of Adobe's most popular typefaces, including test, display, script and symbol styles. It's a generous variety, without being overwhelming. An unexpected bonus was the inclusion of the Adobe Type Manager software to help organize our fonts. Adobe Type Basics is a great value."
1,Misleading information that can cause more damage than good.,"I would prefer a no star review. This is the first book I""ve picked up that warns of the ""dangers of masturbation"". So, I guess since she advises against sex before marriage also that one just needs to wear a chastity belt throughout his developing years, not watch tv, look at magazines, listen to music, look at others (one might become aroused and then what?). This book takes us back about a century."
3,"Stellar conducting, stunning rep, rough performance","It is great to see these rare gems unearthed. However, the chorus is very poorly balanced, with the women ever overpowering the men. There is little blend in the women's sections. Nonetheless, Parkman draws forth an emotional delivery. If you can withstand the blasting sopranos, this is a wonderful collection of rarely performed works. The music is dark purple, intensely conveying the meaning of the texts."
5,Perfect for AP Biology,"We also used this text for Biology from grade 10 through to grade 12 AP, and it's definately the best."
1,Not Worth the Money,"There is a great reason why this remote is offered with two remote switches. They die at different rates.The first one died about two months after installation and the second one died yesterday, 1/4/11. The store I purchased it from was kind enough to replace it for me so I made the 20 mile drive. The replacement lasted about 1 minute, working intermittently. When I checked the control unit, the dust collector started working as I inspected. The plug wasn't tight at all and smelled like burning plastic.The store again replaced this unit and the last one seems to be working properly. While I am not in the shop I will unplug it and when it dies I will look for another manufacturer. Shop Fox should be ashamed of themselves for offering such a second rate product."
4,Works as advertised for me,"I bought one of these about 4 years ago and it has worked flawlessly for me during that time. It has worked thru a couple of walls from forty feet away. I don't remember the last time (or, if ever, I changed the battery in one of the remotes.However, I recently had one of the remotes fail because the micro-switch inside failed (I dismantled it and determined this). Too bad the remote is not available as a separate item or I would replace it. Of course it's cheap enough that I might just buy another for the remotes."
1,shop fox dust collector remote,Wanted a 110 volt unit and was sent 220 volt. Sent to wrong address despite my attempts to get it redirected.Not very happy about the service.
2,Delicate and unreliable,"When I received mine, one of the remotes didn't operate at all. As I was busy with projects I didn't bother to make the return. About 6 months later, I dropped the remaining one and its toast. OK, I dropped it but you would think that is the kind of thing that happens a lot. I'm writing this review only because the ShopFox one came up first during my search."
1,"Shop Fox, D3038",Within a year I have burned up two main units. I am a hobbiest woodworker and cannot recommend this product.
1,Seek an alternative or an improvement.,"I purchased these at a local store, thinking, what a great idea!Within an hour of placing them, they popped open and will not stay closed with their own self adhesive. They are very sticky to handle, similar to the White fly traps, but not enough to keep the cardboard closed.This is a great idea, however, the manufacturer needs to devise a better way to keep these closed. The instructions say to put them near base-boards to be most affective...Do Not put these where your pets or children can get to them!"
4,name makes no sense but good movie,"I liked the movie and the lessons. Harsh in places but definately recommend it. Don't worship God, worship anything stalin. Sad sad sad,Great acting!"
2,dismal and oppressive,"A most troubling film. It graphically depicts the inhuman sadism and brutality of a Stalinist-era holding center for war orphans, which is really a horrifying prison camp. It has some stylish photography, with artistic shots of clouds and sky, but generally it is shot in subdued earth tones which are as barren and bleak as the childrens' lives.Into the midst of this distressing and frightening environment comes a beautiful young boy named Isaak. He is strangely serence, and provides the few moments of peace in this grim film, but even his presence cannot dissipate its stark inhumanity.If you like unrelenting futility and hopelessness, then this is the film for you."
1,Not the same item as pictured,What was recieved is NOT the same item as in the picture. It does not include the white tubes going through the trap to hold the protein. It is the yellowish colored trap with the black top and just two little holes on the side. This trap does not work nearly as well. Would not recommend this.
1,design change? bummer,"I have had years of wildly successful experience with the original design pictured in this Amazon ad, yet I find the customer feedback clearly indicates that the current design does not match the photos, and worse, does not perform nearly as well as the pictured design with which we have all had success. OakStump - are you listening? I have tried many different trap configurations, and the original design pictured was hands-down the best. With the original design, we could catch 200 Yellowjackets a day and completely wipe out a nest in a matter of a few days. I will build my own copy of the original design and be done with it. Too bad."
1,Fell Apart,"Looks nice, goes on as most bands, can be cut to size and feels comfortable. But after a week the safety clasp fell off when the watch was on my wrist. Lost it somewhere."
3,"very nice, but....","Band looks great on watch, good construction, every thing you could ask for, except it seems short. Never had this happen with any rubber band before, but I got what looks like a chemical burn on my wrist where the rubber touched. Maybe it was an allergic reaction."
4,Comfortable and dusty.,This is a very light and comfortable rubber strap. No complaints other than it gets a bit dusty. But I usually just wash it off with water and then it looks good. For the price Id say its worth it.
5,"Very good for the money. Lacks a bit in the packaging, but otherwise great","This was easy to use and adjust. You need a fine tool of sorts to undo the spring pins that hold it in place, but otherwise awesome. The rubber is very easy to cut to size. I like the clasp too because it has two buttons that you push to release. Pretty neat and better than a tag heuer i have."
4,"Nice band, but a little soft, questionable longevity.","Nice band, make sure your measure and mark it properly before cutting and fitting it to you. The compound is really soft and ""gooey?"" so I'm not sure how long it will last, but overall the quality seems excellent. Fast shipping and honest seller."
5,SUBTLE / BRILLIANT / AWESOME,"Well I gush, so shoot me. All reviews are correct. Great BLUES, great songs, intelligent lyrics, great musos, originality and a wicked sense of humour. If you like the BLUES, you are missing out, if this isn't in your collection. After receiving this CD, my wife and I danced around the living room for close to an hour, one of the highest compliments we can pay to any CD."
5,The Girl in the Fall-Away Dress,"I thought this would be just another lame, overly sensitive chick book that my wife brought home. The cover shot is a nice way to get a semi-literate husband to pick it up and thumb through it, and that is exactly what I had intended to do. However, I found myself reading the whole damn thing start to finish. The soulfulness of the characters, the crisp descriptions and Richmond's ability to tug at one's emotions left me wanting more. Who the hell is this Ivan guy?"
3,First book - not the greatest,"I have read Michelle Richmond's books, all of which I loved! So, I was dying to read this one.I believe it was her first book - a compilaiton of short stories that were somehow suppose to come together - that's what I read somewhere.I was sort of disappointed in that the book seemed like a lot of stories that somehow weren't complete and really didn't connect - other than I think they were about a family of girls and their individual stories.It was a little hard for me to follow because it jumped from one girl to the other.I didn't NOT like it, but, it didn't really move me as all her other books have.I like the way she has ""matured"" in her story writing and am looking forward to her next novel, which I hope is coming soon."
2,Jessica Simpson,What happened to the other favors I wanted the coconut body butter I do not like the sweet butter one as much I was wondering how do I get the other flavors the coconut one was the best one :)
5,Why would you buy anything else?,"Makita brand has yet to do me wrong. Have only done a few small jobs with this new 4.5"" grinder. I have used similar grinders in the 1980s and 1990s. On some jobs we would run the grinders 8 hours a day 5 days per week. Very reliable. Until a Makita chokes the chicken prematurely, I will never look to another brand for power tools."
2,this is the Dreamcatcher of it's time,"alien scum beware, Donald Sutherland (The Italian Job2003) is on your ass with a team of agents as well including Eric Thal (no clue what he played in). you also got Thal's military friend played by Keith David (Hollywood Homicide) and a crazy scientist played by Will Patton (Fled). This one makes your skin crawl with he eery sound the aliens make, though it lacks in areas and the scene where Thal is in the shower and he bawls his eys out was hilarious. we didnt have to see his ass. it just never ends does it. hey, at least the aliens didnt crawl up in your orfice like in Dreamcatcher which was better"
1,Katydid Strokefever: The Girl Asked About the Mushrooms and Shouldered the Animosity of the Systemgreen,"Feeble entry to the genre....lugubrious, unintriguing pace...the sexual undertones were a colossal blunder...I feel the story would have improved if the appropriate sense of urgency was instilled...such a melodramatic title calls for putting the reader in a headlock...no, sir, this wasn't a good one AT ALL."
2,Not worth it,"I thought this would be neat to look over what CA has to offer dogs, but it's too general and the number of things listed in Southern CA where I live are too limited. I find I can get much better results by just doing research on sites like Yelp! or the like. Many of the best dog related activities are not even in here and I would only find this useful if I found myself in only god knows where territory, didn't have a cell phone signal, and for some reason remembered to pack this book with me. I'd only recommend if you don't mind the risk of wasting your money to see what's included in this book."
5,thank you,"I thank the author for helping my daughter, myself, and Alvin our Papillion mix to have a wonderful Christmas vacation in the greater LA area due to the detailed information on dog friendly activities."
3,I'm sure it used to be great.,Swell book but WAY out of date. This is the 5th printing but I've been unable to verify that there is any new information since 1993. We used it on a trip last week and most of the places we checked out had changed their policy or had gone out of business.
3,good book - lots of material - would make a better website.,I found the book to be a little thin - considering how thick it is - on material.Maybe it's the nature of things but I think it should include kennels in the area that youre traveling to as well. sometimes it's not always possible to have your dog *everywhere* you go (snowboarding for instance) but to be able to kennel them at a preffered location would be handy. I spend hours looking up this information online from various sources as is.
5,Really helpful,This is a great book if you are traveling in California with a dog. Has a lot of the dog parks listed. I appreciate the fact that each town that has something in it has a listings and there is a rating system through out the book so I can tell at a glance what we can do and what the author thought of it. There is also great advice on fun places to go with dogs. My Husband and I grab it and our dog on the weekend and go out and adventure with it. Highly recommend it.
3,California Dog Friendly Guide,"It is very nice to have some inside information on good places to take your dog. This book was helpful BUT it represented itself as being up to date and it was not. It had out of date information as well as missing information that really should have been included. I had the same problem, though to s lesser degree, with the Oregon version of the book. Despite that drawback, I did have several lovely outings with my dog and did find some nice places to stay in California and Oregon."
