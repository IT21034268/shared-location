1,Wat too abstract for this man's tastes,"Based on the reviews this would be a funny movie that involved some degree of cannibalism. However, it turns out that the premise the topic could provide some dark humor was wrong. Any probability for humor was obscured in the movie itself. This resulted from the fact the movie tried too hard to be smart and cutting edge. It failed with the result something I just could not even watch for more than a few minutes. Yellow light bathing everything, no thank you. Meat colored walls, again no thanks. Plain boring story and too ambitious a concept, not interested. I would argue that it is too abstract to enjoy unless one is has that high an opinion of themselves. However, that might just be me."
3,ok,"I saw this because Mick Jagger professed admiration for it in an interview. When I watched the first half-hour of DELICATESSEN, I was blown away by how smart and quick it was. But then it slowed up, and it stayed at the slower pace. I still enjoyed the rest of the movie--it's a movie Terry Gilliam would make if he had talent--but regretted that the whole of the film wasn't as brilliant as the first part."
5,terrific blu ray transfer,a classic from jeunet - beware of the dark humour - and a stellar transfer for the picture and sonic universe of jeunet
4,Is mother coming for dinner? She is dinner.,"Beyond the madness is a sweet little love story. A bleak meatless society has turned to cannabalism. It's funny. Really. The butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) hires a former clown, Louison (Dominque Pinon) as a handyman, for rent above his shop. He sizes him up as his next victim, even though he is a bit lean. All the other boarders who are truly a bizzare group seem to know this & are waiting for their next meal. But Julie, the butcher's daughter & Louison fall in love as she plots to thwart her father's plan. It's a totally absurd, French, black comedy. Each boarder has strange kinks. Especially note the poor lady who consistently fails in imaginative ways to kill herself. You almost root for her to succeed."
5,Don't like sub-titles?,"Don't let that put you off. The visual mastery of this film more than makes up for the sub-titles. A circus clown, a mad butcher his mistress and his alluring daughter, a swamp man, an authoritarian postal worker, a hapless grandmother, a suicidal wife and her husband, along with a pair of toy ""moo"" makers make up the characters for this film. There is also plenty of comedy in the form of slapstick and strange situations. The spoken dialog hardly matters at all with this visual smorgasbord going on."
5,Charmingly bizarre and bizarrely charming!,The most darkly original comedy I've seen - a real delight
3,Not so much,"I'm a fan of this director's later work but this one just didn't do anything for me.It's not common that I find something that's too weird for me, but this kinda was..I just didn't get it.It was well shot and acted, but I felt the story fell flat."
2,GA-GA a la French,"This work is a perfect example of brilliant cinematographic/acting techniques serving paranoiac ideas a script presents.A well facilities-supplied single section of a demolished building populated with meal-eating cannibals sitting on the wheat consumed by the other gang of sewage-residing outcasts.It is hard to comprehend this perverted story of sadistically awaiting themselves to be eaten, climaxed in a stupid ending.No wonder crime is on rise round a ""civilized"" world."
3,It okay,"It was entertaining, but it show negative furture where they can only see apperant solution to their lot in life"
4,sent quick,I love this novel its slightly dated but gives great insight into the mind set of the time. Not much happens but if you like your novels cerebral with the odd cup of tea you will love this under rated author.
5,woodstock chimes of venus,waited to do a review. has really held up in the weather. so beautiful to hear. my neighbors love it as well. can't go wrong with the quality and price.
1,disappointment,"Sorry, the heroine is sad, the hero is sad, the mother-in-law is sad, and the daughter is sad! This is romance? The relationship between Emily and Luke is boring and the story line slow moving. It all comes together in the end, but I really didn't care anyway. The Irish Bride had some interesting drama at least, although the love between Ms. Harrington's characters leaves me wanting something...more!"
1,"Very disappointing, very little plot","The plot was very weak and this book was a waste of time. The author has the characters repeat the same thoughts over and over and over. As if the author needed to fill pages, she just repeated the same *conflict*. Did I mention there is only one conflict in the entire book?"
2,Warning! Wrong Aspect Ratio!,"I was excited to see ""Sheena"" once again presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Although the box clearly states ""Sheena"" is anamorphic widescreen, the disc is pan and scan. When will Sony stop this insanity? Will they issue a new, corrected version? By the way, the two stars in this review apply only to Phoebe Cates."
1,Yuck!,"How can such an AMAZING song come from such an AWFUL album?! Standing... is among my favorite songs of all time, and Skin Turns Blue is really good too, but the rest of the CD is pitiful. This is among the worst CDs I've ever bought!"
2,Get the single.,"Got it for X-mas. I asked for it 'cause of song #3. If you like this song, the rest of the album is absolutely nothing like it!"
4,BB King,"Yah, that ""old man"" is BB King. Can't remember the song name, but it's a clip taken from one of his songs. Overall I love the mix though. *grin*"
1,Let's hear it for the one-hit wonders...,"The ""Broken Phonebooth"" song is a delight with a lot of cool poetic lyrics. The rest of the album is awful and my copy of it (bought because hearing the song (in pieces) on the radio was driving me delightfully crazy) is stuck deep in a box within a box: never to see the light of day again."
2,i gotta go with the nay-sayers.,"I was curious to see if anyone writes bad reviews for albums on this site. Since everyone wants to write about the albums they love, every CD here is getting great reviews. I checked on this album becuase I felt it really sucked, and was curious to see what kind of things people wrote. I see that some people liked it, which is cool. I've heard this guy is well-respected for his dedication to his music. Well, good luck to him if that 's what he wants to do. Just wasn't my thing."
3,"Man...you can buy this album for a PENNY, man...","This album came along at that point in my life when I started ditching the music my parents liked (which is how most of us initialize our musical tastes, of course) and began following more modern artists. The single ""Standing Outside a Yada Yada Yada,"" with its looped, moanin' BB King and its rain-soaked drum machine grabbed my burgeoning teen angst by the bollocks and gave 'em a good yank.I was addicted to this album for months, and was amazed that there had been music like this floating around outside my peripheral this whole time, unbeknownst to me. This album inevitably led me to harder stuff, like Nine Inch Nails and Soundgarden, and soon I recognized Primitive Radio Gods for what it was: a mediocre band.But man, I'll always love this album, even if it's for nostalgic reasons only. I can't give it five stars, because Lord it just ain't that good, but for one solitary red cent, I'm tempted to get back that copy I sold so many years ago."
2,prepare for impact...,"When I bought this album, I bought it used, so I got it really cheap which helped with my dissapointment when I listend to it and found out that ""Standing outside a broken phone booth..."" and ""Are you happy"" are the only two good songs on it. If you were planning on buying this album because of the hit ""Standing outside a broken phone booth..."" then do yourself a favor and get PRG's follow up album ""White Hot Peach."" ""Rocket"" pales in comparison to ""White Hot Peach,"" but this album is almost worth its money for the broken phone booth song alone. In conclusion, if you are going to buy this album, don't expect much more than 11 minutes of good music, because this album just isn't very inspired, and is just plain bad. I loved their second album, so do yourself a favor and get that one instead."
3,Different and interesting,"This book is a wicked satire, showing a future in which the politically correct have triumphed, to the point where Olympic medals are degraded because they reward ability. People can escape punishments with ""victim points,"" showing they have been oppressed by the majority. Etc. Walker wraps this up in Norse mythology and adds religious overtones. It is hard to agree with all of his points, but there are so few satires done from a conservative point of view that this one is refreshing."
1,You can get better footage for free on youtube,"A 35 minutes video that cost 30 dollars. Stay away from this one, it is a rip off. Paul Hamilton is a trike instructor, he has nothing to do with PPCs. This video accomplishes nothing about teaching you about PPC. In simple words this is footage of PPCs flying. You can get that for free from you tube or online. Save your hard earned money and buy a book on PPCs. You have been warned!"
3,The Scenery of Low Level Flying,"Okay DVD, but would have enjoyed more on takeoffs and Landings.Scenery was great, but needed more detail to flight technology."
5,relaxing,This is a replacement for my previous copy. This is a wonderful music to play at bedtime for relaxing and meditating.
2,VERY poor Quality!,"This is some of the most beautiful, restful, and wonderful music to meditate to. That said, the quality of this recording was worse than my 45 year old 45rpm records. for the first 8 minutes, breaks in the music, (Short Gaps) destroyed your ability to relax. Finally after numerous gaps the remaining part is clear. By then, you are just anticipating the next gap and it was a truly bad expirence."
4,Camping made easy,This book was extremely helpful to campers of all levels. I have been camping for quite some time and still learned a lot of tips on how to make your trip as enjoyable and environmentaly friendly as possible. Anyone considering a day hike or longer should read this first.
5,"This is Audrey's 1991 LP ""Rendezvous""",Its an excellent album and Audrey's songs are wonderful. But shameful lazy production on album artwork...that's JUDY LANDERS not Audrey!
5,Best if you've seen the play.,"This, not-as-spicy-as-the-new-version-Evita, recording is a classic. It doesn't have the modern sound that the remake with Madonna has, but it is what was originally intended by Andrew Lloyd Webber. If you have seen the play, you will love this version. Patti Lupone does a great job, as does Mandy Patinkin. No dialog to bog down with, just pure listening enjoyment. --Like most though, best if you've seen the play."
2,Can Someone Answer me on this?,"I see that Colm Wilkonsen is credited for playing Che. I sold my copy of this concept recording but I could swear mine had David Essex listed in it and his picture as well for Che. Is this possible. This Was NOT the londan cast recording (with Elaine Paige) that i had, it was the concept album with Julie."
1,Not that good,"Julie has a really sweet and nice voice but it just isn't strong enought to portray Evita. Except for Colm Wilkinson, the rest of the cast and the orchestra playing the background music stinks."
2,Extraordinarily Boring...,"As an actor myself, I find this score one of the most remarkably boring ever created by Andrew Lloyd Webber - making it one of the most boring theatre scores I've ever heard. I suppose it did little for me after listening to the studio cast recording of ""A Little Night Music"" (Sondheim), but it nonetheless inspired little excitement. The monotonous repetion of ""ideas"" and melodic lines do nothing to build upon a thematic concept, which rests entirely in the hands of one woman. Though she obviously struggles with subtlety in dialogue and music, Patti LuPone remains one of the gutsiest, gruntiest Eva's out there (buy the original Broadway recording). LuPone appeared in the professional production in Melbourne, Australia at Her Majesty's Theatre as part of the original tour.Dated, boring and weak - nearly as musically challenging as ""Phantom of the Opera""."
1,BAD!! BAD!! BAD!!,The singers talk their way through this horrible cd. There is no singing! The orchestra also needs better musicians and the songs sound practically the same. Whoever wanted to dub Julie Covington's voice over Madonna's obviously doesn't like good singing.
1,Mediocre Performance,"Julie Covington has a really high pitched, emotionless, and very un sing songy voice. The singer who portrays Che has an annoying nasal twang. Evita is great. This performance is not."
1,Stale and boring,In contrast to the music fan from USA I thin this musical sounds over-rehearsed and stale. The singers sing without gusto and I think that is because of too many run throughs. The singing lacks operatic qualitites and is altogether thin.
2,Insecticide?,"This CD changes the lyrics of many songs with insecticide. The Lady's got potential is completly messed up. this CD is a confusing wast of time. Some of the singers are OK, but some, well, aren't."
4,Evita can't hit the high notes but Che is good,"That's Colm Wilkinson, the lead in ""Les Mis"" singing Che. There's more in common between the orchestrations & lyrics in the movie soundtrack and THIS, compared to the Broadway cast cd, which has a MUCH better Eva (Patti Lupone). Still, this one has the rockin' ""The Lady's Got Potential."" This cd is the very first recording of the musical, and Webber & Rice had time to work on it before the West End & Broadway..."
4,Julie Covington Is The Best Evita,"Julie Covington is the one and only, definitive Evita. No one else comes close to her brilliant vocal performance. Alas, the rest of the album has dated rather terribly, and many of the later updated lyrics are superior. What were they thinking with that insecticide stuff? If only there was a way to dub Julie Covington's voice over Madonna's non-performance!"
5,A Great Read,"Hard-Boiled Men was a wonderful read. I could not stop laughing throughout the entire read. Jacobs did a great job is depicting single life in NYC. This is a must read for anyone who has ever gone through a breakup. Most importantly, this book will make you think long after you finish reading it."
2,Where's the Cheese Shop sketch?,"I recall that years ago I enjoyed the benefit concert on TV. I bought the tape mainly to get the Cheese Shop sketch. While there are several hilarious Monty Python sketches as well as an early Rowan (aka Black Adder) Atkinson, I was disappointed. The overall the audio/video quality is awful, most of the other skits are crude and profane (and not shown in the U.S. televised version), and most importantly - THE CHEESE SHOP SKETCH IS NOT ON THIS TAPE. The Amazon editorial review is simply wrong."
3,Disappointing,"If this film footage had the same music as the original album, it would be worth $100, but it doesn't even come close. I bought the album, on its first release when it came out. The Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton collaboration is worth more then the rest of the whole show, if it were the same as on the LP. But it's not, I know, somewhere out there, someone has this footage on film. If they had any respect for great filmed music, they would re-release it, the entire show and give the proceeds to Amnesty International. It would definitely make a bundle, including some from me. And, by the way, the copies of this VHS I have are the MGM/UA originals and they only have 1 out of the 3 songs that Beck and Clapton played together."
1,Something Completely Different from the Original,"This edited version of the original (out-of-print) Secret Policeman's Other Ball is disappointing. Some of the choicest bits (including Pete Townshend's incredible acoustic of ""Pinball Wizard"") have been omitted.There are still some good sketches (""Cha-cha-cha"")and music (Sting, Phil Collins, Jeff Beck, Clapton), but overall it was a very disappointing experience. If you want to support Amnesty International, send them a check. If you want to see The Secret Policeman's Other Ball, find a rental or buy a used copy of the original."
2,Lots Missing from original show,"I was at first thrilled to see that this was available. But wait--there's less! Apparently from what I can gather, the complete original show seen in the early 1980's or so has never been made available in VHS or DVD form. So don't get your hopes up. This ""edition"" is missing LOTS of the original footage. I can only imagine that some of the performers must not have signed releases for portions, or something. What I recalled as one of the funniest shows I'd ever seen was reduced to eliciting an occasional chuckle. Still some good stuff, but overall Not Recommended."
4,"Edie is young, but don't let that fool you...","Edie Carey's second CD is an amazing follow up to her debut album. she continues to profoundly express herself through her music. She is one of the best up-and-coming folk musicians, i encourage any folk fan to check out her music.If you have a chance, see Edie play live. She has an amazing stage presence (along with being VERY funny). it will really change the way you listen to her music."
3,Not the best game,"I bought this for my 4 yr old boy who is way into lizards, but he has no desire to play it. It is kind of slow moving and you do same thing over and over again. We have enjoyed other games much more."
3,"After you figure it out, it's pretty fun","We had to go over the directions quite carefully at first to figure out how to play, but once we got it figured out, it's pretty fun. You have several two sided tiles that you put in a shaker (like Yahtzee) and roll them. These tiles have one of 4 pictures of bugs on each side. You also have 4 cards in front of you which match the 4 types of bugs. Each roll, you turn one of your cards face up at random. However many of the tiles match the bug on your card, you move that many spaces. The twist is that one of the tiles has a smiley face on one side and a sad face on the other side. Depending which face is rolled each time, it means ""smiley"" for the person in last place, or ""sad"" for the person in the lead. You either get an extra turn if you are in the rear or have to move backwards if you are in the lead. So this game can take a few minutes depending on if you roll the ""smiley"" each time or 15 minutes if you roll the ""sad face"" alot."
3,"Good acting, dull plot...","The review on the site, and cover gave it a little more thrill than it was, but acceptable."
3,Amateurish,Sorry I must disagree with others here & I'm sure that probably those reading what I write here will give a negative response but I don't care - The plot is inane & the boy who is the lead actor needs acting & diction lessons. He doesn't know how to speak properly - or was he coached to do that? I'm glad others enjoyed the movie but I didn't & wasn't interested enough to sit through all of it. Watching a kid who didn't seem to have much talent acting & spoke like most teens speak - monotones & mumbling - didn't interest me. There are better things to do & better movies to watch.
4,Hard to put down,"Leo Mazzone writes of his 11 years as a pitching coach for the Atlanta Braves. A period during which the Braves won many divisional championships and Mazzone's staff routinely posted the leagues lowest ERA while winning 6 Cy Young awards. Mazzone book takes us inside this legendary pitching staff while he works with such future Hall of Famers such as Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltze. I found this book full of insights and hard to put down. I would ordinarily give it 5 stars but took off 1 star. Because Mazzone in a very petty move pilloried a pitcher, by including the man's name, who pitched only 1 inning in the show and who gave up several runs. Otherwise a very worthwhile book."
4,Mazzone's Book,"Pretty good for a sports & baseball book. Especially this guy, who was a guru - just look at the record. Several years ago, he was asked and developed a work-out routine for the Potomac State College pitching staff, of which the Pot State Coach gave us a copy at our January Baseball Clinic. I'm not a paid coach, but have heard a lot of coaches talk about pitching, read lot of books, and coached say junior high boys for several years, and this routine was impressive. Think may still have it, but would have to hunt for a while. Believe it gave a day by day routine, e.g. starting throwing say 1/3 then 1/2, then say 3/4 distance and also increasing the time and worked on certain pitches. Believe their was a routine for everything, and their was a fair amount of practice pitching. The whole deal was very impressive to us all. He covers this methodology somewhat in his book. Not a Braves fan but you had to admire their pitching staff and this guy."
5,What We Owe to Each Other,"It is an excellent book concerning moral norms and specifically emphasizes Scanlon's contractualist view. Scanlon seems to make 'justification' the core basis of ethics. But his contractualist view has several contoversial issues, as in the case of Gauthier's contractarian view. But, without doubt, this an important book by a first-rate scholar."
1,Blah....,"I found Scanlon to be quite wordy. He could have said what he wanted to say in half the space. The major frustration with the book is that while Scanlon presents his theory of contractualism, he does not answer the objections to it. For example, in Chapter 8 (relativism), he discusses the objection to his theory but never directly answers it. After you've read 300+ pages, it would be nice if he could defend his own theory."
2,Not for me,Too much emphasis on others' input and assumes greater professional level of activity prior to retirement. Doesn't anyone think single people below management level are worthy of assistance?
5,"Your Retirement, Your Way","Retirement Your Way gives a lot of great, practical advice. More importantly, the Birkman quizzes are fun and a good reminder that it is important to know yourself first before following retirement advice."
2,I cannot believe I am complaining about $6 surge protector! It doesn't plug into any of my Lutron panels.,"The design is nice, and, I liked its discreet On/OFF gray switch on the narrow side.However, when I plug it to the wall, I could not even plug it in! Another person forced it to plug in, but that would become a problem when some unforeseen overage situation occurs and I might have to remove it immediately. I have dealt with one or two melted plug situation, even though they were a surge protector once or twice.Anyway, if they are not good at first, I will never use it. Never with a doubt."
3,It works,"Don't know how to stretch this one out to twelve words, but the thing does what you want - if you don't need a longer cord."
1,"Just arrived, instantly died","Just got home and checked the mail and my new surge protector had arrived. Immediately take it into the house and open it then plug it in and test it with my laptop. It worked fine, for 5 seconds. Suddenly my laptop stopped getting power and the surge protector started making a nasty melted metal/plastic smell. So yeah, I think the thing burnt itself out instantly. I will be returning this immediately. I have no idea how this product has such a high rating, I read a few reviews that said they had a similar problem but I thought it was probably a rare occurrence, this does not seem to be the case, these are cheaply and poorly made, I highly advise against purchasing."
3,its a power strip,"its a power strip, I will know how it works when it does the job I bought it for which isto take the hit when I get a spike or a power surge?"
5,Good Quality,Good quality surge protectors. It will be hard to tell how they work unless I actually need them and I hope I don't.
4,"Pretty Good, minus one feature...","This does it job, meaning it supplies more outlets for a small old apartment from one outlet. The only thing I do not like about it is that the power switch is in a little alcove on the side instead of on the top so sometime it is difficult to reach, but if one does not like the switch on top then..."
4,luiginsky,"Works as advertised.I wish they would allow more room in between plugs, most devices that I want to connect have transformers which overlap the outlets provided so you can not use all the six outlets at the same time."
4,Just a tad costlier than it should be,"This surge protector is compact, well built and comes with a 4' cord. Generally 4' is sufficient but in case you require 5' or 6', this cannot solve the purpose. I don't understand why it is so difficult to find power strips with longer cords. If people cannot look where they are walking and trip on them, it is their problem. I use this (and 2 other 2' corded ones) mostly in corners and have not yet had any issue with them.This unit does not have an on/off signal light. There is an on/off switch which is very small and on the side. My wife ended up discharging her laptop with this as she wasn't aware that the switch was in off position. Make sure you turn the switch to the on position and ensure your laptop or other device is charging. Only gripe I have with this thing till date.Giving it 4 stars because of this specific issue and small cord. Probably a 5$ price point would have justified these omissions."
1,A Terrible Product,"This product arrived dead on arrival. I tried it in several outlets in several rooms with different computers but none worked. Due to the lengthy return policy, for the price I just discarded it. The made in China should have warned me as well as the price. Buyer beware."
5,Pretty Great for the Price,"I bought two of these surge protectors because my dorm room only has a couple of free outlets and I needed way more.I chose this one over the others because it was the cheapest one with the highest reviews and it lives up to that rep. Plusthe Belkin lifetime warranty and $15,000 connected equipment warranty makes it more than worthwhile for the price."
4,Cheap but it works!,"Its a power strip, and there's nothing fancy about it. Because of where it was being used, I had to find the on/off switch by feel in the dark, and since its not lighted, it was difficult to tell which way it was set (after I finally found it), so at first I wasn't sure if it was faulty or my new DVD player was. After a few tries though, I got everything working, and its doing its job just fine. Turn it on, plug stuff in, and go! This was a good, nicely priced purchase. I would buy another one of these if the need arises."
4,"Great Price, Great Product!",I have no complaints about the Belkin 6-Outlet Home/Office Surger Protector with 4' cord. It is very inexpensive to purchase through Amazon and works well. The cord length seems longer than most surge protectors carried in the stores which helps me work on my laptop just about from anywhere in my living room with it plugged in. The battery died and I do not want to spend money at the moment purchasing a new one. This protector keeps it safe while still allowing me the mobility expected from a laptop.
4,Nice product,"I bought two of these from Amazon with free shipping and they were delivered reasonably quickly. These surge protectors work fine so far, seem to be of good quality for the price and are nicely designed. I suppose having a ""name brand"" like Belkin makes it a bit more likely that one could successfully enforce the ""lifetime"" warranty and ""connected equipment warranty"" in the unlikely event that should ever become necessary.I would probably buy these again if I needed more switched outlets unless I could find cheaper ones of similar quality in stock at someplace like Walmart, which is possible but I've noticed that the Walmart near me is frequently out of stock on the well priced models. Also it's nice to save on sales tax and have the items delivered to my door."
4,Good item for the money!,"The product works fine, no issues. The on-off button is tricky to find, for sure, but that has an advantage which is, you will not accidentally turn it off with your feet if you have it below your desk.I though I got a damage product when I first plugged it in, but it turned out it was the switch which was in the ""off"" position. Perhaps this is what may have happened to some of the reviewers when they stated they got a defective product? Just wondering. It will be good if they can add a led to the switch, so you know if the switch is on when the led is lighted.As noted by another reviewer, I also wish there were a bit more space between the outlets for larger power adaptors such as those for cell phones, baby monitors, etc.Overall for the price I paid for this, I am satisfied."
3,Not bad,"I wanted something cheap that would allow me to plug in multiple electronics so in this respect Belkin has done Okay. The price is great and it's easy to use. Some people complained about the On/Off switch where the cable runs out of and I didn't find that annoying or difficult to find, though I've had many other power strips with On/Off switches. I find that feature useful (when going out of town, I just switch it off instead of unplugging it). Others have said that the outlets are too close together and that's my one complaint about htis product as well. They are closer together than I thought which makes plugging in and taking out difficult or very limited if you have anything bigger than a standard two or three-prong plug.Unless I find something cheaper or near the same price with more space, I would buy this again."
3,Not good Not bad,"Only ordered these to use for Christmas Lights, etc. They Work!!! There is NO light indicating that they are on or off or protecting the attached equipment. If You can live with that, then get these."
2,Fickle,"I ordered this product to replace something similar that had no surge protection. I was unpleasantly surprised to find that this was extraordinarily fickle. The slightest bump to the unit causes it to reset and, effectively, turn off anything I have plugged into it. I think my computer has already lost power about eight times because I accidentally tapped this ever so slightly. In order for me to even plug in something else I have to make sure everything is powered off, then plug something in.I did at first think it may be the outlet (even though I used something similar to this, without surge protection and had no issues), but after plugging in my old one I deduced it was this, and that is was ""touchy"". On the bright side, the cord length and outlet spacing was perfect for my needs, and I did not experience any problems finding the reset switch,"
4,Works Great,Plugged it in and it hasn't failed yet. I'll let you know if apower surge affects it. So far so good.
5,"Nice with Surge Protection and 4 ft, can't beat the price",I wish it was 5' but I can't complain as most cheap power strips or surge are now only like 2 or 3 ft. It's very nicely made and wider then some of the cheaper strips so it doesn't tilt over. U can't beat the price for 4 ft surge strip.
3,one came doa,Ordered three. One of the three was dead on arrival. I prefer it when products are DOA. The protectors that functioned worked according to spec.
3,OK but needs better design,"Although this is OK and Belkin is generally a good company, it would be much better with a positive power indicator (e.g. a light on the on/off switch) and a longer cord."
2,Worked for about a 2 weeks,"I only used it about 3 times, after that for some reason it just completely stopped working.Definitely got what I paid for.Never thought that would happen, but maybe I just got a faulty one..."
1,DID NOT WORK,"The product feels flimsy, and cheap. I did not mind, as long as it would do the job, but what a surprise! It did not work at all. I did not expect it not to work, since I have gotten cheaper ones at Walmart, and I have never been disappointed. For the price, I will just not return the product, but it was a well worth 8 dollars gone to the trash. DO NOT BUY."
1,Did not work!,"This product didn't work at all. I even called Belkin to see if they'd help me out and send out a new one. They would but i first had to send them back the defective product first and then 10 business days later or so i'd get a replacement. Their customer service was horrible. I asked them to send me a new one without sending the broken product back but they refused. Said i'd have to give them my credit card for that and still send back the old one. Being as cheap as this product is, they shouuld've sent me a new one right then, no questions. I won't be buying another one of these products. I guess i'll just have to return this to Amazon."
2,Bah,"Cheap and only works for a small amount of time. I bought these because after I was flooded out by Sandy I needed a few extra outlets because most were not working downstairs. I needed a few and because we were putting all this money into everything and were not paid by the insurance (and did not think we would be) we needed to get the cheapest ones. These are too cheap! Just spend the 2 or 3 extra dollars and get a better one then these, they look better and last allot longer...."
4,Fantastic Surge Protectors,I would recommend this product for any household that has more than one appliance or other equipment to connect and outlets are scarce.Vable Welch
3,Good,It's nice.Doesn't have a power indicator light so I didn't realize it wasn't switched on.Power indicator would be nice.
5,Is the Power On or Off?,"An excellent product, very reliable surge protector for the price. The power cord is 4 inches long and is very thick. The entire unit is heavy, this was built to be durable.One small issue that you may have is with the power switch. The switch is on the side of the unit and is white (no contrast with the unit itself). This makes it difficult to tell whether the power is on or off at a glance. If you're used to a power switch that lights up when powered on, then this one might throw you off."
4,Serve my needs,So far so good. Glad that I chose this 4 feet one instead of the 2 feet one. 2 feet will be too short.
3,How many inches in a foot again?,"I needed a four foot cord, unfortunately, this one is only 3' 8"" long if we're being generous.Also, wish it had a light so you could tell it was on, but you get what you pay for I suppose.Otherwise it does the job."
1,does not work at all,Would never have guessed that a power strip wouldn't work! I dont know whats wrong with it but this thing stinks. Sadly I already threw the box out.....
2,I'd buy this for $5 but not for more....,"It's durable all right, but the cord is too short. I get very limited range with this cord and pretty much useless... I had to get another set for its replacement. Don't buy it. If you do... you'd be surprised by how short it actually is."
1,"Didn't hate it, as it would have been perfect if it WORKED.","Tried it on two other outlets, but no juice. With a product name as well- known, this was quite a surprise.if this is something that almost never happens, okay. I'd like to hear from others, as this is a quality control issue. Is this a fairly common occurrence?"
3,Loose arbor bearing,"I've had this saw for just over three years and recently discovered that the blade has been shifting to the right a little every time I turned it on. It has always started hard, not like other older Unisaws I'm accustomed to, which I thought had more to do with my infrequent use and the belts holding their shape. The other day I started it up and the blade started rubbing against the throat plate on a 90 degree cut. I immediately shut the saw off and checked to make sure the plate was installed properly, which it was, and noticed the blade flush against the right side of the opening in it. I removed the plate and used the side of a ball pein hammer to gently tap the arbor and check for play. It moved quite easily. I'll repost after contacting DELTA about the issue.Makes sense why the guy at Woodcraft said he could order it but I was on my own after that."
3,a sinister turn for the Heap family,"For those unfamiliar with the series, its best to begin at the beginning, as the second book in Angie Sage's second book in her ""Septimus Heap"" series, things take a sinsiter turn. In a rather melodramatic fashion (somewhat reminiscent of a soap opera) as Septimus' older brother, Simon, not only refuses to believe Septimus is his long, lost sibling, but he takes up with the evil Dom Daniel. In a similarly dramatic turn, young Jenna's life is threatened, and Septimus must work to keep her ""sister"" alive while wrestling with the conflict of loyalty to family.The Septimus Heap series makes for charming young adult reading, and is a worthwhile diversion for those in withdrawal from the Harry Potter series."
3,Septimus' adventures continue...,"Septimus Heap #2.Septimus Heap, Apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard faces yet more challenges as he settles into his apprenticeship.Evil DomDaniel continues to attempt to take over the Castle as ExtraOrdinary Wizard by having Jenna, the rightful heir to the throne, killed. Simon Heap is the necromancer's new Apprentice. Fueled by anger at his family and determined to make a name for himself, Simon chases Jenna, determined to capture and kill her.DomDaniel's plot doesn't end there. He and the Darke Shadow that follows the current ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Marcia Overstrand, are in league to get rid of her."
5,This Rocks,The material used in this book was of amzing quality. For Harry Potter fans this will be your long lost best friend!
2,What Happened Angie Sage?,"Magyk was so gripping, I didn't want to put the book down until I had finished the entire thing. It was so descriptive, and in depth. Each character had a unique personality that really came through in the book. It was a delightful book, and I so looked forward to the sequel! I could hardly wait for it to hit the shelves!Flyte was more than a bit of a let down. It seemed hurried and forced. There wasn't half the depth of the book and none of the characters had much personality. I think she should start over and take her time and redo it :( I don't mean to sound rude, but the first in the series was so good! I can honestly say I'll wait for the third installment to hit library shelves. I won't be purchasing it."
3,seller very cooperative,Although the descirption was not what i recieved the seller was very good about resolving the conflict quickly.
1,Never recieved the item!!!!!,"I ordered this book on the 7th of November and it is now the 16th of December and I still have not seen it. But, my credit card HAS been charged. I don't think I will order from Amazon again."
4,A fun read!,"I read both Septimus Heap books to evaluate them for my 10 year old son and really enjoyed them! They are not ""Harry Potter"" quality in that they lack many of the subtleties of that series, but neither are they as intense. I highly recommend them for kids who enjoy the magician genre."
4,Great read,Great for all ages. Filled with fun and adventure this book is a great read. I'd recommend it for ages 9 to mid teen especially.
2,D/S or S/M fans this is not your typical fare so be forewarned!!,"This collection of stories was, for the most part, not erotic at all. I have no idea why the synopsis and the other reviewer would imply that they were. I gave the book two stars because it is about Masters. People realizing that someone other than themselves was in control. But.... and this is a big but.... if you are looking for your traditional 'me slave, you master' stories then forget it. Most of the stories left me feeling flat. Many had unsatsifactory endings and strangely detached beginnings. Eroticism is not sex and I know the difference between the two but most of these stories were not even close. The book would be more accurate to be advertised as a collection of short stories of self discovery by people at crucial points in their life. So if you like pretty vanilla reading with a twist then go for it.... otherwise for all you guys that want the unabashed d/s eroticism the title illicits then you'd better not get this one."
1,Septfontaines not Septfontaines,"Although Villeroy & Boch is a great company, the distributor sent the wrong item and would not replace with the correct pattern. Is shoddy work accepted with this distributor? I wonder."
3,i THOUGHT THIS BOOJK WAS VERY EXCITING .,THIS BOOK IS VERY GOOD AND KEPT MY INTEREST THROUGH OUT THE WHOLE TIME I READ IT.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A boy and his horse.In something of a change of pace, a horse book that may just be slightly more directed at boys than girls, although the plot stays fairly similar.Boy helps out horse in island shipwreck situation. Horse returns the favour. Horse of course is an impressive specimen and can do the fast running thing quite nicely.So, off to the races then go."
4,Good Read,"A good read, easy to get through in a short ti. An excellent choice for reluctant readers or younger children."
4,Excellent piece of children's literature.,"Everything about this story is ""larger than life"" - the shipwreck, the rescue, and the race at the end. It's a bit of a fantasy, but somehow it doesn't seem to matter... if anything, it only heightens the experience.Farley has a easy, pleasant writing style that will draw you in and never let go. Two thumbs up!"
5,A classic book,"I read this book for the first time almost 25 years ago. It quickly became one of my favorites and I started collecting the others in the series. I was very suprised to open a box of books last year and find that I still had all of the originals! This book is the classic, timeless story of the relationship between a lonely boy and the wild stallion he comes to love. I would recommend it for any tween or teenage child."
5,The world best horse book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hi, I read the Black Stallion and I loved it. Maybe why one of the reasons I loved it so much was becasue I love horses. I am sure that if you buy this book, you would love it. I hope some day i will get a horse just like the black, and i hope my friendship with my horse will be as loving, caring and as lasting as the black had with Alec!!!!!"
5,Adventure,I bought this book for my grandson. He has been enjoying adventure books but never one about a boy and a horse before. I loved this book as a child too. It is timeless!
5,And I don't even like horses...,"This, and all of Farley's other horse books, still remain vivid in my mind, 35 years after avidly reading them as a pre-teen---and I hate horses (I think they're stupid, dangerous, overrated beasts)! I remember excitedly going to the local library as a kid, anxious to read the next novel in the series. I'm going to buy all of them for my kids, and hope they discover these timeless books."
4,Pretty little thing,"This necklace is very pretty and seems to be holding up well for costume jewelry.The only issue: it was received without the chain which was supposed to be included. The seller did promptly send a chain but unfortunately, it was received after the holidays."
4,An old story well told,"One of the better adaptations of J.S. Le Fanu's classic novella 'Carmilla'. Being a Hammer film, there are plenty of bulging clevages, misty forests and bloodied stakes. But the film is most interesting when it examines the complex sexual politics of the repressed upper-crust community most of the action takes place in. As the vampire, Ingrid Pitt elicits just the right amount of vulnerability and raunch."
2,Should have been better,"I've seen this well before it was reissued and hastly withdrawn from the market since the Hammer copyright is a very hot these days! I can tell you this,Ingrid Pitt is wonderful in a story with more holes in IT than her pray. See it once than move on to ""Countess Bathory Story"" AKA Bloody Countess (a MUCH better latter day Hammer affair. If you can find it) Only if Anchor Bay could speed up more of the Hammer catalog to DVD...."
1,The Vampire Lovers,"With the exception of Peter Cushing and The two lezzed up charlatans the movie is boring and slow moving, but once you arrive at the nudey scenes it is very much worth it,all in all it is more of a let's wait and see some action type of movie since the plot is obvious than a real scary treat.More like a Treat only which is good enough."
3,TOO BAD IT'S NOT ON DVD,"This indeed a class act in in the vampire genre. A Hammer/Peter Cushing production well worth seeing. However, I found the VHS, which is not widescreened, of poor quality. Those English girls would be better off if seen on a DVD. I took off a star becaue of this."
5,Ingrid Pitt shines in her role,"In the ""The Vampire Lovers"", Ingrid Pitt plays the main role, and the story this time is inspired by Sheridan Le Fanu's classic tale of ""Carmilla"", though I have to say that Pitt's portrayal of the predatory female vampire is much more feisty than the understated Carmilla of the original tale. With her um, considerable assets, Pitt portrays a lush, sexy, and utterly ruthless predator, preying upon all and sundry, regardless of gender. The lesbian theme is quite evident and I was happy to see my favorite classic horror actor Peter Cushing (as Gen. Von Spielsdorf) in this as well. The picture and sound quality in this feature is above average, and I consider this as one of the better screen adaptations of Le Fanu's ""Carmilla""."
3,"Enjoyable, sometimes risibly so","This film is based on Sheridan LeFanu's ""Carmilla"", which had noticeable sapphic and surrealist elements. The lesbian theme is here reproduced, going as far as a PG (I presume it was released with that rating) would allow in 1970. It is in that and other aspects fairly typical Hammer: enjoyable, slightly exagerated,with some sense of atmosphere and fairly busty females. The interiors are colourful verging on lushness, with some of exteriors obvious sets. Peter Cushing gives his usual professional performance. Hammer films were derided by purists when they appeared in the 50s and 60s, but had a certain standard now appreciable."
4,"""I love you.""","THE VAMPIRE LOVERS is generally considered to be the best of the Hammer Films ""Carmilla Trilogy"" and the most faithful to J. Sheridan LeFanu's original story.In THE VAMPIRE LOVERS a frankly lesbian Carmilla Karnstein spends most of the film seducing and drinking the blood of several lovely young ladies in eighteenth century Austria.Like most Hammer productions THE VAMPIRE LOVERS relies heavily on stylism, and because the film is largely a straightforward retelling of LeFanu's tale, the storyline never sags. The sexual element is very much in evidence, serving as the underpinning of this film. There are a fair number of bare breasts and nubile bodies upon which Carmilla feeds, and the dialogue (much of it lifted from LeFanu) is classically Victorian and tastefully erotic.THE VAMPIRE LOVERS is an entertaining and well-made THREE AND-A-HALF STAR film, and possibly the best of its genre."
2,Mabuse Malaise,"German producer Artur Brauner's ""Dr. Mabuse"" series runs out of steam with this tired crime thriller. The change in locale accomplishes little, though a good cast (headed by Peter van Eyck) generates some interest. Despite filmmaker Paul May's best efforts, ""Scotland Yard vs. Dr. Mabuse"" (1963) is a pale shadow of the classic Fritz Lang trilogy."
5,CAN'T WAIT FOR OUR OWN ROUTE 66 TOUR,"We loved this tour of Route 66. We are planning our own tour sometime in the next year and will love seeing some of the sites in person that were on this video. This was a very informative, great video. We have watched it twice already."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I own two other books by Larry Ullman and am nothing but pleased with them; however, this one was rather disappointing. The coverage is overly simplistic, shallow and lacks substance. The authors also ""stroke out"" in the pointers section --which is a bastion of C programming. I suppose it's ""fine"" as a dumbed-down introductory text, but for anyone with even a little programming background this book is useless or even laughable. Definitely not one of his better ones."
3,Gentle introduction to C programming - Not a keeper though,"The author did a fine job introducing key C programming concepts and illustrate them using simple well-explained code samples.However, the book just doesn't cover enough depth and breadth about useful C topics for this book to be a keeper. I am not sure about the intended audience. Computer Science students should definitely get more serious books like C Primer to learn in-depth about the C programming language, whereas developers from other languages should get more advanced books like Expert C Programming, Pointers on C to start 'Thinking in C' and get more bang for the buck.I think this book is a good buy only for those looking for a job interview that requires C knowledge and you have only a weekend to prepare for it ;)"
3,works,"lets start off by saying, i hate protein skimmers. they are ugly, filthy, and in the way, but this one works on my 90gal."
1,LOUD!,This thing is just plain loud..air bubbles in a reef tank isnt good as well!..save your money it will probably arrive broken as mine did..pure junk! sad to see coming from a reputable company like marineland\instant ocean
1,does not work at all,"this is the worst product ever... simply check the myriad of online modifications that people have come about in order for this skimmer to work, It simply does not work at all. It is noisy and VERY DIFFICULT to adjust, again just see in you tube videos about modifications needed,,, do not waste your time or money."
2,Worthless,"This is a terrible product, it seemed to be fine within the first few weeks, then it turned into the worst skimmer you can buy. I originally bought one for my 90 gal tank, but soon replaced it with a skimmer that could handle the tank, I now have the SeaClone 100 on my 20 gallon tank with just an undulated triggerfish in. This product is only somewhat useful if you replace the plastic valve they give you with a brass one."
2,Save your money,Put your money back in your pocket on this one. Save up for a decent skimmer if you are going to buy one. Sure this thing is priced right but it is a case of getting exactly what you paid for. I have one of these and use it on a 55 gallon tank. I get some results but nothing like you would get with a better skimmer. I rate it a 2 out of 5 cause I do get some thick green/brown skimmate using it so there is my proof it does work. It seems to like to spit out microbubbles by the trillions so sump placement may be better than the hang on. I don't have room for a sump so I hang it on the back. However if you are determined on buying this thing or have the tools and materials to modify it to work better the price is right for the materials to use this beast as a foundation to mod. I can't take anything away from the Maxi-Jet 1200 pump that comes with it. I'll score the powerhead 5 stars...but the rest of that contraption still gets 2 stars.
1,Horrible Unit.....Will break easily,"I purchased two units thinking that I accidentally broke the first one, Every time I would attempt to clean everything the lower fitting would crack/break causing water leak. I would stay away from purchasing this unit."
4,Works well,Start up...yes but this is normal...took 4-5 days but had been flawless ever since.My only complaint would be that its a bit noisy! It sits in my sump and it is the only thing that makes noise from that area and its quite loud!
1,"Pump don't work correct, This thing is junk","Will never buy one of theses again, I've had 2 shipped to me and both of them had the same problem, Pump don't work like it's should."
3,It works when you have scum.,"I had just cleaned my salt water tank when I installed it. Two weeks in and no action. I then decided to clean the gravel and boy did the skimmer kick into action double time clearing up the water and foaming out the scum. I told this to a guy in the aquarium store I frequent and suggested I get a UV sterilizer. After the addition of the UV sterilizer my tank has been crystal clear, however the skimmer has not produced any scum."
1,Joke of a product,"Stopped working after a month. What a joke of a product. It did work great for a month though. Seriously though, if you buy this product, it just means you like wasting money. I thought I would be the one person this product worked for. Guess not."
3,Not as good as the old model,"Old model worked wonderfully which prompted me to purchase the new model. New model not nearly as efficient and have to ""tweak"" it frequently. Don't know what they changed in the past 7 years but something is different."
1,"Too General, No Specifics","This was not helpful for my needs, which was to learn about SPECIFIC functional areas at financial institutions where IT and eCommerce are being employed. It was full of too many generalizations like ""banks must provide on-line banking in order to survive"" rather than specific considerations for eCommerce projects. I also think fully 50% of the tape was dedicated to the regurgitation of internet growth statistics that would apply to any industry, which, in addition, seem rather trite and obsolete in March of 2001."
3,My daughter figured out how to get good hits!,"My daughter bought this with her own money. At first, we had the same problem as everyone else. We couldn't get any hits, just always misses. This was very frustrating. After a few minutes, my 8 year old daughter figured out how to get hits. The secret is that you have to pull the trigger up, not push it down, like you would expect. Within about 5 minutes, my daughter was making 40-50 ""good"" hit with each song. Try that and see if it helps."
1,AWFUL,"I also bought this as a christmas present for my daughter. It was returned the very next day! I had the same problems everyone else did..... the game did not pick up my daughter's (or mine, or my husband's) finger movements. I would not recommend this toy to anyone"
1,Does Not Work,"This toy is a waste of money and going back to the store as I type this. Every time you tap a note it comes up as a miss...NEVER registers as good. I thought it was just ours, but after reading all of the other reviews, it appears that this is a MAJOR flaw in the product!"
1,Don't buy the Bratz Rock Guitar,"My grand daughter has all of the Bratz toys and games that are pretty good, but the Bratz Rock Guitar got all misses even though she was pressing thr right notes and strumming to the beat. I play a regular guitar (the kind with strings) and I couldn't play the darn thing!! Do not buy this!!"
2,"Washed out colors, huge borders","The deck is stylish, however the washed out colors and huge borders ruined it for me."
3,beautiful colors,"I was drawn to this deck for the soft colors. The major arcana are very close in image cues to the meanings, however the minor arcana are less indicative of their meanings. I would suggest this deck for someone who is practiced already in reading. ^_^"
4,Small but handy...,"I use this 'fridge in my office to keep a drink and a snack cool, and so far it seems to work great! It works better if you put already-cold items in, but it will cool down a room temperature soda in a few hours. I have not used the ""warmer"" function. I worried about it overheating, so I've been keeping an eye on it and there have been no problems. It's a little small... hard to put a 16 oz water bottle in with anything else... but it fits unobtrusively under my desk and that's what I wanted. Also, mine arrived with no shelves, and the company shipped them promptly, no hassle."
1,Stopped working after a week.,"I had this for a week, and it stopped working completely. I'll be returning it for a refund."
2,Not worth the money.,"This was just not worth the money. My son is 5, and he thought it was boring. Putting the weather station together was not as easy as it should have been, and he could not help with that part. I'm not sure an 8 year old could even do it. Once it was together, it seems to be durable enough to stay outside, and we'll see how it works. The book that it came with was fun to read to my son, but the iceberg was so cheesy, that I just couldn't bring myself to do it. A plastic bag? I could do that with spending the money for a kit!"
4,Water for elephants,"The only thing I did not like about this movie is that I think that the actress used to work with Robert looks much older than him. They should have used someone at least a little closer to his age, but other than this, it's a good movie to watch."
3,Enjoyable But Lacking Blockbuster Quality,"I read the book and saw the movie, of which I enjoyed both overall. I was hoping it would be a blockbuster like the old film called ""The Greatest Show on Earth."" There were some funny parts of the book that I hoped would be emphasized more about the elephant and the circus characters. Albeit, some of the funny events were shown. I also hoped there would be more layers and facial expressions for the characters so that they would be more interesting. To me, the lead actor, Robert Pattinson, carried the movie and was even better int his movie than in Twilight. Reese Witherspoon is a great actress but I did not enjoy as much in this role. The rest of the cast didn't match what may could have made a blockbuster. I still enjoyed the movie as a rental but am glad I didn't pay to see it at the theater."
4,Good old fashioned movie,"A very good old fashioned movie which can still appeal to modern sensibilities. I saw this right after seeingThorin murky digital 3-D and was immediately absorbed by the crisp, beautiful cinematography presented in a big screen 35mm film presentation. Don't know how well that will translate to DVD or Blu-Ray, but it's a good looking movie. The score has a classic film score majesty to it as well."
4,Reese and Rpatz are great.,"If you like the novel, you'll be happy to know that the movie is pretty close to it. They didn't make too many changes, which I really liked. Reese Witherspoon looks drop dead gorgeous in this film, the best she's ever looked. Rpatz is HOT!!!! I'm a Twilight fan so I'd watch anything that he's in. Back to the point, its a worthwhile movie to watch and amazon has a great price."
3,marginal at best,"The screenplay was a terrible adaptation from the book. It didn't even explain the title ""Water for Elephants"". Robert Patterson was too busy trying to be charming to act his part. Reese Witherspoon played the only character she's capable of playing. Christopher Walz was convincing. Don't bother buying or renting, just wait for it to play on TV."
4,"Like ""Big Fish"" if it were a romance","I liked this movie quite a bit, although if I had read the book I'm sure I would not have liked it as much. Basically, it narrates the story of a young man (Robert Pattison) whoose life has taken a bad turn. He ends up working at a travelling circus where he meets and falls in love with the young wife (Reese Witherspoon) of the charming but tyrannical and dangerous circus owner."
5,Water for Elephants,"great movie, enjoyed very much and the family liked it along with the kids. I would recommend movie to all."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"What a disappointment! The best acting in this movie was Rosie, the elephant..and she got tortured to perform. The viewers get tortured watching this slow-moving, poorly-acted film. I read the book and surprisingly, this movie closely follows the book... although parts were omitted as is usual for films based on books. The book provided characters with chemistry between/among them; however, Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson have no chemistry...period. They seem to be sleep-walking throughout the scenes...including the romantic scene, which is so dark that even a good imagination can't help it. Christoph Waltz has an accent that interferes with his English. After 2 hours, I began to understand his sentences. I would have liked to see more of the Circus! An Oscar should go to the elephant. Forget the rest of the actors."
1,disappointing,"Very disappointing, not a very good chick flick if my wife doesn't like it. I don't even have the energy to write more."
5,Great price,"Couldn't find it in stores and when I did it was more than I wanted to spend, got a great deal and fast shipment."
2,Not So Great. Boring And The Characters Are Miscast.,I had high hopes for this movie having read the book. I was severely disappointed. They changed to much from the book and the characters where completely miscast. Reese and Robert are completely miscast for their roles. I don't know what the producers were thinking. On top of that the movie was boring and you don't care about the characters. The movie was not worth it.
5,Happy ending!!!,I loved this movie for many reasons but mostly because it had a happy ending. I have gotten so tired of these movies that think ending sad is popular? I am also a sucker for movies with animals. Great romance. Great passion. And did I mention the ending? lol.....
1,RE: HORRIBLE,I can't believe this movie has received the number of stars it has received. It is absolutely horrible! The Twilight star is incapable of any dramatic depth except the flat expressionless face of the undead that carried him through his previous vampire role. Even the talents of Reese Witherspoon are insufficient to buoy what is a virtually unwatchable film.
1,underwhelming,"I was looking forward to watching the movie but it was SO VERY dissapointing, I could not believe it. The actors and suggested theme were so promising:I wish I could get my money back!"
3,The Book Version is Much Better.,The Movie Version just like all other Moviesskips the Good parts of the original Book Version ofWater For Elephants.Read the book version instead for it isMuch better than the Movie Version anytime.
1,Violent Circus Animal Abuse,"Not recommended for children. Or adults! Had to quit watching less than halfway through. If you enjoy violence toward animals, this movie's for you!"
1,No Picture... Terrible purchase!,"Terrible!!! I was so excited to finally be able to watch the movie. However, the disc is blank and did not show any picture. The screen on my TV was black! I am so disappointed!"
2,Very disappointed in the movie,"The book is one of my all-time favorites to re-read occasionally so I was expecting great things from the movie. The casting seemed really strange and 'off' with no chemistry between Jacob and Marlena. Besides Marlena looking harsh and old, not fitting the part at all. The acting for most of the characters was dull except for Hal Holbrook as old Jacob, and surprisingly my favorite was 'Charlie' or whoever it was who took old Jacob under his wing. the only believable acting.The theme of old Jacob's life at the nursing home was just as important to me in the book as his young life at the circus, and that entire part of his life was omitted. I would like to see it remade someday with different actors and follow the flashback method of the author."
3,Lack of romantic chemistry between Pattison and Whitherspoon,"The same problem between Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in the TOURIST....lack of chemistry and romanticism. Scenes seems to be force,even though the stunning film views are awesome and entertaining, but not close to the book affairs between them."
3,It's a decent movie,"My 3-star rating is my own personal rating of it, though I think there will definitely be people out there who love it.The animal cruelty scenes were so violent they were really hard for me to watch.I didn't really feel the love story between the two main characters. I didn't think they had enough chemistry between them and to me it just felt more like a friendship where she felt safe.I loved the whole circus thing, and liked the main story line. Overall it was a decent movie. I'm glad I watched it, but I doubt I'll ever watch it again."
3,"Very different from the book, but still a good movie","For those that read the book and enjoyed it, you'll be whole-heartedly disappointed at the movie. I understand that movies aren't exactly like the book due to time constraints and other factors, however, I was disappointed that so much of the story was changed so much that it was basically a completely different story altogether. There were many parts of the story that the movie could have easily kept similar to the book, but for whatever reason did not.Three stars because it was a good movie in and of itself, however, it should not have been named after the book as it had very little resemblance to it to begin with aside from a few minor elephants...I mean elements. If you read the book, prepare to be extremely disappointed, even if you have the expectation that it will be a bit different like I did. If you did not read the book, you'll enjoy the movie as it is. Good acting, decent story."
4,Wow!,"I rented this movie online though Amazon. Since I wasn't sure I wanted to buy a movie that I wasn't familiar with. The 1st time that I watched, I cried over the animal & domestic abuse through the duration of the movie. I thought it was horrible at best. Because there was a 24hr time period to see the movie , I saw it several times and I did eventually get past the abuse of Rosie the elephant. I had to remember that the animals were not truely being abused on the film & this was just a movie. I liked the movie in the long run and am interested in buying the book to see what I missed."
4,Water For The Elephants,"Was a very good movie, almost as good as the book. Would recommend this to anyone, don't imagine you would be disappointed."
4,Loved Robert Pattinson In This Movie,"The movie was poignant, very well done. Had I not read the book first the element of surprise would have been there. I enjoyed the book so much better. I know they couldn't include everything in the book into a 2 hour movie. They stayed true to the book with no noticeable changes in the movie. I think Pattinson and Reese were good choices for the lead. I think the chemistry between Reese and Robert was good which made it believable. They made a beautiful couple. The guy playing the circus owner was excellent also. If you are looking for a love story with an element of drama, this is the movie for you."
4,Good Movie,I had initially read the book based upon reviews. This movie was so close to the book. I would recommend this movie. It is truly a very moving movie
3,weak film.,"I was looking forward to seeing the film, but was disappointed with many parts of it. I felt there was not enough character development between the the lead actors and even with the circus performers. The director had many chances to develop bonds, but they were passed over. Witherspoon and Pattison were miss matched and had very little chemistry. The last 20min of the film seemed rushed, as if they needed to wrap up the story fast! Lastly, they opened the story like in Titanic. Except with an old man telling his story. That was probably the worst part! They wasted a good 20min at the beginning and end with the old guy telling his story.....which (by the way Hollywood) has been done before and the novelty has worn off! A simple narrative at the start is all you need, or just give us the 1930's story straight up! I would say it's an AVERAGE film and would not recommend it to friends."
4,Never a Dull Moment,"This glamorous drama, set in the 1930's, centers on an aspiring veterinarian who drops out of college and runs away with the circus after his parents are both killed in a car crash. He must to grow up quickly as a result of being left all alone in the world, and then falling in love with a married woman soon after. His life becomes very complicated, and he is forced to make painful and difficult decisions. One thing that this film isn't is dull. The characters are very complex. There is action, drama, and the magic of the circus throughout. It is also very romantic and has many poignant moments. When it's over you feel like you've been on a long roller coaster ride.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"
4,Water for Elephants,"Good book, good movie (DVD). I am glad I read the Kindle Reader book first. It was more explicit of the circus life than the movie. The book also tells us more about Jacob and his change of relationships with various people with whom he meets in the circus community. I know it is fiction, but there were things at the end of the book and the movie that needed to be explained. I enjoy books with various characters employed as part of the story and this book does justice to that."
3,Book is better than DVD,Was disappointed in the DVD after I had read the book. They changed a lot of the important parts starting with the beginning .
3,A Circus Disappointment,"I found this movie pretty disappointing. After reading lots of movie reviews about it, I must say it wasn't what most everyone rated it to be. The acting was fine, but the story lacks something. I plan to sell my DVD copy of it."
3,Disappointing,"Rented this video some time back and while it was ok, I did not like it enough to buy or see again."
2,Not my thing.,"The story line was just not that interesting to me. I did not turn it off, it was not boring, the story line was at least intriguing, but over all not my kind of movie"
4,Fantastic,"I was very hesitant to see this movie, because I am a big fan of the novel ""Water for Elephants"" and I was terrified the movie studio would screw up the film version. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. The filmmakers did make some changes from Sarah Gruen's book, but overall I think the movie stayed very true to the heart of the novel. The cast was fantastic, especially the actors who played the three main characters (Robert Pattinson especially gets props for this role, which should silence any naysayers who claim the ""Twilight"" golden boy can't act). The movie reminded me a lot of the film ""Big Fish."" It was beautiful to watch but was also incredibly character-focused, with elements of fantasy and whimsy. I loved the movie and highly recommend it."
1,Bad DVD disk,Returned DVD to vendor 12/18/12 because of error on disk. Want a new DVD disk that works but the vendor will not supply me a new DVD as requested.
2,No Magic Between Reese and Rob!,"Not enough of the book in the movie. Reese's part is 21 years of age in the book and Reese, although nice looking, is not 21. Rob had great chemistry with the animals and even his male co-stars, but I did not feel any heat when Rob shared the screen with Reese. The sex scene at the hotel was very hot in the book and it was like tap water in the movie.I love movies and it is not unusual for me to see a film multiple times. I saw this movie two times, but only because my friend begged me to go with her to see it. I wish the roles had been cast with actors closer to the appropriate ages. Reese is not old, but she was just to old for this part.I can say however that I loved Rob's secnes with the dog, the horse and the elephant."
2,Diappointing adaptation of book,"Loved the book and especially the surprise ending. Don't know why it was necessary to twist the ending visa versa in the movie. Also, the great fire at the end was totally written out of the movie, even though they reference it early in the film. Robert Pattison made the mistake of admitting he got his first film job by lying about his attending acting school. He should have done less lying and more training. His pretty face is as wooden as a cigar store Indian. He seems totally lost, sort of comparable to Keanu Reeves. When you put him next to a quality actor like Christoph Waltz he shows very poorly. Ms. Witherspoon was just okay.Could have been a great film, I blame the screen writer, the director and the person who cast the actors. If only...."
3,"Good, but...","I thought this movie was really good, I just wish I would have watched the movie first and then read the book.. Doesn't hold a flame to the book."
3,Water for Elephants movie--read the book,"Movie was ok . . .the book is far better. No chemistry between Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson. Best acting by far was Rosie, the elephant!"
4,Great movie!,"I just finished the book in order to watch the movie. As per usual, the book is always better but the movie was also good. Some of the opening and closing lines were taken directly from the text. Nice touch!"
5,about this movie,"This movie is the most wonderful movie I have ever seen. It's not about murder or scary or boring. It's not a documentary about animals. It's the kind of movie you wished you had never watched so you can watch it all over again!! I will and have NEVER seen a more wonderful movie than ""Water for Elephants."" I actually sent my mother a copy from Amazon and I E-Mailed all my friends to tell them to watch it or get a used copy from Amazon because it's so wonderful. The name doesn't sound like it's a good movie but I guarantee you won't be sorry if you order it. Actually, I've watched the last 20 minutes at least 8 times and I will keep it on my DVR and in a long time, I'll watch it again. I just can't say enough about how wonderful this movie is"
3,CASTING DROWNS 'WATER FOR ELEPHANTS',"The book was light-weight and salvaged by an exotic and intriguing setting: a traveling circus during the pits of the Great Depression. In the movie, the casting is the main problem. Reese Witherspoon is not a very good actor with a crushed petunia face and limited depth. She's actually too young and 'cutesy' for the hard-edged role. Robert Pattinson has a smoldering sort of charm and may develop into a rather good actor. Christoph Waltz chews the scenery brazenly but at least keeps the conflict bubbling. Hal Holbrook, in a thankless 'bookend' role...the beginning and end of the film as the now ancient Pattinson character...simply turns in a variation on the Mark Twain characterization he's done for eons. Pattinson's legion of young females may love the film as they did the book, but it's not really much different from a movie on LifeTime Movie Channel."
2,"GREAT BOOK, NOT SO GREAT MOVIE","I just finished watching the movie and I am sadly disappointed. Some of the best parts of the book were left out and Reese Witherspoon can't act. If you loved the book, don't bother with the movie."
2,Nothing I haven't seen before.,"This ""story"" has been played out in many films before. All that's different in this one is it's circus theme. The acting and facial expressions by Robert Pattinson were both so bad in some places it was hard to watch. I wouldn't pay to see this again."
3,"great in some areas, not so great in others","The pluses of this movie are seeing the 'behind the scenes' view of what life might have been like working for a circus during this time period. Rosie the elephant was entertaining. The acting was stellar, especially the volatile ring master husband. The last five minutes of the movie were also sweet.The negatives. DEPRESSING. Violent. It wasn't a movie where you walk away feeling uplifted for having watched it. It was actually just pretty sad that people and animals could be treated that way. It's not a movie I'd watch again or recommend to my friends."
3,"Book was better, but flim was good","After reading the book I didn't think the story would work on film. I was wrong, although the film did not include some parts of the book, the film kept it mostly intact. It transported me back to my early years recalling the excitement of the circus arriving to our small town, but for the first time I got a behind the curtain life in the circus. The transition from present day into the memory of the main character's memory was smooth and well done. Not a great film but an enjoyable one."
5,Water for Elephants. Looks OK.,"Bought for a gift, so have not played the disk. Looks like new, so I expect it will be fine. Fast shipping, and well packaged."
3,I loved the book; the movie was so-so,"I still can't decide if the movie seemed patched together because I viewed it IMMEDIATELY after I finished reading the book. It was a wonderful story, and perhaps the screenplay tried to cover too much and had to cut some things. Or could it be that the editors had to cut a lot because the screenplay was too long? At any rate, I'm glad I read the book first."
5,Exactly what I wanted,This movie arrived exactly as it was described and when it was supposed to arrive. Cannot complain at all! Thanks
3,As always the book was better.,"Again, the book was so good. The movie is ok and worth taking a look at butI didn't care for the characters as much as in the book."
1,"Skipped entire movie, my loss",Hello It is my own fault for not acting sooner I purchased Water for Elephants and it skipped through the whole movie I packed it up to return but with the snow storms etc I tucked it away and forgot about it I wished I returned it in a fimely fashion I never got to see the whole movie
1,Movie Great but DVD was bad!,"LOVED this movie but DVD I bought was bad!Color,sound was not right. Terrible! Messed up entire time we watched movie."
1,Witherspoon shouldn't have opened her mouth,Reese Witherspoon has tried to voice her common Lib Agenda Speak in public and by doing so has earned the right to be categorized as an idiot. I have no desire to watch her act. Seriously. Our actions/ choices have consequences. I can't bear to watch her and she really ISN'T a good actress but JUST another mouthpiece for Lib Dems.If this displeases someone that's OK. This review is my opinion and as valid as any type of review.
4,RACER REVIEW,"WITH EPISODE 1 RACER NOW ON THE DREAMCAST FORMAT, YOUR GONNA NEED SOME HELP TO MASTER THE GAME!TAKING PLACE ON 8 WOULDS, RACER ZOOMS YOU THRU OBSTACLES AT 600+ MPH! WITH OVER 20 PODRACERS TO CHOOSE FROM, THINGS GO FROM TOUGH TO'WIZARD' FASTER THAN YOU CAN SAY JEDI-WANNA-BE!~THE PRIMA COMPANY HAS DONE IT AGAIN!"
5,the music industry has gone mad,"This album is fabulous. I hate that Chalk Farm is not given the recognition it deserves. Tracks such as ""Sunflower"" and ""Live Tomorrow"" give a dose of the true feel of this horribly underrated album."
5,"Absolutely solid, melodic, powerful -- you must own this recording","I bought this CD a few years ago after hearing ""Lie on Lie"" and it quickly became one of my all-time favorite rock recordings; those who hear it inevitably feel the same way and purchase a copy for themselves. Not a bad cut on the album, period. The songs are at once smart, powerful and melodic -- flowing on an undercurrent of angst while maintaining an element of refinement that flirts on the fringes universal appeal. Musicianship is great -- with a rhythm section that comes across as if these guys have been playing together since they were three -- and Michael Duff's vocals are soulful and musical. Why this recording didn't reach far higher levels of commercial success I'll never know (as a long-time musician, it doesn't give me much in the way of hope). I HIGHLY recommend this disc to anyone -- a superior effort from a band that should have gone a long way but, sadly, ended up somehow overlooked by the mainstream."
4,great soundtrack,this had great sound clarity. loved it. almost felt like you were watching the movie
5,surprising,"After watching this movie I KNEW I had to own the soundtrack. Talk about good-ole-blues. And Sam Jackson can sing!! Very sexy, very easy to listen to. (Not for the prudish though....(Oh, and the movie totally rocked!!)"
5,Awesome!,"An awesome CD!!! I really liked the movie, and absolutely had to have the soundtrack. Blues at its very best!!"
4,Black Snake Moan (Music from the Soundtrack),I've never heard the original version so my review is based only on this one.Pros: Samuel L. Jackson was meant to do hard hitting blues. His cuts on this CD can make you feel the soul of Blues.Cons: No meta labels. That means your CD player can't show you the tracks name as it comes up.
4,Blues on Black Snake Moan,Gave this as a Birthday gift to my hubby as he loves blues - and he loves this CD. I also enjoy the songs and they were an unexpected bonus when we watched the movie. My only (minor) issue is the language on one of the cuts make it inappropriate for family gatherings with children.
4,If you like the songs from the movie you'll like the CD,"This CD is exactly what I expected. I liked the music in the movie so I bought the soundtrack. It has about 7 songs I really like on the CD, which I don't think is too bad considering sometimes a CD only has one or two songs you really like on it. It's basically a blues album. Overall well worth the money I spent on it."
1,Sad Moan for Black Snake,"Black Snake Moan is one of my favorite movies of all time. But, that said, the soundtrack is a real disapointment. The music works really well in the movie but when I listened to it on the soundtrack is just falls flat. Sorry-but true.J"
4,At least this snake isn't moaning on a plane!,"On this relatively good collection of mostly blues tunes, the main curiosity item is to see how well actor Samuel Jackson carries off the singer role. He sings four songs on this soundtrack CD, and acquits himself pretty admirably, although the standard comment about the day job does apply here. Otherwise the theme is the blues, but actually several of the tunes swim in that deep, dark water where blues, soul, gospel and rock 'n' roll meet. I thought the John Doe cut was excellent, and I also really liked the R&B leanings of the Bobby Rush track, and the Black Keys song is pretty great too. The score cues by Scott Bomar provide nice atmosphere in a Ry Cooder-ish vein (smoky slide guitar). In all, the CD is a reasonably enjoyable listen."
1,For Kids not adults,Phonics Based Reading program was advertised as being for adults and children. It is not and it does not run well at all. When I ran it on my computer it locked up the computer so bad I could not manually shut it off and reboot. Also the program is not setup for adults at all. The games are simple and meant for a 3rd grader or below. Whomever put this together was amateurish and did not know how to teach with a computer. Do not buy this product.
1,Bar Stools,"Bar Stools arrived assembled together in a box. On of the legs was split. Tried to return them to Target, but was told we had to mail them back through Amazon. The package of the product was inadequate in preventing damage during shipment."
3,Did not work for me but...,"I have interstitial cystitis with inflammation and no hunners ulcers. I tried Prelief for 3-4 months and found that it did not make a difference in my bladder pain level. It may work for other people so my advice is to try it because different things work for different people and symptoms. Also, the price is not outrageous so it is worth trying."
5,A very different view of murder,"This was my first Christy book and since then I've been pretty much addicted to them. Miss Marple is so ever charming and gossipy, solving her cases like it was a neighborhood affair she desperatly had to look into. The only thing I disliked was the ending. It was too abrupt. Overall, it is a strange, and intriguing, case of murder."
4,Well Thought,This book was my first Miss Jane Marple Novel. It was well well thought and well done.The Characters are likeable and well drawn.The book just dragged.The plot was very well done.
2,Average mystery,"I have read better mysteries. In this book, the story develops very slowly and some details are repeated for every character in the story. The mystery was very average in this book."
5,Great mystery!,"This was a great book and the ending was totally unexpected. (For me anyway!) I wish Gwenda and Giles could be in more Agathe Christie mysteries, they were great characters."
3,An Ok Agatha Christie,"All agatha Christie books are wonderful. This was fine, but not the greatest.I will continue to read Christie books until I have read them all"
4,Sleeping Murder by Agatha Christie,"In her last case, Miss Marple helps a young married couple discover the truth of what really happened eighteen years ago in the house they've just bought by the sea in the South of England. Is Gwenda hallucinating or was it all just a bad dream? Is the house haunted? If there really was a murder, who did it? Miss Marple advises the young couple to ""let sleeping murder lie"" but, of course they don't and Miss Marple can't resist offering a little assistance in getting to the bottom of the mystery.What I love about Agatha Christie stories is that they are honest to goodness murder mysteries without the sex and the bad language. It takes excellent writing, which Agatha Christie was so good at, to have followers that made her the most sold murder mystery writer of all time. It was a page turner for me and will have you doing your own sleuthing as to 'who really did it'."
5,Sleeping Murder Review,"Of all the Agatha Christie books I have read, the characters and plot of Sleeping Murder are by far the most interesting of them all. Gwenda and Giles Reed are two bright-eyed New Zealand newlyweds looking for their first home in England--what they find in the house is an eerie familiarity and a haunting past. When the couple moves into their new home, Gwenda has strange feelings of deja vu. She has dreams of a woman strangled in the hall and she feels a certain aura of murder in the air. Miss Jane Marple tells Gwenda to ""let sleeping murder lie"", but she insists on thoroughly investigating the history behind her haunted house. This book was extremely intriguing and continuously kept me on the edge of my seat. It is most definitely a page-turner and the suspense and plot twists add even more variation and intrigue to what I feel is one of Agatha Christie's best mysteries."
5,Great Book,"I was unsure whether or not I would enjoy reading murder in retrospect, but I really did. The story is great. And, as always, Miss Marple trusts no one and is always present significantly. Great read!"
5,Guy Ritchie get your Camera ready,"i loved this book. i picked it up at the library. the name is catch as hell. it took me awhile to get into it and understand what he was doing. each chapter has one of the characters point of view. i think there where 7 or 9 main characters but more like 15 characters. the story is easy to follow and very enjoyable. i actually felt for these people and how they saw their life in their seedy underworld of drugs,pimps and gangsters.this can easly be made into a movie, alot like snatch how the characters intervolve which each other. i recommend this very highly and you won't regret."
4,"Smart Strip: Smart Idea, but Mac Mini is smarter","The Smart Strip worked great. It is well laid out, supports surge protection and has wall wart spacing on some of the outlets. But it doesn't work with the surprising Mac Mini. Did you know that the Mac Mini only uses 4 Watts when it is idle? I had no idea. The Smart Strip can't resolve 4 Watts, so it won't work with the Mac Mini, but it works fine with my HP Laptop. To be fair, the Laptop has an LCD screen, but it burns more than four Watts no matter what. The display for the Mac, a Dell FP2005W, uses about 45 Watts.I can use the Smart Strip with the laptop or the display and it works flawlessly.Kudos to the Apple crew for saving a lot of energy with the design of the Mac Mini. Kudos to Smart Strip people for designing a peripheral that helps me save power on the less well designed peripherals. Now, Smart Strip, please make that adjustment circuit capable of handling a Mac Mini and you'll have a great product."
2,"Good idea, but problems with use...","I saw this product featured on the CBS Early Show & it looked cool. I bought one for myself & one for my boyfriend's house to save energy on our computers.Great idea - but it hasn't worked well for me so far. Whenever I plus my laptop into the Master outlet, it clicks on/off/on/off/on/off endlessly until I turn the whole thing off. Grr.I DO love the idea of the master outlet controlling power to the peripherals, but I hope this product makes improvements."
3,Okay but....,"Alright this is an expensive device. The way it's set up, you have a single device control a bunch of other devices except those you want to run independently. So let's say you have a TV which you set up as the controlling device: when it goes off the other devices you set up to be controlled by it go off as well. If you have a VCR you can set that to be on independently of the other devices which you most likely want as it needs to be on 24/7 to keep time and record tv shows. So that's reasonably solid. The problem is that the strip doesn't allow for large or odd shaped plugs which can block other plugs. For a strip that's over $30 it should be designed so that doesn't happen. Also you could accomplish the same thing with two plain strips: one which you turn on when you need it and one you leave on all the time. That would very likely save you $20. If the automatic switching is worth that much to you then buy it, if not....."
2,Couldn't use with iMac sleep mode,"No matter the adjustments I made, it would turn on and off over and over when iMac went to 'sleep'. I gave it two weeks and constant fiddling, but I have given up. Two stars for layout and the unit has a good heft to it. Unit feels substantial and has a nice long cord with a flat to the wall plug. It just wouldn't work with my already power-conscientious iMac."
2,Not the right strip for my setup,I wanted a strip that would work off my of my Preamp to turn my audio system on and off.My preamp didn't draw enough amperage to trigger it no matter how it was adjusted and it introduced a very slight hum in my amp / speakers. My setup is better than average but this strip was not up to the task.As a note I have used one of these in my theatre for years without issue.
2,One Major Flaw - Impossible tuning for Computer Sleep/Standby,"I really wanted to like this product. It is a great idea and the design is almost perfect. The major problem with the design is a single $0.20 trimmer pot ( variable resistor ) that is used to set when your device is ON versus OFF. It is VERY hard to set. My computer in Sleep mode consumes 50W and in normal ON mode consumes 100W. Tuning the strip to recognize the difference between the two power states required about 1/10 of a degree turn - hard to do. What is worse is that even after I got it working once, temperature variation in the circuit would cause it to stop working the next day. For many applications ( for example, computer hibernate=5W, vs ON=100W ) this device works just fine. I can't recommend it for computer Standby however. If they would improve the circuit with a multi-turn pot, it would probably work great. I might try this myself after the warranty period is over. Should have been a great ""Green"" product, sigh...."
4,New interesting energy saving technology,I was not aware of this new energy saving technology. It takes the work of shutting down every day every regular power strip at my home.
5,Works Great,"Worked great out of the box. Very easy to setup, and looks great too. The only quirk in my setup is that my Sony Bravia TV is the controlling unit; the TV turns on to show the Bravia screen, and then goes into a low power mode briefly before tuning the input (e.g. TV) at full power. During the brief low power mode, the controlled units which switched on with the TV will switch off before coming back on when the TV hits full power. Not a big deal, but then again this is driven by the power-on design of my TV.I am pleased with how this device works."
1,Worked at first...,"I really wanted to like this product. It is a great idea and the design is good. I've been using it for about one year now.It worked for about a month then stopped working. Should have been a great ""Green"" product.I'm using it with my desktop computer. Even from the beginning, it did not work properly when the computer entered suspend or hibernate mode. After about a month, it also stopped working when the computer shut off. No matter how I adjust the the sensitivity, it does not work properly when the computer shuts off."
4,Attn: Mac Users,We have a Mini Mac desktop and were not aware (from Amazon's description) that we would be unable to use it due to a certain technological difference of PC's and Mac's. BUT... we contacted the manufacturer and they had us mail them the protector and they did a custom tune to it so that we would be able to use it on the Mini Mac! It took them about a week and they shipped it back free of charge. It works perfectly! I highly recommend it!
1,Doesn't work even after two days of tuning,"I had high hopes after reading the reviews, but sadly the negative reviewers were rightas my Onkyo TX-nr509 doesn't trigger the on-off action as expected.I gently turn the tuning screw up to where the unit on, but then the unit never turns offafter the Onkyo is turned off. Conversly, if I slightly turn the screw till the unitis off and turn on the Onkyo the unit does not turn on.If the price wasn't so high I'd have kept this unit as a regular power strip."
5,My Review Of Of The Smart Strip Power Strip,"I have had the Smart Strip surge protector power strip for about six months now. It works exactly as advertised and shuts off peripheral devices when the primary device like a TV, is turned off. I wrote a review on my energy saving blog here: [...]Doing the math, at our current utility rate of 12 cents per kilowatt, the Smart Strip will pay for itself in only one year. In the meantime, it is helping your electronics last longer by shutting them down and by protecting them from up to 2850 joules of surge."
2,Let VC Andrews rest in peace!,"This book was terrible. Complete paragraphs taken from previous books, same phrases and cliches used over and over (what's with Jillian's thin laughter?). Leigh's character is okay, and I suppose you have to suspend disbelief that this is a 13 year old's diary by the vocabulary and dialog used (she must have aced English classes!). One major problem I had was with the portrait doll and her modeling nude for it. Tony expected all wealthy teenage girls to want one - did that mean they would all have to pose nude for him? Whose parents (other than Leigh's) would allow that?! The outlying characters' names were weak - Mildred Pierce? Mr. Ghostwriter couldn't come up with something more original than the name of a character from a well known novel? Skip any books that weren't written by Ms. Andrews herself."
4,Web of Dreams,I liked Web of Dreams very much because it wrapped up the Casteel Saga and all of my unanswered questions were no longer a mystery.
2,ENOUGH ALREADY,"This book was AWFUL!!!!! It was the same old, same old that is in the rest of the V.C. Andrews series. The poor innocent little girl facing impossible odds, a lecherous close relative and a once-caring-turned-avaricious-and-cold mother. If Tony did that, why didn't she land him in the slammer? I mean, come on lady, there are laws to prevent and correct scumbags like that. Where's your common sense? And where is her father during all this? Isn't he supposed to see any time soon? What is his reaction to what Tony did to Leigh? As much a romance and mystery fan as I am, this was VERY hard to swallow."
1,A sad story,"V.C. Andrews needs some serious help and new ideas for books.I have read several of her books that disgust me.I wonder if V.C.Andrews was sexually mistreated as a child because all of her books seem involve sex and rape and disgusting things like that.It's sad that people read this sort of trash and that our society accepts it.I'm only twelve and I read her book thinking that it might not be as bad as the others and stopped in the middle because I found it sickening.I've also thrown out the books that I bought from her. V.C. Andrews has the potential to be a wonderful writer but she turns you away from her book when she writes novel after novel of this trash. I won't buy another book from her because of this and I hope people agree with me.As for V.C.:If anything like that happened to you I'm sorry, but it is horrifying at how obsessed you are about this kind of treatment."
3,Not quite up to par...,"Though it's a step up from the plotless let-down that was Gates of Paradise, there's a marked difference between Web Of Dreams and the first 3 books of the Heaven series. This book benefits from an interesting Nabokov-inspired story with a riches-to-rags twist, which works as a direct contrast to Dark Angel. The characters, however, read as 2 dimensional generalities, not as people. Luke, especially, was inadequately drawn considering the multidimensionality of his character hinted at in Heaven and Dark Angel. Unlike the Garden of Shadows prequal to the ""Flowers"" series, which gave the reader a fresh angle, a protagonist whose originality hasn't been seen since, and detailed background information, this prequal didn't validate itself in terms of enriching the reader's idea of the larger story. You'll find very little in Web of Dreams not told in the other books. But if you're a fan of the rest of the series, you're going to want to get as much of Troy Tatterton as you can."
2,Disappointing,I read this book last in the Casteel series. I was hoping for more passionate characters and passion in general. Leigh's character didn't interest me at all and she reminded me somewhat of Annie in the previous novel (whom I didn't care for). There were no new secrets revealed and it moved really slowly. So much potential is lost with the ghost writer.
3,An amusing comedy,"This is my first Jan Hudson and it ain't bad at all. The heroine is a delightful Pinkerton agent and the hero is clearly her match. Reading about them is a wonderful experience in laughter.However, I must say sexual tension is at a minimum. And the heroine's headstrong insistence at not falling in love gets irritating after a while. But the most irritating thing is reading about Beau's family, who were so wrapped up in maintaining a good image."
5,Romantic and Fun!,"Jan Hudson is one of my favorites and she outdid herself on this one. Amanda is charming and refreshingly different, and Beau is a real hunk. If you like humor along with your romance, then A Hitch in Heaven is the book for you. Highly recommended!!!"
2,More Fizzle than Sizzle,"Poor Uncle Angus would be rolling in his grave-- if his corpse hadn't been snatched, the ransom bungled, the body retrieved, re-buried, then used as a rouse to lure Amanda back to Beau and his sweet, but oh-so-eccentric family.The sexual tension between Beau and Amanda is almost nil. Chuckles are few. And that trademark sizzle of Jan Hudson contemporaries is in need of a trip 'back to the future.'"
4,Meets Our Needs.,"This boxer leash holder is somewhat small, but it meets our needs to hold a leash and harness for each of our two boxers. The holder does look really cute on the wall, much better-looking than a plain leash/key holder."
4,Flight simulator enhanced landscapes,"I have both Microsoft FS 2002 and FS 2004 installed on my computer. I first installed without trouble this Extreme landscapes to my FS 2004 and it works well, giving much improved detail for USA landscapes. However, I was not able to install the program to my FS 2002 program, which as mentioned above, is on the same computer. I emailed the program vendor (USA Extreme Landscapes) for support, but received no reply. Bottom line: a good program, with the caveat mentioned."
2,Not what I expected.,"I was under the impression this was and improvement or upgrade to the basic program, but it is not. It is a stand-alone program that uses some of the programing from the basic game. Certainly not worth the money."
1,Don't buy this item,This doesn't work with any flight sim I have. It is not as good as Google Earth is to fly.
2,USA Extreme Landscapes for FS2004 & FS2002,Game didn't add too much to flight sim 2004 but seller was very fast and reliable.
4,Many moons ago...,"I heard ""How Will I Survive"" in a club in Memphis. I never knew who did it, but I could tell Michael McDonald had something to with it, so eventually, that's how I tracked this down and took a major hit on the nostalgia pipe. Amy Holland has a good voice but if you didn't hear this when it came out, it will probably just sound like pleasant pop sealed in 80's amber."
2,Not so good,Worked fine until cat turned around backwards and just slipped right out of the harness. Not dependable.
2,Too Small,My 14-lb cat did not fit in this at all. I loosened the straps all the way and still could not buckle the straps.
1,Does not work,"I purchased this and it did not work when it arrived in the mail. Subsequent contacts have been ignored. This vendor should be on e-bay, not a reputable site."
3,Thanks for offering this to the public.,"It was enjoyable. After I viewed The Strangler of Blackmoor Castle, I ordered 4 more similar films from Amazon, 3 of them from Sinister Cinema. I am 57 years old with a legal background. I found it delightfully understated when compared to modern American thriller/crime films."
4,Fans of Italian Giallo..LOOK NO FURTHER!,"Do you love Argento(but of course) Do you love Bava(uh! huh!)How about old school Fulchi and D'Amato(YESSSSSS!)Well than myfriend here is a MAJOR influence Harold Reindl's STRANGLERof BLACKMOOR CASTLE...A hooded knife murderer stalks thedank corridors of a English lord's castle in this EERIEmovie. This movie has a masked maniac chopping off heads,flashingknives,and threatening to pierce the eye's of a woman with a pairof Diamond Drills(don't ya just love it)This German HORROR veryinfluential to the Italian films of this genre and a modelpicture to the young and superior ARGENTO! Strangler is amust own for fans of Giallo pictures and HORROR! If thismovie does not make you sweat with fear! Call a psychiatristQUICK!"
2,Not that great.,"This album has two good songs in ""Frankie"" and ""Too Loose."" The rest of the album is mediocre at best. I do not recommend this album. There are many albums that are better than this one."
4,Good Shit,this is definitly d-gens best album love this stuff.punk rocking powerpop at its finest and malins lyrics dont disapoint.check out 17 Crash if ur into this(...)
2,Misleading,"This book is well-written; however, it is more of a demographic study of philanthropic efforts. I would have liked to see more information from a practical standpoint rather than a psychological assessment for tapping into these markets. Generally, I keep books with the expectation that I will find them useful someday (if not today), but I took the hit on shipping and returned this one."
4,A Larger View of a Caring Community,"If Philanthropy is about building a better life for everyone in the world community, i.e. seeing ourselves as citizens of the planet; then, Opening Doors: Pathways to Diverse Donors, is a useful guide for thoughtful fundraisers. This book is a well-researched, well-documented look at different cultural perspectives on giving...how to include and empower those ethnic groups who are living the American Dream and want to give back in ways that are culturally meaningful to them. Bravo to Diana Newman for taking a broader view of community and studying in-depth what have heretofore been invisible groups of resourceful, caring people."
3,They get the job done,"These went together with no issues - all the holes lined up! They are constructed from particle board so there is little recourse if you have an assembly problem and probably won't survive too many moves. As recommended, I filled them with sand to improve the damping performance and have had no problems with them."
4,The Sociology of Theology,"At the bottom of every social system is a religion. Society will work to mirror the theology that underlies it. Rushdoony charts how Western society and the freedom it enjoys (unique in the world) is derived from the creeds and confessions of the early church as they were developed from the Bible. This is a profoundly thought provoking book.Sadly, Rushdoony makes some odd errors. His recounting of the death of Arius has some factual errors (wrong times, wrong people, etc.). These errors don't change the point of his story, but they show a lack of care that may or may not affect other facts in his book."
4,Excellent historical & romantic epic,"With the three reigns of Louis' XIV, XV & XVI as the backdrop, Ms. Laker tells a wonderful epic of four women, of the same lineage, who overcome all the adversities that many women experienced during this time period -- love, heartbreak, marital abuse, political strife, poverty... overcome by courage, self-respect and dignity.Ms. Laker creates superb imagery and historical accuracy of 17th & 18th century France, right down to the architectural details of the Palace of Versailles, as well as the political & social goings-on of these respective periods.If the historical accuracy of this book doesn't capture your attention, the romantic storyline certainly will."
3,4 generations of women with a backdrop of Versailles,"I tried, but I never could be swept off my feet by this one. The characters all seemed to blend together: when the women were young, they all had the same characteristics. As they got older, they all matured into a different set of same characteristics. Many actions and reactions seemed slightly off -- some from their historical counterparts (like Marie Antoinette) and some just from general human behavior. And the various romances and relationships never seemed to have any foundation, and therefore always felt rushed and flat. Overall, none of the people in the book ever really felt human for me, which is a pity, because the idea of following 4 generations of women through Versailles is fascinating. The execution was just a little underwhelming.Recommended if you like French pre-revolutionary history, but not recommended with oodles of enthusiasm."
4,Well written tale,This is the first book I've read by this author. I thought it was well written and I would not hesitate to read more by Rosalind Laker.
4,Beautiful Versailles,"The architecture and culture of Versailles is wonderfully brought to life in this novel.The author has presented a brilliant portrayal of the elaborate building that took place at Versailles under Louis XIV, aswell as the extravagent lifestyle of the courtiers who lived at Court. Contrast this to the lives of the ordinary people who live around the palace, and you have a valid picture of why events leading up to the French Revolution occured.This novel spans four generations of women, which means the narrative structure has substantial gaps in it at times, and yet this does not hinder the novel. The author has done a good job with this, as usually such lapses in time leave the reader feeling estranged from the novel. Yet in this novel the reader is able to see the consequences of actions taken in the past, which is unusual and yet refreshing.I recommend this novel to anyone with an interest in the life of at the French court at Versailles, and the French Revolution."
3,"OK, but predictable.","If you like ""happily ever after"" endings, you won't like much of this. It covers 5 generations of women and three kings. Louis the XIV through XVI. If you know about the Reign of Terror, you can guess how the book ends. I need to check, but I suspect that the author is a Brit."
4,"""When it works, it is magic""","What is the difference between a blockbuster and a flop? This entertaining documentary, directed by Bill Couturié, tries to give an answer to that very difficult question, thanks to an eclectic montage of clips and interviews.Truth to be told, ""Boffo! Tinseltown's Bombs & Blockbusters"" doesn't have the recipe for success in the film industry that so many would kill for, and you should know that now. I must also confess that this dvd is full of clichés, and doesn'have innovative ideas.All the same, I liked this documentary well enough to give it 3.5 stars. The reason is simple: it is a dvd about the passion for movies, something I identify with. What is more, I enjoy watching people that feel strongly about cinema talk about something they know about, even if they don't say something new. Do you feel the same way? If that is the case, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy this documentary too.Belen Alcat, June 2007"
2,Boffo Schmoffo - Nobody Wants to Know,"There was not much substance here but a lot of sugar and glayze. If you are looking for some great insights into Hollywood, this is not it. The doco explores the idea of nobody knows and makes out that it tries to get to the heart of why some films fail and some succeed. From a research perspective, you have to question the source. Largely Hollywood actors. They are great to look at but don't really have a lot of intelligent things to say. The studio execs and producers had a few more insights. One said that yes, nobody knows, but there are some rules but none of these were actually elaborated on or explained. A lot of glitz and glamour, but not a lot of intelligence but then again, that is Hollywood and probably the reason why its so successful. Everyone wants to believe in magic and nobody really wants to know the reality."
3,Production weighs it down!,"Fantastic performers. I had the pleasure of seeing Eleanor & her band open up for Paula Cole a few years back when she was promoting this album. FABULOUS live performance, excellent musicianship by ALL, and wonderful songs. This album however, sounds as though it was produced in someone's walk-in closet. Horrible, and this weighs down the lovely work it contains. You have no choice, however, if you want to hear the songs, you have to just try and ignore this. But definitely get this CD. It's worth it! I give 5 stars to the musicians, 1 star to the production quality."
2,Not Very Good,"This album is disappointing. A shame really because this is a really talented artist. Purchase her debut album (1993) titled ""Eleanor McEvoy"" for a real treat.In ""What's Following Me"", the electric guitar distortion dominates and Ms. McEvoy doesn't allow her strong voice to keep up. In many songs it sounds like she's whispering or singing tired. If you've never heard any material from Eleanor McEvoy, don't let this album be your first taste of her work."
2,A disappointment,"As much as I hate to say it, this album failed to move me. Eleanor's vocals certainly hold up well, but they tended to be overwhelmed by the album's production, which seem to be of the let's-see-what-this-button-does school of music making. Also, the songwriting doesn't stand up all that well; she needs to work on her lyrical subtlety, and on not always going for the obvious rhyme. ""Fire Over Head"" is the one superlative song on the album, and a good indication of the potential here. A different choice of producers might have pulled this off, but I think this album would have fared much better if everyone had just stood back a bit and let Eleanor do what she does best: sing."
4,Excellent wind down music,"The CD is so sweet and NOT annoying which so many baby CDs are. The first two songs are a bit more upbeat then a standard bedtime CD, but the rest is so mellow and loving. It's not quite as soothing as most lullaby CDs, but keep in mind, the songs are song by the Sesame Street characters. That said, hearing Snuffy or Kermit sing is somehow so relaxing. I don't know if it brings back good childhood memories for me, or what, but it just feels like someone giving me a great big bear hug.In general, I'd say the disc is better for winding down the kids then absolute bedtime music. But my 9 week old seems to love it anyway. She even falls asleep to the very loud and upbeat Sesame Street Platinum CD. I guess it's just feel good music regardless of the tempo."
1,puke puke,The only reason it has one star is beacuse I am technologically incapable of giving it zero stars. I hate this book with every fibre of my being.
3,Oui mais....,"L'écriture est plutt banale. Par contre le sujet est fascinant. Je crois que c'est surtout là l'intért du livre. L'impression de découvrir une facette cachée de l'histoire de l'humanité.Les 100 premières pages sont trop longues, et plutt ennuyeuses. On ne s'attache pas vraiment aux personnages."
2,Divertissant. Pas plus.,"Pour beaucoup de gens, ce roman de Dan Brown est une oeuvre d'érudition. Voyon donc! Prenez la peine de lire ""Le Pendule de Foucault"" de Umberto Eco et voyez ce que signifie ""Érudition"". Si vous tes amateur d'ésotérisme, d'alchimie ou tes membres de sociétés initiatiques comme la Franc-Maconnerie ou les Rose-Croix depuis quelques années, vous rirez au éclat en lisant les commentaires très ""Érudit"" sur les symboles occultes du héro Robert Langdon. Le spécialiste de symbologie Langdon devrais retourner en classe et relire de véritable maitres du symbolisme comme Mircea Eliade ou René Guénon. Bref, une histoire quand mme interessante pour le profane mais hilarante pour l'Initié qui, en lisant Da Vinci Code, verra plutt combien son savoir est vaste comparé à l'""Érudition"" de Brown..."
2,I dont get this book,"The writing is good, but I just dont get this story. Maybe Murakami is not for me. This book just did not do it for me. I am surprised I stuck with it till the end, but thats a testament to the good writing/translation."
5,Murakami's best,"THIS is Haruki Murakami's best novel. And for those who don't like his work, stick to shallower waters such as Vonnegut or, perhaps, Tom Clancy."
3,"Unique, entertaining but vague in many aspects","This book was my introduction to the works of Murakami. Having read a lot of praise for him finally I had decided to initiate the literature journey to his world.I can say I was a bit utterly disappointed after finishing the book. I sensed that definitely, Murakami had a unique and vast imagination. However whatever he had on his mind, the world his imagination created, was not described the way it should have been done. There are missing pieces which create some holes when the reader tries to make-up in his mind what kind of an image the author is trying to convey. I think of the novel as two lines which converge however they are both blurry and the one line they create is not clearer."
4,amazing,"This is my favorite Murakami book. I picked it up on a whim, based on the jacket copy, and it has become one of my favorite books.While not perfect - some chapters are a little loose - the story is one of the most intriguing things I've ever read. Alternating between the 'real' and subconscious every chapter is a neat trick that makes you ponder the very reality of the story. Which world is the 'real' world? Towards the end the story even turns a little Lovecraftian - Which was very surprising for a Japanese author. The books also poses one of the most interesting physics problems about time I've ever been introduced to. There were many themes in this book I agree with and wouldn't be able to articulate without it.It's not only greatly entertaining, it makes you think about the world a little differently."
4,"Please Mr. Murakami, More Chandler and Kafka, Less Sci-Fi","Murakami's blend of tough-guy crime writing, Kafkesque parable and science fiction here results in a novel that is considerably more uneven than A Wild Sheep Case (the only other book of his I've read so far), where he limited himself to being a postmodern Japanese Raymond Chandler, but is nonetheless a darn good read -- strange, introspective, thought-provoking and riveting (except for some of the sci-fi drivel, which is both long-winded and confusing). This book falls one star short of perfection only because Murakami has already proven he can do better."
4,Powerful Intro to Murakami,"This is a powerful intro to Murakami. I loved it and have been a loyal reader ever since. Inadvertantly, he reveals a great deal about modern Japanese culture. The translator of this book has done a superb job.Do yourself the favor and read this!iKnow"
2,"it is not my kind of novel, I just got to the page 60 and then left it","I made a mistake in buying it, I never liked science fiction, (or whatever it is this) the previous murakami books I had read were different, in this one I felt I was reading it by obligation, never engaged me, and given the infinity of books available to read, I just dropped it and began to read a Patricia Highsmith mystery. I am having an excelent time with ""extrangers in a train"""
4,A strange journey that I recommend,"This was a very different read, which is exactly what I was looking for.....and I definitely got it....not sure it is for everybody, but if you need something totally off the wall, that takes you away from reality for while, then I highly recommend this book."
4,Reality-Bending Oddness,"Murakami never fails to astound - I say this having read only two books but its clear from what I understand about his entire body of work that the subject matter of his novels might be considered a little odd (and I think that's an understatement). Hard-Boiled Wonderland is no exception.Unfolding through two separate narratives, Murakami deftly paints the pictures of two contrasting realities and the actions that inevitably tie them together. It recalled Iain Bank's `The Bridge' and Irvine Welch's `Mirabou Stork Nightmares' - both novels that dealt with characters inhabiting multiple realities.Murakami pulls off something wonderful and magical here. Not to be missed."
4,End of the World,"This is 'Alice in Wonderland' colliding with a strangely symbolic sci-fi universe. I see the shadowy landscapes and the brilliantly colored streets of imagination. This book explores the transition between dreams/imagination and reality. The slightly understated narration and the exaggerated scenery of this novel clash brilliantly. It is a ride away from what most of us are used to, so give it a chance."
2,"Kills time, nothing more","A bright initial idea and a few passages of lovely prose in the alternative world plot, but basically random filler to carry out the clever plot design. The characters are cardboard thin, the plot convolutions incomprehensible or arbitrary, the philosophy muddy and doesn't withstand close scrutiny, the whole story seeming purposeless except to carry out the predestined narrative framework. Nothing is at stake emotionally or intellectually; the whole enterprise feels hollow. It's one of those books that seems smart, until you really think about it. An easy way to kill time while reading, but little more."
3,"Great, until the end.","This book has incredible potential, it starts brilliantly, and the twist in the narrative is great. The only problem is the end! The end of this book is a real let down. I have just finihsed reading Wind-up Bird Chronicle, which also had the same 'problem'. Maybe this author just likes bad endings."
1,Not my favorite Murakami,"Went on a tear and read each one of Murakami's books in the past 3 months. Loved them all. Then picked up this one. This is by far Murakami's weakest effort. Had to set it aside after getting 1/3 of the way through it. Story line not close to believable - plot convoluted and incomprehensible. Characters are thinly described. Painful journey this was. Take a pass and try any one of Murakami's other major works (Kafka, Sheep, Norwegian Wood, Bird, Dance, West of Sun)."
1,Don't Bother.,"I picked this book up on a whim -- I was looking for something by a contemporary Japanese author -- and somehow made it through. This book is dull, especially the poorly written ""hardboiled"" sections (though those ought to be the most exciting). Perhaps the translation is at fault, but the language was flat and banal. Or perhaps Murakami was trying for the simplicity of good noir. If so he fails utterly, creating instead a juvenile tone that replaces ideas with cultural references (John Ford, Bob Dylan, and Ivan Turgenev for that highbrow feel). Murakami is especially inept at integrating exposition into the novel. The fable-like ""End of the World"" sections are better, but not enough to support this bloated attempt. Overall: really very bad, and nowhere near to earning the Philip K Dick and Thomas Pynchon comparisons he's garnered."
1,Hard boiled boredom,"Maybe I have not played enough video games, have not read enough cheap fantasy novels to really be able to appreciate Murakamis Hard Boiled Wonderland. I just find it tiresome and void of anything what makes life and literature exciting. I hope his original Japanese writing does not sound as flat and pubescent as it does in the English translation. ""Only where there is disillusionment and depression and sorrow does happiness arise, without the despair of loss, there is no hope""(pp 334) - Wow, how deep! Everybody who was as disappointed as me, should read Tanizakis ""The Key"" to get a kick out of Japanese literature."
1,wow.,"i haven't quit on a book in a long time. i'm a huge vonnegut and palanhiuk fan, so murakami was suggested to me. maybe it was because of the comparison, no wait, this book was just bad. poor transitions, bland descriptions, and i have to say just bad story telling. this was my first murakami, and unfortunately i can't try it again."
3,... As Murakami Knows It,"An alternately poetic and wacky meditation on the mind. Staggeringly beautiful at times, but extremely inconsistent, and not hard-boiled at all."
4,A Little Too Much,"I love Murakami's works, especially Norwegian Wood, but this one is longer than the others and a little too much Science Fiction for me. Although, I did read it non-stop - so he had me from the beginning but I feel many will not be able to finish this novel - they will give up on it without finding out what happens. It is a mind twister though. What is real and what is not."
5,Reminded me of Sirens of Titan,"Back in the late 60s I picked up a sci fi paperback called Sirems of Titan. Had never heard of Vonnegut, but I was hooked. After finishing 1Q84 (a stunner!),I needed more Murakami and I settled on HBWATHEOTW. Wow!I'm not into fantasies, but this one blew me away. I can understand Murakami's worlds. They give me hope and substitute for a heaven I don't believe in. He's a brlliant author. Just can't believe it took me so long to find him."
5,His best work,"I've read about 5-6 of his books now, and this is my favorite piece he has produced. Unlike his other books, the ending is very thought provoking and fulfilling."
4,A wonderful novel about the mind and the desire for immortality,"A wonderful and weird novel about the mind and what the desire for immortality entails (compare with Borges' short story 'The Immortal', you won't be disappointed). Fans of Philip K. Dick and Jonathan Lethem's 'Gun, With Occasional Music' will like this, I know I did. The first 100 pages or so can be hard going, at this point the novel seems to lack direction, but be patient and you will be rewarded. I am now eager to read Murakami's other works."
4,My first and it hooked me,"This is the second time, and I still love it. This is the book that got me hooked on Murakami."
4,"Murakami, Handel and a good wine","When I first started reading this novel, I opened a good wine, played a selected playlist from Handel and prepared myself for a book with fairy tales from other worlds. I was a bit surprised to find that Murakami's fairy tale was really complex and intelligent. By complex, I mean very well constructed. The book is an easy and funny reading. It becomes really catching as the author is able to give the characters a strong personality and allows one to slowly and fully follow the thread of their thoughts... obvious, simple and good philosophy which is good to hear from time to time. The misterious plot is of the type that kills someone's hours of sleep just to know what is going to happen next. It also gives something to the mythbusters to talk about as it has some scientific equations that are difficult to swallow, but I say if you're going to watch Mission Impossible, you'll have fun if you just know what to expect. This is an action book I'd recommend."
5,A OneGod story for all Monotheistic Readers,"This world has very Christian values but never displaces worship from OneGod onto someone else. It has a great dash of Old Testament justice without any faith-based elitism. Good people get good things and bad people get swift punishment throughout the novel. You may lose patience with Lord Ladnor's wishy-washy attitude though. Hang in there, High Priestess is just the right gal to drag him kicking and screaming into all of Destiny's traps.My favorite aspect is the old veterans who don't believe the army can be counted on in tough times without the kick-a## cavalry women to rely on. Oohrah!"
2,Mediocre fantasy novel,"The plot was interesting, but the novel was hampered by the lack of character and world building. Both the protagonists and antagonists are flat and simplistic.Seems like a good story idea that was rushed to conclusion to allow for a multi-generational trilogy."
3,Prophwcy Denied,"Not to bad. The pacing is sometimes every uneven or slow. The story itself is very good. It does tend to get wordy at times, like the writer lost the thread and had to come back around to it. If you can it free it is worth a look"
5,Even my picky daughter liked this book!,"This was DEFINITELY the best fantasy I've ever read! I could hardly put it down. The characters, plot, and setting were all winners. When I finished this book, I passed it on to my teenage ( picky, well-read) daughter who was reluctant to read it at first but was soon won over. If I'd had any doubts about this book's appeal to a varied age group, they were banished when my daughter started badgering me about getting the next book in the series! Kudos!!!"
5,I'm a Phil phan!,"Okay, Phil Vassar sure ain't your ""traditional country"" artist, but he's a GREAT performer all the same! This CD does a great job of showcasing his piano skills and unique vocal abilities, and has some really catchy, stick-in-your-head songs. A couple tracks are more ""light and jazzy"" than country, but they're great all the same. Besides the singles released to radio (like ""In a Real Love"" and ""I'll Take That as a Yes""), there are other great songs on this album. My fave is probably ""Nobody Knows Me Like You,"" one of those love songs that makes you go, ""Aww..."""
4,Great Piano Player,"Phil plays the piano like no one else. It's truly beautiful to hear. There is so much emotion in those piano keys. Although I think parts of this album are a bit too twangy or too country for my tastes that is all made up for with songs like ""Black and Whites"" and ""Gone by Dawn"" where it's just Phil and the piano. Definitely give this album a listen."
2,It was crazy!,"This is the first book of his I've read. I just got it because I'd heard so much about him.So it's amazing, the way he can make you feel that you are there, on an exotic vacation.But all it is, is drinking and sex! First they have a drink, then they have sex, then they drink somemore, get a haircut, have sex, drink, go swimming, drink, have sex. PLEASE.Well it is David and Catherine's honeymoon. But still! I don't think it was worth me reading... though I think he is a great author, the subject of the book was implausible and silly. You go on your honeymoon and end up falling in love and having sex with another woman? and your wife does too? crazy!"
5,A brillant work that needs to be savored not read,"With this work Hemingway created a rich, vivid textual peice. This is a work that does not need to be gulped down all at once. Instead, like a fine wine this is a work that needs to be sipped slowly and sensuously. TO read this book all at once is a disservice to Hemingway and the reader. Read this work and enjoy it slowly"
2,What?,This book can make you hate Hemingway. Imagine being trapped on a vacation with two young lovebirds. That's all it is. I really wished I hadn't read it. Imagine Farewell to Arms if it only consisted of the love affair parts between him and the nurse. Don't waste your time.
1,a dull book,"I am not much of a reviewer, but I thought this book deserved more than one person writing a one-star review. I agree with the other one-star reviewer who titled their review ""3 moronic people eat, drink, swim and make love"" -- except I would change it to ""3 moronic people eat, drink, swim, make love, and get their hair cut"". Perhaps it is worthwhile to read if you are terribly interested in literature or want to read all of Hemingway's stuff. After reading it, I believe that there was a good reason why Hemingway did not have it published while he was alive. Good luck if you are reading this book or have to read it for a course."
2,The Garden of Eden? Hmmmm......,"This book starts out great, it romantisizes Europes beachs and 'charming' towns. The main characters are nice and everything is perfect. Then, the book decends into perversion and drinking/sex/drinking/sex and somewhere comes a side story about an elephant hunt. It's an ok read but not for younger readers."
4,The Promise of Post-War Hemingway,"The Garden of Eden is both a frustrating and fascinating work. Part of Hemingway's posthumous, unpublished manuscripts, the work shows the late Hemingway fighting to redefine himself as an artist. This work deals with gender issues, the nature of creativity, colonialism and post-colonialism. These were all meaty topics for post-war writers, and here Hemingway led the pack. But his failing mental and physical health prevented him from completing this project.This edition of The Garden of Eden is a significant reduction of the original manuscript. An entire parallel plot was eliminated; the editor decided to close the novel even though the manuscript continues for some 80 pages.Yet even with its shortcomings, Eden is a surprising rich and nuanced narrative. It tackles big issues but keeps its eye on the important thing in the novel, the story. There is some of Hemingway at his best here, in flashes of exacting detail rendered with a few, decisive words."
4,The Garden of Eden,"The first book i every read by the famous Ernest Hemingway.Read in the dead of winter in snowyMaine ,it transported me to the South of France completely. I always thought Hemingway too macofor me ,with his bull fighting & killer instinct. As he hunted every thing that moved across theworld. But i found he was also able to portray with delicacy ,complex relationships & love.I loved this book & it encouraged me to give Hemingway another chance.i have since read & enjoyedmay more of his books & short stories. Amazon.com gave me great service."
4,"A surprisingly good novel, but is it Hemingway?","Garden of Eden was published approximately 20 years after Hemingway's death. Carlos Baker, author of one of the most thorough Hemingway biography, described the manuscript as being lengthy and not very good. Thus, many were surprised when Garden of Eden was published in a shortened version, and was quite good. The novel explores themes of sexuality not touched on in Hemingway's other works, but present in his life. The writing, while not his absolute best, compares quite favorably to Old Man and the Sea, and Across the River and Into the Trees. It is far superior to Islands in the Stream, Hemingway's other major posthumous work. It is impossible to know how much of the strength of this book is due to the editing or comes from the original manuscript. Nevertheless, it deserved to be published and should be read by anyone who admires Hemingway's work."
4,"Interesting, engaging, but little lasting impact.","The first posthumously published book I've read of Hemingway, it was an interesting side of him to read. Just a little naughty, without the slightest hint of perversity, Hemingway tackles this complicated situation with skill and precision. It's not the story of a swinger. It's the story of a regular guy trying to make sense of the unusual situation he has become entangled in."
4,A great departure that works brilliantly,"For those that are familiar with Hemingway and his work and who have not read ""The Garden of Eden,"" I think you will find the novel to be a significant departure from Hem's normal fare - and a refreshing one. Although strongly similar in style and form, the novel tackles issues of male and female relationships and sexuality head on, in a way that one typically does not see in Hem. Here, however, instead of blinking at the bright light of sexual relations, Hemingway stares straight at it and courageously exorcises some personal hang ups about the dangers of loving someone too much. I heartily reccomend this novel for a new look at Hemingway and his views on women and love."
3,Quite boring...,"Hemingway failed to engage me in this particular story.Perhaps, in this day in age, the antics of this goofy sexual saga, lacks enough juice and shock value to carry us through it with interest or enthusiasm.In addition, I found that his writing style was quite different than in his other works...Somewhat boring and disappointing"
3,Twisted,"Hemingway began this novel beautifully by describing the European coast and the hills of France and Spain. However, it took a twist when it began tale of lesbians and homosexuality."
1,Garden of Eden Kindle,"So, the Kindle version of an old novel, The Garden of Eden by Hemingway is more expensive than the paperback? This is not why I signed up for a Kindle. The last four books I searched for are not available on Kindle. Others new books are about $2 less than the hardcover through Amazon. Plus, the Kindle versions don't have photographs or images. I'm not happy."
5,Maybe his best,"I've read lots of Hemingway and this is the only one I've read more than twice. This may be his best book other than the simple, succinct beauty of the old man in the sea. The dialogue in this book is fun, naughty, deviant. There are more to the lines than the surface, as in most hemingway. A lot of psychological things are going on. This book provides a glimpse into the internal world of hemingway as he deals with women, his father, his writing, his drinking, his style. It allows you to sort of understand how certain things effected him, most notably: His father's suicide, his first wife losing a briefcase of his short stories on a train, and his mother dressing him up as a girl until he was 6. Hemingway was tough, but in this book, you see that he was also tender and very, very psychological. One of the great short reads of my life."
3,"Two books, and one of them is actually top shelf....","Really two different books, one compelling and one lurid. The 'good' book shows Hemingway's character David Bourne as a writer. The approach to writing, feelings about it and the narratives he creates are interesting and rewarding. Additionally, Hemingway's overall descriptions of Madrid, the Cote d'Azure and the food they eat are top shelf.The second book varies wildly between gripping (how David's wife Catherine deals with her jealousy and ultimately mental illness) and banal. The love triangle they participate in gets repetitive and could have benefited from a good editor.Overall, I wouldn't put this as one of his best but I think it is worth reading to gain insight into Hemingway's 'issues' as well as his craft."
3,Pained...,"Like being taken off to a place you didn't want to be and having to stay longer than you thought necessary. Eventually, finding areas of interest, but a growing dislike for the people around you and even finding a few places (a very few pages) disturbing enough not to visit.Not until the end do you realize how near to the end of your visit, that despite the ongoing aggravation, the stay was almost addictive. ...a breathing sigh of relief to be done.I've been to ""The Garden of Eden"" and wish not to return."
4,A sensual and frightening view of the Bourne's honeymoon,"This novel was intriguing, frightening and one of the most sensual books that I have ever read. The book could also be catagorized as a suspense novel, as this emotionally flawed and physically beautiful couple were so volatile and daring. I felt as if Hemmingway had allowed his Katherine of ""A Farewell to Arms"" to come back to life and live without rules or mortality. The tragedy of this relationship haunted me during the reading and for weeks after."
2,Installed on our company billboard... Weak results,"This is a very expensive product. Make no mistake; it is very loud and irritating. We have a billboard that is infested with pigeons. The system was installed at great expense. The birds flutter away every time the audio option comes on, but fly right back down once it shuts up. I don't see any discernable results from the ultrasonic component. The product has reduced bird numbers by maybe 15% to 25%. Perhaps over time it will irritate nesting populations enough to drive the majority off, but that is yet to be seen. Bottom line, this is no quick fix, it is noisy, and far from fool proof. I think the claims made of this product in its description are exaggerated."
1,Wrong quantity,"I only got pack of 12 but not as it was said pack of 48,because my husband placed this order, When i got the package i just felt strange they used a so big box for this small stuff,, and I did not realize the quantity was wrong until today I checked my account. But now I already finished most cookies ,and I think everything is late ."
3,"Little filling, disappointed in quality of product","Oreos have gone downhill in quality. Little creme filling and mostly chocolate cookie. Recommend Newman's equivalent, much more filling and great tasting."
4,keeps cookies tasting fresh and crunchy,"These are always going to be more expensive than buying the single big pack - remember when oreos were packed into three plastic tubes in a plastic box.These oreos always come out crunchy with a very pliable filling that can be easily nudged-rolled off if you don't like the filling. If Nabisco sold individually wrapped cookies, I'd pay the extra money as I usually only want one cookie.I will always choose to buy oreos packaged in as small a serving as possible despite the expense unless I get some kind of vacuum sealer."
5,OREOs are some of the best,"These are great tasting cookies... great with milk, even for a grown-up. The packages are convenient, each containing six cookies. Don't know what else to say...5 stars as long as you get a decent/good deal on them."
3,ADS work JUST FINE,"dont know what you bleepin blips are talking about....Have had no problems with a {G3}--EMPHASIS-- G3 ibook mac and iMovie capturing analog video thru a TV.Yes, it works from a DVD player.Sound like the problems yall are having is incomplete computer issues.DEFRAG like mad if you work with digital video.This should be a no brainer.Ensure your system meets specs BEFORE buying the capture device. I have had NO issues with it, except finding a power cord because i bought mine from a merchant in Dubai while overseas.WORKS LIKE a CHARM!"
1,Adobe Software not compatible with AMD,"Another incompatibility problem with this product. The Adobe software that comes with the product is not compatible with any 32 bit AMD chip. Again, no warning when buying. Wait to you get it out of the box and setup, until you find out the software doesn't work. Great!"
1,NOT GOOD FOR MACS!!!,"I bought this product to capture fotage from a vcr to my computer.ADS has serious problems working with imovie and final cut. The image is choppy and skips frames.I spent endless hours trying to fix it, downloading drivers etc..I e mailed ADS customer service about a week ago and I have not got anything back from them. I have a Canopus ADVC-100 on order. it was a little bit more , but it looks like it has no problems. Don't use this if you have a MAC!!! Check the link to the forum below if you don't believe mewww.creativecow.net/index.php?forumid=22"
1,Does not work as advertised,"This product cannot reliably capture from an analog video source. It will skip frames every so often. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you are capturing an analog video source such as VHS. ADS knows about the problem but has not yet fixed it. If you are capturing from a digital source such as TiVo or a DVD, this product can do that."
2,Succumbs to caricature,"2 1/2There are clues abound that point to the classy merging of jazz-hop that could have been, but those end up merely being well-honed lines amidst misfired collaborations complete with cornball voiceovers."
1,The Empire of the Ants,"Joan Collins appeared bored through most of the film. The box cover is a sale ploy. You never see Miss Collins dressed that way in the movie.Robert Lansing had some great moments as the fearless boat skipper. His performance was believable.The special effects were bad. The music was not memorable.Another thing: half way through the movie it goes from bad science fiction to twilight zone when the survivors reached the town. They may have escaped the radioactive ants, but escaping the zombie townspeople will be harder.The movie ends in a sugar factory. Burnt sugar and roasted ants do not make an appetizing dish.This movie and the H.G. Wells' short story have nothing in common. Read the short story."
1,Empire of the Brainless,"Perhaps the synopsis should be reversed. It should read, ""Will the leaders of giant ant community succeed in enslaving these obnoxious human beings? Will the ants be able to eat the humans without having indigestion?""If one were to look up the word ""stupid movie"" in the dictionary, you'd see the words ""Empire of the Ants"" right underneath it as the definition.If you want good acting and a very suspenseful plot, watch something else!If you want to watch the dictionary definition of ""stupid"", watch this!"
2,"Just Awful, Really","""Empire of the Ants"" is awful, just awful, even with Joan Collins and Johnathan Lansing providing the leads. I generally enjoy bad Sci-Fi movies from the 1970s, but this is not very good on any level.No plot spoilers from me; the story centers around a shady real estate developer Marilyn Fryser (Collins) that is trying to unload worthless plots on a group of would be investors. Unfortunately the land is already claimed by ants, giant ants, and they have a plan! The acting is typical '70s, the plot is actually fairly good (based on an H.G. Wells story), but the special effects are really just as bad as they come (seriously I have seen 1940's movies with better effects).This is actually watchable but not really enjoyable.CFH"
3,EMPIRE OF ONCE FAMOUS ACTORS,"Let's see, we have: Joan Collins in her pre-Dynasty days; Robert Lansing from the tv series ""Twelve O'Clock High,"" Robert Pine and Jacqueline Scott from countless B movies and tv series; Albert Salmi from his Daniel Boone days; Edward Power from the old soap opera ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"" and the ubiquitous John David Carson who peopled many B movies during the seventies. Put them in the hand of schlock bug master Bert I. Gordon, and you have ""Empire of the Ants.""This is one of those painfully bad films that makes you laugh at its cheesiness. Do the ants EVER really look like they're in the film? Credit Gordonf for his sharp use of moving cameras, screams and loud music to subterfuge most of the ant attacks; they at least give it some tension. I do think Joan Collins deserved a more fitting death than dying from ant gas, though!A drive in delight!"
1,Not a 1998 movie!,"I assumed this video had something to do with the 1998 book, ""Empire of the Ants,"" or H.G. Wells' story. What I received was a 1977 Joan Collins sub-B horror flick about (poorly photographed) giant ants. Need more info on titles! END"
1,"inaccurate, god-awful waste of paper","words cannot describe the utter distain and disgust I felt after thumbing through this piece of garbage. I recieved this attrocity as a christmas present, and only out of pure obligation, removed the plastic wrapping while a well-meaning relative looked on. This embarassment to motorcyclists everywhere, was chock-full of complete inaccuracies and half-truths. I suppose it would be a good addition to your library if you like the idea of people thinking that you're into bikes, even though you've never even sat on a chopper. Let alone, build or ride one. If you're the type of imbecile who would like this book, and then write a positive review about it, then my warning is most likely falling upon deaf ears. I wish more than anything that a negative score was possible with this review, because one star is far too much praise. So thank you Mike Seate, you ruined christmas."
1,Unfactual attrocity,"I recieved this book as a Christmas gift, which is the only way it would have made it into my house. It is full of historical inaccuracies, poor commentary, and even poorer analogies by the said author. How this person is even able to get anything published, especially something this awful, is quite beyond me. How about doing some actual research, Seate? I actually felt somewhat insulted by the blatantly piss-poor information this book has to offer. Topical errors and inaccurately placed photoghraphs are the norm for this publication. Now obviously, this is a great book for newbies and yuppies who have no idea how the chopper ""subculture"" came about, or who think that Jesse James invented the chopper for the sake of Discovery programs, as other reviews of this book have led us to believe. But for us few who know how it really goes down, this book is a heap and a joke, save for a few nicely detailed photos, hence my 1-star rating."
3,"A Little Overpriced, But At Least OCC Isn't A Main Feature","This book costs quite a bit and quite honestly some of the builders in this book are not chopper builders, they're custom bike builders, however a few of the featured builders are worth a look. The main thing was that the OCC clowns are not featured at all which is a plus in my book and Jesse James doesn't make an appearance either, meaning all the reality tv stars are kept on the Discovery Channel where they belong rather than on the pages of this book. Aside from the price, the book was alright, however as I said not all of these guys are chopper builders. One German guy looks like he's building fiber glass, BMW style bikes that I wouldn't consider choppers in the least."
3,It's a Disk,"I bought this several years ago. It was great at that time but I'm sure it is obsolete. I don't even know where I've put it now. At the time, the disk worked just fine. Can be used as coasters."
1,Poor product.,"At the time I purchased this product, I could not get it to work properly and it was difficult finding a reader that would read the data. There are so many better options now like flash drives and memory sticks. So I cannot recommend this to anyone."
1,Stinky cheese really stinks,"While my husband was in Europe he told me of some ""stinky cheese"" that he had and loved while there. Unfortunately he did not remember the name. Sad to say not all ""stinky cheeses"" are a like. This one stunk VERY BAD and tasted just as bad as it smelled. I could not eat it and ended up throwing it away."
2,The jigsaw that wouldn't fit,"Every year over the holidays, the wife and I like to do jigsaw puzzles. We were quite excited about tackling this puzzle and had intended on banging it out, gluing it, and hanging in on our youngest's wall.As most folks do we separated out the border pieces from the rest of the puzzle and began to try and assemble the frame of the puzzle. To our surpise, the pieces fit together so poorly that we could put a single piece in several places.After a failed attempt to assemble the border, we decided that maybe we could do this one from the inside out. Naturally, we failed at this as well as we found that all the pieces fit together too poorly to assemble the puzzle and maintain our sanity.The puzzle truly is beautiful and the poster included within is really nice; but in my mind they really cut corners on the quality of the puzzle cut making it unassembleable.I wouldn't recommend buying this puzzle unless you have saint-like patience or you are glutton for punishment."
4,Found in UK,"I have completed 2 of the 3 winnnie the pooh puzzles. The borders are hard to finish because it seems like some pieces can fit in different places, but after that it is a very fun challenge to complete these beautiful puzzles.I actually found the Rescuing piglet puzzle online at a UK website for F 9.99. Much cheaper than the price here."
3,More a 2.5 star book,"I've been reading Barbara Delinsky for years. Recently though I haven't enjoyed the novels as much. I can't really put my finger on why.In any case, this was an okay read. The premise was interesting, as was the glimpse into the married lives of the neighborhood. But it never really grabbed my attention. The characters were not particularly likeable. You never really get to know much about Gretchen, so she isn't the most sympathetic of characters. Graham seems kinda disconnected and oblivious about his wife's problems with his family. There are hints as to his marital history and why he behaves the way he does, but frankly, this needed more development. The ending for Graham and Amanda seemed abrupt and hurried. Sort of a slapdash, happily ever after ending without actually working through their problems.I guess I'm giving this 2.5 stars because I like Barbara Delinsky's work generally, and am not ready to give her work thumbs down."
1,An insult to women; read it to lower your IQ,"I'd give it a negative number rating if I could. As another reviewer notes, you just don't care who fathered the neighbor's baby. This drones on for pages and pages. The ""plot"" could have been cut by two-thirds. I had to start skipping ahead. None of the women have any spunk, and the fact that the wives believe ALL of the husbands had the potential (not just the opportunity, but the potential) to be unfaithful doesn't say much for these marriages. You dislike all the characters equally. Even worse, the idea that if you just love each other enough and in the right way you'll finally be able to conceive a baby is incredibly insulting. Get this book off the bestseller list by making a different purchase."
4,My neighborhood too!,"The was a really enjoyable book to read. The charactors were well defined. I felt like I was one of the neighbors as well,sharing their fears and concerns. This could be my neighborhood. A delight for any reader!"
2,Don't waste your time.,The story is pretty good. But everything is repeated over and over and over..... It is so obvious that the author had 'so many pages' requirement for this book.I did not get to the very end of the book. Just lost interest due to all this repetition. It is a shame that a story with such strong potential turned into such a boring book.
3,A little unbelievable,"A story set in an upscale Connecticut neighborhood focuses on the lives of its residents; three couples living their lives and dealing with the trials and tribulations of marriage, parenthood and infertility. The characterization in this story was very well done, and you'll no doubt find yourself sympathizing with some of the situations they find themselves in and perhaps even relating. What I found completely unbelievable, was what happens when their young, attractive widow neighbor becomes pregnant. This is a woman who has been shunned by the ladies in the neighborhood because they didn't want her in their little clique, but suddenly is the focus of all their attention, to the point of obsession. It's unfathomable to me, that these women can be so insecure, in themselves and in their marriages, to be certain that it was one of their husbands who impregnated their nemesis.A good read if you have nothing else available, but definitely not one of Delinsky's best"
3,THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR,"The story of Barbara Delinksy's novel, The Woman Next Door, centers around the inhabitants of the four houses on a quiet cul-de-sac. There is Amanda and Graham who are desperately trying to having a baby which has made quite a strain on their marriage. There is Georgia and stay-at-home dad Russ while Georgia is running her own business. There is Karen and skirt-chasing Lee, which Karen tries to ignore his indiscretions. And the fourth house is occupied by a recently widowed young, beautiful woman, Gretchen. Life on the cul-de-sac is turned upside down when Gretchen turns up pregnant months after her husband died. Each of the other women on the cul-de-sac become very insecure when they learn of Gretchen's looming motherhood and wonder if their husband could be the father."
3,A bit slow paced,"This was my first Barbara Delinksy book and I have to say I wasn't terribly impressed. The back cover made the book sound as if it was going to be much more exciting that it actually was. Graham and Amanda's storyline got to be a bit monotonous, but it did give you an idea what childless couples go through trying to have a baby. However, this is not really my kind of book. It was a bit too slow paced for me though some people might really enjoy it as it deals with a lot of real to life issues. The father to Gretchen's baby was a bit of a disappointment too. I expected a more explosive ending. I gave this book three stars because it wasn't awful, but it wasn't really exciting either."
1,stupid and predictable,I read it until the end but it was a boring soap opera. I kept thinking it would get better but it didn't. Not even a good beach read.
3,"Quick Read, Good Story, but predictable","I have read all of Barbara Delinsky's books and have not been disappointed. The Women Next Door was a very good book and and a nice story. She addressed the emotions around trying to conceive a child extremely well. The story was nice, but the ending was predictable. I think she could have done more with some of the other charaters to make the story line a bit more intreging. I'd get this one from the library or wait for the paperback."
3,"As they say, 2 out of 3 ain't bad...","Music (thank you), Highfly (thank you). As a former midwest rock radio personality, I can honestly say I'm disappointed. One song that was most requested back in the 80's is missing in action - ""Where Would I Be Without You"". For that, I wouldn't recommend the expense in obtaining this."
1,Not as advertised,I have returned this item because the description indicated the fitted bottom sheet had elastic all around. When I received it there was elastic only on the corners. I am still waiting for my refund.
4,sateen sheets,"These were very nice. I thought they would be a little more sateen, but I am very happy with the quality."
1,Disappointed!,"A friend had order the 600-thread King sheet set which felt soft and looked great. I have a queen bed and therefore order this set. It is a twilled material; which I've never seen used for sheets. It is heavy, wrinkles when dried and isn't soft at all. I wouldn't recommend these product to anyone!"
1,POOR!!!,Don't waste your money. Sheets arrived with a small stain and the sewing quality was horrible. All the hems were uneven and you could see where the fabric was not cut straight!
2,Pills ruined the softness,"these sheets are very thick, and were nice for the first few weeks. however, the bottom sheet has developed ""pills"" which are uncomfortable, and the sheet is no longer smooth and soft. disappointing."
3,Of Roses And Pearls,"Everyone has said it, this tries to adhere to Janis Joplin's career (in which it is mildly successful) and personal demons (in which, mostly, it fails miserably). There's the loudmouth all guns bursting energy. But not even the songs are Blues glittering, as in Janis case,Now, if you forget all this baggage, the film is quite a tour-de-force for Bette Midler in her cinematic debut, but already the showbiz pro every inch of the way. The 3rd star is for her sake alone and maybe for the memory of Janis here and there. Script, dialogues, direction(?) are flirting with 2 stars."
3,It's the song that makes the movie,"I watched this movie because I was curious about the song of the same name featured in it. Amanda McBroom has composed a song that is positively brilliant for its simple poignancy. It is a joy to use this song as a teaching tool. I have taught English in Chinese and Japanese universities - and in both countries (China in particular) the song was received very enthusiastically. For the song alone the creators of this movie have left a wonderful legacy. But I must say the actual story was nothing special - just a typically uninspired romp through the predictable miseries of show business ""success."" As song, however, ""The Rose"" is gleaming jade in a pile of gray pebbles."
1,awful movie,"Movie was not what I had hoped it would be. I really like Bette Midler but she was horrible in this film. Wish I hadn't wasted my money but, ""you never know"".Only good song was ""The Rose"".Glad she's improved her acting over time.Disliked the story ,too.I'm no movie critic but hey, ""thumbs down"" on this one.The Rose"
1,Not described correctly,"Not described as ""full"" or ""wide"" screen on line. 2 copies I purchased were ""wide"" screen and I returned them very unhappy as I really wanted the movie and 1 for a gift."
1,Another one...,"... to pollute your garbage (shortage is not coming).If you want 'when a man wants a woman', you first have to make sure 'he' s a man and 'she's a woman. From what I saw (and heard) before this was put where it belonged (in the garbage), i'm not quite sure this had anything related to Janis joplin (if it is, i'm very sorry for her). If it had, i'm sure that everyone involved with this crap wanted every viewer despising her."
4,Classic Music and Concert Footage,"I saw this in 79 I guess when it hit the theatres on its first run.....I got the DVD on a whim and just finished watching it for the second time. My thoughts:Bette turns in a fantastic performance............I guess this was her first film and what a debut!I saw Janis Joplin at concert once and Bette does a pretty good job of channeling her.................I may be biased, but Janis sang much better.Alan Bates is just terrific as her manager.........this guy is good in everything I have seen him in.The movie needed more Harry Dean Stanton..............what an actor!...in his short time on the screen as the country singer/songwriter Billy Ray he sure makes an impact.The concert footage is amazing..................only a film like Last Waltz which is a real concert documentary surpasses The Rose.The music is great!!! Very nostalgic for me.My only quibble is it loses some pace before the final concert............overall I recommend this film highly."
5,Bette Midler at her best!,"For my money, this was Bette Midler at her very best, although she went on from here and starred in several other blockbuster movies. Very, very talented woman!"
3,Midler dazzles.,"The Rose starring Bette Midler in her feature film debut is a good film but not brilliant. Midler is the best thing in this film, The Rose is loosely-based on the life on Janis Joplin. Midler gives an intense and courageous performance. That beautiful song, The Rose still gives me chills, amazing! The ending is so sudden and sad, if you are a die-hard Bette fan then give this musical/drama a run through, enjoy!"
4,Leaving off one star due to the directores missteps,"Pure, powerful, raw, intense and unforgettable. This movie really is all those. Bette Midler took a role that legally had to change it's main characterization and managed to give that years best (yes, even over Sally Field) performance. She is thee reason to watch and though the time period should have been more defined it still gives a sense of how music was changing to the corporate [stuff] we now have before us."
2,damaged,"when i orederd this, it was for my mother in law, did not say is was damaged and in bad shape,"
5,The Rose,"I had looked for this movie locally for some time. I am REALLY glad that I found it on Amazon. The movie is excellent, it was delivered timely, and as always, the service from Amazon was great!"
5,VHS The Rose,"Altho it was older than I expected it played almost perfect, so I am semi pleased. Thank you seller...it arrived and was packaged nicely. Thanks again."
5,Extra Special,I was extremely pleased with this choice of Bette Midler's work. She performed well in this role!
5,Excellent !!,The Divine Miss M rocks in this classic movie. Great acting and great music to go with the movie.
1,Out of date,Unfortunatley times have changed since this book was made and this guide wansn't useful on our trip concerning where to eat and to go out in the evening and night. It was obviously very out of date.
3,Good informational book for those in the Medical Profession,"This is more a beginners guide to Reiki in the Medical Profession than anything else. Many of the ideas of where Reiki is from are outdated. Though for the most part the information is based on the Reiki tradition.I was disappointed by the lack of in-depth techniques and information on HOW to apply Reiki in these situations. This is a ""What is Reiki"" and ""How Reiki can benefit your profession"" book. A beginners information guide again. Good for it's purpose.The one thing I was upset by was the complete lack of discussion on the Ethics in Reiki. Even going so far as to tell people to do Reiki on people before asking permission. To me, a Reiki/Seichim Teacher the Ethics are some of the most important information to pass on."
3,"If you are attracted to this book, buy it.","This book is an easy read. It is not a detailed instruction manual on Reiki, in fact it doesn't give too much information away at all. The book talks about what Reiki is and, what surprised me, is how much the practice is utilized in human medicine, hospice etc... I had no idea how main stream the practice has become. The book packed with anecdotal support for the healing benefits of Reiki. The contents are well organized and she makes her points quickly. I picked up the book because I was taking Libby Barnett's Reiki level 1 and 2 courses and wanted to familiarize myself with her and her book. If you need further convincing that Reiki has a place in human medicine and supportive care pick up this book. After taking her course I'll be using Reiki on my small animal patients."
2,Another FAD book,I was sold on Reiki by an acquaintance -- so got all gung ho & ordered this book -- that she recommended. Found Reiki is just a lazy masseur's massage -- when a massage is sooooo much better.
5,Light Strategy & Fun for Adults too!,"I have been a long time Gamewright fan. This game is a prime example why they are so good. Good light strategy game makes it fun for kids of all ages. My 6yrs old was able to play it with only a few guidance along the way. This game has enough strategy to get adults playing and enjoy the whole process. By giving you the options of advance rules, the adults can further the playability of this game. You can even attack others. One of my favorites from Gamewright right now."
3,Quite Simplistic,"This game is a lot simpler than I expected it to be. It's almost tic-tac-toe like. I played it a few times and was pretty underwhelmed. I think it has potential for younger kids who want to play something strategic, but older kids/adults will probably be bored after a little while."
3,A bit slow,Our 8 year olds found this game a bit slow moving. Takes a bit of patience to get it going.
2,Mediocre playing,"This set includes a DVD and a bonus CD. The audio (stereo)and the video are good, but the conducting on the DVD is uninspired (it is a little better on the CD); so that they are more suitable as background music than as a concert."
3,It was a pretty good book.,"This was a good book. Not great, but definitely worth reading. It always keeps you on edge. It's one of those books were you can predict what is going to happen, but not when. Leona Blair is definitely a good writer. The whole story of Ema's life is wonderfully written but again it was predictable. You know what she is going to do and how she is going to do it. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good romance with a little bit of mystery also."
5,Brillo takes its best product off the market,"Like the first reviewer, if I had known they would no longer be available, would have bought as many as I could find."
2,Fun to doodle on but won't wash out,"My 7 year old daughter had so much fun drawing on the bear. We even did it together. But the markers just will not wash all the way out. I followed the directions exactly and then again and again but the purple drawings are still there, much lighter but definitely still there. Only the green washed all the way out."
1,failure to communicate,"When I first received the order, I thought I had gotten the part I was looking for because the part ""appeared"" correct. But when I went to put it on a piece of 6 inch schedule 40 DWV PVC, it didn't fit.Too small. Bottom line, there's not enough information in the description. Maybe actual inside diameter dimension would be helpful."
1,Green Lights.....Fail,wow talk about junk... not green.....what not green and the item said HID Xenon- Kryton H4 Green Headlight Bulbs ... more like yellow/white
2,i dont notice any green,"it just looks like normal yellow lights, complete waste of money. there is no green color no matter how hard i try to see green."
2,"Good design but poor construction, wobbles a lot","This stock has a great design but the material it is made of is pretty cheap, after 2 games it starts to wobble a lot, it appears that the plastic is is made of starts to loosen in the joints, making it unstable and unfit to be used with a sling since it cannot support the weight of just the marker without the gas tank."
5,Christmas present,"This was a christmas present for my daughter. She was really excited to get it, so I was happy with that. We used it while we were opening presents cutting tags and such, it was great."
5,this was a replacement,purchased for my father-in-law after he lost his old one. i made sure to get the exact same one and he loves it.
5,15 YEARS AND COUNTING!,"My husband absolutely goes nuts with this and has been enjoying them for at least the past 15 years---maybe more---and I've purchased many. There are so many times when others will turn to him with the quick, ""You do have that little knife-thing with you?"" as everyone knows he carries it and what all it can do in various situations. I don't keep purchasing them because they break but, rather, because he continues to 'forget' that his has them in his pocket while traveling (the TSA must have a good collection by now!), or lets people/strangers borrow it (but then forgets to retrieve it). He claims he can't live without it (and so many around him depend upon him always having it) so, therefore, I ensure he always has one! GREAT product!"
4,Great knife for the price,"For the price, this is a great knife. The blade and tool selection is good. Some may think that the knife is borderline too heavy to carry everyday, but I think it is OK.The biggest disappointment with this knife for me is that it does not have the finish that I am used to seeing on a Swiss Army knife. Instead of the smooth red plastic with the inlay Swiss Army insignia, this knife's case is a textured red plastic with a stamped insignia. In my opinion, it feels and looks cheaper that what I have come to expect from Victorinox.Overall, the casing is of little concern to me. What's inside is most important, and this knife offers a lot for the money."
3,"good knife, but...","I am pleased with the knife. It has the same blade/tool selection as the super tinker, with one exception, the phillips screwdriver is replaced with a cork screw. However it does not have the ""signature"" smoothe red plastic housing with a metal ""swiss army"" insignia. Instead the case is a textured red plastic with a stamped-painted insignia. I miss the phillips screwdriver blade... instead this one has a cork screw. Other than that the knive itself is the usual excellent victoronox swiss army quality. I have carried the ""super tinker"" for several years and it is like my right hand."
3,Didn't Like the Matte Finish,"I didn't expect the matte finish to make it feel like a deep difference in quality but it does make the knife feel cheaper than my old one. The color doesn't glisten and the edges are see-through.Also missing the Philips head screwdriver more than I thought.It's good for the money but if it weren't so cheap I would return it. I live with my Swiss Army knife in my handbag and use it more than I expect. So I am aware of the difference in finish. I thought having a better grip would be good. Nostalgia wins out. Just doesn't look or feel like a Swiss Army knife.Good deal for the price. Can't quibble about that. If you are looking for a good pocket knife ""plus"" this is bang for your buck."
5,Great knife! As expected,I had a blue version of the same knife. This one is as a present for my farther. He haven't seen this but I think he'll like it. Good product!
5,Most useful tool I own,"I always have my Swiss Army knife. I use it as a screw driver, a nail clipper, to cut and to clean."
5,Swiss Army Knife,I purchased this knife for my sister who traveled to Africa on a research mission to save the black rhinos. She is very pleased with the quality of this item and was grateful for the very prompt delivery at the last minute before her departure.
2,Used item,"Can't believe Amazon itself selling used item marked as NEW. First of all, the little packaging was just simply taped at one end. Second, when I opened it, can see some dirts in it with too much lubricant oil."
1,worst product I have ever bought from Amazon LLC,"The knife is defective. I used it yesterday for the first time, to open a wine and the cockscrew ended up distorted and could not be put back. I have used many different swiss army knives, and this one does not look genuine. I'm very surprised that this product is sold by Amazon LLC. Really poor quality, doesn't worth a penny."
4,I haven't used it yet as it is now in my family disaster,I haven't used it yet as it is now in my family disaster kit. Looks hope it is. Reviews are good.
4,Good pocket knife,"Purchased for my daughter...very good knife for her. She loves the scissors. Would like to see the philips blade in-lieu of the corkscrew. The ""package carrying hook"" is laughable. The can openers on swiss army knives are one of the few that actually work. The textured red handle panels help keep the knife from inadvertently from slipping out of a pant pocket."
4,Amazing tool,"First Swiss Army Knife and I am very pleased! I did a lot of research on which one I wanted and this seemed to be the best one for the price. All of the tools serve their purpose in an efficient way. Some people complain of having a corkscrew as opposed to a phillips screwdriver, but you can use one of the blades to fit a screw (flat or phillips). Also, the corkscrew can probably be used in more ways than a screwdriver IMO. I like the matte finish as opposed to the shiny plastic finish. It doesn't have to be this shiny, glowing awesomeness (haha) in order to be effective. The tools are what's important, not the color or finish. Definitely worth the buy!"
3,Cheap version,"Get the real version, this economy version looks like a knock-off, not the quality expected for an ""original"". The problem is its off color matte and insignia.. looks cheap.Only a couple dollars more for the original red grip with inlaid victorinox emblem."
4,All in one,I have this in my purse. The blade is wonderful when I need it to cut fruit or to open mail. It's just something handy to have on you. The weight of this knife is not bad. Not too heavy but doesn't feel too light that it feels cheap.
4,Has almost everything I wanted...,"The Victorinox's knife are great, I fell in love with my father's about more than 20 years ago!...However, although there's almost every possible tool you can imagine it could be a little bit difficult to get a knife with only the tools you want/need. This is the reason why I dropped a star... This Climber was a close shot, but maybe I'll get the ""Mountaineer"" which has a Metal/Nail file, but both have the hook and the reamer which I don't need... maybe the extra tool will add some bulk to the Mountaineer and that's the reason I didn't get it first...I'm using this for leisure and short trips, it's good to carry at least one of this sometimes."
5,Just what you need,Perfect accessory for many many uses.Very Sharp knifes and great priceits slightly light colored from the one that i had from swiss but its still the same and cant complain much about the quality...
4,It is a nice gift to my friend,It was a good deal. The price is fair enough as a nice gift to your male friend. I also kept one for myself.
3,"Dream-like, moody, haunting, Russian Gay film","This is another of those gay films that evokes a mood rather than telling a cogent story. Overall it is somewhat depressing as the lives shown are somwhat bleak and the story told is almost entirely of the mind. The post industrial, wasteland settings bespeak the mood of the individuals and their states of mind. I would rate this movie in the ""murky middleground"", while not as bleak or exploitative as Boys in the Band, or Cruising, its also not as affirming and upbeat as Torchsong Trilogy or Beautiful Thing."
3,good but not great,"This is a good CD but it would be great if the vocals were not so ""I'm so sad and lonely"" The album is very high energy and the vocals seem slow and dreary, may be this is intentional but it seems misplaced. This music does have it's moments howerver, a few songs stand out but overall I would'nt recomend it. However, it is worth listening to for the few songs where the vocals scream with pain insted of wallowing in depression. The secret song at the end is the best one, it makes me wonder why it's not the first track, irony? For a first release this band shows promise. I hope they will make a better record in the future."
2,Caesar and Cleopatra...Leigh/Rains Version,This version of Caesar and Cleopatra is an historical farce. The talent of Leigh and Rains are wasted on this thing. At the start of the film when Leigh meets Caesar Leigh plays the role of Cleopatra as a whimsical/foolish/giddy girl. Outrageous. Good costumes for a period piece but when compared to the Claudette Colbert or Elizabeth Taylor verions this is a disgrace. Don't bother...you have been warned.
2,Definitly a disappointment,"I just recently became a Vivien Leigh fan after seeing her in great films. I picked this up at my public library, looking foward to see her again. When I put into my VCR and when this movie appeared at the screen, I must say I was terribly disappointed. Nothing like GWTW or Waterloo Bridge. Her version of Cleopatra was ofial. And Claude Rains also gave me a bad impression, since it was the first time I had ever seen him on screen. I fell asleep half way through the movie, and when I woke up, I intended to fall back asleep. It was a horrible waste to my Saturday evening. But you can't be totally harsh because Vivien Leigh was going through some tough times during the making of the movie. But i'd recommended Waterloo Bridge, or GWTW, or any other Vivien Leigh film, but not CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA."
4,Maltin got this one wrong,"This is a fine rendition of the delightful Shaw play. A little rough around the edges when it comes to the supporting cast, but very enjoyable. Shaw's Caesar is a man of self-doubt and good humor, a vivid counterpoint to the haughty, aristocratic Caesar of Shakespeare."
2,Shaw play,"The only way to enjoy this film is to think of it as a George Bernard Shaw play, which is what it is. It's wholly unrealistic and ahistorical. It's also quite boring at times. Leigh reminds one of Judy Garland in The Pirate two years later--going under, plagued by her demons, and overacting shamelessly. Rains is fine, as long as you think of Caesar as 5 foot three inches and wandering the desert alone, spouting often hammy lines. If you like the play, you'll no doubt appreciate the film. For most people, this is something to avoid. The Koreans, by the way, would do well to learn how to spell the actors' names and place them in the appropriate place on the box. The Korean subtitles can be turned off."
1,Just plain silly,"I had recently read a biography on Vivien Leigh which sparked my interest in seeing her work other than That Hamilton Woman and Gone With The Wind. I found the whole movie and the acting to be silly, cheezy, boring and can't for the life of me imagine Cleopatra being that silly little girl.Here's a movie I'm glad someone had the sense to remake, Now Elizabeth Taylor, there's a Cleopatra."
2,"ok reading, but the first 2 were much better","Its nice to see a more up to date edition in the Big Secrets series, but the latest one is not nearly as enjoyable as the earlier ones. The secrets in this one just aren't all that fascinating."
1,"Please, keep these secrets to yourself!!!","How would you like to know what boy scouts do on their camping trips? I didn't think so, but this book tells you anyway. From the stuff you don't care about knowing, to the stuff that you probably already know, this one's got it all, which isn't much. A terrible read. Do me a favor, pick up a book like ""One Flew Over The Cookoo's Nest"" by Ken Keasy, or ""The Choking Doberman and Other 'New' Urban Legends"" by Jan Harold Brunvard (Both available here), you'll have a much better time with them. And William Poundstone can do us all a favor by keeping all of his other ""big"" secrets to himself."
1,Biggest Secrets was a disappointment,"I had to read this book for a class I was taking and I found it to be boring, dull and insignificant. I believe it is a waste of paper."
3,Wierd Packaging,"This just arrived today. I will update my review after I actually use it.The company that sold this product is called ""Best Surgical Supplies"", and yet my item came wrapped in a crumpled piece of newsprint torn out of ""The Truck Paper"" (I guess someone is looking to buy a big rig?). Anyway, I found that odd and disconcerting.Off to dunk my new speculum in a pot of boiling water..."
4,PREVENTION,"This is an important item to have for health reasons. Even though you go to the doctor, it is important and up you to check yourself frequently and be aware of any problems..."
1,Shock and Awe,I bought this product along with a doctor's lab coat. I borrowed a stethiscope and wore all four to a Halloween party.I got two different reactions from the female attendees - most were shocked but a few were in awe!What a perfect way to cull out the herd!!!!!!!
3,Autoharp 15 chord,"Instrument in fair condition, might have been good to know it wasn't cleaned and case was so weathered, as it was given as a gift. Very grateful to have an autoharp that looked like it was enjoyed."
5,Classic,"This is the British ""Streetcar Named Desire."" Harris rock and rolls as an unforgiving animal rugger. His passion and rage will blow you away, plus lots o' good ruby scenes."
5,excellent book,"really made me take a second look at all of the dogs in my life. I also realized that I humanized my dog's emotions, when instead he was using his inherited language to calm me."
4,It opened my eyes to a whole new world,"This little book (and an accompanying video) opened my eyes to a new world (for me!!) I knew little of dog body language at the time, and most of what I had been told was erroneous. I use the ""calming signals"" knowledge routinely with my dogs, particularly because my Airedale, Border Terrier, and Blue Heeler live inside with me and can really cause chaos. I have learned to read what the dogs are saying to each other and to me. And it has motivated me to both read and study dog behavior -- a fascinating subject. This was the beginning of a better dog trainer and most importantly a much better dog owner."
5,Good things to know,I came away learning new things that I could put to use with my dog right away. I actually liked that this was not a really long book since I don't read very fast and I hate wasting hours reading unnecessary filler. It's fun to see my dog's response to the calming signals outlined in the book.
2,Not enough information,"The premise and intention are good, but just as the author gets into the practical application of calming techniques, the book ends. Sorry, not worth $8.48."
2,Okay,"I found the information of body language to be interesting, but limited. I was really expecting more information to make a difference with training and understanding dogs."
5,Very helpful for understanding man's best friend,"I found this book intriguing! It helps me be a better, more understanding friend to my dogs."
2,"Bought it, read it. Sure glad I bought others.","Not a bad 37 page pamphlet as far as it goes . . . which is not very far. It came in a shipment of four books on the topic of dog to human communication, all about the same price. It has proven to be the least helpful by far. Dog Language by Abrantes is much more complete, is over two hundred and fifty pages with a seven page bibliography (vs. a ten item listing in this one.) This book thoroughly covers one word of the dogs vocabulary with dozens of variations. The anecdotal information is interesting but I expected more."
1,So what do we do without an already calm dog to teach our dogs?,"I was hoping for more real world application than just ""look away"" or ""poke at the ground"" or ""yawn."" When my dog is staring down another dog the last thing she notices is me looking away or yawning. The only thing applicable was getting in between the two dogs to try to calm them.Every section of the book described how she used her already calm and communicative dog to rehabilitate other dogs. What do us readers without one of those do?? The book description should include a ""All methods require a calm and dog friendly dog to be effective."" I was hoping for advice and instructions on how to calm a dog not stories on how her dog has calmed other dogs. Those stories don't help in any way whatsoever.Also I wasn't thrilled about the 11 pages at the end of the book of advertisements and blank pages considering the entire book is only 85 pages with huge margins and half of it pictures."
3,just okay,"This book was pretty basic, but it did have some good information about certain postures and signals that dogs use that some people would not be aware of. Made more for the beginner than the advanced dog lover."
2,Ok,"Quality a bit dated an while interesting enough, not much to it. I thought there would be a bit more info or demonstration."
2,on talking terms with dogs -calming signals,Not worth the money - unless you fine it for about 2 bucks. If you have dogs it is things you will already know. There was maybe one thing I didn't know. It is very basic. Go to the library and read it for free. If they don't have it - don't bother.
3,Interesting but not very informational,This book has some interesting insight but does not provide much practical advice on how to use the signals. Plus it does not seem to give many varied views.
2,feeling guilty about this review,"so many good reviews- I dont know, this book was a no-brainer. I mean body language for dogs is simular to adults sort of. I was really surprised this book was like a brochure very thin -if it had more solutions than explainations Id found it helpful..maybe I was looking for a solutions based book instead and not a book about the language of dogs- I barked up the wrong tree on this one... wish I could say it was a good purchase but for me - it wasnt"
3,Good but cursory.,"This very short book is a decent introduction to stress behaviors of dogs, but it does not go into depth on how to use this knowledge to help a stressed dog. The most important suggestion of the book, I suppose, is to not be aggressive or violent toward your dog. If you are familiar with and utilize positive training practices but still find yourself with a nervous dog, this book may not be very helpful for you."
5,Great tools the everyday dog owner can use!,"This book is great! My breeder recommended it and it was such an easy read! Very straight forward and informative! I would recommend it to anyone who has a dog or works with dogs. I do both and it has made my life with not only my own dog but the dogs i work with as well so much more understandable. After reading this book, just go watch a pack of dogs interact. You will pick up on so much that you never noticed before! Overall, loved the book!"
5,So interesting,Fun little book! I'll be keeping this one close by to reference. This will certainly come in handy and make me more aware.
4,On Talking Terms ....Very helpful,"This was a good short book. I liked it because it stresses where a dog is coming from, which enables you to understand and provide a better bonding and training time with your new dog. Once you understand your pet, you can better train her. Your expectations will become more clear and realistic as well as an improvement in your dog's behavior."
2,Not that impressed,"After reading all of the rave reviews I think my expectations were too high. I was just not that impressed with this book and found the advise to be a bit vague; I would recommend reading any book by Patricia McConnell before this one.On a side note the author (and editor in not catching this) really irked me with her inability to spell the word losing correctly, it was mispelled at least 2x's; the correct spelling of losing is NOT ""loosing"" and loose and lose do NOT mean the same thing."
2,On Talking Terms with Dogs: Calming Signals,"The subject matter was interesting however it was more like a pamphlet than a book, but it had a book price! Buyer beware!"
4,Good if it's not your dog that's the problem,"I was hoping that reading this book would help me calm my dog down, but I don't feel that it had any useful information. It talks a lot about what to do if a dog approaches you, and how to use calming signals to get that dog to calm down. But it doesn't say what to do if a dog is approaching you and it's your own dog that needs calming, which is a totally different situation."
5,So Insightful; a MUST READ!,"I have a very close relationship with dogs, and have over the years developed a language of communication with the dogs I work with and own. I think sometimes we start thinking we know everything, so despite the other excellent reviews which ultimately behooved me to buy the book, I was doubtful that I would learn something new. Indeed, this woman has insight into some doggy signals that are definitely not the obvious ones we all know and recognize. The stories in the book, and her straightforward, simple approach really are astounding. I can't wait to see dogs interact so I can put this new knowledge to use! This is a DEFINITE ""MUST READ"" whether you are a brand new dog owner, or have been around dogs for years."
2,"Interesting but useless, from a practical sense","Interesting to understand dog behavior BUT she doesn't explain how to apply it to teaching your dog, she only explains how to watch for signs that you are overwhelming your dog. My dog ignores my yawning, licking, blinking and looking to the side. I guess if a strange dog attacks me I know to sit down with my back to it (yeah, sure). I'd love to attend her classes but this book is NOT worth owning. Borrow it and read it."
3,A simplistic voice for dogs,"This book and the DVD was recommended to me by a dog trainer/whisperer who said she thought it was the best thing she'd seen for dogs. My overall impression, after reading it and watching the disc is that this trainer is ""on to something"" but hasn't really got it all worked out yet. She puts Calming Signals forth as a way of understanding dog body language, but is everything about ""anxiety"" for dogs? Isn't the occasional yawn just a yawn? Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar as another interpreter once admitted and I have a hard time believing everything is broken down into this simplistic, if occasionally useful, dichotomy of ""anxiety/calm"". I think there's more to dogs."
2,Less than I expected,"The material was presented in an anecdotal style. It was not presented in a manner that evidenced a unifying underlying understanding of behavior. I did find pieces of the book to be helpful, and I have no doubt that the author has extensive experience and great skill working with dogs. However the information was presented in what seemed like a piecemeal fashion and did not have evidence based or objective material to support the authors own opinions."
4,Helpful short read. Helpful photos.,"This is an excellent brief book for anyone concerned and trying to anticipate the behavior of their - or other- dogs. Is the approaching dog friendly or not, and how does your dog feel about that dog? Good photos - helpful."
2,Try a video instead,"From recognitions the author has received and positive reviews here--I bought the e-book. However, please consider a DVD instead. She laid a foundation but never built it up. A 10-year old might appreciate it. For 15 minutes of reading...I did not get my money value."
2,30?,"The signals are interesting and the pictures illustrate the behaviors well, but the book as a whole is poorly organized and provides very little context. The sections just seem to bump into one another. Almost all of the signals are described as having the same effect or purpose. To be fair I suppose that's the point of the book: calming. But really that's just too thin a topic without going into more detail on each behavior. There must be some difference between licking and curving, for example. What is it? I believe she also claims there are 30 signals, but only discusses about 13."
4,I wish my dogs would read this book :),"I think this book offers a lot of good advice. Unfortunately, when I need to tell my dogs to calm down, they are inevitably not looking at me to see my ""calming signals"". I do wish that we could meet with another dog that knows the language well enough to teach it to my dogs. When I was out on a walk this weekend, my dog rushed over to try to meet a much smaller dog who was out on a walk. This dog immediately laid down to try to get her to calm down, but she kept on straining against her leash. I was forced to just tug her along with me. I guess I just haven't yet figured out how to teach her to talk to other dogs yet. I will probably re-read this book and try to figure it out better."
2,What does dog training have to do with movie and TV stars,"This book is about Milan, not dog training. I'm happy for him, as he's hit it big. However, I didn't purchase the book to learn about his life. I wanted real advice and I wanted it to be good advice. It wasn't either one. I was told by a dog trainer, to throw the book away and buy some other books. I bought them, followed the advice and my dogs and I are now much happier now. My advice is to buy books written by dog lovers, not movie star lovers with problem dogs."
2,Very basic but might be good for novice.,"I bought this book with high hoops. I have over 20 year experience working with dogs and trying to understand them. Due to that experience, I find this book worthless to me.The information is very novice and I already known majority of it. I have to admit that I agree with most of the signals that the author wrote but already known the meaning.I think it as well has a okay part about puppy training but does not go deep enough. t states be nice and positive which is good. It not good to punishal physical with a puppy. That is right as well. The puppy should be reward for correct behavior.The issue that is should mention the puppy should be socialized in new places while watching the puppies communication.If you known dogs well and understand them, a bad book but if your someone novice probably a good book."
4,Worth Reading,"It's exciting to see more books on understanding animal language becoming so popular. This one reminds me of another favorite, ""Adam's Task: Calling Animals by Name,"" by Vicki Hearne, which also focuses on really understanding your pet. It combines animal training with philosophy and literary criticism. The Atlantic Monthly called it ""A fascinating and often surprising discussion of animal-human encounters."" If you are an animal trainer-- or even just an animal lover-- it's definitely worth checking out."
1,disappointed,I was very disappointed in this book. I expected to learn much much more. There was no depth or insight in this book.
5,Multiple Staff Ministries By by Kenneth R. Mitchell,This book is an excelent way to understand the workings of a church and its people
3,Not comprehensive enough to pass the workstation exam,"This book doesn't even hit all the basics. The most noticable shortfall is a total lack of printer coverage, which is hit hard on the workstation exam."
4,Good for core exams.,Bit expensive book but gives you a overview for both the MCP Workstation 4.0 and Server 4.0 exams. Has great practice involved with book. Would recommend it as a 2nd book for those leaning to certification or just to learn NT.
1,Sorry,I did not realize what I was purchasing when I did. I did not take the time to read what the item was. So I made a huge mistake.
3,Urban Ghost Story,"If your looking into getting this movie because you are a devout Billy Boyd fan....BE WARNED: this is a different kind of Billy character. He plays the son of a loan shark and there is bad language involved. Not his most lovable part. He's also not on the screen as much as a true Billy Boyd fan would like.On the positive side, this is an interesting movie with a interestingly scary plot and good acting. I would recommend it to anyone, who likes a good scary story."
3,Not like Picture or Original,"This filter bears no resemblance to the original in my Bionaire, except for dimensions. It is much flimsier. Nor does it match Amazon's image. Nevertheless there aren't a lot of choices."
5,"No ""Psycho-babble"" Spoken Here!",I've read a ton of books on sales but none are like Simple Selling! It's straight to the point and right on target. Anyone in the sales or customer service field must add this one to their shopping cart!
5,A MUST for anyone in the sales field!,This book is a must for anyone in sales. Quick and easy to read. Full of common sense tips that work! I highly recommend!
5,Simple Selling: Common sense that guarantees your success.,"According to Thomas Ray Crowel, selling doesn't have to be so complicated. In his book, ""Simple Selling"", Crowel offers his fellow salespeople a ""a new perspective on a very old profession."" Crowel explains, ""The selling process consists of many things, some of which can be taught, and some which can't."" However, sales success is not as unattainable as many may believe. Crowel's straightforward book serves up a wealth of practical sales tips and career guidance. Tapping into real-life examples from his own lenghty sales career, Crowel presents truly simple selling methods that could be valuable to both sales rookies and hardened veterans."
1,Tom Crowel has a Simple Mind!,"Who does this guy think he is kidding? Tom Crowel sells insurance to lower middle class people in Indiana and washes the used cars they drive, and he thinks he is Donald Trump. This book is simple, because the author is. His story of a ""humble childhood"" I'm not buying, and neither should you. Old insurance men are usually cheats personally and in business, and boy does he fit the stereotype from reading this GARBAGE!"
4,Simple Selling - Common Sense That Guarantees Your Success,"Selling is a skill, and is learned. The average salesperson never goes to a seminar, nor reads a book on selling. That's why the average are average. Thomas Ray Crowel's book is simple, but shares the basics of selling. Deep down we all know what it takes, but it takes someone who can make it easy to understand to clarify it. Tom's book does just that. I'm glad the book is in my library so that I can pick it up and review it often. If you're in sales, you have to keep improving and learning. Learning is the competitive edge. There's no money paid for coming in second."
1,For the simple minded,"The author of this book hit the nail on the head with the word simple in the title. This book is simple indeed. The book is for your average third grader trying to sell a school fundraiser. This book is very easy to read, too bad the only pictures in it are of the old man who wrote it. How many trees had to die for this? What a waste!"
2,Repulsive,"This film was disgusting compared to tom greens usual stunts. He sunk to a new low with this one. Im not even going to say what he did in this movie. The plot was horrible for the most part, the acting stunk and its filled with purposless sick antics. I know thats tom green but tom sunk to a new low to be funny. The majority of the movie wasnt funny only reason im giving it 2 stars is cause there was 2 or 3 parts out of the whole movie which gave me a laugh. Dont buy this movie unless your a tom green fanatic! Please rent then decide. Overall 1.5 stars."
5,This will be a great DVD for any Tom Green fan!!,It's an all out HILARIOUS movie! Tom Green plays Gord Brody who is a bum that lives in his Parent's basement and dreams of being an Animator. Although it doesn't have a great plot I still think it was great. I saw it in the theaters and it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. My face hurt from laughing so much when it was over. If you like Tom Green you will enjoy this movie as much as I did. For anyone that doesn't like gross out comedy or you're like a certain reviewer who only gives good reviews to little princess stories this isn't for you. This DVD hopefully will include any deleted senes and also commentary. I hope you enjoy the movie:)
1,NEGATIVE 5 STARS!,THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST MOVIE I SEEN IN THE PAST 10 YEARS!!!i usually like tom greens stuff but this was a total let down. its not just what happens in the movie but the way it happens in a very pointless way. such as when his buddy breaks his leg and tom is licking the broken part of his leg. and dont forget the swinging of the baby and wearing the deer. the constant idiotic attitude gets old fast too. i usually find the most strangest things humerous but me and 10 of my friends found this to be one of the stupidest movies ever. dont waste your mony on this garbage. would be better suited as a coffee table coaster. heck dont even rent it.
3,Daddy would you like some sausage?,"This movie makes no claim at being anything more that it is...pure madness from Tom Green. The guy is funny and definitely creative and unique. There were parts where I shook my head and there were parts where I laughed. With that being said, leave your intelligence behind for 90 minutes and have some fun. Sure it's a bad movie but sometimes I'm a sucker for this stuff. I've got to go now. I think I hear my kitch.... er cell phone ringing. Enjoy."
2,"I'm glad I rented this first, I feel like= I got fingered!","For instance, every good ""funny scene"" was in the ""deleted scenes"" area such as: the cheese helmet (I restarted the movie 4 times to see the heavily advertised cheese factory scene but I did not see it), the gutting of the elk, sucking the cow, the herbal cigarette scene.. And there were other scenes that would of helped the movie make sence to us like the scenes with his uncle- who is coupled up with an indian chief & the manager of the cheese factory, The delta force suit scene where Tom uses a special laser gun to open his own parents front door-- And another cut scene in which Rip Torn has the handle & lock changed, during that the cop offers to ""take out"" Tom. Do not get the DVD, Get the VHS version which should have evey scene from what my sister told me. You will be the one ""fingered"" if you rent or buy the DVD version!! : \"
1,...ONLY because of no NO STAR rating!,"My friend showed me this nasty movie! I could barely watch it, and I (and most of my friends) demanded it be shut off within like 20 minutes (around the time the baby was born). Had I seen this movie in the theater, rest assured it would've been the first movie I would've EVER walked out on in the first half-hour, plus I'd only ask for Tom Green's share of the ticket back if I could...."
1,OH GOD,If you saw this film.. You should sue Tom Green for PTSD....God this thing is badThe only good part was when Green was ran over by the truck...!!!!! And even THAT was way too short...Green should be tried for crimes against good taste And still breathing after making this ...If there is a Hell for bad taste.. Green will be there
1,Revenge of the Non-Cinema!,"Each year, a wealth of celluloid sludge is dumped upon the moviegoing public. How ""Freddy Got Fingered"" made it to theaters in 2001 will remain one of life's eternal mysteries. Did the MPAA actually watch this garbage? Despite an inexplicable cult following, the terminally curious should avoid Tom Green's pathetic journey into the realm of non-cinema. Perhaps it is time for Amazon to create a zero-star rating."
1,This Movie Doesn't Even Deserve 1 Star,"Only get this movie if you're a fan of Tom Green. I made the fatal mistake of buying this piece of crap, and I hate myself for doing so."
1,Deservedly won 5 Razzies,Truly can be admitted to the pantheon of the Worst Movies Ever Made. All you have to do is watch the scene where Rip Torn drops his pants ... and you'll want to know what [person] green-lighted this piece of trash. It's a shame I can't give this floatsam no stars!
1,This movie was the worst piece of (...) I have ever seen.,"This movie deserves at least negative 3 stars. It is a shame that Amazon's rating system cannot truely rate how bad this movie was. As a matter of fact the English language does not have a word that describes just how bad this movie is.Why was this movie bad? First of all, this movie had no plot whatsoever. At best, it was a string of very base jokes that were not funny at all. (i.e. Tom Green should seek help for his fixation with animal penises.) I could mind the lack of plot if the movie was funny - - but it was not.Tom Green deserves to be kicked in the (...) for making a piece of (...)like this."
1,Terrible,"I would not waste your time watching this movie, unless you are a huge Tom Green fan. There is no real plot and the movie is not that funny. The only humour in the film comes from what the main character does - not what he say's. What he does for the most part is just sickening. Have to agree with other reviews and recommend you dont waste your time ..."
1,Rambling Incoherence,"This is the worst movie that I have ever seen, and gives a new definition of the word stupid, geez I though half baked and battlefield earth were bad. This movie is complete bulls__t and will only make you angry at at yourself for have watched it."
1,"STUPID,STUPID,STUPID....","THE WORST MOVIE I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME!! DISGUSTING,BORING,IRRITATING AND A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!! SHOULD BE BURNED AND NEVER TO TAKE UP SPACE ON A SHELF EVER AGAIN!! BOTTOM OF THE HEAP!!"
3,HA! HA!...I guess.,"Conterverisal or stupid? Maybe both. I think by now everbody knows what to expect before they see this movie. Tom Green whacking off a horse, swinging a baby by its umbilical cord, slicing open a dead deer and so on. If you think these things can be made funny, then you will enjoy this. If not then back away for the DVD. Personally, I was caught between being slightly offended to laughing out loud. In the end this is a very funny movie when its not being retarded or shocking. I do think Tom Green can do better and I will be in the ticket line when he does. LOOK AT ME!! I'M A FARMER!!!!!!"
4,Green is a sick ...,I have been a tom green show fan for about 4 years now. (Including his Candian show wich i saw on something smells funny and tonsil hockey) I had been looking foward to seeing this movie for a while. So the opening weekend my dad took me and IT WAS GREAT! There's is no more little cam corder movements in this film like the tv show. i think tom green does a great job.... on everything!! But still..... why did he ... ...?
3,I don't know if i like it or hated it,"This movie is whacked, but it kept you watchin..lol. What sick (...) was going to happen next. Some of the scenes were funnier than (...)and others...were plain sick....NOTE* weak stomached people...when you get to the pregnate lady in the hospital scene..fast forward it. That is the worst part of the movie. you can get past it..your home free. This movie is whacked...but at the end there was an actual point to the thing. And a good one at that....which after watching the whole thing....I didn't know what to think...I was just in shock...lol.The only thing I can tell you..is you have to watch at least once. Even sitting here now..I just don't know about it....it's not for everyone thats for sure. it just one of those things that at the end of it you just ""hmmmm"" It will leave you with mixed emotions...lol."
2,Freddy Got Fingered,"This Movie Lacked Enthusiasm Of Any Good Actors, Some Parts Funny But not a good choice if you're looking to purchase a movie. However tom green is a very good actor in this movie I still only give it two stars because it has a horrible story AND WAS NOT VERY ""BRILLIANT"" (see bottom of movie case)"
1,Tedious,"Nearly impossible to finish. Inane non-humor. If you have a room temperature IQ, you'll love it."
1,I laughed 'til I cried.....NOT!!!,I cried all right (tears of joy when it ended). This movie really sucked that bad. Nothing Tom Green does in this movie is funny. In fact it made me want to smash my head in to end the pain. You'ld have to be really drunk or really high to enjoy this one. Don't spend a dime on this one.
3,Freddy Got Fingered,"Funny movie, a little annoying on a few parts. Definitely have to have a bit of a strange humor side to you. Tom Green delivers in this film with his crazy antics."
1,Tom Green= Idiot,"Remember when the main criteria of a comedy film was that it had to be funny?Tom Green doesn't.This film is proof that the human race is de-evolving, we will all be tree climbing, crap thowing apes in the not too distant future. Thank you Hollywood for speeding up the process."
1,Unfunny trash.,"Tom Green is unfunny, immature, and washed up. Any sort of 'talent' he has had has long gone down the drain years ago.Do yourself a favor and dont watch this movie.This movie actually made me feel dumber every second i watched it and it felt like my brain cells were slowly being fried. Stay away from this pathetic excuse of a funny movie!"
1,Freddy Got Fingered,"By far the worst movie I have ever seen, and I am a high school student, the target audience! I came out of the theater dumber then when I went in."
1,"If I could give it a negative 5, I would...","This movie was just about the worst movie I ever saw... so utterly and painfully pointless, and not the slightest bit funny. Tom Green makes a complete fool of himeself. I actually turned off the movie half-way through because it was so stupid... Don't waste your time or money on this one!"
4,disgusting humor,I'm not going to lie. I was laughing the whole movie yet there was still many scenes that were outright disgusting. I would not recommend this to young kids and to adults who cant handle ronchy humor that's been taking to the next level. But if comedy is your thing and you dont mind Tom Green I would recommend this movie and be prepared to laugh at things you never thought you'd think was funny.
5,ok,what was i thinking when i wrote my first review. im a big fan of tom green and have been since road trip. its hilarious but you have to cancel your brain out of it. if your willing for a dumb but hilarious film rent this or the little better a night at the roxbury. ok so who did tom play in superstar. i hated dat flick. the jokes are priceless. the humors gross. its fun though if not dark.
3,What a disguting movie!,"I will start by saying this movie is very disgusting. The majority of the gags in the movie rely on grossout humor. But that isn't to say it's not funny, it's just that some of the stuff was rather unsettling. The main things that bugged me were all of things that were being done to the animals.I can tolerate grossout humor, but only to an extent. And I felt that they went a bit too over the top with it. I have watched the Tom Green show so I kind of had a rough idea what to expect from it, And if you are a fan of the Tom Green show then you probably wont have any probelm with this movie."
1,Made me feel like I was fingered,"I walked out of the theater and demanded my money back halfway through this garbage. While I do enjoy sick humor, this was done so poorly, I couldn't even laugh. When I descibe scenes from this movie to others, I actually get a chuckle from the stupidity of the scenerios. Yet, when all put together, I got no enjoyment from it and got dirty chills up my spine watching Tom Green pleasure a horse. I went to see this because I got a kick in the previews as Tom played the piano with the sausage contraption, but I couldn't even watch it long enough to get to that part. There is a great scene from a Family Guy episode where Tom Green is under a cow in a ballerina outfit, sucking on the cow's utter. He says something like ""Do you like me yet? Can I stop this now!?"" That is what I think about Tom Green. That makes me laugh."
3,Freddy's got it!,"The modern version of a ""screwball comedy"", ya gotta laugh, if only because Green's sense of humour can be so bizarre.I've never been a Tom Green fan, but I'm a fan of Freddy. It doesn't click on all cylinders, but when it does you'll howl. A definite thumbs up for bizzarro excellanto.The title itself is derived from one of the quirky twists of the movie. Most likely, it's not what you expect..."
5,beer and brain cells,"You probably won't like this movie but I did. Most people won't let themselves enjoy such shallow movies because they think it will make them dumber and lose brain cells. So does drinking alcohol, but everyone still does that. There is actually a story and a real plot to this movie with a bunch of crazy things that happen along the way that should have you laughing your a$$ off or turning your head. So grab a beer, sit back and watch this movie and see how fast you can ruin your brain."
2,What the Hell?,What happened to the clever maniac who was raising Hell at the Bingo party and who spread dog crap on microphones?That was the Tom Green whose show I used to stay up for every Friday night but this movie is just a waste of time.The only really cool thing about it was the road kill scene.This movie sucked.I still miss his TV show though.
2,"Dumb and Amateur, But Sometimes Funny","Tom Green's Freddy Got Fingered, which he wrote, directed, and stars in, is not very good work. What makes us laugh, though, is how stupid Tom Green is, from ""getting inside"" a moose, to playing with a horse's...you guessed it. I was definitely laughing at times, but overall the acting was pretty bad and the whole idea was so dumb. Maybe you could rent it for a good laugh, but don't buy the DVD unless you're a big fan!"
5,Don't believe the bad press,"I think this deserves to be reviewed again after 10 years. I believe it will be understood more over time and become a classic of the cinema. If you haven't seen it, wait until you have some time to watch it twice, because when it's over, you'll want to see it again."
1,If You Want To Get Sick...See This Movie,"I MEAN REALLY. WHY WAS THIS MOVIE EVER MADE IN THE FIRST PLACE???THAT'S JUST ONE OF MY QUESTIONS. ANOTHER ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS:WHY DID THIS MOVIE RECIEVE AN ""R"" RATING? THIS SOULD'VE BEEN RATED ""NC-17"". BECAUSE IT CONTAINS GROSS-OUT HUMOUR FROM BEGINNING TO END. ONLY WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOUR A BIG TOM GREEN FAN. SEATTLE TIMES SAID THIS MOVIE HAD ""SOME OF THE FUNNIEST SCENES IN MEMORY""... WELL IMHO SEATTLE TIMES ARE A BUNCH OF M-O-R-O-N-S, MORONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID THE DIRECTOR BRIBE THEM TO SAY THAT!!! HE MUST'VE BECAUSE NOTHING IN THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY.. JUST DISGUSTING... WITH A CAPITAL ""D""!!! BUT THIS MOVE WILL MAKE GREAT FIREWOOD!!!!!!!!"
1,Huh?,"""Freddy Got Fingered"" is one of the worst movies released on 2001. This was well-deserved of all five Golden Raspberry awards, including Worst Picture. Most of the screenplay and events don't make sense and do not fit. Most of the ""humor"" isn't funny, it's just immature nonsense. One that is familiar with MTV may expect Tom Green to be as funny as on ""The Tom Green Show"". He doesn't come close. Those who are looking for a quality comedy, stay far away from ""Freddy Got Fingered""."
1,HORRIBLE!,Nothing was good about it. It was just bad. It [stunk]. I can't say anthing else about it. We rented it from [a local store] a few days ago and I watched it and it was messed up. If you watch it you'll be sorry.
1,Worse than stupid,"This movie is stupid and boring. I have enjoyed Tom Green in most of his tv appearances, but this movie is not worth viewing. The jokes are not funny, it isn't even a ""dumb"" kind of funny. There are also some vulgar scenes that are present for no apparent reason and fail to bring laughter. Pass on this one."
1,Putrid,"A worthless movie by a talentless, vulgar moron. Would give it zero stars if I could. Belongs on the trash heap along with the 'spoof' movies."
1,When will Tom Green get sick of being a disgusting idiot?,"Tom Green needs to grow up. Or at least make a movie that won't make somebody puke. This was a horrible, sacreligious, DISGUSTING movie. (...)Tom Green believes that being disgusting is funny. Sometimes it is, but not in this case. Get a life, Tom."
1,Attention Mr. Green...,...your fifteen minutes of fame are now over. Please report to Obscurity Division and take a number for possible participation in Fox Celebrity Boxing. Thank you.
1,Huh?!?,"I like Tom Green. His off-the-wall sense of humor is definitely something that I can appreciate on a twisted, wierd, slapsticky kind of way. But, when I saw this movie, all I can think of through the first half and hour of this film is that, ""He's trying too hard to be funny."" The first time I saw this movie, I could only stomach an hour of it. So, just to be fair, I watched it again. I had no change of heart. I think that this movie tried to push the envelope of being raunchy and humorous and lost a lot. It was a half-baked plot with below average acting. This was one of those movies that if you watched it, afterwards you would probably say something like ""I knew I should've bought Solo or Amadeus or something like that. Anything but this."" In the words of his miniscule role in Charlie's Angels, ""It's the Chad"", and a piece of garbage to boot. Save your money. Buy Rocky IV or something. That's funnier than this lazy movie."
1,This is a horrible movie,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. I am even a Tom Green fan so I went in with an open mind expecting Greene's ususal antics. This movie is so unfunny I wanted to turn it off less than thirty minutes after the opening credit. Don't waste an hour and a half of your life on this piece of garbage.
5,Hilarious!,"ok this isn't much of a review but neither is the review from A VIEWER FROM ANTARCTICA . I think it is really stupid that you put your personal issues about tom green in your review. That is wrong what you said about if he has a blood disease that you hope he dies. Didn't anyone ever tell you not to say stuff like that, that it might happen to someone you love or care about? Besides what do you think? That tom green will see your review? Come on he has better things to do. As for this movie, I think it's nothing different from road trip or the tom green show. What don't you have a sense of humor ? Are you just one of those people who are too serious? Take my advice GROW UP, GET A LIFE AND A SENSE OF HUMOR, KEEP YOU THOUGHTS TO YOURSELF . NO ONE CARES."
4,Underappreciated gem,"This movie gets too much slack. It's a very funny, irreverant movie. There are several scenes that nearly left me in tears they were so funny. Rip Torn is hilarious."
1,Should be on the list of worst movies of all time,"I would give this -5 stars. After sitting through about 20 minutes, I gave up on seeing anything remotely entertaining."
4,"I couldn't stop watching, I couldn't stop laughing","Yes, it's stupid, yes it will very likely offend you, but darned if I wasn't laughing till my sides hurt as I watched Tom Green do one shocking & mindless thing after another. Betty, his girlfriend, was such a hoot, and Rip Torn as Green's dad proved his greatness. I especially love the scene where he pulls down his pants and bears his buttocks. You have to see it to believe it! Actually, most of this movie has to be seen to be believed, since it's so ludicrous that writing about it you'd think it was some psychotic fantasy, which it is, but it's just not mine. Money talks, so Tom Green was allowed to indulge his insane whims, while I can't. No fair!"
5,The best comedy of the 21st century!!!!,"This movie is AWESOME!! Whenever I'm feeling tired, sad or stressed out all I have to do is think of this movie to raise my mood. I've probably watched this movie well over 100 times and I still consider it to be a hilarious movie. Whoever is posting these comments about this movie being stupid and a bunch of nonsense probably has no sense of humor or is looking for your typical comedy. I love ""stupid funny"" movies and this is by far my favorite. Tom Green is sensational and puts on an act that no other comedian can even come close to. When I move to California this year I'm going to work in the CHEESE SANDWICH FACTORY DADDY!!!!"
1,Can a movie really be any worse?,"Good Zeus in Heaven, please hit Tom with a lightning bolt before he makes another movie. Sure, I can sympathize that [he] got testicular cancer and showed the world his surgery, but enough brownie points. At this point I expect Tom to make a movie that is A) amusing B) interesting rather than a movie where he plays sick horse and elephant mating games. Tom, go find a new career....."
1,Freddy Got Fingered,"Sometimes I think Tom Green is funny, like when he took Monica Lewinski with his parents around Quebec. Or when he went across Puget Sound. But this movie is really disgusting and terrible. Usually I like sick humor but this wasnt humor because I didnt feel it was original. I know I'm a nerd, but I do know a good movie when I see one. Like Election take for example. Their was sick things in that movie, but the begginning and towards the end were fantastic. This movie was bad from the begginning to the end. I don't like to ruin the movie so I don't tell what it's about like most people."
3,Crazy movie,"This movie is not for everyone, it's more like a crazy movie going from one extreme to the other but at the end Tom Green delivers a very good performance and i recommend to see this one only once and you will never forget it."
2,Freddy ain't funny,"People are surprised when I tell them how much of a fan I am of Tom Green. I know that as bizarre as he acts, intelligence and wit lurks in the shadows. It is sometimes seen on his MTV television show, but not even close when it comes to Freddy Got Fingered. This flick lacks the candid-ness of the t.v show. The jokes are mostly stupid and solely in the film for shock value. Most of you will say, ""Well, all that Tom Green is, is shock value"". And feel that way if you must, but this time around,if it ever does, it doesn't work, and neither does the pathetic subplot or B rated star cameos."
5,The hardest I've ever laughed in a theater,I saw this in L.A.-- and what made me laugh even harder were the people grabbing their coats and leaving. What do they want? Some clever send-up? A Bette Midler predictarama? Maybe another awful Will Farrel flick where he's a cool party animal?It wasn't brilliant. It was funny. Funniest thing I've seen since the Zucker bros movies.
5,ok ok this movie is stupid but it is funny,this movie is very funny and yes it is very stupid but hey that is what makes it great. The horse and the elephant thing could have been done without. You'll either love it or hate it but I loved it
2,I'd rate this movie higher if Tom Green wasn't such a sick (...),"Here are some reasons why this movie is so freakin awful. He whacks off a horse, he whacks off an elephant, plays with a deer's corpse and some other sick crap that ain't even funny. Added to the fact that this movie also ruined Rip Torn's career for good."
5,Only for the terribly twisted - which I proudly am!,"This movie plays off of probably one of the sickest, most demeaning of acts. It makes most people cringe. But then, in the end, looks at it for what it is and realizes that it's not the most possibly demeaning thing possible...Most people do way worse, more disgusting acts for pleasure.If you're buying this movie for an intense crime drama where the wrong guy is accused, then for the most part you're wrong. That's not the primary meaning of the word ""fingered"" here. If that freaks you out, you should move on. But if you enjoy more risque humor once in awhile, and can laugh at an unfortunate series of events leading up to that point (told as a hazy backstory that gets clearer and clearer), then this movie is HILARIOUS!I'm just hoping that the NC-17 blu-ray version that Tom Green promised comes out, so I can update my copy."
5,Funniest Movie Of All Time,This is the funniest movie of all time. Purely genius in all its stupidity. Those who dislike it are uptight and their favorite TV Show is Friends.Own this movie and just enjoy. THE ROCKETS BETTY!
1,"Horrible, just horrible...",I can't say this movie had anything redeeming about it whatsoever. Very unfunny--just gross.
4,Very funny flick.......mostly (hot and cold),"Yes...yes this movie is stupid but its also insanely cool! I agree with some of these reviewers... there are some unnecessary gross bits (eg. the birthday boy) and i think its a little over the top at times, but overall its a pretty funny flick. When Tom Greens good hes hilarious.. when he's not he's plain dumb."
1,Please give me back my two hours I wasted...,"This has got to be the worst movie the comes to recent memory. I'm all for comedies and most crude humor but this is such a terrible movie I don't see how anyone would like it...even diehard Tom Green fans. I'm lucky I only rented this movie..and I'm even luckier I didn't have to pay for this junk. I wouldn't be surprised if people were flocking back to local stores for refunds. If you're reading this and haven't seen the movie yet, consider yourself one of the lucky ones. I still like Tom Green...but this movie would've been better off having never been made. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time. It gets a lot better than this."
1,"If U watch it, U can be sure U'll regret it!","Oh my! Believe me: THIS is a bad movie! You may like tom green in his mtv show, he is fun sometimes, and seems to have endless new ideas... on mtv. But THIS MOVIE IS A TOTAL DISASTER! It is not only cruel, rude and stupid. It also has no story and no fun. After 20 minutes, I couldn't bear anymore and stopped watching it. I tried to see some more of it, but I confess that I never reached the end... and probably never will!"
1,Is there anything lower than 1 star?,"Quite frankly, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. There is no plot, and the jokes and gags just aren't funny. They're totally unrelated to what is going on in the movie. It's basically just a stream of Tom Green's sexual (both human and animal) fantasies along with other just plain disgusting things that Tom Green thinks are funny, all very loosely tied to a plot that goes about as deep as a kiddie pool."
3,Pitch-black comedy.,"This movie is not for everyone-possibly not for anyone. For someone to laugh at all the jokes in this movie, that someone would have to be a sadist of the highest level. It is still very funny and Rip Torn is an excellent choice for Gordon's (Tom's) father. Tom Green is a genius, and this movie is him doing what he does best--but expect to cringe more than a few times. This makes ""Scary Movie"" look like family entertainment."
2,Most of it just isn't funny,"In this film, Tom Green stars as Gord Brody, a 28 years-old who seems to be stuck in his parents apartment for ever, unless he can finally realize his long life dream of becoming a cartoonist. But the plot isn’t really worth discussing. It’s all just an excuse for putting Tom Green in different situations where he can let his “talent” run wild. These situations include Tom Green beating a crippled girl with a stick, convincing the State that his father has been molesting his brother, Freddie, for several years (hence the title, FREDDIE GOT FINGERED)… Some of this is funny, sure, but most of it is just annoying (and the constant screaming and jellying of Tom Green makes it even more annoying). I agree with the critics who butchered this film (for the most part its not good). I would recommend you seeing this film before purchasing it (even if you’re a Tom Green fan (because I too like some of what he’s done on television))."
4,FINGERED,"This movie was made to shock and digust moviegoers and judging by the reviews below it has acomplished this beyond a shadow of a doubt. I thought it was pretty funny though, and if you can look at it with an open mind and a strong stomach, you will too."
3,70%House/30%Trance,"If your a big fan of House Music, than this CD is for you. Both CD's build with strong house beats & than gets Trancey with Van Dykes ""Another Way"", Chemical Brothers ""Hey Boy, Hey Girl"", ATB ""9PM"", and Chicane's ""Saltwater"". I'm a big fan of Progressive House/Trance so this CD just didn't have enough of it. But if your into house, this is for you."
5,The best preschool Sunday school curriculum I've used,"I've taught preschool Sunday school for six years now, and this curriculum is absolutely the best for kids. I haven't used _Faith-Building With Preschoolers_ but imagine that it is just as good as this book. Rather than trying to make kids learn a new story every week, this book spreads out the curriculum so that you can teach a story over the course of a month. In addition, it has a virtue that the students learn along with the story.For example, the first lesson is about Abraham and Sarah wanting to have a baby. I was amazed when my preschoolers, a couple months after we finished the story, were able to say that they were being patient like Sarah when we were waiting for the microwave to finish popping popcorn for us.If you want a curriculum that is much more young children friendly than many of the usual curriculums, this one is it!"
5,happy customer,Book arrived in the condition it was described as - shipping was very quick! Would definately use this seller again
5,I Loved It!,"I picked up this book on a whim in search of a little early Christmas spirit after the recent events and found myself unable to put it down. Donna Vanliere's heart warming story not only captivated me, but restored my faith in human nature.Although I thought at one point the story might be predictable, I found just the opposite -- it was life affirming and bittersweet, driving home the importance of faith, hope, love and family.This book is beautiful and is going to everyone on my Christmas list."
3,A quaint story,This is a nice little story suitable for reading by the fireplace on a snowy day. My 12-year old enjoyed it quite a bit. As an adult though I found it to be a bit too much like a made-for-TV-movie (which it apparently became).
4,Christmas Shoes is going to be a movie!,"The book is great. It's definitely one I'll read every December to my grandson.CBS will have a ""made for T V"" movie this Christmas season based on THE CHRISTMAS SHOES. I hope they don't leave out Ms. VanLiere's references as to why we have Christmas in the first place!"
4,this book should come with kleenex!,"I've heard the song a hundred times and I promised myself I wouldn't cry when I read the book. Somebody please slap me! I cried until my face was unrecognizable! VERY, touching story. VanLiere's books are always short, but packed with full of character."
5,THE CHRISTMAS SHOES.,THE CHRISTMAS SHOES BOOK WAS A GIFT FOR MY SISTER-IN-LAW. WE BOTH LOVE THE SONG & COULD NOT WAIT TO READ THE BOOK..
1,Hated it,"I didn't find anything ""touching"" about this book. After reading the description, I expected a profound and heartwarming story. Wrong! I found this story heartbreaking and sappy. Evidently I'm in the minority regarding this book, but personally I don't want to read about a mother dying of cancer on Christmas Eve in front of her children. That broke my heart! When I finished reading this I wasn't moved, I was depressed."
4,Rich Man/Poor Man,"An enjoyable juxtaposition of a rich man who truly has it all, but who is way to selfish to recognize his riches and risks losing it all; and a poor man rich in ways not always visible. A little sappy and light, you will need to get your hankies ready for a peek into what makes Christmas for these families. - Mamalinda"
5,Great Book,"This is a great book, you may need a bunch of tissues if your like me and cry whenever there is a sad story that involves a child losing his mother."
5,Precious inspiring story!,"What a precious book! If you're someone who still believes in miracles, you should love this book. I mean real miracles - ones that can change the course of a person's life forever. It's a precious story that will find you crying, laughing and anything in between. I love the way the author views death - a take-away from the book for myself. At any rate, I would recommend that anyone read this inspiring work of fiction that will, without a doubt, warm your heart."
5,Great Book For Anyone,This book is heartwarming and great read for anyone of any age. It would be a wonderful choice to read to a Sunday School class or to your children.
3,Christmas Shoes have a few holes,"I can't resist the glittering, shiny covers of the Christmas Books at my bookstore. Each year I buy a few and this year I bought The Christmas Shoes. The book is an easy read and is suitable for young people. The story is a classic story and predictable.As an author, I found the point of view changes annoying. At one time, Robert magically knows what's going on after he leaves his mother's house. How is that possible? I counted three clichés on one page.Still, the story is touching and I shed a few tears. It's worth reading just as a reminder of the important things in life."
4,"base ten magnetic set okay, but....","couldn't they have made them of different colors? I teach spec ed, and selecting the correct pieces is easier for some children when the colors vary. My non-magnetic set is yellow, green and red, wish this matched. Students do LOVE using it, however. Magnets are sturdy, and the size is excellent.Foam Magnetic Base 10 Set"
5,A Joy Ride!,"I never wanted to part ways with the eccentric characters of this fast paced, hilarious novel. I loved Karim and his extra-ordinary family, flaws and all. And I cared for their welfare. Set in London of the 1960s - the author skillfully introduces the reader to the racist abuses, class and existential struggles of that era that are still true today most likely.If you are tired of the predictable works of most contemporary authors and eager for something with a little snap, spice and depth, look no further. The language alone will STAGGER you.I am in love with Hanif Kureishi.Good Job!"
1,Annoying. Couldn't get past the first few chapters,"This is the type of book where the author is just trying to hard to come up with witty, out of this world scenarios, which make it all seem contrived.I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes.

3,Teenage Angst,Interesting sketches of characters -- though most of them were not as fully developed as I would like. This book would be better authored by John Irving with more character development and possibly less raw angst.
5,None Better,"This is, without a doubt, one of the best live shows EVER recorded. I saw this version of the band live 3-4 times in the early 70's and those shows remain among the best of thousands of concerts I have attended, mixed or crewed. Truly an amazing preformance!!!"
2,Desperately in need of expansion,"Poco was an awesome live act in the 1970s. But this low-energy, poorly engineered, niggardly recording doesn't really reveal the fire they exhibited on stage, in person. Surely, Columbia has some unreleased live tracks in the vault from this period.Where, for example is ""Nobody's Fool/El Tonto De Nadie, Regresa""? This song sounded totally different live, with Rusty Young's pedal-steel literally shrieking out an extended ear-shattering solo. I'd love to hear that track live again.How about it Columbia?"
3,Nice looking shorts,"These are nicely styled compared to what is available as hiking shorts in any local stores. My only complaint is the use of velcro to hold the pockets closed. It is necessary to 'peel' your pockets open thus, it takes two hands to put your wallet back in the pocket. Try doing that while sitting in your car. Otherwise, nice shorts."
5,Must try!!!,I first had this a year ago and had such a hard time finding it again locally. And suddenly yesterday there it was! Unique flavor - definite must try!
1,Another Euro-Western Bites the Dust,"After escaping Bondage for the first time, Sean Connery utilized his box-office clout to star in a dreadful Louis L'Amour adaptation. ""Shalako"" (1968) managed to round up director Edward Dmytryk and a fine international cast for a two-hour exercise in Euro-Western boredom. Zero chemistry between Connery and Brigitte Bardot - both hopelessly lost in the Almeria landscape. Not even the presence of Woody Strode can redeem this turkey."
3,Widescreen but NOT Anamorphic,"MGM has suddenly stopped making these older films Anamorphic (Enhanced for Widescreen T.V.'s)which doesn't make sense. Other recent titles include ""Follow That Dream"", ""A Minute To Pray, A Second To Die"" and ""The Magnificent Seven Ride!"". If this bothers you as much as it does me, send an email to MGM."
3,There's A New Guy At MGM And He's So Out Of Touch!,"Another DVD from MGM that is widescreen (That's Great) but it's not ANIMORPHIC ( Enhanced For Widescreen T.V.'s ). This seems to be the trend for MGM now and it doesn't make any sense. Previous releases were animorphic. I can only assume there's a new guy in charge and he's an idiot! ( The other recent titles are ""Follow That Dream"" and ""The Magnificent Seven Ride!"".If this bothers you as much as it does me then send an email to MGM. These movies deserve better treatment."
1,It Stinks,"This was an all European production based on a Louis Lamour novel and that's the most decent thing I can say. Well, to be fair Connery does acquite himself well as a western hero. Everyone else is truly wasted. An oddity as a film at best."
3,Fun movie,"This movie was fun and had a lot of shooting. The book had more intrigue, but they came close for hollywood. The only thing that disappointed me about the movie is that in the book Shalako is from my home town in Texas - the movie doesn't mention this."
3,Shalko (Shan Connery),An excellent Louis L'Amour story Well acted & movie copy had a electronic barely visable scrach in movie.
2,Not Quite What I Was Expecting,"The main focus of this book in on the creation of a professional software development association or organization, similar to the ones of doctors and arquitects. The discussion is interesting, but not very useful if you have to deal with the problems and challenges of the day-to-day life in software development."
4,"It succeeds as a ""vision"" book","It is clear the author cares very deeply about his profession. He is searching for a way to increase software development professionalism. I did not view this book as a how to cook book. I viewed it as a vision book that offers suggestions on what needs to happen for future software development. Viewed in that light the book succeeds well. Unfortunately some of his analogies to other professions show lack of understanding for those professions, but otherwise the book is good food for thought.If you are looking for a more concrete books on how to develop software now, he has a good reading list in his book Code Complete, second edition chapter 35. Also check his web site: http://www.construx.com/professionaldev/"
5,As gorgeous as the movie.,"This is a must-have coffee-table book (it's also available in paperback) for all fans of Paul Verhoeven's brilliant, moving epic; it comes close to capturing the lush beauty of the movie itself. Anyone with taste, style, and/or half a brain will cherish both the gorgeous book and the inspiring, elegant movie. Thank you to the publishers of the book as well as the filmmakers."
2,Talking in Circles,"Most of this book talks in complex circles and is difficult to follow. I found it very frustrating to to read, unless a specific example was outlined. Most of the gist of what Mr. Zuchov is trying to convey can be summed up in 10 pages. You get what you deserve, what goes around comes around, treat others as you wish to be treated, look inside yourself for the answers.I bought the book because I wanted to see if I can attain a ""higher self"" -- and that is the most important decision anyone can make BEFORE choosing this book. If you aren't committed before buying, this book may just cloud the issue further. A lot of gobblygook which could have been written in a MUCH more straightforward way. My question is -- how did the editors let this book get published with SOOOO many run-on sentences? Zuchov's writing style is pretty out there, and I'm a writer!"
4,"Dificult read, few good ideas","I just finished Seat of the Soul and Soul Stories. While Seat of the Soul is the more difficult read, I found few good ideas and lots of ""this is the way it is"" righteousness. He lumps all animals into groups of souls, a dolphin soul, a dog soul. Where does he get this insight and why does he force himself to deal with the evolution of animal to human souls to eternal souls with such convoluted reasoning. I found myself reading and rereading passages just to try to understand his use of intention and personality and temptation. I got the same message repeatedly, and I found myself saying OK where is the depth of feeling and thought to justify all this obtuseness. Still I give it 4 stars for the attempt to get people to think of the consequences of their actions. But there are better books out there."
3,Gary Zukav,Gary Zukav's third chapter titled Responsibility was very rewarding read. I could not have been more enlightened. After reading the third chapter I had number unanswered questions...In chapter three Zukav was ubiquitously. It appears that is this chapter he was trying to connect previous chapter and claims into one idea. All things considered Zukav made some valid and edifying statements. However readers should read this book with no ingenuousness.
1,Dont like it...,"I dont like it the way it was written, it's too far from reality. You can say it's like introducing a new religion."
1,Offensive New Age Garbage,As a trained biologist who had read Zukav's earlier book I was interested to see what he had to say about evolution of the soul. But I was too offended by his amaterish and inadequate understanding of evolution to read very far into this book. Finally I threw it away.
2,"Don't Take Yourself Too Seriously, Zukav","Zukav's views are derivative and yet very interesting. The book is worth reading, but after listening to him speak on NPR's ""New Dimensions"" I'm afraid the man is taking himself way too seriously. He has begun a project called ""Genesis"" (I think he has a God complex) where he is offering retreats (California, of course) to help people ""evolve"". I do however, like his initiative to enlighten people about the responsibility of free-will and the consequences of being unaware of your emotions."
5,To Live Authentically,I have to believe that the people who wrote negative reviews on this book do not have a clue as to how important spiritual growth is to the human species at this time in our history. Gary Zukov is on the cutting edge of the development of the human species as far as spiritual growth is concerned. His ideas on living as an authentic person provides a road map we all can use to develop not only our personal spirituality but that of the entire species. I believe we are moving as a species from our spiritual childhood through our spiritual adolesence and into spiritual adulthood. Zukov is leading the way.
2,too deep for me,"I saw this man on Oprah and liked his ""way of thinking"". Oprah mentioned his book ""The Seat of the Soul"" and that there is where she learned a lesson that had stayed with her through life. ""The results you get from life are the direct actions of your true intentions."" Anyway, the book turned out to be way too deep and not very practical."
1,New Age and nothing else!,"It is truly amazing that hundreds of people actually find ""an answer"" in writings such as this one. When I read all of the comments from readers about how this book has ""changed their lives"", how ""it has given them answers"" and so on, I truly felt sad that our world is so messed-up and confused that any Tom, Dick or Harry can pontificate with such arrogance about things that he has no concrete proof of and we, like a bunch of sheep, buy it and praise it as though he is the true ORACLE of PERFECT TRUTH. Start listening to those that have proven their love for us and not to those trying to have big bank accounts by trying to re-invent the wheel Besides, do any of you know of anyone that has truly come back from death to tell you in detail what happens there? I don't, except for Jesus. So until it's my time to go, I will listen to the voice of experience."
2,"A spiritual option on how to look at the world, nothing more","Ok this is one of the many tries to give you the best information about the book, because every time I discover something new, although it has been some time since I've read it. It's a very spiritual (not religious) book and if you're not up for it in any way than don't buy it. I consider it more a book on how you can see the world we live in, but not to get to know your authentic self, for me that's McGraw or Wayne Dyer (the 2nd one is more gentle than the first, but has the same ideas). The things Zukav talks about, have been mentioned many times before, so it's not really original and last but not least because the story is build up from various little parts it can be hard to follow, so instead just get the same info from Oprah's website!"
2,The Seat of the Soul by Gary Zukav,"I bought this as a gift and haven't read it myself. I was told, beforehand, how great a book it was. That was my reasoining for purchasing it."
3,"Very disappointing for the ""average"" reader","Seat of the Soul is very over the top and not ""user friendly"" for the common man/woman. It ""tells"" you a lot but doesn't give one exercises in achieving what Zukav says we all can have. Very disappointed."
2,If he weren't so self-righteously pompous,"I'm 90 pages in and I think I'm going to call it a day. It is refreshing to read about souls and karma and reincarnation - none of these being new topics to write about - but so unrefreshing to hear someone expound on so many deep models of energy and spirit and soul without once making a reference to another writer, or prefacing one thought with ""I believe this to be so"". It's not much different than a deeply religious person expounding their dogma ""because they know it to be true"". Period. You know what that's about in the end.OK, so his intuition, along with his pendulums and peyote have convinced him, and now he's convincing us. I just can't read material disseminated in this manner. The credibility is totally called into question. Or just believe blindly."
1,I checked it out at the library and returned it after 1 chap,"Before I was willing to actually pay for the book, I checked it out at the library. I had heard Oprah raving about the author and book and thought it might have something to say. I could barely read it! The writing was so confusing and circular that it was hard to extract the actual idea. You'd think as a physicist (teaching, I believe), he would be able to explain his theories in a more coherent way."
2,Perplexed,"While the book is very useful in some respects, I can't help but feel this guy is a scheister (sp). It's not that I don't believe a physicist can be multi-talented; it's that I question his background and his ability to preach the way he does. I think his exposition on karma is good, but the rest of it is based on...what?I also don't know if I believe in reincarnation, being a practicing Christian. Ofcourse, we all live on after death, but do we really return, life after life? How does this man know? I'm just a little skeptical about some of his presumptions. Does he have a doctorate in psychology?"
1,A Different Take on Nothing New,"I had to read this book twice. That's not to say I was forced to, rather I had to read it a second time in an attempt to see what all the rave was about. Frankly, I didn't find it, even the second time around. To anyone who hass taken any time to explore their own spirituality either through reading, meditation, or direct experience through nature, church or coven this book said nothing you didn't figure out alread. It seems more like a short cut to spirituality for the lazy. Although I don't feel books should be burned, I don't find this one of any value seeing that it attempts to cram into your head what you should have to work to figure out, causing some really strange side effects like bibling this book. If you have the will power, I'd advise you avoid it."
5,A Must Read,This is a book that you will want to have in your library to refer to over and over again as the years go by. It has a lot of depth and information for the evolving of your soul!
2,Second Rate Philosophy Described Better Elsewhere --,"Now Oprah - please don't carried away here. Gary Zukav was not the first to discuss reincarnation and the immortal spirit that lives on after our body dies -- he doesn't even do a good rehash of the ancient and holy scriptures that provided the basis of his material. As one other reviewer suggested, Zukav does not cite any sources for his views, and just spews all his loose philosophy as if he was Moses. On the other hand, he does give a good description of Karma - what goes around comes around. In that case, we can expect that someone, some day, will steal one of Zukav's few original ideas, and make a lot of money after espousing it as his own."
1,Not Enlightening...Don't waste your time..,I read a lot of new age spiritual literature and this has got to be some of the worst. The author doesn't provide any support for his theories. Where did he get this stuff. I would venture a guess that he made it up. Don't waste your time reading this book.
1,The Seat of Your Pants,"I was very happy with Dancing Wu Li and looked forward to an insightful journey into our inner selves. Unfortunately, this book came up wanting. A few uncited William James, Augustine and eastern philosophy references, mixed with Jung and Thermodynamics does not show Zukov to have either the inclination or the understanding of philosophical thought that has come before. He provides no point of reference for his argument and no personal transcendent experience. In sum, a waste of money. More Karma is available with the astrological section of the newspaper. Don't buy this book and feed poor work."
5,For the more advanced soul......,"Look, The Seat of the Soul is for those who are beyond the Celestine Prophecy, The Secret, Flow, any book teaching you self esteem, or how to get rich. In college terms the Celestine Prophecy is English 101 and this book is a 400 level graduate course. Not that the two books are similar, but that you can't go from reading this book to a Celestine Prophecy. One also needs an understanding of Eastern philosophies to fully understand the messages. So no, it's not for everyone, but everyone will get to the point where it will be for them, because one of the main messages is that we are ALL headed that way, the way to evolve as humans.If you read it and get it, congratulations, you are an advanced soul."
5,One of many books to open the understanding of Soul.,"I found this book to be THE leapboard into spiritual understanding and empowerment. For me, Seat of the Soul is written in more of a philosophical and scientific language that I understand.If one is to look at most of the books on these topics we would see that they are all speaking to the same ideas and philosophies. Just as we are all very different and yet the same, so are these books.I would recommened reading this book as well as The power of now and A new earth."
2,Well written but unsurprising,I found this attempt at an integration of new age ideas with hard science interesting but problematic. The book's use of words that appear to have a meaning of their own but which are only definable on a personal basis was a recurring problem for me. The book offers nothing new but does review interesting material.
1,No proof whatsoever,"The author does not provide any proof of animals having ""group souls"", vs. humans who have ""individual souls"". I believe my cats, and all higher animals have individual souls. The ""group soul"" mentality may help people eat their meat and continue to slaughter innocent animals for food. Nothing the author writes is proven - we're just supposed to take his word for it. Well, I don't believe it."
3,SOME ORIGINAL INSIGHTS,"I found his theory of the transition from the 5-sensory to the multi-sensory very interesting and gained new insights from his thoughts on the relationship between the personality and the soul. However, the 2nd part of the book starts to drag a bit with constant re-iteration of ideas that I have already encountered in many other books. A bit more focus on practical application of these ideas would have been better. All in all a pleasant read with some new discoveries but certainly not in my Top 10 metaphysical books."
3,Lacks Every day Experiences...,"""Be Mindful of the words that you use and the actions that you live and who you are and how it is you use your power"", the book touches the basics of the soul in order to give a better understanding of how to approach and act to different situations.It does bring in the concept of multisensory in human beings and explains in detail the theorectical part of the soul and the different phases it goes through to build its personality...A good book read for basics but it would have been much more convincing and powerful if everyday experiences and examples were included. You feel there is something missing, does not give you that full satisfaction for such a delicate issue..."
1,Confused Man,I was very disappointed in this book. I expected a book about spirituality and God but instead got a book about New Age beliefs and not many references to God.
2,Difficult to keep my concentration on ist message.,"My appologies to Oprah, but I cannot concure with her on the quality of the words within this book. And beyond the words I looked for a message and could find none. In the first few chapters Mr. Zukav recommends we listen to our inner voice to determine the truth of something. I did, and both of us cannot grasp the written message of the book. I read a book a week or more and have knowledge of readable writing that has a message. I recommend a do not buy."
1,The Seat of the Soul,"I feel that the author is ""way out there"" in regards to his theories. I have two chapters left to read---I will read to the end, but have gotten very little, if anything, from this book."
2,Poorly done,"The writing itself is terrible. I can't imagine a publisher allowing it to be released as written. Too many loooonng sentences, riddled with commas. Some of the ""statements"" are virtually uninterpretable. My high school English teacher would have given me a ""D"", at best.Many ""quantum leaps"" which assert something as fact with literally no information to support the position. The ""miracle"" that it became a best-seller is a serious indictment on the intelligence level of our nation's readers. It would seem that many people are without a base of existence and are desperately searching for a foundation.This is not it."
2,The Seat of the Soul,"This book is very difficult reading for a beginner to ""New Age/Metaphysics."" Why? Because the scope of the book is too broad. The author seems to be knowledgeable in reincarnation but what are the sources of his findings? It seems to be a book based on his opinions which is not something worth paying for! I kept thinking the next chapter would clarify things but instead I found myself going deeper and deeper to nowhere. I understand that many aspects of reincarnation are based on beliefs but some facts need to be presented to offer validity to ones theories. If I were a skeptic regarding reincarnation, this book would not assist me in obtaining information to convince me that reincarnation is possible. Instead, it would deter me and encourage me to believe the whole idea is ludicrous! Luckily, I'm not easily swayed!"
1,Skip this book!,"This book is a terrible bastardization of metaphysical principals and is couched in terms that are senseless. (5 senses vs. multi-sensory. Isn't five multi?) Not only are the labels Zukav attaches to profound phenomena bizarre, single paragraphs display unfollowable leaps of logic. Most of his ideas have realistic foundations in metaphysical thought shared by many religions, but here they are twisted into strange new age hooha. Skip this book. There are other far better things to read. Read buddhist texts. Read yogic texts. Read something else."
1,confusing boring tiresome ...,"Sorry Gary, after seeing you on Oprah I had high hopes. Recall your book from the publishers and try again. You make interesting and thought provoking commens on the TV show but this book did anything but elucidate them. I hate to not finish a book I've paid good money for but this one could not be stomached."
3,Good Stuff in a Too Round About Way,"As I read Gary's book, I realized the content was important and relevant, but I found it hard to get through. I've read many spiritual books of this nature, and this was the book which took me the longest to read. If you stick with it, there are paragraphs which make it all come together; ""A-ha moments."" It's just getting to them that's the problem. I'd give this five stars on content, but only 3 on readability. Read ""Conversations With God"" first if you haven't already."
2,gibberish,"I agree with another reviewer that said if the author had stated ""This is my opinion..."" I could be more forgiving , however that was not the case. Unlike that reader I could bring myself to finish reading this giberrish after about half way through the book. If you have ever seen this guy on Oprah he appears to be nice enough but I get the impression he sees himself as some kind of new age prophet in his mind. He is all knowing..."
5,Good Book,"If you don't read this book you are missing out on alot- He teaches you how choice and intentions affect our interactions and feelings with others and that we are more than just people with personality, that our soul goes beyond your personality-by dwelling at ""the multisensory"" level we really understand our connection to others and our true purpose. If you don't know your purpose, read this book.!"
2,Not an Easy Trip,"I was not suprise when this book ventured into the spiritualism quite a bit. Although I don't choose to go there, there is nothing deceitful about the title. I appreciate that. Can't say that I would recomend it for spiritual growth."
2,Mother Theresa meets Shirley MacLaine!,"I agree with the reviewers who say that this book took very simplistic concepts and made them complicated and obtuse. This whole book could be summed up in ""Do unto others as you would have others do unto you"" and we'll all become a big, fat happy world. Write a book about it, and you'll have a big, fat happy wallet.I actually agree with the author's ideas of Karma, reincarnation, etc., but I've read better books on it. Try Michael Newton's ""Journey of Souls""--same ideas, much more interesting, & concrete examples of daily life experiences & how they relate to the soul."
1,I may never know,"Actually, I haven't read it yet, just the reviews, which have deterred me from putting this title on my shopping list for the time being. ""Sort the wheat out from the chaff', is a principal I apply to everything in life. What suits the reader is a personal issue and I can certainly see that some of you have some issues to deal with. I'm actually scanning for a different type of self-help book."
3,"""WAY TOO DEEP FOR ME""","OK I AM WHAT I AM BUT IO FOUND THIS BOOK WAY OVER MORE HEAD ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTOOD THE BASICS ""WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND"" AND "" OUR SOUL LIVES ON FOREVER"" I WANTED TO GET MORE OUT OF THIS.... SO I WENT TO HIS WEB SITE. IT HELPED. WISH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN A LITTLE SIMPLER BUT IS IT WORTH THE MONEY? PAPER BACK YES! LET ME GO READ IT AGAIN MAYBEY THE 5TH TIME I WILL UNDERSTAND A LITTLE MORE."
1,the seat of the soul,The seat of the soul is expensive toilet paper. Do not buy it. Do not read it. You have been warned.
3,To be loved AND hated!...,"I confess I have not read this book yet, though I did see Zukav on ""Oprah"" today. One must at least be intrigued by the range of reviews from ""Just Plain Bad"" to ""Amazing & Insightful"". Makes one glad for public libraries and the opportunity to read it for FREE!"
2,When sense goes down the gutter,"Well, what happened to Gary Zukav. I must have thought he was crazy or something. What a piece of baloney this was!!! I don't know, maybe I am becoming insensitive or what but I thought this book was pretty bad. I have not read the ""Dancing Wu Li Masters"" but I am now afraid to try in spite of the rave reviews. This book is a repetition of age old hindu mantras, and this not even well explained mixed with common, everyday ideas about metaphysics. Real pity. I could as well right a bunch of stuff that I imagine and would have done a better job than Mr. Zukav. I don't recommend this book....it is a bunch of baloney."
5,Spiritual Perfection,If you though that you where spiritually correct before reading this book. Guess what? You have miles to go. Gary Zukav actually makes you think and feel your spiritual being. He creates a spritual opportunity for you with the insightful observances he makes. The great thing about this book is it's left up to you what path to pursue. He doesn't cloud the issue with psycho babbble that gets you lost after the first paragraph. If you want to be a better person in the year two thousand this is the book for you. It will actually help you obtain your own spiritual perfection.
3,"Cannot hurt, might help theory.....","Gary Z is soft spoken, mesmerizing and gentle. This, of itself, makes one desire reading his Theory on the Esoteric. Gee, what does he know, that I wish I knew, so I could at least be that at peace? The book reads well, makes one ponder the possibliities of it all, and does not leave one bankrupt ($) in the end. It is an affordable trip to one man's version of the big ""Why?"" Twas fun...."
4,changed my perception of what the soul is,"Although the book was difficult at times to follow, Gary really opened my eyes up, in regards to the endless possibilities as to what our soul is comprised of. I will say that a second reading of the book is probably a good idea, since there was alot of information given at one time"
2,A meandering road to nowhere!,"Provocative? Life-altering? Please! I did not find this book original or thought-provoking in the least. Rather, it was a colossal chore to read. He rambles on with clumsy, run-on sentence after another and then, never gets to the point, anyway -- let alone offers any real data or even pseudo-scientific evidence to support his dramatic claims. I honestly am at a loss to understand the cult following behind this book."
5,Read this one first,Read this one first before the other ones. Open your mind... amazing and so thought provoking... it all makes since
5,Real Spiritual Guidance,"This book offers real spiritual guidance for those seeking a higher level of awareness and knowledge of themselves and the human experience. The theories are well-structured and thorough, with examples that clarify the principles. I found this book to be very helpful in my search for meaning and purpose in my life."
3,Lessons for life,"While I don't agree with all the beliefs promoted by this book, I think the lessons are loud and clear and very relevent in today's society.I feel I take away some valuable knowledge which will hopefully be a guide for the the future."
2,Buyer Beware!,"Simply put, Gary Zukav is a scientist in New Age clothing. I found his ideas regarding the souls of animals distressingly Cartesian. Nor does Mr. Zukav give credit to the many religious and metaphysical authorities that so heavily inform his work. Many of the principles he shares can be found in the rich symbolism of the Bible and the Bhagavad Gita. Endorsement from the richest and most persuasive talk show host in the country has given this book an unfair advantage over other informative and relevant books on the same subject. I would suggest ""Seth Speaks"" and the entire ""Seth"" series of books to any one who is searching for the nature of the ""soul."" I got more out of reading texts dictated by the disembodied voice of Seth than I did the mouth of a displaced scientist whose earthly function is to sell books and make television appearances."
4,Wonderful book for non-physicists that will cure souls.,"Great paradigm for the future.Learn how to become multi-sensory andwhat guides you.Great physicist, Gary Zukav has done it again.The Dancing Wu Li Masters book will be enhancedby this one in your library.Learn about transformation and what potentialsexist in us all.Good book for non-physicists who want to believein something."
1,Confusing and Unclear,"Although I normally enjoy most of the books that Oprah recommends - this one is a definite ""do not buy"". She praised the book on her show and I quickly ordered it from Amazon. I read some of it nightly but it is a chore to read and I am not left enlightened but just confused. I watched Zukav on Oprah and liked what he said but the messages he tries to bring out in the book are unclear and lost in babble that goes on endlessly. Although I enjoy reading and learning, this book left me perplexed."
5,The way through the life you've created,"This book speaks to many people's longings to know what unlocks the keys to their hearts. When people are unconscious and need to be brought to consciousness they turn to books like these. I object to its dry tone. He could have spiced it up a bit, but that's him."
2,What was I thinking?!,"I guess I didn't know what I was getting myself into on this one. It was recommended to me, so I went out and got it. I read the first few pages and was impressed by his way at looking at life. A few pages later, I felt like I had gotten no where new. I felt like I was reading the same sentence over and over just said in different terms. I lost interest in the book enough quickly. We'll see if I read further."
1,Makes morons feel superior,"That's basically all there is to it. Very simplistic, self-righteous, pompous, but very, very flattering.I don't think the book contains a single genuine thought.If I didn't know better, I would say it was written as a prank, or as a dare."
2,Not very gripping,"I found this book to be very bland and though I finished it, I really felt it was a waste of time. The points discussed in the book are common day logic, but not practical in the real world."
1,childish pap for adults,"It's really bad. Dreadful. New age pap: preachy, sanctimonious ultra-simplistic, just plain laughable. I could barely get to page 50, and it has large-ish type, wide margins & leading.Reading Great Eastern Sun is sort of like eating a fine meal - I feel better after reading it, really fortified by its sustenance. This was like eating a bad meal, it made me want to puke. Zukav wrote a book in '79 called the Dancing Wu Li Masters that I'd heard of, and his Seat was a NYT bestseller, so I thought it might be at least ok."
2,"If you loved Wu Li Masters, you'll hate this one!","Gary Zukav has obviously lived in Marin Countytoo long. This new book is a smarmy amalgam ofNew Age hooey based on the unsupportedprecept that human beings are evolving to somehigher state. Actually, of course, we're ratherplayed out as a species and we're working realhard to make our planet uninhabitable for ourown kind. Save your money!"
1,Worthless nonsense.,"I was tricked into buying this book. I was told it explored the human consciousness and that it was profound and deep. In reality it's made up nonsense. The writer knows very little on all subjects that he is writing about. The man clearly has little concept of what evolution is, cause and effect, soul, or karma. He uses these terms incorrectly though out the entire book. He talks down to the reader. And gives more illustrations of his theories than are necessary to fill pages. This book is very dogmatic. He describes bizarre metaphysics of his own creation. If you are looking to start some sort of cult this may be the book for you."
2,"offensive, interesting, occasionally inspirational","I found Zukav's authoritarian, black/white style of presenting his opinions about a complex subject intrinsically unknowable, as arrogant and offensive. I also was delighted to see his opinion that many of us suffer from ""splintered personalities"" - which is exactly what 15 years of studying ""Inner family therapy"" has taught me in my private counseling practice. One aspect of that which Zukav omits is that we each have a true Self - an aspect, or ""part"" of our personality which makes wise decisions if the other personality parts ""let it."" I'm also puzzled that Zukav preaches vertical-path soul-focus, vs. ""external power,"" manifested as seeking fame, power, and money - yet his Web site address ends with "".com,"" meaning for-profit, commercial. He has a right to make a living, and ... ? Seems like a double message."
3,Sincere Attempt!,"If you need complexity to consider accepting yourself as Soul evolving toward a greater knowledge of the divine ""god- qualities"" within you,-- then this is the book for you. It is a sincere attempt by the author to explain existence and spiritual growth. So much has already been written on this subject. Mr Zukav covers familiar ground. I liked his interview on ""Oprah"". Again, this is a sincere attempt to help readers explore, understand, and learn how to help themselves. Get in touch with your ""higher self""? Empower yourself through greater self- knowledge? Well, why not?"
4,"With your heart & mind open, you can learn from this book!","Matters of faith and spirituality do not require scientific proofs and authoritative references. Can anyone prove that the words of the Bible or Koran are ""true""? I do not presume to compare ""Seat of the Soul"" with these books, but there are valuable messages contained in it. To receive the gifts of understanding, joy, hope and oneness with the universe that this book gave to me, suspend your insistence that Christianity, Budhism, science, logic or any other belief that you have is the only truth. Open your heart and mind and FEEL what happens when you make choices based on love and compassion as this book suggests. Gary Zukav cannot change your life, only you can do that; however, he has provided us with some very useful insights and perspectives to guide us on the journey. There are many lessons to learn in this book and they will be different for each of us."
3,Questionable,"Desiring some new spiritual insight, I picked up this book, Conversations with God and An Encounter With A Prophet. Conversations and Encounter I found inspiring. My mother once told me if you don't have anything good to say about someone do not say anything at all. This review is done."
3,It makes an important point!,"My wife bought the book after seeing the author on Oprah. I read it and found that I do not agree with some of the concepts he mentions, such as reincarnation. However, I think it does make an important point: we need to go beyond taking care of our minds and bodies and pay a special attention to our souls, especially when it comes to our relationships."
4,The Seat of the Soul,"I has seen Gary Zukav on Oprah several times so I thought I would read his book. His style is very wordy and I found myself re-reading passages at times to figure out what he is saying. I found if I remembered his style of speaking, the reading was easier and made more sense.(Mr Rodgers slow and deliberate) The content of the book speaks to the make up of the soul and our earthly bodies. I found his desciptions more complete and I got a better feel for what the soul is like. Gary's thought on the evolution of the soul and reincarnation were very interesting and informative. Even though I have read other books on the subject I think I understand the soul and reincarnation much better now. I will read his other books as well."
5,The soul by the seat of the pants,"A book of revelations,Gary Zukav has performed magic in melding modern ''Western''thought with the Buddist tradition. His writing rings true and was the eye opener for me, even though I was open minded about spiritualism. If your searching for a path, take a read."
2,New Age Dogma,"Gary Zukav is a writer who burns both hot and cold: Hot in ""Dancing Wu Li Masters"" and cold in ""Seat of the Soul."" The first book succeeds because it attempts to enlighten the reader through carefully crafted explanations of complex physical phenomena. By contrast, ""Seat of the Soul"" fails because it offers nothing to support or substantiate the many claims made about the spiritual world. While this may be acceptable to those already indoctrinated into the received wisdoms of the New Age, the more sceptical reader will find it difficult to buy what Zukav is selling. The ""Seat of the Soul"" is one long, drawn out lecture and a disappointing companion to ""Dancing Wu-Li Masters"". But perhaps more disappointing is the fact that this and other examples of New Age tripe like the ""Celestine Prophecy"" rank among the best-sellers. It appears that the dumbing down of America is in full swing."
5,An ah-ha book,Read this years ago and it set a foundation for further reading. Got this one for my boyfriend when we watched Zukav on Super Soul Sunday and were blown away listening to him. My guy doesn't like to read much but he's getting real enjoyment from it. A good read!
4,Great mystical insight,"I love the book and have reccomended it to friends of mine. There was much good insight into the mystical that I did not have before. I'd like to believe all that it said, but, even if I do not believe every word - it gives hope for a better world, better people and a better future beyond this life that we know. A great read. I think this book should be read and re-read, as there is so much to absorb. Renee Block"
3,Put it down early,I couldn't get into this one. Idk I guess I didn't give it a fair chance. I stopped reading 25% of the way through. It could be for someone else but it just wasn't for me.
4,great read,This book is a great read!! I totally reccomend it. Good job Mr. Zukav. I can't wait to read the rest of his publications.
5,The Seat of the Soul is absolutely a core choice.,"This author offers a challenging overview ""what is this all about?"" without the religious dogma, allowing the individual time to make space in their own lives for other possibilites in spiritual choices."
4,Need a breather or feel unfulfilled? Read this book!,"I devoured this book over the weekend. While I found the writing somewhat verbose, many of the author's points resonated with me. I don't consider myself a religious person, and I (happily) didn't find this to be a religious book. If you feel like something's missing in your life, and you're suffering from workaholism or other unhealthy addictions, take a break and READ THIS BOOK! While I didn't find the content to be profound, I found it contained good goals to which to strive for in going through life's journey. Great motivators/rationale to take charge and choose your responses to the situations life presents to you."
3,The Seat of the Soul; Postmodern psychobabble at its best.,"This book does have some good points, but the author seems to try and use physics to explain his arguements, and not very well. He should leave science for the experts, and stick to writing self help books. Also I am not sure I agree with his belief that we are currently evolving into a new life form...It has taken 3 million years to get where we are and modern humans only evolved 40,000 years ago...i am sure we are not ready to make the next transition... The last half of the book is hard to believe and stomach, because his basis is so flimsily built."
1,New Age Psychobabble,"I am so happy I borrowed the audiotape from the library. Not having spent money on this makes me extremely happy. You can believe in Angels, Reincarnation, Karma, or whatever you like, but there is not one iota of proof any of it exists. And the funny thing is if you ask for proof the New Ager will say we just don't have the ""sensory capabilites."" Read Carl Sagan's Demon Haunted World especially his section on having a Dragon in his garage. This stuff is just plain silly. Accept reality. There are no angels, ghosts, goblins, alien abductions. We spend a short time here then we die. And we don't have a soul. The brain and the mind are one and when it dies, we die. Although a little depressing, I'd rather than know the truth than be bamboozled. If you read a book by Gary Zukav, read Dancing Wu Li Masters which is excellent layman's guide to physics. But how in the world did he write this?"
2,new age literature and disappointing.,"Mr. Zukav fails to point out in his book that the soul of man is only one facet of mankind' spiritual nature. He also limits his discussion to l) the body, and 2) soul. Nothing is mentioned of the spirit of man of which the soul is only one portion. His research appears to be very restricted. His book touches a little onoriental philosophy, a little on new age mysticism, and a little on elementary reasoning. The result is that a reader would come to a conclusion re: spiritual studies, that it is a type of kindergarden ciricula that is not worth pursuing.One would be far better off to read Rudolf Steiner and Helen Blavatsky as a foundation for future studies."
1,Pantheism in Blue-Jeans,"Another ""feel-good, get-in-touch with your soul"" do-it yourself guide. Zukav has obviously followed Mr. Deepak Chopra around and sees that if he spews this new-age drivel, he too can make quite a lot of money. Poor Oprah... Another book that feeds our culture of the ""subjective""..we must do what ""feels"" good. Please think for a minute and try to grasp this most illogical nonsense! If you must have this ""feel-good"" message in your life, return this book immediately and pick up something by M. Scott Peck...at least he can ground his theories in the realm of the objective."
3,"On Soul, Spirituality, Leadership, and Personal Growth","As author of Psychology of the Hero Soul, (an inspirational book on promoting heroes and responsible leaders in the workplace and everyday life), I used Dr. Zukav's work in ""The Seat of the Soul"" to research more about the meaning of soul and the noble values of the soul.I found Dr. Zukav's book to be an educational and informativeread in the field of spiritual and personal growth and found his academic disertation on the higher values of the soul to be quite enlightening. I would recommend this book to people on the hero's journey of spiritual awakening."
1,More new age pap.,"Very disappointing book. You can get it better by consulting religious texts of the Eastern masters. Zukav preaches karma and how it works, as if ""karma"" were some sort of accepted fact. Annoying."
1,New Age At Its worst,Rambling soul babble ... On the bright side this book is likely to induce sleep. You can also have a warm bath reading a book addressing your brain in top of your heart and your soul. Trust me such books exist so why pick up this one ?
3,Very New Age - not for everyone....,"Gary Zukav has some really interesting theories which can make us look inside ourselves - very good for the introspective side. But this book is very new-age, so for those people of Christian belief, it may not be what you are looking for.If you are willing to read through this and take from it what you need and disregard what you don't, you may find something valuable - there are some good areas on choice and responsibility. But if you don't believe in Karma and reincarnation, much of the book may not interest you.It is not an easy read, by any means. It is a thought provoking book that takes time to digest and understand.I know Oprah recommends this - but I suggest that you consider your beliefs and make your own choice based on them. This book can be useful for many, but it is not for everyone."
4,I keep going back!,"Gary Zukav's ""Seat of the soul"" is a wonderful book to keep on your night table... When life gets tough I dive in that book and it gives me some understanding and makes me at peace with the world. I don't think it's a book that you should read from one cover to the other without taking a ""break""... you will get much more out of it if you read one chapter, then stop to allow your soul to grasp the information. The only negative aspect would be the ""not so simple language used"" I have an higher education and sometimes I would find myself spending few minutes on one sentence wondering what was the essence of it. But overall it's a shot of sunshine when you feel that your whole world is upside down!"
5,Profound Insight,"I don't know how Gary Zukav does it, but this book speaks to me like very few books ever have. I just read this book for the third time and I am reminded why Oprah loves this author so much. Every time I read it I find new meanings, new inspiration and new ways of looking at myself and my circumstances that help me grow as a person and be happier."
3,insightful..but full of half truths,I didn't know zukav was even on Oprah.. but i read the book anyway and being a practicing buddhist i found his thoughts and his philosophy to be filled with half truths..he gives a good explanation of karma.. but i disagree with his idea of the soul and personality ... it is the idea of personality and soul that we cling to that is the cause of suffering.. in eastern thought ..specifically buddhist thought.. there is no permenant soul.. in fact there is no-soul and no-self.. because everthing is impermenant and constantly changing. i found the book to be enlightening but he didn't grasp the nature of real truth...more specifically the four noble truths found in eastern buddhist thought.
1,Who says?,"Don't any of you who rated this 5 stars ever stop to say, ""Oh, yea? Who says?"" Even as one who is ""already indoctrinated into the received wisdoms of the New Age"" and one to whom much of Gary Zukav's theories sound reasonable, I can not take his total lack of support for what he posits. Not so much as a personal experience or reference to anything in the wisdom traditions. We have Guides and Teachers? Why not just Teachers, or Guides for that matter. Why not Junior and Senior Teachers, and Guides, Angels, and Fairies? Where did he come up with this stuff? ... I can't help thinking this would never had seen the light of day if it hadn't come from the Dancing Wu Li Master guy."
2,This book was a disappointment,"I bought Seat of the Soul from Amazon.com because of the many positive reviews and its popular acceptance, the author's reputation, and because it is in the same genre as a book that I wrote (The Road to Damascus.)I expected more of it. I am not critical of Zukav because of any personal belief system that clashes with his, nor is there any inherent animosity for the ideas that he proposes. My disappointment results from his pedantic, declarative style, in which he presents his proposals without providing reasoning or sources to support his statements, nor any attempt at persuasion. He simply makes his statements as fait accompli, sans justification or explication, which in such an important subject matter I find indefensible. I confess that I quit the book half-read, which is rare with me.Joseph Pierre,Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity"
4,hard read but worth it,This book will challenge you. It isn't the typical new age lovey dovey stuff. It makes you realize the responsibility of all your actions. How your pain doesn't justify you trying to pass it onto someone else. It is about evolution and truly will stick with you.
5,Inspirational!!!!,"This was exremely good news for me!!!I recommend it to everyone!!! Hopefully, their level of evolvement will grasp the wonderful message!!!"
4,Seat of the Soul,I love Gary Zukav and I like his book. It is very interesting. Sometimes I have to re-read sentences to better understand what he is saying but I gain that much more from it.
4,This book speaks to me,"I don't know how Gary Zukav does it, but this book speaks to me like very few books ever have. I just read this book for the third time and I am reminded why so many people love this author so much. Every time I read it I find new meanings, new inspiration and new ways of looking at myself and my circumstances that help me grow as a person and be happier. I also highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Wisdom"" by Taro Gold. Excellent!"
1,If only I could give zero stars.,"This book speaks less to the mind and more the sphincter. Another reviewer described why this book sucks when he/she said, ""It is not wisdom. It is not philosophy. It is not religion, and it is not science. It is nothing more than Mr. Zukav's ideas, written in a creative way that demonstrates his abilities in the English language far more than any gifts related to spirituality."" That about sums it up, though I'd not have used such kind words.This is typical New Age hippy-dippy bunkum and a waste of cognition. I can't believe there are sequels. To paraphrase a character from Happy Gilmore, ""Mr. Zukav, this book is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever read. At no point in your rambling, incoherent writing were you even close to anything resembling a rational thought. Everyone who has read this is now dumber for doing so. I award you no stars and may God have mercy on your soul."""
1,Unbelievable,"The book had a few points, but even for the open minded person regarding the subject it was missing some explanations, in other parts it was very repetious. Of course the author should be convinced of the topic, but to me this is still only one opinion or one theory how to look at it. I didn't care for his assumption concerning the animal soul, that animals have a group soul and dolphins committing suicide? All of the insights were stated too matter-of-factly. But what really put me over the edge and I can only hope Gary Zukav meant it differently, but I was shocked at the suggestion in the Karma section ""not to judge events like the inquisition, holocaust or the death of child, as we don't know what the arrangements are for these tortured souls as they might find healing in the process""....Therefore we should just relax when a loved one dies, with wars or situations like in Darfur, because these souls might experience redemption???? This concept goes against everything I believe in!!"
2,Misses the mark most of the time,"I had high hopes for some enlightenment when I first picked up this book. I soon realized it was too far ""out there"" for me. What struck me most often while reading was how generic and almost wishy-washy it seemed. I did enjoy portions of the book (mostly the aspects that relate to Mr. Zukav's knowledge of physics), but much of the time I found these were things that were more common sense than great revelation.This book is definately too ""new age religion"" for my liking."
5,Opens the mind and the heart - absolutely wonderful !,The human resistance to any new idea and change is clearly displayed in many comments about this book. The unknown is a fearful place. Seat of the Soul is a manual for those who are ready to take responsibility for their lives. Are you ready to take and enjoy the next step in human evolution?My deepest gratitude to Gary for his courage and wisdom to write such a wonderful book.
1,"Garbage in, Garbage out...","Pure mysticism trash. A cross between Dianetics and the Celistine Prophecy except this book doesn't even pretend to form a basis for any of the conclusions the Author draws. He just blurts them out and then tells you ""you must believe"". It would appear Mr. Zukav never asked himself ""why""... like ""why would I publish such garbage?"" Contradictions galore; they fall off the pages. Oh, and my favorite sentence from the ""book"": ""Our deeper understanding tells us that a truely evolved being is one that values others more than it values itself..."" pa-leeeeeze. Why? What ""deeper understanding""? How did you find this out? How do you know everyone else feels this way? Thinks this way? This quote is on page 21... and it only gets worse!"
1,Off target,"Unfortunately, Gary Zukav's pedantic personal style comes through in this writing as well as in his live interviews. When I actually sat down to read this book, I found that it was not at all what it claimed to be. It contained much more about religion and God than it did about personal discovery and development. In fact, I found most of the book filled with unfounded generalizations, none of which resonated with me in any way. The few useful ideas that this book contains are very deeply buried in rhetoric. Unless you want some pop theology, look elsewhere for enlightenment."
1,Disappointing,"Mr.Zukav's book reads like a college text book. It is very hard to get through and gives no new insights to the reader. The basic idea of do unto others as you would have them do unto you is the underlying advice. Why the author felt a need to write nearly 300 pages about it is my question. There is no personality to the writing, no backround to explain how he came to his conclusions about karma and evolution. This book was a complete disappointment and waste of money- hollow and worst of all very poorly written."
5,Quantum consciousness,"This book has to be read after understanding Zukav's first book ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"". Once you have mastered the mechanics of what he relates to you in that book, you will have a more profound grasp of what the seat of the soul really means. This is not some new age hocus pocus. It is written with deep spiritual awareness based on a lucid understanding of theoretical physics and quantum theory.Read, read this book over and over. It is one of the most enlightening books one will ever read. I categorise this book in the same bracket as Zohar's ""The Quantum Self"" and ""The Quantum Society"". In the quest to understand the relationship between Man and his place in the Universe, Zukav's first two books are of invaluable importance.Read,learn and experience."
1,This book is a crock,"There's not a single substantiated fact in the entire text. It's simply a set of assertions. If it's truth you see, look elsewhere. If you'd rather escape from reality, however, delve in, and fantasize your way to enlightenment."
1,Where's the meat?,"The subject matter intrigued me, however, the book lacked substance and discussed abstract and vague ideas without specific relavent examples."
1,This is a runaway best-seller??,"Someone, please explain to me what all the fuss is about for this book! Zukav's premise may be intriguing (however, not to me!), but what a chore to trudge through his clumsy, wordy writing!"
1,"Unfortunately, not the best towels, but a really good company!!","I was not satisfied with the quality of these towels as they were very thin and only printed on one side. However, their customer service is GREAT!!I called Andrew Christian directly and they were very helpful and accomodating in accepting the return and sharing the shipping costs. So, just because this paricular product was unsatisfactory, give these guys a shot! They are willing to work with you if you are not happy with what you get!Bad towel, good comapny!"
3,Not what I was looking for,"I found this item by searching Amazon for arts and crafts *supplies*, so it wasn't a big leap for me to think that it might include some actual arts and crafts *supplies*.Nope.Its a book of arts and crafts projects. I glanced through it and they looked fine except for assuming things like my access to a decent Xerox machine to copy a leaf pattern onto construction paper. I suspect this might be a great book for a preschool teacher with the resources of a school behind her. But for me just looking for an arts and crafts kit, it was pretty much a waste of money."
4,Not bad for Roseanne.,"It seems that since her tv show Roseanne has been lacking in her standup. Her old stuff was hilarious but then getting a cable tv show seemed to chang all that.Yet she is absolutely hilarious in this special. At times she seems to be too preachy with some of her material (namely the government) but since I see both sides of things it didn't bother me so much. A lot of her material was on the floor funny but some was just boring, unfunny and trying too hard to be witty and failing.Overall if you like her and her stuff and can laugh at a plethora of subjects, then watch this. If you can't take a joke at face value, stay away; it might offend you and your beliefs."
4,When weird works,Threadgill is that ultra-rare specimen of avant-garde jazz composer who displays such a commitment to pushing the boundaries of selfless experimentation that he puts nearly everyone else in his field to shame for shallow egotistical absorption.
4,Interesting,Having a family friend who is Irish and the family are dealing with a son who was just diagnosed with schizophrenia.This book had some interesting observations.This book was more a journey for answers than facts.Interesting.
4,Quest For Glory Series!,"This series is wonderful save one or two exceptions. The 5th in the series was not at all fun to play. They strayed from their already fabulous interface to a newer, harder 3D style. It lost some of it's glamour this way. Other than that I would highly recommend!"
5,Quest for Glory,"These games are pretty old, but they are the best games I ever played. They're so good that people have made a QFG 4.5 and are making 6 and 7. People are crazy about it."
4,It's a Fun Series But It Could've been more.,"This was a great series. The first One was by far the best (It got even better when Serria remade the first game). I only wished Serria gave you the chance to customize your own character type to go with the fighter/magic-user/thief classes. I did that purely by accident and it really brought a something unique to the character. Also, I wish the theif character was able to upgrade their weapon to a short sword instead of just being able to wield only a dagger. It was a good series, I just feel that Serria could've gone further with this series.But hey, If you can grab this series, grab it. It's good."
3,Definitely a half and half collection.,"This collection must get at least three stars despite the fact that two of the games it includes are among the worst adventure/RPG titles ever released by any company ever. The remaining games are really that good! The first two games in the series are truly spectacular, and fully display everything that is capable of the adventure gaming genre. (And, depending on the way you want to look at it, they demonstrate what all could be done with the ""limited"" resources of the late 1980s!) The last two games in the collection are abjectly horrid and should be avoided at any and all costs. Poorly written, implemented, and thought out, ignore them altogether, and get the collection entirely for the unequaled So You Want to Be a Hero? and Trial by Fire."
1,Don't send the wrong message,Great series of games. Old games. For one hundred and seventy freaking dollars? Come on folks. That's just absurd. There's plenty of other good games out there. Stop shelling big bucks for nostalgia and try something new for a change.
5,"Quest for Glory, The ultimate RPG","One of Sierra's best, a game series people from every genre of gaming will enjoy. This is the second Sierra game I owned, I had the original ""So you want to be a Hero?"" The challenge of having to think to win, not just hack and slash is the key to these games, games that challenge your mind, kick your adrenaline, and frequently, tickle your funny bone, I love these games, all of them, I hope you enjoy them as much as me."
4,A lively uplifting CD from one of today's great jazz artists,This CD has a great mixture of bouncing street tunes and soothing jazz. David Sanchez is surely one of the best young jazz musicians that I have heard. His music is wonderful without becoming pretentious and he never forgets his audience. He would provide a good introduction to jazz music.
4,"Adema's ""Shattered"" and Demos..","Ok, so this cd came out and I bought it, not for any of the songs or anything, because I allready have the song ""Shattered"" from the import album, and well the demo songs, I have on the Adema ""3 Class A Demos"" tape, that was availble for a short time, overseas to the readers of a famous magazine. The demo songs on the cd howerver are edited, they dont say the bad words, which on the tape I have they do..I know not a big deal, but some people out there are well picky. I would say the video of ""Giving In"" is well worth the price of the single alone. I gave the cd 4 stars because, it did not include the rumored ""roll call"" that had the names of the people that voted for the demo songs(2 out of 3 made it on the cd)."
1,Pointless,"Forget this. Two of three tracks can be found on the Insomniacs dream EP. The demo of ""Blow it away"" is horrible. The video of ""Giving In"" is kind of cool but that can be found on the Mediocre ""Insomniacs Dream"" as well.Giving In(radio mix) Where is it different than the original?If you can find one difference E-mail me.Shattered- Actually one of Adema's better songs. It should've been on the full length. But... you can get it on ""Insomniacs dream""Blow it Away(demo)- horrible. Adema should be a full time studio band. They aren't really good live either.Giving In Video- Cool but you can get it on the ""Insomniacs Dream EP""First get the Full Length Self titled debut(its pretty good). Then if you have some extra cash, maybe consider getting Insomniacs Dream. Don't waste your money here."
3,Must not be the only book about networking you have,"This book brings uncountable information not only about network operating systems, but also about network hardware. It is very easy to be read. But if you really want to learn about networks, this must not be the only book to buy, of course. Since it is written in an easy language, it can be read not only by the ones who already works with networking, but also by the ones who are willing to enter this field."
4,Great glove for beginning students,"Got this glove for my 12 year old son - a beginning fencer. Just slightly big on an average 5'4"" boy. But worked great. Wonderful and comfortable protection for his level of the sport."
2,It's the one book I couldn't get through.,"I read Halldor Laxness' Independent People and loved it so much that I ordered all the out of print books by him I could find-- and The Atom Station, conveniently in print and available through Amazon Books. I hated ""Station."" I put it down 1/3 of the way through and have felt no need to pick it up. This is the first time I can remember doing this in a lifetime of compulsive reading. Laxness experimented with a new style in this one-- demonstrating that experiments sometimes fail. I found his parody obnoxious, his politics overwhelming, the characters unengaging, and the tone of the book irritating. I gave it a ""3"" because its not pulp-- it's intelligent. Original. Unusual. Maybe someone will like it. He's really a great writer!!!"
1,Dreadful drivel,This has to be one of the worst books I've ever read!. I can't believed I finished it. I set it aside many times and felt that it had to get better so I finally finished it. What a waste of time! It's dialogue was so stilted and unbelievable. The main character is so cold and restrained and she is suppose to be so intellectual. She supposedly didn't even know that the 'witness protection agency' was real; she thought it was a 'made for tv' concept.I think the author should stick to her day job. Although I shudder to think she might be teaching my daughter in her college years.And what was with her political agenda being pushed in one paragraph half way through the book? It had nothing to do with the story and just seemed to be so out of place.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one! There are so many better books out there.
1,Flat and affected,"My mother gave me this book because I love mysteries, I was an English major, and I live in Manhattan. She thought I would enjoy reading about a Manhattan mystery from a feminist perspective. However, given the utter lack of description of Manhattan or its characters, the book I read could have taken place in a dark box. I'm not sure why Cross even bothered describing a trip to the lovely Frick Museum, she certainly didn't transport me there or give me any sense of what the museum holds.I also felt the notion that Cross doesn't describe ANYTHING as a tip of the hat to her protagonist Kate(who doesn't notice her surroundings) as a one-note tune at best. It made the novel boring, boring, boring. So boring in fact, that I couldn't finish the novel. And I'll reading finish almost anything."
3,Final Novel,"Though better than the previous novel in the Kate Fansler series (that is, Honest Doubt), The Edge of Doubt lacks some of the cleverness of the best of the series, such as The James Joyce Murder; Sweet Death, Kind Death; and Poetic Justice. Readers do discover that Kate's birthday is in 1950. Her oldest of three brothers, Laurence, appears just as obnoxious as he is in earlier novels (particularly No Word from Winifred).No one dies in the narrative present of this novel. Kate's investigation, if it qualifies as detecting, involves trying to discover more about the man who shows up to prove that he is her biological father. The circumstances of the plot do allow Kate to reflect on her views of the ""nature versus nurture"" argument."
2,Boring read.,"This book was rather boring, i waited for something interesting to happen throughout the whole book, sadly nothing came."
5,The Best Love CD in a long time....,"This CD offers so much insight and love... his voice is so smooth and mellow. I just wish I knew how to get hold of this CD... I wish I knew how to get more music from this man. He definitely was not given his just due as a great musical artist. I hope somewhere, somehow, he can hear that he has fans out there and will give us a second CD."
5,Slept on Talent !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased Frankie back in 1997. I don't know how promotions are done or what goes into getting a record played, but there has been a crime commintted in the world of music! What was the purpose of getting this guy in the studio, pressing a disk, and NOT playing it? This CD is BLAZING hot!!!! This is REAL music. This is a ""must"" cop for your R&B/Soul collection! This CD needs to be re-released. Frankie, along with others, have been dissed! Please don't let GOOD music like this continue to be passed by!"
5,Can I Give it 10 STARS????,Where do I begin...I must've been the FIRST person to cop this CD in 97. I grabbed it the day it was released because the store manager at Willie's Records in Durham NC said it was a hit and I still play it in 2005. I have said on NUMEROUS message boards that this was the sleeper hit of the 20th Century. This man should go SUDDENLY platinum and the word should be spread to just buy this cd. His voice is so sultry and the beats are so relaxing. He needs to re-release this thing IMMEDIATELY! Apparently we are preaching to the choir because you would have to know he exists to even be reading this review! A&R people if you are reading RE-RELEASE FRANKIE!!!!!!!
5,The Most Slept-On Album of 1997,"I got this album from a distributor who worked for the label passing out promos of new artists. So I played it at home one night and was blown away. every track was hittin all switchesmy favorites If I had You and Dear Love played more than once.Frankie is an artist that should have gotten more publicityand airplay cause this is a classic piece of music. What happendto his A&R; people on this one there should have been more from him. If you don't have it, get it!!!"
5,You don't know nothing bout this!,& that's because it's the most slept on. This album is HOT!!!!!! If you're an R&B appreciator you will definitely love this album! I guarantee your satisfaction ta hell with Amazon guaranteeing it.
5,What Can I say?,"This is maybe my 5th copy of this cd since it was released in 96-97. For some reason it always ends up disappearing. But I love Frankie and this album... Classic album...truly timeless music. He never got the exposure he deserved. I wish he would have hung in there, he would have been a great artist."
4,Frankie,"I have been searching for this CD for years. I had the album since it's release in 1997 and it was lost, stolen, who knows? I love it! I can say that real R&B died in the 90's. I don't know why Frankie never became a bigger success? If you are a fan of 90's R&B, then please proceed to checkout. Chucky Thompson, do I really need to say more? He was and is one of the greatest R&B producers of all time. He is easily sitting up there with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. You are not wasting your money with this one. Frankie, if you're reading, please come back! Music needs you!"
5,WOW,"It is very rare to purchase an album and fall in love with EVERY song on the album. I can only remember it happening to me once, and that was when I purchased Frankie's ""My Heart Belongs to You"". With most albums the songs become bareable after hearing them several times. These songs, however, were loved the first time I laid ears on them. It has been 6 years since I purchased this album and it has stayed in my CD changer's rotation since. I came to Amazon hoping Frankie had dropped another album, that I hadn't heard about. I was definitely ready to snatch it if he had. I hope he's somewhere putting together another colaboration of great songs. You'll always have a fan in me!"
4,Real Good/Feel Good,I ordered My Heart Belongs to you off of a fellow Amazonian after listening to samples. I wasn't disappointed to say the least. The album only received four stars from me due to the fact Frankie was seemingly held back on some songs(although not his fault). You can actually hear where his strengths lay like on track #9 which is an interlude. While it's true he doesn't possess the strongest voice it compliments the music on his album. I myself must agree with other reviewers in wonder of how he hasn't or isn't releasing more material as oppossed to less talented artist. Frankies vocals and beats are real good and his taking a page back to simplicity in his lyrics make it a feel good album. It's an overall pop it in the changer and mellow or make out joint. Pretty good for a first leap out into the copycat world that has been R&B for the past six or so years.
5,Love it!,I had this album years ago and was upset when it came up missing. So happy to have it again...this album is everything!Thank you :-)
1,Don't buy,"Don't buy this brush. The picture shows a brush with an oval shaped brush head and the product description states that the brush has an oval head. IT DOES NOT.The old GripSoft pin brush for dogs did have an oval shaped head and they were wonderful. We have used them for years on our Golden Retrievers. But, of course, the manufacturer couldn't leave a good design alone. Now the brush comes with a round brush head which is not as efficient and covers less of the dog's coat with each sweep of the brush. Far inferior to the previous design. We ordered two, but sent them back to Amazon when we opened the box and saw the new design."
1,waste of money,This dog brush started falling apart within days of use. totally unusable after two months. the pins would get pushed into the rubber.save money look elsewhere.
4,Standard Quality Brush,Very standard dog brush. It has a quality handle and does a good job pulling off dead hair and making my pup look gorgeous.
5,LOVED IT,"I have three of these books, this one, the one from 30 day gourmet, and the Don't Panic book. This was by far the best. It's the only one that divides the recipes into sessions, giving you a grocery list at the beginning of each section of what you'll need for all 5 recipes (though you could very easily just pick one to make, but this layout gives you the option of making several at one time.) The other two are just a compilation of freezer friendly recipes. There is a great variety of recipes, and they all look wonderful. I can't wait to try them! It is written in an easy-to-understand way, and the recipes aren't too complicated either. I am very happy with this book!!!"
2,Big disappointment,"This book was a BIG disappointment. The idea of cooking many things at once was well explained and the shopping lists and procedures were very helpful. However, more than fifty percent of the recipes were over 400 calories a serving with 9 or more grams of fat. In my opinion, these are not ""lowfat"" recipes as advertised on the cover."
2,"Like the concept, but recipes are not great","I am not new to cooking for the freezer, but I bought this book for some new recipes. Unfortunately, my family and I simply don't like the recipes in this book. I've tried about six of these recipes, and we didn't like any of them. In fact, one of these recipes was inedible. I will not be keeping this cookbook.However, I do like the concept of making different meals around a single kind of meat, and will be incorporating that idea into my cooking. There is also some good information on freezing times, what foods freeze well, etc. However, much of this information is in other freezer cooking cookbooks, so I wouldn't buy this cookbook for that info alone."
3,"Good, but not for everyone","I picked up a copy of this book at the library because I wanted to see if I could save time and money by making meals in bulk. Being a vegan, I eat a lot of stirfrys, beans, lentils, soups and stews and I thought it would be easy to substitute some ingredients for the non-vegan ones. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The book suggested that you can make the recipes vegetarian by using TVP or tofu but it just doesn't work. So if you're not a vegetarian/vegan this book would be perfect for you."
3,Its a so so cookbook.,"I would not reccomend this to be your sole source for oamc recipies. Its good to have on as an addition, but to basic for me. It is very difficult to cook with, it is not hard back or spiral. Its paperback. There are better oamc resources out there."
2,mush soup,"I was impressed when reading through this book, especially with the tips in the begininning. Then I picked one recipe to make for a supper swap. I was making this for 6 families! I shopped and cooked and 3 hours later all the meals were in the freezer. Then I baked one for my family for supper. The recipe (chicken broccoli noodle bake) called for way too much water, which made it soupy. Then I baked it for the recommeded time and when we were eating it we realized that the egg noodles had gotten too soft and made a mushy mess in the bottom of the baking dish. So it was now a mushy soup with chunks of chicken and broccoli. Both my husband and I felt sick after eating it. Now I have 6 meals of this in my freezer that I don't dare bring to the supper swap and I'm back at square one!!! Let's try editing before going to press next time, Deborah!"
1,Disappointing,"If you are already familiar with the idea of cooking for a day, and eating for a week or month, then you will likely be disappointed with this bland and boring cookbook. The best recipes in it are uninspired versions of spaghetti sauce, chili, and casseroles. These are all concoctions that you probably already have recipes for, and could just double and freeze. This cookbook also needs serious editing. The author repeats recipes in several sections, and often has inaccurate measurements for her ingredients. Save yourself some money and buy a traditional cookbook instead."
5,breathtaking scope and gorgeous detail,"Hinks borders on absolute genius, taking his reader far and wide (and into!) literature's most breathtakingly emmersive environments: full of wonder, intrique and adventure. A hero for our new age, an age of intellectual and emotional darkness and confusion, but never have I felt so assured, so comfortable as I am in the Hands of Hink! Bravo maestro!"
5,Doesn't anybody like the book Animorphs these days?!,"Not to make you think I'm weird, but yes, I read these ""crummy"" little books. To tell you the truth, I think anyone who doesn't like Animorphs is weird (doesn't anyone like K.A. Applegate's books these days?). So people out there who want to read the book Animorphs, whatever you do (even if it means getting a Yeerk infested in your head), DON'T TRUST THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE (did I say don't like? I meant hate.) THE BOOK ANIMORPHS!!! Anyways, I've gotta stop being picky. I love the book Animorphs, and I recommend it to all worldwide readers!"
3,"Typical and predictictable, but entertaining","This book is pretty typical of the animorphs series. It does have a few plot twists, but overall is pretty predictable, you can see the end coming a mile away. The animorphs series has been fun, but there are only so many times something can be done before it gets boring. I hope applegate brings some sort of an end to the series before it runs out of steam."
1,Gimme a break,"when our bud Applegate first started making these books, they were cool, action-packed, and realistic. Now she writes one lame book after another. They get increasingly far-fetched and thinner. They are also repetive. I mean, come on. Sorry all you fans, but this book isnt all that."
1,Unwatchable,"Ripping yarns, but the picture quality is so bad as to make these discs almost unwatchable - and I'm not a super picky video nut."
2,"Great stuff, let down by poor transfer","Yes these are great adventures, but the transfer is poor. What concerns me more is that no longer can I rely on these reviews to tell me the true quality of the DVD. I don't understand why some people are claiming such high quality video, unless they have their own agenda. Two stars because they are great adventures."
5,Sharpes' Rifles Forever!!,"I first viewed this Amazing Series, when I was living in my home, in Wales, United Kingdom. I am a British Subject, as well as American.In Britian at the time the whole of the Kingdom was absolutly hooked on [Our] Richard Sharpe and his Chosen Men. Like in this country, all waited each year for {Soprano's etc]. For Sharpe and his chosen men.Well, I returned to the USA and to my utter delight, I saw on BBC American they were going to show the Sharpe series in full. You [Yanks] as we Brits call the Americans had never seen or heard of Sharpe's Rifle's! I called all my friend and family, screaming my delight. Watch this!!Bottom line, quite a few are hooked. and have bought all the series DVD's.My review's total opinion, is that it is everybit as good as ""GLADIATOR"", which to me is the greatest movie ever. I've seen many in my 70 years.CHEERS!!SIA"
4,A new life for Sharpe,"Richard Sharpe is on DVD, and better than ever! Sharpe's Rifle's, the first in the series of Sharpe films made for BBC television and aired on Masterpiece Theater in the U.S. is an exciting starting point for people who are not familiar with the brilliant series of novels by Bernard Cornwell. It is also a great showcase for the talents of Sean Bean, who we will see more of next year in The Lord of the Rings. The movie follows Lieutenant Richard Sharpe, a British soldier during the Napoleonic wars, as he takes command of a rifle company and sends whole bunches of Frenchies to their graves. Action galore and interesting period detail. Fans of the book series may be suprised at the early appearance of Teresa in ""Rifles"" (in the books she doesn't show up until ""Sharpe's Gold"") but fear not! It won't ruin the story for you. I hope these four DVD's are only the begining, as there are ten movies in all. This price is unbelieveable too!"
4,"Great show, picture quality should be improved","The show is great, the main character is a loveable rogue played by Sean Bean, not sure anyone else would have done it justice. The DVD quality is a little grainy though, i wish it was on BlueRay or at least better quality."
4,Good solid historical adventure,"The acting, costuming and scenes are very good.I learned something about the British Napoleonic wars that I didn't knowin the war in Spain. The action is a little grittyand graphic at times, but it is a war movie.I enjoyed it the first time I saw it and plan to watch it again now thatI know more about that time period.I have to say that I wish there were more suchmovies that teach while they entertain."
3,not as good as the book,"I thought it was pretty good for the first one, but not near as good as the book. I think I will try some of the later Sharpe DVDs and hopefully they will be a little truer to the books."
5,"Holy Moley! Agent Aika, hot as ever, is at it again!","Man! I can't get enough of this chick! This movie brings the best of Agent Aika to you! Just like the last video, Naked Mission, Agent Aika is sure to give more interesting camera angles to you. Loved this movie, excellent mix of hot chix and clever drama!"
2,A Japanime feature with a naughty camera,"The first thing I noticed when I watched this film was reoccurance of ""panty shots"" that don't seem to fit in any way except for sexual spice. For example; in a scene where a woman is guiding a tour on a boat, the view suddenly switches momentarily to an angle that looks up her skirt at her underwear.Anyway, the plot is unoriginal (a couple of spy girls investigate some weirdo organization) and the story seems to drag (some scenes take too long). It IS interesting though, so I do recommend renting it. Just don't buy it until you know what you're getting into (no pun intended)."
4,More of the same,"This video is pretty much just like the first Aika title, Naked Mission. There are women's panties all over the place and the occassional nudity. The story is ripped right out of Moonraker. There's a villain bent on destroying the world and repopulating it with his own children, which he will father with the chicks he brought into space with him. It's fairly funny, particularly the character Gusto, who has one of the most interesting voices I've heard on anime. If you liked the first one or like anime with lots of babes, this is a good pick."
3,Definitely fetish material,"It's all about fan service. The camera angles, ship designs, and costume designs revolve around one goal...showing white cotton panties. It has no other goal. Agent Aika succeeds because it single-mindedly sticks to its gameplan and executes it. Do not buy this if you want a story. This is strictly a fan service disc. There's no sex here, just T&A (and a grope). It's wierd. It's cute and sick all at the same time. I enjoyed it for what it was."
4,This is NOT Hentai... but close,"First off, This isn't Hentai, but its so close it's sickening. (In a funny way) The plot is abolutly horrid, but I bought it for the fan service. You should too. The show starts and ends with a blatent shot of underwear and while watching it, a minute dosen't pass before you catch another few glimpses. It's a fantasy world where all women are beautiful and wear white thongs. It's almost sureal. Lets just say It's almost impossible to sit down and count them all. Of course it's got endless replay value whenever you just want to see some fan service, and it's great to show to your friends. If your looking for a story though, look else where cause that isin't Aika's cup of tea."
4,wow goldfinger on japan!!!,"this is a james bond kind of story and if your into the panty stuff you will absolutly love this one , it is very funny so if you like pantys and the spy kind of story this one is for you"
3,"so bad, it turns into comedy","A little bit more plot to resolve the story, but still not much. The real star of the show is underwear, especially panties.Yet more exploitive angles and fighting choreography always maximizing pantie visibility. Just how many ways can they display women's panties. Totally absurd and hilarious. What's with the guys that created this thing? They must have some serious fetishes!Two sorts of people will enjoy this tape:(1) Fanboys into this sort of thing (you know who you are)(2) People into parodies."
3,A story underneath all those panties......,"Believe or not, this is a pretty enjoyable piece of Anime even if you are not into panties and spanking. And don't be fooled by the title, there are plenty of ""bouncing boobies"" and ""flashing panties"" but they don't bust out of any bras or blouses (sorry fellas).Still, there is plenty of action and super-hero styled fight scenes for non-sex addicts. The animation is pretty good too."
5,Action babes with bodies that kill,I got this vidoe I didn't even wait to eat before I watch it. Not even 2 minutes into the movie there was an upskirt panty shot. The story was great. The second episode is killer. There is always pantys being shown in every frame. I felt dirty whatching it. Get this movie if you love women and anime. Aika is hot in and out of cloths. And so is her partner Rion.
5,Hot chicks and action all the way!,"This video is the excellent combination of cute anime chicks and action! Their hot bodies keep the ""plot"" going all through the film! I'm going to buy the next one ""Lace in Space"" now!!"
1,I couldn't make it work either,"I have this software, and I couldn't make it work. I am using it with OS X, and it will do the first full backup, but just quits when I try to do any subsequent backups. I talked to customer service and they had me download an update, but that didn't work either!"
1,does not work,The 30 day demo worked fine but the program did not work and I wasn't able to get a refund!
1,Expecting more,"I thought this was the same as what I'd seen someone reading at the airport ... this was a tiny slice of it, and actually not worth the cost. I'd like to find the full version somewhere."
2,Not what you might expect,"The first SV album offered beats galore: Native Tongue stylings (Hold Tight), party jams (What's it all about), and stuff you could bump in your jeep (Players, Get Dis Money). Well, Jay Dee is surely missing in this set. ""Trinity"" is boring. ""Tainted"" is the only joint worth listening to (and it's not just because it's ""radio-friendly""). The production outside of that stellar cut is redundant. There are no breaks, bridges, or changes of pace in any other songs. The flows are OK but cannot overcome the poor production and generic musicality. Bottom line: if you like The Roots, A Tribe Called Quest, Common, or previous Slum Village records, you will NOT like this album. Outside of ""Tainted,"" it is NOTHING like their last album..."
2,One tight Jam the rest is a Snorefest,"""Tainted"" is one of the Best Jams I've Heard all year.I've even told a Buddy of Mine that song is the Best Song that the Roots will never do unless they prove me wrong with there Next Album7Future Releases? but anyway after Tainted it gets boring fairly quickly.there are a few moments here&there but overall not worth buying the Whole Album.I was looking to hearing this Set after they Hit so hard with ""Tainted"" but oh well."
4,"TRINITY... YOUR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE...","A MUSIC FAN FROM LYNNWOOD doesnt know what hes speakin on!Fantastic Vol. 2 was not Slum Villa's first lp but second, Fantastic Vol. 1 (although it wasnt on a major) was they're first lp.TRINITY offers a new (maybe polished ESS VEE) but if you were feelin VOL.2, you will definitely be feelin Trinity. Standouts for me are: ""Star"", ""Slumber"", ""Disco"" (peep Elzhi's verse, as he flips titles from trax on Fantastic Vol.2!) and of course ""Tainted"" (maybe SV's smoothest joint since ""2U4U"").COP IT!And hey! Alla y'all need ta jump offa the ""SV without JAYDEE"" hatin bandwagon!"
5,SLUM VILLAGE IS HERE TO SAVE HIP-HOP!,"Amid the barrage of garbage that currently spews from the orifices of Hip-Hop rises Slum Village again: 3 innovative MC's accompanied by an army of producers of the highest order are going places and taking Hip-Hop with them. Their percussive rhyming over melodic basslines and sharp snares combine to form great Hip-Hop and even better music. Indeed, Slum Village is here to save hip-hop."
1,Extreme Trash,"You have no idea how pissed I am about this cd being as wack as it is. The rhyming is elementary, the lyrics are simple-minded, and judging from ""Tainted"", I thought I was going to get some unique, bob-ya-head music but this whole cd is a disgrace."
2,Dissapointing,"Aart from 1 or two tracks, one at the most (Tainted - and even then it get annoying), cop the bootleg!"
1,Every other 'word' is the 'N' word - Tragic Trash,Another tragic release using the 'N' word to masquerade as art. Feeding Black youth this garbage only increases Black self-hate.
3,not much to say here,"I bought this thinking these guys were innovative yet nothing on this cd stands out to me. tainted feat dwele is the best song on the cd , maybe that's why it was the first single. one thing I dislike about this is the skits, interludes , and for crying out loud 2 intros!!! why do you need two intros? there are about 4 good tracks out of 22 the rest are a bit bland if your looking for something new or different don't look here , I'm sure they'll do better next time or atleast I hope they will. not the second coming of tribe sorry."
1,"If it's not broke, don't fix it.","This album was a disappointment. The first single was just a tease, to reel you, but overall it's defintely no Fantasic vol. 2. Jay-Dee, pleeeeeeease come back. They need you."
4,...YEAH!!!,"what can i say. been a fan since they started out. the j-88 album, the fantastic album, jay-dee's welcome 2 detroit, are all smashes, i didn't understand the filler of last months ""dirty district"" but was relieved when i got this one last night. the unorthodox sound of jay-dee is gone but just on 3-4 cuts, but hey T-3 takes over where they left off. gotta love their style, it's unlike anything thats out right now. its kinda hard to compare this one to ""fantastic Vol II"" since they're both unique in their own way. it's a must get"
5,Clarity and true guidance.. with a transmission force,"Dr Bahram Elahi's books are real books as they care a power of sincerityand honnesty that connects to the Soul.Dr Bahram Elahi 's detailed explainations about spiritual matters areincredibly inspiring.I recommend all his books. Especialy ""The path of perfection"" as a start.One should be alert to the force that flows through his writings and not getcaught on the details of his theory at first. His theory makes much senseand could challenge certain ideas and concepts.... read open minded witha free heart....and you will feel clearly that Dr Bahram Elahi knows whathe talks about . His writtings care a humility well blended with strenght,proving his authentic spiritual background and experience."
3,Nice Dylan cover...,"I haven't had the pleasure of listening to the rest of the album, but I have heard Bills Version of ""Gonna haveta serve somebody"" on WBGO multiple times and liked it immensely. If the rest is as good as the cover,its well worth the buy.Will say I like hearing Bill live more than in-studio, saw him play up in Goshen NY a while back, he rocked the house!"
2,Disappointing Blues !,"Sorry, Bill!Poor lyrics and only fair production have made this a most disappointing purchase. The guitar playing is adequate, but not good enough to save this material. I hope Bill spends a little more time on the thought process before bringing out his next material."
3,Decent Trek,"Here There Be Dragons is, like most good Trek novels, a quick and painless read with some memorable moments. The plot is in some ways reminiscent of A Call to Darkness, with Enterprise crewmembers enslaved in a medieval setting. There's simply not much more to say about the book than that . . . ."
3,Here there be dragons,This book provides plenty of action but it lacks the realism to entrance you in the story. The characters are well done and the action is good but it's definitely not something you would go out of your way to read
3,"decent, but not great","interesting writing, easy to read. Story not so great...some of the predicaments the crew got into were interesting and graphically mature/dark (unlike the show). Too many subplots, it was the first time in my life I actually skipped sections... like Worf being mad he couldn't go down to the planet was boring and had no point."
4,happy camper,"i was delighted with the speed in which the book arrived, i knew before i purchased the book it was used so the small tear in the front cover only slightly detracked from the other wise immaculate book."
4,Clever,"The stories are extremely short, cunning, and witty - great for children and adults. Ms. Babbitt includes hilarious puns that are well placed throughout the book. The sentences are simple to read and the moral or ending of each story is amusing. My most favorite is the last one, ""The Power of Speech"". In general, no matter which species one belongs to - humans, animals, devils - one should always consider the consequences of one's actions and words."
4,Tempering the One Critique on this Page,"Admittedly, I have not read this book, but I have read a number of Goldhill's essays on Greek tragedy, published in a variety of journals and collections. Goldhill is a fine scholar. He is certainly not the most readable, but few classicists are. While I cannot guarantee that this book is excellent or easy, I find it improbable (in the extreme) that it is wholly poor, certainly not to the extent that the reviewer above implies."
3,Okay tape,"This tape is okay. It contains the 3 cartoons:Wacky WabbitA Corny ConcertoFalling HareAround 20-30 minutes.The quality of the cartoons are pretty good. The Wacky Wabbit has slightly muffled sound but the picture is pretty good, A Corny Concerto has clear sound and good picture, and Falling Hare is slowed down a slight bit and the picture is about the same as The Wacky Wabbit.Your average Public Domain tape.3 out of 5 stars."
3,How do you turn OFF an alarm?,"This pillbox is not the easiest one to fill. The end compartments interfere with the ability of the abutting compartments to open. Additionally, while it is easy to set the alarms, I have no idea how to cancel one. I had to set two of them to the same time to stop the second alarm (of four) from sounding. Still, it does help me to take my meds every day which is the reason I purchased it."
1,Alarm loudness.,The product is well made at a reasonable price. Elderly people will have difficulty hearing the very low high pitched alarm. Unfortunately we will not be able to use it.
3,Did not do as I requested,"The product is just as stated, I have not had a medication accident since I recieved the turtles. I bought two one for day and one for night pills.However before I ordered I e-mailed the seller and asked them to make sure the two would be distinctly differant colors so I would be able to easily tell them apart. They replied no problem. I was sent a green and a blue that, unless they are under bright light, I can not tell the difference.I do worry this could lead to errors in the future."
3,Defective Panel,"The pill box ""alarm"" works great, but one of the pill box doors broke in a day or so... Kinda weak plastic, other than that it works good..."
4,Helpful,"I bought this item for my wife's father, he take a lot of pills everyday, so I thought this item will organize his time cure, he got so happy with this item"
2,Don't waste your time on this one.,"In a nutshell, all of the information in this book I had already learned from other sources while growing up (and, no, I'm not a salesmen and neither were any of my teachers). For the terminally uninformed, this would probably be a good book; for anyone else it would be a waste of money. This book is Not Recommended."
1,The most disappointing experience in my life,Why waste my time on writing a review for this stupid book. The content of this book is of a very low quality and the stories are not supprising at all. Maybe the stories in this book are eye openers for Americans but for Europeans certainly not.
4,Cephalopod Behaviour,This is a great book for researchers or natural history fans. Finally a book which describes cephalopod behaviour and not just neurobiology. Great content in an easy to read manner. Good pictures & behavour photos and a large section of references.
3,A serious source for the seriously interested in cephalopods,"This book really isn't for everyone. Only the seriously interested in cephalopods should attempt to read it. But if you are interested in cephs and you have a good scientific background, there's a ton of interesting information in here. These are fascinating animals and the more you know about them, the more fascinating they are. Who knew that nautilus have 90 tentacles? Who knew that along with their obvious chromatophores, cephalopods also have reflecting cells and all kinds of interesting bioluminescence? But how do they really communicate? Are they as smart as they seem? There is so much that isn't known! At least according to this book that was last updated in 2002. Makes me wonder how much new information is available."
4,Lots of fun,"This game really takes you back to the wild west. It haseverything; a town drunk, crooked mayor, saloon/brothel, card sharks,and Billy the Kid. I held back from the 5th star because . . . the underworld level is kind of boring. Everything before it is great, though. I would definately recommend this game if you're looking for an entertaining trip to the wild west."
1,This game blows!,"I agree with this much: the western genre is fascinating and wish there were more games with this premise. However, when I bought it I didn't realize how horribly dated and poorly executed this game is. The performances are nothing short of terrible. In fact, it's obvious the makers didn't use real actors, and may have actually done the voices themselves. I don't understand why everyone is giving this game 4 and 5 stars, but then again, I haven't finished it, so it may have some redeeming qualities. If you're looking for a good period-piece adventure game, you shoud spend the extra $ and get Grim Fandango."
4,better teachers than i am...,"l bought these books to give to my little nephew for christmas. we are now well grown out of berenstein bears' books, but my children and i remember them well! the kids loved them because, among other things, they were a longish and satisfying read with mom or dad, not a quickie, but a book with a real story, particularly effective for delaying bedtime with a long book. all the books teach and some of the lessons still echo down the years. 'messy build-up' has kept the kids' rooms fairly tidy for years. manners? well, manners pave the way in life like few other things and are so critically important. junk food? there's an important message to teach about junk food and we needed all the help we could get with reinforcing it. we have a foot high stack of the berenstein books upstairs, carefully tucked away for the next generation. it is such a pleasure to buy them and give them as truly valuable gifts."
1,terrible message,I am such a huge fan of these books and movies but i tossed this one in the trash! it has the worst message ever. rather than talking about how healthy food gives you more energy and to enjoy everything in moderation it taks about the cubs being fat and that is the reason they should eat better. So far this is the only bear book i have absolutely hated. total disappointment.
1,Berenstain bears and to much junk food,This book is kinda like a lesson for kids about having a clean room.You and your thing should always be organized
4,"Good story, but a bit long-winded for younger kids","The story is great, and the message is even better. However, the story itself is too long and drawn out for a kid under 5 or 6 to sit through successfully, in my opinion. At one point, they Bear's doctor starts to go into the anatomy of the human body, which was a bit confusing and too much information for my three year old. She sat through the book, and we've read it multiple times, but I can tell that she does not comprehend the information being given at times, and often loses focus."
2,Well intentioned but...,"While I am a firm believer in healthy eating for kids, I was disturbed that this book seems to emphasize appearance as the primary motivation for avoiding junk food. The family decides it's had enough when the children start looking ""chubby."" While obesity is certainly a big problem in the U.S., so is anorexia and bulimia and too much emphasis on a skinny body. Maybe I'm being overly-sensitive, but I really cringed when reading this book (which I fortunately only took out from the library) to my 4-year-old daughter. I'm glad we'll be taking this one back soon."
1,A book on strategy from a non-strategist,The author is a young physics professor with absolutely no credentials in military affairs or international relations. He is an enthusiastic activist for leftist causes and this is an amusing polemnic from a non-expert. But why would you want to pay for that?
3,Some good points,"I just finished this book tonight. A few other reviewers mentioned ""over-written"" and ""pretentious"". I agree. It's too bad that the author got so intrusive, because it's a great concept for a story. The psychological inferences were very insightful, sometimes brilliant. His sense of mood and place were wonderfully visual. I'm a push-over for a great metaphor, but too many get in the way of a fluid read. The build to the finale was well-paced, but the end was kind of a let down."
1,Disturbing Boredom,I had to force myself to read through the first couple of chapters and I had to force myself to continue reading the rest. The story was unconstructed and lacked any type of plot. Although the subject was a disturbing boy that seemed to get lost in the confusion and the lack of direction in the novel. This is one of the worst books I have ever read.
4,Haunting and smart,A great read. Murr creates some of the most believable and complex characters I've read about in a first novel.
2,Not a good psychological thriller,I thought the outline on the inside cover of the book was more interesting than the book itself.
2,Part 3 for Universal Soldier The Return part1 on Universal Soldier The Return DVD reviews 4.5/10,BTW part 2 of this review is on Jean Claude Van Damme triple feature vol 2. Before I ended part 2 I said Goldberg provided the laughs oh that's the problem there's too much comedy Goldberg in 1 scene is kicking @$$ then he uses the spear 1 of his rasslin' moves LMAO. Every time Van Damme foils him he says I hate that guy or when Van Damme escapes in a truck Goldberg jumps off a building & says OH s*!*! WTF!? Were they trying to film a kids movie? I'm sorry but Erin was Veronic Roberts version 2 they tried to recreate the Luc Veronica relationship from part 1. The Sub plot with Hillary being kidnapped should've been the main plot. Just rip off Commando have all out action cause the action was great fight scenes the use of heavy & death metal during shoot outs was good stuff. But this was a p!$$ poor sequel.
4,"Thoroughly listenable, entertaining record","You might not have heard of them, but if you want to hear of them, buy this one first...it is there most recent and best, followed closely by their self-titled debut sub-pop record. Worth your money."
1,Waste?Yes -,"I think Pond is one of the worst band ever existed.Their sound is very commercial.This is the negative side of Grunge Music - band like Hazel,Sprinkler,Pond,Dharma Bums,Gnome,etc. - bands for MTV kids.You can give 2/5 and 2/5 to the first two albums by Pond,but this is really disgusting."
4,Your star does not shine so bright,"This is an odd coloring book. There are outlines of playing cards inside. You decide to place your own face over that of the Queen because you are, of course, royalty. Just ask your mother. She thinks the world of her little girl, and spoils you with all the crayons you want, and larger-than-life dreams, and a puppy.Years go by and the colors in the coloring book fade. So do the colors in your eyes. And your aspirations. And your natural hair color. Addiction is no prettier in real life than it is in the movies. You were the golden girl, but that was the past. Your sister turned out so much better.The first song on ""Rock Collection"" is called ""Spokes"". It tears you right down the middle of that emotional divide between expectation and disappointment. It is not for the faint of heart. Nor is the rest of the album. Sometimes we need the darkness to see the light because we are all flawed, yet beautiful. Listen with caution and with an open mind."
5,Certainly worth a spin...,"Sadly, this was Pond's last offering although many would argue their best. It's too bad they were virtually unknown outside of thier rabid fanbase, because this one was of Sub Pops true rock gems. This release has everything that Pond was known for - great musicianship, incredible song writing, catchy riffs and beautiful melodies. They were lumped in between grunge and post-punk/emo, but certainly take a listen for yourself. Their self titled first release would be a great place to start, but this release is certainly worth a spin..."
4,Interesting.,"This album has it's moments. I feel it be a mix of both previous albums. Take the seriousness of 'Pond' and the weirdness of '...Practice..' and you're getting close. Very close. Opener, Spokes is simply wonderful, with the most amazing outro. And songs like Twins and You're not a seed show the thought that the 3 of them are able to effortlesly put into them. Their web page describes how each song was recorded and what exact instruments were used. Even what snare! It's sad they've called it a day."
4,"""The coffee table book.""","A friend of mine lent me this book she called it a ""cofee table book."" I think this a very appropriate title. I found this book not only interesting but inspirational, there are a wide range of artists inside who use a large variety of different types of art using polymer clay. This book would be appropriate for someone who is fascinated by what is possible with polymer clay. Well worth a look."
2,Great for pictures,"It's great to have pictures, but it would be nice to know a little bit about the artist and how they completed their work. A few of the designs say a little bit, but I just feel the book should provide a little bit more information than it does.It's not really worth the money."
4,400 Polymer Clay Designs,Wonderful little book with all types of great clay designs. Great for someone who is learning to work in clay. It is also great for sparking your creativity. I recommend this book.
3,good book poor quality of material,"I really like the book and find it very inspiring. I am very disappointed in the quality of the book itself, many of the pages were torn at the edges and several were not cut apart."
1,man I loved Shudder to Think but...,I love everything they did before this record. I listen to it once a year to see if I'll like it yet. I never do. I hate it when bands forget where they came from entirely.
4,fans can be finicky,"A lush turn with an almost 60s soul flair thrown into the mix, this is quite a metamorphosis after the terse, resolute angularity of Pony Express Record. Decried as sellouts by some, Shudder To Think certainly didn't hit the bigtime if that's what people were accusing them of. But they should have. ""50,000 BC"" is a celebratory record of strong songs and balanced production that hits its mark."
4,Unusual in a good way!,"I am not familiar with other albums by Shudder to Think, having picked this one up for cheap after adoring their songs on the Velvet Goldmine soundtrack. I was initially disappointed to find that they aren't usually glam rock, but the same songwriting ingenuity that attracted me at first is on full display on 50,000 BC. The songs are catchy at times without being predictable. Although die-hard Shudder to Think fans don't seem to like it, this album is a more accessible introduction to the band. My personal favorite is ""The Saddest Day of My Life."""
3,Ford earns record $Billions; Nissan bankrupt; How?,"Americans' love affair w/ trucks/SUVs, cheap gas, and poor Nissan product strategies are what conspired to turn the tables on Mr. Halberstam's predictions. No corporation in the world has been better positioned to profit than Ford since the book came out, though you would never know it from reading it. It just goes to show how perilous the predicting business is. Now if someone could compellingly describe what scenario would bring Ford to its knees know, that would be really a feat!"
3,Completely out of date,"Even though the book is very well researched, it is utterly out of date. It was written when many people though that all the Japanese made in industry was correct and every American manager was a bozo. Well, now it is reckoning time for the Japanese. Today, Ford Motor is a very successful company and Nissan Motors is in deep trouble. If the book had been written about GM and Toyota maybe it might still be interesting, but as it stands, it is only history."
3,A Car Book by a Non-Car Guy,"As always, David Halbestam's reporting does not disappoint. It's true that the world has turned upside down since 1986 --- but that's partly because the hubris is now on the other foot, so to speak. Ford is enjoying record profits, while Nissan suffers through Japan's continuing economic doldrums.That said, the book is often annoying and even more often comical in its display of Halberstam's ignorance of the automobile world. Just three examples --- He uses the term ""sticker price"" in connection with the Mustang. The government had not yet ordained stickers in 1964. He calls a rare old make the G0-Go-Mobile; it's Gogomobile, even in its topless version. He tells us the cost of Kaiser's engine assembly line. Kaiser never built any engines; it bought them from Continental.Still, a remarkable history that reads like a novel. Non-auto buffs won't even notice the gaffes."
4,Kate loves them but....,Everyone should eat them right up. BUT be aware there is zero (0) Vitamin C. You could eat them with OJ but they taste funny.
2,Shoddy Workmanship,At a dept store you can buy a universal cleaning kit without the box for less than $8 and the quality is so much better. The bore mops look like a 5 year old trimmed them. The box is warped. The velvet tray is made of super thin plastic. Over all the shoddy workmanship of this product makes it a huge disappointment.
3,1/2 a degree out.,"I Bought one and its very nice, and well made but its 1/2 a degree out, when you pivot to different degrees."
3,shipping nightmare,"Amazon dropped the ball on this one as well. this item was also in the package of items i never recieved. i was reimbursed for a portion of my purchase although there were 3 items in the box. i was never told why it was ""undeliverable"" which leads me to believe amazon never had access to it to begin with. i was finally able to reorder my dvd's but i was already disappointed with the purchase and the way it was handled."
2,not much information,"i bought this book thinking it would give me more information than what i could find on the internet. however, there wasn't really anything in here that i hadn't already read.also, the salary information in the mechanical engineering section seems very low, at least compared to other things i've read, as well i've engineers i've talked to.if you really want to learn more about engineering as a career (or any job for that matter), visit this website: http://www.bls.gov/search/ooh.asp?ct=OOH. the author even refers to this site in the book. the book itself basically repeats and summarizes stuff from the website, but leaves out a lot of more important material."
3,A Bit Creepy,"A claustrophobic tale of a friendship deeply enmeshed in admiration, power, and the ability to twist things to one's liking. The details are almost excruciating for such a small novel, and the final act of violence is surprising. Fans of slow to boil, compact, vintage (late 50's-early 60's Britain) thrillers should give this one a go."
3,It was disappointing since it only covers Whitman Publishing,"It was disappointing since it only covers the Whitman Publishing company Little Big Books. If you want the prices of other publishers you need an additional book. The number of pages in the LBBs are not listed nor are the artists. There are many pluses to this guide. The photographs of the books are great. They show you what the books look like in top condition. The guide is easy to use, since the listings are alphabetical. In the back is a handy check list to mark off what you have in your collection (a column for the price you paid for your book would have been useful). It is a book I would recommend to add to your references on Little Big Books."
4,Caller ID with Call Waiting Feature,I really like this phone except for one thing. When I'm on the phone and someone calls the Caller ID /Call Waiting feature only works half the time. I called tech support and followed their instructions and it didn't help. I exchanged the phone for another one and still no luck. I really like the phone if only that feature worked because that is the most important feature to me.
2,OK.........,"I I wasn't sure how much I'd like this CD, but it's pretty good. I love the sound, but I'm not huge on Tommy's voice. The collabarations are great, definatly a good album if you like rock."
4,I stand corrected,"Okay, most of us when we think Tommy Lee, think about his bad boy, wild days and probably thought his solo career would spawn another song like ""get naked"". Oh, no my friend, something is wonderfully different this time. I have not stopped listening to this cd.....if you're a skeptic, burn it or something, you have to hear it!"
5,tommy lee is an artist,"i absolutly love love tommyland the ride! it is an amazing cd with lots of wonderful in depth songs on it, tommy has done a fantastic job on his second solo album i bought 3 copys i love it that much. so go buy it"
2,Oh so disappointed...,"Tommy? What the hell man... I mean, seriously, this is a VERY well produced album, just like the last album. But, I was expecting something to come in rock out and it never did. I know that Tommy is getting older and everything and he has always been a diverse person when it comes to music and I respect that. But, this album sounds like a mix of Lifehouse and Nickelback put together. Just look at who else is featured on the album. If you are into any of those people, then yes, this album is for you, but if you are a Tommy Lee fan and a Crue fan, then do yourself a favor and just hold onto everything he has done before. I am not mad that I spent the money on this and will never listen to it again, I support him and everything that he does, but this just isn't my boat. Good luck Tommy, I hope this all goes over very well for you..."
2,What happened???,"My God...Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, what the hell happened??? I thought you were a ROCK AND ROLL drummer, a ROCKSTAR. There is only 1 rocking song on this album and it whines about how hard it is being famous, poor guy. The rest of it...I'm not sure what to say. I guess you are shooting to be a ""pop""star instead... maybe the Avril Lavigne, Sheryl Crow soak up the sun, safe route is the direction you want to go. Bottom line is...if anyone is remembering the Tommy from Motley Crue or even Methods of Mayhem, forget it...he apparently has left the building. That being said, if you are into music that is non-confrontational, it is no worse than alot of the stuff that pop radio is playing these days. You know, the stuff the FCC says is ok....I've been a fan for over 20 years Tommy, I wish you luck with the new direction."
3,Not what id expect.,If you were looking for the techno beats and rock style of his first self titled album dont bother. Tommy really wussed out on this album. What a let down. The guys from the Crue must be laughing there asses off.
4,Well Crafted And A Great Listen!,"Never a fan of Motley Crue, but caught the tune ""Hold Me Down"" years back and really loved it. Prompted me to pick up ""Never A Dull Moment"", which I thought was a great CD. Synchronicity prompted me to pick up his previous CD ""Methods Of Mayhem"", which I also really enjoyed. Having heard Tommy perform ""Good Times"" live on some show, I picked up this album as well. I have to say, it's a really well made and performed album. I still don't know how much Crue I could listen to, probably not much, but Tommy can keep on releasing these albums and I'll keep buying them. His performance chops [guitar, drums, and I think some keyboards] and production skills are great, his vocals gritty, coarse and right on target. Best cuts in my opinion are ""Make Believe"", ""Try To Be Me"", ""Making Me Crazy"" and ""Good Times"", in no particular order. Give it a spin - I think many people will be pleasantly surprised."
5,MUST BUY!!!,Very good loved it from beginig to end! Worth every penny! I could go on and on! And Hellooo Tommy Lee is a Hottie!
5,Great CD,This is a great CD. I love Motley Crue and this just adds to the love even more. Tommy Lee has a great voice! Highly recommend!
5,You MUST Take the RIDE!!!,"This CD is explosive! Tommy Lee has out done himself on this one! I knew the CD would be awesome but when I popped it in my player I was seriously impressed! I love all the songs! ""Good Times"" and ""Watch You Lose"" are my fav's! Tommy keep cranking CD's like this one out and I cannot WAIT to see this CD performed live here in Houston! High five T!! Good work!"
4,Enjoyable Music,"Well I had heard of this album from a friend, I really enjoy the album. I would recommend it to others, in fact I already have."
1,are you kidding me?,"There are alot of bands that have similar styles in music. Hell, alot of bands sound alot alike. But I have never heard a song that ripped off of a band so much than the ""hardest"" track- trying to be me. It has nickelback all f'in over it. Everything from the riff and the way he sings, to the fade in to the chorus and the background vocals. I mean, I've heard similar bands but this is ridiculous. If I was nickelback, i'd sue."
1,albums sucks,"I would give zero if I could, this albums SUCKS Big time, I'm glad I was able to listen to it before buying it, typical music. dumb lyrics."
1,this is a jolk right,Tommy lee is now an artist he's Motley Crue's drummer. With out Motley Crue lee is nothing.
1,pammy needs glasses,beside being the ugliest guy ever seen he also did the worst piece of litter evereleased
5,Way to Go - Tommy Lee!,"Tommyland: The Ride, was well worth the wait for Tommy Lee to release his new solo album. The album is very different than his 2002 release ""Never A Dull Moment"". There are tastes of rock, punk, grunge and pop all mixed into this one cd but it still has to be classified as ""ROCK"" - After all - it is Tommy Lee!!""Good Times"" ""Hello Again"" ""Tryin' To Be Me"" ""Sister Mary"" and ""Tierd"" are already favorites after the first few plays... Definitly worth the money.This CD definitly gives Mr. Lee the opportunity to shine as the star he is - as the front man - opposed to just one of the best drummer out there. Great Job."
5,TOMMYLAND IS A WONDERFUL PLACE TO VISIT!,"This is one ride I'll take over and over! This album is one of those rare finds where every track is good. Tommy has proven that he is way more than just a drummer, he has it all. It's hard to pick a favorite song but I really like Good Times, Sister Mary, and Tired. But trust me every song rocks!"
4,Surprised.,"I was not expecting this type of music when i heard Tommy Lee was coming out with a new cd, but when i heard ANDREW MCMAHON of JACKS MANNEQUIN and SOMETHING CORPORATE would have a song on it, i went out and bought it right away. I NEED YOU is such a great song. If you liked I NEED YOU, you should try the JACKS MANNEQUIN CD in which Tommy Lee returns the favor to ANDREW MCMAHON and drums for a few songs on the album. The rest of Tommyland: the ride is also reall great, but i bought it mainly for ANDREW MCMAHON."
2,Ehhhh....,"I can't say that this is a bad album, but not really that great either. In my opinion Tommy should stick to what he knows best, and that is the drums. But I do give him credit for branching out. There are a couple good songs on this album. Hello Again is a good tune, the acoustic version being the better of the two. Good Times is not a bad song either. But it all falls into the washedout boring style of pop rock bands like Nickleback is known for. A popular style in todays industry; yes, but boring none the less. There are no memorable / catchy riffs or choruses, nothing to tap your foot too. For each time I sat down to give it a listen to, I found myself falling asleep, daydreaming, or turning it off out of boredom.Tommy is a great musician, but he needs to stop hopping along on everybodies bandwagons, and start driving his own. Maybe then he will release something worth listening to. Until then, I'll stick with his fellow Crue member, Nikki Sixx, and is Brides of Destruction."
1,*snore*,I thiink I will keep this book on my kindle to read when I am suffering from insomnia. Too wordy. Too detailed. Too restrained & stiff upper lip British. I would rather do house work than read this book.
3,Travel Envy,This is a gay book about travel and how one hotel's brand of room servic goes above and beyond the call of duty.
5,Simply Wonderful.,"We can never get too many recordings of these Mozart gems using original instruments. This orchestra is among the best. Listening to these performances is as satisfying as a glass of fine wine. The musicians perform with a love and understanding that make these works seem fresh and new, no matter how many times you have heard these works in the past. Don't hesitate to buy this disc; you won't be sorry."
2,Not worth it.,"Paying $40, and reading other reviews, naturally I was expecting a higher-than-average quality and realistic looking corgi. I was super disappointed. This toy is worth $15 at most. Just find a cheaper one, this one will leave you disappointed."
3,Stuffed corgi,"My granddaughter wants a live Corgi, so this will have to do in the mean time. Very nice size for the price. She sleeps with him."
3,Cute but disappointing,"I was hoping to use Chadwick as a replacement for the live Corgi my son requested for Christmas. While my son really likes Chadwick (now called Lewis), and our live Corgi thinks he is interesting, I was disappointed.Don't get me wrong, he is very cute, but he is not as realistic as I hoped or as he was described. There isn't even a hint of a nub at his tail end, and he is very short - even for a Corgi. He cost a good bit more than I think he is worth. Perhaps the Chinese (where he was made) are not very familiar with Corgis."
2,Not for use outdoors,Bought this for our son to use on his sprinkler pipes. He called to check with the company about using it outdoors with insulation covering it. They said that it is not intended for outdoor use. Just so you know that before purchasing.
1,It doesn't work,"I ordered this to keep the pipes on our external water heater from freezing. We live in Dallas, so it normally isn't an issue, but this winter has been extra cold. Got it in three days ago and installed it right away. For the last two days, the pipes have been frozen in the morning. We've had to thaw them out with a space heater. I'll be looking for a full refund."
1,Disappointing,"I have got all of her books but I couldn't read this one. It failed to engage me and I gave it 100 pages. I tried to read it five or six times and finally had to stick it back on the shelf. Her work, like most authors, seems to be unpredictable. A good book will be followed by a mediocre collection of stories. Go figure. I loved the cover."
2,Disappointing,"Utterly disappointing. Reads as though Ms. Gilchrist has become a paycheck writer, turning out product with no interest in quality. Where has the exceptional author of ""The Anna Papers"" gone?"
3,This book lacks drama.,"The beginning was quick to engage my curiosity but I was disappointed. Molly Chamberlain, pregnant and abandoned by her husband of 10 years for another woman, is left with little income to pay rent and living expenses. Molly lacks depth. Rafe Garrick, whose story was never adequately developed, appears and instantly falls for her. He continues to appear out of thin air throughout the book and rescue her. I kept thinking this will be a great story when it gets going - and then it was over. Jessy and Spencer add some diversion but their story is just too simple as well."
4,Slow starter.............,"This book was a slow starter as far as the story line,but when I read more chapters,it did begin to pick up.I thought that Jessy and Spencer were a total mismatch,but happy they finally married.All in all this was a good read.........."
5,Great Love Story!,"Once Around is the first Barbara Bretton novel I have read and it won't be the last! Contrary to other reviewers, I found Molly to be an evolving character, gaining strength and becoming powerful and self-assured. Bretton does a great job on character development, which enables the reader to easily embrace and relate to all of the characters. You are drawn into Molly's tragedy and can feel her pain and heartache. I found Rafe to be a strong and compassionate character and you genuinely cheer for both he and Molly and a life of happiness together.Bretton is another one of those authors expounding upon the power of love in the midst of tragedy.This story was nicely written, tender and compassionate and a story you want to savor for a long time. It is a story of hope and joy and I thoroughly recommend it!"
2,For Really Serious Omega Collectors Only,"With a far from comprehensive collection of color photographs of vintage Omega's, a smattering of vintage ad reproductions, and a barely comprehensible company history, this book's only saving grace is the illustrated history of Omega movements.If you need more movement info than can be found in Cooksey-Shugart, buy this book. Otherwise your money is better spent on something more generic, like (Heinz Hampel's) Automatic Wristwatches from Switzerland."
2,"Beautiful pictures, terrible text","While this book is a worthwhile addition to the enthusiastic watch-collector'slibrary, that worth rests only on the quality of the photographs. The author is awell-known Austrian writer on horological subjects; unfortunately, theawkwardly rendered translation does little credit to either theauthor or the publisher"
2,Omega designs,"A very disjointed and confused book.Very little useful information,the author seems to jump suddenly from one area to another,without fully covering his original subject.Many other books cover Omega designs in a much better way.I would not recommend this book.Also the book was supplied in a slightly damaged condition,it was sold as a new book but did not appear to be new."
3,Yamabushi's mini reviews pt. V,"Ever hear the saying 'less is more'? Well Coyle hasn't. Take 100-150 pages out of this thing and you might have a winner. Unless your a completist for 80/90s techno, skip it."
2,A confusing slow read,"I was disappointed in this book after reading Team Yankee (a five star read). The author writes from several viewpoints-Russian advisor, Russian commander,bad American commander, Libyan commander, different American soldiers. However it just doesn't work. Many of the characters were either not well developed or I just didn't care about them. It seemed like maybe the author was trying to do too much in one book."
2,Not enough battle scenes,"I love Harold Coyles books. My favorite so far being Team Yankee. Bright Star, however, was rather slow in comparison to his other ""Modern Warfare"" books. I felt that there were not enough of those intense, realistic battle scenes that he's known for. The points of view from the different characters would have been more interesting, if there was more action to refer to. At times, I was only able to pick up where I left off of by referring to what stage the love relationship was at!!! Unfortunately, this book was easy to put down, and harder to pick up to resume reading. Don't let this book stop you from reading his other GREAT books, though!! He is otherwise, one of my favorite authors for techno thrillers !"
1,dissapointment,"extreme noise terror have once and for all said goodbye to their punk rock roots....no more political lyrics just crappy death metal....if you like any old e.n.t. (pre-earache)than you will not like this, with only one original member in the band this release is terrible"
4,Holds up over time. Fun and insightful.,I saw this when it came out and liked it . Watched it again recently and was surprised at how fresh it seems and relevant to the issues of today. Warren Beatty shows a new side of his acting ability and Haley Berry is beautiful and talented as always. Lots of fun and worthwhile.
1,Quite a Downer,"It really was not very good- just ok. Wish I had saved the few bucks! By far, Warren Beaty's best was ""Heaven Can Wait""."
3,Rap it away!,"Not a bad movie if you like irony, some rap, and don't ask for perfection. The storyline gets hazy somewhere in the middle, but the rapped communication holds strong. What I liked about this movie is that it tells you what you most likely don't want to hear. It's a comedy, and if you're a Halle Berry fan, it's a must see. If instead you're a Warren Beatty fan, it will put a smile on your face!"
2,"Pick a direction for this movie, please.","A movie that could have been much better. Warren needed to choose if he wanted it to be a comedy, drama, or what. More or less it ends up being a confusing mess, leaving you with mixed feelings about it. The cheezy drama is just that- way too cheezy!"
1,Unwatchably Terrible,"Those who gave positive reviews to this movie are big ignoramuses! This movie may be among the worst movies ever made! The attempted jokes are bafflingly unfunny, the plot is insulting, the acting is terrible, the directing is worse, and most of all, IT'S BORING AS ALL GET-UP! Holy cow is this movie boring! I guess it wouldn't be boring if it didn't think it was so smart. That's what's so obnoxious about it. It really thinks it's a good movie. The people who fell for it are quite gullible. There's nothing more embarrassing than someone who acts smart and isn't--the movie acts smart and it certainly isn't.One of the most dreadful two hours of my life."
1,Horrible,"Simply dreadful. I can usually finish watching most movies even I find them unappealing after I while, in the hopes of finding some redeeming qualities. But I could not finish this utter piece of crap! Beatty rapping is too annoying to be described and the script does little with an idea that could have went somewhere. Yuck!"
2,An Obnoxious Film From an Obnoxious Hollywood Schmuck,"How disappointing it is to see a good idea turned into such bogus garbage. A politician, having put a hit out on himself, figures he has nothing to lose and decides to drop all the phony campaign rhetoric and actually say what he really thinks -- sounds like a pretty good film, right? Not when jackass Warren Beatty is involved. Gets 2 stars only because it is such a good idea for a film and it does have a few funny moments. Otherwise, this is a gigantic turkey of a movie. Just how long can one put up with the spectacle of Beatty rapping? What a sickening display. Not only that, but the film is also drenched in Hollywood's typical socialist prejudices. Beatty whips out the usual leftist claptrap about race, class, and privilege. Nothing is quite so precious as watching super-rich, limousine leftist-types preach to the rest of us about what an unfair society we live in. More proof that Beatty hasn't done anything worthwhile since Bonnie and Clyde."
5,Bulworth is the Best,"Bulworth opens some eyes to what is going on in American politics and big business today. It is also roll on the floor hilarious. I read the reviews posted on the site and those people that think that this movie is about simplistic problem solving missed the whole point of the movie. Everyone knows that there is a problem, Beatty is simply saying that we have wholly screwed ourselves over, and it will be a long time before we get it straightened out again because of the people in power. To me, the movie was more about being yourself, being a spirit, instead of doing all of the stuff that gets you fame and fortune."
4,Too bad it was fiction!,"After he hires a hitman on himself, Bulworth holds nothing back as he attacks EVERYTHING. The movie is funny. I thought the language was excessive and at times the movie seemed to be nothing more than a promotional piece for liberalism/socialism. But it did make you think, which was its intended purpose."
3,"Weird, funny, satirical - but also simplistic","Good old Bullworth, wild and crazy senator, goes from conservative Democrat to liberal Democrat, in Robin-Williams-like style. It's a good satire on politicians (of all types) and American culture, and what is wrong with America - but not always easy for non-Americans, particularly those unfamiliar with black inner-city life, to understand. The surprise ending is not too big a surprise if you follow the movie closely. _Bullworth_, despite the far-out behavior of its main character, is pure mainstream politics. It excludes all but conservatives and liberals, and states that the only antidote for Big Business is Big Government. I guess Hollywood isn't wild and crazy enough to put out pro-libertarian movies like this one could have been."
2,Bulworth is a joke that I didn't get.,"Bulworth's release was delayed in Australia, and no wonder. It's a comedy that's not particularly funny, it's aimed more at American political issues (Australian's have very little interest in their own political issues, let alone other countries), and Warren Beatty's rapping/rhyming senator was indeed embaressing. He doesn't look like a white guy trying to be a black guy, he looks like a white guy trying to be a white guy trying to be a black guy. Halle Berry is an actress that I quite like, but in this she is just an irritating, motormouthed groupie hanging around the aging senator (why would a young, attractive, black woman be interested in a white, 60-something guy anyway). And why does Beatty feel he has to frequently use the foul twelve-letter swear word to get his point across? That alone seems a bit racist."
1,truly awful,"Everything about this movie is bad. The politics are liberal socialist nonsense. Warren Beatty's ""rapping"" is embarassing to watch, and I believe insulting to blacks. Why is it that Beatty believes the only way to communicate and identifying with black people is to rap. Truly insulting. One of the worst movies I have seen."
1,rubish.........,I can not see th dvd since ther are an limited area code to it - so it is a totalt waiste of money.And the does not replay to me either
1,unmittigated garbolio,As a political statement it really sucks. The implication that a politician who suddenly becomes honest turns into a raving socialist requires a strong stomach. The film also qualifies as hate mongering..... implying that insurance company execs are murderous criminals and criminals are merely social activists.If you have libertarian or conservative leanings avoid this pathetic film.
1,"Silly, stupid movie.","I had high expectations for this movie, but was very dissapointed when I saw it. I understand the point Beatty was trying to make, but he should either make it a very dark comedy, or make it a drama. Instead, he tries to do both, and it comes out corny. Every cliche is used here for every character. A lot could have been done with the movie's premise, but instead it comes out as heavy-handed."
5,Conscience of a Politician Finds its way to the Surface,"What a great movie. Jay Bulworth, a US Senator, has himself a nervous breakdown, and hires a hitman to kill him. . . He dissapears for a few days and emerges with a conscience. He becomes dedicated to fighting poverty, with a twist. What a concept. The cast is great. The character interaction beween Warren Beaty and Halie Barry was wonderful. It is definatly dark, but it is hilarious."
5,Hardhitting Comedy,"""Bulworth"" was suprisingly good and entertaining. Beatty gives a first rate performance as Jay Bulworth, a politician who suddenly begins to care for the ignored segments of society who desperately need help. His transformation into a rapping, obsenity spewing, Halle Berry liking guy is actually believable. Excellent soundtrack also, wow! Bulworth makes many apt points about politics, and corporation's influence. I loved this movie, and the ending is truly sad. A must see!"
3,Outlandish but fascinating,"Upon reading that this movie espoused the political beliefs of Warren Beatty, I felt compelled to watch it. I like it when people reveal something so utterly personal about themselves. However I was somewhat disappointed with the movie. The slight turning away from liberal themes, and espousing a socialist turn was indeed something interesing to think about, but I did find the South Central scenes completely unrealistic. No way would he have survived. All in all it was a well written and well acted, if preposterous, piece of film. The highlight of the movie was the semi-crazy homeless man and his message, which seems to cut right through to the essence of what the movie is supposed to be about. I didn't entirely like the movie, but I loved the ending. Very classy. Not a must have, but I'm glad I saw it."
3,A well made film with a good message,"This film explored a issue that we are currently dealing with in our american society: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Unlike other reviewers on this site, who mainly focussed on the languge, and Jay Bulworth's utter insaness, I think through his ""insanity"" he truly found the message he wanted to convey. Warren Beaty should not try another film involving him rapping!! But overall it was an entertaining film"
1,Political crap,"The worst movie ever. Warren Beatty looks clammy and old. Halle Berry is hot, but her acting is worse than Jean-Claude Van Damme's. I didn't understand the plot, if there was one. The worst part of the evening was that my popcorn didn't have enough butter on it, and my Coke was flat, just like the ending."
1,One of the worst movies I've seen in years,"What a terrible (and painful) experience this movie was. No new ground, just fairly inane political, social posturing and commentary that was done better on All In The Family years ago. Old white guy meets hip black girl, starts rapping at inappropriate places, shouts out bland comments about social justice, learns to party with the ""peeps"".Add that to the forced acting and...oh...nevermind...god...give me back my ninety minutes...or erase this from my memory."
1,...AWFUL,"Rates 0 stars (but Amazon can't give a rating less than 1).Patently offensive to blacks, whites, liberals and conservatives alike, foul-mouthed and without a single bit of socially-redeeming value."
1,THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,I saw this movie on video the year it was released and still I remember how AWFUL it was. Warren Beatty and Halle Berry trashed themselves in this movie.YIKES! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!
1,gutter language = gutter movie,I rented this when it was new. Liked it very much except for the language. It's about as bad as it gets. I've heard and used it all but the constant use of the 'MF' word ruined it. Liked it so well I would have bought it if the language wasn't so stupid.
4,I wish they made more movies like this,"Another of last year's forgotten pictures. This was an excellent movie full of great performances and a story with bite. Halle Barry is the only actor in the film that doesn't hit the mark every scene, but she's still very good. It's a sardonic, intelligent trip to take and Beatty should be commended for getting this done through a major studio. The downside, however, is that they didn't know what to do with it. Too bad. It should've been up for a few more Oscars."
4,The Left is Alive - at least on Film!,"The stock market is up to 10,000. Russia is a Capitalist country. We won! So how come Bulworth still makes me feel like I've done something wrong because I'm a capitalist, too? Very good writing, fine performances and an OK plot make this political film both interesting and funny. See if you can take this instead of PoliSci 101 for college credit!"
4,Bulworth - worth the price now even more than then,"So, ever heard of someone who gets in trouble for saying the unpopular thing? What would happen if a politician told part of the truth many people did not want to hear? Outrageous satire of what may or may not be true in politics (you decide), but it's more true in 2008 than in the year this film was made!"
4,Social satire at it's best,"Warren Beatty made one of the best films of 1998 with this dark satire. Beatty not only made a good drama, he made a romantic film, a comedy with hip hop overtones among other things. The cast is excellent in particular Don Cheadle & Halle Berry. If you haven't seen this one check it out and enjoy."
2,Pointless,"Political satire is fine, but this flick did nothing for me. Admittedly, I watch movies for entertainment, not as a gauge of social consciousness, and I had a misperception as to what this movie was about before I saw it. Nevertheless, listening to unending needless profanity and watching Warren Beatty act silly for two hours just didn't hook me. Others, however, may love it."
2,Derivative and antiquated,"Watching this movie I couldn't help but be struck by how the look of the film was stolen outright from Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers""(who in turn stole ""the look"" from Richard Kern). The acting was OK, but Beatty's white-guy-slummin'-with-the-niggas storyline is about 600 years old, and the ending was a tad self righteous (nothing like martyrdom to make you look good). On a related note, Beatty has no ""skills"" rap-wise, and much of the film's humour derives from that fact."
5,telling it like it is,"the reason why this movie shines is the approach that warren took with it. telling it like it is. that's all that was needed. people are sick and tired of all the lies and corruption involved with the politics. warren took that approach and decided to have his character just simply tell it like it is which is how things should be done in the first place. sure the movie is hilarious and all especially when warren did his rapping, but even more than that was the part about telling it like it is which is what warren's main point of the film was. 5/5 stars"
4,This film is actually quite good.,"Well I just finished the film and I must say it's better than I thought it would be. It wasn't as funny as I anticipated, but it's good for another reason. Bulworth is the politician we wish we could have representing us in real life. Warren Beatty puts out a very interesting message through his horrible rapping abilities. The message is of course that all politicians are full of BS. But don't we all wish we had a Senator who would openly admit that? Just watch the movie!"
1,Don't Give up Your Day Job Warren !!!,Warren Beatty attempts to rap his way through this movie that offers simplistic solutions to complex problems facing the USA. Halle Berry is a far better actor than she displays in this movie. Not even a rainy day movie....
1,One of the Worst Movies Ever Made,If you are eager to hear Warren Beatty's pathetically uniformed and self-indulgent social commentary by all means buy this movie.
1,So Bad Its Unbelievable,"As I was watching this movie I kept thinking to myself, ""Warren Beatty made this?"" Man, he's come a long, long way since ""Heaven Can Wait,"" or ""Shampoo."" Not only does Senator Bulworth suffer a nervous breakdown, I wonder about Mr. Beatty. This movie sucked. Warren Beatty looked ridiculous rapping. It wasn't even funny. It was embarrassing. I heard Beatty say in one interview that his friends told him this was the best movie he's ever made. Yeah right. That's what they say to his face. Shouldn't black people be insulted that Bulworth suffers a nervous breakdown and THEN wants to hang around them? This movie is so bad you wonder if Beatty didn't make a lousy movie on purpose. If you collect really bad movies, this is one for your collection."
4,"A small town outside Prague in 1945,","This novel was written in the late 1940's by a respected Czech author when aged 24. The pivotal event in the novel, set in a small town north of Prague, covers the week in the township as the Germans are leaving and the arrival of the Russians. The main character is a young man, Danny Smiricky, who is experiencing all the emotions of love, friendship and adventure during this momentous week in the history of the Czech Republic. The translation is a very readable account centering on the young men as they flex their muscles in excited anticipation of the forthcoming liberation. The novel is very good at describing various flawed characters of the township as they try to reorganise their township without the imposed control of the German occupation."
3,Light Reading,The photos are great. Some of the photos don't seem to depict Celtic art but rather Italian or Indian. The text includes lengthy non-specific descriptions of the spirituality of the Celts which do not communicate much new information.At one point the book suggests that the eastwardly-migrating Atlanteans could have been the source for one influence on the Celts.View Celtic mysteries as light reading and you will not be disappointed.
2,"Decent, but monotonous","Once again, after reading ""Last Exit"" and ""Room,"" I expected great things from Selby, but ""Willow Tree"" is not on par with the others. It has a solid storyline filled with terrible events and tragedy portrayed skillfuly, but after Maria's terrible death, the book seems to drag on about irrelevant things. If you can handle the monotony, than go ahead and give ""Willow Tree"" a try."
5,Men and the Water of Life; Initiation and the Tempering of Men,"You only need to read the introduction to be inspired! A great eye opening, mind altering tool. Well done Michael Meade."
3,Great but for the fake stereo bonus tracks,A great reissue nearly ruined by the fake stereo of the bonus tracks. The original mono mixes would have been so much better. Shame on Tom Vickers who produced the reissue for allowing these unlistenable tracks on the CD.
1,"DO NOT BUY, Item not as advertised!","Looks like I'm not the only person who received the wrong item! This person put a note in the box, part of which said that not to worry this one is cheaper. If I wanted this I'd bought it off Ebay! Don't have time either to return as my daughter is traveling in three days! I'm gonna have to go out and shop for mosquito bands!"
2,Not good reception or Range,"I live in the desert in New Mexico, and I have tried these radios in many different areas, from flat to mild hills terrain and high hills. These radios claim to go up to 20 miles (yes, the title of the item says 18 miles, but the product box it says 20 miles). After the extensive testing this my conclusion; the maximum distance I got in an almost flat area was around 5 miles, not even close to the claimed 20 miles, in a an area where there were some small hills the reception got lost almost immediately as you loose sight of the other person, the same for high hills. For you to get good reception you have to be within sight of the other person, in conclusion for one to get the claimed 20 mile range, the circumstances must be perfect, which in most cases where the radios are going to be used for, are almost impossible."
3,2 way Radios,"On the Midland LXT44D 22 Channel 20 mile GMRS 2 way radio, it works really great, except that we've only been able to talk about 3 miles apart. I think perhaps if you were in the salt flats of Utah, or the flat land of Kansas, that you would probably get closer to the 20 mile talk range. Where we live it is a combination of flat and hills. There is excellent voice clarity."
3,Good Quality - Low Power,"I bought these for use with the AVP-H3 headset to use for our videography service. Communicating on the job in close proximity is clear and interference free. Inside, as in a hotel or other multi-level structure you lose nearly all efficacy. Cannot penetrate between two floors of a hotel.Do not believe any of the distance ratings on GMRS radios. If you need any of these things to work more than a few hundred yards line of site, then buy professional business radios. These are low power consumer models...but very high quality."
1,"Really bad fiction..a compilation of a conman's ""revelations"" from God","Joseph Smith must have thought himself to be quite the prophet. This book is a compilation of this conman's 'revelations' from God.The revelations are all self-serving, ranging from heavenly messages giving the dimensions of a home his followers were to build for him to a revelation telling him to live polygamy.This book details over a hundred revelations given to him from God. What a joke. The book is pretty boring, but there are parts that will make you burst out laughing at the ridiculous, outrageous lies he tells his followers as he shines in his free-form revelations.A must have for every Mormons, I am sure. But for the casual reader, I would suggest you have some strong coffee nearby as this book can put you to sleep quickly.If you are looking for a good book on mormonism, this is not it. I would suggest An Insider's View of Mormon Origins by Grant Palmer."
3,Nice basic children's cookbook,Nice basic introduction for cooking with young children. My grandchildren ( ages 4 and 6) had done so much in the kitchen already that this cookbook did not get as much use as I had anticipated; they were ready for something a bit more advanced.
5,Great fun for parents and children!,"""Pretend Soup"" is thoughtfully written, beautifully illustrated, and a great introduction to cooking for small children. Each recipe has detailed instructions for the grown-up helper, followed by a two-page children's recipe -- step-by-step pictures and simple word instructions.Unlike some other children's cookbooks, the recipes are all ""real"", healthful foods (Pretend Soup is a real recipe for a fruit salad in a yogurt/orange juice ""soup"").This has become one of my standard gifts for the 4-6 year old birthday party circuit."
5,Pretend Soup and Other Real Recipes,"Pretend Soup is an outstanding cookbook for teachers, parents and most of all children! Ann Henderson and Mollie Katzen have written a true gem. Pretend Soup is an absolute CLASSIC! Truly child friendly and yummy recipes. I'd like to see more from this duo of writers: what a great idea to pair up an experienced educator & practitioner and a chef. When can we expect Pretend Soup Two! I am a seasoned educator and director and use this book often in my school.PS I am not 12 as indicated above!"
4,Easy Fun in the Kitchen with Kids,This cookbook is fun for toddlers to read. The pictures are easy to follow and the recipes are good too. Veggetable still are a challenge to get our toddler to eat but cooking/designing the veggi plate is great!
4,My 3 yr old son loves this book!,"My 3 yr old son carries this book around the house and has me read it while he looks at the pictures. He is now begining to ""read"" it all by himself. We have not actually made any of the food yet, but when we do, I know he will be more likely to try the various food. Funny side note... one of the recipes call for you to prick something with a fork, and my son is always asking me to spell things. We were in line at the store when he asked loudly, ""Mommy, how do spell prick"". Needless to say, I wish the author would have used the word poke instead."
2,Disapointed!,"My kids (okay, my husband) purchased me a junior cookbook for Mother's Day last year. My 3-year-old and I have enjoyed several recipes out of that book. I decided to try and find another book that we would enjoy as well. After reading the online reviews for this book, I made the purchase. However, when it arrived, I was disapointed to find a lot of recipes that wouldn't fit my family's tastes. I thought the illustrations for the recipes was a clever idea, but didn't like the idea of flipping back and forth from the drawings to the detailed instructions. I'm returing this book and will again begin my quest to find a cookbook that my kids and I can enjoy together."
3,Good Book,"This book is good, I'm refering to it specially during the weekend to share cooking with my kidd Nasser."
2,"Cute, but could be better","This book is illustrated in a very cute design. I bought it for my twin daughters and was only able to use one recipe. I found it to contain recipes that included items my children (nor my the children of my friends)would ever eat. I thought more insight could have been given to the recipes. If you want a book for adorable pictures, this is it. If you want it for recipes you will really use with your kids...it's not it."
1,Don't bother to order this,"This book came yesterday and I am returning it today. If you want a cookbook to engage kids, this isn't it! Ramen noodles with spinach, just nasty! Let's just pretend to eat.....I'd rather make mud pies with my granddaughter."
4,Pretty good,"This is a great introduction to following directions and cooking methods. Many of these recipes are not quite for preschoolers since some stove top cooking is required, but safety tips and suggestions are included. The drawings are simple enough for my three year old to understand. We are looking forward to experiencing this book together."
5,Bagel face,"Because of this book, ""bagel face"" is the newest endearment in our house. Also because of this book, my three-year-old has cooked and eaten vegetables three times in the last week. Enough said."
4,"Good idea, but format could be improved","My kids and I tried this cookbook from the library. While we really enjoyed making a few of the recipes out of this book (esp. the popovers) I have to agree with another reviewer that the format makes it someone difficult to use-esp. on the spur of the moment. The adult really needs to have time to have thoroughly read the recipe and gathered all the ingredients before the kids join you in the kitchen. Then you can flip to the illustrated instructions for the kids. This is a good idea but not always practical. It would of been nice to have the two meshed so that the kids could ""read"" the illustrations, while you read the directions. I also found the recipes limited in scope and difficulty, but it is great for cooking with preschool age children."
2,Poor Quality. Better Puppets available,This Puppet is not as plush as it appears in the photo. It is actually made from a very thin material which does not hold its form. As a consequence when using the puppet the dog's head is crumpled and distorted and his eyes collapsed back and barely visible. I have tried to bolster the head by stuffing it with paper towels but it doesn't seem to be a good fix. Additionally the puppet does not seem to be sized for adult hands. I have medium sized hands and can barely get my hand comfortably into position to move the mouth. I have collected 6 puppets including this one which I use to play with my son. Of the six this puppet is the only one which doesn't get used. I would definitely recommend the Melissa & Doug line of hand puppets over this one. They are in a totally different class and a much higher quality.
3,Not Quite Authentic,"Yes, this item is sold by Baby Einstein and looks awfully close to the puppet you see in the videos. However, the puppet just isn't as lush and full bodied as the puppet in the videos. The nose is hollow (I'll probably have to stuff is a little to make it fuller) and the materials are a little stiff. It's a useful puppet and yes my daughter loves it but again it just doesn't look the same as the one in the videos."
1,is he wearing lipstick?!,"ok, ummm.... is it just me or does this doll have orange lips in the picture????? uh...ew... ok so n e way, this doll is so ugly! i dont kno y n e one would want 2 buy this! it looks like a girl!!!! unless u r BLIND, do not buy this!!!"
3,"Okay beginning and middle, but good ending","I read Doyle's ""The Lost World"" when in college, and have been waiting for a full-length movie adaptation of it since then. Finally, this adaptation came out, first on cable, and then on DVD. Seeing it twice, I was disappointed both times. First, the movie plot is nowhere near the book's plot. Extra characters have been included that should not have been, probably out of political correctness. Some of the special effects also looked kind of fake; for example some of the dinosaurs moved awkwardly. The only memorable part of the movie was in the end when Bob Hoskin's character lies to his scientific peers after realizing what they would do to his Lost World. I wonder how many natural explorers have done similar things in their careers? Overall, the book is more enjoyable than the movie."
2,Special effects are mixed. Acting is below average. = Worth watching once for curiosity.,"The special effects are mixed. They look good in some scenes. In others, they look obviously fake. For example, the ""ape people"" look exactly like people wearing masks. The acting is the weakest link. It's below average.**** SPOILERS. DO NOT READ this if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the MOVIE.For example, in the last scene, one of the adventurers was stabbed. He sacrified himself by staying behind to cover the withdrawal of his friends. However, his acting was so stiff and unconvincing that it's not touching at all.It's worth watching once for curiosity."
4,Recovery of a distant childhood,"Long before I finished Port Said Revisited I was near to weeping for what the town was--a unique, orderly, warm, and cosmopolitan microcosm--and what it is now.I gave my copy to my dear friend, sixty year old Eid Dib Eid, who grew up in Port Said. He became a joyous, six year old school boy as he recognized places in the photos, many now gone. He said that, when the statue of de Lesseps was blown up, five thousand Egyptians watched and applauded, but he stood, with arms folded, and asked, ""Why? De Lesseps was a great man. He made the Canal.""Thank you, Professor Modelski.Four stars instead of five? Not enough photos!"
4,A very fine book about Port Said,"Sylvia Modelski describes how her family came to settle in Port Said, her school life, her vacations, her family life, the town of Port Said itself, the main ethnic groups and nationalities that lived in Port Said, her contact with Egyptians, and life in the Jewish community. Enhancing the book is a review of events leading to the construction of the Suez Canal and various historical details about developments of the Suez Canal and Port Said. Sylvia also presents briefly some of the contributions that the region close to Port Said has made over the years. These include the path of the major early migrations from Africa, the world's earliest multi-cultural mega cities, the first world-class land/sea battle, major Biblical events and the world's only known major highway in uninterrupted use since the dawn of time. The book is very informative, clearly written and is a pleasure to read."
2,"Love it, but doesn't hold up","I want to start by saying that this harness is really easy to use and seems to be very comfortable for my cat. I was thrilled that I found it. Unfortunately, one of the plastic pieces used to adjust the size is incredibley flimsy. The first harness lasted roughly 10 ""walks"" (not really a walk, since my cat just lazily hangs out on the patio"" and then broke, rendering the harness useless. I was heartbroken, but ordered another.Now, after 3 uses, the same plastic buckle broke again! Disappointing and clearly a design flaw. Unfortunately, I need to find a different harness to use."
5,Good,"Well, it is what it is: a cat harness. Cats don't really like them but mine tolerates it. I put it on him and he only throws his little body on the ground maybe 2 times. He gets used to it after about 5 minutes. Good product. Does what it should. :)"
2,review on alien harvest,I think this book was horrible. especialy how the robot alien could talk[talking robot aliens whats next]. The action in the book was crummy. the best part in my opion is in the parts when they actualy fight.
2,This ALIENS book doesn't live up to the standard of the rest,"Aliens: Alien Harvest has much of what the series' readers have come to enjoy. The dark atmosphere, the forboding feel, the real characters, and of course, Aliens. But this book falls way short of the usually high quality in the Aliens series of books. Much of the book is spent building the two main characters. Character building is very important, but is way overdone and drawn out in this book. The reader gets tired of hearing the same things about the same people, through more than the first entire half of the book. For all this time, there is absolutely no Alien action. None! When the shaky storyline finally gets to where it's going, Aliens fans will not be disapointed, but not overly enthusiastic, either.For series collectors and serious fans, the book is an okay read, but is severely lacking what the other books have all presented superbly. If you're not looking to own the set, borrow this one, or check it out at the library."
2,Extreme Disappointment,"I purchased this book after finishing the initial three Alien books by Stephen Perry. What a disappoinment. There was little action and poor dialogue. Other than the first three in the series, all of the other Alien books have been deriative dribble."
3,NOT REAL GOOD BUT INTERESTING,"I SEE MANY BAD REVIEWS ON THIS BOOK. I THOUGHT IT WAS OK AND I LIKED SOME OF THE WEAPONS AND THE INTERRUPTORS. THE STORY IS VERY SIMPLE, A DYING MAN AND A PROFESSIONAL THIEF JOIN FORCES TO OBTAIN THE ROYAL JELLY FROM THE QUEEN ALIEN. THE MAN HAS HOPE IT WILL LENGTHEN HIS LIFE AND THE THIEF HOPES TO MAKE A RANSOM OF MONEY SELLING THE JELLY AS A DRUG. YOU HAVE THE USUAL CAST OF THUGS AND CREWMEN. THE LACK OF CHARACTER DESCRIPTION AND DEVELOPMENT IS A MAJOR FLAW OF THIS BOOK. YOU ALSO HAVE THE ALIEN ROBOT BUILT BY THE DYING MAN WHO IS A BRILLIANT BUT BROKE SCIENTIST. SO IT'S ON TO ANOTHER PLANET AND A NEST OF ALIENS GUARDING THE XENO ZIP. IF YOU DON'T HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND ENJOY THE ALIEN BOOK THEN YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS MIDDLE OF THE ROAD ENTRY."
2,As bad as Alien 3,"Oh dear! A big dissapointment for fans of Sheckleys prior works, this formulaic, predictable, yet implausable novel about a dying professor building an android Alien to go on an Alien royal jelly treasure hunt treads no new ground and gives the impression that the author wrote it because the rent was due. Fans of the other ""Aliens"" series may possibly enjoy it. Sheckley fans who do not want to see their idol fall from grace steer clear."
2,This book is not by the author you probably think it is.,"I bought this book expecting it to be another fine and funny SF satire by Robert Sheckley. Turns out it was a second rate hack by Robert Scheckley. Needless to say I was disappointed by the flimsy characters, weaker plot, frequent lack of consistancy, and complete lack of humour. If you are a Robert Sheckley fan DO NOT buy this book, if however you are an Aliens fan, you might enjoy the book. It does at least flesh out the Aliens genre a bit, and the cyberalien is sorta cool..."
3,Okay but not Great,"This is another book I got for my husband. He said it was okay, a lot like the movies, but that there were a lot of editing errors. If you're a fan of the films, though, you'll probably enjoy it!"
2,not the best of the series,"This book was a disappointment. The main characters were so unsympathetically drawn, I was quite indifferent to their fate. I was much more concerned about the fate of their pets! The aliens came across more like nipping ants than the fiercest creatures in the universe. I also felt some of the plot elements were unlikely ( the aliens wouldn't be able to smell the difference between a robot Alien and the real thing?) However, if you've read all the other Aliens books, it will satisfactorily fill the void for a while, with several pitched battles and new weapons in the war against the Aliens."
3,Buenos Recuerdos,"Si te acuerdas cuando andabas de ""REPASO EN REPASO"" o ""DE TOQUE EN TOQUE"" como quieras llamarlo (La palabra REPASO se usaba por que casi siempre se bailaba la misma musica; eramos casi siempre los mismos y logico eramos jovenes y no teniamos mucho dinero para invertir en musica asi que todos colaborabamos llevando los mejores discos de 45 RPM y a veces algunos LP) Quien no se recuerda del infaltable exito de KATUNGA ""Mira Para Arriba, Mira Para Abajo""Recomendable tenerlo en loa coleccion."
1,Worst product I ever ordered,"What an awful purchase, Looks like item had been shipped to 4 different households and returned. Picture quality was hideous, Lines through the screen, Colors were faded into the tv on both left and right sides. I returned the product immediately and demanded a full refund. Too bad this thing weighed 140 pounds, I couldn't ship via usps, had to Fed ex and get a refund for that too. What a mess that was, terrible customer service multiple phone calls, couldn't have been more unhappy."
2,"Not very educational, and some scenes go on too long","I was really hoping that this video would teach me more about tantric sex, but i was sorely disappointed. There is a lot of hand action, and many of the scenes go on for far too long with no education. About the only thing this is good for is to watch two men, one jerking the other."
2,"Not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it.","Seemed to be more soft core porno than educational tool. ( no pun )Sure, I wanted to see real people, but they didn't have to all be models-aren't there any average people left in the world? Felt like I got eye candy when I was looking for information and knowledge. For me, it made Tantra seem shallow andsuperficial. Learned more from massage school where they told us what we SHOULDN'T do.I think we all know that the focus here is a sexual one, perhaps an elevated sexual state, but this was presented as a red line hot phone to god. If I want god, I'll go to church.Problem here is that these tapes or DVDs are like getting a pig in a poke. You really need to be able to see them before you buy them. If they were a good product I think they would sell more, even after having seen them.There might be something worth learning in this tape, but it is difficult to determine, and that speaks volumes."
1,Boring!,"Boring doesn't even begin to describe this video. Most of it has been issued on another DVD. I can not remember which DVD. That alone pretty much says it all. This one is not bad as a night light. That is if you want to leave it on repeat play all night. Once you do that, you won't need any sleeping pills to induce a rapid transition into nice deep sleep. That's all folks!"
4,Good Cables,"These were good cables at a good price...Good connectors and insulation, don't expect high-end, but you aren't paying high end either."
1,i did not receive whats in the picture,"i will soon upload pictures of the peace of ***** cables i received , they are not only NOT the ones in the picture but they are worst than just a regular pair of red & white cables , they are thin and very low quality , im very disappointed about that and i cannot send them back since i live in DR cannot believe that i had to stay with cables like those"
3,Good price and good quality,Getting harder and harder to find inexpensive and good quality RCA AV wiring any more. But this one seems a keeper.
1,Very thin and cheap looking cable. Dont buy it from CE COMPASS,"As i said in the title, very bad purchase experience. I am very frustrated!!!! Again, dont buy it from dealer CE COMPASS!!!"
5,RCA cables..... awesome!,I recently purchased the 12 ft rca cables and I honestly couldn't be.more pleased. The connections ARE gold plated and the overall integrity of the cables is awesome. Wish I bought a couple more
4,Rubbery!,"The rubbery feeling is delightful! I don't know how these magic tubes work, but I like them a lot and by a lot I mean a whole lot!!"
1,WARNING!!,"Our Sharp Aquos 32"" television broke after a few days. Two months later, we have no televsion. Sharp has still not fixed, refunded or replaced our television. It is an appalling experience where you wait on the phone for an hour each time you call, get insincere responses and no action is taken to resolve the faulty product. For this reason, I would recommend selecting a manufacturer with respectable customer service."
1,Amazon reneged on price,"I ordered one of these from Amazon on March 18, 2006 for $1,282.49. On March 21, Amazon told me: ""Though we had expected to be able to send this item to you, we've since found that it is not available from any of our sources at this time. We realize this is disappointing news to hear, and we apologize for the inconvenience we have caused you.""I immediately revisited the web site, where it was still listed for sale, but now for $1,399. Amazon simply chose to renege on the price it offered, and lied about it in the email it sent me. I'm sure this isn't legally ""bait and switch"" advertising, but it's very disappointing as a business practice."
1,I would not recomend this product,The picture was great but the sound card is junk. It failed after only 3 months. The local retailer I purchased it fromhas also gone out of business.
2,too small,"I thought this was a bigger sized toy and when I received it, I was shocked. Though it is cute, it did not hold my grandbabies attention long. Maybe as a collectors item it would be okay, but not as a gift to a child. Sorry!"
3,The first discrete improvement.,"Herge, The Cigars of the Pharaoh (Methuen, 1934)The Cigars of the Pharaoh was the beginning of Tintin's adventures leaving, at least for the big picture, the realm of the episodic and getting into big story arcs with returning characters (this is the book that introduces Thomson and Thompson, who would become two of the series' most beloved characters). The adventure itself still has much of the episodic feel one tends to find with things that are serialized, with lots of mini-cliffhangers and miraculous escapes, but this is where Herge really started to find his feet; it's still early work, and reads like early work, but it's good early work. ***"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"This adventure of Tintin's is a fair bit of fun as he arrives in Port Said and runs around with Doctor Sarcophagus as he looks for the tomb of a particular pharaoh.Finding it, there are a few more recent mummies contained therein.Throw in a film crew, some nogoodniks, and a firing squad for Tintin. Snowy is set to be sacrificed to Siva, as well, for some reason."
5,Hours of enjoyment,"My kids LOVE these books! They are great for hours worth of lolling for pre-readers, but they are always captivating for readers."
3,An enjoyable early work.,"Herge begins to get into his stride with this adventure, that traverses Egypt and India. Its genius lies in the illustrations, which trigger the curiosity of children for faraway lands, and the story, which parodies real historical events."
5,a true awakening,"This book made all the things that I've been thinking about my entire life make sense. It was like a lightbulb went off in my head as I was reading, and many times my heart was racing during certain revelations. I think ""The Pleiadian Agenda"" came before this book, but after reading both I feel it is the correct first choice. I recommend getting them both, however.For those without open minds, first read ""The 12th Planet"" by Zecharia Sitchin."
2,My personal opinion,"Well this book seemed very interesting at first so I just had to get my own copy. I began reading the first chapters with much enthusiasm but soon got bored and uninterested actually. I also felt that this book got stuck on less important details at some occasions, but that might be just me.I like the approach of this book but it didn't really convince, me perhaps I had to high expectations or another title would have served this book better...But I'm not alien to ideas of mankind being related to other planets, systems or nonearthly beings etc.I suggest you borrow this book from your local library instead."
5,3 in 1 stroller pram,"My 3 year old daughter loves this stroller ... one because it's pink, but also because it's so versatile; it serves as a pram, stroller and carrying bassinet. And Mom and Dad love the wheels; they just glide over the floors and don't make a lot of noise unlike her previous stroller. The overall stroller isn't heavy either which surprised me and so far it's stood up to her abuse."
2,Rosebud Pram,"Overall it's pretty, but I was disappointed in the way the pram gets attached to the body of the stroller. It is not very easy to attach and it often comes unclipped. This causes frustration for the child and inconvenience for the parents. Also for the price, I was surprised to see a cardboard bottom on the pram."
4,doll carriage,Purchased the doll carrier/stroller for my 20 month granddaughter and she has been playing with it ever since - good size for a small child and quite durable - having the stoller and carrier allows her to put dolls to bed then take them for a walk - very good item
4,carriage,"The stroller is well built, sturdy and easy to use. My four year old loves it. Can hold several dolls."
5,Rosebud Basket,"My granddaughter loves it. She packs it and is ready at the door anytime the family goes out - she has her basket (at least the carrier) and insists that it go, too. I was pleased that it was so well made with a nice ""finished"" look."
2,Stroller fun but quality not so good.,Stroller was so cute and shipping was very fast! My daughter was very excited to get it! Soon after she started playing with it the wheels started coming off!!
5,"adorable ,perfectly functional and sturdy","I took a chance on this stroller because of high review on multiple sights walmart, target. I loved the look and price I saw one similar with a few up grades at pottery barn for 75 but decided on this one with the badger highchair and bed. I love it I know there are some bad reviews about sturdiness it's very sturdy and way sturdier than the graco frame umbrella stroller or some I got from target for 20, this ones way better! I'm not understanding the bad reviews possibly some inconsistency with manufacture ""bad batch"". Our stroller had one black dot but it beautiful for Christmas you can't even tell. Wheels seem a little questionable plastic and rubberish ? Some reviews say basket falls off others dispute that with saying some people might not install it. We installed ours and have no issues. Perfect for lots of dolls life like beautiful. We love the look . Badger basket is awesome. Mama of two girls! Can't wait to see them play with it."
5,"Great quick refresher , with short to-the-point examples","This book does a hell of a good job reminding us of the quick rules and formulas of college algebra. Examples are given for every instance, and in most cases are exactly what the doctor ordered. A great quick reference, can't go wrong here for 6 bucks! Many thanks to the author!!"
2,Needs to be proofread!,"I'm reviewing algebra after not doing math for almost 6 years. I already had a basic understanding of algebra from high school so this book is good in that it's straight to the point. I'm only about 1/4 of the way through and there's already been 3 instances where the examples have completely confused me because there are mistakes in the problems. Don't believe me? Check out page 14, they're switching the signs when finding the remainder but they don't mention it anywhere in the lesson. On page 40 the exponent is a typo so the solution makes no sense! These are just a few of the mistakes I've come across and I'm sure there will be more so if you're buying this book be prepared for confusion."
5,Spot's colorful world,"""Spot's Favorite Colors,"" by Eric Hill, is another fun volume in the series of educational books featuring Spot, a friendly little dog. In this book, Spot introduces the reader to various colors. The simple, cartoon-like illustrations feature a red bicycle, a blue bird, a green leaf, and other concrete items. Spot appears on every two-page spread. Overall, a good choice for the smallest children who are beginning to get interested in books."
3,TINY Book,"I ordered this for my nephew because I've enjoyed Spot board books in the past. It arrived last night and it is TINY. I thought it was going to be a ""normal"" sized book, but each page is about 1.5 in. I'm disapointed in the size, but I'm sure my nephew will still like it."
2,Tiny,"Thought this was a regular sized board book, but it is tiny! The description should have mentioned the size. My daughter does like it though."
4,And now for the tops ...,"The third installment in the Marketplace series again picks up with Chris Parker, the outwardly disciplined and inwardly tortured trainer. This time, he enters the services of a female Mistress in order to help train a would be dominant, Brian. However, the immature and hasty Brian quickly conflicts with the older, more experienced Chris Parker and is forced to learn about mastering himself before being able to truly master others.Like other books in this series, the book is well written and interesting. It provides an interesting glimpse into the techniques of training and is one of the few decent BDSM books written from the tops perspective. (For an interesting alternative, see Susan Matthew's Prisoner of Conscience) Still, the Brian character is so intensely irritating and childish, it is difficult to identify the characters in this book, which I believe is absolutely critical in really enjoying this type of fiction. A great series but I liked the first two books better."
4,Insight into the Marketplace,"The third book in the Marketplace series gives us more insight into how training of slaves occurs by following the education of one would be trainer in the home of the Trainer of Trainers, Anderson. Well written and fairly evenly plotted, we meet again the mysterious trainer Chris Parker though the book does little to answer the questions raised in the first two books of the series. Clearly there is a bias toward the ""Old Guard"" style in the book, the newer approach and what most of use know as the ""scene"" given less than ideal representation. But Antoniou fairly shows us the down side to the Marketplace system as well. If you enjoyed the first two books you should read this one as well."
3,Enjoyed it...,"Though I did enjoy this book, it was a little disappointing when compared to the first two books in the series. I am not sure I would have paid as much for this book as I did if I had known it was going to be this predictable..."
5,Wonderful Book,Anyone appreciating Vanzant's books will equally enjoy THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE. Vanzant has written another winner!
5,Great workbook to your soul,"I started to read this book on Ash Wednesday, one day at a time. 40 Days and 40 Nights later it will be Easter and that is my last day of reading. I have found this book to be amazing. With all the knowledge we have about life and our understanding of it this book for sure puts a whole different perspective on our lives. All good. I will use it for reference for ever."
4,A Missing Link To Healing,"This is one of many books on what is in most wellness programs missing. We all are eager to address the physical body through exercise, nutrition, supplementation, sleep, etc (all of which are of utmost importance) and miss this aspect of wellness.I use all the above aspects of wellness and more, but not until we began addressing the spiritual aspect did we have a complete program. I believe this book gives some very practical ways to help introduce this to others. Not everyone will be receptive but if they are it could be the true missing link to total wellness[...]"
4,The beginning of my journey,"I stumbled across this book several years ago at a particularly difficult time in my life. It helped me make some the difficult decisions that I needed to make to get out of a rut and start moving ahead in life.Iyanla Vanzant's writing is very easy to relate to; I felt a strong connection to her anecdotes because she had also ""been there"" and could turn her experiences into lessons.If your life feels like it's falling apart and you are somewhat spritually inclined, I would definitely recommend giving this book a shot."
3,Ok read,"The book was ok. Passed the time. While I love this woman as an uplifting role model, I just can't seem to get into her books. Not sure why. Give it a try though!"
5,AMAZING!!!,"I am a 21 yr old student, and have just begun that self analysing, spiritual quest. Iyanlas book is nothing short of Divine. It has addressed so many issues with which I had struggled. She has managed to pack every section of this book with wisdoms, which could otherwise take a lifetime to acquire - a valuable gift for a woman of my age.I can't find words enough to thank Iyanla for the sense of peace she has helped to create in my life...a peace I have never before experienced.Yes, this is one of those books, that if you had money, you'd buy one copy for every person you know, and perhaps even those you don't !Thankyou Iyanla !"
1,One star so far,"I can't seem to get through this book. So far I haven't seen anything new, just the usual null content New Age joy-juice. Her writing style is terrible, disorganized and distracting.It strikes me that this is the sort of book for people who wear little guardian angel pins. Easy-fix ""what's in it for me?"" type spirituality. Gee, you might as well watch TV to pick up your spiritual fix!"
2,Wasn't what I thought,I believe I own every book Iyanla has written but this one caught me by surprise. I didn't realize it was more of a 'checklist' and exercise book.I had thought it'd be like her previous books but it was more of a 'work list' to help you grow vs. her writing.
5,OUTSTANDING!,"Really was moving and an inspiration to me. Helped me understand myself and both men and women better. Combined spiritual issues with everyday in a way that was very helpful.Some of what she says reminds me of what I read in another great book. Working on Yourself Doesn't Work, by Ariel and Shya Kane. If you liked Iyanla's Book you would like the Kane's book too. They explain that the title is a Paradox. The more you try to work on yourself, to fix yourself, the more you get stuck. Your spiritual self opens up when you simply live in the NOW and stop trying to change yourself. But there still is a vigilance and self-awareness you need to practice."
5,5 PLUS STARS!!,"I will be the first to admit, I took a lot longer than 40 days to read this book. Mainly because, my soul was so closed, that I had to read certain chapters twice! But this book is so refreshing!! I have totally changed my point of view on life's crisis that once had me bogged down, and my soul closed. Thank you Iyanla! I love you for helping me ""Open up my soul"".DYC~"
3,Honestly? A let-down...,"On TV this woman impresses the living daylights right out of me. I approached this book with interest and high expectations-- maybe that was my problem.Some of the book is highly practical, very useful indeed. The exercises are good for providing focus and make a nice reference for later. But as I worked my way through, I was increasingly distracted by the authors constant presence in the book. I felt as if I were in a counseling session with a mentor who mostly wanted to talk about herself. Again, may have been part of my expectation problem-- had I picked this up as an autobiography, I think I would have been very moved and inspired and impressed. But as it was, I ultimately felt that the book's focus was badly torn between the reader and the author."
5,I have needed this book for 25 years!,"This book has made my list of top 5 books of life to read. It is the book I have searched for for nearly 25 years! While most of the info is not new or revolutionary, I have found some life changing jewels in it. It is like a ""thread"" that links so many of the pearls of wisdom I have collected in my life, and makes many of them usable for me.The book ""leaped"" into my hands at the library off a return cart, and I am ordering Five copies today to replace that one and as Christmas gifts for friends and family.One word of caution, this book may not be for the rigid christian extreme, or those looking to hate anything that does not embrace their world of rightous anger. It will warn what can happen with that anger, as well as give loving alternatives to handle and heal the anger of yourself and others.This book can transform you if you are willing to open to love."
1,sorry I bought it,"I was very disappointed with this book. It was recommended to me by a friend after a tragedy in my life. I was turned off very early on when the author refered to God as He/She. There is only one true God and it is written ""HE"". The fact that the author had to compromise her beliefs to please others and continually refer to God as the divine was truly sad. I tossed this book in the fireplace."
4,In the Meantime,This book by Vanzant has been very helpfulto me regarding relationships. Hopefully it is helping in all my relationships. One mistake that I have made in the past is to let jealousy play a big part and another mistake that I have made often in the past is to focus on the other person instead of focusing on myself.To make myself happy I need to focus on myself and think positive about myself. Ignore that little voice that keeps putting me down. Tell myself I am a good person and I can not expect another person to fill all my needs.
5,One Day My Soul Just Opened Up,This book explores personal growth and is essential for those who are seeking answeres and awareness in thier own lives.
1,Encouraging Ego and that's all,"Ms. Vanzant is good at encouraging us to feel good about ourselves, but doesn't take into account that our lives are not just about ""us"". She discourages learning about history, science, and the arts; which can be the thing that brings many of us to life. Too much focus on what are already the problems of the kids in our society. Lack of interest in the ""whole"" and the interesting things we can discover if we look outside of ourselves and our small focus. Already our kids and young people have been discouraged from going further in their education to learn more about why and how we are the way we are as humans. The more we learn about other subjects, the more we are able to deal with adversity."
3,Nice idea,"The author said it best in her summary at the back of the book: I could have written this in five pages, but the publisher wouldn't have accepted it as a book. This title is a magazine article that was forced into being a book, and I applaud the author and publisher for being so smart as to figure out how to do it. The concept is good, but the writing is not, with sentences such as ""I will to will the will"". I hope the author uses her profits from this pretend book to take a writing class."
3,Who Is God?,"Dear Iyanla Vanszant,I started reading your book and stopped because I was wondering the""Why and Who"" of what I was reading. I feel I need to ask the question of why God is a She?? For all of us who read the bible,nomatter what the translation might be it is the Word of God and it reads ""Our Father.........Christ was His son and so on. Trivial?Perhaps to some who don't know the Word, important to believers? Most definitely!I am curious to know the explanation and I mean nodisrespect. Perhaps I'm missing something and I am open to new things.God bless,Nancy"
2,"This book is the forbidden fruit, ladies!","I know this author is commercially successful & I am politically incorrect but I don't care. Somethings must be said.This book is wonderfully written and sounds very, very good on the surface. All you have to do is be no more than moderately knowledge about the Holy Scriptures and, like me, you can see the real horror of this book.I know this author is very popular with Oprah Winfrey and women are are ""searching"" for meaning in their lives. But don't be fooled! This is just ancient new age philosophy re-marketing thru a contemporary African American female. Nothing more.If readers are so stuck on the publications of this author, then go to the true New Age sources like Rumi or Buddha. The writing is better and the books are less expensive than Ms. Vanzant's.Just see for yourself. Good day."
1,yuck,"i like the chick, i really do. i initially saw her on oprah, all dynamic and inspiring. but, i just couldn't get past the higher power references, which were like every other sentence. i was hoping for more soul work, more generic ""insert-your-own- faith-or-lack-of"" here attitude, and less god-related-to-soul references. if you are religious, you will love this book, and i would highly recommend it. if not, you may like her initial concept but be put off."
5,A beautiful book,Read this book. It will fill you with energy and hope and give you the strength you need to become the best you can at whatever it is that you do. Iyanla is truly a beautiful healer with a wonderful book that is a blessing for all.
5,EVERY BLACK WOMEN NEEDS THIS BOOK !!!,"In 9 days, this book has completely changed my life. Get a copy today!!"
3,Tarnished victory,"Modern Talking usually doesn't follow the road less traveled, but sticks with its safe, money-making style, which you will either love or hate. However, with Victory, they do detour a bit and almost get lost. There are plenty of strong, in-your-face tunes here; some work, like the two Formula 1 hymns (though, why did there have to be two?) and a few dance tracks, but others fall flat through excessiveness or plain lack of memorable melody. The ballads get a passing grade, but are still a step below from the nostalgic ones introduced in ""America."" Lyrically, it's standard Bohlen, with a few attempts at freshness (i.e. Julia). There's just enough here that's good to drown out the bad apples.Highpoints: Reaqdy for the Victory, 10 Seconds to Countdown, Julia, Mrs. Roboto, I'm Going to be Strong, excellent production valuesLowpoints: When the Sky Rained Fire, We are Children of the World, recycled melodies"
2,"Only buy if you're a true FAN,","I would say this is the worst album that MT released in their 12 albums series. I have all of their albums and this one was the worst album. No good melody, there are only 2 good songs in this album. Higher than Heaven & Ready for victory. all rest is boring and not entertaining. I only bought this album cause I'm a MT fan since childhood. I like Thomas's voice in the old albums better. He sounded much better, but he still sings good. Skip this album and buy the last one ""UNIVERSE"" instead. here's my opinion about their albums:The 1st Album: VERY GOODLet's Talk About Love: VERY GOODREADY FOR ROMANCE: BESTIN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE: VERY GOODROMANTIC WARRIORS: GOODIN THE GARDEN OF VENUS: O.K.BACK FOR GOOD: NOT BADALONE: GOODYEAR OF THE DRAGON: O.K.AMERICA: O.K.VICTORY: BAD!!! WORST!!!UNIVERSE: GOOD (I LIKED IT)"
4,Victory 2002,"Not their best, but good.I like just a few songs:02 I'm Gonna Be Strong07 When The Sky Rained Fire12 We Are The Children Of The World13 Mistress RobotaDown On My Knees (B-side of ""Juliet"" - not available on album)The songs on this album are not very well (I mean they are not in MT style, but they are good for a wide public), but the arrangements are so different - so I rate this CD ****"
5,Awesome Soundtrack,"Excellent soundtrack to a fantastic movie. The Method Man track is sick, and there are some other gems on here, including a great Jamie Fox track."
5,This cd is out standing,I really like method man a lot he is so real with his words its like he has been ther and he is trying to let us all know how it is going down. if any one knows how i can meet method man let me know.
1,no thanks.......,"I am a Bittner fan and have enjoyed many of her books. This one isn't one of them. By the time I got to page 80, rape had been discussed at least 20 times. It starts with Nina's mother's brutal rape mentioned several times, Nina's fear of men, all of the leering and lusting of the men she encounters, then the actual attempted rape by a sleezeball, only to get out of that and have her threatened several times with gang rape........I just didn't see a great future in continuing the story..I am not affronted by the topic of rape withing a good story's context but this was mentioned every few pages in one form or other or at least that is how it seemed to me. Anyhow, I tossed it.It's your call."
1,Misleading Photo & Title,"Probably my fault but I was mislead by the photo of multiple pieces of wood and the use of the plural description of ""1' by 1' squares."" Only one piece of plywood was sent which, when compared to a sheet of plywood makes this prohibitively expensive. Very disappointed."
3,meh,The story was okay and nothing the other stuff of Gena's I've read. I know this series has a huge following but I'm good with skipping it. It just didn't grab me enough.
2,Poorly written!,"I have tried 2 of Showalter's titles, and couldn't finish either of them. I'm going to have to give up on her I guess. She's not a great writer, and her editor doesn't bring her material up to standard.The characters are poorly developed, and the relationships aren't believable. This woman's friends and co-workers support her totally, but we never see any real reasons for that type of devotion. The alien hero (Kyrin) is completely and intensely passionate and committed to a permanent relationship with the Huntress, but those feelings come out of nowhere so fast and intense it's really unbelievable (well, more than any alien story is unbelievable, that is!)"
3,It was a page turner,"In, Awaken Me Darkly, we meet Mia Snow, an A.I.R agent that kicks butt! And I mean that literally. Her character was portrayed as overly aggressive for my tastes. Overall, the book was good because of the cop-mystery going on, but it lacked the ""connection"" between her and her lover. I may be a bit biased as to how the book was written since this wasn't the first book in the series I actually read. I bought, Deep Kiss of Winter because of the other author, Kresley Cole. Months later, I decided to read the second story, Gena Showalters. I gotta say, I loved it! So, I bought the first book, and...... not what I expected."
4,Book 1,"Really liked this book. Loved Kyrin, the story, the plot. well written. Mia is my girl! I kinda teared up towards the end."
1,is brutality equality?....,"LJ Lewis' review below pretty much sums up how I feel about this book as well.I found this book a rehash of the whole ""tough cookie"" heroine and not in a good way. The behavior of the heroine, Mia, is brutal and off putting.The storyline is that the Alien Hunters have complete authority over all Alien species, judge, jury and executioner. In just the first 100 pages alone you see the heroine committing various forms of police harassment and brutality, all the while thinking to herself how much she dislikes most Aliens. And she's supposed to fall in love with an Alien? Is this supposed to be enjoyable?If this was a male lead I would consider him a villain-and I consider Mia Snow one equally. At one point she tells a suspect ""you know I have no conscience"" and I agree.When did equality mean to be equally brutal?0 stars."
4,A Romping Good Read,"If you like a good paranormal with a kick-butt heroine, then this is as good a place to go as any, especially considering the mess the LKH books are right now. The main character, Mia, is smart, determined, and an excellent alien exterminator bent on ridding Earth of off-worlders. The mystery plotline is okay, a little predictable, but not bad, and the romantic lead is well done, if a bit cookie-cutter. But all-in-all, a great amount of fun."
1,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed, this book reminds me of JD Robbs ""In Death"" series, the girls hard, the guy fights with her til he gets her, I picked up this one and I shouldn't have but I thought that I would give the author another try after I read Pleasure Slave that reminded me of Sherrilyn Kenyon's book Fantasy Lover. I don't think I will try this author again."
3,"Derivative, but fun","The penchant for paranormal romance is giving a lot of stories out there a chance they wouldn't have had 10 years ago. Awaken me Darkly is one of those - an alien romp with a strong, AnitaBlakeEveDallas lead and a tall dark handsome mysterious hero.As another review has stated, this lead is very much taken from the pages of Robb and Hamilton. That's not necessarily a bad thing, if you like those strong, no excuses females. There's also a supporting cast of characters - these women have lived good lives and made good friends and co-workers as well as bad enemies.The writing of this book,however, was somewhat stilted. It almost felt like a first novel to me.There's a plot twist that one comes to expect with these kind of books. There's a lot of beat-em-up fights and beat-em-up sex. Which one also comes to exect with these kind of books.It was fun. I won't be buying the sequels.(*)>"
5,not Anita Blake...THANK GOODNESS!,"I see a lot of readers comparing this to Anita Blake, some people happy about it, some disappointed. I say it's not at all, and thank goodness for that. This is Mia Snow. She's a character all on her own. I love her toughness and her tenderness, and that she can kick butt and look good doing it. I for one can't wait for the sequel, Enslave Me Sweetly. And if I had to chose between an LKH book and a Gena Showalter book, I'd go Gena all the way!!!!"
4,AN INTERESTING BOOK,"I liked this book, the story kept be reading page after page. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read."
2,Just my opinion,"I expected it to be better. For some reason it left me feeling flat. It had some good parts. I liked the fact that the ""heroine"" was tough and smart."
2,A Disappointment,"I was looking forward to trying a new author, especially one who has already written several books. Unfortunately, I doubt that I will waste time on another one by Showalter. The plot and characters were one-dimensional. I liked the original premise, but it was not well executed. The whole book felt very surface. I wound up not really caring for the characters. Mia needed some very intensive therapy."
2,Too much of a good thing,"Maybe I am still suffering from burnout from another author, but the whole female beating everyone down and barely working up a sweat doing it got old after the first couple of chapters. I like female main characters with some grit and espeicially when they can hold their own in a fight, but this was boring.The ideas she has for the various aliens were really interesting and the setting of the story was also believable, but the main character was a joke. Everyone gets their butt kicked now and then because if you are too good at everything then you are not realistic enough to be believable.The author shows potential, but if she wants to write more than romance she needs to keep the characters a little more believable and a little less cheesy."
4,SciFi Goodness Wrapped Up in a Sexy UF Package,"I was so excited when I found this book. It's a SciFi Urban Fantasy! Would that be urban SciFi then? I'm not sure. Awaken Me Darkly has what readers have come to expect from the UF genre, lots of action and a kick ass hero, in this case Alien Hunter Mia Snow. The author does a nice job setting up the twist, which is something that some of the faster paced stories have trouble with. The science fiction aspects, high technology and aliens, were well fleshed out and really added to the story. I would have enjoyed a little more science I think, especially in regards to a major plot point, but I admit not everyone reading the genre would want that.If I have a complaint, it's that the ending seemed rushed and didn't live up to the great pace and tension that the the rest of the book had. Well worth reading if you enjoy your UF on the adventurous side."
3,Great new Alien populated world with sexy heroine Mia Snow,"Great start to the series. Reminds me of the earlier Anita Blake novels, a strong independent aggressive female (Mia Snow) in law enforcement of supernatural creatures except in this series there are aliens. Aliens that are intelligent, sexy, evil, good and have unknown powers that humans have to police in this futuristic new world by Gena Showalter.Mia Snow firmly knew that aliens were bad and her jobs was to be eliminate all that broke the law. However, her firm beliefs are shattered as a case of missing human males start turning up dead and the aliens she suspects are involved have the power of saving her friend and of turning up her sexual desire.If you would like to read the whole review please visit [..]"
2,idiotic extremely violent irritating heroine,"I bought this book with good expectations based on the reviews and the fact that I love a good paranormal romance. I was disappointed. The Mia Snow character is really irritating. She's extremely violent, bad-tempered, undisciplined and would be a disgrace to any law enforcement agency (even a futuristic one). Her alien love interest is a classy guy and it's beyond me what he sees in her, since she tries to beat him to a pulp repeatedly. The romance isn't convincing at all. I also thought the primary storyline (alien babies) was hard to follow."
3,Better than average but a little disapointing,"Mia is an executionar a la Anitta Blake but she kills bad aliens. Not a lot is known about the aliens and thei versious powers. She keeps trying to beat up on a classey alien Kyrin who has a serious case for her bod. Unfortunately her personality is rather unpleasesnt as well as violent so I don't see why. There is some humor, a good plot twist6 and a little humor although the book is not errotic."
2,Not Anita Blake,"Sorry, for those who compare this author to Laurel, you are barking up the wrong tree. I was disappointed when I sat down and started reading this novel. Not only was it highly confusing, but simply boring.The Anita Blake look alikes must go!!!"
1,NOT Close to Laurel Hamilton,I admit that I bought this book thinking it might be similar to books I've enjoyed by Laurel Hamilton or Charlaine Harris. It was not. I found it to be trite and formulaic. I just couldn't buy into it and felt that the heroine was one dimensional. The book is already in my bag for Goodwill. I didn't like it enough to even try to give it away to a friend.
1,Total waste of time,"I to feel like this book was not written very well. Some of the things that happened in could have been explained better and the romantic aspect of it was not there. The story seemed more writing formula than plot. I have never felt more frustrated reading a book, as a matter-of-fact I put it down and started reading another book, before finishing it.I won't be reading any more of her books.On the other hand I have fallen in love with author Susan Elizabeth Phillips work. Here is a romance writer extraordinaire. Her books have great descriptive plots, her characters are well developed and she makes you laugh out loud or cry. She is a true erotic romance writer for the ages!"
1,"Great Series, DVDs in set were defective. Returned One Set So Far",The companies producing these large DVD sets are doing so with such poor quality that I have stopped buying them. I had to return one set of Six Feet Under already when the 5th DVD would not play. Was almost going to buy The Wire Complete Series DVDs until I read all of the negative reviews about defective DVDs. Don't want to spend lots of money only to find that DVD 16 and/or 20 won't play. By that time return will be impossible.
5,Top of the pile,"Wow.What a series.It tackles all types of uncannily real situations and people.This is a real human show and left me feeling the entire gamma of feelings:crying,laughing,anger,etc.I love the family represented in six feet under and find myself talking about them and their situations with my girlfriend as if they were real people.This show reflects life so well.If you haven't watched this yet you are in for a treat.I found that we had to ration ourselves to 2 episodes a night so it would last.I love the Fishers and Keith...and Brenda...This best series of them all and I'm an owner and big fan of Deadwood,24,The Sopranos,Curb your Enthusiasm."
4,SFU review,"Finally, the complete six season set. I wasn't the biggest fan of the show, but it nevertheless, was a good show that I watched weekly. The show did have some very dark sides to it, but that may be of great appeal to some. It also got a bit ""cooky"". Not that the show got weaker as it progressed, but season one was probably the strongest season. For under $100, I would recommend this dvd set. Enjoy!!!!"
5,Six Feet Under,"With the end of the series it's great to see a complete box set of this superb show. Each season gave us highs and lows, as well as dark humour and touching, poignant relationships. The way it covers the various issues of death is refreshing and you really became involved following the lives and trials of the main characters. The seasons had many story lines, from the illness on one family member, to the development of another's art career, to the various boyfriends of Ruth (the mum in the series) and way more besides. What better way to celebrate one of the most original series to come out of America in years than to buy, watch and enjoy this outstanding boxset?Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,One of the best HBO series ever,"I first watched Six Feet Under at my parents home as I do not have HBO at my own house. After seeing a few episodes, I got hooked. I have since purchased every season on dvd. The series was absolutely incredible. The series revolved around a family who owned and operated a funeral home. The stories were about their interpersonal relationships with each other, their outside romantic relationships and their dealings with their ""customers"" on the outside perimeters or each episode. It was one of the best original television series ever shown on HBO. Definitely worth seeing."
5,Don't let title turn you away!,I never thought I would enjoy this show as much as I have especially when I heard the title I wasn't too interested but a friend who thought I might enjoy it kept telling me about it and let me borrow his copy of the series to watch. After I saw the 1st episode I was hooked and then understood everything he was telling me about the show! It truly is a show worth watching and having your own copy of!
5,"Funny, moving, and above all engrossing!","I just love this series. I had never seen it when it aired on HBO, but always thought it was strange to have a series based around a funeral home. It is so much more than that! The characters are all so vividly portrayed and multi-dimensional; you can't help but want to keep watching to find out what happens to them next. It covers so many issues, from death to homosexuality to bipolar disorder to drug abuse to infidelity to teen angst, and so much more. It is funny, moving, and above all engrossing! The strong language and some of the subject matter may not be appealing to everyone."
4,A wonderful show,"I just spent the last 8 weeks watching this with my partner. We fell in love with the show and enjoyed the series immensely. The characters are wonderful and the acting is top notch. It was hard to let them go as the series came to an end.I would say the first 2 seasons are the best and the last 5 or so episodes of the last season too.I think the show loses it's way for a while and stops blending humor and drama and goes a bit overly soapy/angsty for a while but eventually gets back on track.If you are looking for a series Drama about life and death and the ups and downs of Marriage ,mortality and surviving life, than this is the show for you. It was also refreshing to see a realistic dipiction of not only Straight couples and the problems they must tackle together on an every day basis but also a gay couple which I have not seen realisticly portrayed on TV without the stereotyping.Hats off to Alan Ball and the Actors and writers of this show. It's now one of my all time favorites."
4,"Great packaging, but a little tight.","Obviously, this is a great show. I didn't buy the DVDs until now because of HBO's insane pricing, so I was happy when this came out (and in such a neat box, too). The only problem I have with it is that the individual seasons and ""In Memoriam"" booklet are wedged inside very tightly. It's really difficult to pull a season out, so I've had to take the ""In Memoriam"" booklet out of the box for more ease. Not a huge problem, but one that grows increasingly annoying. Still, definitely a great box set."
5,Six Feet Under Series,"I received my shipment earlier than expected and the price was incredible.The packaging of the series is awesome. If you liked the show, you need to pick this one up!!!!"
5,Six Feet Under Complete Series,"Very happy with the seller who provided this product. It was delivered within two days. Write-up stated that product was new with some package damage. Product was delivered as stated, only damage was torn cellophane and some minor fraying on one corner of the box. Would highly recommend this seller."
3,Overrated,"The characters are caricatures of themselves, and the overall tone is overly emotive and manipulative. All art is manipulative but here the manipulations are simplistic. I have nearly finished the second season but don't think I will carry on. I am weary of these whiny, myopic characters and the mediocre writers behind them. I did give three stars because I think the show's premise is fantastic, and the casting too. Nothing wrong with the acting. It's the writing. There's just too much good TV on DVD out there to waste your time on anything ""meh"". Ciao, Fishers."
4,"All they said it was ""cracked up to be""",This series has been enjoyable to watch. The production on this series is top notch and the cast seems to mesh really well. The imagery is pretty from this show and the story line is consistent. The show starts the same way each episode with a death. If you like Michael C Hall or Peter Krause most likely you will enjoy this series a lot.
5,Not such a good buy...,"A super series that sets the bar extremely high for a television series. However, you can purchase this series for one hundred six dollars on buy dot com -- a huge savings over this site's. Why has amazon raised the price so high in just the last couple of months?"
5,Maybe the best show ever made,This show was so thoughtful in it's potrayal of it's characters & those who move in & out of their lives. You can't help but become involved with the characters. I hated to see the show end but the series finale was the best I've seen. Highly recommend this show.
3,Six Feet Under - Viewing Challenges,"I love this series- brilliant writing and production. I was keen to see it all again but with some of the DVD copies, I have been having trouble viewing them as they have been pixilating or skipping. I have an excellent DVD player so I think it is the product."
4,Great Show but technical difficulties,"I absolutely love Six Feet Under and would highly recommend watching it, unless you're squeamish or a homophobe. Bought the collection as Amazon's ""Deal of the Day."" Half the discs in the last season don't work- buyer beware!"
