3,"Lame, stupid and untrue","Barely better than stock, NOT like advetised, I have HIDs and have gone through other bulbs that claim to be equal, but nothing is like the real thing. Its just crap, recommend against."
1,Terrible In an Acura RSX,"I would definitely not recommend these for an Acura RSX. The two I installed blew out in no time. The first didn't even last a month(!), the second lasted less than three months. The extra brightness is not nearly enough to compensate for the lack on longevity of this product, not to mention the extra expense, and the time wasted installing these. To be honest, even the standard bulbs don't seem to last that long on an RSX, but they definitely last way longer than Silverstars."
1,POS,"I have bought three sets of Silverstars, with the most recent being the Ultra version, since it was supposed to last longer. All have lasted less than a year. IMO, the slightly whiter beam does not compensate for the short life. Any additional safety garnered by a slightly brighter light is more than offset by having to drive with only one bulb until you notice that one is dead and can get around to replacing it. Never again."
5,Brights,These bulbs are great. Ive gone through 3 sets so far in the past two years. I like the amount of light they emit and how white they are. The only downside is they are expensive and do not last long.I think they are worth it.
1,Short Life,"These lights don't last. I don't know how often some of you use your lights, but I use them for at least 40 minutes everyday. In less than 6 months, one of the bulb burnt out. This is the second time it happened to me.The first time was the original Silverstar and I was hopping the new version will last longer. I guess the Silverstars are made for looks, not longevity.Stay away from them unless you want to change your bulbs every six months."
1,used these in 2 honda cars. All 4 bulbs burned out in about a year,"Installed these headlights in Honda Accord and Honda Civic at about the same time. Just over a year later all 4 have burned out. The original equipment bulbs in the Civic lasted 8 years. Brighter light is nice when new, but you lose the advantage when you have to drive 100 miles with just the passenger light during a snow storm. Went back to the cheap lights with the long life. Just changed out the last one outside in 20 degree temps."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased a pack of 2 silver star headlight bulbs. About 8 months later, the low beam stopped working on one. I bought a replacement. 2 months later the other failed, same problem."
4,Great Inexpensive Headlight bulbs,The headlights were easy to install on my 3 series BMW. They provide a clean bright white color and I can confidently say that nighttime driving is now safer.
3,Dim,"After installing these headlights, I realized they are very dim. I'm not sure if its the bluish color that makes them dim, or the angle of the light. They are not as bright as the original headlights that were in my car. I was surprised because they were so expensive."
2,"brighter lite, but at what cost???","replaced the stock sylvania lites(approx 06/2006) in my 06 civic shortly after I bought it with silverstar ULTRA 9006 su. paid $50, and one burned out last night. I don't drive that much. I only have 12k on the civic. I consider less than 2 years of bulb life unacceptable. plus I have to remove the battery on the driver's side to change the bulb. I even use the latex medical gloves so I don't touch the bulb while installing. I put a set of these in my wife's 03 Rav last fall, and am anxious to see how long they last. not buying these again."
4,Brite Car Lights,"Nice white light, not as bright as promised, but brighter than stock. Life is a little short. A good replacement if the price is right."
2,"Silverstar Ultra 9006- Great bulbs, but SHORT life","Brightest bulb out of 3 I've tried, but I had both go out on me within a week after 8 months. I called Sylvania and they said the bulb life is only rated at 200 hours. They are sending me replacements, but when these go out I'm going to definitely try something different. There are a lot of deer in my area and I need as much light as possible, but there has got to be a better alternative to replacing bulbs in less than one year. I'll go back to these if I have to, because it's not worth getting my car (or myself) torn up due to a deer crossing the road."
2,Short life - especially considering I don't drive much at night!,"I bought these for my Suburban primarily for towing our camper at night. The increased visibility was nice however they gave no improvement in rain, and after a year one has burned out already! Now a year may seem reasonable until you consider this vehicle is rarely driven at night. It's May now and the last time we had it out at night was to see Christmas lights.So I will try Philips or GE now, no more Sylvania."
3,"Meh...Review in one word: ""overrated""","Even after reading the reviews I ordered them anyway. Everybody seemed to complain about their short life--me, I'm underwhelmed with their dazzling brilliance--they're nice and White and _M_A_Y_B_E_ 15% brighter than stock bulbs in my Avalon. If I had to buy bulbs over again I would NOT get these regardless of how long they last. Review in one word: ""overrated""."
2,Doesn't fit 2002 Chevy Tahoe,I double check the references on here and it does not fit a 2002 Chevy Tahoe as it claims to. the socket is similar but the plugs are not. Package has been returned.
5,Good so far,"Like others, I bought these because of the price. I do notice an improvement in night driving. If they last a year I'll be happy. I had PIAA's that lasted 8 months. When these go I am going back to my stock headlights."
2,Not what I thought it was going to be,The color of the bulbs was not what I thought it would be. The comparison pictures did not match at all. The product shipped on time and was in working order though.
5,The Height of Napoleonic Adventure Fiction,"You may start with War and Peace, and move to the nautical fiction of Kent, Forester, and O'Brian, and finally to the Sharpe Novels by Cornwell. But the best of the adventure novels set in the Napoleonic era are the Roger Brook series of books by Wheatley. Major historical figures pop in and out of this series as the hero travels around the world giving a good historical overview from just prior to the French Revolution to Waterloo."
5,This is a great set at a great price,"Except... it is listed (twice) as SLIK, but it is a set of Sunpak filters. That doesn't really matter, though, since the quality of these filters is better than I expected. I was impressed with how much nicer these filters were than some Tiffen filters I bought for my larger camera.For the price, this is a GREAT set."
3,Good lens protector,I use these filters to keep dirt and fingers away from the lens on my Canon HF20 video camera. The UV filter doesn't really do anything for me but the polarized filter can make a positive difference in outdoor filming.
4,.........,"i've really been wanting to get a mp3 player for the longest time because i was tired of searching for w/e cd i wanted to use. so i got this creative zen 20 gb..i mean wow 20 gb. i thought that was awesome! the buttons work fine and if u make the pad medium sensetive then it's fine. uploading music to it is pretty easy but it helps if you have winamp to rename stuff and what not. the only problem i had was the first time i used it, the given headphones that were there...only the left ear worked so i bought a diff pair of headphones, otherwise that's it. it's a little heavy but it holds alot so it evens out. oh and the pictures ...some pictures don't look great on it because it's really blurry and small screen but it's still pretty cool that it holds pics too. i haven't used the recorder yet, but the radio works fine as well."
2,hardware problem after 1 week,"After 1 week and trying everything - we called Creative and they said it was a hardware problem. Amazon has been good about refund - but we wanted a replacement. Sister has the 30 gb and no problems with that. Will try to purchase another 20GB in a few months hoping the ""bad batch"" is gone! These children worked for 1/2 a year to save money to purchase these items - at least the company obviously stands behind troubled ones. Neither the 30gb or 20gb worked well with windows XP on our main computer but they seem to do ok on mom's laptop - go figure!"
5,This is a great mp3 player for the features and price!,"I bought this mp3 player for my teenage son for Christmas and he loves it. Great capacity (20GB), easy-to-use buttons, easy to load and manage songs with Windows Media Player 11. It's very sturdy but we did purchase a separate skin to keep it safe. The charging cord is great because it can be plugged into a computer via USB or converted to plug into an AC outlet. The only thing that could be better about the cord is if the end that plugs into the mp3 player was a standard camera-style end rather than the proprietary Creative end. Great battery life. Great sound."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"I bought this player to replace the Zen Touch that quit working after two years. I received it less than a week ago, loaded 1500 songs on it, and it quit working today. The Creative phone assistance told me to send it back and it would tak 10-15 days to get it either repaired or replaced. I will now start researching another mp3 player to load my music onto again!"
4,Good Player,"I bought this mp3 player because i'm headed to college and needed one. I was looking for high capacity, easy to use, and under $200. I've had the zen sleek photo for about a month now and so far so good. It was easy to use from the start. The touch pad took a little longer to get used to but its fine. I have it all set up so as soon as i dock it, all new songs sync to it automatically which makes it even easier. The battery life is also very good. I've never had an ipod so i can't really compare to that. But it has done everything i need it to. The only cons are that you can't see the display in sunlight, and the a/c charger is connected to the usb cord, its kind of a hastle but you can buy a separate a/c cord to charge it for about 10 bucks. Also i noticed some dust getting under the screen, maybe a skin or screen protector will keep this from getting worse. Overall i am happy with my purchase, as long as it doesnt die or something on me, knock on wood."
4,Good Price,"This item is a good deal, but I was hoping with 20gb it could play some kindof video. If anyone knows how to encode videos on it, please let me know!Great battery life too."
3,Needs some improvements,"I have had the Zen Sleek photo 20 Gb for about 3 months.What I like about it:+ large storage+ excellent sound+ compact+ great priceWhat I dislike about it:+ awkward method to recharge battery (the charger connects through the USB connector cable; ???)+ lacks a key to execute commands; a simple OK key would have done it.+ the user interface is not intuitive. For example, navigation using the keys is counterintuitive and the usage of the sliding key takes time to get used to it (I have yet to master it!)Overall, nice player but, if I have to do it again, I would probably not buy it."
5,Great,This product is great. It's not an Ipod but it just as good and cheaper. I take it everywhere . I also bought mini speakers and only play this item anywhere in my home.
1,Shocking Customer Service - Cheap parts,I got a new player. The power connector (at the base of the player) got stuck with the player because of over heating (I had connected it for exactly about half an hour to charge it). I could not detach the cable from the player. When I finally did - the whole circuitry ripped off from the player and I could not power it anymore. I had the 90-day warranty that comes with the player. When contacted the customer service - they were rude to the core and said I had inflicted physical damage and they are going to charge me - $ 130 ( I bought it for $160) to repair it.I vow I will never ever buy anything from Creative because of the cheap parts and the rude customer service with lying warranties.
4,Zen Sleek Photo,"Seting up this device took a second try but since then it has worked well and adding songs, outlook and pictures are easy. The battery life isnt what it claims to be and lasts only 8 to 10 hours. Priced lower than an I-Pod, it was worth it."
5,Great,"Great Product. I owned the zen before this one and it was great though the screeen is a bit smaller, the colors are great and the picture capabilities are a nice plus. For a basic MP3 player this is just right and for the price it's definaly good especially since I paid a lot more for its predecesor."
3,Great for about 1-2 years,"I loved this MP3 player. The software for getting music on it is super fast and easy. It holds a ton of music and is in general a great MP3 player. I started out with a Creative Zen 8gb Microphoto and was having problems with it within a month. I returned it and upgraded to this one. About a year and a half later it crapped out and is no longer usable. I took very good care of it. I have a few friends that also have Creative Zens and theirs have started having weird problems as well.So short term its great, especially for the price but keep in mind they don't seem to be built to last."
3,Decent MP3 Player,"It's kinda buggy, especially when writing to it. It's prone to freezing up, requiring you to restart it. And for the price, it's quite the small hard drive. And the menus are hard to navigate, especially with the slider. If you're looking for a good MP3 player and you have a small library, this is good for you."
1,Dissapointed,This looked like a good product but it did not work properly when we received it and I believe it does not interface with Mac computers. We returned it after a day of trying to make it work and paid the extra money for an iPod.
1,Died After 3 Days,"I loaded 16 gigs of my music and listened for 3 days before it completely died. It gave me an error message, and then went to a black screen. It will not charge. It will not play. But it looks cool on my desk. I took it back and won't get another."
2,Windows interface is mind-blowingly terrible,"This was a gift from my parents, because they decided they wanted iPods instead. They made a wise move. The day-to-day usage of this mp3 player is fine, it's easy to find songs, and pretty easy to play them. However, sorting the music you put on it is impssible. The help menu does not help; it tells me to do exactly what I've been trying to do for the last hour, and I still can't do it. Avoid this and get an iPod-they're ubiquitous for a reason."
1,compatible only with xp,"what kind of product is limited in compatibility to one OS? for those who try to avoid xp, this is a problem."
3,A painting instruction book emphasizing content.,An older book - copyright 1969. There is a lot of reading and all but a few of the illustrations are in black and white. I prefer the newer style books with better layout of pages and color.
2,Memory and Rant,The book was part memory from the past and part complaint. The political comentary about the Church in general was written from the post vatican II liberalist perspective. One has to remember or at least know what kind of experimentation was happening in convents and abbeys in the 60s and 70s to understand the author's perspective. I had the feeling that if the author's health had not deteriorated she would have left the convent. I didn't find the changes or the attitude toward the changes inspiring or faith based.
5,a song for aircraft pilots?,"i have to admit that this album is one of the best albums i have ever heard in my life to be this good. the song ""pilots"" (on a star)is the bomb. this song has the tempo that you would most likely hear in the new james bond movie, and the music video is great. if you want to see the video, click on to launch.com and click new videos. this is the song to get this year."
3,Cute cover.. remixes are mediocre..,"this latest offering by ethereal-sounding Goldrapp has buying power juz because it's by Goldfrapp. the first track is 'pilots' (can be found on her debut album). if u might already know, pilots is seemingly happy-sounding as compared to 'horse tears' or 'deer stop' (my 2 favs).. it's an ok track. the remix of 'lovely head' is eerie enough with her breathy vocals. the tempo is slow-paced n creeps up to a climax. nice n interesting remix. phead's adrain utley lends his hand here in the bass guitar, adding to the flim noirish sound will has produced. as for the 3rd track, it's more of a dance track than Goldfappish. it stinks, really. finally, there is a video in this package, featuring 'pilots'. lovely video.. avant gardish n cool. alison looks gorgeous in there.get this cd only coz it's a LIMITED cd/ u LURRRRRVE Goldfapp/ u wanna watch the vid (...)."
5,Great prep item for the CLEP in Human Development,I am using this book in conjunction with the REA test prep guide. It is a great supplement.
3,Not quite BBC series soundtrack,"This CD set has most of the songs lip-synched in the 1978 BBC series but misses several of its strongest, including ""Blue Moon,"" ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,"" ""Pick Yourself Up,"" and ""Love is the Greatest Thing."" Instead it interpolates ""other songs from the 1930s,"" American recordings by the likes of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire. Not unworthy, though one or two is from a slightly later period. Also, as a low-cost compilation of music in public domain in the EU, this, unlike the official soundtrack album, has no notes or recording information. But it offers most of the musical pleasures from the series that would be hard to find elsewhere, and at a very attractive price."
2,Hardly touched it,Since I had a lot of other resources for pregnancy fitness & healthy eating this book became redundant for me. I was taking the Bradley Method classes which were extremely thorough and I was also doing pregnancy yoga DVD & walking a lot.
1,All reading and unclear pictures,"Usually when I buy an exercise book I expect clear concise directions and maybe a picture to illustrate what exactly the correct form would be. Well, if you are expecting this out of this book you my as well forget it. Although it was very informative, black and white pictures that aren't even shown for all exercises is not going to cut it. For example for a tricep kickback it doesn't really show you the ways that it would be wrong which can lead to an injury. If you are looking for information go for it; but if you want something that will show you the right way with pictures, skip it."
1,BEWARE OF KNOCK OFF'S!!!,"I've been using this product for years and I know what it it suppose to smell and look like. I even noticed the small details on the bottle and compared them to the old bottle with I was still using. This is a ""knock off"" sent and it is advertised as being the real sent! It looks different, smells horrible! I usually get compliments when wearing this sent instead someone told me ""please do not wear it around..."" them! Needless to say I was embaraced and I don't want to wear it anymore! I don't know what to do with it now. Everything is wrong about this product, the color of it, the labeling on it and of course the ""knock off"" fake smell. I am so disappointed in this false advertisement! At least let your customers know it's not the real eau de parfum by Michael kors! This was my first and last time I'm buying it from anywhere else besides the department store! I just wasted money on a junk perfume!Very disappointed,Long time amazon customer"
1,Never got it,"I ordered this for x-mas. It was sent to the wrong address and amazon never help me. Spent $60 and got nothing. Will never order from amazon again. Terrible customer service, and have MAJOR trouble with hackers accessing accounts."
5,LOVE IT!!,I love Fashion Angels! They provided hours of fun for my girls. You can dress them up in all different kinds of outfits. After they were finished they packed everything up in the portfolio that comes with it. Great toy!
4,Solid,"Cummings is one of my favorite R.E. authors. He is very thorough. This one has chapters on conventional and creative financing, tax exchanges, land development, discounting mortgages, sale-leasebacks, how to get started and even dealing with foreclosure. Table of contents is very thorough and makes it very easy to go to the exact page you want to to find specific information. He is good with the numbers and doesnt leave much to the imagination like many authors do. I recommend anything by this author."
5,Very Nice!!!,"This is a great gym bag. I am very happy with it. I also bought the 24"" version of this bag for overnight trips."
5,Unforgetable book,"I first read this book almost 10 years ago and I couldn't put it out of my mind since. I believe that the hero was in fact efter the character from "" The prince "" by Niccolo Machiavelli in everyway. And Machiavelli himself got the inspiration from Ceasare Borgia. I hope this would help the readers who think Domenico was beyond redemtion to understand him a bit better. Under the circumstances, I do believe that Felicia, had tried her best to survive the situation as un educated, no relative, poor, naive as she was.It was either get along with the situation , make the best out of it or take the easiest way out, kill herself. What could she possibly do against the king of her own land? This book was written in a very beautiful prose in my idea ( as a non English speaking person )The story itself was full of plots. It is still a very beautiful story after all these years for me."
2,Wooden characters,"This book was one of the most boring books I have ever read. The heroine went from a believable character to, within a page or two, a wooden predictable, forgettable bore. I found myself thinking this book is so tedious. I hated the first person account. I did not know the hero at all except by her perception. He was horrible through a good bit of the book. It all seemed convoluted. Nothing compared to the angst, etc... of Stormfire. Now I am not a huge fan of Stormfire, but it has this one beat hands down. I only read this book b/c of the recommendations on the romance blogs. This was veeeerrrry disappointing. Do not waste any money on this book."
2,Boring,"I can't even finish this book. It's like reading a history book about the typical and mundane happenings in a medieval court.The romance scenes aren't very descriptive. The characters don't have much personality. The Duke is a spoiled prick, described as some kind of glittery haired bisexual fairy prince who gets everything he wants and who everyone desires. His self-assured attitude is more repulsive than charming.I had higher hopes for Felicia, I mean she was basically drugged at his whim and brought to his court to be a sex slave, and it seems like she was resigned to let things happen to her with that lukewarm fighting spirit.Perhaps if I chose to read more it would have gotten better, but the slow-paced development was irritating and the writing didn't hook me in. This book was recommended to me after reading Stormfire by Christine Monson, which I loved. I was hoping for something dark, passionate, and emotionally gripping like that."
3,The Silver Devil,"This book isn't for everyone.The ""hero"", Domenico sees the heroine Felicia in a window from the street and decides he must have her. He's a powerful man and with the help from her brother, he has drugged and brought to his home. Domenico is not a very good man but I did believe he loved Felicia in his own demented way. I did enjoy the part towards the end where Domenico is humbled and literally brought to his knees by the heroine but he's still a mentally unstable S.O.B.The story kept my interest and it wasn't quite a bad as some reviews made it out to be but be prepared for a harsh anti-hero with bodice ripping galore."
1,Crystal got broken in 2 months,"This watch was kept in cupboard and suddenly part of the crystal got exploded and broken. No hits, no pressure - simply defective product. Skagen doesn't cover this under warranty. Stay away from this product."
3,good value but not good look,"I purchased this watch as a gift, I did not see this in person, I based my decision on photos alone, the watch looks good in terms of spec and the photos make it look good physically, but I did not like it when I received it.I much prefer the value and look of 233XLTTN, it has a blue face with titanium case and band, suer thin, most importantly, it looks great on a many people's skin - I've seen it on white and Asian's wrists, it looks simply beautiful, I'm considering to get one for myself."
1,Crystal I explode single,"Strangely the crital of clock bought recently I explode single without receiving ningun blow.and all this less than two months of use, aquien I can go so that they are responsible for garantia."
2,Cracked crystal problem,"I'm sorry to have to report the same broken crystal. I am quite sure I did not hit it on anything. I think it happened when I came inside from the cold. I looked down, and my desk had broken glass on it, and the face was broken."
3,nice gift,"I bought this watch as a gift... This is a good watch for everyday wear and can be adjusted to fit larger wrists. The only problem I encountered was the way to adjust the band...the directions seemed simple, but I ended up going to jeweler after I bent the pin"
1,"Very dangerous, don't wear around children","I brought this watch six months ago on Amazon. I loved it, very slim and light, althought the dial was larger than I expected. Today I wore the watch to work, parked my car, got out and started to walk to work, and suddenly the whole middle of the crystal fell out. It left a perfect circle on whats left of the crystal, pretty cool. Luckily there was no kids around to step on the shards. Can you imagine if this happened around children and you didn't notice? And to top it all off, the crystal is not covered by the warrenty, the cost to replace it is $25 and $8.95 shipping and handling. $34 to fix a watch I just paid $87 for. Rip off!!!! Do not buy, dangerous product."
1,Faulty Crystal,"I have had two of these watches. On the first one a 1 inch sized disc blew out of the center of the crystal. The relpacement shipped to me did the exact same thing. The first time I was holding an Xbox 360 controller. The second a television remote. I was very careful with this watch. It was not abuse, it is an obvious product defect. I have returned the item all together."
2,Face Exploded,"I've had this watch for 2 weeks now. While it was a great looking watch, and felt nice and light, the face of the watch just cracked open! Now I need to get warranty repair service... which includes sending Skagen a check for return postage.I thought this would be a long-lasting quality time instrument - but it ended up breaking in 2 weeks!"
1,"Beautiful, but LOTS of problems","This watch is very attractive and the materials are of good quality, however, it is VERY poorly made. Right when we received, the strap springbar was coming out of one of the holes because it had not been properly installed. It was a very difficult task to put it in correctly, since the whole watch was made out of titanium. A few months later a large, round part of the crystal simply broke away from the watch without any shock or impact to it. I had actually read bad reviews about the crystal problem before purchasing the watch, but ignored them, since it was such a good looking watch. Don't make the same mistake!"
1,Stay away,"And so I thought that those chrystal problems wouldn't affect me... This watch was kept with silken gloves, and suddenly part of the chrystal just dropped on the floor. No hits, no pressure - simply defective product. The only good thing is that it was so cheap, but on the other hand, it doesn't pay to send it to Skagen because of return postage costs.So don't let the look to fool you."
1,EXPLODING CRYSTAL. WATCH NOW MADE IN CHINA!,"I just returned my watch to Macy's. I've had it for one month. I went to put it on today and noticed that the crystal had popped!A large circular piece of it had fractured around the edges and broken off. The watch has never been dropped or bumped, and was worn about a dozen times. The clerk refunded my money but did not believe that I hadn't bumped it. After reading these posts, I see that this is an extremely common occurrence! Don't buy Skagen! If you look closely and read about Skagen online, you will see that these watches are now made in CHINA! That explains the falloff in quality. Seiko makes a durable and long lasting watch.I recommend you buy one of them."
4,Great product,"I bought this for my mother as a mothers day gift. She loves it and so does my 6 year old cousin. It makes good ice cream and is a fun, easy activity for them to do together. The ice cream maker is loud but that was expected."
5,Great little ice cream freezer!,"I'm very happy with this ice cream freezer. Just made the frozen yogurt recipe that comes with machine, it was a big hit with my family! Freezing time has run about 30 minutes, great machine, great price. I wish the electrical cord was longer but ice cream has frozen before water reached the run off hole every time so it has not been a problem. Easy to use, good instructions & recipes with machine. Great results every time."
5,Great Ice Cream Maker,"Once I read all of the directions and got all of the ingredients, making ice cream was very easy. The recipes that come with the instructions are delicious. I would definitely recommend this ice cream maker to anyone who loves good ice cream."
4,Yummy!,"This is a wonderful Ice Cream Maker! We made the no cook vanilla a few times and it was delicious. It is a noisy device and takes a little longer to complete the process than the literture states, but the result is worth the wait."
5,Hamilton Beach Ice Cream freezer,Works very well.. replaced a 20 year old that has lost some power...It is only automatic in completion ( tongue in cheek)
5,Good Purchase,"After reading many reviews of this product as well as others, I was really confused on what to purchase. My main reasoning for purchasing this item was because of the volume of ice cream that it makes. After making ice cream on several occasions, I am very happy with my choice. It is noisy, but the end result is well worth the noise. The ice cream is very consistent and the maker is easy to clean. The pieces of the ice cream maker also seem to be very sturdy and durable. I certainly recommend this product if you are interested in a large quantity of ice cream as well as good, ready-to-eat cream immediately after it stops."
5,Makes the best ice cream!,"This makes awesome ice cream. Creamy, and perfect ice cream in 30-40 minutes. Absolutely love the quality of this product, especially for under $35. You can't go wrong with this ice cream maker."
3,Mediocre Ice cream Maker,"I bought this ice cream maker because it was inexpensive and made 4-quart batches. But from my experience, this ice cream maker has an under-powered motor. When the ice cream is thick enough to stop the motor from spinning, the contents of the container are still a little drippy, and after the ice cream freezes, it is gritty with little ice-particles instead of turning out smooth. I have made three batches, and at first I thought I wasn't cooking the mix enough, so last time I added an extra egg and made it thicker. It didn't make a difference. I am using recipes from the Ben & Jerry's book, and following the cooking directions that came with the maker (I don't know why, but there are no cooking directions in the Ben & Jerry's book--I made my first batch raw).I think with a more powerful motor, it would spin longer while the mixture freezes for a creamier texture. The bottom line is that I think the motor is too weak to make good ice cream."
1,Broke after one month,"I am so disappointed that this machine broke after just one month. It never stopped after the ice cream was ready like it said it would in the instructions. It made pretty good ice cream, but it should work longer than one month."
3,Just a quarter inch off,"This machine gave me fits until I figured out how to jerry-rig it. In order to work correctly, the metal shaft on the dasher has to fit snugly into the slot in the motor. If it doesn't, there is no churning action since everything moves together, instead of the canister moving and the dasher remaining stationary. I put a small rounded piece of plastic (the stopper from a half-gallon of orange juice) between the canister and the bucket, and then a Chapstick cap on the end of the dasher where it rests on the bottom of the canister. This was enough to push the dasher up into the slot so that the machine churns the ice cream once everything is snapped in place. Other than this annoyance, the machine works very well and is cheap. It makes a huge batch of ice cream. A bag of ice and a box of salt, and you're good to go."
5,as advertised,bought this because of high rating. have used it many times already and it works great every time. I would recommend this to anyone!
2,It didn't work for me,"I bought this machine to make a big portion of icecream.I tried to follow the instruston as written.only difference is that it's vegan icecream so I put soymilk and other non dairy ingredients.I mixed them nearly one hour but didn't make smooth texure,so it ended up having it in a freezer and took out to mix it by hand.the texture got little icy like sobet I couldn't serve it to my guest.after a while I tried to make icecream just by hand.it's much simple and makes one exactry I expected,at no cost.I returned the product and decided not to buy any icecream machine in the future."
2,Motor gears broke after 1 year,I was relying on H-B as a good trade name for this ice cream maker. The gears stripped inside the motor after 14 months. I would expect a better product from Hamilton Beach! It is not worth the $35 price.
1,broke on first use,"We bought this product to replace an old similar HB unit that we thought was about to croak. We loaded up the new machine for the first time and turned it on. It started making a weird sound. We took it apart to find that the machine had destroyed itself before we even got one batch of ice cream. Since it was too late to return it, we threw it away and continued to use the old model which has valiantly refused to die."
4,Good for the money,"It is quite noisy, but it works perfectly fine. I've used it twice and so far good results, even with only using a half recipe as 4 quarts seemed overkill for just two of us. Just a note: if you don't use a full recipe, the motor will NOT shut off when done. I checked it after 30 minutes and it was done. Just remember that the ice cream is going to be more like soft-serve and you need to freeze it for a while if you want it harder."
2,Plastic bucket cracked to smitherines,"We really enjoyed making ice cream last summer with this product. But this summer, when I took it out to use, the plastic bucket was filled with cracks, making it useless. Maybe it was from the salt last year, but I washed it really well before storing it. Not worth the money, in my opinion."
5,HB 68330R 4-Qt ice cream maker.,What can I say! Simple to use/easy to use/ easy to clean/ easy to store... Makes my 115 year old Ice Cream recipeeven better. Every one loves the Maker and ice cream. Hamilton Beach 68330R 4-Quart Automatic Ice-cream Maker from Amazon.com.
4,Hamilton beach ice cream maker,"Works very well for an inexpensive ice cream maker. Motor is fairly loud when mixing, but that is to be expected. Would recommend it to anyone."
4,Makes delicious ice cream!,"Purchased this electric ice cream maker after reading reviews. Takes about 20-25 minutes to make delicious, soft-serve ice cream. Would definitely recommend this machine."
5,Great results,We have only used it twice but have had great results both times. The no cook vanilla recipe is so easy and very creamy!
4,Ice Cream Maker makes a fine bowl of goodness.,The machine worked as advertised. We made perfect soft serve ice cream and it was 100F outside. It sure did the trick. Make sure you follow the recipe to the letter. Too much or not enough of an ingredient will prevent your ice cream from freezing. The machine will seem to run forever! But if you use the right stuff you will indeed enjoy one of the finer things in life!
4,works as expected,we have enjoyed the refreshing snacke made by this product. Powerful enough to do the job as expected and compact.
5,Love it!,"Love it! Bought it to replace the one I've had for the last 23 years. Great bang for the buck! Can't go wrong with this one. Makes great ice cream! Not real loud. Easy to use. What can I say...? Glad I bought it. And, as usual, it arrived sooner than they suggested it would. Hard to beat Amazon's service whether it is coming from them or a second party. Good instructions too. If you've never made home made ice cream, they take you through it step by step. When the motor quit's turning... you're done! Good wide base for stability in transport.I have to say the shipping was a little more than expected. But, you really can't beat it for the price."
2,dinky ice cream maker,"guess I got what I paid for. entire apparatus is pretty dinky, lightweight, thin. the 1 gal aluminum freezer can had a dimple in the top rim - never could figure if it was supposed to be bent like that or was simply damaged at the factory; I was afraid that salt would leak into the bent rim, but it didn't. The cheesy operator manual didn't say anything about it. It took 45 minutes to make ice cream with this rig, and that was barely frozen. spend a few more bucks and get a better quality ice cream maker with a better insulated ice bucket."
2,works for a while,"Bought this at the beginning of summer. Used it about 10 times, now it has stopped turning consistently. Just started another batch of ice cream and it needed help to keep turning. It finally stopped completely before the mix was frozen."
4,Good Ice Cream Maker,"Comes with a booklet of ice cream recipes. I followed the instructions and the ice cream came out great. It did take longer than the instructions stated (about twice as long) but that may have been because of the high temperature.My father had a Hamilton Beach ice cream maker years ago and this is similar although it is much lighter in weight. I'll know more when I see how long the motor lasts but so far, so good!"
2,Warning: Vendor doesn't bother boxing this item,"This product arrived at our house without ANY packaging or outside box. The Hamilton Beach box was damaged, and someone had just taken a shipping label and stuck it on the box. It is a Christmas gift, and we are lucky we came home through a different door--or my son's request to Santa would have been spoiled. I am not yet sure whether the machine works, or how good it is...will try to update."
5,"If it isn't broke, don't fix it.","A time tested way to make homemade ice cream. These units have had the same designs for decades, for a good reason. They still work great. Easy to use and durable!"
2,Worked great before it died :),This machine worked once. Tried it a second time and the motor burned out. Returned it and bought a different kind.
5,works great,"It works fine, It makes allot of ice cream. We use it every week to make our own instead of buying it."
5,Hamilton Beach Ice Cream Maker,The ice cream maker is exactly what I wanted. I am completely satisfied with my purchase.
3,"I'm sure it does it's job, but way too big",Really? Who has room for this? And who has time to use actual ice with this thing?I returned this and watched for the Cuisinart Ice-21 which is an acceptable size (live in NY so every little bit of space counts) and you just pop the cuisinart bowl in the freezer and no ice to make.I'm beginning to question ever getting an ice cream maker though. I'm hoping to find some more economical ways to make ice cream because heavy cream and sweetened condensed milk can be expensive.
3,Ice Cream Maker,Used if with regular salt and Ice cream came out great tasting but a little liquidly. We were also very eager and couldn't wait any longer better the next day. It was a gift they enjoyed it very much.
2,Too expensive to make ice cream,The product seems well enough made but it costs more than one can purchase ice cream already made to made homemade. If one just wants to have fun with the kids or grandkids I assume it might be worth purchasing but if one is interested in costs I would say no.
4,Satisfied,The one I received functions perfectly well and makes great ice cream. It's easy to maintain and cleans up easily. What more can you ask of any ice cream maker.
5,worked great,Didn't have time to order one so I borrowed my mom's. It worked great. In less than an hour I had made two gallons of ice cream with this freezer. I'll be purchasing one of my own.
4,Great value-great performer,"I bought this to take on a church outing-there were 4 other ice cream makers at the gathering and this one out performed them all. The recipe book that came with the machine is great too. We are addicted to the blueberry yogurt- it is so yummy. A reviewer commented that the canister was made of light material...while it isn't made of super heavy material, I think that it is adequate for this machine. Just remember to use enough ice and salt as stated in the instruction manual. We may ""graduate"" to a more expensive ice cream maker at some point in time but for now, this machine does the job."
2,Should have spent more...,Ice cream is a bit too runny.Cheap plastic construction seems like it is destined to break soon.Made in China.
1,waste of money,"I purchased this ice cream maker as a backup for my old one, a Rival that's performed well over the years. First batch of ice cream, I shut down the operation when the motor began to lug, as instructed in the manuel, and discovered a 1-inch rime of frozen ice cream with a totally liquid center. The paddle had not remained firm while the can turned--it had not 'churned' the mixture. Two things resulted: eventually the paddle froze to the sides of the tin and the motor slowed, and the pressure stripped the insert where the paddle fits into the motor. End of ice cream maker. I reblended the ice cream and rechurned it in the 30-year-old maker. Turned out great. Cost of returns being what they are, I'm going to get a good deal more satisfaction taking this dandy new HB Ice Cream Maker to the alley and beating it to death with my ice hammer. What a waste of time and money."
3,Didn't actually use it,"I didn't actually use it, so it may be a fine product. I wanted to be able to make my own GAPS friendly home ice cream, and after I ordered this I realized that the cuisinart didn't require the rock salt and ice, so it would be just a little easier. So I ended up returning this and getting the cuisinart. It was only slightly more expensive and worth it for me to be less hassle."
2,It's very bulky and more expensive than buying ice cream,"We originally bought this to make our own ice cream using raw milk, but the amount of sugar and rock salt required to make the ice cream was much more than we expected. It's cheaper to buy ice cream than make it ourself."
5,Great family freezer and pleaser!,"This new ice cream maker is wonderful--much easier and faster than the ones we used when I was a kid growing up. And after a thorough search and price comparison, I found the cost was much less than many other brands and types of ice cream makers. My new husband's family (who had never had homemade ice cream before) enjoyed my old family recipe for fresh fruit sherbet at a big family celebration for two birthdays in the family soon after I bought it. Needless to say, it was a very big hit! As they said, they never knew what they had been missing!!"
4,Yum!!,LOVE THIS!! I can now make all the different flavors I have dreamed of. The process is short and the outcome is delicious.
1,vastly underpowered and badly engineered,"i bought this because the last hamilton beach ice cream maker lasted for a couple of years of weekly use. but this one is very weak, hardly turns, and the moment ice starts forming on the sides it stops turning. that's perhaps 10 minutes of stirring, which is useless. i have adjust the ice/salt level several times, and as i say i've been making ice cream weekly for several years, so i know what i'm doing, and this machine just sucks."
1,Very bad product,The motor was not strong enough to turn the cylinder that contained the ice cream mix. It just ran and ran with freezing around the edge of the container next to the ice and salt combination. Nothing was turning. This is one very bad product. As they say you get what you pay for and this was one big mistake.
2,"Worked at first, then quit","We had gotten this maker a few years ago. We make ice cream about once a year and it worked the first two times, but when we tried it this year, the motor gave out. :("
5,great ice cream,This ice cream maker is better than expected. It worked quickly and did a beautiful job. [...] made connoli ice cream and today we're making coconut lime. Delish!!
4,this is unbelievable..,its so easy to use .. its a little inconvenient in size but makes up for it in ice cream .. lovely
4,Tried 2 Recipes,"At first we tried the more elaborate vanilla recipe which calls for eggs, and my sister didn't follow the directions about when to add the eggs and we ended up with vanilla ice cream with bits of boiled egg throughout it! So, be careful on that recipe. Tossed that and made the easy vanilla recipe + orange juice concentrate and the recipe never seemed to finish although I kept adding salt and ice. But, popped it in the freezer to finish and it came out delicious. It tastes exactly like an orange creamsicle. It makes a lot of ice cream so it's worth the purchase."
4,Great Ice Cream Maker!,"I had never tried to make ice cream before this machine, and it works great! Obviously, you need rock salt to make it work, but that can be cheaply purchased here at Amazon or at most grocery stores. I was torn between several ice cream makers and am glad I went with this one since it's easy to use, makes great ice cream super quickly, and was an unbeatable price for its quality. I can usually whip up a batch of fresh ice cream in 30-50 minutes using ingredients I have on hand in my fridge. The motor does make a noise but it doesn't bother me; you actually need to hear a little noise so that you'll know when it stops churning. If it was silent, I'd have to stay in the room with it to see when it was done! Overall, very pleased with this machine."
4,Great machine for low price!,"I bought this for my husband because on our last move we had to leave behind out ice cream maker. We've used it twice and LOVE it! It is quite loud, like all machines. We actually run ours in the extra bathroom just sitting in the tub :) It works exactly like it should. The recipes we've tried from the booklet are so-so, but that has no impact on the quality of the product.One additional note - the ice cream stays SO creamy and never hardens or crystalizes when kept in the container and stored in the freezer. Keeps moisture and air out much better than our old one! Love this and would recommend it to anyone!"
2,works fine but wears out easily,"Made good ice cream for a season or two, but then the motor stopped working. It may be due to the salty ice environment, but I expect more longevity. Will try another brand."
2,Motor Died,"The first two times I made ice cream, it turned out great. When I tried for the third time, the motor wouldn't run."
3,Why can't I just buy a DVD?,"I'd love to own this movie. And my complaint isn't that you made it available in full-frame, nor is it with the price. But I want to watch it on my TV, without having to buy new devices, new connectors...Sorry. But on-demand sucks if I don't have the option of burning a single DVD copy."
3,Fantasy movie not real for the most part,"This was a fantasy movie, not really something that would happen in real Life. No one would take pictures of dead people like this, the idea is pure fantasy and that irks me a bit. And he wanted to have a showing in ""The museum of Modern Art"". Well anyone that knows art, knows that is for some abstract paintings and not pictures of real people in documentary shots. Interesting, but really not a documentary but some kind of fantasy. Where this saint of a photographer was able to escape the mafia, hardly likely again, the only question is where the writer got his ideas, more succinctly-- out of a cracker jack box. The film as a whole isn't bad, if you don't mind feeling like you have the mind of a 10 year old."
1,"Thought I bought new,but got used.",The one I received was obviously a return or floor sample.The box was totally destroyed.The dragon itself was filthy and the wings were messed up.Not satisfied at all.Was to be a Christmas present...now I have to find something else.
2,"Imaginative, but disappointing","The premise behind ""The King in the Window"" is intriguing -- window wraiths, living in windows, battling the Master of Mirrors with the help of a boy king. From a ""New Yorker"" writer, however, I'd expect more tightly-written, lively prose -- this book was poorly edited (I'd stumble over at least one disjointed, multi-comma'd phrase each page when reading aloud), and worse, condescending to readers of any age. Think plot summaries every few pages and constant check-ins in question form (""What would Oliver do now?"")."
3,The King in the Window,"Adam Gopnik lived in Paris for several years, writing delightful pieces for The New Yorker about his experiences, later published in book form: From Paris to the Moon. Many of them were about raising his young son in a foreign country. This children's book clearly draws on that experience and for me, as an American who lived and studied in France for many years (slightly earlier)the descriptions of French schools and customs (such as the galette des rois on Epiphany) were quite amusing. I also liked the way in which the author incorporated historical ""lessons"" about Versailles and the French literati into the narrative in a non-didactic manner. The scene where the young boy took a curmudgeonly author to dinner in a fancy restaurant with 100 euros in pocket was very entertaining. I have not yet finished the book. I do feel that it is a bit long-winded, and am not sure as to how much appeal it would have for children themselves (other than the author's children)."
4,The King in the Window,"The King in the Window is a great work of art. It reminds me of several books wrapped into one, like perhaps Narnia meets Where the Wild Things Are. The concepts are original and the characters are real . This was a really good read."
4,King in the Window,"My granddaughter was reading the book so I read it too. Great book for kids, entertaining, exciting and it has a good message.Love you JordanGramma"
1,Not a very good book,"I did not enjoy The King in the Window. I wanted to because I went to Paris once and liked it and because I do like fantasy books, but the truth is, I could barely finish the book. The writer should have spent more time making his characters more believable and less time showing off all his knowledge. No character was believable at all! I know this was supposed to be a fantasy book, but nothing at all felt real to me. This isn't really a book for kids. It's more like what an adult THINKS a book for kids should be![...]."
5,Very good,"These replacement sensors work perfectly in most cases and I save a boatload by purchasing them on Amazon. Excellent product, thank you."
3,From the back cover:,"To the lonely little rich girl Olivia Prescott, the servents' son, Reeves Talbot, had been the one true treasure in her opulent New Orleans household. But ambitious Reeves had a chip on his shoulder the size of the St. Charles Avenue mansion, and an ironclad restraint towards its innocently adoring princess.But now, years later, the mighty Prescotts have fallen, and Reeves Talbot himself occupied their once-proud palace and he was ready to do more than admire Olivia from afar.Long had she loved Reeves. She loved him still. But if she surrendered to his conquering touch, would he cherish the tender prize of her passion or merely flaunt it as his final trophy?"
3,Really Small Pan,"My daughter had a request to bake a cake to resemble a bowling ball for our friend's 50th birthday. The pan is the perfect shape however, extremely small. It is good for children's cakes on a small scale. Don't expect it to be the true size if you are doing a full size cake."
3,"Good looks, but cooks unevenly","I made this cake for my daughter's birthday. The middle of the cakes took much longer to cook than the directions indicated. It did make 2 nice half circles though for show (which was all I really wanted). I did cut into one after the party and I don't think it was completely cooked. Maybe I used too much batter? Still, it was perfect size and shape for what I needed."
2,Cake takes forever to bake,"Perhaps it's the quality of this pan (really thin, cheap looking material) or the shape, but it takes forever to bake a cake in it. The directions say 325 degrees, 30-40 min, depending on your recipe. My recipe called for exactly that. So I set the timer for 35 minutes. Over an hour later, the inside of the cake is not done, but the outer part of the cake is overdone. I'm still in the process of baking and am so frustrated, I had to write a review right now. Perhaps after it cooks and is decorated, I'll feel better, but be prepared for the frustration of baking your cake to doneness."
3,Serves its purpose,"I wanted to make a sphere cake and this tin did the job. The directions for baking are a little off though - omitting too much oil from the cake recipe makes the the cake much too dense. And a whole box of cake mix split evenly between the two tins works fine (the directions call for less batter) And it took like an hour and twenty minutes to bake!!! The directions say something like 40 mins.But, in the end, I ended up with a perfectly round cake, which is what I wanted."
1,Not Impressed,"I was dissapointed when I recieved this Wilton Sports Ball Pan. Read the dimensions! I actually did not realize how small it would be. Also, very poor quality. Metal is very flimsy and the sides are not even flush. I will stick with Nordicware pans only from now on."
3,"Require a lot of playing around with before using, but eventually work.","The instructions for filling and baking do not work as promised, so here's a simple solution to get what you want. Follow the cake mix baking instructions as they are,, and the pan baking instructions as they are, and place the pans on a large cookie sheet; one large enough to catch the batter that will bake over the top and spill over. During baking, if the outside surface appears to be baking a lot faster than the inside (usually the case), then reduce the temperature by 10 degrees. I just let them bake until completion, cool entirely in the pans, and then trimmed off the excess. Used these pans to make the head of Jack Skellington for a Halloween-themed birthday party for my 9 year-old niece. Worked great, but I had to have about 4 practice runs with these pans before I could get it right."
5,Wilton Sports Ball Pan Set,The Wilton Sports Ball Pan Set was very easy to use and the golf ball cake I made turned our very nice. I am well pleased with this purchase!
2,Too small,I'm sure this product would be great if you are doing golf balls or something but the size of this pan is way to small for a normal sports ball. I purchased this to do a basketball cake but its way to small for that
3,not quite sphere,Followed directions and filled pan to required level and still had to use an additional layer of cake to make a perfect circle. The cakes turned out great with no sticking.
2,ball cake pan,"This is WAY too small for my purposes. When I ordered a sports ball pan I assumed it would be the actual size of a soccer or basketball. It is probably only an 8"" diameter and the description should say that."
4,Fantastic!,"I've seen some people complain about the size, but it makes an entire cake mix--as in a full sized cake. It seems small because it's a different size than people are used to. I absolutely LOVE these pans! I had no problems getting the cakes to bake all of the way through (and evenly!) and they came out easily, as well. All of your friends will be super impressed when you turn out a spherical cake!"
4,Ball Pan Set easy to use.,These pans were just what I needed for a special cake. I bit pricey for the light weight aluminum pans.
4,Wilton Sports Ball Pan Set,I made a tennis ball and had no problems with removing from the pan. The directions did not advise how to 'put together both halves'. Directions did say to add corn syrup to 1/4 cup of icing but never stated it was to put between both halves to put together. I did use the corn syrup icing to adhere both sides and it worked fine
3,"love the idea, product is very small","i have made a couple of round cakes with this gadget, and they always amaze people. but the size of the ball is very small, maybe 4 or 5 inches in diameter. i wish they had a bigger one!"
2,CHANGED MY MIND.,"Yeh, i really don't like this game now, firstly it isn't very good for the eyes and secondly it gets boring after afew short plays on the game. Realy cant rate games because some do get really boring after a while of playing on them. The good to this game is the amazing graphics nd the rolarcoasters. Thebad is that once you have built one that you are in charge of, you ride it colse up but no people seen or not a theme park just a rolarcoasterthat is built only. Although there are the props,the extras on the themepark. Would recomend for a child only otherwise an older person might get bored of it after the first few plays on the game."
5,Hold on to your lunch,"I recomend this to everone in the world. It is for thrill seakers of every age. It's got every thing from wooden, steel& the new inverted roller coasters. You get 6 environments to choose from and various styles of cars. It's rated E for everyone and it's vary cheap. this game is only compatable for windows 95/98/ME/XP CD. so hold on to your lunch and buy Roller Coaster FACTERY 2."
2,Been there done that....,"gameplay:4(poor)graphics:8(great)sound:7(good)value:4(poor)tilt:5(moderate)overall:5.4(moderate)This game gets boring very very quick,unless you are a person who wants to make a billon coasters becuase right after you build your coaster and get good judgement it gets pointless to play that coaster again and the challege mode has stuiped storylines,So you are paying about $[...]-$[...] for playing something for about an hour (and I played this before like a year ago or maybe more!),you have no people who buy tickets and ride it and see if they have a good or bad time,you dont even see the judges in the cart!Although the game has great graphics and good sound,it is realy pointless to buy this game,if you realy want to build a coaster (never played it but i bet it is 10x better) get roller coaster tycoon or better yet save the money to buy zoo tycoon 2 or even mall tycoon and etc..."
4,Fun for the whole family,"I bought this game for my 5 year old son who loves roller coasters. It took him awhile to figure it out, but he is now building and riding the coasters on his own (with some help from me of course). I have used it too, and it is alot of fun. It did take more computer than I thought though, as it will not run on the kids '98 vintage Pentium II computer. Overall alot of fun and a good value for the price."
1,this game sucks.. invest in roller coaster tycoon instead,"i bought this game and it was VERY disappointing. it is a lot more difficult than roller coaster tycoon to design a ride. it is diffuclt to visualize the coaster, and riding it isnt all that special. im not sure if i had a bad box, but it also didnt contain ANY directions or booklets. this made it a bit difficult to figure out how to design the coaster. if youre an avid RCT2 fan, dont bother with this game"
5,"Excellent product, quick shipping!","Purchased this sink for my kitchen renovation. I love how deep it is, it can almost be used as a double!Beautiful finish & easily cleaned!"
2,Side zipper broke after a couple uses.,After a few uses the side zippers broke and it's been hard to fix or replace the zipper. Didn't get alot of use out of it.
3,The Man From Atlantis - Judith McWilliams,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERJENNA FARRON: ARCHAEOLOGIST IN SEARCH OF A LOVE LIFEThese days, eligible, attractive, single men weren't exactly coming out of the woodwork! So when Jenna stumbled across a gorgeous male specimen, she couldn't let a mere ten-thousand-year age difference interfere with romance! Besides, everyone knows older men are sexy!KYNAN: DISPLACED CITIZEN IN SEARCH OF ATLANTISReturning to the lost civilization wouldn't be easy. This world was bursting with tantalizing delights: chocolate, television and Jenna. Kynan had expected the sexy creature to turn him in to her government--not turn him on in her bedroom!"
4,Herreweghe is great.,"This is a wonderful recording of Mozart's Mass in C minor. However three out of the four soloists are a bit light in vocal weight for my taste. That is why I don't give it five stars. Jennifer Larmore is the exception, because she has a Mozart voice. The alto soloist is really a soprano in terms of what Mozart asks her to do. This piece is some of Mozart's best work, and it gets good recognition from Herreweghe. Herreweghe is such a great conductor. Listen to the bowing in the strings and the diction from the chorus. He also gets a variety of vocal colors out of the chorus. Only the great choral conductors can inspire the chorus to make such haunting sounds. In my opinion Herreweghe is even better with early music such as Bach, Josquin, Monteverdi and Lully to name a few. This is still a great performance because it represents what people heard during Mozart's time."
5,"Everything you need to know, nothing you don't","What a breath of fresh air! Wotring and Potter take the reader from a definition of integrity monitoring and fundamental principles to the pragmatic ""how to"" implement a monitoring capability - step by step. They clearly have a wealth of experience shown by their tips on what to do and what not to do. If you are considering Osiris or Samhain, this book is invaluable! The time you save and the capability you develop will pay for the book many times over!"
5,Great Price,This item is the same as name brand Benadryl. Works the same as the CVS brand which I was using. Quality is good and the price is right.
4,Diphenhydramine,This product works just as well as Benadryl but does not make you as sleepy as Benadryl. Can be taken during the day without feeling drousy.
3,Cheaper at Costco,I was going to buy these but found a bottle of 600 tabs for about $6.50 with tax at my local Costco. Wal-Mart carries them but they are priced at $4.00 for 150 tabs. Either way if you don't have a club card this is a good deal if you do best to use it.The product is great works just like the name brand.
5,Good product and great price,You cant beat the price. I have terrible allergies and these make good sleep aids.Received promptly and product just as described.
3,Effective but CAUSE MAJOR DROWSINESS,"Of course, in hindsight, I should have realized that if the product didn't specify ""NON-DROWSY"" that it may cause drowsiness, but I also kind of assumed that ""warning: May cause drowsiness"" would be in one of the product's descriptions.The pills definitely work, but they will knock you out relatively quickly."
5,Really Works,"I have a hard time getting to sleep and this has helped significantly. On a normal night just one tablet works perfectly to help me relax and get some rest with no grogginess at all in the morning. Taking more than one does result in some grogginess for me, but it's definitely worth it in order to get some sleep.The pills do dry me out some, especially in the winter with the dry air. Again, however, I think it's definitely worth it."
5,Great for pets with allergys also!!!!!!,"My dog has allergy's(the same as we humans can get)and she also was getting rash spots due to them also until her vet told me to start giving her this,she can take it up to 3 times aday if needed.I've been doing as directed by her vet for almost 2 yrs. now and she is doing really great because of it,my sister Kim's dog also takes this for the same reasons after her vet also put her on it and has helped out greatly also.If your pet also has dry/flakey skin and scratches and their fur is dull,you need to ask your vet if your pet can take this and fish oil capsules,it also works true wonders."
2,Great Product High Price,I purchased this item off of Amazon thinking it was a really good deal for 400 tablets of generic Benadryl. As I was walking through my local Sam's club (Members Mark is Sam's private brand) I discovered this price is anything but good. The same exact package was on the shelf for $3.28. If you have a membership to Sam's club save yourself the time and money and purchase it there.Also it took 7 days to get my shipment even with Amazon Prime.The product itself is really good. It is the same active ingredient in name brand Benadryl. This is perfect for my dog who has spring/summer allergies. It works really nicely because it is in a bottle instead of the blister packs that the smaller count Benadryl packages.
4,What can you say.,"I used these when I got poison ivy. The swelling and itching went away, but they made me very tired. It was a good trade off overall. Take em with coffee I guess."
2,they dont work as well,they really dont work well as benadryl as i thought they would could have just bought benadryl thank you muc
2,Disappointing,"After finding the Merck Index an invaluable reference over the decades, I purchased the Merck Manual. Unlike the Index, the Manual has virtually no supportive references for its claims. The Manual can only be viewed as a most rudimentary ""reference"" book for the relatively ignorant laymen. Entering terms into a Google search would prove a better use of your time than reading this ersatz Merck effort."
4,health,I have found this book to be well written for everyone to understand and I refer to it often.
1,Not what I expected from the description.,Totally confusing and as someone mentioned before a dumb down book I agree.Complete waste of my time.
2,"Poor quality, feels rough",This laundry bag is made of a very rough plastic material that feels extremely cheap and abrasive to the hands. It's one step above using a trash bag.
2,Disapointed,"Very fast shipping from KEH Camera.Flash made in JAPAN.Bought this as I am a believer in SUNPACK quality.This unit was introduced in 1996 and the unit I got may have been made in 2003. No power adapter came with unit. Spent $45 for flash and the power adapter is another $45.Fair value for a power zoom unit.Tested the cycle rate, with fully charged NiMH took 8 seconds between flashes. I will not buy this unit again.12/6/11"
1,Muy Mal vendedor,"Muy mal vendedor, compre un flash para nikon y me envia uno para minolta y me trae gastos extras y demoras en mi compra"
1,connection problems,"Cable is made of small gauge wire and the HDMI connections seem to lose contact every once in a while. I have to jiggle the cable to regain the connection. I payed a little more for a new cable and solved the problem, so I'm pretty sure the cable was the problem."
3,Could be a little warmer,"I've always used an Expodisk for color balance, but wanted to try a target. I used it a few times on actual jobs and found that if I was using my own available lighting, the Expodisk was easier and had better color results. It seems fine for natural light situations, but I wish it produced a warmer color."
1,Totally NOT worth the calories!,"These wafers are a good idea if your plan is to use them in place of another snack, but just to use as a fiber supplement in addition to what you are already eating, these wafers are not tasty enough to be worth 120 calories! I'd much rather drink the Metamucil mix and have an Oreo 100 calorie pack for the same effect and same total calories, plus it would taste better. Even just based on flavor, these are not very good..."
1,this is NOT a good value,"This offer is for 12 tubs for $39.99, an average of $3.33 per tub. I can get them individually at the grocery store for $1.39, or 12 for $16.68. This price is a complete and total ripoff!!!! Save your cash, buy them at the store!!!"
1,Don't even bother.,"The texture doesn't match my car's interior, and the faceplate is too small for my Pioneer P4200! Buy the Scosche LS2075B Lexus Dash Kit instead!"
5,Blushing Hibiscus,"After more than 50 years in West Virginia, my friend of 30 years moved to Florida. I sent the hibiscus to her so that she would have something to remember me by. She told me the plant was absolutely gorgeous, and on the second day of her receiving it, it burst into even more flowers. She has planted it near her pool and it is doing great. I happen to be a swimmer, so the pool location is most appropriate. I am definitely very pleased with my purchase, and that it brought so much pleasure to a very dear friend."
1,These Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Toys are the WORST I've ever bought,"This Binocuscope is as effective as making little circles with your fingers and looking thru those. Look thru them and see things NORMALLY. To see far away you are to hold the vertical and look thru only one lens. Neither lens will magnify what your looking at. There is a push button for phrases but that is all you get here, and that ain't enough.Sneaking it away from my 3 year old with autism to return it was like mission impossible and the second pair I purchased is no better.This ENTIRE LINE of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse toys is AWFUL and DO NOT function correctly. I am very angry and annoyed with this."
1,One of the worst toys ever.,"What is the point of a microscope or a pair of binoculars if they don't actually magnify anything? Of course, you don't find out that they don't magnify anything until you open them and read the instructions. Why would they even bother to make this garbage?"
2,Ok..,"Book didn't keep my attention at all. Had heard of this case and saw the movie but the book was a bore. If you want to know about this case, I'd find the movie"
3,"good product, but they really need to work on the whole ""perfume free"" odor....","Though, I am impressed with the satisfactory job these dryer sheets do, as far as getting clothing softer and less staticky, I am not impressed with the slightly sour smell that they leave your dried laundry with. It's a little on the chemical side, and I wasn't impressed. I think they need to go back to the laboratory, to work on this."
1,No added perfume does not mean fragrance free,There was a slight smell to these sheets. To me it was not pleasant or unpleasant. It was an improvement over most dryer sheets.Fragrance is not why I was unhappy with my purchase. The clothes were not soft when I took the out of the dryer. The bath towels were especially rough and scratchy.I would not recommend these to any one. Ever.
2,strange odor for scentless,"I've had the same experience with the scent-free bounce. It smells strange out of the box, and when heated in the drier there is a strong chemical gas smell coming out of the dryer vent. It smells toxic. This hasn't happened with every box--only boxes bought recently. Did they reformulate and ruin a good thing? The laundry then smells musty and strange--not a pleasant experience especially when using towels and sheets."
5,Mouse-lovers Delight!,Perfect for mouse-lovers everywhere. The workmanship of these delicate earrings can't be fully captured on film. Even the stud clasp is excellent quality.
3,Only for fish that can eat harder food,"Only some of my bigger tropical fish like the crisps, so I doubt that I would purchase such a product again, in large quantity."
1,Very Poor,"Slim Jim Meat Sticks, Hot Beef and Cheese, 1.5-Ounce Packets in 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)Both boxes were out of date could not eat any of them gave them to the dogs.I was very dissappoited in the products."
1,Product Out Of Date -- Horible,"After reading other reviews where they said product was out of date, I decided to order this. I thought Amazon would surely have taken the out of date product out of their warehouse by now, but they did not. I actually tried to eat a bite of one of the out of date items, it is was absolutely disgusting. They sent me a replacement order, and the replacement order had the same expiration date as my first order. Now to get a refund. I don't want any more of this!"
1,Disappointing,"These were nearly 2 months past the expiration date. The cheese was almost rock hard and the meat was squishy. I've bought a lot of stuff from the Amazon grocery and I've never gotten anything like this. I'm disappointed in Amazon for selling expired food, especially after other reviews had already pointed it out. I only ordered because I thought that Amazon surely would have fixed the problem after others complained. But I did get a refund a few hours after sending them an email, at least Amazon still has good customer service."
4,Solid but light on the Bollywood sound,"This CD is more Africa than India, although the music is a blend of both. I heard it first on NPR and the music I remember from that show seemed more aggreeable than what was on the CD when I finally got it. Technically impressive, beautifully executed, but less likely to make your dance in your seat than I expected."
5,WORKS GREAT,USE STEP DRILLS ON A DAILY BASIS.THESE ARE THE BEST.THEY SEEM TO LAST THE LONGEST.WORTH THE EXTRA COUPLE OF DOLLARS
4,Just What They Look Like,"We use these for basic stained glass windowing, and they work quite well. I'm not an expert, but these seem to be quite good for the price."
3,Toe box is too long-looks elf-like. Otherwise well made and comfortable. I returned mine.,"These shoes are well made with high quality leather and gorgeous off your feet. They run true to size and are very comfortable for such a tall boot. However when I put them on, the toe box was too long (probably why they are so comfortable) and my size 11 feet looked even bigger than they are. The shape of the pointed toe looked elf-like to me. The calf opening fit nicely-It wasn't too wide like most calf-length boots I've tried on. I hate to send back such a nice comfortable shoe, but they just don't look great on. I returned them."
4,Charming work of light historical fantasy,"This tale of magic and courtly intrigue is set in a alternative, magical Regency England, a time period that lends itself well to stories of romance as well as gentle adventure. It features a typically Wrede-ian heroine (read: plucky, intelligent, and down-to-earth) and a huge cast of supporting characters, some menacing, some mysterious, and some just plain ridiculous. The plot is brisk and interesting. A great novel for young and young-at-heart."
2,An unimpressive effort,"I was not at all impressed by this book-- its overly complex plot and dull cardboard characters are hardly improved by the author's heavy reliance on the Regency romances of Georgette Heyer, from which Wrede appears to have borrowed both characters and language (I found one sentence that appears to have been lifted virtually without change from Heyer's ""Cotillion."") The book reads as if it were assembled from a kit. I would not recommend it"
3,Could have been better,"I guess I wasn't expecting the ending to be like an Agatha Christie novel, with long-winded speeches about who did what and why. That was a little bit boring, and a disappointment. If the ending were a little less crowded it would have been a better book. The rest I liked, especially the characters of Kim and Hunch."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,I have to recommend this book to anyone who is searching for a book that includes a strong female character whose main goal is NOT to get the man. Kim is gutsy and tough and not too stupid to take advantage of a good opportunity when it presents itself. Perhaps not the deepest novel ever written I enjoyed ever minute I was immersed in the story and was sad when it came to an end. Please put this and other Patricia Wrede in middle school libraries so that young girls have positive characters to identify with.
3,"a little fantasy, a little mystery for the young adult","This is a nice light fantasy/mystery aimed at the young adult market, but shouldn't be limited to that market. Adults will find it a quick easy and relaxing read. Younger readers might have difficulty with the lower class British language of Victorian England (cockney and street cant/slang) - even I wondered what some of the slang terms meant. Not as good as the Dealing with Dragons series but nice.my ratings: 1-don't bother, 2-get from the library only, 3-nice read, get it from the library or buy it, 4- buy it, read it, 5- a must read, BUY IT!"
1,Extremely disappointed,"I received this as a birthday gift. I saw the bracelet online and sent the link to my parents as a suggestion. Couldn't have been more disappointed when I opened it. Extremely tiny and lightweight. I feel terrible my parents paid so much money for this trinket. I'm hoping for a refund, just feel too guilty wearing it."
4,Reference book - part of a complete biblical commentary,The book is excellent - a party of Holman commentary on the whoile Bible.It is well written and the format lends itself to serious Bible study and very helpful in teaching. I have met the author of this volume on several occasions and have had the pleasure of hearing him preach several times.Knowing the author is a plus.
1,Amazon has incorrect information about this item,Amazon says this is a 512mb memory module that is pc2700 type. And they include a manufucturer (Crucial) part number CT6432P335 which is a 256mb 100pin memory module that is used in some printers and other devices (but not in laptop or desktop computers). Clearly Amazon has a screwed up description for this item calling it a 512mb memory module and that has lead to disapointment. Only order it if you want a 256mb PC2700 100 Pin module.
3,A good primer,"This is a very good beginner's primer on the Roosevelt elk in Olympic National Park. The pictures are beautiful of elk at all stages of life. However, it is a slim book written with the average Park visitor in mind, some good tidbits but not alot of meat. If you're looking for a true hardcore book on the Roosevelt keep looking but go ahead and add this primer to your library as it's references to scientific papers are invaluable."
2,Attempting the Impossible,"Lazlo trys, probably as well as anyone, to use science, his rational mind and a touch of intuition, to explain all of creation. These tools cannot do the job. If only Lazlo had juxaposed his generally well thought out theories with appropriate passages from ancient scriptures, then he would have shown us how well today's science can be used to explain creation. For some reason, scientists are loathe to make specific references to, say, the Vedas. Seems that scientists are totally committed to using their relatively crude tools to penetrate into the mysteries of life, but without much success."
2,Science vs. assumption,"I can put the content of this book in short as familiar saying goes: The more I know, the more I know I don't know.Entertaining reading can occupy time and scratch intellect. I would not bet on it's usefulness in every day living. References to many mystics as proof for theories about unified field of consciousness is not convincing for none of them had achieved the highest goal of the mystic save Jesus Christ Himself, but author don't go that far. You will not find ""the secret"" here that will change your life.So it is up to you, either way: to-buy-or-not-to-buy will do."
2,Disappointing,This is a collection of experiences from different people. It's a re-hash of what anyone interested in the subject has already read. I wouldn't buy it again nor would I recommend it to anyone.
5,Outstanding,"This is truly a great book. It is logical but it is a different form of science book. True this book is not technical, but I do not think that was the intention. This book is more of the beginning of understanding a series of scientific realizations that will play important roles in Human life, society and evolution. Overall I am very happy with the outlook of the author and his work."
4,"Science and the Akashic Field, Ervin Laszlo","Written in an easy to read and understand method, I found this book to be very helpful in understanding quantum mechanics how it affects the human race."
5,"Maria was a brave and courageous lady, and a great friend.","As a young boy, I had the privilege of knowing Maria Linke as a neighbor of her sister when she lived in the small town of Emlenton, Pennsylvania. She was an amazing woman. She shared her personal war time experiences with friends, neighbors, church groups and all who wanted to know the truth of wars devastating toll on humanity. Her book details the events of her life as a prisoner of the Russians during the war. It is a story of immense faith. After reading the book, you will wish that you had an opportunity to know her and her family first hand."
3,"A ""good"" enough book, but......","It contains much historical information on both the soviet union and germany, I enjoy most of it. However unless you are prepared to be lectured on the author's deep religious beliefs, which become ever more frequent the more you read. repetitionafter repetition, it's probably going to be a big turn off for the average reader. I knew this before I bought it and figured I could live with it. Other than this issue, it's going to be refreshing to read."
3,Power?,If your looking for flexibility this is ok. If your looking for power and challenging exercises look somewhere else. If your looking for relaxation look somewhere else as the poses are ok but they move way to fast. youll barely get into position before moving on to the next. love yoga but theses disks are for the beginer.
4,need matrix,I am only rating 4 star because of lack of matrix. otherwise as a long time yoga and yee fan absolutely love this workout.
3,A little slow,"While a lot of other people wrote that this is a really good workout, I have found it a bit slow. What I wanted was a tough workout (it is called ""power yoga"" after-all!), and don't think this dvd fits the bill.However, if I skip the first 5 minutes of each section of the workout, it is quite good. He seems to take a little bit to warm up to it."
2,Not Rodney's Best,"I was pretty excited when I purchased this DVD, and too think that I have 5 workouts in one. Sorry to say this is not his best tape:( The workout is not ultimate at all, and not typical for Rodney. I will stick with his older tapes such as Power Yoga Totoal Body."
2,Ok for beginner,I Love Rodney but this DVD is too easy. Its beautiful and graceful. His voice is terrific. I spent more time looking at the lovely back ground. If you are advanced or want to go deeper this is not for you. It is peaceful and if that's what you are going for then its perfect for you.
3,Okay,Not the power yoga I was hoping for. Still enjoyable but a bit slow for me. Good for relaxation though.
4,Beginner Yoga,"I loved Rodney Yee's Yoga Burn, and I thought this would be a more vigorous workout. Pretty surprised at how basic it is. However, I can make it as easy or as challenging as I want depending on how much I extend myself and I recommend it for anyone looking to start a yoga routine!"
5,Fantastic!,"Wonderful DVD. Rodney Yee's instructions are clear and directive and his voice is calming. This DVD makes a amazingly relaxing, refreshing and revitalizing workout. As someone who has only had some experience with yoga before, this DVD is the perfect level of difficulty."
3,Ultimate Power Yoga- Rodny Yee,"I really thought this would be his best DVD but I was very disappointed. I expected it to be alot harder than it is. I am not a beginner and this would be perfect for someone just starting with yoga, It goes too slowly."
4,pretty nice,"The drums are excellent, and the music for the most part is lively. The vocals are a tad on the unusual side. The Indian influence gives a neat accent to the sound. For the most part, I enjoyed the music, but as good as it is, it isn't the best. However, I wouldn't say that it isn't worth getting."
2,"The Business of the ""mountain men""","Well researched, but very different from what I was expecting. This book focuses on the business aspect of 18 men who made their living trapping. This book glosses over any of the adventure, craft and technique and goes into specifics of the business transactions between the leaders and teams of the expeditions and the financieers. Kit Carson, Jim Bridger, Manuel Lisa, and other well known names are examined in these sketches of the mountain man's struggles for the elusive profits of the trapping business. I think if you're looking for an adventure book, pass this one by, but if you are a business major looking for some historical perspectives on the trapping and exploration ventures of the early and mid 1800s, then you might like this sometimes dry but factual account of the Mountain Men."
5,The best Comedy,"I just can't say enough about this movie. I laugh non stop everytime I watch it. The Stars in here are non ending and I just wish they still made movies like this. I just can't believe this is not on dvd, what a waste!!!!!!"
5,Hold on to your stomach!,"I highly recommend this video! You'll laugh so hard you will cry. It is definately one that should be a family favorite, that is if its not already. I am so glad to finally find it available, have been looking for it for years to add to my vast video collection."
5,You'll laugh so hard you'll pee your pants!!!,I watched this movie on beta max when it first came out and recently saw it again. It is just as funny as the first time I viewed it. Check out the servent's mascot Montclair! This movie is a RIOT!
4,A GREAT MOVIE,I saw this movie when i was a kid and have been dying to see this movie again. I got two movies because my mom has been looking for it to. This movie is fun and has an all star cast. It was great when i was a kid and great when my kids were kids.
5,PLEASE release this movie on DVD,This has to be one of the funniest movies ever made. It has a allstar cast and is very family friendly with no curse words. I am truly puzzeled that this movie never made it to DVD. Will all the garbage movies that made it to DVD and this didn't is mind boggling! So PLEASE RELEASE IT ON DVD!!!
4,Steel Structures,I bought this book because it was required for my class. I was given a few problems out of the book to do as homework but used the book for nothing more. According to my professor who knows the author had said this book contained a decent amount of errors. Since I am by no means knowledgeable with steel structures you can either believe that or not. If the book is correct the examples given go through the process step by step and I found it very helpful. There may be another book that is better than this but a required book is a required book.
3,Good book,"When I used this book it was easy to find what I was looking for, like formulas and examples. I will keep it for further referance."
3,There are a lot of mistakes,"I have already read the book and study many of the examples, my classmates and I have found many mistakes in the fourth edition, however the information contained and the subjects studied are very complete. I hope the next edition will have those examples solved in a correct way in order to clasify this book as an excellent text."
5,Still the Best General Steel Structural Design Book Available,"Given the available books on the market for general steel structural design in the U.S., this is by far the best. The breadth of topics covered is abundant without any sacrifice in depth of full backround and commentary, which is sorely missing from other books of this kind. The layout and presentation of information is very clear and readable.Although a new edition covering changes in the industry since the last publication would be greatly appreciated, the book taken for when it was published is still very applicable for use now (despite reviews to the contrary given below). Any competent engineer can adjust to changes in industry standards as the base material given in the book is very solid and sound.The proof in the outstanding quality of this book is trying to use other similar books in the market today, which generally fall short in comparison."
4,steel structures: design and behavior (4th edition),"Great book! Lots of theory and examples to support subject matter. Unfortunately, sometimes the theory and layout of the book becomes overwhelming. THE reference for P.E. exam."
2,Getting worse each edition!,CHECK EVERY PROBLEM - I just worked through the composite beam chapter 16 and the errors are prolific!?!#$# So bad that you begin to question yourself! I have the earlier editions from the 1970's which are great and I have used them continuously over the years as reference. Obviosly the new edition is LRFD and not ASD but I am extremely disappointed in the number of errors.
5,A History Mystery!,"This book is a winner for anyone who has ever walked, biked, or driven across the Brooklyn Bridge and marveled at its grandeur.The author interweaves a page-turning mystery story with gripping details of the actual construction of that glorious bridge. He is obviously knowledgeable enough about the bridge to have written the story of its design and construction alone, but the added excitement of his suspense-filled mystery makes this a great read. I loved it."
2,"interesting plot, but not well written","Sorry, I thought this was a very interesting topic, but poor writing in need of editing doesn't excuse the hurdle of making good historical fiction. The plot was well conceived, but the writing, my god, the writing was sometimes atrocious."
4,hard to believe this is a first novel,"""Suspension"" is an intelligent, elegantly written historical thriller with interesting, fully realized characters (yes, even the madam-with-a-heart-of-gold seems fresh on these pages). The New York setting is wonderfully portrayed. Although the middle seemed to sag a bit under the weight of police department politics, I had trouble putting the book down once I reached the last half. Highly recommended!"
4,If you like historicals...,"If your looking for another ""Alienist"" this is not it! ""Suspension"" is very deep in historical detail but more adventurous than ""The Alienist"". It's more along the lines of Maan Myer's (if you are not familiar with Maan Myers then, first, slap your hand with your other, and secondly, go and do an out-of-print search for any of the Dutchman historical series) books than Caleb Carr's in that the prose is very ""popular fiction"" in its telling although you get some great dialect dialogue!This is a good find that I hope gets some great press!NOW GO FIND MAAN MEYER'S BOOKS!"
2,Jade by Roger Keverne,"I study Jade Culture of the Orient and I use this reference for the good bibliography, and illustrations. It is an attempt by the now defunct 'Friends of Jade Society' to compile a comprehensive reference on jade and ancient and historical jade cultures from all over the world. For most of the world it is reasonably accurate, but unfortunately the Chinese section concerning jade has more errors than a freshman essay. This is even more embarrasing since most of the book is devoted to Chinese jade culture. A more detailed list and discussion of these errors and problems is available upon request."
5,as descibed and on time,"The ring arrived on time and was the one shown in the picture. Inexpensive, nice-looking, and my girlfriend likes it!"
4,perfect,"i got this for my mom because her favorite animal's are elephants she loved it, it was the first ring she got since her wedding ring 17 years ago! the ring came before the time limit it was really small though but luckily my mom fingers are small so it all worked out! =) It was in perfect shape and very pretty i think it's a wonderful item for anyone."
5,Love it!!!!,I receive my jewelry so fast. The size is true and fit perfectly. I really love the design. I recommend this product to anyone who like Elephant like me.
4,Very worthy knives,These knifes are quite nice for the price. They are extremely sharp and feel nicely balanced in the hand. I really like the one piece modern design for ease of cleaning. The bamboo block has a small foot print so it saves counter space and is a nice change from the traditional square hardwood blocks.
3,eyepieces could not adjust small enough,"While the binoculars were fine for me, my partner could not use them because the distance between eyepieces could not adjust small enough to match the distance between her eyes due to the third lens."
3,Meade Capture View by semi-pro photographer. FK Walter,"Received Binoculars/Camera as a Christmas gift. The Binoculars seem to work fine. However; the digital camera leaves a lot to be desired. Do not expect to get a Sharpe picture on distant objects!! I have taken at least 60 different shots and the only fair ones are from 50 to 200 feet. I am using the Nikon Colpix 5000(5Mega Pixils)!! The difference is like night and day!! Do not expect the Meade camera to even come close to the quality of our Nikon 5000! We Plan to use the Binocular portion mainly on hiking trips and to take an occasional picture at about 200 feet out. This would be OK for someone new to digital photography and wants a entry level camera. A nice toy, but not a quality camera!!"
1,Flawed design,"I recieved this item as a gift, but soon returned it. The camera part of the binoculars is too close to the eye pieces. I was not able to get the eye pieces close enough to my eyes because the camera was so close. (I have a rather ordinary nose.) I had to raise the binoculars higher on my nose bridge and this obstructed my view, not allowing me to properly focus the lenses in order to capture pictures. Don't waste your money on this item."
2,msc/std,"This product looks cheap, the material quality is not good. It was made in China, however, Meade did not control the production quality as expect. That's why the finished product is sub-quality, especially the battery compartment cover is difficult to open and can not close it perfectly. Although the price is attractive, but this binocular view is sub-standard and the picture quality from its digital camera function is unexpected."
1,Not sure I like it yet,"I opened the box and installed (or tried to install) the software for this piece of equipment, and found that the software loaded ok, the driver installed properly, but the Tutorial WOULD NOT RUN. I am VERY disappointed in the documentation (instructions for the software and technical info for the camera/binocs)! As another reviewer stated, the thing shuts off after 10 seconds of non-use - a pain in the neck when you are out 'birding' and trying to catch the perfect shot - and that is NOT DOCUMENTED anywhere!I will keep trying with this...I have a trip coming up and plan to take my REAL camera, too. I am sure the technology on these things will get better. I hope to contact Meade and let them know how disappointed I am."
5,A good camera,This camera is excellent for birdwatching & catching those great shots. The perfect picture is about 16 feet from you- I have taken some prize winning photos with mine.It is fixed focus and takes some time to learn to perfect your technique- but by and all I am pleased with the price and the product. My boyfriend also bought one and we enjoy taking pictures together and comparing.A good product- a good price.
1,Worst camera in the world.,"I hate this camera. The pictures always come out blurry, and you can't even tell what the picture looks like. I think that it is a piece of junk. If you keep the batteries in then it will erase the pictures and if you take the batteries out then it will erase the pictures also...if it were up to me I would never buy it. If you want your pictures to turn out well, you have to have the room really, really bright, and it has to be so focused that the camera can't even focus that much...so in other words your pictures won't turn out!! The only thing good about this camera is that the binoculars work!!"
3,"Knew going in that these would be cheap, but...","The reviews for the CaptureView have been less than great, but knowing this I still purchased these for my wife as she was insistent on getting something to watch our kid(s) in the distance on sport days.Yet to test them in all situations, but so I am not moved either way as to their quality or the pictures produced .. 'tis what it tis"
4,Nice product,"Good, fun option for events. Not the best quality pictures but like an instamatic captures a moment. Thanks for the time."
1,Nice try but ...,"This is a really clever combination, and a really noble attempt at a product, but seriously, anyone who uses binoculars for more than a peep at some popstar's midrift is a person interested in seeing what they are looking at, and 640x480 resolution is, frankly, not enough resolution for anything more than webpage icons (don't forget that most photos end up being cropped). Having the name Meade attached is a draw, but I expect this is one more item in their new line of made-in-China products (the telescope is ok, but scrap the tripod!). Maybe ok for a toy for your 10-year-old, but if it costs more than [$$$], you're better off with a JamCam."
1,What a rip,"My kid got this for me last week.It's a toy.When my wife told me how much it cost I flipped.I told my kid I loved it ,didn't want to make her feel bad.Good company,this one stinks"
1,The Meade Capture View just doesn't work,"I bought the capture view very recently. I can't get my computer to recognize the camera. I have an extremely high speed/high end new Dell computer. I use my Dell all the time to download and edit photos from my digital cameras with no problems at all. I'm also pretty computer literate. The Meade Capture View would not work out of the box. I went online, but no info there helped my situation. I attempted multiple fixes, including driver updates, reinstallations, and every combination you can imagine. I have called Meade over and over, but get no answer! The Capture View requires more effort than its worth. I imagine I purchased an inoperative camera or have a bad cable. However, I can't solve the issue because I can't get through to Meade."
1,Meade capture view scopecam The worst,"This camera crashed my computer 4 times and the one time I did get it to work the pictures were blurred,unfocused and dark. I even got on their website to download a new driver compatible with wiindows xp and it still crashed my computer. I almost lost all my files and my system has not been the same since I may have to get a repair person in to reset everything! I would NOT recomend this camera."
2,"Fun as a toy, but not for serious photographs","Considering that 8x22 binoculars cost $20-$30 you are paying $70 for a digital camera. That's about what you get. A good deal of light is required and the 640x480 is not enough resolution for serious pictures. Unlike other USB cameras, the software provided must be used to download pictures. The PhotoExpress software that ships with the binocularss is very good. For $100 the technology just isn't quite there yet."
2,It's just OK,"I got one for Christmas (my friend saw the ads on Discovery Channel). The binoculars actually do work well (I was skeptical) and picture quality does leave something to be desired, but again I was skeptical, so I wasn't surprised. A little tweaking in my photo editor, and everything was fine.The battery drain problem is very annoying - and for this one reason alone I may still opt to return it and save my $$ for something better."
4,Last Tiger Out,"Good book, but the story line is lacking and missing a lot of information. I bought this book because it is about my wife's uncle. I have herd the story from various family members and they all say the same things about Dan. This book leaves out some very critical details and some of the story line is not real. My opinion is that they only focused on the religious side of the story which was a bigt part of his live but not in his early years."
5,None,"This harness fit my 6 pound Yorkie perfectly. I'm glad I got the x-small, because it does run a little big, and she would have drowned in the small."
4,Adorable,The outfit/harness is very cute but a tad large for a small. The velcro closure is somewhat wide and stiff. I will have to make adjustments to it before she is able to use it.
2,Looks great but product design could be improved.,"I am OK with the neck strap connected by Velcro assuming a dog that fits the correct size will not be able to bust it open even if it pulls or tugs. But I don't like the missing bottom piece that connect the neck piece to the stomach straps. Without this bottom support, the stomach straps will create a lot of pressure on the dog's stomach should you and your dog want to do a tug-a-war for deciding who's the boss in deciding which direction to go. This would have been a 4-5 star product if they think of dog comfort over production cost."
1,This book is so bad it's funny,"The unparalleled wretchedness of this book makes it a riotous read. For years this book has had a cult following among music fans who love to ridicule the type of anti-music preaching that fills this tome. The horrendous spelling and punctuation makes the book look like a semiliterate Internet post, and the factual misstatements don't exactly help matters. What's more, most of the photos of album sleeves look like they're made by someone sneaking a camera into a record store and photographing albums on the shelf.Seriously, if you're interested in a good, scholarly book on music, this ain't it."
3,GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE ETHNIC NEIGHBORHOODS IN MANHATTAN,"My copy of this video had a poor sound track. View Video needs to work on their quality control. That said, the video was a unique look at the Big Apple. While the major sights were shown- the emphasis was on some of the lesser-known sights. Like other videos in this series, the approach was educational and artsy, though somewhat less so than the European siblings of this series. It was a good look at the various cultural neighborhoods in Manhattan. For a rounded overview of NYC, also check out the conventional NYC videos available in most public libraries."
5,"AWESOME, MUST BUY DVD!","Ok, this is the story of a girl joins a circus and does a bunch of acrobatic stunts. Sounds boring right? Well it's not. I've watched many anime series lately with more interesting premises, and none of them were anywhere near as good as kaleido star. The makers of this show have somehow found a way to turn an ordinary premise into a beautiful, interesting, exciting adventure that starts out great and only gets better with every episode. KS is funny, cute, and and fully enjoyable. I strongly recommend this DVD set for anyone who loves to smile and laugh.My only warning is that the box and DVD cases in this particular set are a bit flimsy, and the extras are lacking. If you really want those things then buy the individual DVD's. If you just want the show at a great price, then get this set as it's an excellent deal."
3,Not that Impressive,"This lipstick was ok but it was not what I was expecting, it is more pink and not as sheer as I thought it would be. It may be the lip gloss/stick for you, but it wasn't for me."
4,Love my earrings,I have been waiting for diamond earrings for years so I decided to buy them for myself for christmas. They arrived quickly and are beautiful. Not to mention affordable.
3,Good soap,"This soap has a nice fragrance, but I haven't seen the slimming qualities that it boasts about. It is my understanding that it's suppose to work within two weeks of using it. All I have noticed is that your skin seems to ""tighten up"" when you later up, so that may be the soap ""working"" according to plan. I will keep using until all bars (3) are gone and then see if there is truly a difference."
2,hate the smell,I hate the smell and can't stand it. Need to hold my breath everytime I use it. Didn't see its slimmimg properties.
2,for Oiler fans only,"This book disappointed me, because I was hoping for something more vividly and eloquently written. I gather Mr. Carroll is not a professional writer, and for me it showed.Still, it's commendable that this period of the AFL's history has been captured for posterity."
5,Fascinating Book on the Popes,"I love books that are very complete and you can't get much more complete than this book. It has details on all the Roman Catholic popes up to and including John Paul II. Coulombe even lists the so-called anti-popes and includes the dates of each popes time in service. I learned many interesting facts and history. The book I would imagine be more interesting to Catholics on the whole, but anyone interested in the history of Christianity might also find this an interesting and informative read. We learn some of the bad things as well as some of the good things many of the popes did through-out two thousand years. It's quite a feat to put such an amazing book like this together."
2,the usual not practical book,"The book describes object orientation. Oh, come on, folks, there are tons of books on that topic and they do it better.The contents are very object orientation centered. In my experience as a tester, I don't care about the use language, paradigm or what ever (except for reviews of course). To me it seems that OO was new to the authors and they thought it would demand many new testing strategies, which it doesn't (after the JUnit testing of course).The proposed procedures look very much like something used at a university, but are not practical in the real world.I am a tester and test manager and I certainly did not found any help in here."
1,This is about as Irish as french fries,"Sure, the cover of this CD looks appealing, and the IMPORT label gives it the appearance of authenticity. However, when I first popped this CD into my player, I was more disappointed than a soccer hooligan at last call. This CD would be more accurately called ""Irish Party Muzak"". The hokey electric organ music sounds like the Hilton Music Store at the Mall. Whoever the ""various artists"" are that faked Irish accents on this recording should be forever banned from all Irish pubs for these sins against Irish culture.Let's see how I can put this most diplomatically.....DON""T BUY THIS CD....Save your [money] and go get yourself some Clancy Brothers, or Hair of the Dog if you want something fun AND Irish."
1,Worse than airline food,"Describing this as airline food would be an insult to airline food. Mushy, flavorless. You would be much better to make your own, or find an adult ravioli with flavor and kid-friendly ingredients. Now, I am reluctant to try any of the Gerber Graduates."
4,Another pilot's thoughts.,"Running into the Sky was both very informative about the technical and practical aspects of learning to fly Powered Paragliders as well as being a very entertaining saga. The author has a great sense of humor which is mixed in good proportion with valuable information.Anyone who flys or dreams of flying a ram air wing, powered or non, should give this a read."
5,A good reading from paramotor pilots,"I really enjoyed this book. I have been flying for about a year and this book was like a journal of my own experiences. Very nice for pilots, prospective pilots and people in general interested in to understand better the feelings and reasons why people fly."
4,Very good product and good price.,Album holds 24 5x7's (2 per side of page). Easy to load and 5x7's stay in place. Good for small photo projects.
2,Wrong tube directions,"I agree with the other reviewer. The tubes ARE what is shown in the photo. The tubes on the fuel filter for my car point the exact opposite directions, crossing over the filter. I bent the fuel lines on this one so that the fuel lines in the car didn't get kinked. If you have a subaru, you probably need a different brand."
5,"Great Music, Great Performances","In every way, this is an inspired performance of Sea Drift, Delius' great masterpiece. Bryn Terfel is exceptional, vocally and interpretively. The orchestra and chorus are equal partners with Terfel in piercing to the heart and soul of this powerful and emotional testament of bereavement. Have a box of Kleenex nearby. The Songs of Farewell and Songs of Sunset ably complete the disc. Sally Burgess, mezzo soprano, is a joy to hear and goes well with Terfel's robust baritone in the Songs of Sunset."
4,Does what it says!,"Allows variable hole drilling. Made a nice job of drilling a clean hole in my skis (for attaching cord for crevasse rescue). Given this was drilling through a mixture of ptex, aluminium and plastic I was impressed by how neat the hole was."
3,Height requirements restrictive,"I have a 40 pound 3 year old that will not reliably keep his shoulder behind the seatbelt in a booster. I am on a quest for a car seat that can keep a child in the harness past 40 pounds.This is one of the options, but it did not work for us. My son is tall for his age (about 42 inches) and normally proportioned, and his shoulders are already too tall for the 5 point harness. I think it would have to be a short stocky child that could use this harness much past 40 pounds!We have bought the Britax Regent for my SUV, and it works well but is HUGE! I am sure it wouldn't fit in most cars. For smaller cars, try the Sunshine Kids Radian. Its harness can be used up to 65 pounds also, but accommodates taller children than the Apex, and is smaller than the Regent or other Britax models."
3,Be careful,"I wonder how long the torso was for the previous reviewer's ""tall boy,"" because the top slots on the Apex are fairly low for a 65 lb limit seat. If your child is leggy or short it may be fine.Also my daughter (almost 4 yo) thought this seat was uncomfortable. So make sure you try before you buy! (I found it at a BabiesRUs)Most importantly, you must have high headrests if you want to use this seat! The builtin head rests on it are not adequate to protect your child, as it relies on the strength of your seatback. So be careful that it fits your car properly.Otherwise, it's nice to be able to harness past 40 lbs, and the price is right, so I gave it 3 stars."
2,Short on the why and the how of golf exercise,"I exercise regulary, and have bought just about every golf fitness book. I found this one short on the theory part, like what does weight training do for golf? Also, pictures were hard to follow, some showed the end position of the exercise, some the middle or start. The title and back cover promised a 1/4 pounder and I got the kiddie veggie burger."
5,Good quality russian Bible,"This is one the best (I mean quality of material) Bibles in Russian I had to hold in my hand. Leather covering isn't thin; it does really protect a Bible. Text of course is on smallish size, but it is very contrasty and legible, paper is thin but not overly so-it's just perfect. Translation is what is considered to be the best- synodiecal, no nonsense new translation, read the Bible as it was read in former Soviet Union or Russia starting from 1876. Also, it seems that in Russia they finally learned how to make quality product."
1,Not the classic Thomas anymore.,"My sixteen month old son loves Thomas & Friends. This new ""improved"" version is fully computer generated. As soon as he saw their mouths moving he FREAKED OUT and cried until I turned the DVD off. I don't recommend buying these newer DVD's for smaller children. It may be cool for older kids but it's frightening for youngsters who are used to the classic Thomas series. It's a shame they had to ruin it."
2,So So Thomas,Sure I should have know that this Thomas DVD would have an American narration but gone are the opening titles with each episode and so too is the song at the end. The new animated faces are good but it's a so so release for me
4,CGI Thomas,"We love the new annimated Thomas series! It gives the characters a more natural feel! All the trains, conductors and even Sir Topom Hat all talk! Much more entertaing! My one year old just loves this too! Old and New fans will love the change. Highly Recommend."
4,Nice bag for a quick trip,"Nothing fancy, but it's a good size for a weekend trip. Seems to be made pretty well and is holding up so far."
2,Made In China,This buffer was smaller then I expected.But most disapointing of all was the fact that it is not made in Tiawan but China. And it shows. It obviously is mass produced on a grand scale with very thick sheet metal that is stamped and not forged. The Base is OK. The switch is junk.Your buffing wheels will have to be perfectly balanced or the buffer will wobble like crazy. I tried bolting it down to my bench to no avail.If you get too much rubbing compound on one side of the wheel it will wobble and vibrate like crazy.I have many Grizzly products that are good quality including a 16 inch band saw and a 1x9 belt sander. These products were made in Tiawan not China.I sent this item back and got charge a restocking fee of 15%.The shipping is NOT free and quickly brings this item up over $100.00
2,Motor failed after 8 months,"I used this buffer primarily for sharpening/honing edge tools, and did a little buffing of steel and copper. It worked well for eight months (estimated usage one to two hours per week), and then the bearings in the motor started growling like crazy and the motor quit altogether. I see in Grizzly's online catalog that Grizzly has discontinued this item. This is a good decision on Grizzly's part; this buffer isn't up to the standard of other Grizzly tools I've used."
5,Psycho,This book shows how quiet people can seem harmless but very dangerous...How a man has so much love for his mother he does the unthinkable...
4,Good Read,The legends behind Ed Gein were common in my childhood. This book told all of the legends and how they came to be while actually giving the truth of his life.
4,It was a good read,"I purchased this book because I wanted to know the Ed Gein story. And that is what I got; I found the book to be very informative. It of course covered the murders committed by Mr. Gein, but also gave a lot of information about his life including his mental and emotional status."
3,Scary,I saw this documentary and wanted to read the book. A bizarre man. I am glad he didn't live next door to me.
3,"Good book, plenty of details, minimal analysis","This is the story of the guy who inspired Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Silence of the Lambs. Like Dahmer, a little pitiful man named Ed Gein, raised by a dominant mother and abusive father, drifted into insanity after the death of his mother and proceeds to murder two women, rob the graves of several others and uses their body for multiple goulish ends.Easy read, well written, but overly simple, this book does not delve significantly in depth into the mind of Gein but just explains the facts regarding the facts that overwheled Plainfield, WI in 1957. I read it in two sittings and feel confident I know enough of what happened. Pretty good book, but not really worthy of my library for the long term, as Capote's ""In Cold Blood"" which was outstanding."
3,A classic case watered down,"I am an avid true crime reader, and one of the things that I find most disturbing in the genre is the frequent necessity to write books even when there is little to say. Ed Gein's case is rightly considered a landmark in crime history, yet the facts of his story are quite scant. Schechter, because the story is so old, could obviously not find any new fact in the case. As a result, the book is ""watered down"" - it could have been easily cut to become a magazine article. Having said that, Schechter is a master teller and his style and rhythm are always first-class."
3,Cover bent in half,"The pages of this book were in great condition, but the cover was bent completely in half. As someone who likes to keep her books in perfect condition, I was quite disappointed by the crease down the centre of the front cover."
2,Disappointed,"I was very diappointed in this book. I was expecting to read and to learn more about Ed Gein, than the town, cops, judges, and etc.... If you don't want a lot of information then this book will be good, if you wanted to learn more about Gein, get a diffrent book."
3,A study of a cultural monster,"Ed Gein was a sick man and his behavior fascinated us because he was obsessed with the dead. ""Deviant"" is correct! His story is creepy but we have to remember that he was so far over the edge of sanity that he isn't to be equated with some truly evil people in our world such as Bundy, Gacy or Manson. A decent account that reaches a bit too far."
5,"""Deviant"" true crime book of the year!","If amazon would let you use more than 5 stars, this book would be right up there with all the old classics. The story of Ed Gein is told so well in Harold Schechters book, that you begin to think that it is a work of fiction. The plot is mindblowingly accurate, Harold (as always) has done his homwork. Reading Eddies background story of a hard life, burdened by an over domineering mother, actually makes you pity the guy. Though this book in no way excuses his crimes, it gives you an insight to the small town of Plainfeild, witch during the 50s, was a breeding ground for Eddies madness. The book is obviously of adult content but is so good that prehaps some older teenages should read it. My read of the year definetly. Thank you Harold Schechter."
4,Gruesome but good,"This book is very easy to read, very well written and does keep one going til the end. It's not too horrible but factual and gory enough to be very interesting. Really morbidly fascinating reading."
5,interesting book,I like to read books like this for some strange reason and this was a good one. I will be buying more like it in the future. It satisfied my need for what people's twisted minds are capable of doing. Scarey to know they are in our world.
4,"Well Written, Not Sensationalistic.","This is a well-written, factual chronology of the Plainview killer, and what I liked best about this book is the author's effort to put the murders in context -- a 50s era of suburban complacency was actually a fear-ridden, deeply anxious time when fissures emerging in American society post-WWII started to erupt and, in some cases, crack.Gein was an unlikely killer, a simpleton with a mother complex but also someone who hid his crimes in plain sight. His ability to function more or less normally in the American heartland at the same time he was committing horrific crimes occupies a significant portion of this book, and the examination of how he succeeded and how he ultimately got caught is riveting and well-done."
3,"Great fiddling, but fails as an instructional piece","Aly Bain is an astonishingly good fiddler. He plays with a beautiful tone, his notes are clean and crisp, his ornamentation is lightning fast and tastefully done. Which makes it all that much more frustrating that absolutely no effort at all has been put into explaining any of the bowing or fingering techniques he uses. Just the barebone notes are given, and no chords either. Definitely worth having though if you enjoy fiddle, for the sheer listening enjoyment.If you're looking for a good instructional series, I recommend Kevin Burke's in the Homespun series. There's a six-disc audio version and a two-DVD set. I've got both and they're both worth having. Kevin's also an excellent fiddler, and he breaks down the tunes and shows all the nuances and subtlties to Irish-style playing."
3,Not the perfect fiddle book I hoped for.,"I admire Aly Bain as a fiddler very much and hoped this book would show me how he plays all these famous traditional tunes. However, altough a CD in included, the book does not show me how exactly he plays the tunes. There is no information in the music scores which notes are put together and how the bow is being used. My violin-teacher has a hard time analysing what exactly Aly is doing on the CD tracks. A little more information on what extra notes and variations he plays would be welcome.Nevertheless, I'm happy with the book, but without my teacher I would not know what to do with it."
4,Kicked my cold to the curb,"My kids came down with a nasty summer cold, and then I started feeling ill, too. Nope, mom can't afford to get sick. I picked up a bottle of these lozenges and some extra vitamin C, and in two days I felt a lot better. By the third day I was back in the fight. I recommend these zinc lozenges highly."
2,A true story?????,"Just a few words. This is a self published book, and if glaring errors like the pilot owning a laptop in 1992 don't bother you, well go ahead and read it. Makes me immediately critical and skeptical about any work , fiction, or non fiction (this purports to be based on a true story)that so blantantly is unedited."
5,I love Signing Time!!!,"As always this is a great product. My only complaint is that they are too short!!! The shows are 30 mins ea so when driving it makes it hard to switch DVDs constantly. My son isn't hearing impaired, but he signs like a pro. I like it because while he's learning to speak, i can understand a sign and help him pronounce the words better. It's made learning a snap! He's 2 and can count 1-10 and knows all the ABCs by sight and sign!!!"
4,Very good scanner....so far,"I have scanned over 300 slides to this point with only 2 jams and have hundreds (if not thousands) to go! My slides are from the 1960s to present and vary in condition. The 2 jams I've had were not, in my opinion, the machine's fault as the cardboard was beginning to separate on these slides. I found it difficult to remove the jam.I paid for a 3-year service contract on this unit, but have not received any information or paperwork since purchasing it 4 months ago. Amazon provides an e-mail to contact the service contract staff, which I have just done today. Hoping to get an explanation soon.Happy scanning!"
5,Great 2.1 speaker set-up enough to rock out on with a good sound card,"Great 2.1 Labtec Pulse 475 Speaker System, would recommend to all with a decent sound card, currently with Sound Blaster X-Fi Xtreme Audio, current Vista x64 OS drivers"
4,Talk about pretty ...,"""You are my love"", despite being totally unable to find the lyrics for the song, is the prettiest song I have ever heard (over 50 years of music appreciation, and no silly name dropping)."
4,Gerald on my mind (recommended),"Albright blows his toes off with the bluesy GEORGIA ON MY MIND that sounds like no prior rendition. If you can afford to purchase just one selection, let it be this. It DEFINITELY would be a rousing conclusion to his performance April 19th at the 16th annual Guitars & Saxes concert (edit: and it was)!The title cut, NEW BEGINNINGS, is sassy and smooth, as are other selections such as DEEP INTO MY SOUL and I NEED YOU. Some songs (like the latter) include background choruses; my preference is pure instrumental. All cuts have the full-bodied saxophone style that is unmistakably Gerald; several rhythms are reminiscent of earlier Albright recordings. The compilation is guaranteed to improve a tense ride to work and help you unwind a smile after an exhausting day."
4,Getting Better & Better,"I have already reviewed a couple of Gerald's previous projects with the overriding sentiment being that Gerald fares much better as a premiere session man rather than the centerpiece. Yet since I made that observation about 3 years ago, his solo projects have been consistently solid. Before, I could not imagine sitting through an entire Gerald Albright set simply because he tended to pale in comparison to the David Koz's, George Howards, Dee Browns, or even Kim Waters for that matter.But lately, Gerald has produced some quality projects, showcasing inventine sax work in some sparkling arrangements. This project is no exception and is actually the best work he has submitted in a while.Gerald shines with his spot-on choral sax arrangements and his band is top-notch. If you are a smooth jazz sax man/woman, this project will not disappoint.Nice, inventive work!!!!"
4,Nice case but a few problems,"This is a very attractive case with cool blue lights on the front and convenient USB, firewire and audio jacks on the front panel. There is plenty of room to work inside. I am not impressed with the mounting system for the hard drives however. They mount on rubber gromments on slide in trays. In practice this is a noisy mounting method since the trays are not well secured and vibrate. Otherwise this is a very quiet case. The USB and firewiere cables have exactly the same connector on the end and are not labelled as to which is which. Plugging them into the wrong connector on the motherboard can cause damage. The power on LED cable is a 2 pin connector and my motherboard requires a 3 pin connector. The temperature display is worthless since there is no way to mount the sensors anywhere that would be useful. This is a very nice case, but for the rather high price you would think Antec could have taken better care of the small details."
1,Case wiring is Junk,There is no doubt that this Antec P160 case is very well engineered. But the plugs for the front USB and 1394 (firewire) are not identified. Calling and writing e-mail to tech support does nothing - they dont reply. Its buyer figure this out on your own or do without. Even their FAQ area doesnt explain things. They use wire colors that are not present in the case. I talked to a computer builder in an effort to get help (which they couldnt give) and they said that they will not order this case again.
3,Trinity Blood is a lot better.,"Chrono Crusade isn't bad, but it's not great either. It has a lot in common with the newer Trinity Blood. Rosette and Chrono are. members of a religious organization that kills the demons plaguing America. There is a lot of action in this series and a bit of comic relief. The animation and voice acting in this series are both good. It's just doesn't have that something that makes an anime great. I like the ending. It was a good, and brought a few tears to my eyes. I think the series would have been better if it had built more on the relationship between the demon, Chrono, and the nun, Rosette. There are some people out there that really like this series, so you might wanna try it out. If so I would recommend renting it or watching it on youtube b4 you buy."
3,just another average anime,"Chrono Crusade has too many episodes that don't contribute much towards the storyline. The premise of the series, although intriguing, is bogged down by weak character performances. Watch this series if you have some time on the weekend and nothing good to do."
3,Just Okay,"There are much better anime out there. I had a hard time staying awake through a good portion of Chrono Crusade, where as others i would stay up for days playing the next episode."
2,the manga is better,"if you want to see a good story about good vs evil with magic, demons, and comedy get try Devil May Cry, Inuyasha, ect. this story was gutted from the original manga and isnt worth watching to the end as it well disapoint you if you want to know the real story read the manga"
2,Spoiler!!!!!!,"OKey, so I absolutley hated the ending!! I mean everybody dies!! and yes I couldn't stop crying. But what about happy endings?"
1,drek,demonic cartoons for turning baked out teenage minds to mush like satanic smurfs on acid.... too bad realy cuz if it wasnt so annoying and idiotic they have have some good ideas for something that could have been ALOT better!
5,Amazing,"This is probably my favorite anime series, and I have seen quite a few. The animation is brilliant and the characters are endearing. On the surface, this series tells the story of a battle between God and the devil, and on God's side there's a demon, an exorcist and an apostle. The character development is wonderful and by the end of the series you feel like you know the characters like the back of your hand. I cannot praise this series enough and I hardly suggest you check it out. :)"
3,"Quality hat, but runs small","I ordered this hat for my husband. I was so excited to get it! And he tried it on, and it looked like it was made for a child. The sizing appears to be off. The hat was well made and looked really nice, except for the size being way off."
2,For the same price you can get a 22 oz jar!,For the exact same price on amazon you can get a 22 oz yankee candle. I did not know there were separate sizes so went with the cheaper product (by 0.50 cents) only to get half the candle hence half the burn time. Look for the 22 oz candles! I love my candle but do not love the small size.
1,Just doesn't work!,"If you puchase this item, hope that the model pictured here is better than the slightly different looking similar product I have from Rust-Oleum. The one I have is too flimsy to hold a can of spray paint. Pressing on the trigger causes the can to fall right out of the holder. Only way to get it to work is to hold the can with one hand and the spray grip with the other, which greatly reduces usefulness. Even shaking the can causes the grip to fall off. A worthless trinket; don't waste your money."
1,Can fell off and hit the item I was spraying!!,"I am really beginning to wonder about Rust-Oleum products and their quality. I've had problems with their spray paint but they did offer a refund. Now I bought this Spray Handle expecting to not have any problems as it was a Rust-Oleum product. Well after a couple uses, it no longer gripped as tightly and a can of Rust-Oleum spray paint fell off the handle and onto the item I was spraying. Now I have to fix it by sanding it. I would have expected that this Rust-Oleum spray can handle should work perfectly on a Rust-Oleum can of spray paint, it didn't. Really disappointed with Rust-Oleum."
3,Re: This goods item,"Well, it's not bad, considering that what I got was not the same as this one in the pic etc. I got a different one to the one specified OK"
5,The most gorgeous garden book available!,"This stunning tribute to the gardens of Provence is truly a masterpiece. The author and photographer have captured the most breathtaking collection of photographs of crafted nature to behold. The care and artistry that is unveiled is the essence of the beautiful plants that are seen in this unique and exquisite area of the world. The wonderful herbs that are evocative of Provence are left wild or cultured into enchanting or simple shapes that enrich the senses. The heady perfumes of Rosemary, thyme, lavender, and all the other local favorites almost reach the olfactory glands through the seductive rendering of this landscape. This book is sensual browsing; put your rosemary, lavender and thyme nearby. Create your own aromatherapy. Better yet, go there!"
3,different from hardcover edition,I was disappointed when I gave this book as a gift to find that it is not exactly the same as the hardcover edition. Some photos are missing that were in the hardcover edition so if you enjoyed that book don't think that this one will replace it. I don't know if the text is different.
1,Not Very Helpful,"Having a child suffering from encopresis, I was not helped at all by this book. The information seemed outdated."
3,"Constipation, Withholding and Your Child: A Family guide to Soiling and Wetting",I bought this book for info on withholding. There is a lot of info in the book but not much on that particular subject. The short story of Mr. Poo at the beginning was most helpful. Too bad it wasn't in a small illustrated story for kids.
3,"OK, not much I didn't know",We had a specific situation not outlined in this book. Not much info I wasn't able to find elsewhere. Good book if you're just starting to deal with this issue.
2,Dossn't deliver,"Apparently, I have a divergent point of view from the other folks. Being a Tony Hillerman junkie, I was, of course, thrilled to see this author being compared with Hillerman on the back of the book. I was disappointed in the quality of the writing, however. Where to start? The dialog seemed pretty stilted to me. People I know don't talk like this. The relationship between the cop and the newswoman seemed to drift into a higher level of intimacy, seemingly without any development. I always wonder when authors have characters calling each other ""Dear"" or ""Darling"" practically right after they've met. And what was he doing, taking a woman he'd just met on a dangerous homicide investigation?The loop to visit Chester (or Buster, take your pick) seemed to stand by itself with very a tenuous connection to the story. I could go on, but won't. I also won't read any more of these, and I'm sorry, because I really need a Hillerman fix. I'll have to wait for Tony's next for that."
2,Just okay,"Because I'm a Tony Hillerman fan, I looked forward to reading this mystery. Unfortunately, I had trouble finishing the book.There were several good scenes (for example, the Ute woman's visions, the murder of the graduate student, and the police chief's interviews with the suspects). But before my interest in the story could deepen, the next scene would shift to a different character's point of view. Also, it was hard to keep track of who was who. Some characters were offstage for hundreds of pages and then they reappeared.For those reasons, I won't read another book by this author."
4,A Compelling Series,"Wonderful justoposition of Indian metaphysics (what we in the Western world call ""occult,"" but only because we haven't scientific instruments to measure) and the white world. Nice character development with Pariss, the Chicago cop come to the Southwest who has learned to act on his emotional nudges, the elderly Daisy who interacts with The Dwarf, Charlie Moon with a foot in both the Anglo culture and grudging awareness of the other world of his Ute upbringing, Anne the investigative reporter, and Pariss and Charlie's growing friendship. A wonderful continuing series. Read in chronological order -- though each book is complete within itself, characters are introduced and grow.But read only if you are willing to suspend disbelief about the mental-spiritual world.Nice to have on your bookshelf with Tony Hillerman and Peter Bowen."
1,Harmonica,I love the harmonica and I thought this would be good. But I didnt like it at all. I love Paul Delay-- live he was totally great.
5,It's Now Where You Start It's Where You Finish,"Very uplifting, good book. Great for anyone to read. Easy read. The principles shared in this book can be applied to anyone's life."
4,Great Surprise!,Candance Cameron was great in this movie she really made you feel for the character and the difficulty she was going through. You kind of cheered and was fearful for her through the whole movie. Worth Watching!!
2,Not as good as I remember...,"I watched this movie on tv as a teenager and remembered loving it so I bought it. I must've had bad taste as a teen! Although it wasn't the worst movie I'd ever seen, it was pretty bad. You'd think Candace Cameron would be able to act a little better after all those years on Full House. I found myself getting embarrassed for her!"
3,Not what I expected,I purchased this product to use to help with my high school students but I immediately sent it back when I looked inside to see it was not what I expected. The book is geared towards parents of small children. Not for the teacher or parent of children with older children with attitudes.
1,Not so great,"This book talks more about describing the bad attitudes instead of simple, easy techniques to stop them. Not easy to use, not easy to read."
2,Hummmmmmmmmmmmmmm...,"I picked these speakers up because the price was right and they sounded great in the store. But I get them home to my quiet house and lo and behold the subwoofer constantly hums. I'm not an audiophile and therefore not overly particular about sound... other than this annoying hum from the subwoofer. Since these are set up in my home office where I spend a lot of time reading, I find this humming far too distracting. Although the price is good, I'd prefer to pay a little more just to omit the subwoofer's constant hum.I'm returning these speakers today and will shop around for another set."
5,Excellent Speakers,"I went into Best Buy to look at expensive receivers to replace my old broken down one, and decided to take a look at some computer speakers as I listen to all my music and watch all my movies through my PC. It took me all of 30 seconds to decide to buy these speakers instead. I couldn't believe the sound that was I was hearing. The Bose speakers positioned right next to them (that were the same price) didn't sound nearly as good. Both low and high sounds come off crystal clear. These speakers, combined with a Sound Blaster Audigy provide an incredible sound experience rivaling high end audio systems costing hundreds more. In other words, I would recommend these speakers."
1,WARNING - SUBWOOFER HUM,"I have a MSEE (Master's in Electrical Eng) - this sound system is flawed from the ground up - there is a substantial 60 Hz hum that will not go away no matter what volume level or wiring configuration you use. The company has the nerve to print in its op manual that such hum is ""normal"" - and therefore will not do anything to remedy it - I returned mine to Amazon within a week - I hope they have the decency not to charge me for shipping back such a defective unit. I just received a Creative Inspire 3000, which is head and shoulders better than anything I've heard from Altec Lansing. and it's $25 cheaper."
4,Altec Lansing VS4121 2.1 Speaker System,"I've had this system now for about a month and love it. Everything came as expected with no hang-ups. The systems is awesome. Lots of bass almost too much. I find that I have to kick up the treble and lower the bass so it doesn't overpower the sound. But really this system really rocks. It puts out alot more power than I expected. The sound quality is good. This is the first system like this I've purchase and I use it mostly with my MP3 player. It will rock the living room while having friends over. I am really pleased with the performance, size and value."
2,low frequences too much,I bought this set a long time ago and I am not happy with it.Way too much bass!! even when I put bass low and treble almost max the sound is way to low in frequences.another problem is if you shutdown the bass there is a noise background.a cheap set but not great. I'll not advise you to buy it.
5,Best Computer Speakers I've Ever Heard,"Bought these almost a year ago. Bass can be overwhelming but is fully adjustable. The sound is comparable to my audio equipment and I find myself playing a cd on the computer instead of going out of the office to play on the ""big"" system. If you can find these, buy them. You will be amazed."
2,No Mid range response at all,"I'm no audiophile, but I expected more from Altec Lansing. My biggest compaint is that there is no midrange. None. I'm really not that picky, but it's just not there at all. There's the loud sub that does tend towards boomy and there's the tinny sats. Piano, guitar, vocals; anything that require midrange response is left out. No amout of tweaking with the bass and treble will fix this mix.If you intend to listen to music at all through these speakers then I'd say look elsewhere. You can do better for less money that this system."
3,Just Okay speakers,"Reviews for these speakers are remarkably mixed as you'll see. Unfortunately, I must agree with the naysayers. For the price, these speakers are quite mediocre. In fact, at low volume, my Toshiba laptop's (Satellite P105) built in Harman/Kardon speakers sound noticeably better than these. I know, hard to believe, but true. The speakers do look nice. The right speaker has volume, treble and bass control as well as an on/off switch. I find the Bass to be extremely loud, even when the dial is turned to a very low setting. The subwoofer is quite large, larger than it looks in the picture. This may account for some of the reason that these speakers don't produce a sound quality as high as I would expect. One reviewer mentions a humming sound but I have yet to hear it. It's hard to find good speakers for a good price. If sound quality is very important to you, I recommend looking elsewhere."
1,Nice Sound-But Product Failure,In exactly 12.5 months (just out of warranty)the system began to fail. I use it with an IBM Thinkpad and I have an earlier Altec Lansing ACS 340 which continues to work fine. I called Altec's tech support 1-800-258-3288 and was told that even though the system was out of warranty they would fix it. All I had to do was wait for a call from their tech people to check it out. Call never came. Called back and was told to connect the system to an MP3 player. Did that. System wouldn't work on either of two think pads or an IPOD. The ACS 340 however would work. Two months later I am still getting the run around. Maybe my situation is an exception--but I won't buy another Altec Lansing speaker system.
2,Problem with repair,"I read through some of the reviews - the speakers do emit a hum. However, I was ok with it. But one day I tripped over wire plugged into the back of the woofer and the cable plug broke off in the receptor. I tried to scrap it out but could not. I found to my dismay that the woofer is built in such a way that it cannot be repaired. I brought it back to Best Buy to see if they could scrap out the remains of the cable plug in the receptor but they could not. The back of the woofer says that the unit can not be serviced. It should not be too hard to build a woofer so that it is relatively modular. I gave it a star since it is decent for its price, but I can't use it now."
1,Don't Buy,"These are the worst speakers I have ever bought. The high's are flat, the sub is muddy. To top it off the first pair I bought had a loose connection. They sent me a replacment, but that one every once in ahwile will create a buzz. Waste of my time and my money."
2,"Good treble, lacking midrange, booming bass and loud hum","The treble sounds quite nice, but the midrange is far too weak and the bass is much too loud. This can be fixed quite well with a 32 band software equalizer and the measurements made at [...]. But then there's the dreaded low hum mentioned by several other reviewers and I've found no solution for that. I'm sure there are better choices at this price range."
4,good buy.,"I am very happy with these speakers. Some people complain about a low subwoofer hum (ground noise), but I have yet to experience this. The sub is VERY potent and I like it. The only complaint I have is the downfiring midrange which seems to dampen the mids at low volume.These are a great buy for someone looking for speakers that are low in price but not quality."
4,recently dusted this set off and it is still nice...,"This Altec system replaced an older Altec which I used for a year, then it failed.It was a shame as it was a great sounding set of speakers. These did suffer from""mid-drop"" but it can be mitigated with EQ. Also, I'm using the set in my bathroom to have a system to listen to whiledressing, bathing, etc. I placed the satellites high on a porous wicker shelf and the mids are there, now!Not bad for a six-year old set is what I say. You can get better but I didn't pay too much years agoand since they aren't this years model they would go for nothing used. They are pretty, too!."
4,"Quite good, for music and as TV speakers...","2-29-2012aQuite good, for music and as TV speakers...A friend of mine was moving, and did not needed these any more. Price, I pay for these - Lunch. Nice!Anyway, I have a Sony 32 Inch LCD/ LED TV, (KDL-32EX520) and the speakers are not as good as I'd expect (rear/ down facing, light on the base, even after tweaking the EQ/ Tone).I was planning to get the same speakers, I have for my computer, that I like. The Logitech S220. Lucky for me, these became available beforehand instead.The VS4121 sound very good. Much better that the S220. But, I have to agree, with other reviewers, the down facing mid range speakers, somewhat limits the mid tones. This is why I gave them 4-stars.These work very well for my TV speakers and when I plugged in my Fuze, and played a MP3, it sound good. Maybe, too much base, maybe?Not tested, on the computer. I may swap these for the computer's S220, or not..."
5,help please,i was wonduring if the color of these speakers are the same as in the picture because these are at my local staples store and they sre black and silver instead of the off white ones in the picture because i don't want the off white ones. at staples they are $99.99 but here at amazon they are $69.99 so if the real color is black and silver i want to get it here so please i would appreciate the help. and the speakers do sound really good and the bass is nice.
2,stale,"i love the design, but like other reviewers have stated... there is hardly ANY mid range coming out of these things.. way too much low end (i have my eq lows scooped out and the bass dial on the speaker all the way to the bottom and there is still too much bass coming from the sub) the lack of mids result in just a stale, dry sound that eq'ing just dosnt help.. im probably going to get a new pair of speakers.."
1,Terrible hum - awful awful awful,"My first response was wow! Very bassy. Then I got sick of it and dialed it down to 1/4. Why are they still so boomy? And where is the mid range? Then I found the mid range speakers on the bottom of the sattelite speakers!! No wonder they sound so bad. I thought 'oh well, they sound ok for youtube etc' and then lo and behold I could hear a hum under and between all the videos! I turned off the PC, still a hum. Disconnected all plugs - still a hum! Unplugged all other electronics in the room - STILL A HUM! DOH! Did some research online - these are a BROKEN PRODUCT - DO NOT PURCHASE. The buzz will drive you NUTS!!!"
1,Horrible Hummmmmm,"returned mine after less than 24 hours because of the incredibly annoying and loud hum that comes out of the subwoofer just because it's plugged into the wall (the owner's manual says this is normal because the alternating current in your home is set at 60). a friend of mine (who's an electrical engineering major) told me that almost everybody's electricity in their home is 60, so there is nothing you can do to fix the problem... what a shame, because they sounded great while playing songs, but when not in use, the noise was unbearable."
4,Great for Added Counter Space,"This kitchen cart added more counter space, a drawer for utensils, and a cabinet for some pots and pans, but isn't bulky or difficult to move around. Assembly is definitely a 2-person job though."
1,"Terrible product, poorly engineered","This is a put it together yourself item, and it is one of the most poorly designed kits I have ever seen. Parts don't fit together, screws were not included. I literally had to pull out a hacksaw to make things fit. And it still wouldn't line up well.A terrible product. Don't buy it."
3,P.O.S.,"Cart recieved damaged - was left on my porch in a box that fell apart. Someone noted the damages on the side of the box, but delivered it anyway.Did not get help from vendor, manufacturer or shipping company.Parts were cracked and there was no assembly instructions in the package - again recieved no help from vendor or manufacturer. There are no instructions online either."
2,"Great Design, Poor Implementation","I ordered this cart directly from Cymax. It arrived quickly. Opening the box we found the shelves broken. There were also no instructions. I called the 1-800 customer service several times staying on hold 15+ minutes each time. I gave up that approach in frustration and sent an e-mail. My e-mail was answered in two days. Subsequent e-mail exchanges took 2-4 days for Cymax to respond. After 3 weeks I decided to repair the broken pieces myself and assemble the cart. It takes two people to assemble. Once assembled it looks great and is a wonderful addition to the kitchen. I did receive replacement shelves shipped from Thailand. It took over a month to receive them.The bottom line. Like others have reported, my cart arrived without assembly instructions and with damaged parts. The telephone customer service does not answer in a reasonable time. The e-mail customer service is slow but effective. The cart looks good, is solid, and functional."
2,It's ok,"Despite what other reviewers have said, this is not the most quality wood out there. It tends to break easily, especially certain pieces. It's not exactly the easiest piece of furniture to put together either. It's ok, but a little overpriced for the quality.Update: Winsome contacted me and I feel that the issue has been fully resolved. I feel that they did the right thing. Based on this I would recommend Winsome in the future, just make sure it's being shipped directly from them."
5,Love this island,"Terrific quality, surprised how sturdy it is for the price. Just a bit of a pain to put together, some parts need to be forced just a tad. Just move slow and follow the directions. Definitely much better than we anticipated."
3,Assembling Drop-Leaf Kitchen Cart without instructions,"The drop leaf table is OK for the price. The packaging appeared to be OK, but there were 4 places where the wood was dented or chipped in handling. I can only guess that the damage was done before it was packaged.There were no assembly instructions. It took me 3 hours to assemble due to putting parts together in the wrong sequence, requiring partial disassembly and re-assembly. With the availability of the internet, there is no excuse for not having the assembly procedures on-line for the case of missing instructions. Winsome needs to join the Technology Age for product support.Other than the damage (which I repaired as best I could) and the assembly problems (due to lack of instructions), it is a good solid kitchen cart.I would not recommend this product to a friend unless they were really good at assembling and repairing furniture."
3,No instructions!,"I gave this cart as a mother's day gift and the size is great, quality is there and looks good. However, it loses a star because the box had absolutely no instructions in the box on how to build it or even an inventory of pieces. Considering that it wasn't a first time building furniture, it wasn't THAT hard to figure it out, but any type of instruction or part description would've been helpful. I should also add the the magnets on the front for the doors were already glued and not even. Although not a big deal for my mother, it bugs me that the front doors aren't exactly perfectly aligned. But for the price, I'll take it."
2,Some pieces arrived damaged,The cart itself is quite sturdy but there were several dings in the wood and a crack in the bottom piece of the drawer
3,Winsome Kitchen Cart,Unfortunately I needed this immediately or I would have sent it back. Over half of the pieces were not labeled. Many pieces had chips and gouges in them. Seems like for the amount of money it costs it should have been better quality.
2,Support?,The speakers worked great for maybe 2 weeks. Now they let out an annoying hum noise when turned on. Regardless of whether they're plugged into the computer or not.I can't seem to find their website or get any kind of support whatsoever.Be warned!
3,its complicated,"Its too large , heavy , I rather buy few extra battery . With today technology I expected better , not easy use , you got to be kind of techi to figure things out,"
1,Adapter Fails to Work,"This was a very promising product. I was able to use my HP adapter to power it up. But, try as I could, when I connected it to my HP Pavillion laptop, it refused to power the laptop. I was on my way to travel on the road for 3 weeks and needed it. Instead, I opted for a car-based AC-Adapter. I would check the company to make sure your exact model is supported."
1,"A beautiful, heartfelt book","This is a definite must have for Britney fans, and may even win over some people who don't like her! It's a quick read, and quite inspiring. Britney is such a great role model for everyone everywhere. This book is an intimate glimpse into this talented young woman's life. Buy it! You'll love it!"
4,Made me closer to my mum,This book told me about how she and her mum coped really well. She became a stronger person and achieved success because she respected her mum. I think this made my mum and I think about each other more.
4,The real story of Britney,"A year ago, I thought Britney Spears was just another boring singer, hidden by make-up.Now, I know how wrong i was. This book looks closely behind the life of this superstar. From the early days of living in Kentwood, her family in debt & hardly a cent between them, 2 recording her huge no. 1 hits. This book is a great hit for fans or non fans of the teen sensation!"
1,I just wish that she could sing...,"The book is boring, and by buying it you are feeding the all time Hollywood mashine.... and make more profit for Britney ( does she need more money, than what she has? and still not happy? my suggestion she she should try an ordinary 8am-5pm job. Don`t waste your money. It is time for her to grow up."
4,Britney Baby,I think this book is great. I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because i really don't feel any book is prefect even though Britney is perfect. I really admire Britney for all the hard work she has done the past couple years. The videos are wonderful and show the true her.
1,"Do not touch this terrible piece of ""literature""","How can Britney even think of writing? I mean, after reading the first paragraph she wrote she should've stopped there. I believe it's a horrible, fluff filled, pointless, meaningless story about Britney. It just shows how full of herself it is. I'm very sorry i ever read it, but now I can have an opinion I am able to back up about the ""singer"". I suggest none of you even consider purchasing this terrible book"
1,Nothing Like Trying To Make Your Life Sound Perfect,"It is expected for an artist to write a book which does nothing but say how good they are. However, it gets a little ridiculous when a singer attempts to write a book saying her family is perfect and that her and her mom ""would go to the moon and back for each other"". Everyone knows that what is being said is simply what Britney and her mom think the public want to hear. What I would have liked to here is the truth about her life."
5,"Look out, James Joyce!","Excellent. Sublime. Ethereal. These are the only words that can hope to do justice to this brilliant, wonderful book. I have not read such accomplished writing since the ""Nausicca"" episode in Joyce's ULYSSES. HEART TO HEART snares the nebulous all-encompassing phenomena that we call (for lack of a better word) ""Being"" better than anything in Samuel Beckett's TRILOGY. To the list of the century's great thinkers (Wittgenstein, Lacan, Heidegger), one is compelled to add Spears."
3,2 all Britney fanz and motherz and daughterz,"Not only is this a good item 4 Britney fanz, but also 4 motherz and daughterz. It tells otherwise untold tales about Britney, and what goes on in her life. It also shares advice for parents and teens about family realtionships."
2,"Very pretty,but...","I bought this set for my baby that i am waiting for in April.I washed in once and all sintepon collapsed.((Very pretty set,but horrible quality..."
4,Before going for Wheelock's,Salve! Try this book first before starting with the more official Wheelock's book. Even if you don't learn Latin you get to learn a lot of interesting facts about the Roman life and the origin of different words.
1,Bad Purchase - Beware,What an awful intro to Latin. Error-filled hodgepodge slapped together by three pretenders. Readers will spend a long time unlearning errata in this flimflam.
1,Latin By Dummies,"Latin isn't for dummies.If you're a dummy,skip Latin and do yourmediocre best to learn yourprimary language.For those who want to learn Latin,get one of the Latin for smartiesbooks.I know this isn't a verysubstantial review,but I had to get it out of mysystem.The title alone ought to prohibityou from desiring the book."
3,"I qualify, I am a dummy.",I is a good book for someone who has some understanding of Latin. It does not have a very large translation section.
1,Look elsewhere to learn Latin,"The For Dummies series has been riding on its laurels a bit too long. Back in the days of MS-DOS and Windows 3.1, the Dummies series was innovative and really good. I guess the marketers decided to branch out and attempt to apply the same model to hundreds of other fields. The Dummies schtick is nothing but a comedy overlay to an existing academic model that is confusing to start with.Latin For Dummies fails because they take the same ponderous academic teaching model and spin it with silly and trite text. They don't even try to get away from the grammarian's non-intuitive inside language of dative, declension, genitive, infinitive, conjugation, etc. Words that also must be mastered in order to slog through the same tired obfuscated academic approach to Latin that made our grandparents hate Latin when they were kids.The For Dummies series fails in the same way with Calculus but, that's for another review!"
1,This watch is a bummer,"The watch looked ok,though the links were pretty chunky for a woman's watch. The band was very loose and slpped annoyingly up and down my arm. Has a clasp which can be a little tricky. Instructions for removing links are unclear ans seem to be for a different model.Finally , the watch soon stopeed keeping accurate time. It may just need a new battery, but the watch was so annoying I haven't replaced it. Cheap, but no bargain."
5,The only guide for budget travelling!,"I just returned from travelling through Turkey with a Turkish friend who lives in Germany, and despite his familiarity with the country and cities, we both heavily relied upon the LP guide for information on lodging, historical sites, off-the-beaten-track towns, and other fun and interesting places to visit. It is a fabulous book, and the only one worth paying for to use for such a trip. All other travellers I encountered (who weren't on pre-planned tours or paying $200/night at the Hilton) were using the LP guide, whether from North America, Australia, or Europe. Great information, very comprehensive, aimed at budget travellers! Enjoy!"
4,An American Life,"George Appo lived a fascinating and revealing life - one that touched on Chinese immigration and the California Gold Rush (his father), Irish immigration (his mother), criminal activity in New York's notorious Five Points neighborhood, the very beginning of the opium culture in the U.S., political corruption and reform, the Broadway stage, as well as major upheavals in how America thought about medicine, psychiatry, and prisons. In ""A Pickpocket's Tale,"" Timothy J. Gilfoyle uses lengthy exceprts from Appo's previously unpublished autobiography as a narrative structure and launching point for his own interesting and informative excursions into all of these topics. The result is a thoroughly enjoyable, and educational, portrait of a pivotal time in America's country."
3,19th Century Lawless New York,A look at the late 19th century New York that seems more like the lawless Wild West than I would have expected with many problems including: illiteracy; poor sanitation; crooked police and politicians; dismal prisons; and opium addiction.
2,Disappointing music,"To me this CD is a waste of 52 minutes, consisting of weird and unappealing junk that never seems to go anywhere. Not much of a journey. You won't find much melody here."
2,Rautavaara Symphony # 8,"Appreciation of music is subjective. I think I bought this piece mistakenly; my fault. I must have misheard the name of the music on the radio, because the music I got was certainly not the same."
5,Changed my ways,"This book is an absolute must for anyone who might need to rely on a firearm to protect them. It has completely changed the way i operate my hand gun for defensive purposes, changed the way i clear my house when somethiing goes bump in the night and changed my mind set while carrying concealed. Great for anyone just learning to shoot or especially for someone who thinks they're a pro but hasn't had any formal training. And if you have children in your house dont forget to buy ""Gun proof your children"" by the same author."
5,Mas is as good as it gets!,"He's as good as it gets in today's time. Yep, read it over and over just like my other personal defense books. He is real and experiened, easy to understand, and uses his resources very well. Will keep buying and reading everything and anything he writes. Shipping was good."
4,"Stressfire, Vol. 1 (Gunfighting for Police: Advanced Tactics and Techniques) (Gunfighting for Police","This is the third book that I have read by this author.This book opens your eyes to the real world and shows you options for different scenarios.It isn't written in stone to do things his way, it tells you what is there and you choose what works best for you. Well worth the cost."
2,Did not enjoy - too verbose,"I had a really hard time reading this book - did not like it at all. I felt that the author was too verbose, trying to impress the reader by using as many big words as he could find. I am a college graduate who majored in English and French, so it's not that I don't have a decent vocabulary; but I found his writing a little over the top.I hate to quit reading a book, so I tried to make it to the end to find out the whole story; but I couldn't do it. I ended up trying to speed read through parts just to get to the end - not the way to read a book.The story line sounded interesting, but the book left me flat. Don't waste your time."
4,I read the first six,"Another adventure for the vicar. I enjoy the character, Merrily Watkins, and her daughter Jane. The diocesan exorcist has yet to do a personal exorcism, but uncovers a great deal of very human crime and very inexplicable happenings every time."
1,Disappointed in the TINY book (also for older children),"Though it is probably mentioned in the product description, I was totally unaware that the Nutcracker Activity Book is extremely small: just approximately 4"" x 6"" in size. With only 49 pages of activities, it doesn't seem like this activity book would last long enough for the car ride to the ballet. There are, however, some handy solutions for many of the puzzle-type activities in the back of the book. The coloring pages are too small for most children to enjoy. Also, most of the activities seem to be more appropriate for older children who can read and write. I was hoping to find some activities to do with my preschooler before we attend her first Nutcracker this year, but this wasn't the book to serve that purpose!"
4,Fun Activity Book for Children,This fun activity book is small and can keep a child occupied. Perfect stocking stuffer.
1,Dimmer control,"This just didn't work. It's supposed to be a dimmer switch but when I tried to dim the lights, it only put out a horrible humm and the lights went out completely.I sent an email to the company and got no response."
3,Low quality but cute,"I purchased these shoes for work and really enjoyed them - while they lasted. They are a great color, fit comfortably, but unfortunately the heal got down to the metal within 4 months of wearing the shoes weekly."
5,Great Quotes Form Great Women,Excellent resource. I collect quotes and there are a lot to save in this book.
5,Howard Shelley rules,"Howard Shelley has sadly never received the publicity he deserves for his incredible playing. He just always seems to get the piece he plays ""just right"". This CD is no exception. His playing is on fire, and the orchestra backs him with strength and with perfect timing.Awesome."
3,Dissapointing,"Only 8 episodes not in order as the Tv broadcasted,the last one compressed and fast paced.Only the die cast collectible makes the set worth.I hope Lions Gate learn the lesson and the last release of the series can be better.I'll be waiting."
1,Die Cast no longer included,"Amazon is no longer including the die-cast Mach 5, which if you read the other reviews is a selling point of this package."
4,Suspense and Love - The Perfect Combination,"I was in the market for a book full of suspense, intricate sub plots, a little romance, and well-developed characters. This book delivered on all but one--well-developed characters. I could visualize and ""feel"" the actions of many of the supporting characters such as Danny, Moses, and Chemin. Moses, the twin brother, was downright scary. However, the main character, Marshall, seemed bland and boring. He was not described in sufficient depth for me to feel anguish during his challenges, joy for his triumphs, or sadness during his downfalls.On the positive side, the well written story and all of the supporting characters made up for a lacking main character. The relationship between Marshall and his wife, Chemin, added just the right amount of romance to balance the story.The book also portrays African Americans as as professional, mature adults.If you like John Grisham and James Patterson, you will love Hardwick!"
5,Excellent page turner!,"Hardwick is an exceptional writer. His vivid prose, skill at telling a suspenseful and well-developed story and sharp and insightful understanding of the law made for a fantastic read. I couldn't put it down! My only question is, why are his books no longer in print??"
4,A Great read!!!,I had a hard time putting it down! From start to finish this book was great! Hardwick does a great job of keeping the readers interest!
5,Great Cork Screw.,"This is the best foil cutter I have used, and I have tried a lot of them. The cork screw works with the ease of my Raabbit, with out the bulkiness. Great buy."
3,"An ""Exhausting"" Study","I read this book after finishing Martin Gilbert's excellent recent book ""Churchill & America"", but have been largely disappointed. I find it to be a plodding and overly detailed account of the Holocaust that tells the same facts over and over again through the experiences of different people. While this is probably a theme of the Holocaust--horrible things done to many innocent people over and over again--I am not sure that verisimilitude helps keep the reader engaged."
4,A good summary of Hitler's war against the Jews,"This is definitely a must read for any student of the Holocaust. Gilbert, however, fails to focus on the numerous other victims, such as Poles and Soviet POWs. In other words, he does not attempt to analyze the Holocaust from every angle. In order to understand the evolution of the Holocaust, one must be aware of the euthanasia program under Hitler and other oppressive measures against criminals, communists, asocials, and other ""undesirables"" which were practiced under the Third Reich long before the extermination of the Jews began."
5,Ridiculous prices,These books are for sale for ridiculous prices. You can get them from the author for about 1/3 the price. Some people must think we're morons.
5,Beautiful,"Went to a Native American Festival and listen to Arvel Bird play. It was unreal, the sound of his fidle is magnificent. We got several CD, Animal Totems 1 and 2, recommend both. So relaxing."
4,genetic manipulated society,"This is one of the most really SF-like Star Trek books in the series. I say this because in this books, next to the normal first contact episodes, the ever present klingon warriors, the torpedo's, the bantering between the 3 leading characters, in this book two interesting alien societies are sketched. Esspecially the strongly individualistic culture of geneticly manipulated humans, that have adopted themselfs to their tasks, their waterful environnement and their own wishes is fascinating."
2,High expectations were not met with this book,"This book was a disappointing entry for a Star Trek book. It was long on political dialogue and short on action. The plot was thinly thrown together, with not much connecting each scene to the next. The cover of this book is great - a water world! But all the scenarios you think could be used for such a story were left out."
3,Libertarian propaganda with a thesaurus,"The basic plot and action sequences are actually quite good, but the annoying libertarian (corporate anarchy) theme and the inability of the author to put down the thesaurus and just use words that do not require a look up every other page leaves this a three star ST TOS adventureAnother reviewer commented on the humor in this novel. I would comment on that as well, if I could find any humor at all."
4,Atypical Stravinsky,"Nice CD that offers an introduction to some Stravinsky works besides ""Firebird"" and ""The Rite of Spring.""Many listeners may be surprised to hear how relatively traditional the Symphony #1 is, especially when contrasted with the Violin Concerto. In some ways, it's hard to believe that both works are the creations of the same composer.The Symphony is more to my personal taste; I think it exhibits energy, humor, and is more listenable than the concerto."
4,good for its price,"have not used it much yet, but appears to be stable and holds my heavy underwater housing and video camera"
3,Good but not great.,"I like this tripod, but after having it for a couple of months, the mounting plate is loose and there is no place to tighten it. I find that I'm using the remote more often in order to take pictures so the camera won't shake."
2,"Adequate, not great even for a cheap tripod","The elevation control (the tilting controlled by the large twist handle, not the thing which raises or lowers the center column) is a little shaky - when you tighten the control to lock elevation in place it will always be off from where you aimed.Also, I wouldn't count on the levels for any serious work/projects. I've used this tripod for panoramas, but in order to get usable level shots I need to eyeball the center column and pan head for square a couple dozen times, adjust the legs accordingly.That's perfectly reasonable for a cheap (under $30) tripod.What's not reasonable is that after a dozen or so uses one of the leg latches broke and now I can't extend the middle section of the tripod. I expect better than that even for a toy tripod like this one."
3,"Good quality tripod, but leveling feature is difficult to use","This would be a great tripod for a digital camera where you simply mount the camera to shoot pictures and are not concerned about being perfectly level. It is not very good for mounting items like laser levels where you have to be perfectly level before you use it. The swivel feature is jerky, and when you try to turn it around 360 degrees it keeps jerking and the extremely sensitive bubble level keeps getting out of level. I haven't managed to get the tripod going out of level for the past hour even when I am standing on perfectly level ground, let alone on uneven soil. I finally used it for my digital camera instead and it works great for that purpose. I guess that is what it is meant for anyway - so as long as you aren't relying on the leveling feature, everything else works fine."
5,it`s good,"I bought it days ago, it is good, enough tall and stable, realy worth the price. the only weak point is that the pan is small, the buble can not be seen when we put the camera on it."
5,Very sturdy,"I am not an expert photographer or filmer. However, for what I use this tri pod for (making youtube videos) it works great. It is very sturdy and serves my purpose well. I use it both inside and outside when filming. It's lightweight, yet durable, tall, yet sturdy."
4,Works well with Evolt 500,"It works very well with the DSLR Olympus E500, and Ive loaded it upto 5lbs. However, you get what you pay for:- Its mostly plastic, requiring a delicate touch.- It does not have a ball head.For the price - its awesome!!"
2,Very heavy and the head is not leveled,"I am not a pro and wanted it for day to day shooting. However, this was not upto the quality that I expected. It is much heavier than I thought and more over the head is not leveled, so when ever I click pics using the tripod they are tilted to one direction.. which is annoying. I have to keep extra space just to ensure I will be able to correct the tilt later.Also, the swing movement is not smooth and has a jerky feeling. Please put some more money to buy a better, lighter product."
4,Gets The Job Done,"The only reason I am a lithe hard on this tripod is that I had a Canon one very similar in size and build and all the parts on the Canon one just seem smoother and sturdier. However, having said that, this tripod has thus far worked as it should. The huge plus about this is that if you lose the mount you can locate replacement ones. Canon was so difficult and so annoying that I refused to look any longer and just got this tripod, which comes with two mounts and is almost as much as any possible replacement mount solution for Canon.For sheer workability, it definitely works well, but the plastic pieces seem a little iffy and the clamps are so-so. However, none have broken or malfunctioned to stop use, but I worry that will be the downfall of the tripod. For the price, it is a great fix though and I wouldn't mind having to buy one every 1-3 years or until I can afford a really nice one."
4,"works great for the price paid... its not a professional tripod, but it does the job","i like, and it didn't cost more than what i was willing to spend... i liked it mostly for the release mounting plate and the liquid balance... the material isn't the best quality there is, but u get what u pay for... it is light, so that's a good thing if u want to carry it around a lot... i bought it mostly to take pictures of me and my baby if no one's around to take the pictures and just use the timer shots on camera with the tripod... oh and it came with an extra mounting plate which was awesome..."
4,Great Buy,Needed a new tripod and this did the trick. Not for everyday use but for the advid photographer it is handy. should have come with a bag.
4,Great for the price,"I went into the purchase knowing ""caveat emptor"" and ""you get what you pay for"". I've been extremely satisfied with this product.The locking tabs on the legs are sturdy and I don't fear them slipping. In fact, all of the securing tension mechanisms work very well.My only gripe is the camera quick-release isn't so quick. It takes some force to open and close the locking mechanism.It's not a lightweight tripod, but again... it's inexpensive.That all said, my only worries are:The handle and gears of the telescoping column are plastic and I worry about breaking it. Make SURE you're released the tension on the column before trying to lift or close it!Despite a heavy carrying weight, it is on the light side when planted (legs aren't far enough apart, IMO) and there is no hook to hang a weight on.For an introductory-mid level tripod, this is a bargain. I look forward to using it for 2-3 years at least."
5,Unbelievable Tripod,"The price could very well be 3X as much,look know furthur, the Sunpack 8001UT issuperior in quality compared with othertripod's out there, you wont be sorry!"
5,Excellent value and sturdy with all the adjustments,"This is not a top of the line tripod, but very darn functional and hefty/stable... You won't be dissappointed. Avery good deal indeed. Some cheap parts, that`s ongvious, but should last a long time."
4,Took a chance on a deep discount,"I was in a bit of a rush to buy a camera tripod to replace one that had become partially broken and I came across this one at a huge markdown (> 80% off suggested retail, presumably a discontinued model). I don't very often use a tripod, but wanted to start using one more for my daughter's track meets since I was getting tired of making shaky videos with my handheld camcorder. I'm sure a serious photographer/videographer wouldn't be impressed with this model for a variety of reasons, but I'm not that particular. The size is just right for me, it's easy enough to set up, and it collapses compactly. I suppose my biggest criticism would probably be that the panning mechanism could move more smoothly, but for what I paid, I really can't complain too much. Overall, it's been a solid bargain."
4,Best tri-pod I've owned.,"This is my fourth tripod. The ones I have had previous to this one have all felt cheap and weak. One collapsed with my $400 camcorder on top of it. This tripod looks and feels sturdy. The legs have some weight to them and don't feel like they will collapse under the weight of my equipment. Honestly, I was going to get the 6601, but with this one I got the super saver shipping (Thanks to the recommendation of one of the other reviewers), but I am completely satisfied with this product. I like the bubble levels. I used them this past weekend to take a family reunion portrait in my back yard. I plan on taking it to the beach this summer for another family portrait (on my wife's side)."
2,Easily Broken,I really like this product except that I have had to return it because the three arms that connect to the three legs from the center post were broken off from the legs. The one sent to me to replace my return had two of these same connections broken the second time around - geez! Don't want to deal with it anymore.
3,"fine for photo, not for video","This is a fine tripod for stationary photo work - good price, sturdy enough, nice level, attachment is good, quick release works well. However the pan and tilt are just not smooth enough for video."
5,Good solid product.,I got this for my Pentax DSLR and it works good for it. Sturdy and light weight.
1,Plastic head = bad.,Don't buy this tripod. I bought it and used it maybe 10 times and the thread for the vertical movement got very loose and now no longer tightens. It is now unusable because my camera will always point down when I place it on. The legs are sturdy and works fine but the plastic head is definately a no no. I guess buying an expensive tripod with a changable head then to waste your money over and over on cheap tripods.
2,defective tilt locking handle,"I bought this tripod three months ago and have been so pleased with it... until the tilt locking handle (which holds your camera steady at the top of the tripod) wouldn't tighten down enough anymore. Unfortunately, it's not much help to have a tripod that won't hold your camera steady! Hopefully this is a rare defect and you won't encounter it yourself. I've contacted Buy.com to see about returning it for a replacement or a refund... am hoping it'll all work out ok. I hope if you get this product, it'll work better for you!"
5,great tripod at a great price!,"I was looking for a tripod for my new T3i and this one fits the bill. It is very good quality and not high priced. This is ideal for me to use to learn my camera, use for auto shoot at family gatherings and for using the movie setting. This would work great for a video camera, smooth operating panning. The legs are easy to operate and the platform to quick mount/dismount is so great. This is a sturdy tripod.Some other reviewers mentioned concern about the tripod tipping or not working well on uneven ground...I just don't see the same concern. I am not using a heavier zoom lens though.Solid and great features make this a great buy. So happy I saw reviews on moving up to this tripod from another, less expensive version for free shipping too. Just wish this could travel easier in my carryon for an upcoming vacation! Thanks Amazon!"
1,Doesn't Remove Facial Hair,"I purchased this because of the good reviews it recieved from other buyers. However, when I used the product as directed it did not remove any hair. It did remove a layer of skin though. I won't say this product is bad. This product just didn't work for me."
1,SD2008 worst ever?,"I bought this SD2008 switch and I had trouble from the beginning.Connected PC with gigabit eithernet, Linkstation with gigabit port, and a couple of other laptops.Could not get all to connect to my router. Very weird.I got it only to work with only 2 devices, at 100MB, so I just let it be.Finally it stopped working all together after 16 months.As for linksys/cisco support, not a good experience.I would say stay away from these ""small business"" linksys switches."
1,Two of these failed,"I bought two of these Linksys gigbit switches for small networks in two different offices. Each one failed within four months of installation. Diagnosing the first failure, disguised as massive packet losses, caused a couple of days of frustration before the culprit confessed. I don't have time for this nonsense, so am now using a pair ofNETGEAR GS608 8-Port Gigabit Desktop Switchand all is well. They have yellow (slow) and greeen (fast) LEDs to show which port is running on which speed. Much smaller wall wart, too."
1,SD2008 Ver 2.1,"The one on my desk worked like a champ for about three months, then slowly began to experience degraded performance on multiple ports. We bought 8 of these dogs, and already 2 have gone completely Tango Uniform in less than a month.Don't know about V3, but I would definitely steer clear of 2.1, unless you have no particular attachment to your money."
3,like it so far.....,I would have not bought this switch after reading the reviews here and gone for the DLink however I had got this as a gift. I have v3 and so far it seems to be working well. It is well built with metal construction and seems to run cool. My only real negative point is that it does not indicate connection speed on the ports - I am at a loss to why they would not put that on the unit. There is no way to check on the unit itself and you have to go to the connected devices to check speed. I think if I was actually buying a switch I probably would not get this one.-----------------------------------------update 11/8/2010so happy to report that after about 1 year 2 of these units are still working well. The do still run warm but they are on 24/7 no downtime and I have not had a failure yet.
1,"Great for a while, now ports are failing","Was so excited when this switch came out, we bought one about 6 months ago and it was working great. But then, in recent weeks, we've noticed performance issues (for example, copying files between workstations and server suddenly was taking so much longer). After many hours of troubleshooting we found that one of the ports on the SD2008 v2.1 was the culprit. While the switch light indicated 1000mb connectivity, the switch was only getting speeds of 10mb on this particular port. We switched the port and it resolved the problem. However, we now are searching for another (more reliable) switch as the next port failure is probably on it's way."
5,Nice piece overall,"The switch does its job. It would be nice if there was an upgrade to move Version 1 models up to 2.1, I had one of these given to me for christmas and I bought one christmas morning. Both came from here at Amazon and I received one of each model. It also would have been nice for the switch to be bigger, it is the width of the eight jacks and that is about it. Overall the product performs well and will be in my rack for years to come."
1,Garbage-Died after 6 months,"This thing is junk. A real shame that Cisco came along and ruined a good SOHO company. Runs really really hot, I even used a fan blowing on it but it still died. It also constantly dropped and locked after about 2 mo. of service.I had 2 long runs across my house and I think it is simply not capable of handling anything but short cable runs. Maybe not even that."
2,"Weirdly Loud, and Died After Six Months","(Original Review): Geez, the unbelievable fan noise! It really is, as another reviewer put it, as loud as a 10-year-old PC. I'd actually put it as loud as a 20-year-old PC!(Two Weeks Later): Interestingly, the noise has subsided dramatically after several weeks of ownship. It's completely unobjectionable now. I don't know if the fan bearings have worn away some rough spots, or what, but it's quiet, and still very cool, temperature-wise.(About 10 Months Later): It died, mysteriously, after about six months. I replaced it with the Linksys SD2005 (five ports), which is way quieter, even compared to the post-two-weeks-quieter noise of this one, and which has been working great. [Still working great as of 2008]"
1,Incredibly noisy fan,"I bought one of these for home use to replace my old 10baseT hub. I plugged in the Linksys switch and, my god is it loud. It has two internal fans in its tiny case, spinning at high RPMs. It's as loud as a server or a ten year old PC.Despite its tiny size, this box is not suitable for home or any other quiet environment. A machine room, sure, on a desk or in your music studio? Absolutely not.I'm sending mine back and getting a fanless Netgear switch instead.--Pat / zippy@cs.brandeis.edu"
1,Get a D-Link instead,"This product was noisy and worked for a few days but then failed. I was able to return it no problem.I've replaced it with a D-Link DGS-2208 8-Port 10/100/1000 Desktop Switch and I have to say the difference is amazing. The D-Link doesn't have a fan, so it is completely silent. How can one company make a product that requires 2 fans and another company make the same thing that doesn't require any fans?Also according to other posts there are several ""versions"" of the same model product. You have no control over what version you get, and the fact that Cisco/Linksys has released at least 3 different versions of this same product means they are aware of the problems. Not the behavior of a quality company."
1,Died after 1 year,Product died after one year. Since it has a lifetime warranty I have requested an RMA return. We will see how the replacement does.
1,It had a fan?,"Looking at other reviews, I now have a hint as to why my SD2008 stopped working so well. My network performance had really dropped to low levels, and I finally tracked it down to this switch. It was working fine when I first got it, but recently I was getting less than 20kbps (slower than a dial-up modem) to some web sites, and others were so unresponsive as to be unbearable.I replaced it with a 3COM switch, and things are much, much better now.On the plus side, it wasn't noisy at all. But I'm guessing--based on other reviews--that it's because the fan failed and it had started to overheat. It was probably only a matter of time before it failed completely."
1,Bad Switch design!!!,"We purchased four SD2008 and two SD2005 units and have experienced packet loss in the range of 80%. The effective rate of the switch is about 20MBS; much lower than a standard 100MB switch and has the added bonus of clogging up the Gigabit network.Linksys, thank you very much for wasting our time (12+ engineering hours on this product). Simple testing of large file data transfer rates would have detected this issue before this green apple hit the market.Our units are now on RMA, hopefully the Rev. 1.1 design will solve the problem. Until then you may want to consider the Netgear GS608."
2,This line is JUNK!,"I just wanted to extend my utter frustration with the RV0041 router. This is the same as the SD2008, just less ports. I spent more than $250 for this router when I bought it, thinking it would be all I ever needed. Only a few months after owning it, the already LOUD internal fan started sounding like a jet engine. I contacted Linksys support and was sent a replacement through the RMA process. The unit I received worked for about a month or so now without a problem until now. It has started sounding like the other one. What piece of junk fans did they put in these things? I am getting rid of this and going with another brand. Now I am out $254, and I have to go spend money on a router."
2,Great begining at least.....,"BACK COVER: He needs an heir; she's carrying his baby...Tall, bronzed Frenchman Xavier Salgado-Lezille isn't a man a girl can say no to easily. Jane tries to play it cool, but she's inexperiences...and a virgin. Falling in love isn't part of the plan...neither is discovering she's pregnant once the affair is over.Xavier knows she's carrying his child, and he wants an heir. Jane is chosen as his bride!OK, where to start, well at the least the book started out very good. And the very ending was good. However, in between that is was just bad! Jane gives Xavier the cold shoulder through out most of the book, and its just tiring reading it. And of course she thinks he don't love her so readers get the joy of reading about 100 pages of back-and-forth bickering. I don't know if this is Abby Green's first book, but I hope none of the other ones are like this."
2,Poetic and insightful but mistitled,"When he likened homosexuals to thieves, I quickly referred to the copyright. So, it needs to be updated and, frankly, despite the year it was written, there's no excuse. So, moving on... It is an eloquent and amazingly readable philosophical narrative about the paths we take in our lives. I, personally, was looking for something that provided insight into the process of self-directed change- how it happens, even, how to make it happen. This book does not answer that question. In fact, he doesn't really discuss 'change' until the last 15 pages of the book. If you're looking for prose, you'll get it. If you're looking for real, practical tools, you'll be disappointed, but that was never his intent."
5,"Profound, practical","A small but insightful book for self-understanding and self-transformation. Contrary to most books that stress changing from the inside out, Wheelis reminds us that repeated behavior, healthy or destructive, effects and affects who we become. His memorable chapter on ""Grass"" (the kind you cut with a mower) is worth the price of the book."
2,I do not know where it is,Someone stole my book before I could even read it. Keep your books out of sight of other people until you are tired of it.
4,Timeless guide,"I wish Moody Press would update this calssic book for today's readers. Otherwise, this is one of the best guides for personal evangelism out there."
2,Disappointed,"Lessons of a great teacher are always interesting, but I've learned basic figure drawing with other good books (Loomis, Walt Reed...) that make you learn more with the same amount of pages and are less expensive. But if you can afford this luxury, you can still go for it..."
5,Superb Life Drawing Instruction,"Glenn Vilppu is a master at communicating the ""fundamental tools not only to aide us in drawing but in seeing."" I have taken several life drawing classes which were competently taught, but Mr. Vilppu's book greatly augmented the classes bucause he is highly adept a explaining the process so that I now have a much clearer grasp of both the ""what"" and the ""how to"".It seems to me that many art instructors are so visually oriented that they cannot clearly articulate what it is that they are doing. Mr. Vilppu uses both words and pictures to clearly communicate basic figure drawing tools. The book includes numerous examples supplemented with helpful explanations covering everything from gesture through basic procedure to anatomy , modeling and even atmospheric perspective. Accompanying video tapes are also available for each of the 12 chapters. I have viewed 4 of these tapes and they are even better than the book!"
4,Fantastic.,Right now I've got better things to do than learn all sorts of moves and codes. This is a fun game you can jump right into and have have fun with.
5,LORUS MEANS VALUE AND STYLE!,"This is the second year that I have bought Lorus watches as Christmas and birthday presents. Every time that I have given one as a gift, they have been held to rave reviews for their styling and wearability. I gave this watch to my sister, who has very expensive jewelry, and she wears it right along with her more costly baubles. The men's watches are just as nice. I've been very happy with my purchases."
2,You get what you pay for...again,"Bought this as a gift.Was a bit flimsy. Look at the picture though, i mean, I knew what i was in for.Not as stunning as the other reviewer let on. Not sure what expensive baubles are (and I refuse to google it) but I know the person i bought this watch for has never taken it out of the junk drawer after the first day."
1,Never got my stuff,"I never received my order, then after some time received a credit to my account for the merchandise less shipping. I corrected the address when I received the order confirmation, and still never received my order and to add salt to the wound, got charged a high amount for shipping!"
4,As Good as the Canon 550,"I have had a good experience with Canon -for me they outperforme similar Sonys and Nikons- I received this the S80 as a X-Mass present last Dec'05. The features of the Camera are good but mostly the same as the Canon Model 550 which is cheaper and that we also have. The only cons of the S80 is the size and weight, it's bigger and more expensive than the 550. The S80 is more techy but if you are not a pro like me, the 8 Mega Pixels are not worsted if you are not going to do major crops or large-prints. You could save some money by going with the Canon 550 which I also consider faster than the S80."
5,Another Really good Canon S Series Camera,"I was looking at replacing my S30 digital camera. S30 really worked well for me for many years, but it started to give me some problems. I was really debating between the SD 550 or SD 600 and the S80 canon models. I thought 8 Megapixels with S80 was good, but I was not really sure if I needed it. I really liked the compact nature of the SD series , the startup time and the shooting speed. But, I wanted something better than the point and shoot camera. I was really worried about the flash capability of compact cameras. With S80 I could reuse my battery back. Even though I could not use my Compact flash memory, but I think SD memory is really nice with S80. And I really liked the shooting modes the S series provided and decided to buy S80. I have been using this camera for over 3 months and really love it (I am so glad that I leaned towards S80)."
1,Dead on arrival,"After seeing the fabulous reviews here on Amazon, I ordered this camera. It arrived with an ""E18"" error. Never even got to take a single shot! Caveat Emptor."
5,A Note About Video Sound Quality,"Others have commented on all the great features of this camera, so I will just focus on one flaw I noted in recording videos.There is often a slight whine in the sound recorded with videos on this camera. If there is a lot of background noise it isn't too noticable but in quiet settings it can be a bit distracting. The noise is not apparent when playing back on the camera but is noticable when you play the donwloaded video on a computer.Other than that, it is a wonderful camera that I would highly recommend."
2,Need repair again (second time),"I had a S45 and after loving that camera and quite frankly beating the heck out of it taking photos of two kids and needed a new one. I am now needing repair for the second time. After buying the canon camera bag, I managed to drop it after having it for all of three weeks and the lense cracked. Now 13 months later I can't get the lense cover to close. Very frustrating."
3,Its ok,"This camera compromises on a lot to fit it all in. Thus it does not do any one thing super well. But it does do many things.The image quality I would prefer to have a slightly oversaturated color. I almost always have to tweak outdoor pictures.Does not take good indoor(low light) photo's compared to other smaller cameras, flash overfill.Is rather fragile.The lens distortion is huge when trying to capture vertical items.Video is adequate.Probably the best camera out there with all the features and still fits in your pocket. But a lot of compromises.If you want better outdoor and event photos, and don't need to fit in your pocket, definately look else where, something with a bigger lense.For indoor photos or basic outdoor photos, one of the smaller pockets would do."
4,A worthwhile purchase,I have an 1800ES. I found the book to be a decent history produced by a credible source. If you like older Volvos you will appreciate having this book.
4,Well written interesting history of the P1800.,"The Volvo P1800 has an interesting history and this book is a well written and researched account of it. Buy the book if you're interested in the origins of the car, the design, who the people were and so on. I would have liked to see some more information on production changes, but thats really the only fault I could point out. This is not a book for a buyer wanting the detailed ins and outs of the model - but then it doesn't claim to be that either."
1,BUYER BEWARE,I have three Blu-ray players including a Playstation 3 with 3.72 firmware. The Blu-ray will not play in any of these devices and complains about the encryption keys not being available to decrypt this Blu-ray movie.Update:I got my PS3 to work with it by updating the the firmware. The other two Blu-ray players still refuse to play the movie. :-(
2,"Most of the CD was okay, but...","There were noticeable mistakes in the Pianists movement of ""Carnival of the Animals"". Really, really noticeable mistakes. That shouldn't happen in a piece that consists entirely of major scales."
3,Not really worth getting,"Since this single has been release, a newer edition of 'Cookie Mountain' has come out that includes 2 b-sides and a new remix, one of those b-sides being 'Things You Can Do' and the other, 'Snakes & Martyrs', appears on the vinyl version of this single. The single track is excellent, a full 5 stars, while the presented b-sides is a bit lacking, but still nice. I'd also like to note that, while this is the the album version of the single, you can find the edited version on single track UK editions, which are rather hard to find. Basically, if you're not a collector, don't bother with this release (though the 'Province' and 'Staring At The Sun' singles both come with previously unreleased material, and are great additions to your TVotR library).Tv On The Radio are one of those bands that may overtime become either really fickle or may lose interest in keeping up with the music-making, so getting every little bit of this terrific band is, in my opinion, a must!"
5,Every one should read this book,"I think this is a book that has the taste that people like to read. They each have their own most clearest or should I say vivid memory. My favorite ones are Mary Annes, Mallorys, Kristys, Shannons, Claudias, and Logans. But I liked everyones.This is a MUST-READ book for everyone. I simply loved the book."
5,awesome book,"since we all know what this book is about already I want to take this opportunity to express where I see each of these baby sitters 15-20 years later:claudia and stacey living sharing a fancy apartment in new york with claudia being an art teacher, jewelry designer or fashion photographer; or stacey and claudia getting into fashion design and starting a line togetherkristy coming out of the closet(come on we all know she's gay!) and playing sports in women's teams, or becoming a social workerMary Anne becoming an animal doctorDawn becoming trailer trash and marrying a rich old yuppiemallory becoming a book writer of some sort or a journalistjessi becoming a famous broadway star in local ballets and musicals and also doing some hip hop and becoming a back up dancer for a famous artistshannon becoming an astronomer or a drama teacherLogan being in college for 10 or more years and being all pimped out and the ladies manthere you have it, remember THIS"
2,Not worth listening to,"I got this for my kids on the basis of the review and the idea behind it-having animals talk about their situations in songs. The singer has a very high soprano, that's too syrupy for me and made the lyrics unintelligible. My kids were barely interested, and so it has only been played once."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"On my Sony A-330 DSLR, this filter caused both focus and exposure problems. Auto exposures were consistantly underexposed. The camera appeared to have no problems auto focusing, but the resulting images were frequently blurry. By using manual exposure, and manual focus, I was able to get some nice images with this filter, but that is often inconvenient. The ring on this filter is quite thick, so vignetting is likely with wider angle lenses. A filter at this price range is not going to be multi-coated, so in-lens reflections can occur when shooting towards the sun.I later purchased the Hoya 55mm DMC PRO1 Digital Circular Polarizer. This costs much more, but has been yielding excellent results, without any of the problems I had with the Sunpak."
3,CP Circular Polarizing Filter,"NOT what I was expecting. Got this filter for a digital SLR camera, because the write ups all say that the newer digital cameras require circular polarizing filters as newer cameras will not work with the older type of linear polarizing filters. The downside, is that this type of polarizing filter does NOT cut out the reflection and glare as well as the linear one.I guess one just has to use this because the way newer camera work, they don't (always) work with the linear PFs. (Something to do with the light metering systems and auto focus functions.) In any event, it is something I have to keep experimenting with, and maybe just get used to using."
4,"Reliable, fairly quiet","Not the quietest power supply I've used, but certainly not noisy by any means. It has been reliable, and is nicely put together. My case is odd - the power supply is exposed and visible, so it is nice to have something that looks a bit better than your standard cheap metal power supply."
4,Good balance of cost and quality,"My Antec EA500 has worked fine for half a year. It is not the noisiest fan in my system, though not silent either. It is pretty heavy, which usually indicates high quality."
5,Great power supply,"This has been a great power supply. It has plenty of connectors and has been able to satisfy the load without issue. I can't ask for much more, especially since it has lasted for well over a year."
5,Fabulous book,"This book is really 10 star rated. These authors seem really dedicated and this is a ""must read"" for anyone living in a deed restricted community.I had a condo in Brentwood, CA, served on the Association Board for 6 years and never thought twice about where I was living. After reading this book, I couldn't put a ""For Sale"" sign out front fast enough!!The book is cleverly written , filled with the right kind of advice, all the while making one want to continue reading while laughing at some of the titles and humor.I have read the book again since moving out of my condo and every time i read a chapter title, i can't wait to see what is written there.The price of this book is certainly less than the cost of hiring an attorney for any HOA advice.I would like to personally thank the authors for changing my life!"
1,I did not listen to this album and never will,"I am a black man in his late 20's who has experienced to buety of true hip that was created before 1995...So @ this point i must tell you that i am not a wigga nor am i a preppy black guy from the burbs (raw streets of Brooklyn, BiIchs)Enough about me.. On to this album... I will never listen to rap again (other than classics created by NAS and Little Brother)The song Laffy (...)Taffy has ruined my love for the art form that was @ once great. People have no concept of lyrics nor good music.I thought whistle while you twirk and tah joint by tag team was bad. (...)disgusting.Hip Hop is officialy Deadthis was more of a rant, not a review. But frankly, i just don't give a d@mn.."
1,Crap,What happened to good rap like from the 90's when rap was raw and gutter..Now rap very mainstream and corny sounding all rappers are doing the crunk music sound which sucks..So if you like wack rap that talks about clubbing blin bling and girl then this is for you......If your looking for good gangsta rap then stay away from this poprap it's artist like this that made g funk died out...
1,Ozzyapu is 100000% correct,Id write a review but Ozzyapu wrote a top notch review. I just want to give this POS a lower rating that it deserves. Just pick up albums from the rappers he recommended and see why todays rap is garbage yet people go retarded about fiddy and mike jonez TI and paul wall.
1,ALL BOARD A ONE STAR TRAIN IS TAKING AFFECT TO A TRIP TO THE TRASH,These Cats Are Clowns looking like BOzOs Laffy Taffy Worst Single in the history of music. If You Have this trash kill Yourself or what on this list kill yourselfCASSIECHINGY50 CentKhia
1,F--k This S--t,"Man i wish i could grab a gun and kill the one who signed this motherf***ing posers!!! F**k this band this should be on Guinness World Records titled as the ""The Worst Album Ever Made On the Whole Universe"". This band is bad in everything. If you like this s--t, then you should hang yourself. Here's the rap you should be listening to:Dr. DreSnoop Dogg (early stuff)The Notorious B.I.G.2pacNasJay-ZPublic EnemyN.W.A.Ice CubeEazy-EEric B. & RakimDe La SoulRun-DMCThe Wu-Tang Clan.NEVER BUY THIS OR YOU'LL BE REGRETING IT TILL THE DAY YOU DIE.P.S: Why there is no 0 star option? Amazon, start working on that because artists like this should deserve not even 1 star."
1,They really are down for life,"This motherf***ers have no talent and that retarded Laffy Taffy song is bulls**t. These guys make Mike Jones and Lil Jon look talented. I'd prefer that crap Yugioh movie than this.These guys need to shake their Laffy Taffys out of the music industry and spare us the brain-melting. Go listen to AC/DC, Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd. Or better yet, anything else."
3,ive herd worse cds,"this is their first cd right? tell me how many first cds youve herd that were amazing? this cd is very good fer the groups first laffy taffy is kew and bankhead is kew too, buy it, its only 15 bux er something thats wat i payed at a store. and its only money..."
4,Yeah!,I love the song - Laffy Taffy. That is my favorite song =] I bought the CD right when it came out yesterday.
1,D4L is trash,This c.d. is horrible. We have to band groups like these because they make Hip-Hop look bad. They make the South look bad. Outkast please show these clowns how it's done.
1,Somebody call the Boooooooooo patrol!!!!,"I need a casio keyboard to woo all the morons who bought this cd and make a hot single myself. I'd rather listen to Whoomp! There it is! 27 times straight and watch The View while having a root canal done by Corbin Bernsen then listen to this. Maybe I'm a little extreme, actually, i'm not. If you listen to this your children will probably end up extremely half-witted (but we can always hope you don't reproduce) watching re-runs of Step by Step (the Balki episodes) eating a can of spam. You have just been served a review of justice, go now! and save yourself and children from this mindless fiddle faddle."
1,iditotic,an insult to rap. these idiots took a dump on some terrible annoying beats and packaged it for whatever dumb southern loyalist would buy the trash. i am embarassed that i even thought about buying it.
1,D4L CAN'T BE SERIOUS,"O'k be it that LAFFY TAFFY is a hit, this group fooled the fans because this is one of the worst C.D's I've heard in a long time. Bad business Mike Jones."
1,Words can't describe.....,"I can't believe someone would actually produce these clowns called D4L....they are THE worst rap group, it pisses me off because they suck so bad and are giving rap a bad name. Dance Music???? Their melodies suck ass, their appearance is so disguisting i wanna throw up, and who ever likes this group has no taste in music."
1,Worst Group Ever Hands Down!,"This has got to be the worst album ever. With beats that a 5 year old could make D4L gives new reasons to mock the south. The sad thing is people like these folk makes it so UGK, Face, Jody Breeze and other talented southren artist get pushed to the back and go wood. I hope women wise up one day and stop suporting music that degrades and cop some uplifting music. I'm sick of all these wack rappers dropping Big and Pac turning in they graves."
1,I am not hating!!!!!!!,"Why in the hell now a days if you don't like something your hatin. First and formost these guys suck, so what am I hating on. You have to have something I want to hate on someone. There group that will be around for about a year more, diapeare, go underground never be heard from again. If I could be someone it wouldn't be D4L.This ain't a jelousy thing people, it is this is not a very good group thing. You want a good rap cd go get Ant Banks Do or Die. Peace"
1,OHHHHHH MYYYYYYYY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,No such thing as hating on this page! All the musical geniuses are rolling in there graves! This is Kindergarden bubblegum TRASH!! NO More CheeseBall Gangstas!! I can step on a keyboard and get a better beat out of it!
1,D4L (Dead 4 Life),"This is sad. The city I was born and mostly raised in has discrased music critically. This is just as bad as Dem Franchise Boyz and their White Tees. Since when rapping about candy became the sh*t? Laffy Taffy is fruity, just like this CD. And whats really sad? People on TV and here in Atlanta are dancing their behinds and saying the words to the song like it's the coolest thing ever. Not to mention the production sounds like a keyboard bought at Toys R Us and took 5 minutes to make, and most of them sound the same. Betcha Can't Do It Like Me got heavy rotation here in the ATL and that beat sounds almost identical to Laffy Taffy. I'm going to say what I said on the Chingy album, people will buy albums no matter how garbage or stupid it sounds. I wonder how many CD they sold. They can add one, because I was stupid for buying this. Now its laying on I-75."
1,i guess mike jones just wanted more cuts in his mouth singing them,When you listen to this album you wonder what creativity has come to. This was hard on the border. No rapping skillz lame beats and no creativity. In their suprising hit shake that Laffy Taffy I am still trying to figure out the meaning of the bar I want a durrnanan oh cause you so thick girls call me.... I guess that was thaught to them by the master himself mike jones who often repeats his lyrics in different song he told them just say durrrnana oh. I gues uncreative pople together in a studio makes no good mixture. There you have them D4L down for life and thats how their gonna stay down from leising cars thatnx to mike jones but they will be down from creativity and skills. Dont pruchase this get some real music like albums negro league-the team or sounds of revenge-chamillionare or the new lil wayne. just dont buy this trash or ull be down 4 life....
1,It's all down hill from here,"This has got to be one of the worst albums I've ever heard. The writing is awful, the rapping is stupid and every song execpt Bankhead is flat out stupid. This album gave me a headache. Avoid this trash at all costs. This debuted at #22 on the billboard charts. Laffy Taffy is the worst song I've heard all year and may be the worst song of the decade. This is one of the year's worst albums."
5,goin tizzzop!!,I dont no why all of u hatin on em just cause theyre new... i luvd this album and listen 2 it for hours at a time. its sorta funny that someone would take advice from people that cant even spell d4l! But like I said great album go get it....... holla
1,"D4L, Is downfully Awful.","Down 4 life is a terrible album, with that idiotic song Laffy taffy and other terrible songs, the writing is pathetic, the rapping is awful, the beats are ridiculous and everything else is headache inducing.Down 4 Life should called Down 4 deathThis is one of the worst albums of the year."
1,Derivative For Life,"No wonder I loathe the majority of rap and hip-hop. It's because of no talent *ssclowns like D4L trying too hard to make music, but coming up with lyrics stolen from quality rap artists like Eazy-E and Dr. Dre and dumbing them down with something that a 12-year-old trendy would come up with.I suggest that you DON'T buy this. Go for these if you want quality rap/hip-hop:""Enter The Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers"" by Wu-Tang Clan""Straight Outta Compton"" by N.W.A.""Eazy-Duz It"" by Eazy-E""The Chronic"" by Dr. Dre""It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back"" by Public EnemyAnd this is speaking from a person who prefers technical death metal and grindcore over anything these days."
1,More Pop Garbage,"With their craptastic hit pop song ""Laffy Taffy"", the extremely low talent pop rap group Down For Life has spit in the face of real rap music. Just read the lyrics to ""Laffy Taffy"" and try telling me that it is a real artistic effort. Pop rap artists like Paul Wall, Down For Life, Ying Yang Twins, and Slim Thug have ruined rap music. For some real quality rap music, check out Tupac, Public Enemy, Beastie Boys, Wu Tang Clan, or NWA. Anyone who likes garbage like Down For Life needs their head examined."
1,Down For Life - Down For Life,"Its music like this, right here that shows what garbage is popular now days. Has anyone in here actually read the lyrics to this song. If you have the time, please do. It will show you how ignorant and how horrible some people are at writing lyrics. Theres tons of better hiphop artists out there that deserved to be supported, and not this garbage. Ive hardly heard anything from this album. But by hearing ""Laffy Taffy"", this definately shows me that they are capable of absolutely nothing, and have no talent what so ever. They cant rap, they cant write, and the Laffy Taffy beat is extremely a horrible beat, that probably took about 10 minutes to make. DO NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT buy this album."
1,I agree with everyone else,"I am a man who loves his classic rock, but I don't shun modern music. However though, I just hate bands like these who add Absolutly nothing to to the music scene other than giving people urges to gouge their ears out. This is just terrible. Laffy Taffy is the worst song of the year.We need some good music to come out. I can't say that much, other than this stuff will be on it's way. Read the other reviews as well, they all know what they are talking about, but I am just adding the back up, for the sake of power in numbers."
1,move over T-Pain...........,"There's an even more retarded pop act in town.If you write songs such as ""bankhead"" and ""Laffy Taffy,"" your 15 minutes of fame will dry up, fast."
1,Garbage,D4l need to go back in the studio and re write their lyrics. This album is wack and isn't worth the money.
4,entertainment,"great 'club' album to dance and have fun to.and to just generally sit around and enjoy the crazy tone of the lyrics.I listen to music from classical to rap.And I respect and give any artists who has the balls to put their product out there kudos.their are veterans and current rappers who focus on intellectual and socioeconomic subjects. and if I want to sit around and discuss certain things I will listen to them.but after a hard days work, i just want some mind numbing entertainment.and this is one of the records that delivers.I wonder if the critics in any field are as well paid as those they critique?"
2,It's Okay,"It's just okay. Nothing special about the group except that song, ""Laffy Taffy"", which is a little more than a 19th-century version of the ""Hoochy Koochy"" song performed by sideshow dancers at turn of the century amusement parks. The video of the same name features women who could pass as harem ladies and belly dancers from the 1893 Chicago's World Fair."
1,You've got to be kidding me!,"This is by far one of the worse things I've ever heard. Right up there with Chingy or Changy or whatever it is. They should be ashamed. It's a miracle that can say ""Laffy Taffy"" and still show their faces in public. For shame for shame. For the record, D4L, to para-quote your own lyrics, No ""I can't do it it like you"" nor would I want to. I would never suck so bad. 1 Star here it comes."
1,Rap Has Reached An All Time Low,"Man, f*** this album, look at the album cover, theres a h0m0 wearing a pink shirt, thats G@Y, you know this crap will be down right corny & stup!d, these foos look corny, i bet the only people that like this cd are airheaded females, Laffy Taffy is the dumbest and the most stup!dest song ive ever heard in my life, I thought 50 Cent's Candy Shop was the worst but man, this has reached an all time low. the chorus on this song is straight up G@y, I mean, who da hell wanna dance to this song? well only newbies in music dance this song which is you teenage airheads, yall like that song thanks to that fast rappin artist name Twista, who came out the closet droppin another whackness, Wish he came back to his adrenaline rush days but he turned G@y and join these non-heter0sxual skittle wearin bozo's name ""Down 4 Life"", This has to put to a stop"
1,"Simply vile, awful beyond belief!","I ordered this from the UK as it is not available there mainly because of all the rave reviews. However I have discovered that it is the auteur himself who is writing these 5 star reviews. The film is simply awful beyond belief. I have not the words to describe how bad this film is. From the orange sepia filter that has been put on everything to hide bad sets and art direction to the laughable dialog that would have a porn film director hang his head in shame, one wonders what Anthony Quinn was doing in this vanity project. My guess is that he was so old and sick that he was happy to take any work especially if it paid well. I also imagine that this man Shokof was wealthy enough to offer him a hefty fee. There is a weird homoerotic threrad in the film which if the director was honest enough could have evolved into a Derek Jarman, Kenneth Anger type thing but the film is so pretentious that any redeeming feature is deeply buried. Simply vile!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!,"This review book could not be any more frustrating. It seems as though PPI2Pass simply issued a new edition and copyright of 2006 as a marketing tactic only. I challenge them to show what the revisions actually are. For the April 2006 Structural I Exam there is a choice to use ASD or LRFD for Steel Design. This book begins every steel question with, ""Using ASD...""In addition, there loads of errors which I have reported over a month ago and have still not heard a response or seen an errata on the website.Beware!! PPI2Pass only wants your money on this one! The Structural Engineering Reference Manual on the other hand is outstanding!The complaints listed here are not exhaustive by any means. Just save your time and money and look elsewhere for review materials. The NCEES review book for the Struct I Exam is great also.Good Luck!"
3,Okay study option,This book provided some additional problems to work while studying for the exam. But there was not enough similarity to the actual exam problems to make it a great study aid.
2,Same questions as previous edition,The second edition has identical questions as the first edition. The only differences are with answers affected by changes in codes. (Phi factors etc..) Don't waste you're time if you already have a copy of the first edition. Just be aware of what code changes might affect your answers.
2,Well-crafted questions,"The problems presented in this book are carefully constructed to illuminate code nuances in the soutions. I give the problems in this book four stars (****).These are not six-minute solutions; catchy title, it may be. The solutions in this book are often gibberish, with either code errors, mechanics errors, or both. The code errors sometimes reference an obsolete code and sometimes reference inapplicable sections of the code. The mechanics errors appear to be sometimes careless and sometimes the result of non-comprehension. At the same time, I acquired some new techniques, especially with regard to geotechnical soutions. I rate the solutions in this book two stars (**)."
1,Defective item delivered.,Our factory reconditioned model arrived in non-working order. It is defective and in need of repair. This was my first reconditioned purchase from Amazon.
1,broken,"Mine arrived in a beat-up box with a non-closing tank door and a broken side. It also makes various disturbing noises. I've had dehumidifiers before and I know they can be loud but this is something else - it buzzes, clatters and sounds just plain broken. Also, the hose is dirty. I don't know if it was damaged in transit or poorly reconditioned but I suspect the latter."
2,Poor Durability,"Worked for 2 seasons. I'm handy and can fix many items. This unit will fail because of design, and repair is not economically practical. Given the useful life, I recommend another brand. Compressor runs, coils ultimately rust and fail."
2,Good......then not so good.,I got this phone for a lot of reasons but was very disappointed. First Verizon charged me there 35 Dollar activation fee even when the description states the activation was free. And the battery life on this phone is substandard. If I use the phone it will not last me a day. I always have to keep on the charger. Very discouraging.
3,Good headphones if you don't use the noise cancelling,"Well, the headphones I have are RCA noise cancelling 40mm ""Dynamic Sound"" Noise cancelling and look a little different from the picture because they are all black.The pair I have, all that the noise cancelling switch does on these headphones is turn on a background white noise that sounds kind of like constant ocean waves. Not what I was expecting and I got the impression that if you listen this noise for a long time it would drive me crazy and could potentially damage hearing listening to the same pitch that long. Not to mention it covers up the music.Anyway, I just leave the switch turned off and they sound good. If you are looking for some nice sounding headphones for listening at home they seem good for the money. If you are looking for noise-cancelling (aka: white noise) I'd probably try something else."
2,decent ... but thats not saying much,"The only reason this gets a 2 is because it was dirt cheap ($9) if not I'd give it a 1 ...Here's the blow by blow very quickly1. The headphones don't cover your ears completely, some of you may like that ... I don't really2. The noise reduction thing works ... a little ... maybe 30 - 50% reduction ... but there is a hum/buzz when there is no music playing3. The worst part of these headphones is that the battery sits right above your right ear, but the cover for it isn't very secure, so it will flop open at the slightest touch ... very annoying and pretty much ruins the entire experience because you're perpetually repositioning the battery and shutting the compartment.If someone gives this to you for a gift ... take it ...Don't spend your money on it.You were warned."
3,Interesting Documentary,"This is a interesting documentary of a vacation that Prince Aly Khan took his wife Rita Hayworth on. I would recommend it for any true fan of Rita Hayworth. I think it might be a little boring for others. It candidly shows the end of Prince Aly and Rita's marriage. It was to be a sort of a second honeymoon, but when the couple is shown together, they seem so distant. All in all, I enjoyed seeing Rita more as a regular person, and not the ""love goddess"" the studios portrayed her as."
2,Not great....,"I purchased this for a research paper on the Bush Doctrine, and it had nothing to do with the Doctrine. I'm not sure it even mentioned it. Unless you know NOTHING about just war theory, this really skims the very basics and isn't helpful at all if you any knowledge in F.P. or I.R. It really isn't even helpful for strengthening arguments or prior research, don't waste your money."
2,not realy good....,"not as good as the pods should be in other then illy espresso mashines, perhaps the taste good if espresso is made in the original mashine; no typical strong espresso"
1,Would not brew in my senseo,"I bought these specifically for my senseo coffee maker and they brewed water. I generally love Illy espresso as it's one of the best espresso's carried in stores, but the single serving pods did not work and every time I tried to use them, they were wasted. So I basically spent a good amount on money and never got an espresso."
2,"Fine espresso, but not as pictured","Espresso was fine. However, the photo is misleading. Was disappointed that it did not come in the tin as shown in the photo, instead the espresso was packaged in a cardboard box. Fine enough, but specifically purchased because the photo showed the tin. Will buy from a different vendor in the future."
2,Very misleading and Very disappointed!!,"Very disappointed that it did not come in the tin as shown in the photo, instead the espresso came in a cardboard box. I bought it mainly for the tin to reuse for coffee. I will not buy from this seller again as very misleading with the picture!!"
1,Not what I ordered,I ordered the pods on the metal can and go the ones on a cardboard box. This is misleading. I can get the card box one cheaper elsewhere.
2,Not correct packaging,"These are the correct Illy pods, but are individually (and wastefully) packaged in boxes, rather than in a vacuum-sealed tin."
2,It was okay,"I didn't realize when I bought this that it is not really an adult-geared book. The stories are very short and written in very elementary terms, apparently targeted at children. Left me wanting more information about the animals."
3,Review of book Shelter Dogs: Amazing Stories of Adopted Srays,I was disappointed with the book because I didn't realize it was written for such young readers. I thought it would be a book full of heartwarming stories of shelter dogs but something seemed to be lacking.
5,Opened my eyes,This review showed me the positive side of shelter dogs as well as their joy. I'd always thought they would be dogs with too much baggage for a normal person to handle. Touching stories and full of love.
5,Shelter Dogs: Amazing Stories of Adopted Strays,I loved this book for its positive aspects of adopting shelter dogs who give such unconditional love even after some horrific conditions they may have gone through. This is definitely a book for dog lovers or anyone who wants to feel good about people or organizations who look out and care for dogs.
3,nice book,I was taking a comm 101. For a speech and dont need this book any more and don't know why I bought it.
4,Don't Give Up,"If only I had a zillion dollars, I'd adopt every animal in a shelter. These animals definitely received a second chance and they proved they were totally worth it. This was a cheering book, even though one knows there are many more animals waiting to be given that second chance. Read the book and be amazed."
1,"Fast shipping, great price.","The Briggs and Straton coil arrived in good shape, within a week.Great so far.About 2-3 weeks later, I got around to installing the part on my garden tiller.No spark.Since electrical parts are usually not returnable, I guess I'm out $20.00I think it's not the sellers fault, I really don't believe he knowingly sold me a defective part."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,OEM coil decided to go out so I found this one over Internet. No dealership around so I was able to find this one and it works very well.. No problems and perfect fit.
2,What?????,"You have got to be kidding me. There was only one conflict in this book, a stupid misunderstanding, that was stretched across 180 pages to be resolved in one page. One page! That was terribly unsatisfying. The first half of the book was so hateful and drawn out that I forced myself to keep reading, because this book had a five star rating at the time.I can only describe the heroine as an insecure cowardly liar. I liked Guido, though. You never doubted his feelings for Amber and even when he tried to be cruel, he would soften.The ending was so abrupt, that I wish the author had cut out 10 pages from the hideous almost wedding scene, that dragged on half the book, and put those 10 pages to a satisfying resolution. This was my first Kate Walker book and hopefully it will be my last. If you like this genre, I would suggest Lucy Monroe instead. She actually has moments where the hero and heroine enjoy each other for a few minutes."
1,Worthless after 1 month,Someone in our company purchased this for a short term project. Good thing too because it soon died. It won't uplink to either a 1000 or 10/100 port what so ever. The best I get now is 100mb between two computers plugged into this switch. It's worthless for anything else.Being a Network Manager for a 42000 person company where we use Cisco gear (there's a great sticker on it about Upgrading to Cisco) I believe Cisco should be truly embarrased to have their name on such a product.
1,Big Piece of Junk,I have had the Linksys SD2005 switch replaced by Cisco 3 times and each time it never lasts more than 4 months. It starts dropping packets even at 100 mb speeds and eventually cannot even keep up at kilobit speeds. If you don't keep this switch on ice it will fail in just a few months.
1,died after 8 months,"Like the many other reviewers, this product worked for a short time and then started to lose packets like nobody's business. DON'T BUY!"
1,Went bad after just over a year,"Having to buy a new 1GB switch because this one went dead, too far past warranty to replace."
3,Compatibility issues with MacBook Pro,"I didn't think there was much to like/dislike about a cheap 'dumb' switch but I've just recently purchased a 15"" MacBook Pro (Late 2008) and it flat out will not connect to this switch. It doesn't even recognize that the cable has been plugged in. I tried various cables. I use this switch with a Dell D620 laptop and a Mac mini just fine. But no luck on the MBP."
3,Cause of packet loss,"I'm an instrumentation repair technician for a large environmental laboratory. The IT department replaced one of these switches because it had terrible packet loss(the metal shell type) and i snagged it up. The more i can learn about hardware failure modes, even on something as cheap as a network switch, the better i can perform my job.I disassembled the switch to discover that it has what is commonly known as ""capacitor plague"" so this one did not teach me anything. That's right, the packet loss is due to defective capacitors. Assuming you have capacitors and proper tools, you can repair one of these switches in about five minutes.I gave a three star review because I really don't have much experience with the device, all that i know is that it was in service for about 2 years in a very, very rough environment and now i have a spare gb switch."
1,Don't buy this,"I've had the same problems as everyone else. After a few months, my connection dropped constantly. When it did work, my connection to my computers were 10mbps or 100mbps. At first I thought it was a problem with my gigabit cards; then I started swapping in new cables. As soon as pulled my headless computers from where they were to test on a monitor (my TV), they magically had full gigabit speeds. I never expected a 4 month old switch to go bad. I've never had any of my electronics go bad after just 4 months. Now I see that there were many of people just like me. Why wasn't there a recall?"
1,Caution: Bad Switch Design for SD2008 and SD2005,"We purchased four SD2008 and two SD2005 units and have experienced packet loss in the range of 80%. The effective rate of the switch is about 20MBS; much lower than a standard 100MB switch and has the added bonus of clogging up the Gigabit network.Linksys, thank you very much for wasting our time (12+ engineering hours on this product). Simple testing of large file data transfer rates would have detected this issue before this green apple hit the market.Our units are now on RMA, hopefully the Rev. 1.1 design will solve the problem. Until then you may want to consider the Netgear GS608."
1,poor reliability / performance after only a few months of use.,"I work in systems/network support. Our department has bought 6 of these switches over the past year (not all in one purchase, but 1 at a time as needed). 3 out of the 6 have now failed as others have mentioned in their reviews. The switches worked great for the first few months, but suddenly failed. Post-failure, they provide a 'gigabit' link, but throughput is < 100 Kbps. If I could give this switch zero stars, I would. Don't waste your money on this switch."
1,Low quality junk that will die on you,"You'll get the switch, you'll love it and write a great review. Then in a few weeks or months it will start going flakey. Eventually it will die completely. You'll hate it. Do us all a favor and wait a few months before you a write a breathless review about how great this is, and you'll save a lot of people trouble. Cisco should be sued over the uniformly poor quality of these switches.Here's a hint: if a company like Cisco won't put their name front and center on a product, it's probably because they're cutting corners. LinkSys is the brand Cisco uses when they want to sell crap but don't want to tarnish their own image. Real IT people know the LinkSys is Cisco's code for ""we really phoned in this one."""
1,v2.1 Failed after 1 year,I bought two of these for my home. After about one year of use both of them started failing. They would no longer auto-negotiate with some network cards and wouldn't connect at all at Gigabit speeds. Apparently this is fairly common for these.I RMA'd both of them and am still waiting for replacements.
2,do not buy this product,"As others have said, it worked fine for about a year. Now, it randomly disconnects and seems to run at 10baseT speeds. (I've tried replacing all of the Ethernet cables, so they are not the problem.) This is unacceptable. I can't remember having a newly purchased electronic device fail so quickly."
2,Disappointing,"I had read On the Wings of Heaven as well as The Messengers with Nick Bunick. I loved both books but was extremely disappointed in the fact that this book wasn't more about Nick. Also, credit was not given to Joseph Crane in regards to the Gate of Grace and the healing techniques given by Archangel Michael to Joseph Crane. Furthermore, healing should never include pressing into pain."
3,I did not like it,I bought this CD with great illusion but it does fulfill my Latin jazz taste. I think it just has the Miles Davis's original melody with a poor Latin rhythm section.
4,Pioneer life in Eastern Washinton,I've read three of her books and loved them all. I do live where the story takes place and that makes them special.
2,didn't like it much,Dr. Avril Crump is a scientist who accidently starts up an old scientific experiment that makes 3 clones. Avril tries to keep her clones a secret from the evil Dr. Blut. It doesn't take long for Dr. Blut to find them and capture Avril and her clones. Will they be able to make it out alive? Read Avil Crump and The amazing Clones to discover their fate!What did you like or not like about the book?The story really didn't hold my attention well. It seems too far fetched to really imagine.This book would be good for kids who have an interest in science. It can bring up good discussions on cloning.
2,Better than nothing,"I bought this for about $20, wanting a cheap connection from my portable mp3 CD player to my car CD player, which can't play mp3s. I wish I hadn't. It's an interesting little gadget, but besides the novelty value, the reception - or rather, FM connection - is not very good. It sounds like AM radio and you have to sometimes switch the frequency on the transmitter to get better reception from your external device (in my case, my portable mp3 CD player) even if the car radio is set to one frequency.Overall, the experience is not very satisfactory and definitely not a pleasure."
2,Poor reception,Reception from CD Walkman tuned in to car FM radio station was very muffled and inconsistant. Would not recommend. I'm returning the item tomorrow.
1,Don't waste your money on it even though it's cheap,"The reception is very bad. I agree with the other reviewer. the FM sounds like AM, and I have trouble finding the acceptable frequency. Bad product. I have to return it"
1,"Avoid this product, not worth $20, or even $2.","I bought an RCA MM70FM transmitter to use in the car with my Creative Zen Nano. I've tried two different cars and a home stereo and cannot get it to work with any of them. If the 88.X band in your area has any local radio stations broadcasting in it, this device will simply not work. It's designed to conform to FCC codes, which means it has to accept ""intereference"" from other sources, meaning the radio stations will override the frequency and overpower your little MP3 player or CD player, resulting in signal quality that ranges from poor to non-existant.Avoid this product. The limitation to the 88.X band and the poor signal strength result in it being useless for anyone in a metro area."
1,Worthless!,I bought this at the mall on clearance for 15.99 thinking I nabbed a serious bargain. The reception is SO poor that there is static even when the units are in close proximity. I tested it in many applications - it's completely useless.
3,Chinese but it worked,"My door now shuts completely, It is of inferior quailty than the original, but my door does not rattle anymore."
2,"Justine, a desperate try of scandal.","I've read this book without any prior knowlogde of its content. Only background information on Sade as anyone else could have. It has surprised me the low level philosophy that he tries to work with (I have to admit that some paragraphs were too much for me so I put in practice my rudiments of quick reading methods, basically jumping words). What I find most interesting about the book is the fact that his author has passed to the history of literature just by scandalizing. This is perhaps his best contribution. For the rest a lot of sexual content with the 'morbo' of being reported by a virteous young girl. I have the feeling that some of the content of the book could be forbidden in our times with charges of pederastia if it wouldn't be a classic. Another paradox, as much of the sex-related issues in our times."
5,Great Insights,"I am a student of Leadership and find this book very interesting in terms of format, insights, and language. I love the organization, simplicity, presentation, and methodology used in presenting the topics. It is worth the price and the read. You will know everything about CSR reading this book. A shortcoming will be the author's choice of real world examples of success story which includes names that are not necessarily what he would have used had he known few years later their success was a fake. But the book is a simple great read and very relevant for students in leadership like me."
2,don't bother,"I finished reading this book on April 27, 1988, and in my post-reading note to myself I said: ""I have just finished a book I shouldn't have bothered to read. It is written by a greatniece of Mary Phagan, who was murdered in Atlanta on Apr. 26, 1913. It quotes a lot of the trial documentation, and the governor's commutation statement, and so it was interesting as a crime account. But I really could not empathize withe the author's resistance to a pardon for Leo Frank, tho his guilt seems clearly not psychologically indicated. In fact the author's father refuses to condemn the lynching. The book is not an inspiring one."
1,family lies,A poorly written book about a terrible incident in history. Tale of two tragegies. A young child murdered and a man convicted out of ignorance and hate. Author used inaccurate sources and family lies to cover up an excuse to convict an innocent man of a wrenching crime
1,"Biased, closed minded view of the Frank case...don't bother","The mere idea that anyone would even dare to publish a book professing their belief in Leo Frank's guilt after what has come out about the case in recent years makes one wonder if there is any decency left in the human spirit. We now know that a young boy witnessed Jim Conley carrying Phagan's body to the cellar by himself, and threatened his life if he said anything. There have also been reports that Conley confessed on his deathbed to committing the murder alone. In all honesty, Frank never really had a chance. He lived in a place where if you were of a different race or religion, and remotely linked to the murder of a sweet, innocent Christian white girl, you were as good as hanged. Under these circumstances, and in this venue, can we honestly say that Frank got a fair trial? If it had happened today, and in the North, Frank would have been acquitted. On top of all of this, the author simply can not write. Don't bother with it."
5,nice headband,I like this band much better than the one the headset came with. no foam thing pressing on your ear. the band holds the headset right over your ear.
1,Missing piece,"I was very excited to find a headband for the CS55 headset that did not include the smashing of my ear and was looking forward to using it. Although it arrived on schedule, it was missing one of the 2 cushions that provide comfort to the side of the head as shown in the photo. I packed it up and sent it back immediately for a refund, since it could not be used with such a key part missing. Very Disappointed."
5,An enriching exposure to differences and especially recommended for young viewers,"A welcome contribution to the ""Families of the World"" educational DVD series, Families Of Canada is a journey through the culture and daily life of Canada, particularly as seen through the eyes of two children: 7-year-old Hannah of Novia Scotia, who takes two busses and a ferry to her school on an island each morning, and 11-year- old John, who lives on the outskirts of the major city of Toronto. Spanning a day full of exciting activities from breakfast to bedtime, Families Of Canada is an enriching exposure to differences and especially recommended for young viewers. An ideal addition to home, school, and public library ""Other People, Other Lands"" DVD collections."
2,Not very effective,These leave a sticky film on my face that feels uncomfortable. I used them several nights in a row with no observable benefit. Would not recommend.
4,A good end to the series,"This was a good way to wrap up this series. There is always love and God in the center, as in many of her other books. It was a very good read."
1,Not what it used to be!!!!,"I have previously posted praise for the Black & Decker Piranha blades becauseof their proprietary curved cutting edge carbide tips. This was a Black & Deckerexclusive, and made their blades superior to the average blade..NO LONGER SO!.I just received this 10"" blade, and; [1]No more curved carbide tips [2] Cheaplymade VERY ORDINARY blade MADE IN CHINA!.Blades of this quality and design are available at flea markets and anyplaceCHEAP blades are sold. Went from best blade on the market to Chinese crap!Beware!"
1,Not for me,"Thought this would be easy to insert and use for multiple items. Not the case, unable to squeeze out the product and the cap falls off easily causing a mess. There's got to be a better way to dispense it."
1,Junk,I wish I would have read the negative reviews before I wasted my money on this worthless product. It's junk ... don't make the same mistake I made !
1,ball sealant,"My expensive Spalding leather volleyball was puntured when it was hit into a thorn on a tree branch. I had hoped the ball sealant might rescue the ball. I followed instructions, and ended up injecting what should have sufficed for two balls. The air pressure held fine through the night, and during about 3-4 games of volleyball. I was delighted. But then laid the ball on the grass while we were using another ball for a couple of games. When I went to take the ball home, I found it was very soft. Pumped it up several times, but it would not hold pressure. I ended up taking the ball apart to examine the small pin hole. The sealant should have worked, but didn't. It was a waste of money, except for learning what doesn't work."
1,Save your money,"Did not work. Same result as in another review. Dispenser burst open, spewing green liquid.I thought tip was clogged, but the sealant would not flow into the ball being repaired.Save your money and apply it to the purchase of a new whatever you are fixing."
2,junk,This product was a waste of money. The dispenser came apart and made a mess. The sealant did not work and the ball went flat again.
1,Useless,The tip was flimsy and broke just trying to use it. Not worth a penny. Save your money and get a new ball!
4,Drone magic from Lucier,"This is such a simple piece. A long, thin wire...as advertised...is tuned, then set into motion (in a sense, 'bowed') using an electromagnet driven by a sine oscillator, which on this release is tuned to four different frequencies for the different parts of this release. The results sometimes work, especially the last two tunings, where the wire is set into all sorts of chordal tones, harmonic reinforcements and disruptions, and it's really made to ring out in the resonant space the work is installed in. But this doesn't always work, as at least one of these is so static as to be very unchanging and as a result, not all that interesting listening. So, I can't give this four stars, even though the 'uninteresting result' is, of course, a perfectly valid end-result of Lucier's piece. But most of what's here is really nice, and works well in an Eno-like ambient vein, played back at a low level as sonic coloring. A very austere yet elegant (and elegantly-devised) work."
5,This is THE stuff,I bought this at RecRec in Zurich about 20 years ago. It was a double-disc set from Lovely Music and consists of a recording of a long vibrating thin wire. Exceptional and unique.
3,hidden intelligent,"It amazes me. That stupity still survives after who how long. The denial of talented children and adults. The reason of why goes plain stupity to age of the person, to plain I don't believe it. To I can't a ford it. It's numerous to go on! And why the school systems does very little to incourge the improvement of gifted people.And for one person found and maybe four or five.They are ignored. Held-back.Laugh at! Lost so to speak off."
4,good book,I finished this book really quick and it gave me a lot of information about the educational system and what the gifted children are going trhough...
1,Ugh!,"This is a terrible book. While it proposes to be an informative text (it's got ""How To"" in the subtitle; can't get much more informative than that), it is highly polemical and overly sentimental (two things that any piece of writing that is meant to INFORM an audience, as opposed to arguing at them, ought to avoid). It consists mainly of stories about kids who have either been messed over by the public education system or who have found an oasis within that system.Here it is, folks. Sometimes, because the public education system is largely managed by people who are not educators, kids get messed over by it. At the same time, other systems find creative ways around bureaucratic tape. In today's system (much has changed since 2004), the latter is more often the case.There: I just saved you 180 pages and $13."
5,"Unique, very readable and needed","What makes this book unique among other books on gifted education is that it's told through the eyes of the kids and their families. Empirical data, studies and theories all have their place, but Genius Denied puts the human face on it and offers practical suggestions and advice.Gifted children don't usually fit the Hollywood stereotype of ""genius"". This book should be required reading for all educators (and those involved in legislating and/or funding education) to help them see beyond the stereotype, to understand the frustration that these children and their families have, and to understand how simple the solutions can be."
2,bought this for my 10yr. old daughter...,"I was disappointed in the quality - seems cheap. Akward angle on the top, and not very powerful. Shaving with the foil side barely cuts, other side just o.k."
1,Worst BASMATI rice,"This was the worst Basmati rice I have ever tasted! California Basmati Rice should not be called Basmati!. It has absolutely different texture of the grain when cooked, and it DOESN'T have the Basmati flavour. There's no better Basmati rice than authentic asian Basmati."
1,Misleading description,"I ordered this item and was very disappointed. The description lead me to believe it came with the leaf stem handle, but it did not. Plastic lid. Very SMALL pot. NOT worth the money. Sent it back for a refund."
4,Slow start- but worth it!,"It doesn't pick up as fast as some of the other Greg Bear books that I have read, but in the end it really doesn't matter. I think that someone should turn this into a movie. If you can just be patient and make it to the third wave, you will not be able to put it down, guaranteed."
3,a bit tedious,"Short version: my first exposure to Greg Bear; seemed a bit tedious (the pacing seemed a bit off -- like in fits and starts); the climax/wrap-up went well but seemed to start too early and fold in on itself, dragging out. Some neat concepts presented and certainly a chilling and plausible future (even if he seems to be beveling the edges of his science a bit (if you know what I mean))."
2,"Turgid, trite, and meandering ... but grammar's OK","It's not that I don't like nanopunk or cyberpunk. It just happens that I really despised this book and all the vapid {nano,cyber}punk that it stands for. Although such things hardly ever bother me, I was even offended by its complete lack of moral center. Or rather, a pervasive indifference to just about everything. At least with John Varley or Tanith Lee you get the impression that sex is fun. Here, on the other hand, everything is misery, trifle, and tedium. Please, make it stop."
1,Interesting vision with cardboard characters,"I have always liked Bear, so was very disappointed with this novel. The premise is interesting, the sci-fi vision is intriguing, but the characters were not developed. I just did not care about them or their individual stories. This book felt like a collage of snapshots, not a story."
1,You know how some books are great and engaging right away?,"This is not one of those books. I bought the electronic edition of it... - and was sorely dissapointed. I've made it through about the 1st third of the book and now I've given up. The plot is as loose as overcooked spaghetti, the constant references to fake texts pompous and self-important, and the characters are stiff and wooden. Furthermore, the history and technological particulars of this future world are not at all made clear to you in any semblance of good science fiction exposition. I'm really dissapointed because I kept hearing such good stuff about Greg Bear, but frankly I'm quite underwhelmed. I was so dissapointed that I wanted to write a bad review of the book over at Peanut Press - but they don't have a customer review section, so I came here to do it."
4,Great Sequel,"Slant is a great followup to Queen of Angels. I wish I'd known that when I read it. I ended up reading this book first. Even though I read them in the wrong order, they were still great. If I had to choose, I'd have to say that Slant is the better of the two."
4,Military Grade Nano? Just say no!,"In an awful scene, Bear describes several bodies which were found hooked-up to Military Grade Nano. This allowed them to be molded like clay. The molders of these bodies were designing them for sexual pleasure. One body had strange folds of skin attached to its cheeks and when I found out what they were I became ill. Bear didn't go for the ""Gross-Out,"" this was deeper and brutally visceral. In this scene Bear makes a chilling observation: If man could, he would. I was ill with the Truth of that terrible scene.Sentient machines have not aroused sympathy from me in Sci-fi novels. Slant is a BIG exception. I cared about the Thinkers. I marveled at the prose Bear used to make these machines alive. Bear consistently describes their processes in cool mechanical terms and yet I thought warmly about them. Bear's characterization of the Thinkers alone was worth the price of the popcorn."
2,"Interesting ideas, boringly presented","I've read and enjoyed a lot of Greg Bear's work, but this book was a disappointment. The second chapter was a pointless, wandering, stream-of-consciousness exercise that I barely got through. I was tempted to throw the book away without reading any more. The rest of the book was slightly better, but the author appeared to be so tired and unexcited while he was writing."
4,/,"Excellent piece of work here. Easy to follow, a much improved writing style from ""Queen of Angels"", but should definately be read after QOA, if only to prepare the reader for the world according to Greg. I've noticed that Greg uses sub-themes in his books which seem to be more thought provoking than the actual main storyline, sexuality in Slant, and self-awareness in QOA. All very nicely done, with short extracts from imaginary books of the future. Makes me actually want to read ""The Kiss of X, Alive Contains a Lie"". The storyline with ""Jill' the thinker is superb and Roddy's menacing superiority is frightening. The manner in which Greg deals with sexuality appears to be as thoroughly researched as the sci-fi stuff, quite excellent and refreshing. Only thing I didn't like about this book was the rather limp ending. Hence: 4/5. I've you read Slant and QOA, then I recommend Moving Mars next. Decent."
3,Winning Me Over to Sci-Fi,"Greg Bear introduced me to sci-fi beyond the Star Wars extended universe. I enjoyed seeing a futuristic vision of Seattle, and Bear's anticipation of future civilization is frightening--awe-inspiring--because of its plausibility. I'm excited to read more of his literature.(Read full-length reviews on my blog! litbeetle.com/wordpress)"
1,Beyond awful,"This book was more like some teenagers perverted dream than an interesting story. Far too many different character plot lines at the start, and none of those characters are really that interesting. Futuristic porn stars and 50 year old guys with mind reading abilities who can magically get younger women to sleep with them seems more of a self indulgent fantasy on the authors part than an integral part of the story. If I wanted porn I'd check my spam folder in email."
3,"Ok, but a weak ending","I really liked the first half of the book. The world is well thought out, and even though he does introduce a lot of characters it's pretty easy to keep them distinct.However, I really thought the last fourth or so of the book was really weak, and was kind of a letdown compared to the rest of the book. I don't want to give any spoilers but some of the plot thread resolutions just did not seem satisfyingly thought out, or at least weak compared to setup they enjoyed."
4,Near-Future SciFi Holds Up Pretty Well 10 Years Later,"SLANT(1997) is a Near Future SciFi Techno Adventure. Set in the year 2052, and involving nanotechnology, AI, and medical technoadvances, it holds up pretty well ten years after it was published.In 1997, a leading edge computer was a 200Mhz Pentium running Windows 95, and the Internet was generally accessed via 56Kbps dialup modems using Explorer 3.0. While we have come a long way since then, the bottom line is that 1997 computer tech is really not that much different than today's, as far as being compared to the computer Artificial Intelligence that is described in the book.In SLANT, the Military is using Natural Gas Powered Hummvees by 2020 (could still happen, I suppose), but a ""Separatist Movement"" achieving a semi-independent Northern Idaho by the 2020's seems a bit unlikely... and the ramafications of 9/11/01 were of course hard to predict... but, thankfully, we are spared any Impending Human-Caused Global Warming Catastrophes."
2,Sold Mine. Not really feelin it.,"I like just plain-old regular trance, and this had more of a house feeling too it. Not my cup of tea!!!!"
2,Not the shown sake set!,VERY disappointing. This is not the shown sake set. The cups are rounded with molded lines at the base. There are finger holder indents on the sake glass. NOT ideal for what I wanted at all.
2,Don't BUY! Caraf is way too small!,Don't buy this set the carafe is way too small! What a ripoff! Go to reputable store and buy this kind of product.
2,Jam Sh@!,"This gun looks cool, but it loves to jam and fail. I can only have two rounds in a gun for it not to jam, and it still does at times. Not recomended for players."
3,this gun is cool,this gun is so cool i just got it today my friend shot himself and he had alot of blood i like this gun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great,"this gun is perfect and most of the bad reviews listed below were because the idiots thought it was a electric gun, THIS GUN IS SPRING OPERATED wich means u have to re cock it after every shot."
1,Sucks,"This gun is wack it reallllllllllllly suck! If you buy it you are stupid if you read this. It is made of sucky plastic, Plastic pelets only. It shoots but only 20 feet and doesnt hurt if your shot. Its like buying those toy guns in the store. The only thing tight about this is the magazine. lolDont buy this piece of S**t im telling you!!!!!!! Peace"
1,piece of crap,I just it out of the box and loaded it and shot my friend. It didnt leave a brouse.After that I shot it again thenit wouldnt shoot. If I were you I wouldnt get this piece of crap gun.
1,W T F,TO PUT IT BLUNTLY. THIS GUN SUCKS. WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF IT'S BOX I COCKED IT TO TEST IT OUT AND THE HAMMER THINGY IN THE BACK GOT STUCK UNDER THE SLIDE YOU PULL BACK TO COCK IT. DONT BUY THIS GUN. I THOUGHT IT WAS A SWEET DEAL. AND IT IS IF YOU WANT TO PRETEND TO SHOOT YOUR FRIEND. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET A UHC DUAL TONE. THEY ROCK! SEE YA.
3,works but doesn't fit 1/4 hex shank.. it's just 1/4 shank . miniature bit!!,So the issue is it drills fine once in a chuck but it's way small and is about 1.5 in overall length.. piddling bit looks to be worth 10.00
5,Travel Tips That SAVE $$$,"Since I travel extensively for my job, I thought I knew everthing about traveling and saving money. Well, I was wrong, and this book helped me save so much more by following some very simple advice by these travel experts. This book is perfect for anyone who travels for business and wants to know insider tips that help save money. Also, I never knew how to use my airline miles effectively, but Theo Brandt-Sarif really explained the best uses for miles and when to use those upgrades. Now I feel like a traveling pro and have recommended this book to my friends and family. In fact, my parents are planning their anniversary trip for next year and I've bought them a copy to help get the most of their trip. Thanks for writing this fabulous book."
4,Wonderful,"This is the first book by David Gemmell that I have read. I was looking for a break from Goodkind and Jordan, adn thought that this book sounded interesting. I was not disappointed.Connavar grows up in the shadow of his father's alleged cowardice, but with a stepfather who loves him dearly. Among his people, Conn is the only one who seems interested in finding out about the rest of the peoples around them. This curiosity sets off a series of events that determine the rest of the story. He is faced with troubles that impact his entire people. Luckily, he seems to be blessed by the gods.Conn must also face the beast inside of him---his ability for blinding anger and rage...a thirst for vengeance.This was a wonderful story and I recommend it to anyone. I will be looking for the next book."
4,"Back to Rome , but all the better for it","There is something about the Rigante Series that makes it far more readable than a lot of fantasy pulp out there and at first while I was kind of irritated by the fact that not only does the book base all it's people and geography on different from the our own word 2000 years ago but it also borrows heavily from religion , weapons, tactics and entertainment of those days....and actually that's what in the end makes it a great book, becuase you can relate for more easily to the world around the characters without having to read through pages of tripe just there to set the scene. The story is fast flowing, years leap by with the turn of a page in many places, some of the characters tend to be a bit easy to predict but all in all an enjoyable book/series and I look forwards to reading the rest and then looking at his other Drenai books."
2,Frusteratingly Obvious,"Gemmell has written a very good parallel to Roman history from the perspective of the Celts. Unfortunately Connavar, the main character and hero, is horribly one dimensional. He is a fierce warrior, and that is about it. The only character I came to like, Banounin, died as he was becoming important to the growth of Connavar as a leader. Connavar ends all conflict through threats or killing, he seems to have no thought other than anger, and vengeance. Think William Wallace of Scotland without an education. I am planning on reading the entire series for the sake of it, but if you are looking for a deeper story and characters you may want to look elsewhere. All in all the story is very good for what it is, a warrior epic, and a loosely based history."
3,Well Written But Little To Distinguish It From Other Tales,"Like two other reviewers, this was the first work by Gemmel that I have read. While well written and exhibiting the skill of an experienced author, there was little else to this tale to separate it from any number of other heroic adventures. The storyline is broadly based and familiar, lacking the focus and multilayered perspective of better works, thus causing it to fall into the category of an entertaining but far from gripping divertissement. While this work alone will not prevent me from reading other works by the author--it is afterall far better written than many--I will wait until I have exhausted richer and more original sources of material, such as Martin, Erikson, Hobb, Kerr, Kay, or Jordan, before I turn to Gemmel again."
2,"I like the concept, but the book still stunk","I like the concept of having someone right a book that modeled the expansion and rise of Rome, it's blatant that the author did so. Even though I liked the concept the book was still bad. I think that if a differnt author had wrote this then it would have been good. Much improvement is needed, the book did not seem real, or lifelike and I was never really interested. Read something else, the Wheel of Time, A Song of Ice and Fire, the Inheritance Trilogy, anything but this."
3,An interesting saga,"I enjoyed this book for it's wonderful story of a young man who is controlled by destiny and a way of life. The Rigante are a warrior tribe who tended to rely upon their strentgh rather then their strategy. Then along comes Conn the Demonblade who goes around the world extracting revenge upon the killers of his friend, wife and also to protect friends. It's a little different then Gemmell's books involving the Druss and his people but that's because it doesn't go into as much detail in the battles as he (Gemmell) usually does. I wait for a chance to read the second book in this series and hope it is similar to the first."
5,My first encountering of David Gemmell...,"...It will not be my last. The story is fast-paced, and David Gemmell has a style that permits him to span years in paragraphs and not lose the reader. The story is also like a combination of the Gauls as they were being conquered by Julius Caesar, plus the Caledonians that caused Hadrian to build his wall, crossed with the Scots under Wallace and The Bruce, with Vikings added in for good measure. The characters are proud, particularly Connavar, and they seem realistically thought out. My favorite part was how Connavar became the pupil of Banouin (I probably mispelled that)and later Jasaray, using their tutelage to learn how to defeat the ""Roman"" legions of the story. I read this book in less than 24 reading hours, most of that in one sitting, and I have already read the sequel. They will definitely not be the last of his books that I read."
3,Super Reader,"Connavar grows up fatherless, as his father died in the weather that gave him a nickname, the Sword in the Storm.When the Seidh race takes an interest in the boy, a weapon is forged for him. This gives him a new name : Demonblade.Connavar, because of his upbringing is a troubled and not overly psychologically stable individual, but does have heroic qualities."
2,Product is not what is pictured!,"I received this item and the blue illuminated cap is not present on this item. There is a less expensive product in the marketplace w/ a mere blue LED that looks similar, and that product costs about $10 less @ Best Buy. While certainly this product works satisfactorily and the price is decent, you should realize that what you're going to get is not what is pictured... unless Eforcity fixes things, that is."
1,never received,"I ordered this item, according to Amazon, and never received it. Don't believe I was billed tho."
4,On Instant Immersion-Spanish,I bought this product with another computer based version of learning Spanish and I'm just getting started. It think it will be a valuable tool in that combination. More later as I progress...
3,instant immersion spanish deluxe and work book,the instant immersion spanish deluxe is worth the money b ut it could be better. one a work book to go along with the audio cds would be nice also a couple of other audio cd's with just vocabulary words would be nice.
1,NO way,"This book is way too elementary. I sent it back to Amazon after ordering it. I was very disappointed. If you want a workbook for the CDs or for basic spanish practice, get ""Spanish in 10 minutes a Day"" instead. It's far more interesting."
4,high level [non-technical] advice,"Service Oriented Architecture has gotten considerable attention recently. The book studies its potential in improving business processes. Both within a company and between companies. There is very little here at the technical level of programming. The book is pitched at a higher level, suitable for upper management interested in improving the corporate business value. Advice is furnished on how to devise measurable goals. So that any redesign does not take place in a vacuum.It is also suggested that business agility can be enhanced. By letting a company redirect and modify existing services in an easy modular manner."
5,Full Moon : A New York City Showcase,"My seven and four year old children enjoy reading this book at bedtime. We live far away from my kids grandmothers and this book keeps their grandmothers' presence alive in their daily lives. We visited New York City this summer and Brian Wilcox' creative interpretation of America's most vibrant city is truly a delight for their young minds.In the wake of the World Trade Center disaster last September 11, I couldn't think of a more appropriate children's book to showcase New York City."
5,Full Moon,The illustrations are full of incredible detail such that you discover something new each time you read it. The story line is reminiscent for any grandmother that influenced a grandchild during the child's lifetime.
2,NO ENZYMES,"The description says that it containes Enzymes for ultra cleaning power, then right on the bottle it says ""No Enzymes"" plus the last shipment I purchased of the free and clear was 32 loads a bottle and this is only 16 loads a bottle. It does not work well, I have had to boost it with Borax and even then its not great. Very disappoineted in the misleading discription. I would not recomend this Except for wools and silks as stated on the bottle but NO WHERE in the discription."
2,Ultra concentrated???,"The description states ultra-concentrated.... the bottle states 16 loads. Turned to be very expensive. The product is ok to was delicate clothes, however to expensive for regular laundry loads."
3,trap history not trapping history,this is a book more on what kind of traps were used on animals through the history of trapping as to what kind of traps o use where now a good book if you want to have a broad history of trapping not a good book for finding out how to place a trap.
3,Personal Review,"When I started Russian, I thought this was going to be a great book. I really loved the layout of the lessons, but I was very upset by the constant errors everywhere. The book would contradict itself in many places, and this is very confusing for anyone that is trying to understand the difficult grammar."
1,"good idea, poorly executed","The Wrap worked great for me for the first couple years of use, though the plastic that houses the key and remote is of poor quality and started to fall apart after several months. No big deal, the key still worked. Until... last week, the lock somehow jammed, and I was unable to unlock the Wrap from my steering wheel. I struggled with it for quite some time and even called the 1-800 number on the key. Of course, no one answered. I left a message in a panic, and, of course, no one returned my call. The only way to remove the Wrap was to cut it open and dismantle the lock. The bf brought out his drill and chipped away at the metal and plastic. About an hour later, with a mess of metal and plastic shavings blanketing the car's interior, we removed the Wrap. Overall, a horrible experience. I would never recommend the Wrap to anyone and am searching for a new security device. Suggestions?"
2,Wrap Steering Wheel Lock,Sent in warranty card as directed; it was returned unopened - stated no mail receptacle. It is hard to install. The key won't turn unless it is lose on the steering wheel. Battery went dead in two weeks. Alarm is not as loud as I hoped. Will continue to use for a while
5,Same as the 1st only better,"Vol 2 is the same way cool guitar raunch as presented in Vol 1 only with slightly more consiatant material. 1st it finally took a label as cool as Sundazed to un earth the numerous early 60's Roy Buchanon tracks. Take your pick of Mule Train Stomp, The Finger, Trophy Run or Pretty Please. Roy's brilliance is in full evidence on these stompers. You can hear exactly why guys like Jeff Beck tried to rip him off on tone or technique. Other noteworthy trax include the rockablilly zen master Joe Maphis's multi tracked ""Water Baby Boogie"" & The Tornadoes blistering version of Link Wrays ""Swag"". You really cant estimate the influence that Link had on the scores of wanna be geetar heros & these 2 way cool sets drive that point home."
5,Nice flavor,I enjoy flavored coffees but don't want the sweetness of the syrup flavorings. These work well and give me a choice.
5,These authors/artists rock,"I love these guys...the particular copy that I got from amazon had been stolen from a library, but the read was still good and imagine the late fees that the poor sap who sold it to me will have har har har. Seriously, its a good series and you should read it, but don't buy over 10 until I do."
2,"Be Aware, A LOT smaller than expected",The unit has about a 3 foot range. Not the expected 20 foot as marked on the box. Be aware. Returned the product in hopes of getting one with longer range.
2,Good if you need short range,"I agree with the other reviewer - the range is low. I'd give it about 5 feet at high strength.However to illuminate a small room for a webcam, for example, it works ok.The box for the product suggests that there are other versions with man more LEDs. If you want 30 ft range you'll definitely want one of the more suped up versions."
1,Had to return it,"I had high hopes for this infrared light. However, it came with a broken stand. No matter, I decided to try it anyway. It didn't give off enough light for my camera to pick up. So I ended up returning it."
5,perfect,Looked just like the photo and works well. Happy with this product. Would buy it again if I needed a another one
5,well made bag,"Nice bag. A little big for my Nikon 8100 cool-pix but I was glad there was extra room for a few accessories.......extra battery, plug in cord, memory cards. The interior is yellow so you can see everything inside of it easily. Has a belt loop on the back or you can use the adjustable shoulder strap that comes with it. Extra mesh pockets inside to keep things separated. zip pouch on the outside to hold even more stuff. I would recommend this.....well made."
1,This bag is TINY!!!!,"I was really disappointed in how small this case is. My camera won't even fit into it. It might hold a flip camera and a couple of batteries. For me it's so small that it is useless. It would cost more to return it than I paid for it, so I'll just throw it away."
4,Almost perfect,"This book presents a great collection of songs for the soprano singer, ranging in the well-known to the semi-obscure, which is helpful for audition pieces. The only flaw is the lack of up-tempo numbers, as many of the songs are ballads and otherwise slow, which is a drawback for those trying to build up their range of styles."
5,Singers Anthology: vol. 1,This book has a very good assortment of tunes that are well known as well as some lesser known. Very singable for both sopranos and altos. Good accompaniments also.I highly recommend this book for all singers.
5,Very Fun Game,"For those of you who like the fast, shoot 'em up style video game, this may not be for you. This game can be very challenging and requires a strategic thought process to progress. There are many ways to play the game and different difficulty levels to play on. A little frustrating at first, but when you get the controls down, it's on."
5,One of the Best PS2 games!!,"If you have played contracts or silent assassin and you liked them-then you will LOVE Hitman: Blood Money. You will notice the improvements of the controls and gameplay. The graphics are pretty sweet and the controls are easier to work with. As far as gameplay, the player can be super stealthy or ""trigger happy"" to complete the mission(or somewhere in between). There are soooo many ways to complete a mission which makes the replay value very high. Also, thelevels and missions are so diverse. I could go on about this game but it is definitely worth the money.^_^"
2,It's no Silent Assassin,"""Hitman 2"" was one of the best PS2 games ever, so when I bought Contracts and found it to be a poorly made quicky sequel out only to snatch my $50 bucks, I hoped the developers would go back to the drawing board and come up with something on par with Silent Assassin.No such luck: Above all, Blood Money is silly and incredibly boring. No spoiler, but one mission takes place in the White House. Right, no trouble sneaking in there.The rest of missions don't follow any real story like HM2 but use the choppy action sequence approach that, unlike Contracts, aren't even entertaining. When I found myself chasing people dressed like birds I knew the game was in trouble.And finally, the end is the worst ever, on par with, ""It was all just a dream!"" Save your money."
2,"Bland, Bland, Blandity-Bland","The heroine is a paragon of virtue and the hero a model of manliness. The potential villain and villainess present no real threat. In fact, there are not really any obstacles to prevent the happily-ever-after ending. Where's the conflict? I don't need drama and fireworks, but I do need something to intrigue me.There's not much dialogue, but plenty of descriptions: a lot of coffee-making, shower-taking (and not the naughty kind), and hair- and teeth-brushing... these are clean people.And the love scenes seem really clinical - parts are anatomically named and tossed on the page as if the author had a list of them to get through.In short, this book left me wanting more, especially in terms of plot."
1,NOT what I thought it was,"I thought this was a book by Ozzy Osbourne. It is really just a collection of song lyrics with printed music. If you are a musician who wants to know the notes and lyrics to 14 Ozzy songs, then this book is for you. If you are expecting something like an autobiography, this isn't it!"
3,Who transcribed this?,"I bought this book from guitar center, mainly because I love Ozzy Osbourne & Randy Rhoads, and am constantly searching online for 100% correct tabs for alot of the songs and have found many, many, many just plain wrong ones.Well, as another reviewer mentioned...this book is wrong.Its advertised as 100% correct transcriptions from the albums, and thats not what is in print.Alot of these are close, and the solos are usually 100% right, but most of the rhythem sections are seriously wrong.It looks like some of Randys moves werent figured out and random notes were thrown in place of a proper chord or etc.Its funny because I can take the tab and put it into guitar-pro on the computer (it plays tabs as typed in) and sync up the actuall song, and parts of the song will be missed, wrong, etc..When you hear a chord, and the tab shows a sequence of 9-9-9-9-9 notes in place, you know somethings up.this book isnt 100% right, and if thats what you want, try a different tab book."
3,only for the most devout pumpkinhead fan,"i'd not be able to call myself a horror fan if i didnt enjoy pumpkinhead, but, and without running the risk of losing my horror fan status, this one is not very good. the special effects are really bad, especially in comparison to the original that worked with much less. the story is annoying, etc. ok for a rental, but don't complain about losing 2 hours of your life."
4,This has the right feel...,"After PUMPKINHEAD 3, I wasn't sure what to expect. And, there are rough edges to this new offering. But, the ghost of Ed Harley--Lance Henriksen--made this new film come alive for me. There are several scenes with Henriksen that remind all of us of two things: 1) the depth Lance has an actor; and 2) his ability to underscore again and again the deadend of revenge. If you care about horror as a genre of moral fable, then you should see this. Lance, thanks again!"
2,PumpkinHead 4 should have stopped at 1,"Silly plot. Horrible tie to first movie. Goes on and on with same premise of kill the one who calls the monster, but takes for ever to do it. Do not waste your money."
1,This book must be a joke!,"I couldn't get more than 16 pages into it - and that took several hours! The aliens go on about what their stomachs tell them to do. Apparently, the stomachs are brains - which has to be the most worthless device I've ever seen. This dude has NO idea how to write english - misplaced modifiers abound. There's nothing else to say abou this book. Try a decent book about hunting, like ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" or ""The Great Hunt."""
3,Alien/Human hunter symbiosis,"Most Science Fiction writers try to find a 'new' alien perspective and this certainly qualified for different. Biggest problem with the writing is that blundering about in fear constantly does NOT make for compelling reading. Secondly, having plot characters suddenly evolve to greater and greater power is kind of punkish. Is a brain without memory inside a metal mechanism a cyborg or is this a plot twist for the follow-up book? Galactic hunting and journalism seem trivial as the basis for characterization. Saving grace was the 'sybil' creature which reminded me of the greatness of Kenneth Bulmer's ""The Million Year Hunt"", though the 'sybil' was an antithesis it still was much too weak to save the story. Read ""Sleeping Planet"" for a 5 star story by this author. Thanks, Harry!"
2,Burkett's writing style leaves a lot to be desired,"I am not sure if I read the same book as everyone else here, but I found Burkett's writing syle to be very difficult to enjoy. The premise of the book is interesting and could have made for a powerful story if it did not seem like this book was written with Thesaurus in hand. Additionally, I think Burkett was trying to find the most bizarre sentence construction possible with every line he wrote. Granted, the chapters written from the greer's point-of-view should contain an alien element to their thinking, but not to the point of taking away from reader's enjoyment. I read sci-fi almost exclusively to the tune of 3-4 books per month. This one sat on my nightstand for well over a month because I just couldn't deal with more than a chapter at a time."
1,I Want Out,"Poor writing/editing, confusing story, dull everything else. I truly hated this book. I vowed to never write a review without finishing a book, and finishing this one nearly drove me insane."
2,Good drive while it lasted,"I bought this drive about 5 months ago. Just this week it stop recognizing original CDs and CD-rs. When I try to burn a CDr in Nero, Nero spits it out and says insert a blank CD. Tried every different brand, updated the firmware, and finally called Sony to RMA the drive. I spent over 2 hours on the phones with techs who have gone over every single thing I've already done before giving me an RMA number. It's been a nightmare and I wouldn't buy another Sony product because of the poor quality and bad service."
1,This drive is defective don't buy!!!,This is a defective drive. I was able to burn a couple of disks and then it stopped working. I have checked discussion boards and there are hundreds of entries on this drive with the same problem. It will not read any disks and is now useless. I had a lot of faith in Sony products until now. I think since they are out sourcing to China the qualllity of there products have dropped significantly. I just wanted to warn you all before you bought this bad product and that you should check for yourselves. This deserves a less than a 1 star rating!!!
1,terrible service,"i place this order on august 26, a sony dvd writer and i have not recive it yet, i wonder what happen???????????????????????????????????? i already contact the seller and they dont reply my e-mail, whats going on amazon? i always trust you!"
1,Sony DVD Writer - NO Mail and rebate,The product may be good. i dont know who offered the rebate.but they didnt keep up their word. i got the writer in late May or early June and still i have not got my rebate. Im dissappointed. i would say i lost $60.
2,Memorex 8X media users BEWARE!,"I am using both the -Rs and +Rs and have experienced some discs that skip in the middle and some that skip at the end when played back in various set top players...Never had this problem with my old Pioneer 8X burner and TDK/Ritek discs...I am now ditching this drive and going with Memorex's own Dual Layer DVD writer... I would hope that the same manufacturer's drive and media would be 100% compatible, but in this crazy, mixed up technology world, I am not so sure..."
1,The drive is bad but dealing with Sony is worse!,"This drive started acting flakey shortly after I installed it. Would not reliably read or write CD's properly. A lot of errors verifying, etc. I have a HP drive mounted directly under this one which works fine. Understandably you get a lemon once in a while so since it is under warrenty I got on the phone with Sony. This is where the real trouble started. It is now 2 hours and 4 telephone numbers later and I am still trying to get this resolved as I write this. I am pretty sure this will be the last piece of Sony hardware I will be buying."
1,Won't buy another Sony drive......,The drive just gone dead on me and would not burn any disc after about 11 month of infrequent use. Had spend the extra money to get the Sony brand but am totally disappointed. Will be staying away from Sony drives going forward.
1,NOT A GOOD DVD/CD REWRITABLE DRIVE,"I PURCHASED THIS UNIT IN JANUARY 2005. BY JUNE 2006 (just 6 months after the warranty EXPIRED) IT WOULD NOT READ DVDs, called SONY Technical Support, they just wasted my time. I just changed it out with a NEC ND-3550A."
2,Don't bother with Sony drives,"My drive like this stopped working in about 15 days. Which makes you wonder if I just got a dud. (Most likely) But then I start thinking about it and I have had 2 previous single layer models. Both of those died in 2 completely different computers over the span of 3 months each. One of which was a store replacement for the other. But 3 sony drives on 2 different computers, all dead. This new one was in a spanking new system I just built with it. Now I have 2 Plextor Dual Layer DVD burners in both of those systems and they have worked flawlessly ever sense.I would suggest you stay away from Sony drives. Get anything else. Doesn't have to be what I have. I think anything else should do. (but I understand Sony drives are often just remarked LightOn's. Something to think about.) I'm 3 for 3 on Sony and 0 for 2 using other brands. Seems like a pretty lousy gamble buying Sony DVD burners to me."
1,stopped doing +Rs after six months,"This drive worked perfectly for about 6 months, at which time it suddenly lost the ability to burn anything properly in DVD+R format. Every single DVD+R format disc I now burn has serious pixelation and freezing problems (oddly, this doesn't happen with DVD-Rs). I wasted about an hour waiting for and dealing with Sony customer service, only to have the rep tell me that the first four brands of blank media I rattled off were ""inferior."" When I asked him which ones were NOT inferior, the list he gave me included one brand that I had also had recent problems with (and didn't mention at first). Basically, Sony has made an inferior product that does not withstand the test of time, and is now trying to weasel its way out of a one-year warranty. I will not buy another Sony product if I have a choice."
1,"Even if you want to like it, you won't","As many other reviewers have said, this book doesn't seem to have actually been written by Clarke - if it had, it wouldn't be the steaming pile of poo that it is. Rendezvous with Rama was good if not great - but everything that made it thought-provoking has been abandoned in this sequel. I kept reading thinking that somehow it had to get better, because it couldn't get much worse. But then it did....Even for free, it's not worth it."
1,Gentry Lee sours Clarke,"While the first novel (Rendezvous with Rama) was admittedly populated by two dimensional characters, it was nevertheless a great read. The focus of the story was where it should have been-- on the mysterious, awe-inspiring space craft code-named Rama. This grotesque sequel, however, seems to place the focus on a group of characters you wouldn't want to spend so much as an evening with. Rancid soap opera almost totally obscures whatever imagination and wonder remained from the first novel."
1,Sci Fi embarrassment,"Reading this novel made me feel embarrassed -- it felt like Rama II was written by a high school freshman, so obviously wanting to sound mature and sophisticated. The novel also reminded me of some of the worst Hollywood action movies. Sorry Arthur Clarke, this was one of the worst books I've looked at to my memory, so laughable, so pathetic."
1,Sure fire cure for insomnia,Trouble sleeping? Just read Rama II or any of the follow on sequels. Any one of then is guaranteed to bore you into a blissful slumber within minutes.
3,ehhhhh.,"I must admit, Rendevouz with Rama blew me away. It got me so hooked i went out and bought all of them. I've just finished Rama II to my disappointment. I can understand having some character background and a villain here and there. But Gentry Lee just over did it. What happend to the science fiction? Gentry...take the drama out of Rama and stick to what made it great. Solid science fiction. Something to stimulate the imagination and minds of all us sci-fi lovers."
2,A book that goes no where,"A plot line that wanders with no place to go. It seems the authors sat down at the word processor without an outline or any idea where or what their characters were going to do.. If your going to read it, check it out of the library"
2,pointless,"This was the most pointless book Ive ever read. There is no reason for this novel what so ever. The intrigue and mystery from the first book is no where to be found here and yet the story goes on and on. How can a sequal be double the size of the original anyway? I'll tell you, poor writing and no structure. The whole story seems to be made up as it goes along. There are so many chapters in this book you dont even need to read. I never thought Id come across a poor Clarke novel but Im sure it's not all on his shoulders. There are some pretty interesting things in this book but none of it makes for a better overall book. If you need to read this go right ahead, just dont expect another gem (but maybe a plastic pearl)."
3,ruining a great concept for commercial gain,"It is sad that Clarke is cashing in on the wonderful, self-contained creations that were his and only his. Now he has a co-author, whom I suspect does most of the work, and then tries to sell these knock-offs by the power of his name. In the process, he does much to ruin the original concepts.This books brings Rama back, with the promise of explaining what was left the most pregnant mysery at the end of the first book. He did the same with the Space Odyssey series, though those eforts are far better because there is more of his mind in them. This book is not without merit: there are good characters in it, idealism is matched by an equally powerful cynicism, and the story is relatively fun. But there is no question that it lacks the spirit of the first tome. The mission goes awry this time, with interesting consequences and some potential for the later books.Get it only if you can bear disappintment and yet must see where they will take it."
1,chris says,lousy sequel to great original Rendezvous with Rama. contaminated with pc by bimbo co-author. same goes for sequel 3.
2,"Bad, bad, bad, bad ,bad","Please, do not waste your time. I love Author Clark but this book is incredibly bad and the characters are totally unbelievable. I could give you may examples but it gives me a headache just thinking about it. Read the reviews on Rama Revealed for more bad reviews."
5,I loved the novel,"I am surprised that this novel got such unpopular ratings. It is different than the original, but I found the cast of characters compelling. There are a hodgepodge of people who won the honour of being part of the second Rama exploration team. There was an Italian seductress who uses sex to get anything she wants, a super brilliant scientist, a Japanese doctor, a devotedly Christian military officer, and so on. You also have two alien races in the octospiders and the avians. The politics of struggling between each other (and the governments and religions of Earth giving orders behind the scenes) coupled with the exploration of the alien environment really made this a page-turner for me.I would agree that the third (The Garden of Rama) and fourth (Rama Revealed) novels are awful though. Very boring and a lot of interesting characters and storyline gone. But this one was very good."
1,Low quality keyboard,Why do the donuts fly in Rama...What is the meaning of the shoelaces? It is all very vagueWhy do the novels mentioned in the novel actually relate to situations not in the novel
4,GOOD.....but not the best.,"RamaII was extremly original but lacked in reality. The sf in this book was great and kept giving you more questions than answers. I would have given it a 10 or 9 but the characterizations were lame. There were to many coinincidences. I love almost all of the Rama books, but this one was a little contrived."
4,Wasn't necessary,"Rendezvous with Rama was an original, thought provoking work. The sequel only seems to have been written to satisfy the demand for such, but does little else. Though the stories are quite similar, the adjustments made to the story offer little new. That's not to say it's bad. I just think Clarke and Lee could have gone from Rendezvous with Rama to Rama II with few changes"
2,It took 200 pages before the Science Fiction began in this book. UGH,"You can tell that this was not an Arthur C. Clarke original. Whomever this Gentry Lee is... is a total waste of time!THe original boo, Rendezvous with Rama was a fast paced book. It was an excellent adventure with a twist at the end, at least in my opinion.And book 1 was a stand alone book. You could read it and be done and be all the better for it!This book... UGH.... 200 pages before the science fiction actually started. blah.I'm so disappointed. And even then, the ending was not all that great.Just not impressed.Just turn to page 200 and start there.Disappointing. I would NOT recommend this book."
2,Reads like a '70s disaster movie,"*The plucky black female single mom*The brilliant but angry scientist*The beautiful, get-the-interview-at-all-costs journalist*and moreagainst the backdrop of the second space craft of the mysterious Ramans.Yeah, the spaceship is merely a backdrop to this soap opera mess.I got to page 99 of this mess about a bunch of drama queens before they even took off into space. I finally put the book down at that point.Read ""Rendezvous with Rama"" then stop. Do not try to read this mess."
2,Disappointing,"The book suffers from a lack of application on behalf of the authors. Many scenarios are not plausible and read like a mystery novel. The cavalier manner in which the journey is planned and executed is unreal. Things cannnot be happening in such style even in current expeditions. The expedition looks like a wild-west excursion, the doctor having to rely on memory for doing healthchecks, the lack of a chain of command, decision that would definitely have been taken on ground being taken in space etc. ... The story is dragged too long and the hallucinations of Nicole and the psycho-stuff grind the pace of the novel down."
4,As real as the Rendevous with Rama...,"First and foremost, this Rama is discovered 70 years after the first one AND after global economic depression on Earth. The same utopian and wide-eyed explorer mentality is lossed due to tragic global events on Earth. Humanity isn't the same. Humanity has reverted back to an earlier time (some could argue our current time). That is why this book is so great. It takes a flawed group of humans into a scientific marvel. A marvel that raises age-old human questions. In my opinion, many people just don't like the gritty humanity of Rama II. I enjoyed both the gritty humanity and the wonderful science. No warp speed here. Just pure science with lots of humanity. I highly recommend."
1,"Whatever happened to ""Rendezvous with Rama""?","The Rama sequels were a major disappointment for me after reading a masterwork such as ""Rendesvouz with Rama"". Their crawling pace is unforgivable, and it is due to the various lenghthy irrelevant personal dramas which take valueble space in the story. When one is eagerly waiting to find out the truth about mysterious aliens, it is a torment to be confronted with hundreds of wasted pages. I believe the three Rama sequels should be edited, with whole chapters being wiped out. The odds are, nobody would miss them."
2,Perhaps better as a computer game than a book.,"I couldn't put this book down. But its not what you may think. I wanted to keep reading to see if the plot was getting somewehere. It didn't and was I relieved when I finished it.This is not typical A.C. Clark. The story rambled on and on, with excessive detail of the interior of the Rama ship. There were too many characters to hate and too many meaningless deaths. I think contrived is the word I would use to best describe the main and sub-plots. Was it truly necessary to make the media representative so vulgar and unscrupulous? I think not.When I started to read the story I was sure that it was going to answer some of the imponderable questions left by the first book. It didn't, and by the end it simply left more questions (do I see a Rama III in the offing?).I suggest a sad pass on this tale."
4,Not as bad as I was led to believe.,"The book takes a while to get going, introducing us to ridiculous characters (I'm looking at you, Francesca Sabatini). But once it gets going, I felt like I was reading the first book again. I felt like I was on Rama with the characters. There isn't much in terms of plot advancement, but we do get to meet new creatures and see them do things the others in the first book didn't do. I loved revisiting New York, the city-like area on the ship. If you can get past the over-developed characters, there is some fun and intrigue to be found."
2,Disapointing,"Too much soap opera, not enough science fiction. Too much Gentry Lee, not enough Arthur C. Clarke! It was a real chore to get through the book."
2,"Radically different than the first, and not in a good way.","After loving the first Rama book I got this immediately, hoping for further exploration of interesting sci-fi ideas. Instead, much of this book was devoted thinly developed characters who I did not care about in the least. I'd say if you loved the first, skip this one."
2,Ignore this book...,"A good science fiction book should have you wanting to read it. You would not want to put it down, waiting to know what would happen next. This book seemed to drag on. Everything that I found interesting in the first book was not there. Instead there was nothing but a small but slightly interesting shell of a story wrapped up in a soap opera like atmosphere. It also has an obsession with sex that I can not explain. (but it gets A LOT worse in the third book) The series goes downhill geometricly after this one so dont bother."
3,Good but Rendevous with Rama was much more imaginative.,"If your looking for a sequel that captures your imagination the way Rendevous with Rama did, then this book will let you down a tad. Although both are good books in and of themselves, I was a bit disappointed when I read Rama II. It didn't have the same fervor of imagination present in Rendevous with Rama... Gentry Lee does great in developing characters but fails somewhat, in my opinion, in developing a good sequel that picks up where the last book left off."
2,A dissapointing sequel.,"When I got this book as a gift(one I requested) I dived right in, expecting Clarke to write another mysterious tale of alien intelligence. I was dissapointed from the first page. The text(which I suspect is Lee's) is the same boring drown of many a sleepy story. I was confused by the visions of des Jardins, they had no point. And the worst was the cliff hanger at the end. It screamed BUY MY SEQUEL! I wish I had stayed on the first book."
4,I thought it was pretty good.,"It may not have been quite as ""exciting"" as Rendevous with Rama, it certainly was more detailed. There was much more character development, including the ""biots.""I will say that there was more background then may have been necessary. It made Rendevous with Rama seem like a prequel to Rama II. I liked Rendevous better, but all in all, Rama II was enjoyable."
1,is it really by Clarke?,"I read the first chapter of Rama II, and it became immediately obvious to me that Clarke didn't write it. Instead of introducing any science-fiction ideas, it is a propaganda piece about the author's views on economics (government spending will ruin the economy) and abortion (it's good for holding down the population of minority groups). It sounded like something by an Ayn Rand disciple, which Clarke definitely isn't. Either Clarke did not write the novel, or he cared so little about the book that he delegated the crucial first chapter to his collaborator. Either way I decided it wasn't worthwhile reading the rest.This is the first time I've felt justified writing a review on the basis of one chapter."
1,Too much lead-in with no relevance!!!,"I read Rendezvous with Rama, and then I immediately jumped into Rama II. The first thing I noticed was that Gentry Lee writes and elaborates a lot more than Arthur C. Clark. Also, he spends way too long on trying to develop stupid, simpleminded characters while barely spending any time on the PLOT. Unfortunately, I read onward. Some of the book was interesting, but no thought was given to the facts that perspective changed and so did the view of Rama. The plot goes more and more downhill, and the end parts were really stupid. Although this book stunk, I won't spoil the end. I will just say that the next book is worse."
1,ACC and Gentry Lee,The brilliant imaginative ideas of Clarke are completely overshadowed by the fantastically boring writing of Lee.If you're an ACC fan - - don't bother!
1,"""Sir Arthur C. Clarke's"" Rama II","There is a reason the ""author's"" name is in quotation marks. This book is probably 10% (or less) Clarke and 90% his co-author. It is bad. Lots of personal melodrama amongst the characters that is totally out of place in Sir Artuhr's classic work. I loved Rama, hated Rama II. Recycled it a quarter of the way through. I will not be continuing with the Rama series. Be warned."
2,A soap opera in outer space!,"It's sad to see how the marvellous story started by Clarke's ""Rendezvous with Rama"" gets spoiled by the most unbelievable characters and their long-winded personal histories totally irrelevant to the plot. And anyway, as another reviewer has sensibly asked, who on earth chose such a crew of lunatics for such an important mission? Most of the happenings inside Rama II are totally unrealistic.Rama II is hard to read through and rarely gets down to the point, namely, the Raman spaceship and its inhabitants. Be prepared to skip pages, especially those about Nicole's preposterous dreams.If I made it until the end it's because, after Clarke's Rendezvous, I can't get off the Raman story any more and I want to know how the story goes on and ends. However, as I have been warned, I might be in for two more books of cosmic soap opera that's hard to digest."
1,What a mistake...,"It's tough to accuse Mr. Clarke of characterization. Despite his huge cannon, even works like 2001 and 2010 render characters on the whole rather flat.But this isn't a criticism. Clarke is about imagination, and science applied to futuristic vision. And, along with Asimov, at this he is a master.So, Rendezvous with Rama, is a work of pure imagination. A 'what if'. Hard science re-engineered to an alien world. Rama II on the other hand is a different beast.Who told Gentry Lee that importing stock cardboard characters, tired cliche plot elements and possibly the worst dialogue ever committed to paper would improve upon the Rama experiance? I think we should be told.I approach the rest of the series with a certain sense of dread."
1,Bad and boring.,This book is a mess. If you read RAMA you should avoid this book. Gentry Lee has the skill of a third rate romance writer. He plops in all the drama of a TV soap opera with abandon. How much did Arthur Clarke had to do with this? Who can say but not much since all that made RAMA such a good and interesting book is gone. Silly one dimensional people populate the book and keep doing cringe worthy things thorough. They would seem to be more at home on a NBC movie of the week then in a book like this. I was disappointed that someone could take a simple and classic book like RAMA and mess it up so badly. A shame really.
1,Tried too hard,"After ""Rendezvous"" this cannot even compare. Too many attempts at a diverse crew and pleasing the political slant of the time. Maybe even too much Gentry Lee."
1,Terrible! Boring!!!!!,"This book commits the unpardonable crime of being excruciatingly boring. The characters are painfully wooden. The writing is absolutely dreadful. I have read better stuff written by 5th graders. How Lee Gentry (and make no mistake, this book was written by HIM) ever became an author is beyond my comprehension. He should be ashamed."
1,Sigh,The book was not as entertaining or engaging as I expected it to be. I like the speculation about alien technology and culture. I do not like reading about back stabbing asshats in space unless there are pirates involved - no not metaphorical pirates - REAL pirates. Space pirates. That was a good movie. It had a sense of humor: Space herpes. Now THAT is funny! Nothing about this book was remotely funny. The little Shakespearean robots could have a been comedic gold mine.Steal this book and then don't read it. You may prevent someone else from accidentally reading it thinking that it would be a good sequel to its predecessor. Not a chance.Great cover art though!
1,"Soap opera pettiness, with a science fiction backdrop","Giving a 1 star review might seem extreme, but this book deserves it. I think I was on page 120 when I threw this book across the room in frustration, as they had not even left planet earth yet in the midst of a soap opera drama. This book is NOT Rama, not in anyway shape or form. The first 120 pages are an exercise in pettiness between competing people to get on the ship to meet Rama. Essentially its Beverly Hills 90210 triteness, with a science fiction backdrop. I could go on and on, but there is limited time to read all the great books out there and this one has taken up too much of my time already."
4,An adventure the size of Rama.,"It is true that a rather large portion of Rama II deals in building a picture of the crew destined to meet with Rama. This at first might discourage some readers who wish to jump the gun and get to the action as quickly as possible, but it's a necessary ingredient in a strong novel. Rama II is a wonderful adventure where one boards an alien vessel and explores a mysterious world of extraterrestrial wonders and science. I thoroughly recommend it"
4,A weaker. . .,". . .yet still enjoyable book based on the scenario presented in ""Rendevouz with Rama"".Another ""Rama"" style spacecraft has been sighted. A manned mission, with 12 members from various nations and walks of life, meets the craft. Much of the book deals with the reactions the various crewmembers have toward the ship -- and with the interpersonal relationships on board. There is quite a bit of religious and philosophical speculation which some readers will find off-putting. Clarke and Lee ask some interesting questions, but really don't seem to have the theological background to pull them off.The book is designed to be the first of three, and thus the irritation of the rather abrupt ending is somewhat mitigated.3 1/2 stars, rounded up, because I was entertained -- not because of any brilliance."
2,It could have been better...,"After the first Rama novel, this one was quite dissapointing. It could just be that Clarke needs to find a new theme other than large black monoliths."
2,Rama goes from interesting subject to soap opera backdrop!,"RWR is one of my favourite books, Rama II was a huge dissapointment. As opposed to being the amazing and mind expanding subject, it became the backdrop for a very ordinary soap opera."
3,"(thud, snore)","I thought this was a great book! I have a sleep disorder, and it put me right to sleep! The only good thing about the last three books in the series IS NOT THIS BOOK (it's the last one, where I think ACC put his foot down or something)! I think that they should stick Gentry Lee in his Galileo spacecraft and launch it inside the orbit of Venus. The characters were pretty good, but I think that that was because I had played the game (way better than the book) and had learned more about them than I could have in the novel (I was reading in Richard's voice)."
3,Nice sequel to the splendid first Rama,There is a little bit a sense of wonder again. But I hate the parts of Gentry Lee (too much Soap Opera-like). Better than 'Cradle' and 'Rama III' and 'Rama IV'.
3,Rama 2 too long....,"Rama 2 is an ok book, but Arthur C. Clarke should have tried to make a long story short, instead of the opposite which he did. I think the Rama series of books are good, but none of the books can stand alone, except for the first one. In a series like this if there are cliffhangers it makes them awful and tedious to read. The cliffhanger at the end of Rama 2 was one of the most pathetic ways of saying, ""Hey, nothing has been resolved, so buy my next book."" I do think that the characters were great in this novel. I am also wondering what ever happened to Arthur C. Clarke's novels that had great ideas about the future and the awesome potential that mankind has. It angers me that Clarke would sink to using some sort of economic apocalypse to provide a future story without any advandements in tecnology from the first novel. Maybe it can be blamed on Gentry Lee, who knows?"
2,Disappointing,"I agree with Music Matt, and I would go further. I don't understand this book's popularity and many editions--maybe it used to be assigned for college courses, but I was not impressed. Everything he says is obvious to anyone who has made any attempt at composition, taken harmony or counterpoint, and certainly anyone with enough background to read the 290 examples. He states the obvious and then belabors it at length. I'm donating mine to the library's book sale."
2,good but could be better,Let me start by saying that this case for the i pod mini has its pros and cons. it protects the ipod mini and has a perfect fit. but to much hassle with opening the case to function the wheel. of the it should have been removed another major problem with this case is that the belt clip is made very poorly. and does not come close the original case that the i pod mini comes with. its to thin and looks like it will break and further more its does not have a swivel clip. the way most cell phones have. will there ever be a perfect case i havent seen one yet.
2,Just not comfortable...doesn't fit well?,"The shoe is too ""deep"", so one would have to have a fat foot for it to fit well. If you have thick feet, then this shoe might fit?"
2,two and one half stars - not comfortable,"I found the leather to be not soft, and ""cardboardy"". Narrow - not medium"
1,Defective out of the box,"This is the first Maxxis product I've ever bought. Upon receiving, I opened the box and inflated the tube to test it. I immediately heard air escaping.....geez. It didn't take long to find two perfectly matching holes on either side of the seam, located on the inside of the tube. Looks like a manufacturing defect."
1,Not anymore they don't!!!,"Description quote: ""Fish hook gullet design removes chips more effectively; extremely sharp, curved carbide teeth eliminate tooth drag for a smoother, faster cut."".Yeah, that's what they USED to correctly claim. NO longer, however. Gone are the Black & Decker proprietary curved ""Piranha"" carbide blade tips. As such they were hands down the best blades on the market..B&D; Piranha blades now have small, STRAIGHT carbide tips, yet they still bear the ""Piranha"" name on the blade, but are nothing more than an ordinary Chinese blades, the likes of which can be acquired at any flea market or where cheap blades are sold..Sadly, the original Piranha blades were truly a superior blade and a B&D; exclusive. They have now evolved into an ordinary cheaply made blade widely available anywhere cheap blades are sold."
3,"good show, not so good quality dvd","There is no way you can compare a Cirque du Soleil live show and one on DVD, so I cannot say anything critical about the content of this video. If you have ever seen a show live, you know that there is far too much going on at one time for a camera to take in, and that the music and acts can only be truly appreciated when heard and seen in person. However, the quality of the sound and picture of this DVD is a really big letdown. I have seen Varekai on DVD and the colors are vibrant, the sound clear and wonderful. La Nouba looks like someone filmed it with a camcorder. The colors are dull, the picture fuzzy, and the sound less than impressive. I am thoroughly disappointed. I'm not particularly picky about picture & sound quality (I don't expect everything to be state of the art) but this is just not good. Unless maybe I just got a bad DVD (is that possible?), this is not really what it should be."
5,The entire family loved it,"We bought La Nouba because the 8 year had seen it in school and kept begging us to buy it. It's a great show, combining fresh takes on traditional circus fare (clowns, trapeze artists, acrobats, and tightrope walkers) and completely different and unexpected talent exhibitions. It's done with the stunning Cirque du Soleil visual dazzlement one comes to expect. The 4 and 8 year olds keep watching it over and over."
2,okay,"i would have prefered if the image was a bit more clear, it would have been much better in digital or high definition."
3,"Great performance, poor video quality","The performances were excellent (of course) but the quality of the video just isn't up to Cirque standards. It's worth buying, but a little more video tweaking before releasing it would have made it look much better."
4,Cirque du Soleil - La Nouba,I watched the live show and the DVD helped me see things you can't see at the show. The dvd is awesome I watch it over and over
3,A great memory....,For any Cirque fan that has seen this show it is a great way to keep the memory of it alive...My biggest complaint about the filming is once again they go over the top with too many creative camera shots and cuts in editing....
5,Great DVD,I bought this for my grand children as it is the one performed at Disney. It was wonderful on a long trip as it really held their attention.If you have the opportunity to see one of the Cirque du Soleil shows live be sure to do it and then buy a DVD so you can relive the excitement.
5,Great Show..Must see,This is an incredible fascinating acrobatics show. Should see the live performance in Orlando and also get this DVD to continue having fun for ages.
1,Buyers Beware!,"Re: 1074211This price ($16.75) is the price of ONE plate! I thought I ordered 2 sets of 4, but I received 2 plates for $33.50. Not a good price."
1,Beware this is a single plate,Visit a corningware store near you or order online. This is one single plate and it retails for less than $3-$4 a piece. I have no clue how it is overpriced to this extent. Please be careful while ordering this.
5,Love Corelle Livingware,I love that the color on these plates is vivid. The black is REALLY black. Would definitely purchase again.
1,dissapointing,"This book is a big disappointment. It's a rehash of psychic research that has been discussed before by better writers. The rub is that these two writers throw in claims about spirituality and healing. Targ claims he was miraculously cured of cancer, but dodges the question of whether he was sick or just misdiagnosed. That offends those of us who have the disease and are dealing with it, not exploiting it. Misdiagnosis is a common problem and ""miracle cures"" are often the result of proper re-testing. I want proof of miraculous healing, not a silly claim that a little jogging and a little prayer equals a miracle. The authors imply that only those who are not spiritual get sick and die. Katra says she's a healer, but her not very original new age ideas amount to trite advice to think positive. How spiritual is it to exploit sick people by holding out false hope and claims of miracles to sell a book? Look for God and truth elsewhere. One star because there is no lower rating.Andrea Hope"
3,Fair,"The book seemed somewhat disjointed and I found it quite boring in spots. Even so there is some good, interesting stuff so i would recommend a reader to keep plodding along in this book to get at the meaty stuff!"
1,"right guy, wrong interpretation","The authors are correct in pointing out that many sick people sought outJoel Goldsmith in his day and indeed were healed, though he'd be the first to admit that ""God is only the healer"" however,I must in good conscience caution readers not to assign much weight to the authors' interpretation of the great man's words, for they would need be a great deal nearer to Goldsmith's spiritual level to even begin to understand him."
2,"good, but there are alternatives","PROS-great to start as finger foods (easier than cheerios to pick up and eat)-dissolves quickly (less of a choking hazard)-baby loves them!CONS-stains! As the baby drools on his hands or loses a half-eaten puff, it leaves a bright orange stain on clothing, rugs, etc. Not easy to get out, and a lot of the other flavors are more neutral colored and do not stain as much as the sweet potato. The last thing I want to do is have to wash his highchair cover and straps, rugs, clothes, etc because of bright orange stains all around.-cheaper versions available (ie, at Target they have their own brands)-does have sugar (I wish they can make a low or non-sugar version, because I'm pretty sure the baby will still eat them. Why add unnecessary sugar into everything?)I started with the Gerber sweet potato, but I'll be sticking to the Target blueberry (because it's cheaper and doesn't stain)"
2,not my baby's favorite,"i should have tried this flavor before buying bulk here. my daughter loves puffs in general and she really liked the sweet potato ones we got before this one. but the apple cinnamon flavor is a little too 'artificial' and strong. instead of grabbing them by the handful, she doesn't seem too interested to eat these.."
3,convenient,"my toddler loves them,they are convenient,perfect for sitters house or on the go,and my boy likes all of them.walmart has them under 3 a canister i think.i usually get them there.my star review is based o how much sugar they have.i prefer to give my kid flavored cheerios,they have less sugar and better on price,they just don't melt in your mouth or come in a convenient can.besides the sugar and price,i love them.but i do pretty much use all of the gerber toddler stuff for on the go,and when i am home i try to use a different sub,like cereal,yogurt or what ever the mainproduct is for that specific gerber item.my dad and babysitter pretty much love to have these on hand for mess free convenience though."
3,Scrumptious little suckers but overpriced,"I got them at Wall-Mart for $1.83 a box. With subscribe & save would have cost me $2.38. Now, don't get me wrong, I love S&S, I signed up for a lot of things, but buyer beware, price is not as competitive as we're accostumed with S&S."
2,Stain clothing,"This is a good idea, and they dissolve quickly for babies new to food. But if a partially slobbered on one falls out of the baby's mouth and onto clothing it leaves a stain that proves impossible to remove. The puffs have a bit of an orange coating on them, it must contain food coloring. I've tried organic puffs and they don't leave any stains."
5,Wonderful product,"They taste great, even my 13 year old likes them.Easy to pick up, My 8 month old is learning to self feedDissolve quickly in the mouth, I like ALL of the Gerber puffs!"
5,Yummy!,My 2 year old and my 8 month old both love these. I wish there were more calories in these but they are yummy and perfect for toddlers learning to feed themselves. Dissolves very quickly. The sweet potato and peach flavour are my favorites. :)
1,It almost expire !,I place order on 25 June 12 . But this snack expire on 18 sep 12.I order about 200-300 bottle of Gerber Graduate!I got only 2 mounth and a bit left for this flavor!!!!!!!!!!!!Poor!!!!!!Why you do with your royal costumer like this.I pay you a lot every mounth!Bad sale.If it almost expire just keep it away or send it to the bin.Don't give it to me.Waste of money!
1,expiration date,It would be tremendously helpful to know the expiration dates of these food items... or is it written somewhere and i've missed it? thanks
5,Babies love these.,"I don't think I've come across a baby that doesn't like these. They're super easy to chew, even for babies with no teeth at all. The basically dissolve from the saliva in your mouth. I know this because I tried one before I gave it to my kids. They have a nice flavor too. Great first finger/practice food."
3,judas eyes,Not nearly as good as his other books in this series. I would also like to state that Leisure Books decision to usemicroscopic print did not help in my enjoyment of this book.
5,seminal work,"This is a seminal work on gesture, influencing all good gesture work that came after it."
3,What's with the face?,"The only real gripe I have with this wonderful piece, is the face. The detail? wonderful. Very feminine. Great legs. But the face... well...It's just flat. Nothing like the painting that inspired it."
2,Also Disappointed!,Like the last poster I also thought I was getting a padded harness like the photo indicates. What I got instead was nothing but a few webbing straps with no pleating or padding. I feel like I've been ripped off with this product and won't be using it on my dog anytime soon!!!Isn't this false advertising?? !!!!!
5,Bubba the Cowboy Prince,"My first grade class absolutely loves Bubba! They want me to talk like Miz Lurlene all the time...what a good Texas accent can do to entertain and keep kids on task! They know all the words by heart! When Miz Lurlene talks, they listen. I did not tell my students that it was a Cinderella take off, and one of my boys jumped up in the middle and shouted, ""Hey, this is like Cinderella!"" and now we all believe in the Fairy God Cow. Thanks, Helen Ketteman and James Warhola!"
5,Fantastic book! A real treat!,I bought this book for my 4 year preschool class after it was highly recommended by another teacher. I read this book for Circle Time - every child sat mesmerized. I ended up reading it twice that day and it has been requested several time since then. The story is cute and everyone got a giggle out of the Fairy Godcow!
4,Smaller than I expected,This is very nice quality but I expected it to be larger from the way it appeared in the picture. You can turn some small cutlets over in the pan but it didn't work well for fish fillets.
5,Possibly the best in its price range,"As of today, Jan. 21, 2004 Amazon is offering this product from three different merchants at three different prices with three different names. Possibly the confusion comes from the fact the the name of the product is partially in Italian, so every merchant made up its own name. Anyway, the following three are the same, just buy the cheapest1. Caffe in Grano 8.8 oz, Whole Bean -- Merchant: A.G. Ferrari Foods2. Illy Roasted Espresso Coffee Beans -- Merchant: Goodman's3. illy Whole Bean Espresso, Normale -- Merchant: CaffeSolo"
2,Personal preference,"I think coffee taste is more of a personal preference, but I was not fond of this decaf coffee. I always drink my coffee black and I didn't get the rich coffee taste that I like with the Don Francisco brand. Illy has a great reputation so I am guessing their non-decaf coffee is outstanding, they just need a little work with the decaf."
5,I love this thing,"I agree with the customers who have given it a 5 star rating. I like the sauce to be thin. I would say use a little less water to get a thicker consistency- or pour out some after cooking the mac.... Personally, I am not a fan of the Kraft Original Mac n Cheese because there is a powdery aftertaste consistency that sticks to teeth. However this one is so much smoother. At first I was surprised by the color being gray-yellow... but this does not affect the taste! I dont normally get full after eating just carbs but this one is pretty filling."
2,Valuation DCF Model,Be Careful! It is just a CD including an Excel File. You need to have two other add-ins installed to run the file. I can't judge how flexible this model is. But I couldn't apply this to my current valuation class in MBA program.
3,The book is good for subjective decision making.,"I have read a lot of books on how to value companies. This book has given me some more insight as to how to measure the intrinsic value of a company. However, the book at times is vague and esoteric. It is not altogether easy to read. Overall it is an all right book."
4,Practical and clear,"I am an MBA student in the midst of my summer internship trying to calculate the value of an international company. After borrowing this book from a coworker, I am ordering my own. It explains the material that my profesors were unable to impart to me this past year. I have never read a finance related book so clearly written and with plenty of examples to reinforce the concepts. Well organized, easy to read, easy to understand. Buy the book - skip the class!"
2,Basic introduction to the valuation,"The book covers just the basic concept of the valuation. It is useful for beginners who have no idea how valuation shall be done. However, it is far from practical for professionals."
1,User-unfriendliness at its best,"Hmm I wonder if those giving this book five stars actually work for McKinsey. As a practioner, I don't know anyone in the industry who has actually read this book. It looks impressive on the bookshelf, but the content is anything but impressive. A lot of topics are covered, but each one only superficially and the writing is extremely dry and boring. I actually found reading this volume *painful*, and I'm supposed to like this stuff since I do it for a living! My advice for any potential buyer is read a few chapters first before you shell out for it."
4,"Excellent book, but ""not for beginners"".","I want to say something about this book that the other reviewers didn't see. The point is that this book is a ""tecnical"" book and should not be considered as Carl Sagan's books an ""easy reading of something difficult for the common people"". This means that if you want to buy this book just to take a look of what valuation is, you are waisting your time and money: you shoul go firt to the university and study a little before you do this. So, considering only the purpose of this book I can say that it's contents are excellent, and the only drawback is that it is absolutely theoretical. It should have contained more excersises. But that's it...........excellent.!!!!!!"
1,Too focused on the DCF-Method,"According to the title and previous reviews, I expected a comprehensive guide featuring a critical overview on the current methods of valuation, the differences between them and, finally, a conclusion which method to use under which circumstances. However, the authors promote the DCF-method as the single approach, using their presentation and sales skills to badmouth anything else. If you want a book on DCF, this may be your choice, but don't expect a comprehensive guide."
1,Nothing spectacular,"Unfortunately, for all the name brand that this book conveys, I think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part. There are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as McKinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers mind. The subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session. No actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, I would be astounded. Save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation. By the way, those giving 5 stars either can't read English very well or are shills for McKinsey."
2,Good as a basic introduction to the subject,"The book focuses on the DCF method only. Additionally, it is not very clear introducing the concepts. Although it is a start for basic study, I would not recommend it for professional professional valuation work."
4,The No. 1 Book on DCF Valuation,I found Valuation to be far and away the best financial text book on DCF valuation techniques I've come across in 5 years as a security analyst.
2,This one is deep.,"Good treatment of the subject for specialists, but a book I like better is ""Unlocking the Value of Your Business"", which seems to produce the same bottom-line results, but faster and simpler."
1,Boring as hell,"Well, no one expects financial valuation book to be as catching as a suspense thriller but this book is ultimate in boring reading. I am currently pursuing my MBA and am not foreign to hard to read books. But more often than not I have been pleasantly surprised by how well books are written on topics like corporate finance and accounting. This book went straight to bottom of the heap on my shelf. Authors have made a difficult topic even more difficult. They would do well if they learn some writing skills. Then we can also talk about some financial valuation."
3,"The cover and paper quality, and graph color are not good","The book's content is rich and meaningful. But the quality of the paper is very low. Especially the cover paper is not durable. When you open and close the book, the cover paper cracks and becomes as if it is hardly worn. The lines will be formed right at the corner where paper bends.And the cover paper is not hard, when you wear in the back-pak the corners of the pages including cover paper's will be bent easily. The book will look very old fastly.The graph has not different colors other than black and white. Only black color is used in the graphs. You know that in order to understand different variables in the graph, one should seperate those variables by colors, but publishers or whoever did not do this, which is very bad.That is itPS Maybe Mr. Tom Copeland did not want his book be printed in such low quality papers and black and white color graphs, but his works should be published in high quality papers including graphs."
3,Good but bad Excel support,"I liked this book. In Russia it is one of the most popular books on valuatuion. But when I can get the perfect excel support for Investment Valuation by Aswath Damodaran or good web support for Valuation Methods and Shareholder Value Creation by Pablo Fernandez, I ask the authors, why don't they put supporting material in disk? I think that the price of their sowtware ($94.50) is too high compairing with the book ($56 with discount), because there is no supporting materials - only 1 spreadsheet (from my point of view does not conform to McKinsey, as the leader of consulting business). I hope, for the 4-th edition we will have a good excel support."
3,Buy yourself a large coffee mug before reading this,"Although Mr. Copeland's conceptual presentation and arguments for using FCF as the ultimate basis for performance and valuation is indeed compelling, the book falls as a practitioners' guide. Why ? Because Mr. Copeland never addresses a reality that all financial analysts confront ... accessibility / availability / integrity of data on which the analysis is grounded on, particularly when he focuses on subsidiaries of parent companies. Try valuing any one of GE's subsidiaries using Mr. Copeland's prescription ... good luck.Warning: familiarize yourself w/ accounting principles before reading this. If you aren't, you won't hesitate returning the book back to the book store."
4,Hudson & Landry Complete Collection,"It took forever to get this product--seemed a bit extreme. Overall, happy with the product."
5,Hudson and Landry: Timeless Comedy,"Bought the complete collection and played it for my kids. Now, remember, H&L were from the, what, 70's? But their comedy is timeless. Although there are a few references that younger people won't get, my kids just loved it. Anyone of the ""Ajax..."" seqments, Bruiser (although considered not P.C., but who cares) and the segments with the ""country hicks"" are hilarious. And on disc 3, track 17 ""Fate of the Mightiest Nation"" is MOST timely. If you haven't heard it, listen intently and be surprised at the end. Definately worth the price, even though the jewel case for disk one was broken, I can change the case. If you are contemplating ordering, don't wait. Order now. You will NOT regret it."
5,Absolutely Blow Away by this gun,"I just started my painting of the kitchen cabinets and I'm already sold on this gun. It's absolutely amazing, easy to use, easy to handle, easy to clean and provides a perfect smooth finish. I've never used a spray gun in my life, and I picked this up and was ready to roll.One thing I would recommend is making sure you clean it really well before putting it away, because you don't want the paint to get hard in the nozzle.Other than that, for this price this thing is amazing!"
1,If it weren't for spitting globs of paint...,"Sorry to be the wet blanket reviewer, but my Critter always spits at least one glob of paint (or stain or whatever) on the finished surface (usually more). Cleaning it doesn't help solve the problem. Thinning the paint doesn't solve it. You get excited during the painting because it looks like it's working, and then BLOP, it shoots a couple of big droplets of paint into the center of the work, so large that they won't flow out. I find it unuseable for anything that requires an even finish. It's moderately OK for stain, which spreads out and soaks in, but forget painting, unless you want it to look globby. I also own a real paint gun by Binks and there is just no comparison whatsoever in quality of finish. I wanted easy cleanup so badly that I purchased a product that doesn't work."
4,Critter Spray Gun,A simple tool that works well. Worked well right out of the box spraying 1 lb blonde shellac. Cleans easy. Uses readily available mason jars.
5,Inexpensive and highly effective,"A friend had one of these - we used it to paint some trim and molding pieces for a room in the house and I was blown away with its simplicity and quality. So, I bought one! It works great using my cheap little pancake compressor.Some tips:- when using latex paint be sure to use some Floetrol (available at Home Depot) to condition the paint. This makes for a glass-smooth surface.- fiddle with the air pressure before painting. Lower pressures work best for me on most materials.- strain the latex paint first to avoid clogs and ""boogers"" that mar your surface.- strongly consider buying the maintenance kit, including the short tube. We spent hours trying to find a substitute spring after it went down the drain while cleaning. The short tube works well in the smaller Mason jars.- buy some spare CORK gaskets at a hardware store or canning supply store. They will not tear easily like the paper gasket included, and will not melt like the rubber gaskets do."
5,Love this little sprayer,"I purchased this little sprayer to replace a heavier duty sprayer I was using. I so enjoy the ease of changing the container, as I change colors often during its use. I am SO happy with it for my purposes and you just can't beat the price. I bought it at the recommendation of a friend and am so glad I did!"
5,Outstanding!,This is an amazing product. It performs as described by both the product description and the positive reviews. I used it to paint an antique metal lawn furniture set. I used an enamel latex paint that covered well and cleaned-up great. The simple design works great. I would recommend it to anyone who needs to paint small to medium jobs.
3,Only adequate,"I bought this for spraying glazes on pottery. It's convenient to be able to use standard mason jars for glazes, though changeover isn't as easy as you might think. The spray pattern is circular and can't be adjusted. The week after I bought this I got one from Geil, and it is so, so, much better, at just a little more money. The Geil gun has been adapted to spray glazes, from an original paint sprayer. It has an adjustable spray pattern, and the fluid and air flows can be adjusted right at the gun."
5,Great for spraying glaze on pottery,"Several people in our local studio use the Critter for spraying glazes on pottery. We store our glazes in jars so that changing from one glaze to another is a snap. Just attach a jar of water in between colors and spray to clear. Then attach the next jar of glaze and begin spraying again.I bought a roll of gasket material, traced and cut out replacement gaskets, since I had read the paper gasket included did not last. However, other potters said they don't use the gasket at all, and haven't had any problems.If you use the Critter to spray glazes, be sure to purchase a respirator that specifies it blocks ""particles"". Not all respirators or masks will do. Inhaling glaze particles can be dangerous. Be sure to use the proper equipment."
4,Nice for the price,"I was looking for something that would easily apply latex paints and came across this sprayer. I remember having a badger sprayer as a kid that worked really well on models, and this looked like a sprayer that worked the same way - only bigger. The nicest thing is that you can use regular mason jars - and have several paints ready for spraying. Clean up is also very simple. I really like how this operates - it beats the heck out of my Wagner airless! The only reason for four stars is that they need to include more gaskets or offer a package of more here at amazon. You can only clean the first one you get so many times.You still need to thin the paint just a bit before spraying, but I'd do that with the Wagner anyways.I recommend this to anyone that is a DIY that doesn't want to spend a ton on a paint sprayer. This one works very well for the money!"
3,Not so simple,"Before I start, I want you to know that I haven't read any of the other reviews.That being said, I bought this book some years ago because I enjoyed watching Molto Mario on the Food Network. What he was doing on that show seemed simple enough because he used a minimum of ingredients (or so it seemed).I've tried to get through some of the recipes in this book without having to substitute one thing or another because I can't get them in the not so far suburbs of Chicago. It isn't so much that some of the ingredients are unavailable, but there are so many that I would never keep in a ""simple"" home.The stories are wonderful, but as a cookbook, it leaves much to be desired."
3,"If this is simple, I'd hate to see complex","""Take one Yak's kidney (the left one, not the right) and toss it with yellow-blue endive, freshly picked that morning from the garden of a french hairdresser's mother's cousin's chiropodist.""I only exaggerate a little.I'm sure the results of the recipes are fantastic, but I am tired of celebrity chefs selling their restaurant fare (which it took them years of intense labor and skill development) in cookbooks labeled ""simple"". If it were so simple, there would be no need to spend the money it costs to eat in their restaurants. They have the staff, the facilities, access to the ingredients, and the equipment to get done what most people can only dream of doing at home.If you want pretty pictures of food and some nice ideas to work from, enjoy this book.Personally, I prefer cook books that truly cater to the what the average interested home cook is likely to have at home."
4,"Great tasting stuff, but...",the history and geographical information is outstanding and gives the reader a great appreciation for the foods and where they may have originated. My problem is finding ingredients. A lot of the ingredients are impossible to find unless you live somewhere near an Italian community. Otherwise great book that follows along the lines of Mario's great show.
5,What would you expect...It's Mario!,"What can I say, It is Mario Batali! Mario Batali and Lidia have been truly inspirational to me as a fairly new cook. After visiting Italy I was looking for someone to provide real Italian recipes. What I like most about the way the recipes are presented is the honesty. Mario makes it very clear as to whether the recipe is Italian or Italian with an American twist. I've only had the book for a short time but have had a lot of success with the recipes I've tried.Molto bene!"
1,It Looks Better On TV,"My five-year old daughter and I love watching Food TV and, whenever he makes something, she asks if WE can make it. Mario is one of our favorites! So, I went out and bought the book. I was disappointed. The ingredients are difficult to find and, yet again, another cookbook that seriously lacks the pictures that would help entice you to want to make the dish!"
4,Lidia's Italian Kitchen,What recipes that I used are very good. I did find that they are not work intensive. I have watched Lidia's TV program and find it very instructional.
3,Good but Not Practical,"I bought this on a whim. I do not have cable television so I had never heard of Mario Batali's cooking show. I like the way this book is laid out and all of the recipes sounded wonderful! But I am not in the position to make my own pasta - I don't own a machine. I did make a chicken recipe that was stuffed with cheese, pine-nuts and nutmeg and it was great. I would like to try more in this book but I know I will not be able to find some of the ingredients; thus my question of its practicality for those of us that don't live near food-savvy locales (ie. NYC, LA, etc.)"
2,Hard to find ingredients in most of the receipes.,"I bought this book, based on how easy it sounded to make a few dishes, on Martha Stewarts TV show. After I got the book, I found that most receipes called for some very hard to find ingredients. I am giving the book to my daughter who works downtown, & may stand a better chance of finding the necessary ingredients at the ""specialty"" shops located in most downtowns. I think there should be an advisory about the fact that there may be some difficulty in gathering the various needs of some receipes."
2,simple recipes with hard-to-find ingredients,"I agree with the reader from Minnesota. I purchased this cookbook because of a favorable review, but have not been able to find many of the ingredients."
4,"A Very Good Social History of the ""Oldest Profession""","Roberts admirably shows the human dimension of countless women shunned and abused for centuries, yet who traditionally have made more money selling their bodies than they ever could have made at ""legitimate"" work, even today. Roberts advocates the de-criminalizing of prostitution, and she ably convinced me in doing so. But her book came out just after the fall of Soviet Communism, and the book begs for updated chapters dealing with the massive and horrendous problem of forced sexual slavery faced by well over a million women and girls from Eastern Europe alone since 1991. This clearly is not what Roberts intended, and she should discuss how people and governments might combat sexual slavery, a much bigger problem internationally since her book was first published, while advancing the cause of emancipating free agent sex workers."
3,Interesting but not exciting reading,"The people and events included in this arctic and political adventure make for a comedy of errors and an interesting read. But its style is very factual, with little color, and more like a formal paper than a compelling read. Not in the same league as Endurance."
2,how can you care when the protagonists are jerks?,"This book was not as exciting or compelling as I expected, chiefly because the protagonits were unappealing and uncharistmatic. I got the impression that the author was fascinated by all his research, but had a hard time culling detail to make a good book. The information about the bureaucratic delays within the US government, for example, were interesting, but did not warrent anything like the amount of tedious detail they received. I found myself constantly comparing the book to Lansing's Endurance (about the Shacketon expedition on the other pole), which was, in contrast, suspenseful, thrilling, and had a mesmerizing protagonist. On the other hand, characters in GOCSabine do turn up in other stories of the period, such as Issac's Storm, so you can see what happened to them. Overall, not worth much time."
3,It was OK (2.5 stars really),"I've read alot of pole exploration books lately. This one fell into the OK catagory; alot of names, dates, flashbacks, wordy sentences etc. Hard to follow sometimes. It was an OK read but by far the best book I've read on this subject is Endurance : Shackleton's Incredible Voyage by Alfred Lansing."
4,Down in My Darkened Reading Room Sleep Gray and Icy ghosts,"I purposely delayed finishing Ghosts of Cape Sabine. I saved the ending for one more reading. That night I wrote this poem, (obviously the ""ghosts"" were on my mind.)Down in my darkened reading room, sleep gray and icy ghosts. It's too late this eve to stir them up from their papery hosts. Long night must pass and dawn come 'ere their sleep be ended. When this reader's fingers will turn pages their sleep be ended. Then ghostly explorers will stir to hear, to see their rescuers!Those who do not hear or see, their bed is in the cold country. All will be shipped back to regions south, where waiting them, Mourners and greeters to embrace their return. Rescuers silently Bear the dark truths. Many who opposed the doomed expedition, Go on, with their work they go on, some to success some to fail. And as I turn the pages, in reading I free each spirited line That tells of who lived, and tells of who died-- the Ghosts of Cape Sabine."
3,accurate but boring,"This book very impressively presents a flow of information concerning the Greely Expedition and appreciated follow-up on the survivors until their deaths. It was horribly dry reading however, which is almost difficult to accomplish given the combined achievements and extremities of the expedition.I'd recommend this book highly to someone specifically researching this particularly expedition, but it reads too slowly such as a dulled text book for me to endorse it more highly than average for those that regularly seek gratifying non-fiction works as I do.I borrowed the book from my local library. Check yours!"
5,Great set of piston Rings,I purchased this set of Piston Rings and they are Great been running this mower for 2 weeks and NO SMOKE I refer this product to anyone
3,Does the job,It's a little flimsy but as long as it doesn't have to support a lot of weight you should be fine.
5,Best of its kind,"I originally thought the author might have been capitalizing on his fame from being the subject of another book: Tracy Kidder's House. I was surprised to find it more intelligent than the competition. And I was put off by the title, thinking the book was only about those things that make a house a work of old-fashioned craftmanship. But it's a complete tour of the housebuilding process, seemingly written from memory, so easily do the words flow.He shares his opinions, and they're always sensible. Mostly he eschews the cheap stuff, and telling you *what that is* is invaluable. He prefers plywood to OSB, wood to vinyl siding, and steers you away from roof trusses, vinyl windows, wooden countertops (not cheap, but not practical), and fiberglass tubs. He tells you where to install thicker plywood or wallboard, and tries to talk you into a real masonry chimney instead of a metal lined firebox. His style is succinct, never offensive, and witty. Best of the dozen or so I'm familiar with."
3,New home buyer,"Although this book has a great deal of good information, it lacks adequate illustrations. Those that are provided are simple line drawings where photographs would be better. Many of the explanations and descriptios of construction methods and practices would be much clearer for the novice if an illustration was included. There are several good drawings in this book, but just not enough."
5,Essential reference if you are building a house.,"There are four ways to frame out the corner of a room, using two, three or four studs. One way is cheap and unstable, two ways are adequate, the last method is top of the line. If you look at this detail at any construction site, you'll get a snapshot of the general level of quality and craftsmanship being brought to the project.This book teaches you things like that. It explains why you can't change the size or location of windows after framing is done, (a lot of that ""empty"" space in the walls has to accommodate wiring, ducts, plumbing, and other utilities, which are hard to redesign to allow for a new window).If you are building a house, and want to understand what is going on, this book is essential. (Did your builder install a french drain?)"
4,amazing symphonic Bach,This CD is an amazing journey into the wonderful world of Bachs most beautiful compositions. Leopold Stokowski is a great transcriber of Johann Sebastian Bachs music and his character and desire for orchsetral sonorities becomes evident in this great CD .
2,Not exactly what is on the CD,"Don't get me wrong--this is a good CD. It's just that Amazon.com shows it as containing the ""Toccata, Adagio and Fugue."" It only contains the Adagio from that great work. Too bad for me, it's the fugue I was wanting to study."
5,Exquisite voice - exquisite interpretations,"Della Jones is a wonder! What a joyful discovery is this collection of songs! Ms. Jones has a wonderful, expressive, luminous voice and her interpretations are full of grace, wit, personality and attention to detail. The songs are gems of beauty and personality. As you can see, I simply cannot say enough about the wonderful Ms. Jones and her talented, sensitive accompanist -I'm sorry - I don't have the CD with me right now, and the name of the wonderful pianist escapes me. Buy this CD. You will be thrilled."
5,A Donut Dollie Perspective,"It has been 37 years since I was a donut dollie at 2nd Division and reading Mark's book brought back all the hopes, adventures and everyday details of serving in South Korea.I learned of the book through another donut dollie named in the dedication and once again, I thanked the universe for guiding me to South Korea at the ripe old age of 21 to serve 18 months with a group of wonderful men and women.Mark's depiction of the Red Cross women was very accurate although the Beth character was far more liberal than most of us. On some level we all looked for that special man and in the process learned to value men as friends much more so than as lovers (some of us took that morals clause in our contracts far too literally!).If you served in South Korea, I highly recommend the book.Mark thank you for the very well written trip down memory lane!"
1,Propaganda,"This book was written back in the 1980s so the information is terribly outdated. The studies referred to are used outside of their medical context. The author, who is not a physician, also voices his own conclusions without any supporting medical evidence. More than half of the book is dedicated to discriminating against gay men and lesbians (also without any credible medical evidence) by relaying homophobic scenarios like the possibility of ""catching AIDS from a toilet seat""-an impossibility according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The author concludes by the last chapters that the entire homosexual population must be confined to camps to protect the public. This book is propaganda for homosexual genocide. Skip this one; it's not worth your money."
4,Excellent Book,This book was Excellent. Very thorough and well documented. A recommended read to anyone researching the subject.
5,Very informing!,"This book is very informing and thought provoking. A MUST read for anyone who wants to know the truth about AIDS, it's conditions and coverups!"
2,Gotta Be Kiddin',"George from Ottawa should have done this review under his ""Avid Oldies Collector"" sobriquet as you need to be REALLY avid, even agog, to want this compilation of flotsam and jetsam. Unless you are trying to acquire all of the songs ever recorded to hold, then sell for a profit--well, even if you ARE--take a pass on this one. People selling banana peels and calling them bananas."
5,My daughter loves this show,My daughter is special needs and we spend a lot of time in dr's offices and hospitals. I didn't realize if I got her a kindle fire I could automatically download them to it. So happy!!!
4,My 3 year old has mighty math powers...,"My 3 year old son LOVES Team Umizoomi. I find it interesting to watch the combination of animation and real people and to listen to the catchy tunes.In this episode, Milli, Geo, and Bot have to help Millie gather kite pieces for her kite. I only let my son watch educational TV, and in this episode he learns:1) Shapes2) Counting/math3) The power of teamwork4) To help those who need itAfter this episode, the baby dropped her toy and my son swooped down and grabbed it, saying, ""I'll help you!"" He then handed it to her while I said, ""thanks Team Umizoomi!"" That gave him a fit of giggles."
5,Good,My grand-daughter really loves this. It keeps her happy and totally captivated while she sits in Pap-paps lap. Thank You
4,Great for preschoolers!,"The PROS: The stories delve into mathmatics- numbers, shapes, and patterns, and my three-year-old actually repeats and seems to learn. There are not any other math shows he enjoys as much.The CONS: The price seemed a little high for the entire season, but buying the entire season is cheaper than buying one episode at a time."
2,"OK for kids, annoying for adults","This is a fairly low quality show that preschool children seem to like. However, this is definitely not a show you will want to watch together."
4,great camera bag,Perfect bag - we have relatively sm SLR - holds charger camera and one lens. Nice workmanship - exactly what we expected.
4,Good reference to formulas for treatment of injuries.,"This book lists many formulas to concote pills, poltice and medicinal wine to treat injuries arising from ""falls and strikes"" typically from martial art training. Some of the formulas however, are also useful to prepare and kept for use in household emergencies. A word of caution though, always see a doctor for serious injuries such as dislocations or broken bones. This is not a self treat book. For a non martial artist, I find that the formulas are especially useful in treating bruises and sprains.Although the names of the herbs are given in Latin and Pinyin descriptions, it may be difficult to have the formulas filled by your regular chinese herbalist as most of them are literate only in chinese characters.For the serious reader, it may be a good idea to invest in a good materia medica as a companion book to this one."
4,Good way to review Greek,"The size and style of the Greek text make it very readable. It is convenient that the notes are located on the same page as the text. This book is useful for a beginning Greek student or someone interested in reviewing (or resurrecting) ancient Greek. I was not satisfied with the commentary in the books introduction or the author's recommendations for further reading.More advanced students will be sorely disappointed with this text, but it is a good way to review ancient Greek or to read an original work for the first time."
2,Suspiciously Smelly,"The quality seems lower than similar products I own. The actual silicone of this pan has a more crude finish and different heft. That would be alright, but the part that has me worried is the smell. It's a plastic, chemical smell that my other silicone products do not have. Since you bake on high heat with it, the smell makes me question if chemicals will be breaking down or off-gassing into my food. Ingesting toxins is something I'd rather avoid, so it's going back."
2,We don't like it,"After reviewing a few different silicone muffin pans, I settled on this one for my wife. It was the non-stickability that I was going for. The long and short of it is this thing is no more nonstick than a cactus. I don't know who is giving it positive reviews.I cooked muffins this morning. Banana nut with chocolate chips. I did some in the old metal pan with nonstick spray and some in the silicone pan without spray. I even allowed the muffins in the silicone pan to cool to room temp before trying to take them out. I did use a thin knife to slice around the outside because there was NO WAY they were coming out. I guess if you use a spray in it, then it would probably be nonstick, but doesn't that defeat the point of silicone?Also annoying: It is floppy to the point that you MUST use 2 hands to put in and take out unless you have it sitting on something rigid like a cookie sheet, but I guess that's the nature of silicone."
5,Easy use and cleanup,This pan pops out products so easily and wipes clean with minimal effort. Goes from oven to freezer without problems.
2,Things stick to it,"Bought this to make egg muffins, and they stuck like crazy. Very disappointed, would only recommend if you plan to use muffin cups."
2,progressive trance..,"To start off this album is disappointing, or at least not what i was expecting. I had heard this was his best mix and best of the global underground series so it seemed like a good purchase. it wasn't bad, it wasn't good and it was boring. I'm more of a fan of DJ Tiesto and Darude (Ville Veridian). Basecially what im trying to say is if you are looking for decent rave music look elsewhere."
2,Oakenfold's Failure,"Paul Oakenfold, a name that will be forever associated with A-list djs. this needs to stop. i myself have been spinning for over 4 years, and i am very irritated at crummy djs being worshipped. this release is a decent release for people who don't really know anything about electronic music or djing. the mixing is less than good, especially on cd 2, where it is downright horrible. the tracks are spun in too fast or not even at all. the selection is alright, but nothing too exciting. except for the drum n' bass tracks, the music is not intelligent in any way, and i usually like acid and goa. i have to say that the only good release from oakey is the New York GU, where the mixing is still weak, but the track selection is absolutely amazing. save yourself the money and get that one instead."
4,Great Education on the Whitetail Deer,"I appreciated the in-depth study of the whitetail deer and it's habitats. A little slow starting, but a very intimate feel with an up-close walk beside an amazing creature."
2,"Ok, but not great","Charger works fine, but coiled cord makes it very short distance it will reach. Case is not well made or designed, never used it. Ear bud works fine."
2,Case...,I bought this for my BB Pearl and the case seems to small for the phone size. The holes do not match up to where they should be.
3,Can't beat it!,"For the price that this combo pack sells for, you can't beat it! The leather case is rather flimsy, but I mostly got the combo for the car adapter (which will costs you upwards of 25$ if you get it from Blackberry). The adapter works fine, haven't tried out the ear buds yet."
1,Blackberry,Really a cheaply made case that would be best suited for holding a childs play phone. Not very suitable for this type of product!
2,"Car charger is good, Headpiece is a piece","I bought four of these and all of the headpieces were inadequately shielded and they all have a loud buzzing sound that occurs in the middle of conversations, until they fix this issue I would not recommend buying this product"
2,"It's ok, but too primitive","First of all - it doesn't look like on the picture - just simple piece of not-anodized aluminium. It doesn't have contact. It doesn't have spring, flash shoe is fixed by small bolt on the side. The 1/4"" screw hole goes through, so be careful - you can damage your flash shoe if tight screw too much!. It works, just be careful. I think $7 is too much for such primitive construction."
2,Thin on Content,"This book is part of a series written by the author regarding various EPL teams, and it's highly superficial. Because the typical discussion for an entry is not thorough, it really provides little insight into the history of Newcastle United. There are very few photographs. Finally, the book was issued in the mid-nineties, and it provides little of relevance to the current club, e.g., you won't find anything in the book about Alan Shearer.All in all, this book was disappointing and, in my view, not worth the premium one pays in the United States for this British issue."
4,Best Articulating Ladder,"I compared this ladder to a copy at Home Depot. The Home Depot 16 ft model cost [money amount] + tax. The construction was not nearly as good, it had a two hand release (compared to one hand for Climbtek) for the articulations and was rated at 250 lbs. (compared to 300 for Climbtek). The ClimbTek costs a little more, but is a much better value."
5,Excellent Ladder,"This ladder was everything I was looking for... folds down to a 4-foot tall ladder, so it fits in my townhouse in the city. Easily configures to accommodate different tasks/heights. It's sturdy and well constructed, and it isn't so heavy or cumbersome that I can't carry it to where I need it. That, plus, like the Little Giant, this product is Made in USA which matters to me, as I look to buy an American product if there is this option. The Werner ladder is made in Mexico."
1,BAD EXPERIENCE X 2 = I lose $$$$$$,"I purchased this ladder, and it arrived broken. I assume this happened during shipment. I then sent in for a replacement, UPS came and picked up the ladder. 3days later the 2nd ladder shows up, bolts don't line up. It's impossble to talk to a LIVING BREATHING PERSON at Amazon to find out what to do. I then sent in for a refund they came and got the ladder again, then I read the refund policy...BEFORE YOU BUY THIS LADDER READ THE REFUND POLICY!!!! I know I'm gonna get SCREWED on this deal!!!!"
4,Vent Shade,"Easy to install.Look good,probably should have gotten the one that fits up in the window channel,but these are fine. Good delivery time."
3,Pretty decent running shoe and cross trainer,"I'm not a runner really and I bought this shoe so I can play tennis, but I can definitely tell the difference between the feeling from the shoe and my old pair of Asics. The Asics GEL technology is definitely nice and feels more dynamic upon ground impact. The Mercury trainer shoe seems to have these columns at predetermined impact points. It does add a little bounce to the run; also when I first wore them I noticed my gait changed a bit probably from the impact columns. I think it's pretty elevated at the heel but it's not too bad after you get use to it. Perhaps this is the effect of a cross trainer design, but I wouldn't know. Looks like a SHOX copy.I would probably stick with an Asics."
3,Shatner's Odyssey,"I give it three stars not because it was not good, but simply because it is not great literature. However, it is a ripping great yarn. It's true to the Star Trek spirit. Anyone wanting to slip into a quick read where you already know everyone will have no difficulty reacquainting yourself with the cast of characters.Like many Trek books there are many loose ends to tie together from TV shows and movies. Having tried my hand at plot development I can tell you how fun that is. Thus we find in book 3 (Avenger) why Sarek never melded with Spock as is traditional with Vulcan fathers and sons. There are other loose ends and the knot-tying is imaginative and believable.But when it all gets down to it the stories are good. That, along with believable dialog and solid prose, are what make a book worth reading. This has all three. Shatner has done well by Star Trek fans."
5,Great Router Bit,"This router bit works very well for me. I used it to cut out a groove in a pine toy chest because I don'y have a dado blade for my table saw. It worked perfectly. Make sure that your router can be used with this bit, because it is very long. You may have issues with the depth of cut."
4,"Rick Steves Packing Cube Set, Black","Haven't used it but seems to be what I expected. Comparable to other more expensive items. Will probably use it for underwears, rolled t-shirts and such more than other types of clothing. Looking forward to using it in a few weeks."
4,Smaller Than They Seem,"These cubes arrived quickly, but I feel they are smaller than they seemed in the pictures. I will use them, but will need to order more of the large size to accommodate my clothing for a week long trip. The small size (there are two included in the set) will only hold my socks and underwear. The large size will hold approximately two or three pairs of pants. I wish I knew this ahead of time so that I could have ordered the appropriate sizes. Still, they are very good construction and I do not regret my purchase."
1,Had a terrible smell,"When the packing cubes arrived they had a terrible smell (like fish). It wouldn't go away, so I returned them. It's too bad they smelled so awful because they looked like they would be useful."
3,Rick Steves cubes review,"The product was what I expected with the exception of the smell. The cubes came with a distinctive ""Fish Oil"" smell. I laid the items in the sun on my deck for several days before the smell faded, and when I used them in my suitcases the smell did not transfer to my clothing. However, now that I have been home a while, the smell is much more noticable in the product again. I will continue to look for a way to eliminate the smell because I do find the cubes make packing for travel and finding items when unpacking in a hotel much easier."
3,Too Simple,If you don't know how to knit you will at least have the basic's after this DVD. But I was expecting to learn more for my money
2,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. First of all, I question the authenticity of some of the recipes. For example, I have seen several recipes for Massaman (Pruitt spells it Massamun)curry and eaten it in several Thai restaurants and Pruitt's is the only one that calls for pineapple. Second, the chapters are laid out as menus rather than by main ingredient such as is done in most other books. If you really want the best Thai cookbook, my suggestion is to buy Thai Food by David Thompson."
2,Too many 'cons'.....,"Pro: The low price.Con: First of all, the warranty is for 90-days, not 1-year as stated. This was confirmed by a call to DeLonghi.2nd, The grill pan insert was a cheap aluminum piece that was bent in many directions.3rd, The interior light did not work.4th, If there is an automatic shutoff for baking, I could not locate it.As much as my Cuisinart convection oven irritates me with its design/safety flaws, it does seem of better quality than the DeLonghi. I guess I will not be giving it up soon."
5,LOVE AT FIRST BITE,"THE AIRSTREAM IS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE COOKING WITH A CONVECTION OVEN. THOUGH SKEPTICAL, THE AIRSTREAM WON ME OVER ON THE VERY FIRST TIME. IT LOOKS SMALL BUT IS ROOMY ENOUGH. THE FASTER COOKING TIME OF A CONVECTION OVEN IS GREAT TOO. HAVEN'T DONE ANY BROILING YET, BUT TOASTING EVEN FROZEN BREAD SLICES IS FINE.NAOMI C."
3,Book for Classrooms,This chapter book does a good job of explaining all of the ten Bill of Rights in detail. The book starts with the first amendment and goes through all ten amendments. The development and value of each amendment is explained thoroughly. This book would be a good one to use when a teacher is introducing a theme cycle about the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. A them cycle about the Bill of Rights would have many different activities to choose from when assigning work to the students. Using a theme cycle with this book would allow the students to explore and read various genres of text that discusses the amendments.
3,Spoiled by conspiracy,"Again in this episode, someone tries to kill JFK. For the first 90 pages I was hooked by good writing, interesting characters and facts. Then, one line gives away a big secret and what was entertaining goes down hill fast. Lose the JFK fixation and stick with a flawed, deeply troubled main character."
4,Stunning Accuracy,"I've known Homer personally for years, but in different clothes. Homer's rich racing background enables him to deliver a tale complete with stunning accuracy from the first page to the finish; except for the parts where his creative juices flow, and you really don't want to miss those."
3,Only travel DVD showcasing my homeland!!!!!!!!!,"This is 1st video (now released on DVD) of The Philippines in over 5 years. I review books & videos on my website about the Philippines and I have searched everywhere. It is an interesting approach, different than traditional travel videos. Conversation keeps it lively as you are shown some of the most beautiful areas covering several islands.It highlights romantic luxury hotels and resorts. Fairly expensive places but very nice to take your girlfriend.Unfortunately, it is not for those who want to learn about the true Filipino culture. Actually, the DVD movie ""Closer to Home"" shows more, so I recommend it. I wish there was a true new travel DVD about The Philippines. We have a great country, speak English, and I just do not understand why the ""travel industry"" so often ignores us. :-(Mabuhay, Jean"
5,GREAT STUFF POOR QUALITY,As with the whole series...great collection but sadly the quality is as good as I could do myself using my home computer to convert my old records to CD.More effort needed if they do more in the series.
3,For Collectors Only,"Contains several big hits that are impossible to get anymore, but the bulk of this album is British hits and covers. Check the contents before you buy."
5,Great,"Great, standard performances, very idiomatic, making up for slightly dated sound. Highly recommended , especially for VW fans."
3,An Opinion Worth Considering,"This book has some really radical ideas and while most ppl may not want to adopt everything they say, some of the mindsets and attitudes are definitely worth thinking about and should be considered for every young person's future marriage and relationships. A good read!"
5,"All I have to say is, ""YOU HAVE TO GET THIS BOOK!""","When I got this book, It was totally AWESOME! there are a lot of pics and COOL stuff that you couldn't of had guessed...I mean is was ""THE BEST"" I couldn't stop reading it...it's REALLy good...trust me!"
4,Not Bad,This is good book that briefly describes the events of Episode I in a picture format perfect for young and non-readers
5,Good stuff,I have a few of these and I haven't had a problem yet. 12 gauge fits nicely. I've opened and closed them many a time and the latches haven't broke yet.
4,"Great Info, but short",This book covers the information you need to work on in order to teach your children about firearms. It just doesn't cover it in much detail.It's well written and very informative. I totally recommend it. I'm just waiting for the author to do an expanded version.
2,Suddenly Began to lose teeth,This is the second saw of this type I have have owned. The first one lasted several years and I was extremely pleased with it. This one suddenly began to fail today for no discernable reason. What I mean by fail is that I noticed while cutting a peice of bamboo (that was not particularly difficult to cut) that several of the teeth had broken causing the saw to hang in certain spots. These had apparently broken off earlier while I was cutting some quarter round. The next thing I knew the teeth were all breaking off or bending. It was like the metal was suddenly failing!! I can only imagine that the alloy they used to make my first saw was very different from this one. At this price and with only casual use and I can't recommend this saw anymore. I bought it in November of 2010 and have kept it hanging in its plastic case when not in use. It should not be breaking like this.
2,"Heavy on personality, light on facts","While an entertaining read, the author injects too much venom to make this a balanced story. The author repeatedly attaches motives, emotions, etc to Jobs without attribution as if he divined Jobs inner spirit. The book also seriously understates Jobs business accomplishments in terms of the growth of Apple Computers, the success of NeXT (let's remember that Jobs NeXT for $400M), and the amazing success of Pixar. Only at the end of the book, does Young casually mention that Jobs sunk $50-$60M of his personal money in Pixar before it became a success.The author's basic premise is that Jobs is a con (hence the title), and that his success was stolen from Woz, Lasseter, and the brilliant engineers at NeXT. The problem is that facts don't support his hatchet-job approach.If you are looking for an amateurish psychoanalysis of Steve Jobs, then this is your book."
2,Read Alan Deutschman's review of this book,"I have a huge collection of Apple history books, and I was about to get this one. That is, until I read Alan Deutschman's review of this book in the San Francisco Chronicle. Deutschman accuses this book of being a rehash of three previous books: Michael Moritz's ""The Little Kingdom"", Jeffrey Young's own ""Steve Jobs: The Journey Is the Reward"", and Alan Deutschman's own ""The Second Coming of Steve Jobs"". (A web search for 'Deutschman ""The tight fist clenched around Apple""' should pull up the review.)For what it's worth, I would recommend ""The Little Kingdom"" (or ""West of Eden"" or ""Apple Confidential""), ""Infinite Loop,"" and ""Second Coming"" for coverage of Apple's early (1970-1980s), turbulent middle (1990s), and current (post-iMac) eras, respectively. And no, I don't have ties to any of the authors."
4,"Its not ""I - con"", it's ""Icon"".","I found this book to be extremely fair and balanced. It was a little troubling for Jobs at one time, but he came back with a vengeance and changed how we view animation, computers and music today.Everyone has ups and downs, Ray Charles was a drug addict / Ray Charles was one of the greatest musicians of all time.Too many people are reading the title incorrectly and saying that Steve Jobs is viewed as a conman in this. That really wasn't the book, try reading it next time.It's ""Icon"", not ""I - con""... if you can't figure that out, sell your Mac and by a lower intelligence machine... like a PC.The book was good, but he was a businessman... there really isn't much excitement from there on."
3,Whatever happened to free speech?,"First apple sues websites that discuss the company, then they pull all of the books by this publisher from their store shelves. Must techno-aesthetic movements always turn into fascism?"
3,Recreational Read,"A decent book to read but it is quite poor to be written by a professional writer....it does provide a perspective of Jobs and how he has managed his life.Smarts, Energy and truck load of Luck seem to put make very good things happen....."
3,Review: iCon,"iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business, retraces the dizzying path of successes and failures of entrepreneur and life long ambassador of technology Steve Jobs. Authors Jeffrey S. Young and William L. Simon produce an impressing and detailed account of Jobs' life and work which begins with Jobs' adoption and early childhood and ends with his (and Apple's) success with the iPod and iTunes. What lies in between describes Jobs' successes and his failures, his recklessness and his genius. The likeness Young and Simon paint of Steve Jobs is close to that of a hero; and like any great hero Jobs shows the ability to evolve with the use of his great strengths, despite his many flaws. iCon will be of special interest to Apple faithful as well as anyone interested in the history of personal computing or design.Copyright 2007 Of My Own Design, Josh Crain. All Rights Reserved."
5,Fascinating businessman's biography,A great summer read! This book reads like a thriller and is almost impossible to put down. The world needs to know and understand the underpinnings of success like Steve Jobs. What an important book for younger people just entering the world of business to read. Authors Young and Simon have done a masterful job.
2,Weak contents,"I was looking an insight to the personality, but there was very little to this topic. Very superficial description of how things went."
1,A disappointing book about a fabulous story,"A disappointing book about a fabulous story. The book reads as if it was pasted together from press cuttings and, if you look at the chapter notes, this appears to be how it was researched.There are little irritants, such as referring to Steve Jobs as ""Steve"" as if he's a close friend, but the big problem is that it recounts a number of interesting incidents in Steve Jobs' career while missing the main story. And what a fantastic story that is. I hope that someone has written a decent account of Steve Jobs' life because I would like to read it.One thing is certain: ""iCon"" sure ain't it."
1,Just awful,This book is just a waste of paper. Half of it was lifted from other authors writing. It's very poorly written and is a lame attempt to cashin in on the iPod and Apples success by slamming Steve Jobs. Trees died for this?
3,For people who likes to get a deep understanding of the present time,"It's not a matter of style , or ability to build a plot. S.Younger tell us the life of S.Jobs going behind the scene. Steve is a genius but of course he gets donwfaults too. He's a human and that's for someone is the new thing."
3,Interesting but...,"to many facts are repeated endlessly and presented in an ""E News"" fashion and celebrity status report style. I enjoyed the relativly objective critisism about Job's early stint at Apple and eventually even managed to extract usefull ""managerial"" tips which could become useful.Overall a nice weekend read. Not to ""Heavy"" and overloaded with factsbut this is also the weak point."
2,"Mediocre, inaccurate","This is a decent read; uninspired, but you will get some info out of it. What I found disappointing was the book is full of technical errors about Apple computers, computers in general, Steve Jobs, and the motion picture industry. Seeing the authors make amateurish mistakes like confusing hard drives and floppy drives, mixing up the models of Apple's computer lines, misrepresenting the complexities of computer animation, and missing or misquoting some of Job's best-publicized and most important pronouncements doesn't really inspire confidence in the rest of the material. It's as if you were reading a biography of Henry Ford, and it opened with, ""Henry Ford invented the model T and it was only available in white."" Even if the rest was OK you'd probably proceed with caution. A big Apple and Pixar fan, I did like the somewhat cynical take on Jobs, which I think is justified. If you can get it used, go for it, but it's not worth the cover price."
4,Biography ala Magazine Articles,"This book is unlike ordinary biography type of book. But a light reading, quotes many of Jobs' Keynotes, not many analytical, and yet a delightful reading during a relaxing time. Also lots of tabloid kind of life story (which might be too private) of Steve Jobs, that can be offending to Steve. I.e. Steve's body odor due to his believe that he is a vegetarian so he might not have to take a shower, Steve's releasing stress method by flushing a toilet with his foot inside, his objection to Lisa his daughter in the earlier period of his life, etc.If you want to seek strategic business information on how Steve turned aound the company (as the subtitle of the book might suggest), then this is not the right book for you. But for me, this book is informative enough for a light night time reading.The one thing that I dislike about the book is the unavailability of documentary photos of the revolutionary products (only Apple II and some PR photos of Steve)."
3,Amazing personality although only part of his life,"This book is about one of the amazing and and known technology leader in the Silicon valley. As a Cupertino resident I was lured to this audio-CD to learn more about Steve with all the traits he has. I find this book stopped only in the middle of his life covers from his childhood until circa 2005 missing one big product, the iPHONE. Also, the book does not provide much about Apple inside, the apple-way."
1,Really not worth buying,I would recommend not buying this book. The story jumps around to much between unrelateed subjects. I felt like I didnt learn anything new when I was done reading this book.
4,"Less Biography, more workings of a brain","If you want to know the history and life of Steve Jobs, this isn't it. BUT if you want to know his relationship with Apple, NEXT, Pixar, and Disney, then read. What this book gives is a look into his mind and it's workings than his history. This book is warts and all, and while it does humanize Steve, it dosen't kill his oh-so shinny reputation and reality distortion field at all."
5,An exceptional biography,"The authors of this biography are to be commended for depicting the complexity both of Steve Jobs' personal life and of his inimitable career. While maintaining journalistic neutrality, they show us many of the seminal - and oftentimes clashing - forces that have affected Steve Jobs, both from without and from within, leaving the reader to draw her own conclusions. Those who wish to better understand the complex and unique character that Steve Jobs has become, and the very successful businesses that he helped create, are likely to enjoy reading this thoughtful, in-depth biography."
4,Interesting read,"I found it pretty entertaining as a read. I can't say its the best book I've read, never the less informative and pretty well laid out. There are some moments in the book that you are lost in the story and not the history which I found amuzing. I say buy used if you can."
2,Dont bother buying this unless ..,"This book had such great promise but it lost its way. I bought it but i would say to you, don't. Unless you want to read a lot about Disney and Michael Eisner. That's right in a book about Apple and Jobs you would expect some storyline with Disney but the author let's his thought process veer so far off track I lost interest. Where is the more fleshe dout revelations about the dsign team at Apple or the hardware people who turned around Apple. Save your money and buy Andy Herzfeld's book -its great and real!"
2,"Interesting story, weak presentation","iCon dutifully recounts the various events in Jobs' life, but it somehow doesn't capture the essence of the man. The reader comes away without much sense of his personality. As anybody who has ever worked with him can attest, he has personality in spades, both for good and for bad. I remember him showing up in a business magazine's poll of the 10 worst bosses in the US. Meanwhile many have been seduced by his charm and vision. He is a rich and complex personality with patches of great light and dark, but the book presents more of an average gray."
3,For the price it is worth it,"this is the second palm z22 that i have purchased. the first one the screen stopped working just after the warranty (90 days) finished. This one i have so far for 2 1/2 months and is going well, we will see how it ends. it is a great palm for the beginer or someone who does not have the extra money for the other palms."
1,Bad after sale support!!!,"I bought the product 2 months ago. Now half of the screen does not turn on!!I called Palm store and they said they would not replace the device. They want me to mail it to them for repair, plus, I HAVE TO PAY THE SHIPMENT!!"
1,Z22 Is Junk,"I purchased the Z22 to store some account numbers/data, etc. I have maybe used it 6 times for brief periods. It will not turn on unless I fully charge it and then it works for maybe 10 minutes. The reset button does not work. It does not hold a charge. I purposely made a paper/pencil copy of the data stored in the Z22 given its unreliability. This machine is worthless. I heartily recommend you do not buy the Z22."
4,Preety good product,"The Z22 from palm is working well for me. I mostly need it as an address book, and it seems pretty good. Downloads to or from the computer are fine. Occasionally hitting some of the icons on the palm with the stylus do not work immediately, which can be a bit frustrating, but overall I'm pleased with the product."
2,Very Dissapointed,I was given this palm in July of 2006 as a gift and I absolutely loved it until it started locking up on me. The battery finally quit after a little over two years of use.After checking out the Palm help forum and discovering that the Z22 is only expected to last 1-3 years I guess I should consider myself lucky.Apparently it's more expensive to repair a unit than buy a new one. Very frustrating considering I had gotten to the point where I would use it every Day. I would not recommend buying this unless you don't mind shelling out 99.00 every two years.
2,I returned mine...,"After reading the reviews I decided to purchase the Palm Z22. I had had the Palm V which I loved. When I got the Z22, I did like the size and weight, but I couldn't get it to synch. I kept getting error messages. So, I returned it. Not to say it isn't a great product, it just wasn't for me."
2,Lukewarm Z22,"I'm sorry I ever left my Handspring Neo. This unit is smaller and has a color screen, but that screen is considerably smaller than my old screen. Some third party software did not migrate to the new unit, particularly a freeware password saver which I liked a lot. The program came across, but not the data. This new Z22 hot synced with my Windows XP and Apple Powerbook at home, but it won't hot sync with my Windows 2000 computer at work. Technical support suggested I send it back, but I doubt that will fix the problem. All in all, it's been a frustrating experience."
1,Just died one day...,"This item was fine till it stopped working...just like that. Battery had been charged. I used it for a month and then one day, it died. I had some new data in it that needed to be backed up...all lost!!!"
3,"Lasted for about a year, typical of Palms","I loved this, thought it was cute and handy and then it started the ""it won't turn on"" syndrome. I've had this before, with 4 different Palms the past few years. Nearly everyone giving positve reviews for this and other Palms are giving great reviews within a few days of owning the product--that's too short a time for electronic devices. So, frankly, I'm through with Palms, I buy from any other company. Maybe Dells or HP, who knows."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased the Z22 about a year ago after my Tungsten expired. I loved the Tungsten but decided to go with the Z22 in order to save a few dollars. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this decision. Reliability is a major concern; the unit periodically stopped working properly. The screen would go blank for a few days and resetting the unit would not remedy the problem. Eventually, the problem would fix itself. Also, the touch screen failed to properly work. Finally, after less than a year, it stopped holding a charge. I just purchased a Tungsten E2 and could not be happier. Upgrade and go for the E2."
2,Be wary of battery drain,"The Z22 has no way of disabling the automatic wakeup for calendar alarms. This may cause you to lose battery power much faster than you might expect. Especially if you do not constantly use the device for a few days and then expect to look up an address or phone number (think vacation).If you have appointments, the Z22 will turn on automatically to give you an alarm, and then repeat the process a number of times for each appointment even if you have the alarm sound turned off. This will drain your battery quickly when you think you have not been using the PDA. You can lower the time period before the automatic shutdown and reduce the number of alarm repeats, but you cannot make the display stay off and preserve your battery."
2,One problem,"I've had this Palm unit about 6 months. It works well but the battery doesn't hold much of a charge, nowhere near what it is supposed to. From what I can see from other reviews, a certain percentage of these Palms ship with problems and the support is not very good. Looks like I got one with a bad battery. Now the question is will it be worth my time and energy to try to figure out how to replace it?"
4,Great if you are like me.,"and are not into all the high tech brain cramping stuff. This was easy to use and I didnt even open the instruction manual. great color display and well worth 95 bucks. i bought the plastic case for 12 bucks that is sold seperately. I keep all my work passwords on it and i no longer have to call for password resets. i like it cause its easy, its like having added brain power that i do not posess. plenty of memory , some cool games like chess, solitaire, can hold a few digital pics like a virtual wallet. if you want , can cary in your pocket but i leave it in my desk. has a feature that maked you enter a password at power on.. would buy again, everyone who passes , says oh , thats pretty cool."
4,Does What I Need It To Do,I wanted a SIMPLE organizer to replace my antiquated Visor. So far so good (about a month now). I'm esp. pleased with battery charge life - that was a problem with the Visor.
1,Poor product,I too was disappointed in the product. I have had the unit for 10 months and it just went blank. Will not respond to anything. Before that it would always freeze up and I too had problems with it not recognizing the stylis. I only contacted the on-line support. Their support was excellent but they suggested I contact the technical support by calling. I didn't call because my unit is out of warranty and it would cost me to repair it. I figured for the price I could by a new one. I would not recommend this product.
1,Limited PDA,"No matter how many times I go through the process defined by Palm Support, I cannot hot sync more than once without again deleting and reinstalling the program. It is definitely not compatible with Windows XP Pro; hot sync does work more often with XP Home. There is no support at all on the website for the Z22; in fact it is not even identified in their listing. Additionally, in sunlight, nothing on the screen is easily visible. I had another Palm (M505) with huge problems, but eventually Palm support had the courtesy to call me and send me a disk to manage these problems. Not so with the Z22!!!"
1,Short life,"This was a great PDA for 9 months until it crashed. I had a similar experience with my previous Palm, but at least it lasted longer than a year. Once you get a fatal error--it's all over. I'm quite frustrated by Palm, and am not sure what other choices I have since my data is saved in the Palm OS."
5,Easily the best replacement for paper planners,"I bought one for my wife and she just loves it. It has a small form factor, long lasting battery, and NO DATA LOSS ever. However, it does not come with bell and whistles like MP3 player, fancy screen, etc. But as a electronic planner, it does an excellent job and it looks cool."
5,I like it!,This is an entry-level PDA and lacks many of the extras that many people want and will pay for; but it is exactly what I want and need! I'm so happy that I found the tool that is just right for me at a very reasonable price.
2,If you can't figure it out DON'T BUY!,"The product can be very useful when and if nothing goes wrong...I've had this product for less then two weeks before running into a problem that wasn't in the ""help"" information. I've made attempts to contact and done nothing but stay on hold for up to 30 minutes for the call to be ended on me numerous times. Up to this day I still haven't been able to reach anyone. The product is useless until then...hopefully no one experiences the same thing. Just wanted to warn you before you decide to purchase this product."
2,company problems,"I ordered this product as a replacement for one had broken. I received the order in good time, but it didn't work. I sent it back and the lady told me that she would open the next one, make sure that it worked, and send me a replacement. However, a couple of weeks later, I got notice that I was receiving a refund! Luckily, I was able to obtain a Palm Z22 without them."
2,Less than good,"The people contacyed via Email were more than helpful, Then product was poor and had missing parts."
1,"low resolution, and slow","details and colors are hard to distinguish when challenging applications and programs in use.Touch screen has a long response time. Don't buy ""brain trainer"" for z22, you will be frustrated by the slow response time and low resolution.The alarm signal on max is so quiet that you will not hear it being on a busy street or holding that cluncy palm in a pocket or backpack.Battery life has a long time only when used with calendar app. Chess trainer uses battery quickly.Don't trust those praising voices, these are sellers and wholesellers.Do not buy it, it is not worth the money."
3,Ok for someone looking to try palm devices,"The Palm Z22 is ok for very basic compact usage. It has the small compact design of the B&W; Sony Clie.The downside comes from using a model such as the Tungsten E. When you compare the screen quality, the Z22 is totally downgraded. The screen is small and the pixels are sort of distorted. The device chasis feels inexpensive."
2,Palm Down,"I previously owned a Palm that was indispensable. This one costs a lot less and is a lot less useful. For one thing, I could not get the software to work on my computer, so there are no synchs. Also, I had to make my own carrier out of my old palm wallet, using velcro. If you have used a Palm previously, this is going to disappoint. If you can get it linked to your computer, it would be worth it for new Palm users."
1,Would be overpriced at $25,"In short, the quality product you get doesn't come close to the price. You're better off getting a used Tungsten for $50 than drop $100 on this. The screen quality reminds me of their first color screen 10 years ago. The stylus is impossible to remove if you don't have nails or a coin handy. The plastic seems chinsy and easily breakable. But I guess since PDA's are going out of style now, there's just not a lot to choose from. Would not recommend this."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"I have never written a review before, but I just could not let such a defective product go unnoticed. I have been a loyal Palm customer for years now and decided to buy this one for my wife due to it's size and it having all the features she needs. After receiving not one, but two that were defective straight out of the box, I will be ordering a Tungsten E for her.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Palm has obviously not spent any money on quality control and does not care if they destroy their reputation by putting a shoddy product on the market. Even with the attractive price, this product is simply not worth the problems - it is not a value if it doesn't work!"
2,surprisingly poor screen resolution,"Overall the Z22 is not terrible for the price, but I was still surprised at how poor the screen resolution was. The person I bought it for still likes it and uses it, but I would have returned it myself."
2,disapointed,I was disapointed in this product because this product is not compatable with a 32 bit system. I think this information should be noted in a prominent place.
3,"Basic, simple Palm","This latter-day Palm Pilot was just what I wanted to replace my moribund ""Zire 21."" While its exterior, and especially the back cover, was/is somewhat scruffy, it does everything I need and want, and keeps me from having to sell out to Outlook or getting a phone that's smarter than I am. Money well spent."
2,Worked well for a time,"I was very happy with the Palm Z22 for almost 2 years until it suddenly died on me, losing all my personal data and phone numbers. I guess I was spoiled by my old Sony hand held, a very simple device that lasted for over 10 years with only an occasional battery change. I guess I should have been more careful backing everything up on the computer but still, I didn't expect it to last only 2 years. I won't be buying any more Palm products, that's for sure."
1,Don't buy the Z22,"I have had the Z22 for about 6 months now. Used sparingly during that time, maybe a total of 2 hours in that whole 6 months. The unit stopped working a few days ago. Won't charge, reset or even turn on anymore. Its worthless calling Palm. They just say its out of warranty and ""would you like us to repair it""? But their minimum repair price is $75. I can buy a new one for that.Stay away from this PDA. Its inexpensive for a reason. The construction is cheap, all plastic and looks lots like a throw away toy. I don't think I will buy another Palm product after this experience."
1,palm z 22,"palm z 22 is not working with windows 7, very frustrating, we worked for hours thinking it was our fault, finally read some blogs that all said they were having the same problem. wasted our money buying this item."
1,Caveat emptor!,"My Palm Z22 died after only five months of moderate use. It had never been dropped, and I always kept the battery charged. Don't waste your money like I did!"
4,"Simple, cool-looking pda","This is not a pda that is packed with tons of features. I am satisfied having this because I want a light, compact pda with basic functions (tasks, calendar, expenses, ebooks) for a start. It fits nicely into pockets. The screen is a bit small for me to read my ebooks because a portion of it is taken up by the graffiti. Writing with the stylus is easy and fun. The battery last pretty long. A good charge can last about 4-5 days for normal usage.I have received a number of compliments from my peers on its size and design. Some of them even thought that it's an ipod.However, the software got stuck on several occassions when I try to load huge files. Other than that, I like my Z22."
5,"First PDA, and Likin' It","This is my first PDA. I did a lot of research before getting it for my dad. I am the one reviewing it because I use it more often than he does.This is great for those who do not want to learn too much before using a PDA. It is relatively simple and works for most. The only problem we had was when the battery runs low, it shuts off until recharged. Just keep it charged and you will be fine. Dad loves Solitaire. Calendar is easy to use and it has great features such as the option of writing a note on Calendar dates (ie: we put in the address and details for a wedding we were going to that was easy to see when we pulled up that specific date).Overall, I love it."
4,Palm Z22 User,"I've used a Psion 5 mx for years. Unfortunately it is getting to be older technology and interface with my PC is no longer feasible; so I went looking for a replacement. At first, I thought I could combine my cell phone with an organizer. Unfortunately, they came with many things I did not want (MP3, internet access, etc.) I really just wanted a basic calendar with alarm reminders, contacts, memos for lists. Internet and email would have been OK, but I really don't need it. I tried the Z22 and have been very pleased. It has almost everything my Psion had and is very compact and I love the interface with my PC.I recommend it for anyone who just wants the basics in a compact package."
4,"PALM Z22 - Simple, But It Works","This is not the first PALM I have owned. BUT it is the best PALM I have owned. Does everything I would want, in a simple and small case which is very resonably priced. Want to know what you have planned for the day? Just push the ON button and there it is, the first screen you see. No batteries to purchase, just plug it into your computer and it charges automatically. Once a week or every other week is fine. The only thing this PALM does not do is make phone calls. AND you want to know the truth,I had a Smart Phone. Never again, the two should never have been merged. I highly recommend the PALM Z22, if you want an orgaziner that does everything, without complicating everything, this is it."
1,Tiny piece of junk!,"Many people like it and I would as well if it had not been for faulty software and many crashes. A letter to Palm's CEO is unanswered when writing this review despite mailed weeks ago. Amazon offered a replacement, but as the problem is the software that would not help.The problem is: You cannot HotSync on a Vista-based computer and then sync to a XP-based one or vice versa."
4,PALM Z22 Review,Excellent product for cost - some issues with keyboard recognition (may be because of small size) - easy to initialize.I converted from another unit and all data was transferred with no prblems or errors.
2,Basic and boring,"I purchased this z22 a month and a half ago. It served its purpose as long as it lasted. It was not woth it to me to buy a new one, so I got a used for $20 cheaper. It died completely with no warning yesterday. I have contacted seller for either refund or whatever warranty I might have.I didn't like this palm very much, the colors where horrible, yes , all of them, and the tiny keyboard for typing would often start doing wierd numbers on and off.I am getting something new and better. Oh, it doestn't work with the newest palm software, only what came with the CD and NOT with vista.Doesn't even charge via mini usb???All in all, it was not what I wanted and x-mas is coming up!!"
1,Defective Product,"This was the first time I've ever purchased an item that seemed quirky immediately. I purchased it for my daughter who is at college to replace her Palm III. After she tried for a couple of hours to get the device to communicate with her computer, she finally gave up and called to tell me it wouldn't work. Then, the next day, she hooked it back up to see if it would download files and it worked instantly. She then called to say she was thrilled with it. However, two days later it died and never worked again. I was afraid to try another one after reading others' reviews of the Palm Z22 on this site. Let me know if you have discovered a reliable PDA by reviewing it here.Amazon was wonderful! I was able to print out a return address label almost instantly, and a refund was made to my credit card within a few days of my mailing this item back."
4,great value,"This is my second PDA - first was a handspring that served me well for five years and which is still purring along. This unit, however, is more powerful and much more easily compatible with the lotus notes software my agency uses. Additionally, the cost was about a quarter of what I paid for my handspring platinum. I actually bought this particual unit because it offered all the essential features I wanted (plus some nice bonuses) and because the tech guy at my agency recommended it because - being more basic than many other PDAs out there,in his experience, it was less likely to develop the bugs and glitches and syncing problems many of my coworkers were experiencing."
3,Fast delivery but lack of information,"Fast delivery, but the battery is nearly dead, won't last more than a day instead of 3 weeks.Even if the product was used and I knew it, the dead battery could have been indicated, it is not the ""like new"" product that was announced..."
2,Nice PDA but not made to last!,"This is my second Palm Z22 PDA to go quit working after about 8 months of use. Both times my unit quit working after it was left in my bookbag in my car and the cold 20 degree tempatures killed the device. This doesn't happen to my cell phone, GPS or Sirius satelite radio. This PDA dies if it gets cold. So if you have one, never leave it in you car on cold days. I've also found out that very humid weather can kill this PDA."
1,Incompatible,"Nice little unit with all the capabilities I required but never could get it to sync properly with Windows XP Professional and Outlook 2007. Palm's phone support was pitiful and despite applying every download available on Palm's support pages, the unit would never sync. So, I returned it. The issue probably starts with Microsoft who wants to sell their own mobile OS, but Palm needs to overcome that hurdle. Consumers don't have the time, patience or desire to fight the compatibility curve."
3,Great PDA -- but doesn't last,"I bought a Palm Z22 three years ago, and loved everything about it -- ease of use, all of the different functions, and the versatility in colors and set-ups. A year ago the screen started to lose its responsiveness periodically, and I had to reboot almost weekly. Thank goodness I was syncing it regularly with my home computer, because three months ago the screen stopped responding altogether -- not even a hard reboot would get it to come back. And, of course, Palm wanted $75 up front to even look at it, much less fix it. I was destraught, since I need a PDA to run my life, and the PDA market has almost disappeared -- what's available now in the stores is netbooks and i-phones (neither of which function as a true PDA). Fortunately I found the HP IPAQ here on Amazon, and it has more than met my organizational needs. I highly recommend it to anyone else whose Z22 has died on them."
5,Palm Zire 22 Review,"Too bad this item is out of production. It meets my needs which are basic and simple - no keyboard, no texting. More is not not necessarily better"
5,Great for school use,"I purchased the palm pilot before beginning my senior year in college. I must say it has solved my organizational problems. No more carrying around planners and folding down the used pages. I simply sync up my palm when I need to load info and it is easy enough that I can make notes or record assignments when I am in class!PROS: Software works wonderfully with either MS Outlook or on its own.After just a few minutes of practice, recording tasks and appointments is quick and easy.Nice size, fits in my cell phone pocket of all my coats.CONS: None after 5 months of use.Highly reccommended for someone who is just looking to stay organized and doesn't need a ton of features."
1,Palm Z22,Evidently Palm went out of business. I have an apple computer which is now not compatible with the Z22. I'm using the device but I can't take advantage of syncing with my Mac. It's not a complete loss.
2,Garbage,"Buy yourself a smartphone. This is hard to use, outdated and total crap. It is increible all the good reviews it has received, for amount of money this product is incredibly outdated. I could go on about the horrible interface and even worst design, but you have probably already made your decision."
5,Palm Z22,This was a great purchase that I received for Christmas and I absolutely love it. Easy to use and navigate. It's easy to sync to my home computer or to my laptop.
5,Great PDA,"The Palm Z22 has been a great PDA for me. I had a PalmOne black & white and loved it until it broke. Replaced it with an expensive DellAxim that worked well but had problems getting it to sync with my work system. Gave the Dell to my husband and got the Z22 and it is perfect for my needs. I just wanted a calendar and contact list and the Z22 does this beautifully. The battery life is awesome. I've had it over 2 months and it only gets charged when I'm in the sync process and it is still at 100%! If you want just a plain PDA with color, the Palm Z22 is the way to go!"
1,Loss of data a big problem,"Twice in the past year (not once but twice) I have gone into my office and clicked on my palm desktop icon only to find my calendar completely blank. No idea what appointments I had when - heart stopper!! If you don't sync your data every single day to your handheld device, you run the risk of losing all of your appointments. Not worth it - I'm getting a blackberry!! (Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me!!!)"
4,Very Pleased.,"I am very happy with this product. Currently, I only use it for the calendar feature, which is all I was looking for. It charges quickly and stays charged for a very long time. The screen is easy to see/read and is fairly intuitive. My favorite part is that you can set it to display your upcoming appointments/events including the descriptions. The loudest alarm volume setting isn't loud enough for me. I would like it to be louder or that the alarm was more than 3 short beeps. (I prefer the alarm continue beeping for a period of time.) So far, so good."
5,Wife loves,"I gave this to my wife for her birthday and she absolutely loves it, uses it for everything."
4,Simple but Great Palm,"I bought one of these new for $99. It is cute, small and does everything I need it too. I'm not a businesswoman, so I don't need internet and document editing, just simple things like a calendar, contacts list and calculator. There are also some entertaining games you can get for the Z22 as well. The screen isn't the most amazing quality, but for the price it is just fine. I reccomend this to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, simple way to keep organized."
4,Best little Palm I ever had.,"If you want a device to store your contacts, calendar, ereader, email, etc. than the Z22 is for you. It works well and works all the time. It also has great battery life.This is not the device for you if you want to play games since most games are NOT written for the screen on the Z22. Of course solitaire and Sudoku work just fine which is all I ever use.I also have a $300 HP iPaq that runs Windows Mobile 2005. There is not enough space to list all the problems I have had with it.In conclusion, know what you want out of the device you buy. This is a terrific product for the money and it is the one I prefer to use most of the time. In fact, the iPaq maybe going on the ebay chopping block soon."
2,lost,"Loved it for the 1st year - passworded it since my life (i.e. passwords were in it) Screen stopped working last week so I was unable to unlock it. I did a hard re-set as the company suggested eventhough I knew that I was going to loose everything that was already on it. Didn't work, now it won't do anything at all."
5,Couldn't live without it ...,"I bought my Z22 after seeing my friend's. He showed me some of the features and I knew right away that it would perfectly suit my needs. It's simple to use and does everything I need. I am the primary caregiver for my elderly father and keeping track of his appointments, medications, hospital stays, doctors, etc. was a chore until I got my Palm Z22. Now everything is right at my fingertips. I always carry it with me in my purse so the info is ready when I need it. I love the color-coded categories on the calendar. They help me organize my appointments and keep things separate from my Dad's appointments and records and my husband's appointments. It's simple to synchronize with the computer and I love that it charges as it syncs. What could be easier?"
4,Palm Z22,"Very easy to set up and use. I bought this mostly to keep my ""to do"" list and appointments and it serves that purpose well. If you are looking for more than that a more advanced device would probably be a better choice. For the basics this an inexpensive, easy way to go."
4,I have rediscovered reading,"I'm not too much into the world of pdas. This is my first. I have rediscovered reading while on the subway, i also use it to read books on the job. It's small yet the print is clear. It's okay for showing pictures. It has a lot of organizing functions as well but I haven't used them much. I bought it mainly so I could read books on my tedious job without have to actually carry them around."
4,z22,"I agree with all the previous reviews that this is the ideal unit for your date book , memo PDF, contact list etc. Just be aware that this Unit will NOT sync withMicrosoft windows Vista - 64 bit systems. If I could get it to do that I'd be in hog heaven."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I was disappointed to learn after I received the product that it was not compatible with Windows 7, rendering it useless to me. Others have encountered the same problem and have posted comments that there is no way to rectify this predicament."
1,Should have listened to the other reviews,"There are quite a bit of reviews which state how this thing fails after a short period. I have bought several palmpilots over the years ranging from under $100 to over $500. I'm tired of them dying. The Z22 died on me within 2 months. I didn't drop it or anything. The screen just went blank one day and never came back. Last year a bought a cheap palm pilot for about $25 and I could not be happier. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but it keeps lists, has a phone book, and has alarms. I realized it's all I need."
5,Can't live with this little thing,"I have the original Zire, and then Zire 22 for years. I have changed phones many times through out the years, but not this little palm. This little thing is most reliable. It is very light weight and keeps me organized, no maintenace and cheap. The battery seems last forever - weeks or months which I loose track"
5,Perfect eReader device even if you have low vision.,"I bought this palm Z22 mainly for reading .pdb format ebooks. It is very light weight and has 4 different settings for font size and/or bold, not bold. I use reverse video and the eReader program provides that as ""Inverse"" screen. Using the ""midnight"" color theme for the device makes the whole device reverse video, accept for some of the individual programs.I can even play solitare with visual ease. I do not like the other programs, Calendar, only because using the virtual keyboard is tedious. But for the reason I got this device it is absolutely perfect for my needs.You can even program several of the buttons to do other tasks, if you choose.If you need internet access, you should buy the next level up in a hand held, or a smart phone."
1,Bad Don't Buy,"I have it for 18 month. It worked pretty good at that period of time. But now, I have problem to turn it on. I am not expecting to change palm for every 18 moths. I tried many ways but not working. If anyone is not thinking of change palm every 18 months, I suggest better goes with something else. I think the Palm z22 is defective. I have try to search for solution but Palm has no solution for the problem. Don't buy it!!"
2,Fine until it crashes,"This was a good, basic PDA, but both mine and the one I bought for my wife died unacceptably soon -- one after a year, one after five months (sorry, honey).I get the feeling Palm doesn't really want you to buy the budget item on the list... You get what you pay for, I guess, but the measly 90-day warranty just added insult to injury.Maybe Palm's pricier items are better quality, but I will think hard about buying a Palm product again."
1,Short Life,"My third Z22 just quit. Lasted longer this time, nearly 7months. The first two lasted just 4 months each. When they work, they are just the answer for me. However, I'm through totally with any thing Palm."
2,buy something else...difficult to use,"Buy something else. Screen is small. Resolution is poor. Screen not sensitive enough. You have to tap several times before the device recognizes that you selected something. The right side is especially difficult to use. If you try to tap on the down arrow, the device opens the program closest to where you tapped instead of scrolling down. It is extremely frustrating using the device."
4,Good little PDA,"Works as advertised. Small, good looking product. Not that many third party apps, but it doesn't hold much anyway. I just use it to sync with ical on my Mac. Works well for that. Easy to use. Good product for those who just want to carry their calendar with them."
2,Screen is so mid-80s,"When I read specs for this, I should have looked up ""160x160"". My ipod nano has a better screen resolution than this thing! Bought it specifically for one program that I would need to stare at constantly, but the screen is too bad.Also, this made me realize, PDAs are just not for me. I wish Apple could put a Palm feature on their iPhone and then I wouldn't need all these gadgets."
4,right for its price,I am very happy with it the only thing is that it is hard to find programs compatible for it.
5,awesome,"im completle in love with this thing. it holds all my dates and appointments and task perfectly im a busy college student and i always loose those little postits, this is sooooooooo much more efficient. also haivng pictures on it is kinda coool too. and i put a program on it that counts calories i can sync that with my computer and i have lost 10 plds with this palms help its awesome"
2,Extremely Useful - Except Battery is Worthless,"I absolutely loved my Palm, when it is alive. For a working mother of 3 it's perfect, except I've been through 3 in about 4 years and that's just not reasonable. I can keep my address book, key information and most importantly the family calendar in my purse and on the family PC. I love the price for what it does... if it lasted but I'm not willing to buy a new one every other year because Palm does not want to put in a replaceable battery! I'm living without it now. We still use the calendar and contacts on the PC and if they ever make the battery replaceable I'll buy another but as it is it's too expensive for the value it adds."
5,handi-dandi,"This piece of equipment is a terrific aid to memory. Especially important if you find yourself asking why did I come into the kitchen? I still can't remember that, but when I go shopping or have an appointment to keep this thing can't be beat."
4,Palm Z22,I just wanted something simple to replace the hand held I has used for years that had broken. I didn't want a lot of bells and whistles.I got that with the Palm Z22.
2,"Great, if it worked","I purchased this Z22 for my wife and she really loves it. It is great for orginizing and managing life. The problem is the first one we received wouldn't even turn on, the second one worked for 3 weeks and now it won't work unless it is plugged into the computer or power charger. We are sending that one back for service. I hope this isn't a trend! I am really dissappointed of the units reliability."
3,Disappointing compared to older model,"I was replacing with this Z22 an older, more expensive model (m500) that stopped working after 4.5 years. In comparison, I am very frustrated because the Z22 looks and feels like a toy and because Palm's changed software does not allow me to display information on the Z22 the way I was used to with the m500. Additionally, Palm's instructions for transitionaing from an older to a newer model are poor, so after hours of struggling with the process, (and thanks to a poorly trained tech rep on the phone with Palm) I eventually lost lots of very important data (despite having religiously backed up).I also really liked - for price, convenience and functionality - the integrated cover that came with my old m500. The Z22 lacks any cover or case except for a clear, vinyl film to ""protect"" the screen. The film was difficult to apply, does not go on without leaving some small, annoying air bubbles, and collects dust from my pocket."
3,"Good, but fragile","This is a great device. However, I left it in the front part of my backpack (where the pencils go) and it broke - even with the case. It's a nice machine when it lasts..."
1,Save your money,I bought my first Z22 new for $98 and it failed within the year I bought my next for $109 and it has lasted nearly two years both failed with the same problem the touch screen no longer works.
5,Palm Z22 PDA,"The PDA arrived in the specified time frame and was exactly as described, it is compact, rugged, functional and has lots of features many of which I probably won't use, for example the games. I particularly like being able to enter data on my PC and then synchronise it with the PDA."
1,Palm z22,This is my 2nd Palm Z22 and it is very unreliable. Some days it will not work at all. It is defective. My old one worked fine for 3 years before it died.Would someone suggest a newer model?
2,dysfunctional?,"Got the palm and tried to charge it. Would never charge past 50% capacity. Was unable to tap on battery icon to see what % I was at. Ran larger programs slowly. Probably good for basic stuff, can't run big things - maybe I just got a dysfunctional unit - returned it."
2,Unnecessary Gadget,"After using the Pilot for several months I found it easier to go back to my dayrunner. While the Pilot is smaller and lighter to carry, it is too tedious to enter data and retrieve the same."
1,no star,"I have used Palm products before & liked them (E2 and VIIx). this product - z22 is terrible. the stylus didn't work, and had to be used almost like a hammer to have a running chance of it working. I do notPalm Z22 Handheldrecommend this item! not an Amazon problem -- Palm really messed up with this one."
1,Palm Z22 Piece of Garbage,This is junk. calculator does not work. Screen does not work. I used to have a Sony CLie which was great. I getting my money back.
3,Ups and downs,"like the palm - miss some features of my old zire (click day advance, e.g.) - wish it were not so difficult to configure to sync with Mac software."
1,Lousy Product and Product Documentation,"Very disappointed. Following the set up instuctions erased two years of addresses on my previous Palm site, not once but on both of my computers. The unit itself has no protection for its screen (unlike my lost Zire 31). A stick-on plastic film is included but it s not humanly possible to press it in place without trapping multiple air bubbles, like the installation process, a poorly thought-out procedure. The unit itself has a low definition screen which requires hard presses of the stylus to operate. It's features are minimal, they didn't even include the basic solitaire game. As the old saying goes, ""You get what you pay for, and sometimes less."" This time it was less."
3,Graffiti defeated me,"I could not master the graffiti method of input. I used for about five days and decided to return the Z22 to Circuit City within their customer satisfaction period. Since others don't mention this problem and seem to be successful, it might be that I do not have the required small motor hand co-ordination. This skill MUST be mastered to use the machine."
2,Ick,"I selected the Z22 based on other Amazon product reviews as a good, simple, basic ""electronic address book"". I received it yesterday and just finished setting it up. While others have praised Palm OS as having ""gotten it right"", I beg to differ. First, I use Outlook 2007 - but the software as shipped does not support this and one is left to poked around the support site to learn that Palm is aware of the issue and has a patch. We're well into 2008 folks, catch up!!!I'm also roundly annoyed that Palm tells me how to organize my information - none of the categories in the address book can be longer than 15 characters and there may be no more than 15 categories. SORRY people, but the idea, I thought, was to allow me to organize my life MY way, not yours, and I have 31 categories - MY choice and if Outlook can handle it, Palm should, too.This is no better than the Palm it is replacing - which is only being replaced because it cannot accept the newest software.Ick."
1,A great PDA for four weeks,"I'm not a big fan of ""convergence"" devices - I don't want or need my cell phone to play MP3s, the calendar function on my MP3 player is of no use to me, you get the idea - and I don't need a PDA with Bluetooth, MS Office, etc., just a calendar and contact list. That's why I found the Palm Z22 to be so appealing. It's a basic PDA that should have replaced the paper organizers I've found to be such a hassle to keep updated (when your handwriting is as bad as mine, being able to enter information electronically is a true blessing). And replace them it did - for exactly 28 days. On the 29th day I pressed the power button and was greeted with a black screen. Completely dead. I was prepared to give the Z22 five stars, because it performed the basic functions I needed flawlessly, but with a life of less than one month I cannot justify a rating of more than one star. Sorry, Palm."
2,UbS cable,"Received the z22 ok. The supecial USB cable was not sent . I ordered one , it came but again it wasn't the right one. I need the specal cable . One with a button on the Z22 end.It is needed to syn with the computer."
5,Great Little Device,"I received my Z22 for Christmas. I have 4 children, 3 of them are extremely busy kids. I tried the calender on the fridge thing. That didn't work to well for us. I love my Z22. I can put my shopping list on it, all the kids appointments and activities. I love that I can give everyone thier own color. It has made such a difference in how organized I am."
3,Could be 5 stars if not for Graffiti2,"I love the Palm pdas. I don't need much, but this little gizmo delivers a lot for the price and size[...]. I especially love the little notepad feature that lets me scratch out a diagram or take notes with my nail! The ereader comes in handy when I'm stuck waiting somewhere. The only downside for me is the super slow Graffiti2. I don't know why Palm decided it was easier to allow 2 strokes vs 1 per letter. I'm so used to the original single-stroke Graffiti, it's taking me longer to unlearn my shortcuts to do Graffiti2. Plus, since the machine takes longer now to 'recognize' each letter, it ends up making a lot of errors. I have to force myself to slow down so the system can catch up. All in all, I still love mine. This is a good system for newbies to have. Just be aware that it only comes with 90 day warranty."
4,Palm Z22 review,"So far I am very happy with my product, my old Palm Z31 had less battery life than this one, and thath's very important to me."
4,Very nice basic PDA,"The Z22 does just what is advertised and it does it very well. The only (minor) complaint is the text is a bit small for bad eyes like mine, but its still very usable."
3,Palm Z22,"I had a Palm m515 for about 8 years and my biggest complaint about it was the battery life - way too short. When by m515 bit the dust, I was excited to find a replacement for less than $100. The Z22 has all the applications that I used before with a longer battery life. My biggest complaint is the very poor display. I find that the display cuts off or jams the text at the sides. It has an photo application but the quality is very poor for the photos that I would like to view. I had a cradle for my old PDA to hot sync which I never liked due to a poor connection, so this is better as well."
1,stops turing on,"I ordered a Palm Z22 in April. I was not overly impressed but it did suit my needs. Barely a month of owning it, it quit working. I could not get it to turn on. Someone else that had one said she had a similar problem in that it stopped working (coming on) as well. She left her palm on her dresser for a few months. One day while she was cleaning up she came across her Z22. She was about to throw it out but decided to try it one more time and it came on. She finally gave up on it when it did it again a month or so later. So I tried that --- it still does not work. I would not recommend this product to anyone. That was $95 down the drain."
1,Not compatible with Windows 7!,I have to return mine since it is not compatible with Windows 7. Palm tech support confirmed the definite incompatibility. Wish I would have known this before I had to pay a ridiculous restocking fee.
2,disappointed,"After about a year of frequent use (yes, it was handy) the touchscreen crapped out. After a disconnection and a frustrating call to overseas tech support, I had to hard reset the device, loosing all my data. Getting it repaired will cost about 70 bucks,take 90 days, and the data was what was important, so I might as well buy a new one---which I probably won't."
5,Great Buy,"I bought this organizer mainly for my home based business but I keep everything in it. It is exactly what I wanted/needed. The price was great and it is really simple to use.I love that you can give each catagory (person) their own color so just by glancing at the calendar you can see who needs to be where when.It is basic so if you are looking for bells and whistles this is not for you. All I wanted was something to keep contacts in, a to do list and calendar to keep track of family and business.It is light weight and fits in the front pocket of my purse. I always have it with me."
5,Excellent but addicting!,"The z22 is simple enough for people new to Palm to use, but it has all the necessary features to help you keep your life organized. The only problem is you'll become addicted to making lists and will try to store everything you come across!The one thing I would change would be the volume of the alarms. When there is a lot of outside noise and the z22 is at the bottom of my purse, I can't hear the alarm go off."
3,Z22 dies after 4 days of use,"I am new to palm, and I was so excited to see such a moderately priced organizer on the market. Yes, it's barebones, but that's what I am looking for. Four days into smooth sailing, however, the pda freezes up during a sync with my pc. After resetting a few times and having it freeze up after its initialization, I had no choice but to leave it on and allow the battery to drain itself out. I couldn't even turn it off.Hopefully you'll have better luck than I had."
2,Died for No Apparent Reason,"I absolutely loved my Z22 ! But today, after owning it for less than a year, the unit just died on me - can't turn it on and it won't start up when I plug it into my computer. It just dropped dead with no apparent cause. Nothing had happened to it - it hadn't been dropped - it wasn't exposed to extreme temperatures. I had just entered some info, and ten minutes later when I went to turn it on, it would not start up.I've lost a good friend."
1,Won't work with XP at the office,"This Palm ""lite"" may be fine for home users, but if you have Windows XP at your office, it is probably Windows XP Professional. Palm Z22 won't consistently synchronize with XP-Professional, and Palm does not support it. This is very disappointing...all I want is the basics (a portable roladex and day-planner). Since I'm buying this out of my own pocket, I don't want to pay for bells and whistles I won't use. Palm needs a KISS handheld for professionals. The Z22 is not it."
1,It was a mistake to switch to the Z22,"I've used Palm products since they first came into the market. I bought the Z22 to replace my Tungsten E because I was seduced by the lighter weight, clean white design and bright color options. This was a big mistake! It has been an overall disappointment! It has less command buttons on the front and I miss them. It has a ""cheap"" feel to it. The screen is significantly smaller, so small that I had to enhance the font in order to see it. It has very little memory available after initial set up. But worse of all, in less than one week, the Z22 has needed to be reset 4 times because of freezing up! This is a surprisingly poor product from the otherwise superior Palm family of products. True, it is inexpensive at under $100, but it doesn't need to be ""cheap"" because of the price!"
1,Died after less than a year of service,"Very dissappointing. After less than a year, the screen went kaput, I cannot access my telephone directory. It just became an expensive useless gadget. I downloaded the software from Palm's website hoping that by doing this it would fix whatever glitch the Z22 had, but no luck. If I could give it a negative 5 rating, I would."
2,Not the best,"This was my wife's introduction to a handheld organizer.Yes, it was handy and did most of what she needed, but she had a hard time having the date NOT roll back to 1995. The batteries also tended drain faster than she anticipated.Not bad, but not the best."
5,Palm Z222 PDA,"Excellent basic PDA with Palm functionality. Easy set up. Used this to replace a 2 year old HP PDA (bad circuitry) , using Microsoft Outlook and Windows 95SE."
3,Good enough and a good price,"This is a minimal Palm, with a small and barely readable display, modest memory, no external communication except for a PC link, and no telephone. But that is what I wanted when I bought it, and it functions quite satisfactorily for my major application (ePocrates in a medical practice)."
3,Palm Z22 Review,"Product is small and quite inexpensive. The display will show some vertical lines at times (the way the LCD functions). The display has quite low resolution. For a basic Date Book and Calendar it works fine. The digitizer is MORE reliable than a T/X. So far, I am not disappointed with the unit. After two defective T/X units I decided to get a different, possibly more reliable unit, and so far, I think I have done that."
3,Palm Pilot,The charger for the Palm Pilot is defective. The company helped to determine the problem and to resolve the problem
2,How get support when it stops working?,"I purchased this Palm Z22 August 16, 2007 and it worked great until today December 4, 2007 when it just stopped working without any obvious reason. If anyone knows how to diagnose problems or get support from Palm please attach your review to this one. Thanks in advance."
2,Alarm barely auduble,This product is useless as a reminder. I can barely hear the alarm even on the highest setting. I have to take medications twice a day and I got this to remind me. An expensive address book is what this is.
3,A decent basic handheld,"This unit provides the basics of a handheld with none of the extras. A decent unit at a good price. The air case works well-- light, unobtrusive, easy to access the PDA. The disadvantages I've found so far are that the screen is not terribly responsive to the stylus. There is a lag between tapping the screen and the appearance of what you clicked on. The accuracy of response to the Graffiti is even worse. Visually, the fonts are tiny and the clarity is not great. Altho I can change the size and format of the font for the phone directory, once I tap on the person's name, the phone number appears in a tiny font."
1,Worse than a virus or a worm!!,"The software for this thing, in both its download form and disc, essentially destroyed the operating system of the (Dell) computer on which it was installed. There were no warnings posted or printed about potential problems,and there are no fixes available from Palm.I strongly suggest avoiding this product, and being VERY careful with any other Palm unit. There are plenty of less dangerous alternatives."
2,RETURN Z22,it was incompatible with my system and could not synchronize. i sent it back for a full refund! i need my credit to my VISA account ASAP! from Amazon.com
1,Palm Z22,This PDA is smaller than I want and it is difficult to synchronize to my computer. The instructions are not very good.
1,Why?,"My wife really wanted this thing for Christmas. $100 later, she has yet to look at it. I can't figure out why you wouldn't just carry around a printout of phone numbers and save the money and hassle of this thing. It has no purpose."
1,"A basic, limited, piece of junk. Not worth one cent.","The terrible: no advanced functionality, terrible looking screen, doesn't support Microsoft Outlook 2003 or later, total lack of driver support.The positive: cheap. That's about it."
3,Graffiti is driving me crazy,"I've used PDA's for years (...PalmV, Vx, Tungsten T) and just didn't want to upgrade to something I didn't need. I really just wanted the basic features. Other reviews commented on the poor ""reception"" of the graffiti feature, and I was hoping it wasn't that bad, but it's driving me crazy! I'm very good at graffiti and use it a lot and this machine CANNOT get certain letters. It is SOOOOOO frustrating when you just want to jot down a simple word. Still can't figure out why it won't take ""i"". I'll live, but word to the wise...it's probably worth paying a little more for better graffiti reading."
