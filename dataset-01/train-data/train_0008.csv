3,"Fascinating, but depressing!","Captivated by Love In The Time Of Cholera, I had to have this book to continue with the works of this author. Couldn't put it down, then struggled with overwhelming gloom after finishing it. He pulls the reader into the tale; you smell, touch, feel, and live the moment. Unfortunately, the moment is a bad place to be. Not for the faint of heart."
5,Amazing!,"This is absolutely the most wonderful book I've ever read. I read more than one book every week, so what can I say!! A must read, which you will not want to put down. There's so much to this than just the story.. Beautifully written and wonderously haphazard presentation!"
2,lesson in the depravity of man,"As I opened this book, I thought to myself ""Wow! This seems like a great story!"" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember...."
3,Time Passed,The story line was very interesting and compelling but the family structure was very disturbing.The Buendia family are not very loving or emotional towards each other.
3,One hundred years of overrated,"I usually love anything that our girl Oprah says to love. But not this time. This book was good, but at some times it was hard to follow. This novel was difficult to keep straight. I probablly would have given it a extra star if everyone wasn't named Jose something or something Jose(sorry, I can't get the accent thing to work). This novel did run the gauntlet from comedy to tragedy and love to death to war and everything in between witch made it very emotional. This book was also a kind of history textbook witch is ok if history is in your blood (no pun intended) but it is not in mine. Irregardless it was emotionally satisfing. But it could have been improved if it could have been simplified."
1,This books should be banned for 100 years in SOLITARY,"This book won the NOBEL Prize? I just can't help it, I need to write another review.This book should be placed in Solitary Confinement for 100 years. This is to save both time and trees used in printing of this book.Do not even dare buy this book even from a 2nd hand bookstore. Believe me, do not waste your money."
2,Not the best book ever,"My High school english teacher swore that this was God's gift to literature. I tend to disagree. I understand what Garcia Marquez is trying to get at with his symbolism, but the reptitious names and slow plot make a good book lag."
1,"An Oprah Classic (in other words Boring, a Non-Sense Story,","It was a required reading in college in 1990. It was boring then as it is now. No wonder it was selected as an Oprah Book Selection. Most Oprah's book are boring but with HYPE.The story does not follow any logic even within the story itself. You will get confuse with the repeated combination of names that are used througout the story. I believe there are only 5 (Jose, Aurelio,Miguel, etc) Fiction does not follow logic I know but usually a story (even a work of fiction) sets boundaries within the story itself and are bounded by this limit. This story is a waste of paper on which it was written. Marquez is one of those overhyped writers with nothing to show for. I guess this is the result of some literary critic needing to sell some books to get a comission from the publishing house.Sorry if I was mean but I was forced to read it college and felt that it was a waste of time and money."
1,"Bad, bad, bad",What a horrible book; hard to read; too many characters; I never did figure out what the whole thing was about. I can't believe this won a Nobel Prize. Definitely a waste of time reading.
1,Can I give it -9999 Stars instead?,"Yawn. 400 some pages of nothing but incest and death. Characters with the same name throughout the book. Non-linear time, too, it's very hard to follow. How could this ""book"" change your life? I have come to fear love, it's like your emotions are being dragged through the mud and everything you hold dear and ethical are just pushed away like its nothing. It was about incest, personally, maybe something was lost in the translation. It was so depressing and disturbing. I could not sleep without lights on after I finished reading it. I would never suggest this book to anybody who has a weak constitution or is easily emotionally disturbed. NOT good reading for a highschool student. Even Faulkner's The Bear was not about incest (it was bad too)."
2,I tried really hard....,"I expected that this book would be wonderful. Many friends urged me to read it and so I did - up to page 168. I think I just don't get it. I began to get sea sick from being at times engaged in the story to next wondering what the point of reading it was. War after war, sex after sex, baby after baby.... it got old and so I gave up. Hooray for all who get the beauty of the story and enjoy it. I wish I had been able. Next....."
1,Book,"This book is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the book. I could not understand this book at all."
2,Too melodramatic,"This novel is written in very interesting and compelling prose, but its characters are hardly worth the effort. The charaters are obsessive bores that can only be compared to day time soap opera characters. After reading through half of this novel, I was so numb from the constant tragedy and melodrama, that I simply did not care what happened to the characters anymore. To make matters worse, the plot is extremely complicated and very difficult to follow, with new characters added every chapter.The most amazing thing about this book is its popularity and that it helped its author win the nobel prize."
2,Disappointing read,"I was expecting a consistent story or at least an engaging narrative that takes fantastical twists. Instead, so many characters are introduced (many have the same name) making it very difficult to care about any of them. Also, the struggles between the rebels and whoever it is they are fighting (and why, come to think of it) are vague and uninteresting. I can't imagine what about this book is so transfixing to so many people. Count me out, I guess."
3,"Lyrical, but Tedious","It's fun to tell members of the overeducated elite that you didn't care for this novel. After puffing up a bit and expostulating upon Garcia Marquez's qualifications as an ""important"" writer, and upon the novel as a ""modern classic,"" most give in and admit that it wasn't a particularly good read for them, either."
3,100 years of solitude,"The story itself is a tedious read for todays readers. It meanders along with no real definitive reasoning and of course conclusions.I knew before I purchased the book, that it was a difficult story narrative to focus on. I did not enjy reading it and could not finish the story without skimming through the middle to the end."
3,More entertaining than Oprah,"To get a sense of this novel, think of a cross between ""Dallas"" or ""Dynasty"", and ""The Simpsons"", only set in a mountainous Colombian village, and imbued with hokey magical realism."
1,Don't waste your time if you don't absolutely have to.,"I read this for a college course. If this is the best the world had to offer at the time (Pulitzer Prize winner), then I fear for this nation. It was confusing at the beginning (conflicting ideas presented - it speaks as if it were the beginning of the world, but the characters find ancient items). And the story line is jumbled.Personally, I found no enjoyment in the reading of it. The symbolizism that we were supposed to find was buried so deeply that I had to research it on the internet. I finally found a few things written on the symbolism, had to re-read most of the book to find it, and consummed quite a bit of headache medicine to get through it.It was far too long for what it had to say...which wasn't much. Never have I burned a book in my life. I took special joy in planning an overnight camping trip for the sole purpose of watching it burn."
3,Very intricate book.,"I wanted to read this book because of the title.It really intrigued me.But during reading I could not find any solitude.Life of people in Macondo was overfilled by lonless, but everyones life is like that.The only character I like is Jose Arcadio Buendia because his way of isolation was very comical.It was funny when he sat over the tree and did exactly nothing.I enjoy making the gold fishes by his son,too.The end took by surprise on me.However, my feelings after reading was not very fast and I felt like did not get that, what I had expected.I think it needs a few rereading to understand it."
5,Gabriel García Márquez greatest novel,"This is the novel that made the author succeed and it's obvious why. A story which seems it's never going to finish, has an incredible ending (I read the last page like a hundred times already). A personal advise would be to get a chart of the family tree, otherwise you may not enjoy it as I have"
3,There are better choices,"I don't understand all the hype with this book. I bought the book and the companion spark notes prepared to read one of the world's greatest books. What a grind! Repetion and silly literary tricks. You'd do better to find another ""classic"" like Moby Dick, Don Quiote, some Faulkner, some Hemingway, Stegner, Steinbeck, etc.At least now I can brag that I read it. Unfortunatley I could have spent the time reading something more rewarding.If you want Spanish authors, try Jorge Borges. Now there's a great writer! Deep though. Be prpared to ponder the symbolism....but it's different than pondering Marquez' symbolism. Marquez has a style where things don't necessarily make sense so you think ""he's a great writer so it must be symbolic -- otherwise he wouldn't have lead me down this path"". Borges, on the other hand make the story interesting AND DEEP."
3,One Hundred years of Solitude,"As usual, the writing is excellent in this book. Good descriptions; it always draws you right into the setting and the story like you are really there. The only problem I have with it is that there is not much of a plot. I am on about page 100 out of 400, and I don't know where this story has any more room to grow. There are a lot of characters and sometimes the whole thing is a little thick and I struggle to keep up, much less have the will to."
2,"Fine, if you're that way inclined","Pretty easy to read, but a load of tosh, drivel,whatever you call it. I see the comparisons with Rushdie here. If you're into this sort of writing then fine. Read Rabelais instead, at least you get a bit of a chuckle."
1,Drawn Out,"100 Years of Solitude is a dense, confusing novel that is seemingly endless. Most of the characters have the same name - either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano for the boys and Amaranta or Remedios for the girls. The chapters are long and have large amounts of action. Most of the chapters are very similar: incest occurs, a child is born, named Jose Arcadio, he studies Melquiades, fights with some people, has a mistress, several children, and then dies. I do not recommend this book for anyone that wants a quick/easy/interesting read. It is well written and conveys many themes and such, but is purely painful to read."
2,Creative but boring and aimless,"Though this story was written in a unique voice, it is not the great classic that everyone claims it is. It often wandered and was full of characters who's personality and dialogue (not to mention names) were all so similar that you could hardly tell them apart.Let's be honest, it's only trendy to read this right now because it was featured on Oprah's Book Club. Don't believe the hype."
1,I DON'T GET IT,"I don't understand why Gabriel Garcia Marquez will get such great reviews on 100 years of solitude, I thought it was one of the worst piece of Magical Realism that I have ever read.Don't waste your time or money on this terrible piece of literature, Sincerely, it is a pointless, mediocre and most definitely not Nobel Prize material."
2,Could never read this book....,"This is what I think my problem is... I didn't like the translation of the book. If the novel was written in Spanish and then translated into English, I would sit there and say to myself that I loved the descriptive, but not the flow of the sentence. I am compelled to give this novel another try based on these reviews. It has been a few years and I feel it is well deserving."
1,The Emperor's New Clothes,"After a couple of chapters into the book I went online to check why so many people felt that this was one great work of literature. The words I found repeatedly were magical and enchanting....When a grown man has the desire to take a nine year old girl to be his ""wife"" and gets her pregnant, than I don't feel enchanted but repulsed. Fiction or not. Actually to make that up, speaks for it self as far as I am concerned. And Oprah of all people to recommend that in her book club. I clearly missed the point about a lot of things and that male characters shared names did not make it any easier. My husband read it as well and we felt the same about most passages. I was glad when I finally finished it, as I really wanted to know the whole story before making up my mind."
4,"wonderful, wonderful","Wonderful, wonderful! This book is so packed with such magical scenes. Witty. Funny. Outrageous. One of a kind characters. I can read it all over again and still find a lot of details I never noticed before. Everytime I read this the story always seems new. Definitely one book for all who love books."
5,Vacation from reality,"Garcia-Marquez is my favorite autor and ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" is a wonderful book, one that should be read by every intelligent reader. He deftly suspends the laws of reality and takes you to a world that will leave you with the feeling that you have just returned from a rejuvenating vacation. This book is not to be missed. The writing is at once mystical and cathartic, and it will leave you breathless."
5,"Very creative, very imaginative","No wonder this book has become an instant classic. It is. This is probably the best translated book that I've ever read. Very confusing, at first, but very imaginative. More of a fantasy than anything else, really. Much better the second time through. I loved the characters and the setting!"
5,100 Years of Solitude. The standard for South American Lit.,"100 Years of Solitude is a must-read for anyone intrested inmagical realism and the beauty of South American literature.It is simply the standard by which all other Latin AmericanNovels will be judged, but putting aside the lofty complimentsfor a moment, 100 Years of Solitude is a necessary journeyfor any reader engaged in the human struggle and the cycle oflife.The novel's lyricism is as simple as a journey down a calm river, yetas complex as the idea of gravity pulling that water down theriver. It is this lyricism that sets Gabriel Garcia Marquezapart from the other story tellers of his time--and a storyteller is exactly what Marquez is, a story teller of grandproportions, that will keep you sitting at the fire with himuntil his epic story is complete."
2,"look, have any of you actually written a paper on this book?","well I have, and this book has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever tried to write about. It is basically about nothing, and I had to write about that for a school paper! you would hate it too if you had to write about it for a flippin' school paper! Really, need I say more? I bet the people who loved it never had to write an essay about Amaranta's repeated refusal of love, and in about a week! Just ask everyone who's a junior at my school! It is a torture manual! Far too beastly a book to be dealt with, even for most english majors and teachers!I give it two stars because it has more substance than the stuff Allende and Amado put out."
1,more stars than the firmament....,"I wish I could have given this book ""no stars:"" it's a book that deserves every star that man, god or science has created, and nothing we can put here on the internet (or in any review in any medium) would do it the eternal justice it deserves. A dream of a book: I would pick it up the day after having read forty pages, start the next chapter, and wonder where it was I had left off the night before. A book that gives off narcotic fumes, that gives off disembowling violence, love, and indifference. A book that deserves more awards than humankind can bestow."
2,Super dissappointed,I have not yet read this book but am looking forward to doing so as I have heard from friends that it is wonderful story. However I am super dissappointed at the poor quality of this item. The paper is obviously re cycled and has been cut extemely unevenly. I understand the need to recycle but was not advised prior to purchase that this is the policy of Amazon.. Consequently as this is the 2nd book I have bought in this condition I will not be purchasing any further from you at any time. I have sourced another good priced on-line book seller. Thank you.
1,A fad which no one will remember in 100 years,so mr marquez is supposed to have invented this whole new genre of writing with this book and other annoying ones like In Evil Hour. But no one seems to stop and say that the events of the story are ridiculous and embarrasing. who wants to read about an old lady who makes candy for her family for generations? no one. and the romance portrayed is nothing short of farcical. it's a wonder he's a star in the literary universe.
2,And the point is?,"The book jumps all over the place, and the point is? Magical? I suppose so. Depressing? Oh yeah. Why does Oprah pick one depressing book after another?"
1,why fill your mind with trash?,"this book was trash to my mind, why fill your mind with junk? What good knowledge are you getting from this book, knowledge that is valuable to the mind and soul? NONE! It does not leave you with a good feeling!"
2,A book that left me indifferent,"This was my second try after 30 years to read this book. First time I abandoned after some 20-25 pages, this time I got as far as page 150.And I got this far because I thought that maybe I'm missing something, it can't be that so many people praise this book and I am the only one who doesn't like it. But after 150 pages and three generations of Aureliano and Accadio, in which almost anything happens, in which you hear love stories and war stories and fantastic stories and so on,suddenly I didn't feel curious what's next.First time I abandoned this book because the magic realism wasn't my cup of tea at that time. This time I quit because the book wasn't catching me , didn't make me feel any emotions about the characters, didn't make me curious about their fate.Someone said about this book that you either love it or hate it, well, to be honest, it left me indifferent.In another 30 years I'll give it another try and I will let you know if my perspective changed..."
2,Extremely overrated,"I can't understand the buzz about this book. I've tried to finish it twice and failed each time due to boredom.Perhaps it is better in Spanish. Is that why people love it? Personally, I can't understand why this is considered a classic."
1,Sorry but you're out of luck,"Purchased the Omni Mount UCL-L for my 40"" LCD. I'll have to admit that the unit appears extremely sturdy and well built but it does come with one minor flaw- if a part is missing there is no way to get a replacement part. My specific issue was the bracket at the end of the arm that connects to the plate securing the display. The part was not in the box so I called Omni Mount to get a replacement part. They assured me the piece was part of the assembly when it left the factory and there was no way to get me a replacement part. I now have a $250 mount that is useless. Gotta think that if they are correct, I wound up with a used or salvaged unit."
3,Omni Mount missing part,"Omni Mount product arrived missing the plate on the end of the mounting arm. This is a key part and installation cannot complete without this. I called Omni Mount and they did not have the individual part, but sent me another complete cantilever mount at no charge. Response was good, but I had to wait an extra week for the second shipment to arrive. Installation instructions, fit and finish of the cantilever mount are very good. I am also very satisfied with how it works and looks in the room where it is installed."
2,Sturdy but difficult to install and sticks out too far,"This is a very sturdy mount. It is extremely heavy and as other reviewers have noted, it is complicated to setup. The one big drawback is how far out the TV sticks when you have the mount completely pushed in. We wound up buying another mount that sat more flush to the wall. I would recommend a different mount unless you need something this sturdy that can rotate the TV verticle."
5,"OmniMount UCL-LP Single Arm Cantilever Mount (fits 32""- 45"" flat panels)","I wanted to locate my flat panel in a difficult location. Seeing this item gave me hope that I could finally accomplish this. Although quite expensive, the price seemed reasonable compared to what was available in local stores and their even higher prices.My unit I own a 46"" flat panel, but decided to take a chance that this item would be adequate. Ordered the item and waited with baited breath. Without any inquiry or such, the mount arrived promptly as advertised. Much to my surprise, the company and up sized my order, I can only assume because of availability, to the next size.It was constructed well beyond my expectations and installed easily. The flat panel is in its new location and given me much more flexiblity with the arranging of my living room.By the way, I don't have any doubt that if they had sent exactly the item I'd order that is would have worked out just as well also."
2,Can't play the great games on this one...,"This is a good card - if you can not afford the higher priced ones. 64MB DDR, Great - but there are multiple problems with the Gamma. Most of my games need to be touched up a bit by going into the settings and putting the brightness up.I tried to play WarCraft III, Everquest, Age of Mythology and NeverWinter Nights - had problems with all of these games.If you are looking for a good card - to get by on - this is for you.If you are a heavy gamer - DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.Your best bet is to stick with any of the GeForce cards - I just purchased the Xtasy 64MB DDR GeForce 4 card - what a difference....Hope this helps..."
5,Great!,"Being very new to the Atlanta area, I needed some help finding my way around and knowing where to shop for what. This book eased my transition, and more than paid for itself."
5,Easy to understand advice about diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes is a national epidemic. Lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, are necessary to prevent complications (heart disease, stroke, vascular disease, blindness) in those with Type 2 diabetes and prevent the disease from occurring in those at high risk. Medical advice regarding diet often leaves patients confused and therefore unable to follow their advice. Kristine Napier defines Type II diabetes and the steps needed to control this disease in a way that is easy to understand. She provides advice and examples to help the reader incorporate her guidelines into their everyday life. Her 28 day guide of menus will help those get started and as always, Kris's recipes are easy to follow and delicious. Last, but not least of importance, is that all of Kris's advice is based on scientific evidence and conforms to national guidelines."
3,"Great music, dated production","The singing is exceptional, Alva, Bruscantini and Gencer really shine in their roles. Unfortunately, many scenes show a big problem this film has, that is poor coordination between the lips and the voice, which I found really annoying, and acting which seemed stilted. I think any of these singers would be great on stage, but I think the filming and trying to keep up with the soundtrack saps them of energy. Also, the costumes are really bad, they look very old TV style. This is a black and white production, which could look good with stylish costumes, but it also detracts here.If you would like to hear this great historic performance of Don Giovanni, you may want to get the audio version, I don't think this video adds any value to it."
4,A pleasant surprise,"I've been buying a fair amount of very old recordings lately, and I have enjoyed this one more than most. Will Oakland has a high, strong voice that is distinctive and almost sweet-at least on Emmett's Lullaby, Tennessee Moon, and a few of the other standouts. Unfortunately, it appears this is the only recording of his work available. Billy Murray is also a top notch singer, as on Waiting for the Robert E. Lee. The sound quality here is as good as anything prior to 1925 (these songs were recorded in 1912-1914). Basically, this is high quality barbershop quartet music with an excellent falsetto voice that often sings lead."
4,Where's/What's a gonne?,"Terry Pratchett has done it again! ""Men At Arms"" offers a laughable look at some of the biggest problems facing our world today. Prejudice, crime, anarchy, and segregation are all addressed in his unique, farcical style. This is what parody is all about! Join Corporal Carrot and the rest of the Night Watch as they encounter Trolls, Dwarves, a talking dog and gargoyles in a search for a murderer and a ""gonne."" You'll never look at the world the same way again"
2,No Footnotes?!,"I was very disappointed to find the footnotes missing from this edition. If there's a way to get to them, I couldn't find it & Pratchett's footnotes are a significant part of the humor. So buy the print version of the Discworld books - and do buy them. Prachett is always entertaining!"
4,Ordinary Discworld Novel = Very Funny,"What can I say about this novel? First, as all other discworld novels this makes me laugh. City police try to struggle against crime and anarchy. However city guards aren't such ""normal"" police. They are trolls and dwarfs, everyone with their own characteristics. This novel is easy to read and very enjoyable where ever you are."
4,First Pratchett I've read and I'm very impressed.,"A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk. Discworld is at once absurd and complex, yet held against the fabric of our reality, it's just as plausible. I'm hard pressed to think of a more likable character than Corporal Carrot. The modest anti-gun message was subtle enough to remain unobtrusive."
1,Kindle Price Too High,"Harper Collins is about to join Penguin books in the Kindle boycott.I'm was set to put my enter Pratches library on Kindle but won't when I can buy a new mass market paper back at 20% less, right here on Amazon, from an ""alternate"" seller."
2,The book itself gets 5 stars,"...but for the money, they need to do a better job with the footnotes in a Terry Pratchett book. At some point there is a bookmark that gets embedded in the text, so all following footnotes are off by one and you have to do prev page to see the right one. Also part of another footnote or 2 get embedded the same way...kind of ruins the effect."
1,HarperCollins needs to get with the times,"Why is the publisher setting the price for the Kindle version the same as the paperback? Apparently they live in some fantasy world where either paper is free, or duplicating bytes is expensive."
3,Not the Best of the Watch Sequence,"A disgruntled aristocrat steals a mysterious weapon (a rifle) from the assasin's guild and inflicts a reign of terror on Ankh-Morpork as he becomes a sniper. Features more of Carrot; Carrot and Angua get together. The minor characters (Nobby, Detritus, etc.) are also featured extensively. Has some funny and twisted material on the Clown's guild and the city's gargoyles. Not quite as tight as the others, and a bit too much of a morality play on firearms, so it gets demoted slightly, but essential if you're now hooked on the Night Watch stories."
1,Warning!,"This is a warning to other Pratchett-lovers out there looking for audiobooks. This is an abridgment of the original book, and a bad one. A lot of the best word jokes and philosophical humor is missing, many scenes are in pieces, and the whole thing simply does not convey the sense of fun and insight of the original novel. As well, in my opinion, Tony Robinson is a horribly bad voice actor, but that may simply be a personal preference. [...]"
5,Power & assasination,"Assassins, attractive werewolves, smelly talking mongrel dogs ... whats not to love!For personal reasons i can relate to Sam Vines & his continuing evolution is wonderful to watch.Now if he can just obey orders for once ... or maybe that's just not Sam."
1,Only because I can't give it 1/2 a star,"There aren't enough words in the English language to express my utter loathing and contempt for this book. I had heard that Pratchett was ""satirical"", ""devious"", ""irreverent"", ""magical"", ""entertaining"" and ""above all funny"".Sadly ""Men at Arms"" is none of the above. Pratchett is trying to be Douglas Adams and fails at it miserably. This story in particular was trite, condisending, and supremly unfunny. His use of footnotes to make a joke that had no bearing upon the story was...lame, for lack of a better term.The jokes, reeked of ""ho ho ho see how clever I am!"" rather than actually being funny. The characters struck me as pale shadows of characters who only grow and change in set and sadly predictiable ways so that they can advance the plot and story rather than being changed by the plot and story.I can't even say the story was silly lame. It wasn't. It was just lame."
5,More Morpork Night Watch Adventures!,"I love the Night Watch novels, I am reading the third at the moment, I can't stop! They are funny and surprising and introduce concepts from our world in such a way that parodies and makes a comment on society same time. This book has Leonard of Quirm (Discworld's thinly veiled version of Da Vinci) inventing a dangerous device which is ""running"" loose on the citizens of Ankh Morpork. A mystery for Captain Vimes and the Night Watch - Carrot, Colon, Nobby and the new recruits to solve - romance, intrigue and hilarity abound, I want more! Thank you amazon kindle for letting me download them instantly, this makes me very happy."
4,fine non itunes player,"For $15 the sound is surprisingly clear, the ear buds, the controls, & the # of songs (up to 500) are all fine. The item has to be clipped down otherwise it slips off. A worthwhile buy for the gym. Not for someone who needs to select which song to hear - it has two functions: random or order you loaded the songs from your computer. The big negative: your computer has to stay on for 4 hours during the initial charge; if the computer goes to sleep the player stops charging. Same for subsequent charging."
1,"Terrible product, did not work, and company unreachable.","I purchased this item for my son, and it did not work right out of the box. I followed all the terrible instructions, and it still did not work. I went to the Coby website for answers, and there was nothing there either. I then attempted over 20 tiems to contact Coby via telephone, and was never able to get through. I finally returned the product for a different bran. I STRONGLY suggest buying something else with a longer battery life. and MUCH better support and documentation."
2,Max Keebles delivers the goods,"Funny, funny funny...Unrestrained junior academic high jinks that will have your 14 year old, (and not to mention, YOURSELF) sprinting violently out of the room and into the streets screaming loud uproarious praise for this once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece. This little jem of a purchase is a must for anyonetired of the usual hollywood fair. The character of Mark is by far the biggest scene-stealer in this shining cast of adolescent thespians! I have seen the glorious future and it has a name : Hail Maximus Keeble!"
2,NOT RECOMMENDED FOR AGES 15 AND UP.,KIDS WILL LOVE IT. ADULTS WILL THINK IT'S KID'S STUFF. I CAN'T SAY I HATED IT. BUT IT'S DEFINITELY FOR THE NICKELODEON CROWD.
4,not the best,"This was an good movie, but I've seen better. It was a little overdone with the evil ice cream man who has glowing red eyes sometimes, the bully who's afraid of a little kid show character, the moneymaking ""businessman""(really a middle schooler,)and the success driven pricipal. It had it's funny parts and it's bad parts, but all in all in was an OK movie. Try it out."
4,Funny!,"This movie is about a kid who thinks he is moving to Chicago from ?So he decides to back at bullies,teachers,etc. Then it turns out he isn't moving!& that's all I can tell!Buy It!"
3,Zany but fun,"Overall this was an entertaining movie; the story lagged a few times but was redeemed by moments of hilarity and action- the opening sequence is especially cool. Alex Linz single-handedly saves the movie with his suave but mischievous character; the supporting actors aren't too bad either (""Ice-Cream Man"" and the principal of Max's school stand out).I would not recommend this movie for an older audience, neither a very young audience- preteens will probably love this flick, if my siblings are any indication. The filming, acting, and plot are hardly outstanding but are the norm for this genre of Disney movies.The movie's message may convey a sense that it's okay to cause damage to property in the name of ""justice."" Discretion on the parent's part would be advisable. It's nothing extremely serious, much the same thing kids would see on Saturday mornings. It really depends on your family and what you view as acceptable."
4,THE USUAL SUSPECTS,"MY KIDS AND I LOVED THE MOVIE. IT'S YOUR USUAL KID OVERCOMING HIS FEARS AND BEATING THE BULLY STORY, BUT IT IS FUNNY. I THINK I MAY HAVE ENJOYED MORE THAN MY KIDS."
5,Max s Keeble s big move,I jut enjoy this movie the boy that plays robe the actor is Josh Peck from Drake and Josh show. In my dvd box it had a big picture.
4,Killer Funny,"I am not persay a huge fan of kids movies, but this one had me falling over laughing. The kids in this movie are just hillarious, the story with the evil principal is totally worth seeing. Even being a so called grown up, I would watch this over and over and over again! Get it, you will love it as will your kids!"
5,Strong Medicine,I love this show!! I am VERY DISAPOINTED that the other seasons are not for sale. Shouldnt they be by now? I would buy all of them and be proud to add them to my movie collection.
4,Strong Medicine first season,"Good drama, good sense of humor. It has serious topics but doesn't get too preachy or stuffy. Down to earth characters that are real and very likable. I wish it was still going, House can be a little too cold sometimes."
5,Just as described,"The package came and the item was just as described, new in the shrink wrap. Plays perfectly. Two thumbs up!"
4,Almost perfect,"I read this book as part of an MBA module. I didnt know anything about Activity Based Costing at the time and so the book was a little difficult since it was not meant to be an introduction to the subject. After I did some research and became more familiar with the material, I realised how great this book is. I have read it twice. The book is well structured and the authors use plenty of real life case studies. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is that I would have rather seen a large section at the end of the book with more detailed information about the case studies. I read some Harvard case studies that were mentioned in the text and it was really helpful because they put things in perspective. I think the authors should have included two or three case studies with their analysis at the end of the book. Other than that, I dont think that there is a better book about the subject out there."
4,Well...,"When it all comes down to comparing ""Accelerator"" with other FSOL works, it becomes apparent that the same ratings systems cannot be used. Afterall, ""Accelerator"" is FSOL's most accessable album, something which appeals both to hardcore FSOL fans, and the average techno-loving Joe who may not be into the whole ""Ambient-Trance"" genre which FSOL's ""LifeForms"" basically defined. And where ""LifeForms"" is full of natural sounds and music which is hypnotic and almost not music at all, ""Accelerator"" is full instead of beats, structure, and the usual odd sound clips which are thrown in on occaison to add variety. And while this does make it a good album, it is not FSOL's best; rating third, after ""LifeForms"" and ""Dead Cities""."
4,Future,"Despite being released at the turn of the 90's, 'Accelerator' sounds less old-fashioned nowadays than either 'FSOL' or 'LifeForms', and if they are remembered for anything it will be 'Papua New Guinea', their mixture of dub bass, breakbeats and Dead Can Dance. A well-balanced halfway-house between intelligent techno and ambient, 'Accelerator' is frequently gorgeous, and extremely nostalgic. In 1992, it seemed as if intelligent electronic dance music would precipitate an irreversible shift in musical culture, and although FSOL didn't leave much of a legacy, this makes Basement Jaxx doubly pitiable."
3,Not the future of sound,"I bought this record when I started getting into Orbital and other techno groups. I'd heard that this was a classic album but when I listened to it I realised that it wasn't for me. ""Expander"" and ""Papua New Guinea"" are pretty good tunes if you're into industrial techno, but they don't make an album. ""Accelerator"" isn't very accessable, especially if you've never heard any FSOL before, and it's a bit shallow and lifeless, I recommend ""We have explosive"" to anyone interested in FSOL. This album isn't bad but it's probably best to avoid it unless you are a fan."
2,Lacklustre with the exception of Papua New Guinea,"I decided to pick this up after hearing Lifeforms, and hearing several great things about ""Papua New Guinea"". Believe the hype about ""Papua New Guinea!"" It's a mid-tempo ambient house masterpiece that has aged marvelously. The rest of the album however, is just kind of blah. FSOL try their hand at up-tempo acid house, and the results are mediocre at best. Some tunes are decent if unmemorable (""Calcium"" and ""Expander""), but most are just cheesy and un-catchy.And while the album as a whole is lackluster, you still need to hear ""Papua New Guinea"", which can be done either by purchasing this album, or one of the two single releases for the song (of which Translations appears to be the better of). That song alone is worth the price."
2,"Futuristic sound effects, no steady beat","This is not an album to dance to, nor is it one to work-out to. There is no steady beat/musical-rhyme to this album (except for Papua New Guinea, which is the saving grace of this album in my opinion). I can't seem to fit this music to any mood, so unfortunately I have to rate it down."
5,"Future Sound Of London, The - Accelerator","Accelerator. If you don't have this album, you don't know anything about electronic music. It's a classic through-and-through. Although it may sound slightly dated, it still stands head-and-shoulders above most techno albums today. With impressive range, from the moody ""While Others Cry"" and the trance-forerunner ""Calcium"" to the nu-industrial of ""Central Industrial"" and the storming ""Moscow,"" Accelerator still is a great listen. This re-release also includes 10 mixes of ""Papua New Guinea,"" a title that should inspire devotion among all fans of electronic music. Blue States does its usual downtempo magic on the track, while Simian makes it sound like the carnival from hell. Hybrid (of course) adds some hard breaks, while Satoshi Tomiie makes some dark house. Some good mixes, but do they hold up to the original? What do you think the answer is?"
4,If Plastikman had a child with The Orb...,"This disc single-handedly changed my perceptions of modern dance music. Though I originally bought the CD for its ""alright"" techno tracks (It's Not My Problem, Moscow, Calcium) I slowly warmed up to the more adventurous songs, especially Papua New Guinea. For those who haven't heard the song let me tell you...YOURE MISSING OUT BIG TIME!!! Other good tracks are Expander, Central Industrial, and the remixes."
4,Friels Greatest Play,This is set in play format with a strange inclusion of the antagonists alter ego the two characters are Public the man everyone sees and Private the man no one sees or hears only Public can hear him. Together they make up Gar. The play is set the night before Gar is set to leave Ireland and move to Philadelphia. The story focuses not on his leaving but more on his escape from his unexciting father. The inclusion of Private Gar added humour and explanation of events in the play. An enjoyable play with greats dialog and a good story.
3,outdated,"This book is mini and light in weight, but it was first published in the 80's, so a lot of the phrases are kindda out dated. I bought this book when I went to study in Sweden for 2 years, and that is not how young people speak anymore. But the vocabulary is still usefull."
2,Helpful ? Not so much,"Myself being a second (father's side)and third generation (mother's side)Swedish-American, I find the suggested pronunciations to be inaccurate. Some of the sounds described in this book are not as my parents tried to teach me.Disappointed in Dallas."
2,Be warned!,"This collection of the entire Canterbury Tales (""translated"" -- how can English be ""translated"" into English? ""transposed"" or ""recast"" into Modern English is a more accurate way of putting it)is clearly and gracefully read by a variety of readers. BUT there is no accompanying Table of Contents, nor are the tales in the conventional order, so one has to search through 17 CD's in order to find a specific tale. I'd send it back if I hadn't torn the wrapper open -- which I had to do in order to discover this serious deficiency."
3,Canterbury Tales,I indeed ordered Canterbury Tales as a gift for my daughter. There were many options as to the style of book available. I specifically searched for something appearing a little older or different that was a hardcover and especially liked the idea it was cloth covered...that sold me on this item. When it arrived however it was hardcover but not cloth covered; rather paper covered that looks like cloth on the actual print. That was very disappointing...if I had of known I would not have placed this order.
1,Kindle-Version of Bantam Classics un-readable,"I was looking for a well-structured side-by side version of the Canterbury Tales. Bantam Classics normally does a great jobs on books, but whoever transcribed it to kindle did not know kindle at all, left it unstructured and the translation all over the place, intermingled with the lines, translating the wrong verses and generally just all over the place.Practically, I am reading four lines middle-english, five lines modern, three lines middle-english, 2 lines modern, 6 lines middle-english, and so forth. There is no connection between the middle-English and its translation.That was a wasted 5.99 USD for kindle version and a HUGE disappointment :( ..."
5,"The Canterbury Tales, Reviewed by Philip Moore","Have you ever sat amongst friends, or maybe even strangers, and swapped stories with each person attempting to make their tale appear to be the most impelling. This is in essence the design of Geoffrey Chauncer's ""Canterbury Tales"", a collection of stories told by a group of travelers on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Of these stories the most noted are ""The Knight's Tale"", ""The Wife of Bath's Tale"", ""The Miller's Tale"", ""The Reeve's Tale"", and ""The Parson's Tale"". Chaucer, born in the early 1340s (the exact date is unknown), lived a most notable life and had a profound impact on English literature. Much of his works are influenced by love and his distain for the Church in the form of satirical humor. The latter due impart to the corruption within the clergy and the condition of the people from their suffering of drought, famine, and disease. Chaucer's work brought to light a new age of literature full of wit, comedy, and daily life."
4,Nice introduction to the world of Chaucer,"Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales are nothing short of genius and one of the few glimpses we have into 14th century life today. Romance, Comedy, Adventure and Fantasy - there should be something here to amuse everyone.If you're a little to intimidated by the original Middle-English version then this is the book for you. My suggestion is to read this version first, then get a copy in the original Middle-English and read that."
4,He writes with ink and parchment...,"I bought this book after reading the Pardoner's tale in my High School English class. It's wonderful, and the translation is great, not to mention that Chaucer is one of the best writers of all time. I think that I may slightly prefer Shakespeare, but not by much.. and many of the tales have things in them that I didn't think people even would dare talk about hundreds of years ago.. that was really cool. I will definitely read this book again, when I'm in the mood for it. ^_^"
4,Depicts every level of 14th century England.,"Thoroughly interesting. The organization of this book must of been very creative for the time. A group consisting of everyone from a cook to a knight set out on a religios pilgrimage to Canterbury. A humorous tavern owner suggests a way to help pass the time, everyone tells a story, and the persone who tells the best story gets a free dinner. The stories range from serious tales about chivalry and love (knight) to the disgusting and perverse (summoner). Apparently Chaucer planned to have each member of the party tell two tales, but I suppose he didn't get around to finishing the collection. Also, I think 1 or 2 of the stories are not complete, but that's in every edition you can buy."
1,bad version to read,"The annotation style if this edition ruins it. Putting the definitions of words in line with the text, rather than as footnotes or end notes, disrupts the flow of reading. It quickly gets confusing as to what is original text and what is editorial comment. I'm off to find another edition only partway into the first poem."
5,A wondeful set of tales which define an era,"Clearly, during Chaucer's time, the english language was looked down on as inderior by the other languages of Europe. The Canterbury tales were important because of the use of the venacular language of england. It represents our first look into our language."
2,Too bad I bought this book.,"I find it very unfortunate that I wasted my money on this book when I could have read the entire story on the Internet. Of course, the story is out of copyright, and you'll find it all over the Internet, in complete.Don't waste your money like I did. Even worse, I never even read the book.My rating is only on the size of the book, because like I said, I never read it, and I am forced to issue a rating (I only wanted to enter a comment)."
2,A Good Translation but still disappointed,"This version of the Canterbury Tales in modern English is brilliant. Nonetheless I was deeply disappointed in finding that the Parson's Tale was omitted completely, the reason being that ""it does not interest the general public"". I disagree with such a sweeping statement."
3,Chaucer created modern English as we know it.,"Every English-speaker should read Chaucer. As Dante did for Italian, Chaucer did for English - making the English vernacular an accepted language to write literature with, standardizing usages by inspiring imitation, and making up or adopting literally hundreds upon hundreds of words into the language. Chaucer is where old English ends and Middle English begins.This translated version is okay if you just want to get the story out of the tales, but if you find you like Chaucer even the smallest bit I would strongly urge you to try reading the original Middle English. It honestly is not all that hard if you give it any effort at all and you will be richly rewarded - Chaucer's poetry is simply breathtaking. This translation is decent, but know that you are missing half the show."
1,Don't buy the Kindle edition,"This is not easy to read in Kindle format. In paperback, it has two translations: one in Middle English, the other in Modern English. These are displayed side by side, with the earlier English on the left, Modern on the right. When it comes to the Kindle edition, there are no breaks between these translations. It switches back and forth without any notice, making it really difficult to follow. It would be alright if we could view it page by page (in it's original format), but without that option it's harder to understand. (Yes, it's obvious which part is which, but finding where it stops and starts takes away from the reading experience. It's too choppy.)In short, buy the paperback or perhaps a different Kindle edition. The format makes this a challenge to read."
5,The Hobo Philosopher,"I suppose that any freshman college student has read some of these Tales. I had a professor who read a few of them to us in the Olde English. It was really fun and you really got a grasp of where the English language was coming from - and poetry.I went on from my English class and read the whole works. They are good, classic short stories. You are really going back to the basics here. The stories are all easy to read and are about the everyday type people and their everyday lives. You get classic English literature, history, short story writing techniques, and the roots of the English language all in one medium sized book. Can't beat it. It's a bargain.Richard EdwardNoble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:""A Summer with Charlie"""
4,A good translation.,"The Canterbury Tales is my very favorite book. I personally enjoy the original Middle English version and would highly suggest it to all who are interested in it. (I purchased a 1929 copy of Everyman's Library Series The Canterbury Tales from my favorite used bookstore.) Though I have read my Everyman's Library version so many times I can repeat many sections word for word, I also own Nevill Coghill's translation and it is delightful. It is one of the best translations of the book which I have read. I, of course, would suggest reading it in Middle English, but if you are frusturated or confused by the language then I would recommend this translation. It sticks closely to the feeling that you get from Chaucer's original text. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the Middle English version will always hold the number one spot in my heart."
4,You won't get bored often.,"This book is more a collection of short stories. Many of them are very funny, there was only one that I found my self getting bored with."
5,Excellent,"The first story ""The Knight's Tale"" is on par with ""Aucassin and Nicolette"" (Andrew Lang), and The Friendship of ""Amis and Amile"" (Old French Romances, William Morris, which can usually be bought through Alibris as a used book put out by (...)) In my own opinion ""The Knight's Tale"" is the only reason to purchase or read The Canterbury Tales. It is unmatched if heard on audio book,Blackstone Audiobook, unabridged, read by Fred Williams, ISBN: 0-7861-2239-0.(I purchased mine at audio books on cassette.)"
4,easy to fallow!,"I remember reading this book my soph. yer in high school and sruggling a lot with the translation. But with this addition it is so much easier to fallow. His stories represent one of the motliest crews in English literature: the Wife of Bath who has put away five husbands and is looking for a sixth; the pardoner, the reeve, the clerk, and the knight. THe Millers tale is absolutely histerical and will crack you up. Hope you enkoy reading this book as much as i did."
3,i like it,"it was very nice and in good shape, it was old but i expected that. it was also a very good price. i enjoyed it."
3,"Chaucer was banned in Lake City, Florida schools...","If you want to read a fascinating account of how a classic can be banned, take a look at Claudia Johnson's STIFLED LAUGHTER. A rousing true-life story of the battle against provincialism in the town of Lake City, Florida when the religious right decided Chaucer was too bawdy and crude for their high school seniors."
3,From a middle school kid's point of view,For a middle school kid I thought that The Chanterbury Tales wasn't that great of a book. The complex language and all the boring discussions made the book really dull. Some of the stories were far better then others. Happy Reading
3,Not the complete Canterbury Tales,"Please note: The Bantam version (translated by Hieatt) only contains the most popular of the Tales. (Use the ""Inside this Book"" feature to check the table of contents, as I, alas, did not.) The facing page translation is just what I was looking for, but really wanted the complete set."
5,great book,Well written and beautifully illustrated. A good introduction to Chaucer for young and old. A very good winter read indeed..
5,A Fine Edition of A Brilliant Play,"*****Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"" are timeless. The tales (mostly in verse, although some are in prose) are told as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from Southwark to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. These stories paint pictures of medieval life, theology, and culture.And this edition is most preferable to me. I highly recommend it!*****"
4,Chaucer appeals to everyone,"The Canterbury Tales is so appealing due to it's diverseness. Chaucer was involved with every level of society during his time. This is shown with how the characters are so well-rounded. The short, but insightful description of the travelers is also helpful in picturing this group riding on thier way to the shrine of Becket. A great book everyone should read, but one of those you have to be in the mood for. Also don't expect a continuing theme or story, but short stories that sometimes leaves you hanging."
4,Very Good,The Canterbury Tales is the chronicle of a contest. A storytelling contest between pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. This is probably the best translation I have read. It does have some downfalls the author excluded some of the tales including the Parson's tale which is actually meant to be a conclusion(Chaucer died before he could finish the tales). Other than that the book is very good. It does break some myths and sterotypes we have about people of that time and some of the stroies are rather humorous and could still be considered humorous in todays society.
3,Tedious reading,"When I read this, back in high school, my English teacher pumped it up so much beforehand, I was expecting a hilarious, rollicking fun read.Boy was I disappointed. We read the maybe slightly updated version from the 'olde english' and the main part of the struggle was figuring what the hell was going on. Then, when you finally figured it out, it was something maybe KIND OF funny, in a satirical yet also juvenile way. It basically takes you an hour to decode that once again, some miller is cheating on his wife, with, oh, say a goat.If you want a 'difficult read,' I would say read existentialism. The payoff at the end of the road, which is usually some ""biting"" social commentary like 'anti-semitism is bad' isn't worth the pain of ploughing through all the weird spellings and antique words."
2,"Wait long enough and anything becomes a ""classic""","Here is the lesson to be learned: write a few dirty stories, wait a few hundred years and everyone will say you are a genius and that what you wrote is classic. Really, there is nothing in Chaucer that I don't hear in any locker room of any local gym. Why is this stuff taught in classrooms? Because tenured professors think if it is written in middle english it must be some revelation into life. The same could be said of any anecdote told by any average joe, if only they would take it just as seriously."
2,For Simpsons fans.,"If you like the television series ""The Simpsons,"" you will probably like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. They reflect the same vulgar approach to entertainment which, instead of making us rise above the gutter of everyday life, brings us to the lowest level of crudity. There are some redeeming tales however, such as the Knight's Tale, but as a whole, this book should be avoided by anyone with a sense of honour and decency."
4,Classic,"In order to understand English litterature and the English language, many have read, or at least tried to read, Chaucers ""Canterbury Tales"". I too did begin (and sort of finished) the work in Middle English, which is not as hard as one might be lead to think, but is quite labourious and painstakingly slow at times. With this version, a great compromise has been found, translating it as true to the original as possible yet in modern English. I know that every time you make a rewrite or translation, things are lost, but sometimes it is necessary, or just quite convenient. This is one of those times.It is great fun reading the Canterbury Tales. The structure of the work makes it very accesible and easy to pick up after some time away. You could treat it as a whole entity or as a collection of short stories centered around a group of persons on a pilgrimage. One of the books that any decent home library shouldn't be without."
2,transliteration makes lao even more complex than it is,"The Lonely Planet phrasebooks are usually a great help travelling around the world. This one however turned out to be creating more problems than solving them. The transliteration is so weird that you actually have to learn two new languages before pronouncing anything closely right. I tried the book with several english speaking lao persons and lao speaking native english speakers while travelling around the country and all had problems with the transliteration. Nothing is like you would naturally pronounce it. For example who would say Khoj if you see Khawy?Helpful is the lao bit so you can point, in the end its how I got around. A pity, there are much better transliterations around."
2,No Lao-to-English!,"This phrasebook looks reasonable in most respects, but it has no Lao to English dictionary. That means, if you are trying to communicate with someone who does not speak english, they cannot respond to you with words, even if they are motivated and patient enough to try to carry on a conversation.The description of this book said it had a ""comprehensive dictionary"". Unfortunately, it only has half of a comprehensive dictionary. If you want a book that will make it possible to actually converse with a Lao speaker, this is not it."
5,Magnificent,"This movie is excellent on its own, but absolutely extraordinary when paired with its sequel, Manon of the Spring. I highly reccomend the two as a pair to anyone considering either."
3,This should be sold in the same box with Manon of the Spring,"I saw this film, and thought that it was good - but not as good as the effusive praise heaped upon it. So, I did not see the sequel.Then, someone I know with excellent taste said ""Wait a minute - trust me, you MUST see the sequel.""Well, I took his advice, and just finished watching the sequel ""Manon of the Spring"" (Manon des Sources). Together, they are an excellent film that I would give 4+ stars.The first film, ""Jean de Florette"" is really only half a film.This is really a ""two disk set"" and perhaps financial considerations forced the film maker to split it into two normal length films, instead of one long one. But, be prepared to watch both.Also, I should echo another reviewer's comment that it is not light and cheerful entertainment, but rather an honest look at how we should treat each other and why."
3,jean de florette,The story is wonderfully simple told in typical French style withfocus on the characters strengths and weaknesses. It deserves 5 stars. I downgraded because the dvd was from a Korean supplierdone in letterbox with no options.
3,People seriously liked this movie?,"I saw this movie in my high school English class. I was very surprised to see that it had come out on video. I remember wondering what happened next. Now that I know the name of the movie, I can get the sequel. Even though I'm curious to find out the rest of the story, I wouldn't rate this as the greatest movie of all time. Still, if you don't have anything better to do, watch it. It is interesting, and it has its comical, and sad moments."
5,EXCELLENT FILM/A MUST SEE,"IN ANSWER TO THE FIRST REVIEW ABOUT THIS MOVIE, MOST PEOPLE (IN THE UNITED STATES) ARE REALLY IGNORANT OF WHAT GOOD FILMS ARE ALL ABOUT. THEY ARE BLINDED BY TODAY'S ""HOLLYWOOD"" INDUSTRY WHICH IS LESS THAN PERFECT, TO SAY THE LEAST...EVERYONE...: DO YOURSELFS A FAVOR: START WATCHING MORE FOREIGN FILMS..., MOST OF THEM ARE NOT PRETENTIOUS, NOT SHALLOW, NOT HOLLYWOOD..., EVERYONE MIGHT LEARN A THING OR TWO.GREAT FILM, FULL OF GOOD CONTENT AND MEANING!!!"
2,Wonderful Movie...Bad Transfer,"Since purchasing a DVD player a year and a half ago, I have often come across reviews that bemoan the ""transfer quality"" of a particular title. Now...I know what they are talking about.While this is one of my all-time favorite movies, I was extremely disappointed in the picture and sound quality. Film grain is evident throughout and at times the highlight values of the picture seem overexposed.I give the movie 5 stars. I give the ""transfer"" 1 star. Since this is not likely to be re-released as a ""Special Edition"" I would reluctantly recommend buying this title, only because it will have a longer shelf life than the VHS edition."
5,A must-see movie,"Truly, this is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is a realistic story that has made it possible for me to see how one thinks and how one acts in life, and how everything has its reason in the end. Highly recommended movie, Cheers, Branko Miros"
2,Too expensive to not offer carry handle/strap,"Jacket is good to just protect your portfolio, but a handle and/or strap would be helpful to carry your portfolio."
1,Looking for a great book on Titanic? Don't look here!,"I study Titanic and try to get every book possible on Titanic,( I've been studying Titanc, way before the movie was made). But when I bought this book and read it, I regreted it. It's a good book, for... how shall I say it, Beginner readers for Titanic. I give this book, in my opinion, 1 STAR because of it's lack of thought. The book seemed like it was made for new Titanic fans. Since I've been interested in Titanic for a long while, this book wasn't at all great."
2,The only reason I give it 2 stars is.......,"The fact that this book is about Titanic (well sort of anyway). This book is not a true work of history. The research is faulty, the words and thoughts of the various characters is bogus fiction. After being a student of Titanic history for almost 40 years, this is a book that I have dismissed lightly, very lightly. If you want to know Titanic and the disaster that befell her, this is not the book."
1,Tedious and Self-Inflating,"I'm always up for another look at the Titanic, especially if new light is shed on the story. Unfortunately, Pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person, or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of Ballard's expeditions. On top of that, it's not interesting. The retelling of the events on the ship are fine, but they can't carry the deadweight of Pelligrino's attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story. It's the literary equivalent to watching an actor talk about how moved they are by their own acting. PASS."
2,Not the best,"I have studied Titanic for many years, starting way before James Cameron's film. Many of the ""facts"" presented in this work go against those given by tons of other authors and explorers of Titanic. The author seems very full of himself, trying to give himself credit where he doesn't deserve it. It almost seems as if he is trying to convince everyone that he was a co-discoverer of Titanic and Robert Ballard's best friend. I would recommend another author, one who actually has a love for Titanic and isn't trying to make himself look better."
2,"Contrary to other reviews, I found this book hard to read.","After reading glowing reviews of this book on Amazon.com, I purchased it and eagerly awaited its arrival. I first read ""A Night to Remember,"" and couldn't put it down. This book, on the other hand, has been difficult to stick with. The author just doesn't seem to know quite what he wants to write about. He goes back and forth between the actual sinking (very interesting, but most of this stuff can be found in Lord's book), the discovery of the ship (which includes a great deal of very technical dialogue), and the Challenger explosion (perhaps this connection is a bit of a stretch). As someone who has become very interested in the subject of the Titanic (as a result of the movie), I found this book disappointing. The author seemed more interested in letting us know how involved he was, personally, in the entire expedition, but that just didn't interest me. Nice try, but no cigar."
4,Very emotional...,"Dear readers, This book was definitly worth reading. Not only does it give information about the finding of the "" Unsinkable Ship "", there is also a story going on at the same time about her fateful night. I have to tell you though, it's heart-wrenching and emotional at times. Some of the information it gives is about the machines used to find the TITANIC, and stuff like that. That was a little hard to understand for me, and it probably would also for young children. I hope you enjoy this book, as you go back to the TITANIC."
5,Tears for the Masses,"This book made me cry for alot of reasons. But mostly for the humanity. It the dozens of books that I have read on Titanic, none compares to this one. I liked the author to know that I hate him for it and love him for it just the same. He ruined my day with the harsh reality and changed my life with it's inspiration. Thomas Andrews would be amazed. Oh yes, he would be utterly amazed. -Jaime N. Rinne/Titanic Historian"
5,Enlightening and spell binding,"I read Titanic in the early part of 1997. I found the book fascinating, especially to one who knew very little of the disaster and the uncovering of the broken ship. I have recommended the book as a must read to many of my friends. Skip the movie and read the book!"
2,its too drown out,Birthright uses the battle system rules that are o.k. but they are not as fun as doing a mass battle by group.
2,Lodge Book,For the price of the book I was looking for more recipes not a history of cast iron cooking. Not worth the price
2,the complete book of dutch oven cooking,this book spends too much time on history and stories. beginners need to know how to determine the temperature of the oven. advanced cooks may know how many coals to put on and under but charcoal is better to learn with.twelve chapters of history and differances of cast iron and aluminum is too drawn out. the final blow is when there are only 19 recipes and most do not appeal to me.
5,a pleasant reminder of the British Invasion,"Listeners of this cd will be reminded that, in the era of just three guitars and a drummer, the British Invasion provided a pleasant change from American sounds in the early 1960s. The sound quality of this cd is remarkable. On ""Don't Throw Your Love Away"" you can actually hear someone in the studio rustling some papers at the very start of the song. The opening drum riff on ""Needles and Pins"" will stir the blood of any Mersey listener. This album is nothing but pop....but pure, straight and beautiful pop it is with jingle jangle guitars and high harmonies covering songs that strongly hint of a lost era of innocence. Either you love this stuff ...or you don't!"
2,A selection---we need a complete set of all they did.,"The Searchers are still touring and I saw them last year in Bay Shore, new York state. This album here is fine, BUT the group's work is much more worth getting INTO. We need the biggest most complete set possible. It is hard to get new listeners to hear some of their best songs: The World is Waiting for Tomorrow, Lovers Will, All a Dream, Till I Met You, and so many more. Buy this if it's the best in your price range and then join the groups on the web where you can expand your Searchers appreciation! And don't forget to read Frank Allen's memoir of the group's history. It's fun!"
3,The Searchers Greatest Hits,"There are a handful of really great songs on this cd that are classic rock-n-roll gotta-have-a-copy hit songs. The rest, however, seemed to me to be no more than ""filler"" quality songs added to complete a full album back in its recording day--now the cd equivalent of an album. I can't believe that any of those lesser-known songs could really rate as being among the Searchers' greatest hits."
4,Very funny stand up comedy.,"I've been a fan for Lee Evans for a while and his Live in Scotland DVD is one of his best, not the best just one of. Not too long and not too short, Lee Evans punches out hilarious jokes and sketches with perfect timing and comedic ease. Lee Evans delivers tear jerking laughter while using everyday occurences and impersonations of unknown common people as his subject matter. This DVD is a perfect example of what kind of comedian Evans is. Using physical comedy mixed with voice acting and clever stories, Lee's performance will but a smile on anyones face.A highly recommended comedy DVD from one of Britains most successful and treasured comedians."
1,"Extremely cheap and poorly constructed, DO NOT BUY!","Everything about this scooter is incredibly cheap and shoddily put together. The seat broke under my weight (I weigh 165, well below the stated limit for this product) and half of the bolts holding the scooter together rattled themselves off within a few blocks of riding it. Do not, under any circumstances, waste your money on this inferior product."
2,this scooter it only for kids scooter only 4 weeks,"I am 22 years old men and i bought this scooter for the speed by ivoog scooters for 400 dollars with free shipping, and i like it,i have this scooter two months with problems, and the only big problem is that the wheels are very small to enjoy the ride safety,controller will stop working and then the company will leave you will not help ,and will tell you what could we do.and it not comfortable because it do not have any shocks so i do not recommend it all for adults that need to ride long trip,so adults for you good do not buy any xtreme scooters they are for kids you be not happy if you buy it.i bought the ezip 1000 scooter this is the best of the best scooter, with the x500 scooter i am 140 lb i ride 17+MPH and with ezip 1000 i ride with the top speed of 16+MPH and it fille really like 20MPH, and its very very comfortable so this for you adult you will love it and you be very very happy with it you see...."
1,Dull and Annoying,"A small town girl who comes to the city to become a star is a premise as old as the cinema. Coyote Ugly is just repeating this, with a particularly annoying character who suffers from one of the most demented looking cases of stage fright I've ever seen.Jerry Bruckheimer usually does good films, but this is a case in which I would love to ask him what he was thinking. The only attraction to this film is a bunch of girls dancing on top of the bar, and the singing of LeAnn Rimes. He could easily have just made a few music videos and dispensed with the vehicle for presenting them. It would have done us all a favour."
3,"Coyote Ugly ""Extended Cut"" Review","Piper Perabo is an aspiring songwriter who moves to New York City to follow her dreams. Having trouble getting her foot in the door, she ends up working at a wild bar where the female patrons dance around on the bar in wet T-shirts to cheesy cheerleader anthems. John Goodman turns in an enjoyable performance as Perabo's overprotective father. Those expecting an edgier and more adult-oriented version of ""Coyote Ugly"" with its new ""unrated cut"" may want to save their money. With the exception of an added sex scene involving Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia (Perabo's nude shots were filmed with a ""double""), the movie is still ""PG-13"" country. It's the same sexually-suggestive but far from edgy content you'll find in the theatrical cut."
5,Who Said Coyotes Weren't Interesting?,"Classic genre - underdog trying to make her dreams come true.. A sexy story that surprising ends well..Violet moves to the big city in the hopes of taking her writing career to the next level.. Reality check has her desperate for work in a city where no one ever listens..Coyote Ugly - possibly the sexiest club man has ever seen (a modern day Moulin Rouge) - Enter the young - innocent -inexperienced Violet.. Will she fit into the world of the ""Coyotes""??..Cameo appearence by country singing sensation LeAnn Rimes - Little unknown fact - LeAnn provided all the vocals performances for Violet.. Piper apparently can't sing - but boy can she act!5 Stars.. :D .. An Excellent Sexy movie.. :D"
5,Coyote Ugly ROCKS!!!!,"I thought that Coyote Ugly was an awesome movie. Piper Perabo has great talent and should be given or sought out for more roles. This movie is a definite must see, as well as, a must have. The music for the movie was right on, although I would have loved to hear Piper's voice on more of the songs. She is definite STAR material... :-)"
4,Piper is NOT Ugly!,"Coyote Ugly is a sexy ""feel good"" movie. We get a nice introduction to Piper Perabu, who may well be the next Alicia Silverstone or Cameron Diaz. It is basically a story of a naive girl from New Jersey who comes to New York to persue her dream as a singer/songwriter.When she realizes that she isn't going to be an instant success, she takes a job in club with the title name. Her dancing skills improve and her fear of perfoming in front of crowds starts to diminish. She incidentally meets a nice young man whom she starts seeing, and though there are troubles, her move to the top is going strong by the end of the movie.The plot is very predictable, but the acting is well above average. It was nice to see of movie of this genre with relatively little foul language. I don't believe the ""F"" word was used at all. All in all, a nice and enjoyable movie that is suitable for most members of the family. I recommend it."
2,Can&#65533;t fight the moonlight&#65533;,"Okay, I'm a sucker for John Goodman, and he's by far the sexiest in the cast. I'll admit that I enjoyed the movie mainly because (a) I did not actually pay for the rental, and (b) I was consuming large amounts of alcohol at the time. To the film's credit, even in my drunken stupor I could tell that the scenes in which Piper pretends to sing were incredibly corny. I think I remember falling off the sofa and landing on my head from the extreme cheese-ness. You know? The kind that makes your skin crawl?In true Bruckheimer form, Leanne Rimes organizes a high-speed train robbery which results in a spectacular car wreck involving two commercial airliners and the Seattle Space Needle... but I don't want to spoil it for anybody. See it for yourself (read: do not see this for yourself). Two stars."
2,pure formula junk,"This is the kind of film I get stuck watching on long plane rides and would NEVER seek myself. It is such silly schlock that I marvel at how the Hollywood mill can churn these things out and make money - it's really an industrial production process, geared to superficial viewers.This is one of the basic plots. THe others include crippled boy, whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk, love, or talk. Why do we keep watching this junk? A video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome.OK, here goes: beautiful girl with a dream, seeking big break, gets gig in a bar, handles it, meets boy who doesn't fit into plans, shakes it, shakes it more, shakes it a lot more, flirts with corruption, stays course, makes real friends, gets to know real self, grows. Oh, and then succeeds on her own terms.Not recommended. Admittedly, the acting in not abysmal, but what a waste of time about lives that could never exist."
1,Hate widescreen format,"Loved the movie, bought the dvd and its in widescreen, its terrible. My favorite scenes, dance on the bar, all you can see is their middle, not faces and feet at the same time. It's not the same would rather have a TV cut format."
1,I want my money back,"This movie is Flashdance with no flash, a Saturday Night fever on a Wednesday afternoon happy hour. The main character is cute, but annoying. The bar atmosphere with all the dancing is stupid, and the plot is written for some afternoon school special. Save your money and treat yourself to a Big Mac meal. It will go down easier than the characters in this movie."
2,Boring,My friend likes this movie so I checked it out. I didn't like it. Kind of boring. Couldn't get through the whole thing. Fastforward solved the problem :)
3,My take on Coyote Ugly,"When saw this movie with a big group of people, the reception was mixed. My take is that it's as light and easy-to-swallow as a souffle. It's fairly cute, occasionally clever, occasionally bad, never tries to reach for a level of dramatic depth, and succeeds within its own limitations. The story is fairly hackneyed but painlessly rendered. Violet (Piper Perabo) moves to New York to become a singer-songwriter, instead finding herself as a provacative bartender at the Coyote Ugly bar, whilst falling in love with an Australian fry cook (Adam Garcia). I prefer this movie infinitely over other Jerry Bruckheimer creations. It is much better than Flashdance, a similar-themed story.True the acting isn't Oscar-worthy and some of the dialogue falls flat, but what was this movie trying to do? Entertain. And it succeeds enormously.A guilty pleasure.(extra note: this DVD provides one of the most entertaining commentary tracks with the cast doing a relay on each scene with joyful glee)."
2,This Coyote Is No Genius,"The usual Girl Goes To The Big City cliches, not as bad as what you'd expect from Mr. Bruckheimer, thanks to the lovely and charismatic Ms. Perabo and a nice performance from Mr. Goodman as ""Dad""...still, a gal who aspires to write songs and has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAY. That whole Whitney/Mariah thing, yecch.The bar scenes have a certain energy to 'em, but the other coyotes apparently have no hopes and dreams (or personalities).Here's hoping the adorable Piper will get a great or even better movie in the near future. I will definitely be following her career."
4,Entertaining,I like this movie. I think it is entertaining. I wanted to have this movie in dvd and add it to my collection.
5,"-""spectacular...""",- This is just a brilliant movie which combines o lot of aspects in youth problemacy..! -I really love this movie....!
5,Love it,"I love this movie, we had it on VHS and then our VHS player died so had to replace it with this. Works great."
5,gift for husband,"my husband loves this movie, so I bought it for him as a christmas present to add to his dvd collection"
3,Chicks dancing on a bar..,"Nuff said. It's kinda sappy at times, but a fun movie to watch. And every scene John Goodman is in definitely makes up for the sap."
3,Fast shipping but...,"The package came sooner than expected and I was happy to get it then :)However...The movie was pretty scratched, it was so disappointing :( not just a little scratched, I couldn't really enjoy it and it's one of my favorite movies"
5,CoYoTe UgLy MoViE rEviEw,"this is definitely more of a chick flick than a guy movie! in all honesty though, its a GREAT movie. although geared more towards younger girls, i'm sure anyone could enjoy this movie! its just an all out great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone!"
4,Movie of Ambitions,"This is a great movie, one of the best i have seen in a while. It is full of ambition, a young girl who finds a job at the Bar Coyote Ugly, and it is not just a bar job, but her boss if living out her dream and gives her the courage to fullfil her own dreams. Full of laughts with a great ending."
4,A feel-good movie.,"Piper Perabo as an exhibitionist with stage fright? Okay, so you can't just suspend your disbelief with this movie, you have to hang it up in the back closet and forget it even exists for two hours. But the beer flows freely, there's lots of T&A for the guys and nipples-and-ripples for the ladies, and there's a highly improbable but very satisfying cameo by LeAnn Rimes belting out ""Can't Fight the Moonlight,"" a song that, come to think of it, is as slight yet satisfying as this movie is.I won't go into the plot. Not that there's anything to give away, really, and it's secondary to the bar scenes and the music. But if you don't go into this movie expecting acting and an actual story, and just accept it for the on-screen party that it is, it can be a pretty enjoyable time and a great movie for getting down and dirty with your date."
3,"Brainless, but not without brawn","If you're looking for a film that's smart AND sexy, this isn't it. However, if you just want to relax and fill your mind with a couple of hours of loud music, a gooey romance, and a ""dreams finally fulfilled"" kind of story, this is the right movie. The women dance hard, the boy is cute (and one of the founders of the group Tap Dogs), and the songs Violet writes are a little too sappy to be pop. Playing the 'new girl' Piper Perabo turns in a believable performance as the wide-eyed hopeful in the big bad city. However, it was always a little too convenient that everytime she or those around her get in hot water, she always saves the day. The supporting cast of women are indeed bad girls punching guys and mouthing off whenever possible. The features on the DVD are actaully pretty inventive. So by all means buy the movie if you're gonna need something thoughtless to get through an all nighter or a slow Friday night. In short, it's just brainless fun."
2,"The bar scenes were cool, but that's about it","I bought this movie because I love Jerry Bruckheimer movies. I should have just rented it. The only entertaining part of this movie was the bar scenes, all of which were shown in the trailer. That about sums up the good scenes. When I watched the featurette about how hard they were looking for a lead actress and how excited they were to find Piper Perabo, I couldn't believe it! Perabo's acting was so annoying, she ruined the whole movie for me. Her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded. I just wanted to smack her and say just do it and stop your whining and sniveling! I'm one of those people who like all kinds of movies, even some really bad ones, but this is one that I don't think I will be watching again."
1,Coyote Stupid,"This movie is so dumb... ""HOW DUMB IS IT?"" This movie is so dumb that even though it has a bunch of hot chicks dancing around in sexy clothes provocatively it is anything but sexy and provocative. Dumb, Dumb, DUMB.Did I mention that it stunk too."
1,These chicks think they're so cool and tough,"Yeah, let one of 'em spend a day with Ted Bundy... let's see how damn tough they act after such an experience. Stupid women."
1,men are pigs,"This is one of those movies that really disgusts me in the way it depicts women stutting their stuff and men drooling over them... I absolutely hate these type of flicks. Hey, with a little imagination you can pretend that you are at a strip bar and that they are taking 'em off just for you. I found myself looking for women in the bar. NONE. this is just Pig S#*T. You are a jerk if you think this is cool. Needless to say I did not care for it, and I very much appreciate hot women, don't get me wrong. This just sucked."
2,Not worth buying...a renter at best,"A plot and story that has been done before, better. Miserably bad acting: Tara Banks, Leanne Rymes. Only highlight: John Goodman. Better yet, rent something else."
3,"Fun, boring, entertaining, stupid, and Good!!!!","I know my title is some what confusing but allow me to explain. When I went to see this movie had to be the best time ive had in a movie theatre since.....Ever! Everyone was actually dancing and singing and laughing and Ive never seen a movie that made a whole theatre of people do that, it was the best! I thought the opening credits were pretty boring, and certain scenes in the movie too, but I guess you kinda need the love story parts to tie it all together though. I really didnt like Perabo's character very much, she kinda bothered me, I dunno she actually seemed kinda stupid, i cant really explain it. Over all I thought the movie was pretty entertaining and very good...seeing wet girls jump around on a bar wasent so bad either!"
1,Dumb movie,This was the biggest waste of time I have ever seen. The only person that would be interested in this movie is a thirteen-year old boy. Tyra Banks should stick to her day job. She is much better as a model for Victoria's Secret because she never has to open her mouth & speak. I want the wasted hour & a half of my life back. This movie was very predictable & lame. Don't waste your time.
5,Great Movie,Coyote Ugly may not be the ideal family movie but it is excellent. it tells the story of young female musician whose only dream is to have someone like Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey sing her songs. After moving to New York on her own she is forced to find work in order to remain living in her apartment. She meets up with the Coyotes and finally finds her dreams through them. Excellent movie with a great cast.
4,More true than most people realize,"As an aspiring singer, I found this film to be closely related to the struggles that musicians go through. Unlike Violet, I don't have stage fright, as a matter of fact, I love being on stage. However, taking 'odd' jobs is something that I'm very relatible to. Even tho I've never taken a job at a bar quite like Coyote Ugly, it shows that when you are trying to achieve a dream, you do whatever possible. So far when it comes to dancing on a bar, I've only ever done it for fun, but it just goes to prove that we don't have an easy time of it trying to make it in the music business, and this type of scenerio is incredibly possible because when you're desperate, you do whatever it takes, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of dignity...even tho you can still have a hell of a lot of fun doing it. Over all this film is easily a 4 because it's not just about girls shaking it on a bar, it's about getting what you want."
4,"A cute, entertaining movie.","I'm pretty sure for all of us guys whose seen the trailer for the first time thought this movie was targeted for the male audience. But guess what, producer Jerry Bruckheimer fooled us! It's a... chick flick! But it's a... good chick flick! Not only is Piper Perabo's character is infectiously loveable, but the other Coyotes are hot and sexy as well. The plot isn't extra-ordinary, but it's fun to watch with the help of the great soundtrack and funny moments. The DVD features a behind-the-scenes look at the movie, cool graphics, and a music video with LeAnn Rimes."
2,too much gyrating and not enought interest for me,"Now, this is my mind on this movie. Too much focusing on women dancing on bars and not on story and characters, hence this is a boring movie, but the women are good, but this movie is boring. Now see you wouldnt get me on a table and dance and take it off, nope, not my thing. John Goodman as Piper Perabo's father is a treat though. This is Tyra Bank's first big movie breakout and see does it nice. As far as i'm concerned the thought of Coyote Ugly 2 would be more of the same, except that Piper Perabo, not Maria Bello trains the new recruit and it would be more of the same but new moves, but more of the same. Also starring Adam Garcia."
2,Iz love Tira but this is still abd,really boring dull cjhick flick that is awful. i lov u tira but this isn;'t a ggod movie. i didnt wantt o watch thers people at all. but i do want to go into this club.
2,Cringeworthy.,"Viewed: 2/06Rate: 32/06: Coyote Ugly displayed a fair story that made my skin to crawl. A dopey looking girl who happens to dance sexily like never before and got everything going in a big city New York? That'll never happen. This film explains the reason why I have nightmares from taking, eventually dropped out of, Women's Studies in college. I don't need to be manhandled like that by a film like Coyote Ugly, telling me that women like those depicted in the film are the bomb and everything. I rather watch true films, touching realistic issues that surround females such as Hoop Dreams, My Left Foot, and The Miracle Worker, not crappy movies like Coyote Ugly. What's up with the title? Really, what's up with the concept? No, really...what's up with the actual realization of this movie being made? Maybe I should open a bar, have women wooing the male patrons, and face the music of being deported to prison for numerous of pimping violations."
2,"sticky sweet, predictable...","I am so glad I waited to see this movie on cable. 30 minutes into it, I almost changed the channels. But, just like an accident or police car chase, you have to watch. Overall, the movie was just too sappy. And every ""twist"" is not surprising. Also, I don't understand why the movie switched between color and black-and-white -- I'm guessing the decision was made in a very late editing session because it didn't seem to have any context. In conclusion, I thought the bar scenes were the best...I can't believe I'm agreeing with the guys. I encourage you to check your cable listings if you're curious about this movie and spend your money on something better."
1,A nightmare!,I rented this poor excuse for a movie and couldn't help falling asleep the whole time. It's pretty predictable and not very entertaining. It's not really worth buying.
4,Blondie meets Rimes in a bar with attitude,"This is not a great movie in the aspects of technique or storytelling. It is movie that does one thing great, entertain. The sole purpose of a movie is to entertain the viewer. ""Footloose"" and ""Dirty Dancing"" were not great movies but they will never be forgotten because they entertained the viewer. ""Coyote Ugly"" is a feel-good about yourself movie. The music energizes the audience. The bar dancing keeps the movie-watchers interested. I went the movie with two friends who were both girls. I am 18 and they are 17. We all really liked the movie. The rest of the night we were dancing around and singing the music that we heard. This is great movie because it leaves a lasting impression on the viewer."
4,Really Good Movie!,I saw this movie because I`m a Leann Rimes fan and she`s in it.I was pretty impresed with this movie and I highly reccomend it to anyone almost!Definately a must-see!
5,Nice show (Recommended),"The strengths of this DVD are : 1) A nice storyline which shows how a country girl tries to survive in NY. 2) Nice music eg. Can't fight the moonlight, etc. throughout the show. 3) Girl-Appeal esp. the innocence of Piper Perabo and the sensuality of the coyotes. 4) Romance with a nice ending :) 5) various commentaries on the movie 6) music video of 'can't fight the moonlight'"
5,GREAT!,"I thought that this was going to be a really stupid movie of only bar dancing scenes, but I was wrong there were bar dancing scenes but they also tried to put a story."
1,Special effects?!,"Coyote Ugly has the worst cgi and special effects I have never seen before in all my years of movie bashing. Actually, I just started watching movies last week. Due to Coyote Ugly, I'll never watch another bad movie again."
2,This is a 2 star movie if you're not a girl and under 16,"This movie is a pretty boring tale of the surburban girl going to New York and getting her dreams crushed before finally making it to the big time. Being a 26 year old male, the only thing about this movie that was enjoyable were the nice looking girls. The guy in this movie does one of the worst acting jobs Ive ever seen, and nothing ever really happens. If you have a good taste for movies, then you shouldnt like this movie. Again, if I were a 14 year old girl, I would probably like this movie because it was geared towards 12-17 year old girls. To give the movie some credit, it was kind of a ""cute"" story, but thats about it. (Also, no bar like that is going to have only 1 bouncer, gimme a break!)"
3,it had good and bad things about it,"I personaly thoght that this was a movie that was made to make guys droole and sneak in a pretty bad story line so that a small portion of girls would hopfully enjoy it. I hear people saying "" oh it is going to be a classic love story"" i mean come on it obviously is a movie with a weak and predictable storyline to hopfully cover up that it's main attraction is hot chicks dancing in tight cloths. But then there is a twist n my opinion for I am a guy therefor it gained a star or two with the hot ladies. I think any smart, teen movie goer(like myself)would agree"
1,Good intentions... Horrible execution.,"Piper Perabo is a great new face in Hollywood and I look forward to seeing what she does next. That said, I believe the director and editor (more on that later) should be taken to a public place and caned with a bamboo pole.What starts as a cute girl-coming-of-age-in-the-big-city movie begins to fall apart the moment the girl who's too shy to sing in front of anyone starts working in a bar that requires her to dance on the bar while getting buckets of water dumped on her. ""Oh I'm too shy to sing one of my songs in front of my new date, but I'll strip for him!"" What???There is a spasmatic sequence with a phone call, a trip to a club, a family reunion and a performance that had to have been spliced together by an MTV editor that drank way too much Mountain Dew while eating pixie sticks. One character even repays a debt that was cut out so she couldn't have even known that she owed it!Hopefully Piper will have better luck with ""Slap Her, She's French"" this year."
1,Another tax-loss movie?,"You know you're watching a bad movie when your partner leans over to you and, without ever having seen the movie before, outlines the plot in detail, including accurate descriptions of most of the scenes to follow minutes after the opening credits have run.What on earth was Bruckheimer thinkning when he made this? I can only assume he had a contract with the studio to produce a certain number of movies and this was one of his 'fillers'.An unlikely plot to say the least, the acting was substandard and John Goodman, usually a decent actor, looked embarassed to be associated with this, seemingly hanging about in scenes waiting for his check to clear before he could leave.I've no doubt this movie earns at least 4 stars from many people who use this site; the teenage girl and mid 20's male I'm sure think this is an 'awesome' movie. Utter dross; Hollywood really needs a fresh injection of writing talent."
5,Great Movie,I thought that this movie was very good and the girls very hotter than John Goodman in the Mojave Desert. Bruckheimer did a great job and the story line is really good
5,"It's Entertainment, Folks","I am so tired of reading reviews from people who think every movie should be an artistic masterpiece, or at the very least, should have a poignant message. This is one of the most entertaining films my wife and I have seen in a long time, and none of the people involved with its production have anything to apologize for. It unquestionably delivers exactly what Bruckheimer, et al intended, and it does not pretend to be anything else. If I wanted something artistic or meaningful, I would have looked for word ""Miramax"" on the outside of the box - a studio that has made many wonderful movies, but not the type of high impact, SIMPLE fun Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have delivered so well. Sometimes, it's just what the doctor ordered.Turn out the lights, turn up the volume, break out the popcorn, have a few drinks, and enjoy..."
1,Howlingly Horrible,"This was one of the most embarassingly bad films I've seen in recent memory.I watched this because there is a 14 year old in the house who is understandably amused by girls in their early twenties dancing on top of a bar....and is willing to watch a non-plot for a half-hour between those scenes. Short of a pubescent male, I have to think that anyone who enjoyed this movie is either miguided (hopefully) or an idiot.If this is really what a person looks for in a film, let me recommend saving your money and watching nearly any television sit-com....they're just as bad and it won't cost you four bucks a pop. Take that extra four bucks and donate it to the library. That way, people who are dragging the human race intellectually down to such a depth can at least offset the damage they do by hopefully lifting someone else up."
2,"Bruckheimer Should Stick With ""Guy"" Movies...","I'm usually not disappointed with a Bruckheimer film, so this was definately a first. The plot was cheesy and slow: All-American, apple-pie, girl next door goes to ""The Big City"" to make it big in the music business...Meets good-looking orphan who helps her overcome stage fright in the most romantic of ways. The movie would have been better if it was, indeed, about the women of Coyote Ugly. The bar owner's story would have resulted in a better movie and a less misleading title. This movie will most likely be a hit with teeny bopper Backstreet Boys fans and junior high school age boys."
3,Not A Typical Bruckheimer Film,"There are no loud explosions or endless amounts of ammunition fire in the film. This is unlike the majority of Bruckheimer's pictures. However, instead of guns and violence we get drunk women dancing on top of a bar to some cool music. The movie centers around the main character Violet, played by rising star Piper Perabo(Rocky and Bullwinkle). She just movie to the ""Big Apple"" from a local small town and is desperate for work. She is a struggling song writer dealing with issues about singing her work. She needs money and is getting desperate. Enter the bar Coyote Ugly. From there on we watch a Cocktailish movie with stars like Tyra Banks, Maria Bello, and Melanie Lynskey call the shots. Most would say that this is a chick flick and not worth a watch. But watching these women give the orders, you can't help but enjoy yourself."
1,really weak Film,nothing really happening with this Film.the Girls were Looking Good but as far as the Film Goes not much Happening.it's one of those films you watch when you are in Pure T&A type of Mood.it's fairly a Air-Head Film.
5,Great movie to watch,I can watch this over and over again. I had to wait for it to come on tv until I finally bought it
4,Great Movie,"I love this movie,i watched it the first time with my best friend and then realized that i had to have a copy of it because its such a great movie"
4,"Like the first, but withoutt he dark edge.","This album still has the great vocals, and the rock and techno combination. So whats the big difference between this and their self- titled album? The songs on this one don't have the same dark edge and I don't think that Shirley's vocals work as well. That being said its still a good album and worth a buy (after you've purchased their first). Best songs:Temptation Waits- Seductive.I think I'm Paranoid- Has a pretty dark vibe to it.When I grow up- Being a teenager I really relate to the lyrics.Medication- It does for this album what ""Queer"" did for their first.Special- Catchy.Push it- Interesting lyrics."
5,I can't get enough of this 'garbage',"Another collection of the hypnotic Shirley Manson tunes. This album is equally entrancing and rocking. I didn't think they could top there 1st cd but they clearly are exceptional musicians. If your a Shirley Manson fan (lover), you've got to get Version 2.0. She will take you away....(again)."
4,Not as good as the first,With version 2.0 Grabage tries to relive the newness of the first album by upping the techno and yet they fall into a very pop like atmosphere in a series of their songs. But as always the are at the head of the pack.
5,Sometimes an album just clicks,"It sounds right, is the best way to say this. Sometimes an album just clicks, tracks in order, everything moving smoothly together. Such is the sound of VERSION 2.0, a big, liquid album with a song for every mood. Here is a group that enjoys playing together -- see them in concert; they have a good time -- and they spend the album playing with us, doing bleak, doing frantic, doing downright catty. Showing off? They have a right to. This is very good stuff."
4,"a good two thirds of the cd were good songs, the rest wernt","i think the songs paranoid, special, push it, and wicked ways were overall the good best songs that have ever been put out by garbage. the rest weren't anything special, but they were good none the less."
5,"Excellent, excellent!","When I read professional music critics' reviews about Version 2.0, I read these super technical descriptions and criticisms of the album which honestly, is a waste of time. Why don't they say the truth without further hassle? This album is excellent from the first track to the last. For even those who aren't familiar with Garbage or their first album but just want to rock, this is a great choice. It's excellent--EXCELLENT!"
5,Can't get better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Push It- makes the listener wonder what the heck she's talking about.Special-Interesting song about liking but now hating.Hammering in my Head-A fast techno song.There's not one bad song on this album and I would tell about other songs but... Anyways you cant go wrong!
5,One of the best albums of 1998,"Garbage returned in '98 with their excellent sophmore album. VERSION 2.0 is so slick, you'll slip on it. Shirley Manson [lead vocals and songwriter] vamps every song for all it's worth. She's slick, sly, and clever in every delivery. VERSION 2.0 is groove heavy with more electroica than their debut back in '95. Garbage became more of a pop band with this album. The hooks and melodies are awesome. Each track is seemless, timeless, pop mixed with rock and electronic influences. VERSION 2.0 is an improvement from their debut. Shirley's voicals are exellent. It's sexy and it goes very well with this awesome album."
4,This is good music!!!!!!,"Shirley Manson has an incredibly sexy voice, and when she's backed up by awesome techno beats and grinding guitars, Garbage can really make some great music. My favorite tracks are When I Grow Up and Hammering in my Head. After a while, though, the songs can get repetitive, especially towards the end of the cd, but no real harm done. If you want cool guitars with a good beat, you should check out Garbage's Version 2.0!!"
5,"version 2.0-newer, faster, better","after the fanstatic acclaimed debut album, garbage had a rough second album to make.well, version 2.0 is the perfect second album. More pop-electronic and yet with the same dark obscure feeling the first album had.shirley's voice is more adaptaded to the songs and they seem to be more a band than they used to. one of garbage's best caracteristics is that all musics are very good. here you can't say that one or two songs are below the average, because they're all excellent. please listen to this album, that confirms that garbage are one of the best (or why not, the best!) band around!"
5,garbage ROCK!,This is my first garbage CD and I really enjoy it. The words are very powerfull and Shirley Manson's voice is amazing! I highly recommend this CD.
3,Hooks Galore and it Rocks too!,"What can you say about an album that melds pop hooks with the rubbery blast of guitar riffs so indelibly that you wonder why no one has thought of this sooner? (And no, Bon Jovi, doesn't count). Unlike other bands that may be accused of sellout status, Garbage nimbly avoids this niche by constructing pop songs without compromising their edginess. Credit Shirley Manson for singing without the saccharine grandstanding of today's divas and kudos to Butch Vig for producing a sharp sound replete with hooks that beg to repeat in your brain over and over."
2,"Nothing new here, just a Curve [copy] band.",Save your money and just buy any Curve album. Garbage won't sound too original anymore.
1,Weak...,"Garbage is an alright band. I'd heard them live BEFORE they became huge. Still, this album fails to match their true potential... this is really weak."
5,Perfect! Well written!,"I saw Garbage in concert at The Night 89x Stole X-Mas in Detroit, and they were by far the best group there. This album is excellent. A definate buy!"
5,warning: this CD is extremely addictive,"All I had ever heard of Garbage were a couple of their music videos until my friends persuaded me to buy this CD. Now I listen to it at least twice a week. I usually go for music with lighter lyrics, but I've fallen head-over-heels in love with all these songs, even ""Medication"". As much as I love the whole CD, I do have favorites: I listen to ""When I Grow Up"" and ""Hammering in My Head"" so much I'm bound to wear the CD out!"
5,Better than words can describe,"Garbage has no doubt put out a kickass sophomore album!! I'm completely hooked on the song ""You Look So Fine""-it takes me to a different world. Special also is one of the greatest singles out there right now! I got it for Christmas and haven't hardly gotten through a day without listening to it. Once you hear Shirley's voice, there's no turning back, and if you do than there is something wrong with you! I enjoyed this album just as much as their first, but i appreciate this one on a whole different level. There's no trash involved with this garbage. Aside from Pink Floyd, there is no better!!! YOU HAVE GOT TO BUY IT!!!"
4,Garbage blends rock and pop into a winning combination,"Shirley Manson's melodious voice flows through each track of Version 2.0 flawlessy and beautiful, backed up by Butch Vig's stellar percussion, and Duke Erikson and Steve Marker's guitar. Taking in each song of Garbage is a joy. Some might be over-syntesized but if you break that barrier you can see and feel the genius that is Garbage. You journey from the Euro-dance style of ""Hammering in my head"" to the genuine rock-pop sound of ""I think I'm paranoid"". Garbage Version 2.0 aims to please."
2,I expected more,I expected a lot more from Garbage. I bought this cd in hopes that it would be really great but only found satisfaction with four songs out of the rest of the 12 tracks. Three of these four songs are out on the radio anyway. My rating? I'll give version 2.0 a C+ for a good attempt
5,One of the few cd's that you can just let play through,"Garbage has released one of the few cd's that can just play through, with every song having a certain flavor and enjoyability. Songs on this album range from dark and stormy (push it) to fast paced rock (when i grow up) and each has a pleasent variety. The songs lyrics are deep and meaningfull, and are easy to relate to, in my opion, version 2.0 is a groundbreaking and interesting album, that is sure to delight many a wide audiance."
4,Garbage Gone Techno?,"Version 2.0 is a refreshing change for Garbage. Much more techno and less guitar, the general feel of the album is lighter than the previous debut album. Shirley Manson's vocals are great, she sounds happy, and she does a lot of her sexy whispering. The songs are catchy and mostly upbeat including the new hit 'Push It'. A few tracks are instrumentally overpowering- the vocals are hard to hear. Some of the lyrics don't make a lot of sense...but overall Version 2.0 is an impressive effort. After you listen to it you'll find yourself humming Garbage tunes trying to sound like Shirley. :)"
4,Garbage - hardly!,"This is a great album. I bought it because of the singles: I think I'm Paranoid, When I Grow Up, Push It, Special, You Look So Fine - they are all fantastic, but there are other great songs as well. The songs have instant hooklines that make them catchy - but not poppy. Shirley's voice is amazing, and very seductive in a raw kind of way. The songs are atmospheric, good to chill out to, and also good to rock to. Standout tracks are: Push It, I think I'm Paranoid, Temptation Awaits, Special, When I Grow Up, Medication. Temptation Awaits is a fantastic opening track, and the others follow in the same footsteps. This album is different to their debut, although still very recognisable as Garbage. I love this album, I'd recommend it to anyone who liked their first album, also fans of Gran Turismo by The Cardigans would like this, and also fans of Celebrity Skin by Hole. If you like indie/rock that isn't the same dreary stuff that a lot of bands produce - then GET this!"
5,Great CD!,"I loved the first CD, but was doubtful about the 2cnd, since I'm used to the first CD being the better one. (Alanis Morissette) I got a pleasant surpise, since this one is just as sweet as the first one!!!"
5,A great album,"There is no competition...this is my undisputed, absolute favorite CD (since the last release from Garbage). Version 2.0 is addicting, from the lively (and occasionally erratic)techno beats to Shirley Manson's breathy, seductive verbal catharsis (laser recodred for our enjoyment!), it leaves you yearning for more. This CD takes a person on a sort of emotional roller coaster. From ""Temptation Waits"", a celebration of dependance and obsession to ""You look so fine"" a melancholy longing for ""ever after"" (i.e. riding of into sun sets and such...) It's a trip and I fully endorse it (regardless of my insignificance). BUY IT ALREADY!"
3,Garbage's latest lacks oomph.,"Perhaps I was too knocked out of my chair by their 1st effort, but V 2.0 has a lackluster feel to it. There isn't the urgency and catchy melodies that captured me before. It has a certain bland, modern sound that I find boring. Like everything was airbrushed. Tom"
5,Love this CD!,I have loved Garbage for a long time now... and I have her first two CD's and I am so excited that she's come out with another one. Shirley is AWESOME! I love her voice.. and I don't believe that anyone else has a voice like hers. Garbage ROCKS!!
5,You gotta love garbage,"After missing theirr recent Toronto concert at the phoenix (sold out in 20 minutes!), and reading reviews, I had to buy this CD. So I did... I liked the first album but I LOVE version 2.0. Everything from the clever Album title to the amazing mix of wonderful songs made me fall in love with garbage for real!!!If you're at all unsure about garbage, just buy this CD and see what happens.... But don't forget to get your concert tickets as soon as they go on sale!"
3,"Sonically unmatched, and certainly self-destructive","There's no sure thing in music, but the closest thing is that Garbage will make great sounds if they merely take a little time between Packer football games to pick up their guitars and sticks. Even so, it appears that this group of music quarterbacks haven't yet found a way to sing to the human heart, and, as this is their second album, they probably never will. Though they're easily one of the most sonically-talented group of rock artists out there, they've still got no soul. And soul is what stays with you long after the latest rock trend has died."
5,Good,"I had never heard Garbage before I listened to Version 2.0 at a listening kiosk at Tower Records, but I was immediately hooked. It's like a modernized Pretenders on steroids. I'd definitely recommend it. END"
5,"So far, the best cd this year","Garbage's higly anticipated second cd three years after their first is a must have for all Garbage fans. It has a faster and more up-beat tempo. Garbage has been nominated 8 times for the video to their great song, ""Push It."" I'm sure that they'll when all 8. I highly recommend this cd."
5,woo!,"This album is a classic. I've had this CD for probably over a year now, and I *still* listen to it often.One of the things that makes this album so amazing is that there are no ""duds"". Every track seems to work and fit together. The amount of feeling Shirley Manson throws into the songs is amazing, and the melodies seem to only add on to that.Buy it. This is one of those albums that sucks you in from the first track, and doesn't let go. In fact, when you're finished listening to it, you'll want to play the whole thing over. :)"
5,Huge Garbage fan anyway...,"..but this is my go-to album when I want a perk-me-up and to listen to the best. So many great songs on this one. Love ""When I Grow Up"", ""Push It"", The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"" and ""You Look So Fine"". Music now just doesn't compare. Which is why I'm excited about the whispers of a new album this coming year. Can't wait."
5,Undoubtedly THE BEST Garbage Album thus far!,"This is a great album by Garbage! I love the modern and hip beat of ""Special."""
5,New Type of Funk,"new and exciting sound, very nifty beat. I really like this one folks, it has a new type of funk that sets it aside from all imatators. If you buy just one cd this year let it be this one, it all starts here."
4,"A very ""Special"" album.","I was one of those people who dismissed Garbage when they first came out because I was a big fan of Curve. I know, I was a stupid boy. ""Version 2.0"" is when I realized this is an amazing band. I'd be shocked if any fan of techno, pop, alternative, or girl-fronted-rock-bands didn't love this disc. In itself it's almost the best of Garbage. They all sound like singles. Other than the obvious 3-4 hits, I was most impressed by ""Temptation Waits"", ""Medication"", ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"", and ""You Look So Fine"". If you've ever thought about getting some Garbage, especially this album, do it. Don't be a stupid boy/girl."
5,"I have both Garbage CD's, and this is the best one","I must admit that i don't care as much for the first Garbage CD as I do Version 2.0. This is by far my favorite CD. I like it so much that I listen to it all the time. I know the whole CD by heart(almost). My favorite songs on this album are Temptation Waits, I Think I'm Paranoid, Push It, and Wicked Ways. It realllllyyyyy RRRRROOOOOOCKSSSSS!!!!!!!"
4,Don't forget to take out this Garbage!,"I was unsure as to how Garbage planned to mutate their music to produce a whole new CD. I loved the first album, but feared the upcoming release would simply be more of the same. Fortunately, it was! I am not sure how to explain how Butch Vig and Co. manage to keep me interested from song to song other than pure magic."
4,shirley manson you get two thumbs up!,THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST RELEASE OF 1998! THEY'RE IS ARTISTIC GENIOUS HERE AND THE QUALITY OF THE SONGS ARE OUTSTANDING! SHIRLEY MANSON IS ONE TERRIFIC SONGWRITER
5,Amazing CD,"I had just heard a little bit of the song ""Push It"" and I had to run out and buy the CD, the CD has so much into it that now anything that Garbage has out, I have to find and listen to it. I especially like the song, ""The trick is to keep breathing"" Shirley Manson's voice is amazing, I can't think of any other way to put it. I recomment this CD totally."
5,Garbage - The world's coolest pop group,"I just started listening to garbage about a month ago. Their latest album Version 2.0 is fantastic! The guitar work along with Shirley Manson's distinctive style of singing ( evident in Temptation waits , I think I'm paranoid , When I grow up, Push it ,You look so fine) is just too good. They are a class apart from all the stale pop groups around us . Garbage, to me is God!"
5,great,"i lvoe garbage, every song on their albums are so good you can just play the whole cd straight. and shirley manson is so hot and butch vig si so cool"
5,"""Version 2.0"" is the greatest!","Shirley Manson and Co. has done it again! The techno music combined with the raw but truthful lyrics makes this CD one of the best I've listened to. With the combination of slow and fast, moody and light, Version 2.0 shows Shirley Manson's talent as never seen before. The pulsing music stays in your head for hours and you can totally relate to some of the lyrics. This is without a doubt one of my favorite CD's!"
5,First One's Better,"Not taking away from this album which is absolutley awesome but i missed the angry edge to shirley's voice, this album was pop where the first one was rock but still absolutley rocks, shoulda won da grammy"
5,most awesome CD ever recorded!!!!,wow my friend got me started on garbage a few months ago and that was the start of another big garbage fan!!!this band kicks arse!!!!!!thank you Annie!!!!
3,Curve b-sides... a good description,"First the gripes... these guys and a girl stole their career from Curve, and anyone who thinks this is original or that Shirley is a groundbreaking female singer or lyricist of any kind needs to check out any Curve release, namely Doppleganger or Cuckoo, like right now.That said, this is an improvement over the s/t... whereas I cant enjoy anything except ""Milk"" and parts of ""Vow"" on the first album, at least half this album is quality. ""Special"" is a nice pop song... ""Push It"" mixes techno and shoegaze fairly well, and ""The Trick is to Keep Breathing"" is a good Portishead song that might be the best thing these folks have done.If you have to get on the Garbage wagon, this is their one album worth owning, just make sure you get a couple Curve albums first."
5,Great Graphics Card!,"After buying a new Pentium 4 system, I was tight for cash. Luckily enough I managed to come upon the Radeon 7000. It has one of the best image qualities I've seen and its performance isn't too bad either."
1,Not PCI Port,"I did not realize that I needed a PCI Port card and the web site did not indicate this requirement nor that this card was AGI. My son pointed it out to me after I ordered the card. When I contacted Tiger Direct, they did not know that it needed an AGI slot. They told me to call the Distributor - Diamond, who after a 35 minute wait on hold, said it was not his product (it was). When the card arrived and I confirmed that it was not PCI, I was able to return it and get a full refund. It was a hassle taking the box to be returned. I would have preferred to know about this before I ordered it."
3,"Old music, fun listening.","In perspective these are some of the most popular songs of their time. I enjoy the historical value of songs from the past. Hearing someone sing about things you may have only learned from a history book, makes it more real."
3,Ball smell,"It is what it is, but man this think stinks - a very strange mix of rubber and orange smell, that is not abating after a week of sitting next to an open window."
5,A good season,"I've watched One Tree Hill since the first episode the first season. I have to say that I'm not as passionate about the show as I used to be; the characters Lucas and Peyton left and I thought that would ruin the show. However, that just lead to the show growing and getting to know smaller characters more. Season seven of One Tree Hill is amazing and the actors/actresses are great. It's a good show and the dvd allows for episodes to be watched without commercials. It's also the smallest and most compact dvd case out of all of the seasons (I have all 7). I would recommend this item."
4,Love Sophia,"I've watched every episode of season 7, I really loved it! I'm a big sophia bush fan, so I love her work. I love the Brooke/Julian relationship, I think they are worth watching. Haley and Nathan are still going strong. I also like the new characters. Of course you feel the emptiness of Lucas and Peyton but the cast really makes up for their absence!! Maybe they will return for a episode or two. I would like to see Brooke's almost adopted daughter make a return also!"
2,Terrible season. Terrible stories.,"First of all, Peyton was my favorite character. Second of all, Haley, Mouth and Millie are unlikable characters, in my opinions. Does anyone care about Skills and his girlfriend Lauren, or Mouth and his job? And YET again, Nathan and Haley's marriage is on shaky ground. Everything seems recycled. Fortunately, Clay is the beacon of the light. A likable guy who seemed unable to commit, he found his love in Quinn. Yet again Schwahn decides to kill someone off, this being Haley and Quinn's mother. Yet again, Schwahn uses the plot line of a crazy stalker. Unfortunately, the character of Dan is not in much of the season. Attempts to be funny were made, such as the girls getting high of pot brownies. Attempts failed. Terrible season. The only reason I will watch season 8 is because of Clay, and because I've been watching since the beginning. The show should have ended after season 6."
2,cheaper at target,I purchased this set in early december paid over 40.00 -- the next week target had it on sale for 23.00 returned it ... also bought another dvd set(house) and also found that for over 20.00 cheaper at bjs ... the week before christmas amazon put this on sale .... check your prices look around... I overpaid by a total of 40.00 then was charged 3.00 each by amazon for returning it and it took over a week for my credit to come though....
5,Better than expected,"When I found out that Lucas and Peyton were off the show, I was very disappointed.I did not think they would be able to coninue the show well without those 2 characters. But, with the new characters, the show is still as amazing as its always been. Very entertaining season, I could not stop watching it!"
2,One Tree Hill Season 7,This was a good product overall. it was just bad quality. it seemed like it was burned off of an original. Every disk says disk 1 the title scene is blurry and parts of the episodes are pretty choppy.
2,So Corny.,"First, I want to say I watched the entire season and have seen the entire series. This season was pitiful There were points that you laugh out loud from it being so stupid and corny. Nobody acts like they do and Jamie's character which was good in the 5th and 6th seasons has become stupid. The show isn't the same without Lucas and Peyton, it's just dumb. The writing is just terrible, worst show of the year. I've never seen anything so corny. The new characters are ok, but this show shouldn't be surviving without Lucas and Peyton because it is so pointless and stupid without them. Even without them, it's too bad the writers and producers couldn't make it interesting and dramatic. Instead it's full of games, messes, snowball fights, and stupidity. Don't waste your time or money. Try some of the shows like 90210, Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, and others which would be way more worth your time and money."
5,Very pleased,No problems with order! Received item within time frame. Haven't played the DVDs yet but they are new in packaging so any problems with DVD would not be seller fault.
4,Ahem. Please allow me to change my mind.,"Rather than skipping this CD and buying only ""Strauss Dances,"" as I recommended in June, buy both and copy them onto two sides of a 90-minute audio cassette.Rolfe Kent's soundtrack holds up very well over time -- except for the last number, a vocal not heard in the movie. Rearrange and re-engineer the songs as you like them. I put ""Tivoli-Rutsch Walzer"" on the tape where it should have been.You might also find Django Rhinehart's ""Honeysuckle Rose,"" which worked so well in the movie, and insert that where it should be. Lose the ""Back Where You Belong"" vocal and let Sting sing last.On the other side, let the Gaudier Ensemble serenade you with ""Tivoli"" and whatever other dances you like. Voila, the perfect tape."
3,Two Good Songs,"The soundtrack for ""Kate & Leopold"" includes the wonderful ""Still"" by Sting, but the rest of the soundtrack is instrumental. While stirring and reminiscent of the movie, calling up the images and dialog in one's memory, it's not something to listen to over and over. If you can find it, and don't want the incidental soundtrack, just buy the one song."
3,"Buy it for one song, ""Until""","Joanne Long's reviews are right on target. I bought the soundtrack for Sting's masterpiece ""Until"". While the score can be lovely at times, I find myself tuning out. The 'flavor' of the movie, the Strauss Dances, is missing. Buy the soundtrack for Sting's deeply moving waltz. I cannot find that song recorded anywhere else. Then follow Ms. Long's instructions for the perfect recording!"
4,christmas gift for kids,"I bought this game for my kids. They all like it and are able to play it easily. Their ages are 3,5,8 and 10 and they all are able to play it and enjoy it. I recomend this game for young kids and beginning gamers."
1,Amazon duped. Me too.,"This game can NOT be played on the Xbox system that is sold in the stores today!! Maybe I should have known that, but I didn't. I feel as thought sellers should have pointed this out in their ad.My son has an older Xbox, and I am currently waiting for him to get that out of storage to see if the game will play there. Until then, my rating of the transaction is that it was the worst for me ever on Amazon.com, but that may change to an OK."
2,Pac Man World 2,I have got it with a crack in the disk when I got it and also I do not now how it play I cannot play it with the crack in the disk and yes I let them now about it nothing was done about it
5,great flag-waving action movie,"This movie is by far one of my favorites but you can't take it seriously. In the movie, Chuck's protege ""Deke Slater"" nabs the terrorist leader Fidal Rasheed by sky-diving out of a stealth fighter over Afganistan and hang-gliding from southern Afganistan to the Indian Ocean in 5 minutes, where a nuclear submarine comes out of nowhere to rescue him. Chuck Norris seems to have forgotten that Afganistan is a landlocked country! The flag-waving (for both America and the great state of Texas) is hilarious. And Chuck Norris tries to take on a Yoda figure role by teaching Deke about using the ""mind's eye"" to sense his opponents and do things ""never thought humanly possible""."
4,Understanding Six Plays,"In Understanding August Wilson Professor Bogumil covers six of his plays: Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Fences, Joe Turner's Come and Gone, The Piano Lesson, Two Trains Running, and Seven Guitars. The book opens with a chapter on August Wilson as an African American playwrite that talks about his life as well as what sets his plays apart from thos of other African American playwrites. Professor Bogumil ties in Wilson's plays to societal facotrs, and has crafted a very fine and scholarly work that makes August Wilson's writing more approachable and understandable to anyone from students to casual readers."
4,Nice Map Book,"This map book has kept me on track several times. I have a garmin GPS as well but sometimes I like to know where I am going before I leave or see if the GPS has picked the way I want to go. The maps also work by them self, once I lent my GPS to a friend and I had to navagate on my own using the the maps to get to a new place, and it worked! I like the binding too, very durable and handy."
4,Ready to throw Fonda away; don't until you see this,"Jane Fonda, with Ms. Redgrave, makes this a reasonable and incredible synopsis of the war and difficulties of free-thinkers at this time. When you see the poor publicity Fonda has gotten recently because she's upset about the latest war, remember too, that you need to see her films and read her autobiography. She is brilliant.She's been there; done that. She deserves great recognition for this wonderful, valid, strong, creative experience of her brave, yet scared character here. She and Redgrave portray the best of intellectuals. And lately, intellectuals seem to be forgotten by the movie business. Here is a saga, a journey, worthy of high praise. Doesn't anyone miss the wonderful historic dramas of times past? This is one, with acting worthy of acclaim."
5,Don't miss this one!,"One of the last great films of that remarkable era of film-making--the 1970's--""Julia"" stands the test of time as a testament to heroism in drastic times of collusion much like our own. We know the bad guys but think we are too weak to stop them--to make a difference--but the story of ""Julia"" gives us strength to at least try. I was about to say the films of today do not have this power, but after experiencing the power of some of this year's extraordinary films like ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Syrianna"" I find hope in the modern arena. Keep the faith."
2,Julia,"I had great hopes for this film, it was after all an Oscar winner, but I now understand why the film was not widely available. I found it disjointed. There seemed to be a lot of time spent shouting down the telephone and smoking cigaretes which would be fine if the conclusion satisfied me, it didn't.The main Character, played by Jane Fonda, seemed naive and hopeless, the title character, played by Vanessa Redgrave was such an enigma that she was unbelievable in substance and played far to minor a role in the film. The only reason that I would like to know what happened next is simply to find out if any strength of resolve would be found! I think probably not."
3,Decent movie,The history aspects were good. The movie was too deep for my taste and I didnt like the ending.
1,I don't understand all the hype over this,Another case of when I side with the minority. I didn't get through it. Decided I had much better ways to spend my time. The only thing I really enjoyed was Meryl Streep's bit. I don't whether she resurfaced later in the film but I guess I'll never know now.
5,Julia DVD,"Excellent movie about two female friends chronicled from childhood through adulthood. I highly recommend this film. As for the seller of this DVD, I received this item very quickly and was very pleased with the condition. I would definitely purchase from this Seller again."
5,One of the BEST films from the 70's,"I must have seen ""Julia "" over 20 times,and I never get tired of it.Fonda and Redgrave are great,along with Jason Robards.Its amazing this is a true story about a period in Lilian Hellman's life,and what a heroic task she did for her friend,Julia.If you have never seen this movie,please make it a point to, about a time in our history we should never forget."
5,Julia,"A wistful, compelling story about the power of female bonds and friendship. Fonda has never been better, Redgrave is luminous as the idealistic Julia, and Jason Robards conveys a worn assuredness as Hellman's husband, writer Dashiell Hammett. Zinnemann's handling of period detail in 1930s New York and Berlin is exquisite, and the film rightfully earned 11 Oscar nominations. A personal favorite."
2,fun at first but will get boring,only the first case is fun and the rest are stupid. dont waste your money on this game like i did
1,Glich Heaven,"I bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell, But I was sadly mistaken when I got halfway through it and I kept hitting glich after glich. I thought it was my Xbox, but I took it to a friend's and glich after glich. I guess I got the worst game in history, but that's what happens when you get a massed produced game like this one"
1,"I like the idea, BUT...","As both a surfer and yoga enthusiast i was excited to see this program created, however, upon watching the video it became clear that it's not all that great. It's hard to follow the poses when you can't see the instructors feet b/c they're buried in the sand and unless you have a decent knowledge of yoga there are a lot of important details about many of the poses that are left out. I'd recommend a non-surfing specified yoga dvd over this. You'll get more out of it."
1,yoga for surfers,don't waste your money .lots of wasted time talking about how great yoga is.content is good but alot of fast fowarding.not useful as a work out video.
1,Dont buy,This video is not good. Peggy seems like a regular soccer mom who decided that she could make a yoga video. Her instructions arent good and her form is not good enough to be teaching others. The editing is pretty bad. And worst of all theres awesome surfing clips on when your head is bent over in your lap. How are you supposed to watch the sweet barrels?Maybe the other two Yoga for Surfers are better but I'm over it.
1,"Don't buy the dvd, and don't buy into the fabricated 5 star reviews","I purchased this as a video, and was not that impressed. It has nice surf footage, but the yoga instruction is really bad. The time would have been better spent slowing going through each yoga pose, versus racing through a large number of poses. Skip this DVD, take a lesson at your local yoga place."
5,Wonderful flow,"What a great video! I just received it and went through the routine. The flow was wonderful. (I am not a surfer, have never surfed, I was just looking for a good video, and everybody recommended this to me.) But maybe now I'll be surfing by summer!"
4,just awesome,"I hate excercise dvds, yoga dvds, and instructional videos. I do Yoga for Surfers every night. Its really the only decent, tolerable video out there. Im getting in shape to get back into surfing and its really helping me. It makes my muscles nice and long, lean, and loose. The relaxation part really is fantastic and helps me stay focused to reach my goal of being a surfer again. My only complaint is that its slightly talk-ey for me. I could do with less talking. Overall though, it has lovely music, Peggy Hall is a great teacher, and its very relaxing. I would say its a great purchase for any level."
2,Yoga For Sufers Review,"As far as yoga instructional DVDs go, this is not one I would recommend. Particularly if you are not familar with yoga already. The poses are not explained as well as in most not-for-surfers DVDs. Often times, you can not see the feet of the instructor, so you do not know how to place your feet unless you already know the pose. I think Peggy is probably a good instuctor, but this DVD isn't a good example. The best part of this DVD is the advert for Rochelle's surf camp, which includes a cameo appearance of Minnie Driver. I found this portion of the DVD to be inspiring. If you are looking for some instruction on yoga poses, this is not a good choice."
3,Good work out if you are familiar with yoga practice.,"I enjoy both the pace and the variety here. The pre surf and after surf sequences are very effective and arranged well. A great way to stay relaxed and focused in and out of the water. After about 3 weeks I began to notice increased flexablity and upper body strength and I've noticed measured improvement that I can 'surf better, longer'. So why just 3 stars? The downside for me is the narrative/interview part kind of chops it up a bit making the pre surf warm up seem a little like an infomercial and taking away from what could/should be instruction for beginners technique-wise. Even when the camera is focused on the instructor it's often only waist up. I enthusiastically recommend this dvd but ONLy if you already have several dozen yoga classes under your belt."
2,"Another Bogus ""How to be a better surfer DVD.""","This is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type. If you have a basic knowledge of yoga, you don't need this at all - you can create and tailor your own workout. If you don't know yoga, it's useless. The instruction is poor, peppered with a split screen of people surfing and practicing yoga (no wonder the surf mags think it's great!) with little, very poorly demonstrated techniques of basic yoga. In some scenes you can't even see their feet (a crucial failure) - even if the ""instructor"" says what to do. Save your money, take yoga long enough to learn it properly, then apply it to your own surfing. Yoga is great for surfing, but this is a poor video."
2,dont do it,"If you know anything about yoga, do not buy this cd. The only positive parts is the location and view of the waves. This is more a novelty than useful. Honestly who does yoga in a wetsuit at pipeline..Try Ali McGraw's Video for a great intermediate yoga tape."
3,Kind of confusing,"The format of the book is a bit confusing, but it's ok. Some of the lessons are incredibly easy, while others are really difficult! I guess that's to be expected."
2,PLEASE READ,"This book does NOT contain a book key. I returned one and the next one didnt have it either. The OLC passcode card is nothing either. The card says that ""code is no longer necessary"". Basically this is a like new book with no extra features. Buy used!"
2,no book key,"I purchased this book under the impression it had a book key for QUIA, required by my profesora.It didn't have any book key... so now i have to return it. And just buy the one from the bookstore, like I should have done from the beginning.Also UPS was a day late, and didn't leave the book as I requested by signing the ""LEAVE PACKAGE"" form left by the delivery man. I had to go pick it up myself because I'm never at home."
3,Not worth it.,"It is definitely whiter than stock headlight bulbs but has lesser light output. It's no 120/110 watts equivalent that they claim. It's overpriced as well, I should have tried the sylvania ultra for a lot less."
2,PIAA are whiter,"There brighter,whiter when I first used these I wasn't to impressed. After driving with them I could notice an improvement over regular lamps."
5,performed as hoped,The plug was exactly what I needed.We used it to blow out the line in winterizing our RV.and it worked.
5,Works very well,This will keep my pipes from freezing and it isn't very expensive. I plan to use it at home and on vacation property. Buy it. It can be adapted to blow out at hose bib connections too. It will save on repairs.
2,Needs some modification,"This thing is ok. But realize, you must hold it onto your blow out port to make it work. Therefore you need 2 people to blow out your pipes. When you are blowing out an rv, constant air pressure is the key. So, saying that, i ripped off the needle and attached an air chuck fitting to it. Now I just screw this on, attach my air hose and pop on the compressor and I no longer need to hold it in place."
4,Clear insights and technique,"This book rocks!! This is the 2d in a Series of books on the topic by Mr Kirby , it picks up where the 1st left off. This is unabashedly a how to book and does it's job clearly and succinctly . Mr Kirby shows the finer points of the art to the student (while not all the techniques are street applicable they demonstrate concepts that are vital to an understanding of the workings of Jujitsu).Mr Kirby also discusses tactics techniques and strategy for use of jj in real situations. The work is excellent and would be complimented by the DVD series Mr Kirby did on the subject. Well Done ."
3,Good follow-up to Kirby's basic book on Jujitsu,"This book contains some valuable techniques and is worth owning (in my opinion). I personally use some of the ideas taught therein. For a Jujitsu book even more replete with techniques, however, I recommend his basic book on JuJitsu. I use several ideas from that guide, too."
3,"Becky Stringer ""olillulu""",I thought that this book reviewed a lot for me and explained to my husband the difference between my Ju-jitsu and his ta kwion do.
2,Impractical,"The previous reviews must have come from students of theauthor's, or students of students of the author's. Perhaps friends ofthe author? I can't imagine anyone thinking this book is good. A good comedy, maybe.The techniques in this Ju-Jitsu book are almost offensive in terms of practicality. And though he does outline some tactics and concepts for applying the techniques of this art, this is most likely a book for his students to read so they can brush up for their tests, but not for serious self-defense.In fact, this is not a book for any one interested in learning self-defense. Buy the book if you want to get killed on the street. Otherwise avoid it, unless you're a student of the author, of course. I'd hate to see what the ""Basic"" book is like, and as funny as this particular book is, it's not worth the money to buy it, even for a good laugh."
3,Exactly like the movie,"If you liked the movie, you'll like the book. They are almost exactly the same. It's written well but not in traditional Elizabeth Chadwick style...more movie script. I highly recommend her other books that are NOT based on a Hollywood movie."
3,It Is A Simple Story,"Most of the reviews were made by persons who had this book read to them (or read it themselves) when they were very young. It was a Grizzly Bear's ""life story,"" simply written, with insight into how animals interact with each other and man in the wild. It is a child's story, though, written from a pre-1950's view of the world. I did not read it as a child, so it didn't hold the same place in my heart as it did with the rest of the reviewers.One thing I didn't get, though, is exactly what it was that Wahb exposed himself to at the very end of the story. Maybe someone can help me out here with a comment."
2,Ray Charles early years,I am very disappointed with this CD set. I hardly recognize the sound on many songs. My favorite is Georgia on My Mind. I never heard a rendition like the one in this set. It is terrible. I am sorry I made this purchase.
2,Quality surprisingly bad,"I am really disappointed with the quality of this 2 CD set. Plus, I wasn't able to find a track list anywhere, and I was missing a LOT of songs I was looking forward to having."
3,common songs-easily available,I like the titles in the album but they are readily available. I'd like to see a large pack like this with songs that are not always found in the KJ albums. I'd like to see a large pack like this with standards from the forties and early fifties.
1,WILL NOT ORDER FROM THIS STORE AGAIN!,This book arrived 2 months after I ordered it. I had already went to my trip to Greece. I was so pissed off!
5,This is a psychological masterpiece.,"I am simply shocked that this novel, which is perhaps the best piece of American fiction I have ever read, is out of stock. It draws a far more realistic and detailed portrait of the ""hard boiled detective"" that so many other writers have simply slapped together, then lets us watch, with first fascination, then horror, as he slowly unravels. Even the minor characters are better drawn then they would be in a trilogy all their own, and the entire work shimmers with energy and power. This is a book that demands republishing."
4,Good Book,Good book although some aspects are very general. See also Surviving Financial Disasters By Tiffany R. Love it comes with a CD ROM.
5,"great book, hopefully wont need it",I bought this book more for a just in case kind of need. I am not filing bankruptcy but if I ever need to then the book contains all the helpful information that someone would need. It has great examples and definitions.
5,A crazy adventure,"Crewel Lye is about the journey of Jordan the Barbarian. Like all Xanth books, this one is comical and full of puns. Since Jordan's talent is full regeneration, it adds an interesting viewpoint through the eyes of a person who doesn't care if he gets killed(he'll just come back). I think that anyone who reads the Xanth series should definitely read this one."
5,Excellent fantsy,My first Piers Anthony book. I can hardly wait for each of the Xanth books to appear.Best fantsy writer.
3,It got me hooked,"The first book I read by Piers Anthony; it got me hooked immediately. Though not his best book (check out the first few books in the ""Xanth"" series or his entire ""Incarnations of Immoratality"" series), it is very well written with an engaging story line. Read it if you're a fan of Anthony or if you're looking to become one"
2,One of those addicting Xanth novels.,"Once you start reading Xanth novels, they become addicting. This one is not as addicting as some of the series"
3,Administrative Analyst thoughts,"I purchased this book to study from for a civil service exam administered by the State of New Jersey. I can honestly say that nothing in this book was on that particular exam, so if you ever taking a test in NJ for an AA type title this book isn't for you."
1,"If you love the songs on Noddy, DON'T BUY!!","My son was very excited as we put the CD in the player! But when the music started, he was very unhappy!! The songs don't sound anything like the ones on the show. The melody and pace are different- and the performers aren't interesting. DON'T BUY if you are familiar with the 'REAL' songs."
2,Noddy Songs from Toyland,"The CD cover shows the 'performer as Noddy'. However, the songs are sung by various artists. They liked the songs, but my grandchildren were disappointed. They thought they would hear the voices heard on the DVD's."
3,would be nice with the original songs from the show,My son loves Noddy. I thought that all the songs where the same as the show anyway my son is two and he doesn't know as much the difference but could be great if the song are the same as the show.
3,Okay,"It's not the greatest cleaner, but it did what it had to do. I don't think it will last very long however. I needed to get into my USB port with a Qtip to clean it all the way."
3,It's okay,"This is a good product for the price...but, I can only use 2 of the cleaning sticks because I only have USB ports & SD card slots. Also, it needs ones for things that plug into the USB ports like flash drives & cables & stuff, & one for micro SD card slots like card readers & micro SD card adapters, & any other types of plug ins & slots that a computer has. It could definitely be improved upon to add to it's usefulness. Other than that it works great on the things I can use it on."
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. A total rip off.","This 52 minute video is nothing more than 8-10 minutes of bad content on a loop. It is a video of one woman doing sing-along style songs. Any claims that this is a ""Sign Language"" video are dubious at best. There are very few real American Sign Language signs, so few as to be pointless. An episode of Blues Clues has more signs. I feel ripped off, and I didn't even pay any money of out my own pocket (I was using $15 in free Amazon Unbox credit from a promotion). Stay away from this video at all costs. I highly recommend Signing Time, which isn't yet available from Amazon Unbox. I hope it will be soon; I'm going to send the makers of Signing Time an email asking them to get their content online."
4,Signing Songs - a solid introduction to signing,"The DVD Signing Songs introduces children to the benefits of using signs to express themselves through movement, sign language and music. Although signs in this video are not exact, it does provide those learning disabled children an opportunity to start the process of learning how to use their bodies and hands to communicate while having fun at the same time. Lesley Ketcham, a Board Certified Music Therapist, highlights and explains the signs that will be used in the song, then sings while using each sign. She has a lovely singing voice, and for those who have not been introduced to signing videos, Signing Songs would be a great place to start!"
3,"Enjoyed it, but not quite there.","I've just finished re-reading Winged Victory. I enjoyed it, but I would have liked it better if had more focus. It had some technology, (not enough for me -- I'm a gadget person) but probably too much for people who aren't looking for that. As for the people side, I didn't really feel I came away knowing the players (as I have with Perrett's other books). Some coverage of the politcal goings on, but I wanted more. At times the book seemed to drag with recitations of 'so many sorties, so many shot down one day, more sorties, more planes lost the next.'But I don't mean to be so negative -- I did enjoy the book (and am re-reading it) and can recommend the paperback version to anybody with an interest in the subject. Mr Perrett does write very well."
2,It could be better,"Thw writer has done a marvellous job, writing the history of USAAF in one volume only, in a modern and acesible language. But there are two serious flaws: 1)there are no apendix, which could include the number of planes built, destroyed in combat, the number of enemy plane shot down, number of enlisted men at end of war, etc, etc.. 2)The photo session is so small, so ridiculous, that it should have been better to have no photos at all."
5,An unbiased history,One of the best books you will find on the Army Air Force prior to and during World War II. This is one of the few authors that doesn't impose his opinions on the reader. He goes out of his way to give both sides of an issue or a personality. Even such controversial figures as Britain's Bernard Montgomery or our own Douglas MacArthur are treated with an even-handedness that is all too rare. Very entertaining and very informative.
2,Check the facts,"I picked up this book because I was researching my grandfather, who was a B-17 pilot shot down over Switzerland. I looked this up in the book, and immediately found inaccurate information. The author claims that only 10 crews made it to Switzerland in March of 1944, yet when my grandfather was shot down on 18 March 15 other crews were interned by the Swiss on the same day, the highest number in the entire war. The author also claims that many of the bombers landed with little or no damage, insinuating that they were intentionally getting out of the war. This is also false- the AAF conducted an extensive investigation during the war, and found that almost every bomber that landed in Switzerland had extensive damage. I'm not sure where the information in the book came from, but it is incorrect. Any crewman interned in Swizerland could have set the record straight in that regard, and there are plenty of them around who belong to the Swiss Internees Association."
2,Not real history,"This guy does not check his facts with primary sources and has many axes to grind. He has admited in interviews that he is not really an historian, but is rather a writer with research assistants and relies mostly on secondary sources. Useful only to those who know not where else to go. Really has it in for the B-29 and Hap Arnold."
5,Ok massager,"I bought this foot massager because I needed a footrest for my ijoy100 massage chair. I used it couple times after a long walk in the mall,and it soothed my aching legs. My sister bought it two years ago, and she said it improved the circulation on her legs."
4,"This ""Review"" Will Not Be Helpful","Is Jennifer Warnes doomed to do movie music to make a few bucks? With that crystal voice of hers, why doesn't somebody write this broad some good commercial songs where she can show what she's got?"
4,Lou Reed stands the test of time.,"I'm a big Lou Reed fan. I have a couple of his live CD's. I find that he is better live than in the studio. And, this DVD reaffirms that fact for me.It's an excellent playlist, and the energy just continues to grow as the concert progresses. I wish that the concert was longer. That would be my only complaint. The DVD left me wanting just a little bit more to complete the experience.The sound quality is excellent, and the filming is well done in a minimalist way, which is appropriate for the forum in which Lou Reed is playing."
1,sad,"a long time lou reed fan was so looking forward to recieving this dvd. if you are entrenched into the talent and feeling and soul of the lou reed album rocknroll animal, you will be so disapointed with this dvd. sweet jane and rocknroll i swear could be played better by a holiday inn cover band. save your money."
5,"IT ""s GREAT ( realy)","hey i love it but im an old horror movie fan , if you lov the clissic horrors you'll lov this , it realy is great , i love it ,"
5,Highly recommend :),"I love this book because it allowed me to see just how much I have been limiting myself. I enjoyed learning the techniques to achieving your visualizations. The author makes valid points and talked about many specific subjects that I have been questioning recently and even experiencing, so that has helped me directly address the issues. Overall, I'd hiiighly recommend"
5,Thank you for this book,"Just received this book today 11/23/11, will get to reading it over the holiday, since school is closed and I need something interesting to read. The notes in the book will help me to decide on new ideas for the coming year. Thanks."
4,"Not bad, but get the originals",A complete set list with the artists and timings:1. Back of A Car / Gin Blossoms (1:59)2. Nightime / Afghan Whigs (3:29)3. Ballad of El Goodo / Matthew Sweet (3:08)4. Don't Lie To Me / Juliana Hatfield (2:15)5. You Get What You Deserve / Idle Wilds (2:16)6. Give Me Another Chance / Whiskeytown (3:05)7. When My Baby's Beside Me / Kelly Willis (2:12)8. Jesus Christ / Teenage Fanclub (2:06)9. What's Goin Ahn / The Posies (2:27)10. Thirteen / Wilco (2:29)11. Hot Thing / Big Star (3:04)
1,"Where's ""The Myth of Working Fathers""?","The author's message, in essence, is that working mothers are not ""real"" mothers. I can only assume that in the sequel to this sexist, essentialist rant, she will reveal how working fathers are not ""real"" fathers, and how they should build *their* careers around parenthood, and how they are sadly mistaken to think they could possibly be successful both in the labor force and at home."
1,What a stupid book!,Don't waste your money on this book unless you want to be insulted. Just because women work does not mean they can't be great moms. Finding quality daycare is key! My children loved their daycare providers and they loved playing with other kids. I like working and being a mom! I think I'm pretty good at it too!
3,Another viewpoint,"Has anyone tried working at home while your children are in the house - very difficult, even when Dad is there. Also, seems like Ms. Venker has a very fulfilling, albeit 'part-time' career for herself - wouldn't we all have the best of both worlds too if we could? Can someone please tell me where these part-time jobs are, and where I can find child care that will be less than the income I would make? Or in fact a career that I can leave for several years, then walk back into later on when my children no longer need me around full time. (We should learn these necessities in school). Some ridiculous suggestions as well as some solid basis for making the decision which weighs heavy on the minds of all working and stay at home moms."
1,Leaks,If your drive thru mud and rain expect water to get in this bag. It is not very water resistant.
4,Interesting idea...,"I got one of these back in the mid 1990s. It makes pretty good clear pictures that are auto-developing and rather sharp for their size. However, it uses its own type of film and nothing else and I ran into a snag when I let them pile up in a back pocket designed into the camera. The pictures got stuck in there and I ended up ruining a couple trying to pull them out. I imagine others who bought one of these might have run into similar issues. It's not the greatest idea Polaroid came out with, but not a bad attempt."
4,Delightful Introduction,"""Social Things"" is a delightful introduction to the field of sociology--an engaging read for anyone interested in the field. It's exceptionally clear and readable, with a brief history highlighted by the contributions of major theorists and schools of thought. But the author's charming and personable voice enlivens the journey and makes it a fascinating and pleasurable excursion. No one need be intimidated!"
4,Native American Herbal Remedies,"I thought that this book was informative. He describes the herb, and the tribe(s) that used it, and how. There is several pages on the tribal tradition, but I would have liked to have seen more indepth about several of the more common tribes and their herbal medicinal usage and practices.I really appreciated the author bringing together how the whole person must be treated in order to treat dis-ease. This is really missing in allopathic medicine.I would recommend this book to any herbal practitioner that would like a different view of herbal treatment, using traditional Native American ways.Kathy Miller"
2,Disappointing book. Not what I expected......,"Just another book with huge text and lots of wasted space (that makes you think you are getting a lot of reading material).Unfortunately, not much info in this book. If you are looking for a simple, down-to-earth useful book, this really isn't it.Perhaps the other book I ordered, ""Healing Secrets of the Native Americans: Herbs, Remedies, and Practices That Restore the Body, Refresh the Mind, and Rebuild the Spirit"" [Hardcover] will have more useful info. If it ever gets here that is :(My verdict? ""Secrets of Native American Herbal Remedies: comph GT Native amern Tradition Using Herbs Mind/Body/Spirit Connection for ipvg (Healing Arts)"" [Paperback] is a complete waste of money."
5,Secrets of Native American herbal Remedies,A very good comprhreshive book. It has a lot of common problems that you may come across with. A very good reference.
4,i miss the original formula but this isn't bad,I first started using scar zone when the original formula without the green tea came out. This version with the green tea seems to take longer to produce results for me so it's like you have to use more of the product to see a change. Scar zone is reasonably priced compared to mederma so I would definitely recommend it.
2,HPL would be spinning,"This book is okay, but Brown Jenkin is not what I saw when I read HPL's ""Dreams in the Witch House.""It's not a good Masterton book, either. The last 30 pages seem as if he had to get it done fast, or be sued by the publisher.Skip it. ""Spirit"" is a lot better."
2,"Started well, then...","turned into a totally different story. I liked the beginning, but closer to the ending i could not believe that was the same book. There were good ideas that were abandoned by the writer, and the characters acted stupid most of the time.I do not reccomend this book."
3,An Average Quality Pastiche,"A rather average Lovecraft pastiche. While at times effective, Masterton took excessive liberties with quite a bit of the mythos. The end result is disappointing for someone familiar with the original works."
3,Interesting Lovecraft Mythos tale,"I only have a couple of words for this book. First it is a interesting read and enjoyable to a point. The ""point"" is that the chracters are so INCREDIBLY STUPID that you want them all to just get maimed and murdered. God i did not know that dialogue could be this terrible. And another thing the ending was absolutely horrible, i mean after going through this whole book and putting up with the [bad] dialogue and finally the suspense it barely manages to build you would think you would get a explosive and entertaining climax. You would be wrong, completely and utterly wrong. The ending is pointless and the author obviously ran out of ideas or didnt really care. He should be ashamed of himself. H.P. Lovecraft Mythos tie ins deserve better and the stupid sex scenes make me want to vomit. ..."
5,Set me free!,"This will with no noubt be one of the classics. It's just perfect. The baseline is an sultry invitation to dance. Kylies gentle vocals do right to those innovative lyrics. ""There's a dark secret in me don't keep locked in your heart. Set me free!"" What can one do but dance to trance as long as this song stays on. The original verison needs nothing more. It's only just so short. And that la-la-la will go on forever!More eighties retro this one. The follow up ""In your eyes"" has more true disco flair."
3,It's Missing Something Amazon Says It Has...,"NOTE: Don't click no if you already have this CD.Part One has the enhanced video, NOT the part two with remixes. This CD has some fairly bad remixes on it. The second track, the K&M; remix, is more than 6 minutes, and it drags on. It's decent with the words it has. The second is over 10 minutes, the Plastika remix, is just horrible. It has only the chorus and the la la la's. For over ten dollars, you should get part one with two bonus tracks, the album version of CGYOOMH and the enhanced video, which is just awesome.BOTTOM LINE: She needs some new remixers."
4,I finally got this review out of my head!,"This is another track that I first heard on ""Open House Party"" with John G. that caught my attention. This song sounds like a slightly uptempo version of Fragma's ""Toca's Miracle""(because of the subtle background guitar-plucking efx) or DJ Jurgen's ""Higher & Higher"". It seems more poppy than it does dance. The beat makes you want to bob your head along with it. I really dig Kylie's voice which sounds like a combo of Maria Rubia and DaMae from Fragma. The lyrics may be a little repetitive for some(this is why I gave it 4 of 5 stars). Although this makes them easy to learn, and stick with you. It's a catchy track, that's for sure! This single is better than the other because they included the album version and 2 remixes, instead of the album version and 2 other trax. I wish they would have put a couple of extra remixes on here, though... I do recommend giving this single a listen. You might not be able to get this song out of your head!..."
5,Kylie returns,"Years after her hit in the US (and with a steadily growing career in Europe and else where in the world) Kylie Minogue returns to the airwaves with a dance hit that is catchy and hypnotic. At first I was only slightly interested in this tune but the more I heard it, the more I like it. I'm looking foward to the entire cd and I hope it is filled with great dance songs like this one."
5,It's Never Too Late to Review This Single.,"As someone who's been following Kylie since her late 1980s, Stock Aitken Waterman years, I was one happy camper when I learned that ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" blasted into the US Top Ten. After a disastrous cover of ""The Locomotion,"" Kylie quickly disappeared from the American spotlight while she attained superstardom in the UK. Over the years, she tried to win American audiences back, but with no such luck. Then, years later, came this single, a hypnotic slice of disco minimalism with its undeniable ""la la la"" hook. Having topped the charts in the UK and in a few other countries, it was poised for similar success stateside. After a long absence, we Americans should be so lucky that we have Kylie back ruling the charts again. ""I Can't Get You Out Of My Head"" is one of the best and most memorable singles of this, or any other, year."
5,Oh...Oh....OH!!!!! Oh!!!! YEAH!! Kylie you did it again!!!!!!!!!,"Kylie Minogue is so freakin' HOT that everytime i see her i wanna get naked and ""Can't get you out of my head"" is so darn sexy.It's got a pulsating strutting groove that gets your blood boiling and makes you wanna get on the dance floor and do your thang.,This is primo pop dressed up in a super dance groove and it will get any party cookin guaranteed.Personally i recommend getting the entire ""Fever"" album which will have you on the floor panting for air from all of it's wet and juicy musical savage foreplay.OUCH!Tell Kylie you want the fever and prepare yourself to be cooked to a crisp with Kylie's hot sexy grooves."
2,The Olsens' movies are just getting more and more pathetic!,"I'm very, very sorry to say this, but THIS MOVIE IS RIDICULOUS. THERE IS NO PLOT, NO MORAL LESSON, NO NOTHING. I can understand the part how Sam and Emma switch teams because they were upset with how they were placed, but after that it was like, hello? Where's the rest of the story? The acting was pretty good but the actual plot (or lack of it) totally stunk!"
3,Very Cute!,"As all of the Olsen Twins movies are, this one is really cute! I have to be honest and say I don't think of any of their movies can actually pass as good, or fantastic considering that I'm a bit too old for their movies but they definitely talented and have quite a few cute, funny movies up their sleeve.This movie basically revolves around boys, soccer and cute clothes and not much else. It has a plot and storyline and everything but not much quality to it. There's not particular climax though their is a so-called climax towards the end where you can actually sense what is going to happen so makes it less exciting.Personally, if your looking for a GOOD movie, you should go and look for something else but if your looking for a good twins from the Olsen Twins, try ""Passport To Paris"" or ""Billboard Dad"" which were a pleasant surprise to me."
4,"""Switching Goals"" is OK...","It's a great movie but not as good as the others. It has some action and, being a soccer fan, the soccer games and practices were cool. It was OK and that's why it needed 4 stars- it just wasn't as good as the others."
4,can't stand those male co-stars,I think this movie was great! I just couldn't stand the bad acting of the guy mary-kate's character liked. He seemed to be angry at her even when they were just talking. yuck!
2,bad acting,"This movie had bad acting. The dad is dramactic and corney. The mom is just corney, and all of the soccer coaches are acting like it was big pro sports championship. The olson twins were corny but entertaining to watch. This movie is unrealistic that Emma (ashley) and Sam Mary Kate were on 2 different teams. (It's a rule that siblings be on same sports team) This movie has bad quality actors and a unrealistic plot."
4,Switching Goals - a very good movie,"Switching goals was very good. The plot was better than the average Mary Kate and Ashley movie, but it wasn't as funny or had as good of acting as the others. This movie is good to watch a couple of times, but only a couple times. If you have extra cash though, I say get it. You won't regret it."
3,Okay i guess....,"this movie was okay i guess....im 11 and i really think i'm getting too old for the olsen twins....even there new movie New York Minute was way too ""young""ish letz just say this movie is very very PREDICTABLE! i only bought this movie becuase i thought it was about SOCCER! ok only about 5 minutes out of the whole movie shows soccer...the is mostly boyz,switching places,boyz,and what a suprise...BOYZ! when they filmed this movie they musta been about 12....who makez such a predictable movie for young girlz about mostly BOYZ when there 12? this movie is PERFECT for 8 year old girlz who need someone to look up to....for all others....DONT BUY IT OR RENT IT"
1,"Entertaining, but freaky",My son wanted this video so we got it. There is a danger in making things that children think are REAL. Maybe a few more warnings in the video saying this is NOT real would be good.
3,Slow to Warm,Book was interesting and provided a genuine sense of life for blacks during the early part of this century. It started slow but towards the middle of the book the pace picked up and I enjoyed it more.
2,Will bore you to death,Langston Hughes is definitely a better poet than he is a novelist. I found this book to be lack luster and boring. Although you may like a character or two...in general the characters were not developed nor were they intriguing. His wording lacked the rapture that we are accustomed to him delivering.
3,It was ok,"Throughout the story you can see the talent of Langston Hughes. However, the subject was not unique or original for the current times. Granted, it may have been something special whe it was first written and published. We have all seen movies or read stories with the exact same plot; it's not worth reading if you're looking for a new story.If you want to experience the beauty of Hughes' writing then you should give this novel a chance. It's a short read at 300 pages, but the poet's talent shines through in numerous passages.This was my first exposure to the author and I will probably read more of his work along the way. Hopefully, there will be more unique story lines as I continue through his art."
5,One of a Kind,"I had to read a book for a book report due in a week. I was beginning to feel hopeless before I stumbled onto this in the library. Langston Hughes is an amazing Writer and poet. This was the first of his novels that I have read and I think it couldn't have been more perfect. This book is so rich in its characters and Hughes shows no mercy in telling of the bittersweet culture that engulfs the world of Sandy and his family. After reading this book, the beauty of this people was more evident than ever before. With words that are lovely and flowing and thoughts that are deep and abundant, Hughes is a person whom I wish was still with us."
1,Not happy,I contact the company by e mail to return the product as directed the company e mails back to ask for a reason and if the product was opened I replied and the company DID NOT what is the next step to return the product ?????????????
4,It's Lovely. . . But A Bit Light,"This watch is a beautiful one. But I am one who is used to watches having just a bit of heft. This bracelet watch LITERALLY feels like a bracelet. There is no ""heft"" to the watch. If you like that, by all means, buy it. If you don't, you might want to consider something more substantial. I love the watch, and will not return it, but the ""lightness"" takes some getting used to."
1,There's gold in that there cave,"A bunch of white dudes try to beat a white chick to this secret cave where there is a secret treasure of indian gold in 1869 Texas.The acting is terrible, the script is laughable and the ghost wolf looks like a cheap halloween costume. Typical low budget mistakes, trying to do a horror with no money and using non actors. I paid 99 cents for this movie and I think I overpaid by about 98 cents."
5,Putting in transforming action,"The book is an inspiring, practical Biblically-based manual for moving fromcharity to transformation of community. It is enriched by practical examplesfrom real life experiences in low income communities and working with people with soundtheological underpinnings. It is inspiring;one feels hopeful and notdependent on experts, but that transformation, step by step, can happenwith committed people inspired by hope and small first successes. A mustbook for people working in low income communities, especially with faithconnections."
3,Great Sound but NO Battery Backup!,This could have easily been a five star unit if the manufacturer would have added a simple battery back-up feature. What good is an alarm clock if it looses it's settings in the middle of the night? (experience talking......)I'm simply amazed at the number of companies (including Sony) who obviously don't think this is a necessity. Sound is very good and the CD seems to be very well thought out. FM tuner is also very nice.
4,Excellent sound,"The sound quality of this rivals the Bose tabletop; certainly its a better value for the price. Its not as attractive and a little larger, but the features are well placed and the remote is very useful.Mine got damaged by a bad surge, so if you get one, use a surge protector with it to preserve it."
4,I own one and I want another!!!,"I bought one at Target and I wish I had bought two. Now they are out of stock and I can't find one. For the price, this product delivers fine sound. I agree with some previous reviewers on the issue of the battery, but that is a minor point. I love the sound!!! It also has good radio reception for stations that are at the fringe of the FM reception band. I did not buy it as a clock radio, but as a less expensive alternative to Bose. At $400 less than the comparable Bose, I say ""go for it'! I hope it is available soon."
2,Definitive of what?,"A bad idea?I agree with Kireviewer, if you care about the music, it's hard to get past the dumb opening, a host who even Will Rodgers couldn't like, a set apparently built in a high school shop class, and the many annoying interruptions. They took a too short concert, and turned it into a bad, too long music video. I guess the mindless filler was necessary to get the length up to the claimed 1 hour. The music is OK, but it was neither the band's best period, nor their best work."
2,How could this happen.....,"Jefferson Starship at the time(1983)had released 3 outstanding albums, Freedom at Point Zero, Modern Times, Wind of Change. If anyone had the opportunity to see the band with drummer Ansley Dunbar, You know how disappointing this video is. Unfortunately, when listening to songs like ""Stranger"" you could hear the bands new drummer(???)the mistakes and missed drum fills. It's a shame that the band never released any Video performance of the band with Dunbar. It's a good mix of song selection. Too bad they didnt fine tune the playing.(Why didnt they play ""Save Your Love"" ""Lightening Rose"" ""RockMusic"")"
1,"This edition is full of errors, mistakes, and typos","DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!! It is full of typos, missing information in problems, mislabeled diagrams, and wrong answers! I spoke with PR and they said that, yes, indeed that is correct, but the 2002 edition has been corrected. Can you imagine what I went through while studying? I was second guessing myself left and right. I finally realized that, no, I do what I'm doing, it's the book that was wrong.Please don't buy this 2000 edition, it is a waste of your time and money. The 2002 edition ought to be much better, and probably quite a good study guide. I, however, have not seen it and do not know for sure, but PR should be a fairly respectable test prep. company.Happy GREs...hahaha"
1,Most horrendous test prep book in press...,"Amazon should offer negative star ratings, because one star is far too glamorous a prize for this untrustworthy and erroneous book. I am shocked at the simple lack in proofreading the text, question, and answers. Students of Chem should never buy this book, and those that have should write the publisher and demand a refund. The only good use for this text would be as camp fire fuel."
1,This book is a Travesty,"With just four years of chemistry background, I could write a better book than this in my sleep. What did the authro get her Ph.D in anyway? Was it sociology, or perhaps basket weaving? I am quite bitter, becuase I am trying to use this miserable excuse for toilet paper to prep for an exam two days from now. It at least reassures me of how much I do know because all the errors are so glaring. I think that perhaps this author should also advertise that they got their Ph.D. out of a cracker jack box. I will be writing to Princeton Review to demand my money back, and I urge University Chemistry departments everywhere to warn students about this book. Honestly, a retarded monkey with no limbs could write a better book. I wonder what Laberge got on the Chem GRE?"
1,sloppy,"The topics covered are generally clear, but there are numerous errors and typos. There are bonds missing in the organic chemistry section and at least one error that is of a seriously confusing sort."
1,Not so good,"I had three books to help study for this exam including this one. This book has many errors and it also doesn't explain things very well. I don't even know if there is a good study guide out there because the one from ETS doesn't even tell you how to do the problems, it just tells you the answers."
2,sloppy,"I get that they want a standard for fitness classes, but if you dance the techniques correctly it is a workout. But just to move quickly with poor form is crazy. The more precise the movements especially the figure 8 movements the more tone on gets. The hands are ""Sloppy"" and the arms are dead weight. Shoulders are not kept away from the ears correctly. I just think you are better off buying a technique dvd with a dancer of professional performance status and drill the sequences.I found the transitions, sequencing, foot patterns and overall energy ""Sloppy"""
2,Isn't there a larger version of this game??,"This is too small for the age of child it's designed for. I swear there used to be a larger version. Plus, it didn't survive more than a few sessions of our play group before the spring broke."
2,Disappointed,"My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas gift. Once it was initally set-up he had a blast when the teeth chomped down on his finger (very gentle). However, after 2 rounds of play we were unable to get the teeth to pop back up or to get the rest of the teeth to push down. Needless to say he was very disappointed as was I. Does not appear to be very durable or we just got a bad one."
2,Item seemed like it was used not a new product!,Item seemed like it was used not a new product! Oh well it is just a cheap toy and the kids will probably tear it up in a couple of weeks anyway!
1,Cheaply made,"I bought this for my son after remembering when I played it when I was younger. I looked at tons of different ones to see which one I should get. I bought this one and it came broken. I tried to fix it but even after it should've worked again, it would still let you put all the teeth down without the crocodile biting. This one is also very small. I went to Toys R Us and bought the one they sell, which I was nervous to do since you couldn't see what's inside the box, but that one is perfect and exactly what I was looking for, plus it doesn't actually ""bite"" so my little ones won't be too afraid to play it."
1,do not waste your money,"i purchased this thinking it was the ORIGINAL crocodile dentist. this one is FAR FROM IT. first of all, it is about the size of my hand. yes, very very very small. it does not take batteries. you simply ""push"" the teeth down with your finger one at a time and when you press a certain tooth, it trigger the jaw to close on your finger. but, the jaw is held open with just a spring attachement which often malfunctions. and when the jaw closed on my sons little finger (only 3), the top part of the crocodile just fell off. it is CHEAPLY MADE! the picture is also misleading - this one has braces. i do not remember the original crocodile dentist having braces on its top teeth. completely bored my son."
1,crap,"This toy came in poor shape - the plastic was broken and it was dirty - suppose to be ""new"" - It has not even been one month and the toy is brok"
5,Great for young kids,"I love this game! I bought one 15 or so years ago when my son was young, good first game as it helps teach turn taking. Little kids love it when the crocodile ""bites"" you! Even timid kids get into the game after an adult gets bitten a few times. Bonus that it's portable, no loose pieces, I purchased this one for my niece's three sons (under the age of 5) and have given it as a gift over and over, really fun game."
3,Not the old Crocodile Dentist!!,"This is not the Crocodile dentist i had as a child! It is half the size and a bit cheap looking, but still fun and there are no loose pieces so it can be taken anywhere"
2,horrible!,"this is very cheap, broke almost right out of the package. I bought it to work with kids at church, a fun game to use with singing time. It didn't even make it 1/2 way around the room. A tooth stuck down, it wouldn't allow the mouth to stay open. My son was able to fix it by unscrewing the base and fiddling with it. So not worth the price. It's much smaller than I had expected. Very expensive for what it is. I only expect it to break again, so I am going to return it."
1,very small and lasted about 1 hour,"I was really excited about this toy. Unfortunately, it was very small and lasted maybe 2 hours before breaking. Excessively cheap construction. Worth it only if you find it in the dollar store (toy was maybe 6-8 in nose to tail)"
3,Much smaller than I expected. Wouldn't have paid what I did,"I was a bit disappointed with this toy and so was my 5 yr old. When I recieved it I opened the package expecting to find something worth the near $20 I spent. Christmas day, my son lost interest in it about 10 minutes after opening it. It's been a table decoration in his room ever since. Perhaps this toy is better suited for a 2 or 3 yr old and the cost should be closer to $10 instead of $20."
4,Cute but overpriced,"I got this as a gift for my 5yr old and he loves it. It's cute, but smaller than you'd think and definitely overpriced at $13.99 plus shipping. In a store, I wouldn't pay more than half of that price for this toy. Be prepared: the top jaw slams down on your finger, and while my son doesn't cry (it doesn't really hurt so much as it surprises you), he does yell ""ouch"" ...And then continues playing with it. The tooth that makes the crocodile ""bite"" is random so you never know which one it'll be. The game goes quickly and can be fun for the entire family, which is nice when it's so hard to find games that not only appeal to the whole family, but can be played by families with age ranges from preschool children to older adults. It's a great way to squeeze a family game in on a busy weeknight. It works as a travel game too, since there are no loose pieces and it's a fairly small size."
3,Crocodile Dentist review,"The toy is fun for the kids to play with an adult. The plastic is hard, but seem sturdy. We have extras, just in case the kids are too rough with it."
3,Scary for little ones,I thought this game was fun but my three year old daughter was terrified of it. My husband and I would play it together to show her how fun it is but she wouldn't even stay in the same room with it. So maybe not the best idea for little girls. I did give it three stars because I think it would be fun for kids who are not afraid of it. :)
3,A little scary,"Before I bought this item, I read the readers' reviews because I thought it might be scary for a pre-schooler to stick his hand in a crocodile's mouth. Based on viewers' comments that children loved this game, I purchased it for a 3-year-old, who is usually quite bold. He has no intention of sticking his hand in that crocodile's mouth. He enjoys watching other people do it, but what's the sense of a toy he won't play with?"
2,"Fun, but fragile","My oldest got this for his 5th birthday. He and his 3yo brother played with it non-stop! It was a huge hit. But now here we are just a week later and the crocodile won't keep his mouth open :( The kids still play with it, but of course not nearly as much. They just hold his mouth open and push all the teeth down, then ignore it for the most part. Part of me wants to buy another, but I'm worried about it just breaking again."
2,Just OK,"I guess it's my own fault for not really reading the description, but this thing is TINY. Was fun enough but the kids (3 & 4) figured out which tooth was the ""bad"" one after @ 30 seconds of playing with it. Not worth the money."
2,It's great when it works,"I specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose. It was to be taken on a trip to visit with my 5 year old grandson. What fun! We laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns. Well, after less than a day the only tooth that would cause the jaws to snap was the center tooth. Not too much fun there. I feel I wasted my money."
3,Cute! But very small!,"I bought one for my three yr. old. Yes, it is fun. But my daughter has no fear. If your child is a little frightened over animals, this is not the toy for them. It lightly chomps at the finger the pushes the wrong tooth down. That's the fun of it. My daughter thinks it is sooo funny. The toy I bought from Amazon was very small and I spent too much. Buy it at Target for the larger version."
2,Piece of junk,"It broke, I swear, the second time my child touched the teeth. I have never seen a toy do that. Maybe I just got a lemon."
1,Travel Sized --- Not what I expected,"So disappointed - this is a travel version. It should be advertised as such. It won't last through Christmas morning if it's even looked at! I have contacted the seller as to my disappointment in hopes to obtain the real game or a full refund, I will post the result."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"I bought this toy to give my grandson for his birthday. It was ordered in October for his December birthday. I decided to open it before I mailed it to see how it worked. Well, it did not work at all. I opened the mouth and some of the time the teeth all pop up but most of the time 6 to 8 stay down. When they all popped up, then I thought it should work as described. It did not. I have never gotten the mouth to close when I pushed a tooth down. It is a piece of junk! Since I did not check it out until after Thanksgiving, I can not return it for the full price. By the time I pay for postage I would loose even more so I'll just trash it! What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!"
5,Children Love Crocodile Dentist !,"I bought this for my three children and they all loved it, it was well used for years. It was still in good shape after years of use so I put it in storage. I came across it, and I thought the students I teach might like it. I teach middle school. I put this on my desk and the students race to be the first in the class to play. They loved it so much, I went on Amazon and bought more! I have 5 on my desk, they are used daily by 100's of students, they are dropped almost daily. Students are not late to class. Students do not get tired of this quick fun and durable game. You should purchase this, it is perfect for on top of a desk, kids of every age love it!"
2,Doesn't work,"I bought this game for my children at Christmas and it didn't work from the second we pulled it from the package. The teeth get stuck and the mouth doesn't close most of the time. I didn't return it because it would cost more to deal with than I paid for it. Maybe I just got a bad one, who knows. My kids still play with it (they are only 3) but not the way it was meant to be played with. I would recommend just going with the full sized one, not the travel size."
5,Perfect Gift...,"this was a gift for a 4 year old - she loves it, and the best part is that she can play it solo as well!! Not the most edicational toy, but a great game to keep the kids busy."
3,Cute but not as high quality as kids need,I bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas and when we opened it the top jaw was disconnected. My husband was able to reconnect it but now we feel like it has to be more protected than most toys and wonder how long before it breaks. It is small and cute and quite a bit of fun although the fun is very short lived.
3,"The ""Little"" Chomper","Great for the crocodile/alligator loving child. Wonderful at creating suspense with every push of a tooth. Grandson enjoys the anticipation of the ""chomp"". I did not realize when I ordered it that it was not like the original Crocodile Dentist, so was a little disappointed. It pleased the grandson so it did what was intended."
4,Smaller than the original but fun,"I ordered this product because my daughter loved her cousins. Strangely, when I received it I was surprised that it was a MUCH smaller version than the one her cousin has! I bumped down the durability because of this. It is more of a travel version but it is still a fun game with a nice element of surprise. My daughter enjoyed this at the age of 2-3."
3,Crocodile Dentist,"I purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas thinking it was a regular size game so she could learn to take turns. However, I was somewhat disappointed in the size of the game - it is definitely a travel size. I don't believe it was worth the money plus shipping for this product."
2,Fun idea bad design,It was a good idea my son was scared to even try it though. Once he started playing with it then the top part of the mouth came off. I rarely find it in one piece. My 18 month old is the only one really interested in playing with it for the most part.
1,May not appeal to toddler,"My 3-year old toddler loved playing ""snatch-the-toast"" from her toy toaster so I bought her the crocodile dentist. However, she is scared stiff of the clamping action and refused to play with it. She started removing the sticker-eyes and -nostrils instead. Toy is durable per se but stickers can be easily removed. I had to glue them back with superglue, which is better lasting. I came to a conclusion that she is still too young to play with the crocodile dentist and I intend to keep it for her later on."
1,Cheap Plastic,This toy did not last 1 day. The spring mechanism inside broke after about the 5th game we played. I wouldn't waste my money on it again. We were pretty careful with since it felt cheap right out of the box. After the 5th game the mouth would not stay open anymore.
1,Instantly broke,"We had a larger ""Crocodile dentist"" toy that my 2 and 4 year old really loved playing with. After a month or two the toy broke so you couldn't play the game. I bought this as replacement. It is very small and the game never worked - you push all of the teeth and the mouth never shuts. It's a shame because the concept of this game is great. But don't buy this one"
3,thought it was a full size :(,"I paid 30 dollars for this product, there was no notification that it was a SMALL or TRAVEL sized crocodile dentist. So when i received it, i was pretty disappointed. It doesnt have the full effect of the original crocodile dentist :("
1,disappointed,We played with this gift three tiems and it broke. Very poorly made. Would buy if I could find a better quality product becasue the game itself is quite funny.
2,Not enough info,"The description didn't say that it was the small version! I wanted the bigger version. Doesn't work that great, either."
2,Bad purchase,This is not a very good toy. Sometimes it catches and works but mostly not. Should of listened to reviews. They were right.
1,doesn't live up to expectations,"Since this game gave no dimensions, I had to guess at it's size. From the photos that I saw, I assumed that the toy would be bigger then it actually was. It is small, about the size of my fist. The idea of the game is to keep pressing teeth until you reach the sore one, at which time the jaw will snap shut. However, the jaw very frequently pops off completely when snapping shut and requires an adult to put it back together. The teeth often do not reset after the jaw has snapped shut and have to be manually pried back into position to be able to play again. All in all, a disappointment and not worth the money it would cost to send it back."
1,piece of junk,We played this game twice and it broke. The teeth won't come back up and the mouth won't stay open. Save your money.
3,Fun that gets a little old pretty quick.,"This toy was a lot of fun... for the first day or so. It's a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be. But, it does exactly what it is supposed to. It doesn't hurt when it snaps shut, just startles a little. The problem is, how many times can you really push the buttons until it snaps and still have fun? It is pretty useful for making decisions. Who ever makes the crock snap has to clean the playroom!!"
3,croc fun beware,I gave this toy to my six year old grandson. He was a little scared when the mouth would close and his three year old brother was even more scared. I think they will have to save this toy until they are a little older. They were afraid it would hurt their fingers when the mouth snapped shut. It did not hurt but the sudden snap even gave me a scare.
2,Not what I was hoping for...,"This simple game works exactly as stated: players take turns pushing the teeth in until the jaw snaps shut. However, I was disappointed at how small and cheap this game is. It's about as large as an adult's hand and seems like it could break very easily. I would've felt better about this size and quality level if it would have cost about half the amount I paid."
2,Boring...,"the title says it all. My 2.5 yr old son was not that interested in the first place, completely stopped playing with it after 30 minutes. It now sits with a pile of toys collecting dust."
2,Scary,"I bought it for 2 1/2 old, and she hates it, she is soooo scared of it, she cannot even see it, maybe she will be ready in 10 years"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this toy. It was a travel size and I was expecting a bigger size. I had seen the larger version and was really looking forward to giving it to my daughter. As is turns out, she was a little scared of it anyway, so she probably would have really been scared of the larger one. Anyway, it is a great toy, but I would prefer the larger version."
1,Crocodile Dentist,"It started out being fun, but was too hurtful to little fingers. It's not being played with as much as I thought it would, but it was what they asked for. Another toy for the garage sale."
4,cute toy,Our son will be getting this for X-mas. He loves crocodiles so we are looking forward to playing it with him.
2,Disappointed,"My 7 year old son with special needs is very interested in anything related to dentistry (books about going to the dentist, the books Open Wide and Dr. DeSoto, ...) so we were really hoping this toy would get his attention too. However, it is just not very entertaining and it is also very fragile. The teeth would get stuck from the first day we opened it and after dropping it a couple of times, it broke apart, so we are no longer able to use it anyway.Unfortunately, this toy was a dud at our home."
1,Broke after a week,"A tooth fell out but could still play it. Then another tooth fell out (can't replace) so made the game even less playable. Also, it was really tiny and more like a travel size which I did not expect for the money."
1,unhappy,"don't buy this, broke out of the box,poor quality item, dissapointed child,worst present ever,stay away from this game not worth the time or money"
3,This is a TRAVEL SIZE version,"I was under the impression that this was the full size version since nowhere in the ad did it state it was travel size. With that being said, t is still much fun for my 2 and a half year old. She loves the surprise chomp."
3,Way too small,"I ordered the Crocodile Dentist game and was amazed at how small the game is. I looked again at the packaging too see if I had ordered the traveling size. The picture on the back of the game has the head of the crocodile larger than the little boy face pictured in the back ground.Overall the game was fun, but not worth the amount paid for it."
2,NOT the Crocodile Dentist you think you're getting. China replica.,"I'm very upset after receiving my ""Crocodile Dentist"" game. Once I got it out of the Amazon box, I realized right away that this was not the game made by Hasbro sold in the US. It's very obvious just from looking at the game box, which is cheap, says ""CrocoDileDentist"" on it, and is full of oddly-phrased sentences with typos, punctuation errors, and grammer mistakes. The toy does work, but it is VERY cheaply made. If I wanted this toy, I could have gone to alibaba.com and ordered one from China myself for 1.75. Instead I paid 11 dollars for the REAL toy, and got this one. As another reviewer said, it does have a ""used"" look about it right out of the package. Especially on the bottom of the toy. I am very disapointed. I've never had an experience like this on Amazon, and I've bought hundreds of items. This seller gives this sitea bad name."
1,broken when I opened the box,"When I opened the box, I pushed down the teeth to see how hard it would clamp shut and it didn't clamp shut. I returned the toy to the company and will not be purchasing another one. I was originally excited about this purchase as I have seen the toy before and the kids really liked it."
3,Croc Dentist,"The game was MUCH smaller than I expected (I actually went back to review my purchase to make sure I didn't accidentally buy a travl version!). Overall, it's a cute game and my 3-yr old son enjoys it. It is easily ""broken"" (jaw becomes unhinged) but so far has been easily repaired each time."
5,so far sounds great,"I actually ended up buying these to update two old cabinets i had come across. Thought they only needed speakers, turned out there was no crossover that was why the speakers were shot in the first place. Then a friend gave me a JBL set (bass mids and highs) from an old big screen tv for free so keeping the project as low cost as possible i baught these. They have nice sound for the price did't expect the results i got out of these, and i am picky about sound and i'm very satisfied. Plus they were easy to figure out how to hook up, all the terminals are marked."
5,Awesome!,"I absoultely LOVE Mero! I just wish that they had more than one single out, because I can't get enough of them! I listen to this single over and over again without getting tired of it. It's a group of two guys, but it's not entirely pop sounding. It's just fun loving music to relax and enjoy."
1,"Beautiful music, lousy packaging","I was glad to see this disc reissued, even as a CD-R, but despite the beautiful music, I cannot recommend this disc because of the lack of any information other than the track listing. There are no liner notes, no timings and no indication of which composer wrote which piece. As these rarities will be mostly of interest to the more serious collector/listener, this is a major failing."
3,Probably of limited usefulness,"I am prejudiced by Mytile Stedman's re-release of her very dated book, Adobe Archtecture. That book, with a copyright from 1987, is actually filled with designs from the 1930's. The current volume on remodeling and fireplaces is filled with drawings, with no photos of actual structures. The house plans feature very small rooms and appear to be taken directly from the Adobe Architecture book. Many of the drawings have little content. I suspect that the subject matter is far better handled elsewhere, and that the author is trading on her name and reputation."
5,"''and by will, I mean won't!''","This series is SO hilarious. I was so upset when I found out that they cancelled it.If you watched it religiously like I did when it was airing on MTV, (2004, I believe?) then you won't de dissapointed. In it's short 13 episode run, it had plenty of laughs. You should get this. Hands down. You'll have plenty of quotes that you can share with your friends for weeks to come."
5,Great show,If you know this show that is probably why you are here and don't need me to tell you how good it is. If you are new then buy it! It is fun and never slows down. Unfortunately there is only one season.
3,Slow Moving but Sagacios,"Political Scientist James Q. Wilson is undeniable a brilliant cultural commentator. Unfortunately, most of the essays in this collection move at a snail's pace and failed to fully engage me. I would have found it more beneficial if he had employed more anecdotal vignettes rather than utilize a broad, abstract approach in addressing social problems.Most of this collection was previously released in other publications or delivered as speeches, and from what I have read of his work in the past, this selection is far from the cream of his crop.Still the crepuscular presentation does not fully obliterate the smart insights conveyed among the included passages. At times it may require that readers dig deeply to hit pay dirt, but there are some scintillating nuggets buried within these pages."
2,Ultra-bad sound quality,"This is a classic film that, alas, has not aged well. Unlike the double-vinyl release of the same show, this DVD rendering sounds like it was recorded thorugh a telephone. The DVD is, in fact, an excellent document of historical stuffs, but it suffers as a source of entertainment. The sound is simply terrible (although dated, one would think better sound could be mixed in here). Purchase only if you are a die-hard Bowie fan (like myself). If you don't know Bowie, don't start here!"
3,DVD does not help much,"Despite all the DVD possibilities, the video quality wasn't improved so much. The quality isn't so good, but it worth the fact that this concert is a historic event that SHOULD be recorded. However, the setlist is great and Mick Ronson really shows what he knows. The setlist is:1. Hang Onto Yourself2. Ziggy Stardust3. Watch That Man4. Wild-Eyed Boy From Freecloud/All The Young Dudes/Oh! You Pretty Things (MEDLEY)5. Moonage Daydream (the best one in the show; really great guitar solo; it was edited in 1982 for to put some backing vocals)6. Changes7. Space Oddity8. My Death9. Cracked Actor10. Time11. Width Of A Circle12. Let's Spend The Night Together (a Rolling Stones' song)13. Suffragette City14. White Light/White Heat (Lou Reed's song)15. Rock 'N' Roll Suicide"
2,"Don't Get Me Wrong, I Still Love Bowie","The fatal flaw of this video is not Bowie's performance (he is brilliant), but its inferior production quality. It appears to be a pathetically low-budget production, a pity considering that it was done by the same man, D.A. Pennebaker, who wonderfully documented Bob Dylan's 1965 British tour in ""Don't Look Back"" (1967). As it is, the sound quality of this Ziggy Stardust performance is quite poor, as if all the mics were positioned 250 yards away from the stage. Moreover, the camera work is at times annoyingly erratic and inappropriate. The whole production, strangely, reeks of amateurism. If this movie would have been made with, for example, the production quality of Led Zeppelin's ""The Song Remains the Same,"" it would be well worth watching. Unfortunately, the bizarre sight of Bowie himself in action is its only saving grace."
3,Pretty hilarious actually,"When this stuff was current, Bowie was the hottest, the coolest, the glam-est. Now it looks so dated, you laugh in an affectionate sort of way. It's a great memento of that era, but the video is so bad and the whole thing has such a cheesy feel that it's probably not something you'd come back to over and over. Still, it's good fun, and the hits of the day are there; it's worth a viewing or two."

Still, it's good fun, and the hits of the day are there; it's worth a viewing or two."
3,I saw Bowie during this tour. IT WAS MAGNIFICENT!,"This tape is the only record of Bowie with the Spiders from Mars. It is the next best thing to being there in spite of its unpolished state. There are some sound problems during the first two songs, and it looks more like a home movie than a concert tape. Still, for those of us who weren't there--and for those of us who were--it is a real treat! Bowie, though constantly changing and ever innovative, has never again quite captured the energy and charisma or the raw, edgy, yet refined perfection that he had while with the Spiders. Enjoy!"
4,A nice DVD,"I have this on both DVD and video and there isn't that much difference. DVD you can skip the guitar solos though and get back to David... or pause perfectly. If you do buy a DVD though, make sure you don't have the surround sound on. It sounds much much better when it's just flat together. Although this isn't a concert like you'd see today, it's still entertaining, definitely a classic. Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders just go together. I've got friends that don't know Bowie, but do know Ziggy Stardust. This is a great band, wonderful character, wonderful songs, it all comes together despite the picture quality. You can definitely just put it on and watch it, or work on something and just listen to it. It is worth the buy, especially if you love David Bowie."
4,"Great document, wish there was more classic Bowie out there","This is a wonderful documentary capturing Bowie at his absolute prime musically and creatively. The sound is excellent throughout all the performances. My only complaint is that the limitations of the 16MM film and the lenses they used severely hampered the quality of the images that were captured on stage. Quite often the lenses had issues processing the extreme colors and intensity of the lighting, so what you end up seeing is totally blown out and diffused or even out of focus. Too bad. It would be nice to see them take a better pass at restoration and release this on Bluray. Overall I would recommend for any serious Bowie fan as the music is just too good to pass up. The surround mix is fantastic, clear with a good amount of punch. Worth it just to hear the soundtrack (which I already owned on CD) in 5.1."
4,Stardust indeed,Great vid for lovers of Bowie. But this is iconic stuff. Standard material for folks interested or lovers of the form
3,ziggy&spiders,"ahhhhhh having seen the show in cleveland[lindisfarne was the opener]shame the audio just doesn't do it the justice but thx for the memories,still to this day best show i have ever!!!!!! seen or heard, it got me involved in the music industry still in it making music,producing shows,again shame the audio was not up to todays standards,but still history"
3,What a Shame,"I bought this video, which was shot at Bowie's peak. As another reviewer mentioned, the quality is sooo poor you wish you didn't buy it. With zillions of hours of high-quality video of Bowie existing, why was this SH&T released?"
2,disappointing,"One of the first DVDs I ordered and of those first few, the one I most looked forward to. But, after making all the adjustments I could think of I could not make the sound (or video for that matter) quality acceptable. As much as I adore David Bowie, I haven't even been able to watch this even once all the way through. I did notice that the favorable reviews were for the VHS version of this film. Too bad, such potential!"
3,"LOVE YOU BOWIE, BUT DON'T LOVE THIS!!!","This (honestly) has to be the worst concert Dvd,I've ever seen. It's very crappy quality. The only thingI really like is the live version of the songs. Very horriblefilming. They must have been high or something. They show theauidence (and that's good), but you can hardly even see thembecause the picture is so damn dark! Bowie's last ZIGGY gigcould have had a lot more effort into it to be a 100% bettergig. They show some of the occasinal backstage scenes.His costumes are kind of cool. Here are the songs:1. Intro, 2. Hang On To yourself, 3. Ziggy Stardust, 4. WatchThat man, 5. Wild Eyed Boy From Free Cloud, 6. All The YoungDudes, 7. Oh You Pretty Things, 8. Moonage Daydream, 9. Changes10. Space Oddity, 11. My Death, 12. Cracked Actor, 13. Time,14. Width Of A Circle, 15. Band Introduction, 16. Let's SpendThe Night Together, 17. Suffergate City, 18. White Light/WhiteHeat, 19. Farewell Speech, 20. Rock N Roll Suicide, 21. EndCredits."
3,Where Is The ENCORE ????????,"When I originally saw this concert on TV as a teen - it concluded with a blistering encore of Jean Genie by Mick Ronson assisted by his idol Jeff Beck. It looked like a scene orchestrated by Vince McMahon of wrestling fame with each of the guitar slingers firing blazing riffs back and forth at each other. Did Bowie leave this off because of some kind of Beck-ola pay-ola? Did the amazing Ronson, like the lighters that bear his name, shine too brighty at the end of the concert? Only David knows for sure. There can be no conclusion to this show without that finale. Why reissue it yet still incomplete. Check your local boot-legger for this missing cherry. Deliberate omissions like this is why the fans deserve some kind legal swapping of discarded gems!"
3,I`ve read better,"IT WAS OK AND i`M SPEAKING OUT 4 ALL PONY PAL BOOKS.THEY ALMOST NEVER GET INTO FIGHTS.AND THEY NEVER HAVE HAD TO EXPIERIENCE REALLY BAD STUFF SUCH AS DIVORCE AND PRANKS OR SELL ONE OF THEIR PONIES.IT WOULD BE COOL IF THEIT WOULD BE JR. PONY PALS WITHMIMI,ROSALIE(IF SHE EVER GETS A PONY)EVE,AND PAM`S SIBLINGS.ALSO READ THE SADDLE CLUB THAT`S ALL I HAVE TO SAY."
3,Cool for little guys,"This is a really neat little set that is perfect for little hands. I was half-way expecting the knife and axe to be super flimsy plastic like the dollar store stuff, but it's actually pretty sturdy. I gave this product 3 stars because the binoculars are very blurry and almost impossible to look out of and the flashlight is very cheap, barely works. But everything else is neat and my 4-year-old seems to love it (especially the compass watch & axe)."
5,Absolutely adorable!,This horseshoe cat is aweomse! I would like to buy more for my Christmas presents. Very well made and good value.
5,What a Gift This Book Is,"This amazing book begins with the author exploring with seven women and one man what the feminine consciousness is, why it's coming in now, what its role is and how it will help reshape our world. I can't tell if all eight of these people have reached enlightenment, but if not, they are well on their path, with each having their own spiritual journey and discipline. The book ends with those interviwed saying such similar things, concentrating on four areas: exploring the feminine consciousness, what's important about spiritual practices, the need to go beyond transcendence to transformation in everyday life (and in a balanced way), and finally where we're headed because of our bringing in the feminine consciousness and transformation. It is with heart-felt gratitude to the author for writing this book."
5,Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band Gorilla Album Review (I couldn't think of a better title! :(,"This is probably my dad's and my favorite album that we own simply for it's ridiculusness. Some background:The Bonzos were the ""house band"" for Monty Python's predicessor, a silly British tv show called ""Do Not Adjust Your Set."" Since they were that house band, you can't expect their music to be all that serious. If you listen closely to the lyrics, the songs are downright hilarious. I do not reccomend listening to this while doing homework, though. I just finished an essay that would've nomally taken me about one hour to write, revise, and edit, but instead it took me about 1.5 hours because I was listening to Gorilla. It's good for leisure time, but not for homework. In short, I love the Gorilla album."
5,AN ABSOLUTE 'MUST HAVE' FOR EVERYONE!!!!,"If you listen to this CD and you don't laugh out loud, Then JACK, YOU ARE DEAD!!! Better yet, just buy the entire collection on the 3 CD set called 'CORNOLOGY'."
5,Love it!,I recently ordered the Chamae Rose 2oz bottle and receivd it promptly.Item as described and I will absolutely purchase again!
2,Color is not expresso!,We ordered the expresso - but the color is quite different. The lighter shade is greenish grey! and the darker in almost black. Will do better in a black/grey scheme rather than expresso scheme. - So upsetting!
3,Where's the Great Big Sea?,"I saw the movie, and was stunned by the soundtrack, particularly by the fact that it had five songs by Newfoundland band Great Big Sea in it (Generally played in the cafe). I was extremely disappointed, therefore, to discover that none of these songs made it onto the CD, as they are both fabulous songs, and songs that were a crucial part of the overall mood of the movie."
4,The Shipping News,"I enjoyed the movie so much and loved the sound track, which I have really enjoyed and would recommend it to everyone who enjoys music with a Celtic sound."
2,Adds very little to the online docu,"This book adds very little to the online documentation provided by the tomcat team and seems to be published in a hurry just to be the first tomcat book in place. E.g. on p.103 at the end of chapter 5 you can read: ""In the next chapter, we cover securing a Web application using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)."" Well, there is no such chapter in the whole book. The same at the end of chapter 12, where Goodwill promises a Chapter on integrating the XML Apache Soap project into Tomcat. Again, no such Chapter.Covering the basics, the book does a good job, but as said, the provided ducumentation does it as well."
2,Falls far short of expectations.,"The author in the preface says that he expects this book to be a complete reference for Tomcat. I would say that it falls far short of the objective.I had expected a meaningful look at Tomcat. Most of the information presented is already available with the standard Tomcat distribution. There is no attempt to go beyond the surface. It seems the author was in a rush to get a book published, rather than spend time providing some insight into Tomcat.There is no proper introduction to the terms or concepts related to Tomcat. I don't expect an introduction to servlets or JSP. All I ask for is clear concise definitions of the various Tomcat components and a breakdown of the config files.If you are intrested in finding more about Tomcat stick to looking for the information online. It will be time well spent."
2,Save your money.,Talk about being disappointed! This book took a very superficial approach to some very basic concepts and the result is a book that might be useful if you are brand new to deploying servlet-based Web applications but useless if you want to learn about the nuts and bolts. I bought it to make sure that I'd know how to correctly configure Tomcat in a production environment but this book added very little to what I'd already learned from reading the documentation.
2,This book could have been something special...,"It's a shame this book was so poorly written, and misleading in its title. The Java/Tomcat community has been struggling for some time with Tomcat, trying desperately to gain some sort of useful insight from the horrid online documentation. Then along comes this long-awaited manual that could have easily saved the day for thousands of sysadmins.Problem is, this book provides next to no useful information on the integration of Apache and Tomcat. It's bad enough that this information comes at nearly the end of the book. What's worse, the integration chapter is only a few pages long, and goes no further (in fact, doesn't even go as far) as the documentation that's provided online.This book is a huge disappointment - you are far better served by picking up a good O'Reilly book on servlets/JSP/etc. and figuring out the Tomcat installation/webapp deployment issues on your own."
2,Good only for the beginners.,"This book is good only for the beginner. It scratches onlythe surface for most of the topics. At times, I thought itwas a work in progress, and for some reason, the author wasin a hurry to get the book published. The diagrams are awfulis many places. The total content of this book could be easilysqueezed into less than 70 pages.Most of the stuff explained here is easily available in theform of articles written for OnJava.com by the author himself."
1,forget it for linux,"The book seems to give a detatiled example of how to install on a windows platform, but who care's, I want to install it on Linux! There is no detail to get you off the ground."
2,Stick with the on-line docs,Does little more then scratch the surface in most areas.Would only be of any use for the novice.Ken
3,Somewhat helpful,The information is somewhat helpful. It is far from comprehensive and lacks in depth. It helped me get some basic tasks done but left a lot of questions unanswered. There is definitely a lot of room for a superior book on this subject to come along. I'd like to see such a book on Tomcat because I can't stand reading online documentation from start to finish. Online docs are only good for looking up particular info.
2,"this should be titled ""An introduction to Jakarta projects""","If you are new to JSP/servlet development or want to know more about Struct or Log4J, this might be what you need. But for those who wanted to get in depth detail on Tomcat, forget it."
3,"Not true to the title, but not totally worthless","I've been using Tomcat for about six months. I've been figuring it out little by little with the use of the online material which IMHO is lacking. I was hoping to get a good book to explain the information not easily learned through the product doucmentation.Instead of a Tomcat focused book, I got a decent JSP and Servlet overview, coverage of web site configuration, descriptions of different Tomcat features and then short chapters covering Apache Struts, Log4J, and SOAP.Not what I bargained for, but not a useless resource either."
4,Great Tomcat overview,"Just recently finished reading and studying the content of the book Apache Jakarta-Tomcat by James Goodwill. I have used Tomcat as a basic JSP engine for sometime now, but admittedly knew only the basics. Godwill in his book goes through how to setup the Tomcat server, as well as various different utilities and advanced configuration.As a result of reading this book, I now know how to use the Tomcat Manager, configure the tomcat security realms, and integrating Tomcat with Apache. In addition, was learned alot through the examples on struts and SOAP.All in all this book is great for someone looking to broaden their understanding of Tomcat."
1,Worthless,"I bought this book when it was first printed hoping for some insight into how Tomcat worked, design decisions, architecture etc. etc.What I got was nothing more than a rehash of the online documentation.A complete waste of money then and utterly worthless now. If you have a copy hang it on a nail."
2,Incomplete and not thourough,"This book is very, very superficial. Only a small part of the configuration of Tomcat is covered. Plus, it is certainly outdated today."
1,too expensive,The price for these 22 packets was several times more expensive than buying it in the 4 count package in a grocery store. The only reason I agreed to it was because the store had stopped carrying the item (but is now)
1,Cinematic satire is dead,"Tom Lehrer once said that political satire died the day Henry Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Thus it is with cinematic satire as this film won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. There is no story of any worth here. It adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition (which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies) per se, it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment. McKellan and Redgrave do their best, but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d'etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer. That it won an Oscar for the screenplay says far more about the Academy's often appalling decisions than anything else. Perhaps, like the American Presidency, lobby money can buy anything."
1,ridiculously overrated campy trash,"Only actor worth a hoot in this thing was B. Fraser -- McKellen and Redgrave's performances were pitiful. Redgrave acted like she was a skit character on SNL; I've seen McKellen's effeminate, snobby British character a zillion times. If you want to be bored out of your gourd, watch this claptrap."
5,Touching and Sincere,"Although I had some reservations about the movie, due to the whole Homosexual theme, I soon put aside all differences, and truly enjoyed the movie. It was extremily touching, and the ending was sad but sweet. I liked how Clay was able to put aside his somewhat unenjoyable relationship with James Whale, and remember him fondly for many years afterward.The issue that the movie deals with, has been something of a controversal subject for many years, and I enjoyed how Bill Condon was able to portray this problem senstively and emotionally. A terrific drama for not only Brendan Fraser fans, but also for those that only ever wanted to find love and acceptence."
4,Good movie but slim on the extras,"Without a doubt, those who appreciate fine, character-driven films will find much to like in Bill Condon's 1988 critically acclaimed biopic on legendary horror director James Whale. Ian McKellen delivers his finest performance to date as the charming, charismatic director whose best days are behind him along with Lynn Redgrave as the doting maid and Brendan Fraser as a young gardener who strikes up a quick and quirky friendship with Whale. The beauty of this film lies in its narrow scope with its very small palette of locations and supporting characters, giving the film a very intimate feel in the close confines of the three major players along with the subtlety of their interaction.On the disc itself all you'll get is a poorly transferred trailer and a ho-hum 30 minute featurette that offers little in the way of further value. Also disappointing is the lack of a proper Dolby 5.1 audio track - all you'll get on this shiny disc is a paltry 2.0 mono job."
4,Very good movie,"I finally watched this movie after having read many reviews on it and found it to be very good. I really loved learning about James Whale and his life, and having a look into his psyche. This movie has become one of my new favourites because of it's portrayal of a gay man's life not as simply a one-dimensional character, but as a whole person who just happened to be gay."
5,An intense and powerful Drama!,"I purchased this movie because I am a huge Brendan Fraser fan, but the movie is so moving that I somewhat forgot that Brendan was in it and became so captivated in the story, that I ended up watching it again a second time. It is wonderfully acted! I think it's Brendan's best work ever and Ian Mckellen is outstanding in this movie. For anyone looking for a movie that will move you and having you wanting friends and family to see it, this one will. It's such a powerful drama. One that I will watch over and over. I'm glad to have it in my Collection."
4,Good Movie,"Good movie, especially if you enjoy the old Universal horror movies. Knew little about ""Frankenstein"" director James Whale, but movie gives much insight."
3,DVD Letterboxing ruins a masterpiece,"Gods and Monsters is one of the perfect movies. The letterboxing, on DVD, however, absolutely ruins it. Many of the little things, ie. teacups, arm movements, etc, are gone, gone, gone. Watch it on VHS."
4,"Great ,but...","the nudity could have been left out! It have had the exact impact without. Redgrave was absolutely wonderful! Although I did not agreee with Ian McKellan's Oscar nod, his performance was mediocre compared to Jim Carrey's delightful performance in The Truman Show! The discrete nudity was the only downfall of this well made and written film."
2,Why?,"I often Buy having not seen a movie, especially when the reviews are glowing. Thankfully, I rented this first. I just don't see what was so special about this movie that was not family friendly, boring and drifted. My tastes go more for the movie that i can watch with my large family. This one doesn't qualify.Moreover, I don't see any of the usual devises that make you sit back and say, ""wow, well written"". I only rented this because of the academy award. I don't agree that it should have gotten the award over some of its worthy competitors.Rent it first as I did, maybe you'll agree with the professional reviews."
5,a poignant story about loneliness and friendship,"Every now and then comes a movie that reminds you that entertainment can also be an intelligent emotional experience. This poignant story of loneliness and friendship has everything to go for it. Ian Mckellen's performance is once again memorable and Brendon Fraser is at his best. Script, direction and dialogues are brilliantly handled by newcomer director Bill Condon. It should appeal to everyone because it is a movie about life and death, loneliness and friendship. The widescreen edition is remarkable."
5,"""Gods and Monsters,"" indeed!","What a surprising movie! First, you have one of the screen's great performances by Ian McKellen, and then there's the stunning revelation that Brendan Fraser has great depth and power as an actor and has been pretty much wasted in films up until now (except that he is terrific at comedy). This film on DVD is a marvel. The images are crisp and clean, the sound is clear and distinct, and the music score by Carter Burwell is one of the finest of recent years, subtly entwining itself into the psychological makeup of the characters and storyline. ""Gods and Monsters"" is a movie of rare depth and directorial eloquence. I cannot recommend it highly enough for thinking moviegoers."
4,Interesting DVD of an interesting film...,"The film is so interesting that the DVD capitalizes on the opportunity of further informing the viewer about the real facts behind the ""fact-tion"" story of director James Whale. Unfortunately the production of the special features seemed a bit rushed and ""unproduced,"" apparently (according to the director) much the same way as the film itself. Interesting insight into the world of indie film and leaves the audience wondering what glorious heights this one might have reached had the filmmakers had ample time and resources to recognize their vision. Nonetheless, it is a beautifully acted and packaged piece...well worth the time and attention!"
4,"Very good film, limited extras on DVD","The excellent performaces by McKellen, Redgrave and (surprise) Fraser, along with the insightful script and direction by Bill Condon make this one of the year's best films. It makes me want to discover Director James Whale's (whose story this is)works beyond FRANENSTIEN. I would love to see JOURNEY'S END (1930) or THE ROAD BACK (1937). Unnfortunatly the DVD ""special edition"" is a bit disappointing. The audio commentary by Bill Condon is good, however I do wish more members of the cast had been involved (particularly McKellen). The 30 minute documentary does not shed much light on Director James Whale's tormented life or work. The new FRANKENSTIEN DVD is much better in this regard. Other than a trailer, there are no other ""extras"" to mention. GODS and MONSTERS is certainly worth a rental, but think twice about purchasing this ""collector's edtion""."
3,i like this movie,i like this movie very much.... because the stars played well and i think it's the best scenario i ever seen.... thx
3,Sadly not so good,The Bottom Line:Everyone seems to love Gods and Monsters so I think it's my duty to inform you that it has an interesting first half but kinda flies off the handle in its hard-to-believe final act; the acting is fine and the concept interesting but the execution is rather spotty.2.5/4
3,A strange gay suicide,"It appear to be a movie about the last days of an historical English gay Hollywood film director.The acting is good, but the theme is just not what I like in a movie.He makes passes at a college student and his ex-marine gardener.Lynn Redgrave is very good as the maid/ cook character actor.The English seem, like the Catholic Priesthood, have a real problemwith homosexuality."
2,"I know I was supposed to be impressed, but....","This movie just didn't grab me, at any point. I am usually a tremendous fan of McKellan's work, and like Fraser's style. However, neither really clinched it in this film. The scene stealer in this blasé film has to be Redgrave, playing McKellan's Hungarian housekeeper. The film covers the recollections of the director of the original Frankenstein film. McKellen finds a confidante in Fraser, the yard/pool boy. While the recollections could have been riveting, somehow the delivery is flat, and you find yourself saying ""who cares?"" most of the time, without forming any affinity for either character's plight. Yes, McKellen is an openly gay actor, and yes, Fraser does a bit of a nude scene, but that's no reason to run out and buy this film. Rent it on a slow Saturday afternoon. It's watchable, but you won't want to re-watch it."
5,best screenplays have more stability,"One of the few recent films that I anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectations.Sir Ian McKellen once again performs well. The real surprise here is Brendan Fraser. Thanks to Bill Condon's amazing screenplay, Fraser is study of expressive and innocent contrast to McKellen's anguished and self-defeated character. Make a point to get this one. Best screenplays consist of strong dialogue, pacing, and narrative. The Oscars are usually accurrate about that."
5,Gods and Monsters,I thought I had already reviewed this product. I love this movieI hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
4,good,"I have to say the movie was much better then I expected it to be..I really enjoyed the ending and the meaning behind him befriending a ""strong type "" guy...get this movie..u wont be disappointed!!"
5,Fantastic Underrated film,"There is so much to love about this film it's hard to know where to begin. Ian MacKellan is brilliant as the director James Whale; Brandon Fraser is perfect as his ""monster"", and Lynn Redgrave is wonderful as his long-suffering maid Hanna. The three are the perfect ensemble and compliment each other perfectly.There are so many layers and dimensions to the story. Each time I watch it, I discover more to love about it. I heartily recommend this movie although not everyone will understand the deeper meaning. And it's definitely not for those who are homophobic, but those with an open mind will love it."
4,Kevin Bacon,"As usual, Kevin Bacon does a great job playing someone who is not such a nice guy yet he manages to give his character some humanity. You can tell he researched his character's profession.Brad Renfroe does a good job too and it's so sad that his life was cut short by his life choices. He was a promising actor.The story itself was entertaining enough. I didn't get the boy's attraction to Callista Flockhart's character. She plays it pretty drab inside and out."
5,Its a very gratifying film it befriends the audience at once,"This film is very sweet in sense that we get to know what Karchy goes through when he realizes America isnt necessary a place you can get away with telling lies when he meets his idol Billy Magic.Personally I would recommend this movie because it has great performances from Brad Renfro,Kevin Bacon and Calista Flockhart."
4,Great read!,"Once again, Jerome Doolittle is unafraid to take on issues that are controversial. Via Tom Bethany, the non working workaholic, he inserts some thought provoking insights into the heated debate of abortion. Perhaps the most frightening part is the antagonistic characters may be ousted from Jerome's book and placed into the world and we would be able to identify them. Jerome knows how to weave a story and fill it with humor, comraderie, and perhaps even a touch of wishful thinking."
4,Not bad at all,"I personally had no problems getting this game to run. I got it up and running within minutes, and was golfing soon after. I think this game is a joy to play. It gave me the impression of really being able to adjust my body position to hit the ball properly. To ready your swing, you have to set how your feet are positioned and how you angle the golf club, and I thought it was fun being able to do all those things to get the ball to curve just right onto the green, or at the right angle down the fairway. I haven't played many golf games out there, and this particular swing setup was new to me, but I enjoyed it. If you play golf leisurely like I do (but maybe golf video games more frequently), and like to learn about how your body affects your shot, I think you'll enjoy this game as I did."
1,POOR SUPPORT,"I purchased this game and it would not work. I contacted the manufacturer(Oxygen) and they asked to send them a diagnostc. I sent this information and never received a response(it has been one week). I contacted them at least ten times, I also called them and left a message without a reply.Subsequenty I learned from my computer manufacturer that this game requires a T & L accelerator card which is not included in laptops and the game will not work on laptop. This information could easily have been suplied by them instead of ignoring my request for support.I will never know if this game is any good or if it will work and I am stuck with it.Buyer Beware!In addition I would like to add that the phone support did eventually get back to me several days later and they tried to assist me but unfortunately the game is not designed for the current laptop but I never received a reply from the on line support"
4,Use this for a lifetime,"I have used this organizer for the last 4 years. I recommend it to any one who is interested in keeping track of finances, investments and goals. It deals with all aspects of personal finance including what your family should do in the event of your death. Perfect for anyone, young with no money and millionaires with dirty accountants."
1,don't bother,"As opposed to the listing and photo, this product has no provisions for headrests.There are no seatbelt slots. You can cut them in, but you can do that on a flat piece of cloth too. In fact this is actually not much more than a flat piece of cloth. Save the $$ and use an old blanket."
1,Disappointed,I should have listened to the first reviewer. It truly was nothing more than a blanket- with no provisions for seat belts or headrests. You could cut them in yourself but you can do that with a blanket and probably have a much easier time of it (cutting into this material and not having it fray would be near impossible). Can't believe it is being sold as a bench seat cover. I sent it back and got the Elegant brand instead from a local parts store. Elegant had the provisions for the seat belts and the head rests. So much happier with that purchase.
1,I did not receive the item,I did not receive this item. I filed the claim but I did not hear from the seller at all.
1,quite bad,"I did not like this book at all - the author promises to tell all the secret truth about Caruso (the stuff that has never been told before, you know...) - in the end he just tells what everybody already knew, only that he criticizes as much as he can - without any foundation just to reveal the promissed secret. If you're looking for a good book about Caruso take ""My father and my family"" in the unabridged version by Caruso jr. (the best ever written about Caruso) or the book by Michael Scott."
1,HORRIBLE,"I would acttualy give it 0 stars. This book accuses the ming and Qing Emperors as horrible rulers and doesnt mention much about the manchus. it also criticies to much about the Qing Dynasty. Also, the information is OUTDATED/ along woith many words. DO NOT BUY THIS BOKK! DONNT EVEN LOOK AT IT!"
5,Excellent Reference Library Text for a PLS,This book is simply excellent. It covers surveying subjects thoroughly and with great technical depth. It taught me to calculate state plane coordinate conversions by hand so that I understand what happens in a computer.This is the type of text that will elevate the PLS profession.
3,It's time for a change!!,"Crystal Phillips' story of her journey to a new life is very inspiring. After her brother's tragic death and the abuse from her husband, Crystal had hit rock bottom, weighing almost 300 pounds due to all of the emotional baggage that she carried around inside of her heart. Eating was her emotional release when she was faced with problems that she could not handle. Finally, Crystal decided that she just could not continue to live her life this way, after a friend had invited her to church one New Year's Eve. From that day forward, she was determined to live a healthier life, gain her self-esteem back, and be the woman she knew she could be!! 'The Me I Knew I Could Be' is filled with workout plans, healthy recipes, and tips to start you on your way to living a better, healthier, fullfilling life!LatashaVice President of B~more Readers with W.I.S.D.O.M Book ClubBaltimore, Marylandb_morereaderswithwisdom@yahoo.comwww.myspace.com/bmorereaderswithwisdom"
4,"It is excellent. Beautiful songs, well sung",I have always loved the music of Eric Coates. This CD offers a fine interpretation of his music. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes the Old-English Song. I will broadcast this on Melbourne Radio - GW
4,Good Book,"Being a student, and advocate of ""the Dating Game/seduction/pick up community"", let me say thatwhile initially i saw some overlap of some of the material taughtby David D. and others, Corey has done his homework, and isdelivering a good value to men. I learned some new ways to communicatewith women by reading this book. I think to get everything outof it, you will have to reread it a couple of times, but if you'rea guy who has no game, even though the price is a bit steep, (in reality it's essentially an ebook in print)(i.e. average price of a dating ebook is $39.99) it is spot on, and you will get your money's worth!"
5,excellent readable fun,"Martin Deporres Kennedy has a fine gift for storytelling. He pulls you into the story. I read this through in one sitting. The story is a vehicle for introducing theological ideas, often through debates between characters. These debates are very realistic, and may reflect actual arguments that the author haard or participated in. I would strongly recommend this for students. It would be a wonderful thing for Catholic high school religion teachers to assign their class."
4,Still The Best,"Originally published in 1974, Creamer's book was the first ""serious"" biography of Ruth and remains the standard work on the subject. The first few chapters are a bit slow as the author painstakingly chips away at decades of apocrypha and rumor to reconcile the many conflicting accounts of the Babe's youth. The pace picks up once Ruth reaches the big leagues and really takes off after he's sold to the Yankees. Creamer is frank about the Babe's ravenous appetites and the effect these had on those around him, notably his first wife. Ultimately, Ruth comes off as a jovial, well-meaning but rather selfish man who was fun to be around but not someone you'd want to depend on.This Kindle edition has a hyperlinked table of contents and index but contains no photographs save the cover."
5,The Sultan of Swat,"This is a complete and thorough examination of the life and playing career of a baseball icon. The author has done a commendable job of separating the facts from the fanciful fictions that have grown up surrounding George Herman Ruth. While his home run record has been surpassed, I still think one can argue that Ruth was the greatest baseball player when one considers that in addition to his hitting abilities Ruth was an outstanding pitcher. He was shifted to the outfield when his managers determined that he could be of greater value as an everyday player rather than pitching every third or fourth day."
4,Still the Sultan,"I really enjoyed this book. It gave me a behind the scenes look at the greatest baseball player of all time. Not only did I enjoy the baseball stories, but I also found the stories about the unique personality of ths man very amusing."
3,"Entertaining read, ended too quickly...","This book started out really well, and kept my attention throughout, however- Ms. Glass seems to have rushed the ending. The story develops the characters well, and is believable and entertaining. I just thought the climax was rushed. Everything happens in the last chapter, and it just seemed like she wanted to finish the book without finishing the story. I would recommend this book for an easy read."
2,Not the best I have,"I am a little disappointed in the quality of the stainless on this product. I have an older 1 oz. version of this and it is really nice. The stainless looks like it is about to get rusty at any time if I don't dry it immediately and thoroughly after every use. Compared to my little one, the shine factor is just not even there. I regret not buying one of these about 15 years ago when I got my small one."
1,very poor quality,"This item is on sale, for a reason. It is not any better than the original one that came with the speaker. Very thin wires. Very dissapointing. I had to go to best buy and spend $35 to get some better wires."
5,This film is only for laser printers,"For those considering this overhead transperency film, only order it for use with laser printers or laser copy machines. It is not intended for inkjets and needs the laser fuser to ""burn in"" the image. It works great with the correct printer/copy machine."
3,doesn't work in inkjet printer,"This paper won't work in an ink jet printer, which is not surprising since it says on a box ""Transparency Film for Copiers"". For this price I will not return it but use as ""write-ons."""
5,This will make your install a breeze. . .,My car is a 1994 Honda Civic EX. Save yourself a headache and get this if you have to replace your stereo. Plug and play.
3,nice collectors item,"LIVING IN FT LAUDERDALE with all age groups, this concert or footage makes it on the screen from time to time and the viewer's look at it in aw,..wondering where they could buy the tape. a very good performance..!"
4,The comedy fighter anime,"I must admit I bought this anime for my girlfriend, she is just getting into anime and picked it out at random, so it was a very random not really thought about purchase. But I am still plesantly surprised by this purchase. Funny and action work well together in this anime. All the people in the anime are ones you want to learn about. Especially Kenichi himself. Can't wait to check out the rest of the show and hopefully if it ends well I'll be picking up the next season."
2,Great Beginning--Disappointing in Total,"I loved the first chapter of ""Surrender.."" and then the author killed off the most interesting character... But even worse, there are huge psychological flaws here... Flat characters.. Unrealistic portrait of a mother's grief .. and an ending that is so out of touch with the mother's reality.. It's just too light and doesn't , as so many books seem not to, deliver on its initial promise... Yet, on the positive side, the scenes are vivid, memorable and ditto some of the characters.. But that beginning was SO promising.. that the rest drops you into sadness.. not about the death portrayed but about the value of a great story that doesn't begin to meet its promise."
2,Surrender this one,"After plodding through a few chapters of these boring characters, I surrendered the book to the stack waiting to go back to the library."
4,The story takes off AFTER the central character dies...,"Meg Wolitzer accomplishes something astonishing here. She creates a compelling character in Sara Swerdlow even after her sudden death at the end of the first chapter. Surrender, Dorothy is, I think, about how each of us is the sum of our impact on others in our lives - and their collective perceptions of us. I eased through the story, as sad as it frequently is, quickly, and Wolitzer's style is similar to that of some of my favorite authors: Elinor Lipman, Anne Tyler and Stephen McCauley."
1,"Boring,Boring,Boring,,,","How an author can create such great characters while writing a novel free from compelling circumstances is surprising. Ho hum, I can't believe she's dead, let's pour ourself another drink. I can't believe her mother showed up, ho-hum let's pour another drink and watch her clean the house. One big secret does surface, but it is rather mundane in it's telling. At the end everyone gets better, while the Mom who is easily the most exciting of the group, realizes life does go on after the loss of a child. Even if'ts is a miserable and shallow existence. Color this whole novel as grey and bland as a grief stricken day in the Hamptons. I was disappointed because I really looked forward to this book, and intead could barely muster the energy to finish it."
1,"If I could rate it 0 stars, I would have!","I looked forward to reading yet another Meg Wolitzer novel, and I was very disappointed--in fact, I lost interest early on and never finished it. Some of the author's earlier works, such as Sleepwalking and Hidden Pictures, were excellent--what happened???"
3,Ready to impress,"3 1/2Although over-composed, the album continues a diverse musical assertion from an almost unclassifiable World-fusion Jazz artist technical-minded enthusiasts should embrace."
3,Great Story Line,"What a great story line. The book is a bit choppy to follow, but I was pleased none the less."
1,Would not buy were I you,"The book's horrendous, a waste of money. I could have focused on other books, but sadly, did not. The worst book I have ever read, with poor characters, poor writing. I did not like at all. Was there even an editor? If you desperately want to give it a try, borrow somewhere (not that you'll find it in the library).... just don't buy it!"
1,Disappointed,I read this book and hoped against hope for something new in vampire lore but it's basically the same old stuff not very interestingly written.
2,Left me cold,"Okay, I'll admit it was sort of scary, but it got on my nerves how completely unlikeable the characters were. When one of the humans fell prey, I thought 'so what'...when one of the vampires was being high and mighty, I thought 'whatever'. Having the vampires turn into a grotesque, ugly beast is orginal, but actually rather distasteful. It did have a lot of surprise twists to the plot, which saved it from being awful, but I won't read it again, and I won't keep the book. My biggest complaint is that no one could resist the draw of vampirism...what absolutely no one? Come on."
3,kodak photograhic filters handbook,"This book is designed for professional photographers, photo lab technicians and scientists who use filters. The book contains infomation on applications, physical, optical and transmission characteristics. This book is not suitable for amateur photographers wanting to learn about the use of filters to improve their photography. Contains no pictures, its all numbers and graphs."
2,Not as well-made as I'd hoped,"The three bears on this toy spin easily, which makes it great for a young baby to play with. Each of the bears are rattles and are not only interesting to watch but noisy too. However, the suction cup doesn't work very well, even when moistened. I used to put it on our baby's swing tray, and then her high chair tray, but it never stuck for long and would fall over. Obviously it's quite top-heavy, so it's not a toy that is made to be HELD and played with.Occasionally I will still try it on her high chair tray but now she's strong enough that (because it doesn't stick well) she can knock it to the floor. Mostly it just sits in her toy box and doesn't get any play.My recommendation? If you're looking for a suction cup toy, try something else. Overall, this one just isn't worth it."
1,Not up to expectations.,"I thought the author would actually REVIEW the outlet malls, not just tell us where they are (you can get that for free on the Internet!) He warns that not all ""outlets"" really offer great bargains -- but you have to check 'em all out yourself to find out which ones do.And guess what -- he says you can get great prices at Sams, KB Toys, and Tuesday Morning. Well, ""duh""."
5,What a gorgeous watch!!! (for $65),"I have been looking for a new dress watch for a month. (I am kind of a fussy person). I saw this watch and read the reviews . It made me considered about buying it. I decided to buy this one. I've got it today. I thought of two words on my mind. (everytime when I bought stuff online) ""Satisfied"" or ""Disappointed"". After I opened the package. I smiled all day long.Nice watch!!! Good price.!A few things want to mention you all, The watch is a little bit smaller than I expected (But it's not a promblem because my wrist it's so small(6"").it fits me perfectly)Don't be panic about the watch doesn't work at the first time. You have to let it charges for a while.(Good function,though! you don't need to worry about changing baterries)I love the lobster claw-clasp because I can adjust it myself. (I always got a problem about paying extra for adjusting the band)Well..I'd recommend this watch to anybody. Buy for yourself or as a gift. You will be happy anyway.Love it!!"
5,"great price, perfect product","I have a tendency to burn out watch batteries, so this watch is perfect for me. No more replacing batteries every 3 to 6 months. Plus as a woman with a larger wrist I have a terrible time finding a feminine looking watch that fits me. This one I have plenty of room and it looks great."
3,a watch for a girlie-girl... so pretty!!,"this is a great watch, looks so elegant and beautiful, & it's solar powered so it's great for the enviroment.... the only thing is... you have to charge it each and everytime you go out or it stops running!!!"
4,1st Impression,"This was the first time I ever bought something off the store online, I wasn't expecting it to come in on time, much or less receive it cause of all the scandaling now a days. Very impressed and can't wait to buy more online"
4,Mosby's Medical Dictionary,"This dictionary has come in handy for doing homework in my Pathophysiology class. Reasonable price since it has covered some topics that were not in my textbook, lectures, or searching online."
5,5 to the 10th Power In Stars,"They should really raise the star point system here, because anything by Mosby is worth the buy. I have the Mosby's Medical Dictionary for Nursing and Allied Health Professionals, and when I saw this book in the store, I was trying to figure out the difference, because of the color. This one offers just as many details as my previous book. This is important, because it is an easy read, and it is necessary for each household to have, for children to study off of, to the housewife that just wants to be informed. Mosby has been following me through nursing school, and anything they sell as a study aide will have a place in my home."
1,Much Is Missing,"This particular Dictionary does not come with conversion tables, or any of the other information that is advertised with this purchase. All it came with was the Atlas of Anatomy and the word definitions. So very upset with this purchase."
5,A hidden diamond,"It is interesting listening to this album. Even though many of the songs date back 35 years and all of them are over 20 years old this album is like ABBA -it hasn't dated with time. Sure some of the songs have that 1970's feel, but many of them don't. The opening song has uses Thamas Arne's Rule Brittania tune. But the ""How do you do"" song is the classic, a song that even today sounds fresh.Sadly Mouth is now dead, (December 2004 of a heart attack.) and maybe that adds something to this album too.But the real star of this Album is Maggie MacNeal. Her music is as fresh and beautiful and up to date now as when it was first released 30 years ago. ""When your lady says Goodbye"" is a real classic of pigant musical beauty. One of the greatest tragedies of this album is that Maggie MacNeal has been all but forgotten today. Neither she nor her music deserve to be forgotten..."
1,I finally found it,"My search is over. I have finally found the absolute worst record in the history of recorded sound. These guys are so awful they make the Dead sound like the Vienna Boys Choir. The stuff on this record cannot even be called music. They must have been great at PR, because they had absolutely no ability to make recorded sound at all. I heard that one of them is dead. Good. One down, one to go."
2,One of the most disappointing Heinlein books,"This book seemed like just another rehash of the basic training storyline from Starship Troopers. But there's less to it than in Starship Troopers. I don't like the characters. The only one that says anything other than the ""gee shucks, we're in the space patrol"" line is an utter creep and many of the scenes just drag along. I heard that kids have liked this book and it seems more written for teenagers than adults, but there's not a lot to recommend. Only in the last 30 pages does the book pick up and start doing things, but up until then it's training, training and more training.For better Heinlein books of this style try either Starship Troopers or Podkyne of Mars."
5,Provides valuable lessons -- especially for adults!,"I am a faculty member at a law school. When we considered revamping our curriculum, I gave the committee members passages from this book to read, where the Academy's approach is made clear. Universally, the response was: ""Yeah, that's how we should do things. But we have to pursue a feel-good approach now."" Heinlein understands that character matters, and that institutions should encourage responsibility, not undermine it. That, I suppose, is why he was never an administrator.... Nonetheless, this is not only a terrific story, but one -- like all of Heinlein's juniors -- with a point."
3,A great introduction to sci-fi for younger readers.,"Hard to rate this book. Do I judge it as an adult ( ok book but nothing earth shaking..) or as the young boy I was when first I read it? The boy who read it was enchanted by characters that he identified with and a story that zoomed with adventure. As an adult it is still a tresured part of my collection. A great place for the younger set to be introduced to the wonderful world of science fiction. Plus... unlike some of Heinlein's books, which are geared most decidedly towards a more mature audience, this is a book that I could give to my 8 year old cousin without worrying about what he'll find inside. As a kids book this rates from a 6.5-8 out of 10"
5,Book that turned me on to science fiction,"I first read this book in 1970, a time that seems so long ago now it's hard to remember just what it was like. I happened upon it on my school library shelves, among the ""H"" books, among five other Heinleins. I read all of them, but this one was still the one that impressed me the most. Even though it's been nearly fifty years after its first publication, even though things didn't work out like Heinlein proposed, I can still recommend this as a good book to jump-start someone's interest in science fiction."
4,Good purchase,Shipping was quick and the condition of this used paperback book was as described. I was completely satisfied with this purchase.
4,One of Heinlein's better Children's Stories,"This book is an excellent adventure in the Heinlein series. He once again creates a captivating set of charecters that drwas the auidence in. The story is set in space, as the main charecter is attempting to become a part of the elite space patrol. It is a story about duty, honor, and becoming a man with responsibility"
4,A monologue on shortfalls of general-ship and the war of 1914-18,"JFC Fuller has always been erudite and his reaction to the general-ship in World War I makes an excellent read.I however do wish that the digitisation had been better since each page needs a change of font size in this Kindle edition, when read on an I pad."
3,A good place to start a discussion...,"This is a good way to start a discussion with your middle-school-aged child, but it is definitely dated. With a publishing date of 1992, keep in mind that a great deal of legislation has happened concerning abortion in the past 12 years which is not reflected in this book. Still, it is a useful tool for someone looking to talk about 1. abortion issues, 2. the way our legislators' votes can directly affect our lives, and 3. one's religious beliefs or lack thereof. I'll keep it on my homeschool bookshelf for a reference book."
1,OOPS!,"I know it says outdoor but I thought since the fire was caged... Let's just say I strongly recommend you do not use this inside. Your insurance WILL NOT cover any related incident!Oh, the humanity!"
2,Mediocrity for our times,The author uses Enron as an example of what can happen if his strategies are implemented. Need I say more?
5,Beautiful Ring!,This is a gorgeous ring. I love the unique design and how it sparkles and shines. I've received some very nice compliments too.
1,Horrible,"I own the Swissmar Borner V Slicer and find it to be of exceptional quality (very sharp and useful). This item, however, is not. Maybe if you are using this tool to make interesting Veg'Art, but I found it wouldn't even peel a potato properly. The peeler part is so dull I'm not sure what anyone would do with that feature. The rest of the tool is plastic. I wish I never purchased this since it is not worth paying to send the item back."
2,Almost awful product from Borner!,"I have the Borner mandolin and other Borner graters which are very well designed, but this one is a total failure. The grater is almost dull, made of very thin metal that bended while sitting in the drawer. The metal blade also fell once, but I managed to insert it back. The handle is uncomfortable due to it sharp shapes. I gave the stars for the other uses, as I successfully managed to open an orange with it. It might also work for other tasks, but not for grating.I can't believe Borner was able to produce such a bad tool. I am not recommending it, as there are many other better graters on the market!"
1,Not Vermont American,"You may think you are buying Vermont American quality, but what you will receive is the brand ""Do It Best"" crap FROM CHINA. Junk don't buy."
2,Material too flimsy,"I bought this bed recently for my 9 year old lab mix. He doesn't dig, chew or abuse things in any way, so I wasn't concerned with getting a super abuse-proof bed. But after a couple of weeks of limited use I found a hole in the soft side of the bed. The fact that this side attracts hair is unfortunate, but a hole being made almost immediately makes this bed not worth buying. It may have been a decent design if it was made with sturdy materials. Very disappointing."
2,Too noisy!,"The combination of the cedar and the nylon made this bed incredibly noisy. I had to pick my dog and put her on it, and once she got off of it, she wouldn't go back on. She looked at me like she was being tortured being on it. She did sleep on it for one night but wouldn't go back on it at all. Not exactly the dog bed I had in mind."
5,Good Product,The quality was more than I expected for the price. Bought this for work and it's perfect for the food biz.
2,"Great group, poor dvd",Dvd was dissapointing. It was not a 2007 concert as you could be lead to believe on the way the dvd is advertised.The dvd was released in 2007 but was of a 1982 concert. Parts of the sound track are not in sinc with the video.
2,crosby stlls and nash live in LA 2007,DVD is not a 2007 concert but one in the 1980's.Title is misleading. Sound is also out of sync on some songs. Dissapointng.Live in L.a.
1,Santana - Live by Request,"War Of The Worlds will about blow my windows out. I have the newest and greatest Home theater systems with 15"" speakers. This DVD is flat. Sounds like a mono system from the 50s"
2,Nothing New!! Same as SuperNatural but......,Only Michelle Branch save this album!!!!All guys play along with unenthusiastic beat!!! even Karl
3,Buyer Beware,"Picture sharp and a 4:3 aspect ratio but recorded in stereo,no dolby digital 5:1 or DTS 5:1"
3,Nice ... but.,"What can I say? It's Carlos! With a great band too. I guess I wanted a some more old-time, but-kicken from Dennis Chambers, but that's just me. It's a nice concert if you like the newer stuff (with guest singers) mixed with a few of his standards. Nicely priced too, for a very high quality DVD production."
5,My first vegetarian cookbook,"A friend gave me this book (the spiral edition) in 1973, and it truly changed my life -- I became a vegetarian immediately. This is where I learned how to cook and eat all kinds of food that I'd never seen before, especially beans. I am not crazy about the ""breakfast"" recipes, but the breads in this cookbook are great. I have over a hundred cookbooks, and I still make the lasagne with adzuki beans (complicated) and the potato soup (easy). Almost every page in my book is either stained or annotated or both.The only disadvantage to this cookbook is that many recipes call for dairy products and eggs -- things that I still enjoy after 29 years, but that I am not allowed to eat as often these days!This is a classic, educational cookbook for vegetarians."
3,Not for lactose intolerant,"RECIPES FOR A SMALL PLANETI was disappointed to find that a great deal of the complimentary protein in the recipes relied on dairy products, especially a great deal of powdered milk. If you are able to digest milk products, then this might be a useful book."
3,Recepies for a small planet,"Product arrivede as promised. Slightly more used than I expected, but still satisfied with product"
2,Nearly Useless,"I've owned this cookbook for years. A well-meaning relative gave it to me when I first became a vegetarian 16 years ago, and it's a good thing that I didn't start to try recipes from this book early on, because I would have given up on vegetarianism. There are some decent bread recipes here, but the remainder are almost uniformly terrible. Nutritious, perhaps, but also tasteless without a seeming thought to presentation or texture. This book represents the worst of early vegetarian cooking in America, and I have yet to prepare a single recipe from this book that I found to be truly appetizing, or that I would (heaven forbid) serve to guests. I didn't sell my copy because I wouldn't inflict this sort of thing on an unsuspecting victim - I recycled my copy."
5,Not Just For Kids!,"This product is not just for kids, but very good for adult drivers who do not ordinarily have passengers in the car. I put all my ""junk"" in it which used to be jumbled on the seat beside me. When I am going to have someone else in the car, I just pull it out and put it in the back seat. So much nicer than tossing stuff from the front to the back to make room for a passenger! It looks so neat and holds everything I need."
4,They didn't live happily every after,"Faith Wish is a great book that mature teenaged girls can relate to. AnneMarie, a beautiful, 17-year-old underachiever, has been put on an academic contract and will not graduate with her high-school class - to her dismay. When she attends a tabernacle meeting led by Brother Jackson, a charismatic, handsome self-proclaimed minister, she becomes a true Christian. After discovering she is pregnant with Brother Jackson's child, she turns to him for help, and he takes her to a spiritual redemption camp to find guidance. There, she sheds her old skin and past sins, including sex, drugs, and smoking. Unfortunately, all does not end well, as she struggles to find answers to her dilemna."
2,Not good,"If I hadn't promised to review this book for our school library, I would have stopped reading after the first chapter. This book is not well written, nor are the characters or subplots believable. I can't think of a single student I have ever had who I would recommend this book to. Very disappointing."
5,Great card for peripherals,"I've been using this card regularly since 2003 in different PC laptops. I got it as a gift with my 1st iPod and have used it for countless hard drives, including for audio recording purposes. Audio & video people take note this has the sought-after TI chipset. All in all it's been rock solid. My only concern now is whether it works under Windows 7."
4,"A warning, however, regarding IPods","I bought this to use with an Apple IPod. It is a great card and works well for the most part, but it does NOT work with my IPod. Even though it is recommended by Apple (...), it can't supply (enough?) power and the IPod's battery drains in seconds."
4,nice,Its great information made me just want to read more it showed me how i can achieve things on mind and spirit in this religion amazing!
4,Packed full of information & variety,"With great production quality and packed full of instruction, education, and entertainment, Aradia's DVD is a valuable addition to a belly dancer's collection. Very useful tips of the similarities and differences in Middle Eastern dance styles and clear, pleasant instruction. Includes warm-up, instruction, beautiful performance clips from various shows, and full performances in different costumes. Great music by DJZen & John Bilezikjian."
4,"So simple, yet so fun","We went to a pool with a dear friend. She shared this with my son. Little did she know that this curious toy would be such a hit. My son loved it. I had to go buy two for us -- one for him and one to share, so he could have water wars. We took them to a lagoon with some friends and the kids all took to it right away.It's a water canon, a bullhorn, a funnel, and even a strange device that the kids rigged up to pull a body board around. This is durable, with a lot of play value for toddlers up to teens. Well, if you want it played with as intended (pull cone down large side first and water flies out the other end), they'd have to be at least 6 years old -- younger kids have problems doing it. The water can shoot quite high, if they do it right. But even if they can't make it shoot, the kids will figure out something to do with it."
2,Put holes in our pool liner,"We loved this toy at first . . .great fun! But when my son decided to put his foot in it and bounce around the pool, he put 7 holes in our pool liner before we discovered the problem. Never thought that would happen and this fun toy promptly went in the trash!"
3,"Time to look up ""Modern""","In reference to LadyNaava's complaint that this volume doesn't actually contain current or recent slang. I fear that's impossible. At least for a bound reference. In the time it takes to print a book, let alone compile a dictionary, current slang changes, changes back, disappears and is replaced.That said, the warning that this volume may not be up to date with many of the better ""regular"" dictionaries (which have recently added Homer's D'oh! after only twenty years) is appreciated."
3,3rd Rock From the Sun Tunes Recorded in a '65 Rambler,This music is really fun. It is such a guy CD. Imagine an artist creating music about his car and then turn his car into a recording studio so that he can record these songs in his car. All this with the dream of hearing these songs be played over said car's radio as he drives thru Santa Monica! That is what Ben Vaughn did. He brings back a lot of memories for teens in the 70's who had quite a love affair with their cars. Play it loud in your convertible as you drive down Pacific Coast Highway.
5,we are witnesses,"We are witnesses by Jacob Boas, is a GREAT book to read it gives you different views of teenagers that went through diffuculty during the holocaust. As you know, the person who was in charge of the holocaust was Hitler. All the teeangers talked about hope they always had the hope to live and to have their own family. They never talked about hate, they never said they hate hitler the only thing that they said was that he was responsible for what was happening. This was shocking to me because I would hate the person who had my family killed. Wouldn't you?"
2,I don't like it,IT WAS SOOOOO BORING. no action at all. I had to read it for a school project on the holocaust and I ended up changing my book. I personally thought it wasn't good.
2,We Are Witnesses,"When I picked up this book and thought I would be reading experts from the dairies of David, Yitzhak, Moshe, Eva, and Anne but I was wrong. I belive that the book had to many narriations and really didn't see it through the eyes of the teenagers. The book was informative but it lacked the feeling of the Holocaust. The book did tell of the deaths of the teenagers but it did't bring out the feelings that I expected. Over all it was an so so book."
3,it was alright,"this book was extremly sad, howerver my attention was not totally captured. the people who wrote these diaries did not seem to know what was going on outside there ghettos, so did not give information about that. It did however say how teens must have felt."
2,Ok I guess,"This book was OK. I had to read it for school but I agree that it had way too many narrations in it and the only thing that captured the teens' feelings and thoughts were the scant entries from their diaries. This book didn't move me at all. If the author had put more of the kids' entries in it, it might be more effective."
5,Caught the fever!,"I was introduced to this band by some friends. Not only are their covers better than some of the original recordings but Brian's love songs are amazing. Give a listen this cd, specifically I'm Gonna Stay and the title track, The Great Symphony."
3,Textbook - What can I say?,It is what it is - a textbook that I had to have for a course I am taking. Not for light reading!!
4,Yea for resold books,Book came quickly and was in acceptable condition. I couldn't make it with all my textbooks if it wasn't for resale of them. Thank You!
3,Initiating discussion,"While Sullivan has some limitations, he does provide a broad paradigmatic presentation of social problems in the U.S. Even though many chapters cover topics in an abbreviated fashion, this text is a good tool for starting discussions on social problems. Given this arrangement, instructors can construct discussions either enhancing the material or taking a counter perspective."
1,A look at a distant past,"I found it interesting. It will be used in an adult ed. class. I will have a better idea of its uses after the class meets and discusses the poems, how it reflects the times and how comfortable gabirol was in Medieval Spain"
5,Inspiration & Motivation,"Right into the book one of the authors (Norean) talks about the necessity of getting out of our own way in the battle to lose weight. She had my attention from that moment on. Most of us know how to lose weight, it's our attitudes that need adjusting. This book is easy to read, with helpful information on every page. I read it with a Magic Marker in my hand, marking passages to read again. It was pretty well marked up by the time I finished the book. AND, it's got to be the FIRST weight loss book I've ever read cover to cover. I highly recommend it. It's written with compassion."
4,Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Finally a book that is written in every day language that nonprofessional people can understand. After struggling with my weight for about 10 years now, it was refreshing to read a book that MAKES SENSE! While some of the excercises are not easy, just keep with it and you too will begin to understand why you over-eat. I am not saying that I agree with all of the Wilbert's reason, but they made me look deep inside myself. (And you know, it is much easier to pass by those cookies that they have at business meetings because I now believe in me. I can do it, I can overcome.) I have combined the book with a comercial lifesytle and use elements of each to help me loose weight. I am truley grateful for the Wilbert's for writing this book."
5,The Heart of the Matter,"This book goes right to the heart of the matter - answering the question so often asked: Why do so many fail at weight loss when they know what to do? The narrative is authentic, ringing true from personal experience and case histories. Developing a new way of thinking is challenging and these authors, while providing encouragement, are realistic about the difficult road one must travel to change thought patterns. I found it very valuable."
5,AWESOME MOVIE A MUST SEE,I Loved this Movie Plain And Simple It is A MUST SEE. Zoey Saldana has a huge impact in this film. I have multiple copies of this film in my home some how lol but it is well worth it. A must see buy it. Pop some popcorn and enjoy :)
2,"Good beginning, bad ending","This book's first chapter was good. It explained the complete history of Airedales. However, past page 32, they did not even mention ""Airedale"" (it was only written in the captions). There were Airedale pictures throughout, but they ended in the middle of the book. The rest seemed like an advertisement for Nylabone. In conclusion, if you are looking for a breed specific book about Airedales, I would not suggest buying this book."
3,"Good, affordable, but very small print","This Bible is a good value and it's compact; however, just know that the print is very small."
1,Poor quality.,"I bought 4 of these Bibles (same ISBN) at a local Christian bookstore. They have the imitation leather cover. All of the covers have come unbound from the pages. Very poor quality. I love the NASB, but this is just poorly made."
4,Not all war movies have to be action adventure films,"I have watched ""The Man Who Never Was"" several times over the years.This movie is a dramatization of a real-life intelligence action - ""Operation Mincemeat""There really was a Major William Martin, sort of. As portrayed in the film this name was fictitious, but there really was a person whose body was used in an operation like the one depicted.This film is not for the action/adventure movie buff. There are no explosions, there is no gunplay, no chase scenes...well, sort of.The movie is actually a very reverent telling of an important extremely successful operation. You will like this if you enjoy military history and espionage.4 stars - a solid film worth seeing."
4,Tales of British wartime Derring-Do!,"It IS a true tale and a lot of the detail is correct - till about half way through when an ""Irish spy"" arrives in the UK on behalf of the Germans. Not needed in the real world story - the twist is needed to add some tension at the end of the film.Clifton Webb acts like Clifton Webb - that is to say like a plank of wood! However for the period it is well done.Spot the pennant number on a Castle Class frigate in the background of one scene and then go and watch ""The Cruel Sea"". Guess the Admiralty ""lent"" the British cinema the same ship in more than one movie!Topical (early 2008) because as of late the identiy of the ""body"" used in the real war has become subject of fresh debate."
3,WWII Intrigue,"A pleasant, predictable movie. If you like WWII spy type movies, you will enjoy this one. Not much action and the acting is a bit on the bland side, but still fun to watch."
2,"I'm glad the man never was, I wish the movie never was either!","Adopting the story of operation ""Mincemeat"" from World War II, this movie shows the details of a very successful mission to deceive the Axis alliance.Though an intriguing story, the performance seemed cold and boring. It just made me think that a great story has been ruined."
2,Dull as Lead,"Thirty minutes into the film, viewing it in w/s, I ejected the disc. I thought the characters were two-dimensional. I thought the script was hackneyed. I thought the direction was plodding. ""Dam Busters"" held my interest. ""The Man Who Never Was"" did not."
4,"Fantastic, because it based on a unbelieveable true story","If this was a fictional story it still would be a good story.The plot seems proposterous and not within the relm of reallity, but it actually worked and is credited with saving thousands of lives both American and British. Patton and Montgomery would have had a much harder time taking Sicily if not for this brillient piece of espinoage. No vulgar language, no gore, just a good movie to watch. Well worth your time."
4,Cheers for The Man Who Never Was,"I had always tought of clifton Webb as that weird guy who starred only in The Stars And Stripes For Ever, A 1950's verson of The Titanic and Cheaper By The Dozen. He comes a accross as a brilliant ex attorney, an Hercules Poirot type almost, trying to think one step ahead of the Gerries in this wonderful espionage thriller.True there are no big battle scenes but how all the pieces come together and the tension that builds when the German spy comes to check on things was masterful. Everything fits.I had read the book on this tale at 15 and now at 42 have seen the film for the first time and give it 4 + stars."
4,What a surprise,"I loved this movie. It is a true story told honestly. It holds you in suspense like any good thriller. Of course it is dated, but that adds to its quality. Also, it was in color and I feel that helped. Very few people know that a corpse played a very important part in WWII when it was used as a decoy by the British to fool the Germans that they planned an invasion in a different place to where it did happen. The Germans were not fools, and they sent an Irish agent to check out the corpse story. That was where it got really exciting. For its age and subject matter, the movie was quite impressive. Also the dvd has excellent quality color and sound. It survived surprisingly well over the years. You won't be disappointed if you like WWII movies."
4,An exciting World War II movie,"I rate ""The Man Who Never Was"" as an excellent and exciting World War II movie. Why can't movies be made like this anymore? Recent World War II movies are not accurate and place too much emphasis on effects. In my opinion, the more ""special effects"" a movie has, the more fake it is. Anyhow, ""The Man Who Never Was"" describes the true events of the British trying to confuse the Germans as to where the Allies will invade - Sicily or Greece. By arranging to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain with top-secret documents, the British cause the Germans to alter their defenses, thus saving the Allies from suffering even more casualties. How the British found a body, the details that they had to come up with to make the Germans believe the body was for real, and the subsequent German effort to determine whether or not the information found on the body was accurate, all make for an exciting story which moves at a swift pace. This is really a great World War II movie."
4,Great old time British film,"This film would have been much more famous if Hitchcock had directed it. Ronald Neame does and excellent job. A true story of the Second World War with great locations (another good chance to get a look at the Spain of those times). But the fact that it is a true historical story makes it interesting enough.Besides, there's Gloria Graham doing an amazingly wonderful performance. It just amazed me how well she was in this role.This is the second film by Neame that I watch (after Tunes of Glory, which is even better) and both are wonderful movies.Typical, I would say, of the good-natured, common-man, and respectul films the British used to do before the Beatles generation. A bygone era of which this film reminds me with melancholy.The only thing that lessens a bit the value of ""The Man Who never Was"", in my opinion, is the other female character, who does not do such an excellent job as the rest of the cast."
1,"Incredibly slow, boring thriller based on a fascinating true story","I couldn't make it past the first ten minutes. It's that bad. I ordered it after reading Operation Mincemeat. The film is a sort anti-Ken Follet film--not the eye of the needle but the eye of a tunnel. No suspense, just boring dialogue between cardboard actors. Clifton Webb and the glorious Gloria Graham (in a bit part) couldn't save this belatedly patriotic and badly produced, low-budget film. (It was made in 1955). No wonder its out of print."
2,Live Suprise!,"This is a Live CD, which I did not expect since the product info does not specify that. I like some Live music but this is not what I wanted. Order a different one."
1,Wrong item!,"After receiving the cd in the mail, I opened it up and played it, and swore they shipped the wrong cd. This cd is Live, and they don't tell that in the details. It is also a poor version, even if you like Live music, I don't think you will like this."
1,"A few good, a lot bad","There are maybe 3 good movies in the bunch and seperately they are inexpensive movies. The rest are bad writing, directing, acting, etc. Several are ""foreign"" films I guess because the accents are so thick that the dialogue cannot be understood. I will usually sit through any movie at least once, some of these were so bad I shut them off before I finished watching them. If there are any you recognize that you don't own and are building a library, worth the price; but if you think you are getting 8 great movies at a low price, think again.DLP"
5,The Pacific Northwest's Best-Kept Musical Secret,"Mark is a phenomenally talented singer, songwriter, and blues harp player. Why the entire world doesn't know about him is a mystery. His clever, witty lyrics, powerful voice, and musicianship stand out on every cut of this CD. I already owned it, but bought this one as a gift for my sister who lives across the country, heard him live once, and was a goner!"
2,This Is Crap,"If you have no other way to hear this music, then go ahead and buy this cd. Cristina is great but this cd is obviously taken from vinyl and sounds horrible. You can actually hear the record static and the high hats will hurt your ears. I'm going to return mine."
1,Way too many ads,"In the February 2013 mag there are 40 full page adds for some kind of dietary suplaments and 18 other full page ads of a total of 120 pages. There are also a few 1/3 & 1/2 page ads. So all togather about half of the mag is advertisements. The mag is alsofull of graphics and full page pics. There are only a few articles and they are generally not presenting original, thought provoking material.I canceled my subscription after three issues. Maybe this mag is geared more toward body builders that can't read."
4,Men's Fitness,Men's Fitness has some great workout/exercise tips as well as some good dieting tips as well. It was easy to read on the kindle fire also.
5,Husband LOVES this magazine!,"I got this subscription as a gift for my husband. He loves it. He's really into staying fit and taking care of himself, like many other 20-30 year olds. And this magazine does a great job of writing about topics that are important to young male readers. A great buy. :)"
4,Not as good as it once was,"I've been a longtime subscriber to Men's Fitness. As one of the other reviewers said, this magazine used to be better. It still has a great deal of workout, diet and fitness information, but it's not as good as it once was. I think the magazine is losing its focus a bit as each issue does seem to have more and more about sex, pornography, etc.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because a lot of the workout and fitness information is still very useful (otherwise I would give it fewer), but I used to feel this magazine was worthy of 5 stars."
3,Not a big fan...,"I know that overall men's fitness should include sex (and lots of it) but I tire of hearing it from a magazine whose main focus should be fitness, wellness, and health. I'm not purposing to eliminate it completely, because as we all know sex sells, I just saying minimize it! I can read all about sex in Playboy! I would suggest buying Men's Health- it's a better read."
2,Its all shell.,"This magazine has great covers and gets your attention right away. I was was drawn to the cover because it claims to have great article inside, but the articles are very short and pointless. It was a good magazine few years back but now it just seems like they don't know what their doing."
1,"Pretty sad, fake pictures and nearly all adds.","Fake airbushed pictures, ie Andy Roddick. That guys arms turned out bigger than his waist. This magazine used to be okay. I think they spend more time with tanning, lights, make-up and Photoshop that they do with real athletes. If they cut out the ""4-page advertisements"" every 6 pages along with all the adds at back of the magazine it would consist of the cover and a 1/2 page article. They should pay people to accept it in the mail, hard to charge for a brochure. I just wish it was more ""real"" and less about selling us on smelling like roses and wearing $350 desinger shoes, cater to the average Joe who just wants to get good info and work-out ideas. I could watch QVC and MTV to cover any lack of B.S. I may be experiencing. Your best bet is to just surf the net, buy books, save your money."
4,Like the new format,I ordered this and it seemed to take a while to get the first magazine... Then when it showed up I got two the same day. I was pleasantly surprised to see that MF had changed their format and I had a chance to read the first and second issues. They are full of information and have a good division between the sound bite articles and articles that go into a good depth on a person or health issue.Overall a good read if you take the time to read it.
4,Look forward every month,Some really great articles. I've pulled three or four fantastic workouts out of this magazine.
4,Bonsai Pruner,"Nice and simple to use, especially for a beginner who is not looking to spend a fortune on the basics.Rust a little to quick if left out side (mostly my fault) but is easy enough to clean. They are sharp and do the job and I got 2 for my money. The also have a traditional Japanese look to them which I like!"
3,Trimmers,"I enjoy using trimmers rather than small scissors that cramp my fingers and cause blisters. However, this particular trimmer is not as good as other models I've used, plus, they were too much money for the way they are made!"
1,Review of Introductory Circuits for Electrical and Computer,I'm sorry to say this but this book is absolutely horrible. This is my third year in college and this has to be the worst text book I've ever had. The text is not very informative and the examples are unclear. The book doesn't go into detail on most of the basic material. This is NOT a good book for an introductory level circuit analysis course.
1,Don't waste your time,"I'm a second year EE engineering student with 20 years of electronics background in repairing, circuit analysis, and troubleshooting. This book is absolutly worthless. The auther jumps to great leaps of understanding with littel or no background to show the student how they got to those conclusions. The examples are non excistant. They use ""conventional current"" which is really backward to reality. It used to be called ""hole theory"" back in the day. Go with Boylstead or somone who has a clue about teaching. If your a beginning electronics student, forget this book, you'll be lost by the 1st chapter. There are countless problems too lengthy to go into detail here. If your school is using it, spend the extra money and get somthing to actually learn from, just to pass the course."
1,Really bad!,"This text book is absolutely horrible. I'm a third-year Mech Eng student. I've taken plenty of classes on hard subjects, so I know when a text book just plain sucks. This book does a pathetic job of explaining examples and basic concepts. I've spent hours trying to figure out assumptions that they should have just mentioned in the first place. And the poorly explained examples don't prepare you for the actual chapter problems. Because of the ""wordy"" writing style of the authors, basic concepts sound more complicated than they actually are; getting through the reading is a slow and tedious process.The book is utterly sterile. The only colors you'll see inside it are black and a little blue; there isn't even a picture of an actual circuit in this book. It's like it's writen for a machine."
2,Not good,"This book is not very helpful! It needs better examples and more info. I was disapointed, would not reccomend getting this book"
1,Required for course,"This book was required for a course, and the previous reviewers are correct...this book sucks. Also, I ordered the hardcover edition of this book, yet amazon in it's infinite wisdom (or is that total stupidity) sent me the softcover edition. Three weeks into the course and the binding is failing. Can't return the book because I need to have it in class, and I refuse to spend more money with a company that is unable to fulfill a simple order. Amazon, you suck at least as much as this book does! Perhaps Barnes and Noble will know the difference between hardcover and softcover."
4,Hidden Gem!!,"After listening to tracks off this CD on KKSF in San Francisco 15 years ago, I decided to search high and low for one of the last albums on the Columbia label by the jazz piano legend. I finally found a used version in a second hand book store for 5 bucks! It was worth the wait. ""My Love Leads You Home"" & ""Shamballa"" are the highlights on this 7 track CD, which I wish could have been longer. To this day, Ramsey Lewis continues to entertain and gives us a hard to find treasure!Buy it if you can find it!!"
1,False Intimacy has false determinations about God & sex,"This book was a complete turnoff. Instead of relating to scientific, psycological explanations of sexual addiction, the author blames everything on lack of closeness with God and not being saved by Jesus Christ. This author could use a good shrink. Take respondsibilty for your actions. Is God or the absense of him respondsible for everything. What a crank. Buy this book and go to seminary school. What a waste of time and money. Pure garbage. Now I need to buy another book to find out about my sexual addiction (psycologically) not spiritually."
3,Do not agree with described relationship between God & Man.,The symptoms of sexual addiction are described in no uncertain terms. The problem is identified and suggestions for correction are clear. Some comments about the nature of God and Man's relationship to God do not match my own beliefes which made it hard for me to accept some aspects of the book. I believe the book is still a good source of information (if you filter the theology) and a good starting point for overcoming sexual addiction.
1,An abomination,"I'm a Stanford-trained MD and practicing psychiatrist and I have to say that this book is worse than terrible. It is the most dangerous kind of religious propaganda mixed in with a hefty dose of hateful, spurious, ignorant ideas."
3,Maybe is better to go directly to a councelor,"This book treats the (wrong defined) subject of sexual addiction in a very superficial way. He doesn't approach the subject deeply and gives only a glimpse about the problem and ways of solution (in a espiritual councelor view), then he asks us to go to a councelor. So i think it is better idea to go directly to the councelor instead of spending money with this book. Chapter 7 (about sexual addiction in the church) is really an exception because it presents the matter in a deep and intelligent way."
3,"By now, it was only Bryan, Andy, & Phil","Short and simple: a ""Roxy Music"" DVD without Paul Thompson is like the Rolling Stones (God forbid) without Charlie Watts. ""Avalon"" is the DVD you want - refer to my review above."
2,Great Concert - Bad DVD,I have had this concert on VHS for almost 20 years and have been waiting for the DVD. I just purchased this today and to my surprise it seems like the picture and audio are not in sync. The sound and picture are about a second off from each other. Did anyone else encounter this problem or did I just get a bad DVD.
2,doesn't come with what's pictured......,"Does not come with gaskets!!!!!!!! These pictures are maddeningly misleading at times. I could have saved money buying another but this showed all I needed, but didn't come as promised."
5,Terrific new artist,"Merche (Mercedes Trujillo Callealta) is one of a number of fresh, young Spanish artists. As I understand it, she gave up a career in education to concentrate on music. As far as I am concerned it was a great decision. Her first album, on which she not only sings but also wrote most of the words and music, is a combination of great dance rhythms and a few excellent ballads. She has a strong, beautiful voice, and it is no wonder that her intitial foray into the music world has been a big hit in her native country. Personally, since I received this CD, I have listened to it again and again, and have not even begun to tire of it. Highly recommended!"
3,"Expensive, but its small gauge and does the trick","Not much to say; It's GE and its speaker wire. It works well, but it was too expensive."
1,totally unnecessary,"this product is ridiculous... all you need to remove garlic smell from hands is to rub your hands on ANY stainless steel item under running water. just about any knife in your kitchen will work, as will pots, cutlery, the sink itself, etc."
2,I don't think this works...,"I bought 4 of these to distribute as gifts to my mother, sister, sister in law and myself. We all cook with tons of garlic and I thought it would be the perfect gift. We tried using the eggs after a day of intense cooking and it didn't seem to work. Ours hands still smelled of garlic and onions."
5,Excellent review of Mythology through early Christianity,This book provided a fascinating review of early Middle Eastern mythology starting from Mesopotamian culture and proceeding through to Judaism and early Christianity. It also includes a discussion of the importance of myth and ritual as a basis for religious and socialogical structure. The area I found most interesting was the discussion of the influence of the mythology of early civilizations on Judeo-Christian belief and scripture.
5,Fantastic eye openerThis,"I am so glad I found out about this book. Reading it was a major eye opener for me in understanding the early myths from the area where my own (former) religion originated. S. H. Hooke is an expert in mythology, and he does a fantastic job of showing the connections between the myths of the Middle East. For me personally, this helped me see how the roots of Christianity (particularly with ancient Hebrew religions) was inspired greatly by earlier myths. Whether it was the author's intention or not, it also helped me realize that the religion I once thought was real was, in fact, nothing more than a myth that was not unlike so many similar myths of the time and place.Jeff Mark, author ofChristian No More"
3,Anthology withour authos' names,"I just bought the book ""The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica"" and ""The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica"" from Amazon. I find there's some question in edition of the two books. As anthologies, the books include many novels, but they do not have bibliography and I can not firnd authors' names of these novels,we even want to know more about these authors' information. Anyway, the books should indicate which novles are full and others are excerpts(we should know the excerpt from which chapter of the original novel ).I have no idea of them. So I am not very satisfactory of the two books."
4,Best Flamenco Album of Azucar Moreno,"Azucar Moreno is a Spanish band with 2 lead lady singers. I first came across this group in the flamenco movie ""El Amor Brugo"" - the original classic music is composed by De Falla, a Spanish composer. Via Amazon I was able to purchase 4 albums by Azucar Moreno. The Exitos Originales album has the true Flamenco pop music - it also features the song ""Azucar Moreno"" that appears in the movie I spoke of. The other tracks are similar in nature and could have been part of that movie. This makes the album vary Flamenco balanced."
3,It started off really well...,"...But the tenderness and fireworks that marked the pair in the beginning of the book, the sparks that made the couple so special seemed to fade as the necessity to wrap up the mystery moved to the forefront. Our hero and heroine were simply on a collision course of love, and I never believed that anything would keep them from it. Once the mystery was inevitably resolved, all that was left was for them to fall into each others arms.""If A Man Answers"" was obviously well researched, and I give Ms. Lovelace full points for setting the scene. There were some good moments, no doubt about it - but ultimately this book isn't going to be a keeper."

2,Santa's gone surfin'.,"The idea was a good one: surf music versions of Christmas songs. But the excecution leaves a lot to be desired. The problem is that, while the album has the trappings of surf music, it doesn't feel like ""real"" surf music. Probably because ""The Wave Benders"" aren't a real surf group. The album was recorded by a bunch of studio musicians in Amsterdam, of all places. So, what we have here is an album of generic ""surf music"" versions of Christmas songs."
3,Good work but undistinguished,"For $89 it would be nice to have an updated supplement (For example, page 36, paragraph 2 starts ""The FCC has until August 8, 1996, in which to ...."")The CCMI LATA Map reprinted on pages 20-21 is not even half-toned and as a result is partially unreadable.The actual text they wrote is only 170 pages. Don't get me wrong; they convey a lot of knowledge in those pages. However the rest of the 600 pages is the reprinted Telecomm Acts of 1934 and 1996 and two other outdated tables.Welcome to the world of what I'd call low-volume trade press."
5,Foster Parenting Abused children- a review,"This pamphlet serves as a wonderful resource to both those in profesional fields dealing with child abuse as well as those lay persons just entering this world through their consideration of foster parenting. As a researcher I was greatful for such a compact, to the point resource. As someone working with parents I was greatful for the open and easy to understand writing style of Eliana Gil. I have found all of Eliana Gil's works most useful and am greatful that this resource is available to those out there who may not be as interested in her works which are written in a more scholarly (although still understandable) voice."
5,Los Fantasma del Caribe are great!!!,I really love Los fantasmas del Caribe they have great music and sound. I love all their material from Caramelo to Mas Y Mas. I completly recommend all their cds. They will have u dancing all night.
2,This Book is NOT for NXT,"It's a great book. But the Mindstorms microproessor is now NXT -- it has been updated. Until this book is updated, you'd be better off to find a good book which is based on the NXT system."
5,Great Lego book,"One of the best Lego books out. Very high quality graphics and pictures. A nice collection of great projects. Full of interesting topics and tricks for Mindstorms. Covers RCX code, Robolab, NQC, and Visual Basic. RCX communication, Internet control, data logging, etc. Includes a CD and a useful parts list. Enough material to keep young minds and adults busy playing and learning."
1,Character sheets with different pictures,"Well, I expected this to contain a bunch of character sheets customized for the different occupations. Instead all it is is a few character sheets that have the picture from the main book of the different drawings of the different occupations and then a bunch of blank character sheets that you can download from the website for free. Also they are bound in the book so you can't take them out to photo copy them without tearing them out, or you just leave them in there but there is no customization at all. They're all the same. Really not worth buying. Just go to www.sengoku.com and download the character sheet for free and if you really want a picture in the blank space just photocopy it from the main book and paste it in."
4,great material hampered by poor layout,"Somewhere in this great history book there's a game. The authors have definitely done their homework in studying the culture of late 16th century Japan. They've also got a great filmography and bibliography at the back. As far as content is concerned, Sengoku sets the bar quite high for historical RPGs. The actual conversion of this historical information into a playable game is, however, a bit awkward. The book is also seriously hampered by the amateurish artwork and layout reminiscent of RPGs of 30 years ago. Still, I've worn the cover off my copy of the book so its obviously a worthwhile read."
3,"Great read, until you start to think about it","This is one of those books that grips you while you read it. You'll never forget it. But after you read it, you'll remember the plot and think, ""Wait a minute, how could that have happened?""Considering the shocks and surprises, though, this story hanges together pretty well. The plot structure hides secrets so that they can come back at you. The author uses flashbacks really well.This book also came me my first glimpse into life in the Hamptons. That was almost as scary as the murders!Anne M. Marble Reviewer, All About Romance"
2,Interesting yet fairly predictable and corny,"I read this book as a result of reading the reviews at this site. While the story held my interest and I had to see it through, I thought the writting was corny and the dialogue phony and juvenille. Eventually all of the sexual overtones became annoying and unrealistic. Perhaps the author would have had better success as a ""Young Adult"" writter, because, despite the sex, that is how this book came across."
4,nice,it's a nice bra for support. i like it because it's full coverage. it's pretty much the same as my other victoria secret bras. but i paid less. :)
3,"Great scholarship, cumbersone format, moderate contribution","The WBC Genesis commentary, vol. 1, by Wenham, follows the series' format, which has technical material first, then scholarly textual evaluation and criticism, finishing with the commentary. For all but the most diligent Hebrew scholars, the first section will be overkill. For those who hold a high view of scriptural inspiration, the documentary theories and sympathetic comments about late editing found int the middle section will frustrate and lessen credibility. The commentary is solidly done, and while not agreeing at every point, I find it generally very helpful and worth consulting."
5,Word Biblical Commentary - Genesis,"Gordon Wenham has produced a first-class exegetical commentary of Genesis. The bibliographies cover a full range of topics and authors. For each section of the biblical text, he begins with textual notes which are quite valuable to those familiar with the ancient languages. Next he addresses issues of form and structure. Finally, he provides a verse-by-verse commentary. In the process, he addresses various approaches and viewpoints in an even-handed and fair way."
5,This book should be on our shelves as Pastors,"I cannot imagine a less user-friendly layout than the Word Biblical Commentary Series. The series is uneven, and occasionally goes overboard in literary/source criticism. But one up-to-date, critical commentary on Genesis should be on our shelves, and this is about the best."
4,Awesome baby prunes!,My daughter loves these! The only thing I wish they would change would be to make the package recyclable.
1,SUTURE SELF,Mary Daheim has obviously NOT had a hip replaced or she would of known that you DO need a walker and not just a wheel chair to get around after and that physical therapy starts one day after surgery. Also the obnoxious Renie sounds like a real jerk with all her screaming and whatever in a hospital. One sure can not wash their hair and take a shower after shoulder surgery either. This it the first book of the series I've read and don't know if I want to read another silly one of hers. Mary Daheim should do more research on her books and quit putting them out so fast!!!!
4,One of the best of the series,"Everyone is a little leery of hospitals, but Good Cheer has good reason to make Judith and Renie nervous. Two high profile patients have recently died after fairly routine surgery. Judith needs a hip replacement, and Renie is scheduled for shoulder surgery. The night after their operations, a well known ex football player in the next room dies as well. Since they have nothing to do but think about what's going on, Judith and Renie put their minds to solving the mystery and to find out aabout the other strange things happening at Good Cheer hospital.This is the best that this series has produced in a long time. Hospitals are naturally creepy and this one is really strange. The setting of a hospital isolated after a snow storm really adds to the drama. Enjoy it, I did!"
3,Give this one a pass...,"I always get excited when I seem Mary Daheim's name as the author of a new bed-and-breakfast mystery...or at least I always USED to get excited. ""Suture Self"" takes place in a hospital--the ultimate bed and breakfast--and is as cutsey and improbable as its title implies. The largest problem is the location, as you might guess: it's difficult to have three murders on your floor, have the various characters wander in your room and confess, and observe the hit and run from your hospital window. It just doesn't work. And the humor that Daheim usually exhibits doesn't work either: it's strained and artificial, filled with weak puns and plays on words.I'm saddened to see Daheim turn out such a weak product: this is a formulaic novel based on her past work but, unlike the hospital in which it is set, the novel is sterile and lacking in credibility and color."
1,Needs a lot of doctoring,"An anemic effort from someone who is touted on the cover as a best-selling author. I'd go back and check out the titles that gave her that status instead of reading this book.Very weak characters, an obvious mystery, too-convenient plot devices every other page, cheap shocks that make you feel stupid when you find out what they are, characters that literally fall into the hospital room so they can spill their guts -- or confessions -- to our bed-ridden mystery solver... And someone has the gall to compare her to Miss Marple. (She blushes modestly when they do so.)Search a little farther on Amazon and I'm sure you'll find something that is worth your time. Try Janet Evanovich or Katy Munger. Their stuff will treat you as if you're an adult reader and not a child."
4,Mysterious hospital deaths,"Judith McMonigle Flynn needs to have a hip replacement, coincidentally at the same time that her cousin Renie is having shoulder surgery. They are a little apprehensive about their admission to Good Cheer Hospital, because there seems to be a rash of deaths of basically healthy people who have recently had surgery at the hospital. There is a rumor of a takeover of Good Cheer and there are plenty of quirky hospital employees as well as relatives of the deceased which gives Judith a long list of suspects. Her husband is working on a case dealing with homeless people and Judith suspects that there is a connection to the case she's working on. Undaunted by her surgery, Judith travels around the hospital in her wheel chair and, as usual, manages to solve the mystery before the police. This is another enjoyable book in the Bed-and-Breakfast series."
2,Time to quit series!,"I have read each Bed & Breakfast thru #25. I kept hoping that Mary Daheim might get back into her groove. Not so. Somewhere along the line, the books have lost their charm. Renie has developed a severe overbite, with prominent front teeth, which is heavily focused on in the last few books. She has also gotten quite an attitude, making it difficult to get along with anyone. Added to that is Renie and Bill's ridiculous storyline of dressing their pet bunny, and in other books, being obsessed with their stuffed gorilla. They even go so far as to have Oscar the gorilla held hostage and have to negotiate for him! PLEASE!Gertrude's acided tongue has never entertained me, as realistically no one would put up with the verbal abuse heaped on throughout the years. Judith has turned into a doormat.On the plus side, I have read most of the Alpine Series, and so far they are delightful. But I will pass on the Bed & Breakfast series from now on."
3,costume-y,"Arrived in a very pretty box. The silver and the CZ's were a bit bigger than I would have liked, which made it seem a little costume-y."
3,"Decent book, but already becoming quite outdated.","It was nice to have a PostNuke book to use as a reference guide since there are no others out there (as of 12/2007). The book provided informative background on PostNuke as well as other modules and blocks you can add. The information however can be found online after a bit of searching. Like any other technology book, they do become outdated, and this one is getting there. A number of links to 3rd party modules are no longer available, and some info is no longer pertinent to PostNuke V.8.Still, I was able to find some core information I needed. I'd only pay $15 for it now."
1,Requires too much strength for toddlers,"The springs on this toy are extremely tight, making it very difficult for babies and toddlers to operate. Althouhg it is nice to see dinosaurs instead of all the other familiar characters, all of the other pop-up boxes I've seen ""reward"" the child by popping up with much less hand strength required."
1,not safe and no fun,once you get this toy in your hands you can see the cheap construction--the buttons don't work smoothly and the egg-tops are easy to pull off: just the right size for my toddler to pop in his mouth! i chucked this one right in the garbage....
2,Of little interest,"My 18 month old received this as a gift for his 1st birthday. I agree that the buttons are too hard to push, they work great if he steps on them. It is indestractable, believe me he has thrown it, sat on it and stepped on it. Problem is, he could care less. We tried playing with him, naming the colors and shapes. One shot through the line-up and he was off looking for something else to do. In my opinion, it's just not interesting enough."
5,Britney,"I think this C.D. is great. She has a wonderful voice. I love the beats, they are really good. Most of the reviews I have seen always compare the singer to Britney Spears though(Not just Stacie's reviews). I love Brit, she is my fav. singer. I wish that everyone would stop trashing Britney because she shows her stomach. Regardless of what she wears she is still a christian, no one's perfect anyways. As christians we must not judge, people seem to think that christians are judgmental and scrutinizers. Christians, think about what you say before you say it. There is no need to talk badly of others-just something to think about."
1,"""eh"" What was I thinking?","Ok I loath britney and Christina.And though I'm more of a Rock Music kinda guy myself, even I sometimes get pulled in by alot of catchy tunes from the secular pop music world. And sometimes I hate myself for singing that shallow filth. Stacie is SO GREAT! I've heard all the songs from her album. They're all so good, and the quality is far beyond Britney or Christina. Cause the only good songs on any of there albums are typically the singles. Stacie's lyrics are uplifting, but never cheesy. The beats are too hot! She sounds nothing like a 14yr old. I am now an official Fan and will buy anything she comes out with! I think she's way better then Rachael Lampa, but thats only cause her music has faster beats."
5,Stacie can stand on her own.,"Stacie's voice is strong and clear. This album (can I still call it an ""album""? I'm dating myslef!) is superb. My young daughter loves it too and it is a joy to hear her singing the words. My only complaint is that the male voice in the background is really unnecessary. Her powerful voice can stand on it's own. Overall, it's superb and outstanding!"
5,I LOVED it! ^__^,"I really loved this CD! *___* There wasn't one song on this CD I didn't like, but my favorites were: Ride, 0.0 Baby, So Pray, Holdin' On, and Everything.But I give every song (...Except the interludes...) 5/5. ^__^"
5,a great cd for teens,this cd is a great christian cd that appeals to teans and still shows somewhat of a christian sound. stacie has a great voice thats very mature 14.
3,Hmmm...,"I have been listening to this for a while now. I seem to be growing out of it. My first concert was a Stacie Orrico concert. I was 7. (I'm now 12.) I don't seem to like her as much anymore, but I still think she has got major talent. Bring up the age level, like she did in ""Stuck,"" and I think we'd have a winner. Praise God!P. S. Psalm 23"
5,The best Christian CD ever!,"Stacie Orrico has managed to take Christian music to another level with Genuine! Anyone who dares to call her ""the Britney Spears of Christian music"" needs a wake-up call! Britney is awesome, but Stacie will put her to shame! Such songs as Don't Look At Me, O.O. Baby, Stay True, and Holdin' On both have a groove and a message. Then, there's the ballads, like Without Love, Everything, and Dear Friend, a song Stacie herself wrote for her anorexic friend. This album is filled, not with artificial things, but that which is genuine...no pun intended. Although Stacie has tapped into the teen pop phenomenon respresented by such secular artists as Mandy Moore, Christina Aguilera, and of course, Britney Spears, Stacie sings about real life issues, such as peer pressure, idolizing someone else, temptation to do wrong, and even marriage and dating. Stacie is the coolest Christian singer ever. Rock on!"
3,Pretty good I guess,"I cant complain but it was decent. I bought it and listened to it once through but it didn't move me enough to listen again. Wasn't bad - it was recorded well, just might be me."
4,Satisfied,I paid 50 cents for this. Which was not bad at all. It was in good conditions for the price. One of the song did skip a little. But over all it was great for the price.
4,Good CD,"As a historic re-enactor, I'm always looking for good music. I also liked the 1 click purchase feature and downloads.You don't get liner notes. This is something Amazon should work on!I would recommend this to folks who enjoy the period."
3,good bag,I bought this to haul around clothing when going on short trips or to hold one pair of shoes. It does its job for both.Edit on 12/14/11:Strings came untied and left me with no straps and probably will come undone again if I tie these together again.
2,disappointing read,"Yes it is truly amazing what the man accomplished andI cannot take anything away from his feat.His book, on the other hand, I was sorry that I bought.After the first 3 chapters I gave up. Barely making itout of the desert. Maybe I'll pick it up at a later datebut I just got tired of ""Day 1: I ran"", ""Day 2: I ran"",""Day 3:I ran, it rained""... yawn.I need a book to convince my wife to hike for more than10 days at a stretch and this fell far short.Not recommended"
5,good movie,If you are a Chuck Norris fan like me you will enjoy this movie.I remember watching this movie yrs ago remembered the movie but not its proper name until amazon suggested movies to me.
5,Great Service,Fast delivery and in wonderful condition. Would buy again anytime from this person. Thank you.
4,Priced Right,"We bought this to fill a duvet cover for summer. It's light weight, as we needed, and serves its purpose, considering the price and quality. Other similar light weight comforters in the marketplace cost 4+ times this one. No sales tax & no shipping (Amazon Prime) help make this a good deal."
4,Lightweight and Warm,"The comforter is not lofty, but does ""fluff up"" nicely. It's lightweight, but don't let that fool you ... it will keep you warm. I gave it 4 stars only because the loft is low, but it really doesn't affect the warmth of the product. Great for a guest room. Buy it!"
4,Great Fun of a book,"The book is very entertaining and leaves you wanting to read more of Sue Kaufman's writings.Not a ""life changing"" piece, but certainly very engaging story.You become familiar with the heroine and feel involved in the story.I recommend reading this book if you need to relax and have some fun."
5,Classic,"It's a classic for a reason, folks. Extremely amusing and spot-on accurate. A very humorous account of the universal quest for meaning that has surely depressed the mess out of us all at some point or other. Style so good you forget to be jealous and just enjoy.A short review is not an insult. I strongly suggest that you find out about this book from one of those professional reviewer sorts. If you do that, you'll buy it. Alternately, just check your local library, get it if they have it, and prepare to get sucked right into reading this as quickly as you possibly can because it's just that damn good."
5,"Powerful Self-Talk, Change Your Self-Talk, Change Your Life","I found this CD program to have very simple yet powerful ideas that I have already implemented in my life. Michael Russ speaks about the way to make changes is to change the way I talk with myself. Very cool!This is clearly one of the best programs I have ever heard, I think Michael Russ will be one of the up and coming stars in the self help business."
3,Not bad but not great either,"I didn't learn anything new here, but only because I had already learned what he had to teach elsewhere. His advice is good and self-talk IS really powerful. I do re-listen to this CD occasionally. His voice sounds very peppy...a little bit annoying at first but I got used to it after a while."
2,very basic self talk,"This CD was really only an overview of self talk, and didn't provide any real self talk, like a Shad Helmstetter or other more well known writer."
3,It is OK.,"It is not a bad CD, but I expected more from it. I would rather recommend to read a book What To Say When You Talk To Your Self by Shad Helmstetter, Ph.D."
1,This is not the screenplay,"This is the script for the stage play, which has been updated for modern times. If you are looking for the script for the 1987 film, keep looking."
5,Retrospect,"Awesome book, written many years ago but still is relevant to us today in 2012! Hudson Taylor was a man of Godly wisdom! I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book of inspiration and mission work."
4,Proclear sponge,This is not the correct size for the proclear 300 it needs to be cut down to fit. which isnt a problem but it should be mentioned because the part that gets cut down is wasted.
5,Really makes a difference,Limbsavers reduce the kick of large calibre mil surp rifles. The slip-ons eliminate the need for stock butt modifications if you can put up with an additional inch of pull. Highly recommended.
4,His Second Album,"Anderson followed up his debut with an equally strong album. By this time the formula for future Anderson albums was in place: strong honky-tonk originals, a love song or two, a novelty song and just plain hardcore country. Two songs from this album went Top 10 Country (""Chicken Truck"" and ""I'm Just An Old Chunk Of Coal""). There are no liner notes here, but the sound is excellent. Anderson was one of a select few who brought traditional Country back to the charts. If you're a fan of real Country than this makes an excellent purchase."
2,a good historical book,"if you like history books read this, if not dont waste your time its boring from beginning to end but it gives you a good idea of what life was like for afro\amer. after the civil war"
4,A good product,This product works very well in my smoker. The Pecan smoke flavor is excelent for fish and I was able to save over .20 cents per biscuit by purchasing them through Amazon.
5,Good flavor to meat.,The bisquettes are very good and added flavor to the meat.I would recommend them to anyone wanting to use them.
3,Looks like they are cut out of cheap plywood.,But work as promised. Would have expected a more quality-looking product for the price. Wonder how much real mesquite is in this and not just some chemical. Hmm...
1,Worst CD I bought in 5 years,"I preordered this CD. I just listen to it for the second time. This is satire at it's most boring. Don't bother with this CD. Ry has done much more interesting stuff, both lyrically and musically. Listen to the samples before you buy. I wish I did. If you like what you hear ignore this and go with your own tastes but for me ""yuck!"""
5,My Name Is Buddy CD,Adorable songs about Buddy the cat who goes on a trip with just hissuitcase. Great old songs. Kind of jazzy with blues undertones. Thestories of Buddy's journey are timely. Very enjoyable for people wholove Cats and jazz & blues. Love it!Linda
2,quite boring...,"I've been a fan of Ry Cooder's recordings for a long time, but noe I prefer him more like producer of other artist's records (listen to the latest M. Staples one..). ""My name is Buddy"" should be changed in ""My name is BORING"": I can save only 4/5 good songs (NOT masterpieces) in this cd, the sound is disjointed and the voice of Ry seems is really too tired...Finally, listening to the latest Ry's album, my favourite remains Chavez Ravine, that is strange and not perfect, but much better than Buddy!"
2,What a disappointment,"On the bright side - Flaco Jimenez is a boon to nearly anything, and ""Footprints in the Snow"" provides a welcomed return after the joys of ""Do Re Mi"" and the Show Time set, 30 years ago. Less bright, left-leaning critters bringing a 1930's update to ""Life is Like a Mountain Railway."" I appreciated Marlon Brando and Randy Quaid in Missouri Breaks more. Twisting the world, yet again, through the poor-me prism of the Wobblies lacks for the reflective thought I'd come to expect from such an outstanding musician. More bright - Boomer's Story, or Jazz, or the recent work with David Lindley, or any of a dozen other touchstones. I suppose they can't all be jems."
3,Sorry Ry...,"...but this album borders on the juvenile. And the songs are poorly phrased. This package is destined for the bargain bins.Now, let's hear from more of those folks who couldn't write a negative review if their life depended on it....Those are the ones that always wind up at the top of Amazon's Customer reviews."
4,What's old is new again,"Ry Cooder has held a special place in my head and heart for several decades, I have never been disappointed in his work. Every album has been a new adventure, a journey to new a place somewhat real and somewhat imagined. There are a couple of things about ""Buddy"" that I find interesting, maybe a bit telling. This is the third album he has used the UFO idea in a song, 1982's 'Slide Area' opens with ""A UFO Has Landed In The Ghetto"", 2005's masterful 'Chavez Ravine' has ""El UFO Cayo"" and 2007's 'My Name Is Buddy' has ""Green Dog."" ""Green Dog"" also strongly recalls ""My Little Town"" from 'Chavez Ravine' even using using some of the same lyrics. As usual, the musicianship and production values are without parallel, the freshness of some of the writing is suspect, though."
4,Great can for the price,"Can't go wrong for this price, I mean you're getting a metal step can for this price. The only drawback is its size, but it worked great for what I needed it for."
3,Not great,"Not such a great step can since when you step on it if it's on carpet, the entire can moves, which is annoying. Also, annoying when the lid slams down loudly when replacing the inner container (especially since this is in a baby room)."
4,Great Value for this Trash Can,"This is a very affordable product with a very sleek look, and I've been very happy with it. I actually have two of these. My partner and I started using the one we had as a trash can solely for used cat litter, so we got a second one to use for any other bathroom trash. A normal plastic takeout bag fits perfectly as a liner. The only thing I would change is to give it a little more weight towards the bottom of the can so that stepping on the pedal wouldn't make an empty can tilt."
3,"Liked it, had to send it back","This was a good price and exactly what I wanted. However, it came with a dent in the top. Amazon made the return really easy and free. I am waiting for the refund, but anticipate it won't be a problem."
3,Strong smell,"I gave it three stars, as I really could not say if it works or not. For me it has such a strong smell, kind of minty , makes my face tingle slightly that I decided for the high price it was not worth it.I did hear a lot of great things about exuviance products and will try out some others, their toner I know is really good, I got to try a bit of it, it definitely removed all remaining make up after you wash your face, it has a bit of a orangy smell, but the smell goes away within less then a min. and it might just be the way how I preceive the smell."
4,Nice but not the best,"I wanted to try this moisturizer since I love Exuviance foundation. I was hoping I'd also fall in love with this skin treatment. I can't criticize anything specific, but I didn't love it. It has a nice texture, and a little goes a long way. It does make my skin feel soft, and the scent isn't too heavy. For a similar price,though, I think I prefer the Olay Pro-X or Regenerist line. Primary reason? I did have a few small break-outs after using Exuviance Restorative Complex for a couple of weeks. Did the Exuviance cause this? I'm not sure. With the easy availability of Olay, I think I'll return to that family of skin care products."
5,Great Latin entertainment,"The best ever, buy and enjoy hours of music by many popular latin singers who have performed over the years. Thank you for the tribute of Celia Cruz befor her death. Buy today."
3,Interesting TV-show,I prefer concerts that can be reviewed again and again - like Gloria Estefan Unwrapped. This one is a one-time review of Latin stars - but not about Celia Cruz.
2,"Good overview of breads in the world, not a good recipe book","This book starts with the usual 'bread book' introduction--explaining different grains, various methods of making bread,equipment etc. Then half of the book is devoted on introducing breads in different regions of the world. The rest is bread recipes from each part of the world.The pictures are nice and gives us an idea of what bread is in Germany, in France, in Japan, in the middle east. However, when I tried a couple of the recipes, they all turned out below average--and I am experienced in bread-making. I would suggest people who want to 'bake' to look somewhere else, such as 'the village baker'"
3,"So-So Product, German, Dubbed in English",Item is not what I expected in that it is German language with English dub. Wasn't too impressed with bike setup segment in that it covered seat height adjustment but didn't discuss the proper way to adjust the handlebars. The workout section is pretty good and challenging for spinning beginners. You get what you pay for...worth the 12 bucks or so that I paid but nothing to call home about.
2,Worst dubbing ever!,"Fast beat motivating music. Average workout. But the dubbing is so bad as to be comically distracting. Might be better if you speak German, but with English dubbing, it's intolerable."
2,Inaccurate description,"My suburban hot water heater drains where the Anode rod is. It is 1 1/16 and the wrench description does not indicate it is for, I believe, a Pet Cock fitting. Camco should better describe this item showing the size fitting it is designed for. Camco should know better."
3,Warning - does not fit normal drains,"Warning, this is for petcock drain valves. I doesn't work with the 'normal' plastic drain plug. Now I have to send it back."
2,Did Not Work For Me,"Not at all what I needed because it did not fit. I expected that it would be a general universal RV water heater drain valve wrench, but I was wrong I guess. I have a Minnie Winnegago, and have a water heater that is a very common one used. I wasted my money. I had alreay thrown away the package so now I can't return it. Wish I would have known it would not work. The product itself isn't bad quality, but I thought the title and description of this product was not accurate."
4,plastic tool,works ok but not really enough clearance to use on the water heater valve and is made out of plastic
5,Fun little guy,"Picked up my Tachikoma from AX '06. To address some questions: Arms and legs do not have a wire frame inside so it will not hold a pose. Eyes do not turn. Tightly stuffed so it will hold its shape. Go ahead and order it, it's too fun not to own."
5,Hard to find but works great,I've been using these for years but for some reason they are no longer available in any of the grocery stores near me. I like them because they offer enough friction to clean tough stains (especially when used with BarKeeper's Friend) but they don't scratch my stainless steel pots the way steel wool used to. They also work great on my stainless steel cook top. I bought a case which reduced the price per item and spread out the shipping.
5,great stuff,"We can't find these in stores anymore, which is a shame, since nothing else works as well."
5,great stuff,These are just the beat scrubbies I'ver used. They don't scratch and they last forever. None of my local stores carry them anymore.
3,They changed it!,I have been buying this product from the time it first caming on the market. But now it appears that they changed it's texture and it doesn't work as well as before.
4,Get them at ACE HARDWARE,Ace Hardware still carries this product in regular stock for 1.99 a box. Cheap.There's you source. Sorry amazon vendors.
3,"Good plot, poor grammar","Night In Eden has a great plot with interesting twists. But, unfortunately, her poor grip on the English language made it a chore to read. She had a lax way of talking and repeated herself too much. Did she write this book for children or for adults? But, she did have a good plot... and it was her only saving grace. I won't be looking for her novels again!"
3,Very difficult to review,"Proctor is a gifted writer and she has done a wonderful job with the characters in 'night in eden'. They are multi dimensional and you truly know them inside out. The plot is very different and the twist in the end is very unexpected. Thus far I would rate it a 5........but I really hate books written in the outback, and aboriginies, etc....And that took a great deal of the enjoyment out of it for me. Of course this entire book only WORKS in that setting so it must be. If u like australia, you'll probably like this book. I did a lot of skimming......"
5,This is a winner for fat burning & weight loss,"I did a lot of research, and this product has the best ingredients, and the highest amounts of brown guggul. I have only been taking it about a week but I have lost about 3-4 pounds. It doesn't contain any stimulant like caffeine, so I don't get that jittery feeling. The suggested usage is 1-2 capusules twice a day, the bottle doesn't say whether to take before or after you eat, but I take it before breakfast after my morning coffee. And I have no nausea or anything. I take 2 capsules twice a day, it does raise your body temperature, and has increased my metabolism. I haven't changed my diet or exercised and its working. I will be ordering this again when I run out. And this company had speedy delivery, I received my order within 3 days."
3,Headaches!,"I have Hypothyroidism and was so excited to get this after doing tons of research. I have come up with sad results, I first started to take 2caps at bedtime and 1cap in the morning. I was quickly stricken with horrible migraine headaches for the entire 3 days I took that amount. So, I cut them back to once a day at bedtime with no headaches, and no change in energy or temperature. I will continue to take them until they are all gone and see if there are any other changes.I wish you all good luck with this product.The shipper was great and it was in great condition."
2,not a healthy product,"I started this a week ago and within one day of taking it as directed, i developed hives and full body rash. I know the possibility of these side effects was stated, but the degree is more extreme than expected. I stopped taking it on Tuesday and it is now Friday. The incredibility itchy rash continues. Use at your own risk."
3,"Not his best, c'mon but not bad!","Okay, I agree this isn't Carlton's best work. It's clearly a CD intended more for commercial radio air play than building the guitarist's reputation. But, to me that doesn't necessarily mean the music is bad--and it isn't. In fact, some of it is very, very good.For me, the best of the CD are the two ""Put it where you want it tracks"". It's a piece I really like and it's fun listening to Carlton come back to it after all these years. The rest of the CD isn't exciting but it's listenable and I also like ""Roll with it"" and the title track.On the one hand if you're looking to start with Carlton's solo music, you need to start with something else, something earlier in his catalog. But if you're a fan then I'd say get this--just keep your expectations in line with what this CD is about: safe, commercial-sounding, but excellently played and recorded. And it's still Carlton here and he still manages to come through to me at least!"
1,Was Larry alive when he made this? Terrible!,"1. Yes--> I am a Larry Carlton fan--> I've seen him numerous times over the years. As a baseline, my favorite albums are his earlier efforts etc... My favorite song (s) are strikes twice and mulberry street.2. Which makes this all the more frustrating--> how can such a great musician turn out such... completely boring music? I don't understand it and I guess I never will. The bottomline is--> if you tend to like neutral, tepid music (ie background music)--> this will be fine. Otherwise, skip this effort via Larry and pray that he comes back to life and puts out a good album."
2,Should put his talent to better use....,"Larry Carlton is one fine guitarist, and fails to show off his talent in this latest release. The session musicians and far to prominent and mask out his playing. I would love to hear Larry Carlton solo, or with bass and drum only."
2,What happened to Larry Carlton?,The elevator has arrived. Mr. Carlton's latest effort is so lackluster and unimaginative that I frankly can't believe it! He has been a wonderful player over the years and my library is full of his work. This album appears to be dedicated to the proposition that a raised pulse is risky. It is almost a forced melancholy. Riffs are dull and the whole work seems stifled by a desire to be background music to a car ad or something. What a drag!!
4,Larry Carlton-Deep Into It,"Carlton does it again. The veteran jazz guitarist's second release in as many years does not dissapoint. It is one of the best Jazz albums I've purchased or heard this year. This ten track CD plus one bonus track is full of gems. Especially his cover of the Eagles ""I Can't Tell You Why"" with R&B artist Shai doing guest vocals on the track. It is a smooth jazz version. He also covers Steve Winwood's ""Roll With It"". If you're a fan of Carlton, Fourplay or just jazz, check this CD out. It's Carlton at his best."
2,Larry's Careful New Album,"I've been a fan of Larry Carlton for quite some time, and I still listen to the ""Sleepwalk"" album and find it to be just as vibrant now as when it came out. Larry has always been a tasteful player but with just a bit of edge to make things interesting. This new album sounds much too carefully drawn. The guitar is too far down in the mix and Larry seems to be playing session man on his own album. The 2 selections with vocals don't really add anything for anyone looking for Larry Carlton. I hope his next album finds him reaching a bit and taking some chances."
5,Great music to listen to. Highly recommend.,This is a great CD with wonderful music to listen to. Larry Carlton is a very talented musician and I'll look forward to buying more of his music.
1,Crap,"This dvd was in some other region format, wouldnt even play on my dvd player. They should be more specific when offering products that arent compatible with us electronics ! I will never shop here again!"
5,see this flik,"Voodoo-like anti-hero, super hot gun toting anti-heroin, oh yea! If you haven't seen this flik your F^&-ing up."
2,Didint understand much,"I'm not sure what the plot was for this movie, I really don't know what i got the movie either maybe i wasn't in the right frame of mind or maybe it was cause of the sex scenes? i don't know but wasn't all that great."
1,Dance with the Devil,This movie was ridiculously overpriced. The acting is horrible; the plot is nonexistent. The DVD didn't even have so much as a commentary track. I guess I learned my lesson--never give Rosie Perez a second chance.
3,Voodoo and a crime spree,"When you are already down, there isn't much further to go. Two people who already have criminal tendencies start to excite each other with their crimes, their ""macho"". You throw in Voodoo and kidknapping, rape and white collar crimes of business. It is very exciting and strange from beginning to end. If immorality and vicious crimes are what you are looking for, this may be more than 3 stars. Rosie Perez is very believeable. ...."
4,Miller's overlooked art,"Steve Miller is probably the world's most underated guitarist. He is also very underated as an artist. Your Saving Grace is no exception. The title track is heavy with emotion and while not writen by Miller, shows off the talent of Tim Davis who was the backbone of the early stuff. The forcefull lovesong ""Little Girl"" and the civil rights motif ""Don't you let nobody"" are solid rock tracks with a hint of blues and a lot of attitude. ""Baby's House"" shows off the piano skills of Nicky Hopkins as well as Miller's strength as a vocalist. If you have Miller's box set you are missing out on the full version of this awesome song. ""Motherless Children"" has a blues twing and a solid emotional base that makes it a classic. While the album is short, it is a good buy. For the Miller enthusist it is well worth it. If not, you might want to start off his early stuff with Antholgy."
3,Renewed but Not Remastered!,"Your Saving Grace is the only one of the first five Steve Miller Band CD's to have gone out of print. It makes it's reentry into the CD market with this Japanese reissue. However, this is NOT REMASTERED! None of these Japanese pressings are. They sound identical to the domestic releases that have been available for over a decade."
5,"Clean,clear&sounding better then the LP!!","Yes, this is the cd from Japan. It definitely is a much better sound then the USA out of print cd that sell for big bucks. Crisp and clear w/solid bass and much better mid & high frequencies all around. The cd does not come in the standard cd case, so you will have no problem finding it amoung all those standard cases. It does have a seperate sheet with the words and a full replica of the old LP cover. I would recommend purchasing this cd made in Japan before getting an out of print US reversion. I got this cd for only eight buck$ more then a mint LP, which I would have to put on a disk to listen to. Oh, you can pay alot less, for this cd, if you buy it on Amazon.com. Enjoy! (-:"
3,Okay Set for $5,"This is a weird set. I wonder if it's legitimate, as the films are given a 'public domain' release treatment, even though most are fairly new and must be copyrighted. 10 films, mostly from Miramax. They are on two disks. At five films per disk, you can imagine that the quality is pretty poor. The films are pixilated and are only worth watching on a smaller screen. Still, I picked it up for $5 and watched while I was on a sick day and it was fine for that. Not a bad selection: ""The Station Agent"" with Peter Dinklage, ""Comedian"" with Jerry Seinfeld and the late Greg Giraldo. ""Get Bruce"" is a fun documentary about comedy writer Bruce Vilanch. All in all, okay viewing copies. Just don't spend much more than $5. Bare bones DVD's with NO extras."
5,"Blistering, compelling rock","I bought this because I'd heard the opening track ""Down in the Desert"" and thought it excellent. I was stunned to find the whole CD is supreme...this is surely one of the best kept secrets in all of rock. Thin White Rope are a combination of Television and Sonic Youth and Nick Cave and Pavement and better than all of them. ""When Worlds Collide"" is one of my most treasured CDs and one of the greatest compilations in the history of rock music."
1,"I am yet to receive this book, first time I ever had a problem",I am disappointed that the book has not yet come. I have always used Amazon and never had a problem before. I assume the seller is to blame. My calls have produced no results
5,simply first-class!,"Truth be told, I wasn't expecting a whole lot of sophistication from the uneducated peasant culture of overwhelmingly rural Haiti. Imagine my surprise, then, to discover that I was being treated to a marvelously tightly integrated ethnographic study-cum-anecdote chrestomathy. In addition to some uniquely Haitian elements, there are, of course, the to-be-expected plethora of archetypal folkloric motifs as catalogued by Aarne and Thomson. The stories were generally brief and worked quite well, and Wolkstein's detailed notes about the physical setting and orator of each tale make the reader feel as if he's actually taking part in a rural Haitian storytelling session under the full moon in the sweltering sugar cane fields. Bravo, Dr. Wolkstein!"
1,Not Impressed,"Not to impressed that there is a picture of a girl on the cover, yet its a guy who is doing the teaching.The menu doesn't work! I can't bring up one specific dance routine to learn off of the menu, I can only hit""play all"" then fast forward to the routine I want to work on.Plus on the first dance he starts out doing the dance for like 3-4 minutes, then he teaches you the steps, then another minute of dance time... shouldn't he begin with teaching the steps, then go into an extended dance time?"
1,Rip Off,"First, the DVD was produced in Germany, and you have your choice of the instructor speaking in his native German or dubbed into English. Second, the German-language menu works, but the English-language menu does not. The only way to navigate through the English version is to either fast forward or keep jumping to the next chapter. Third, this is not for beginners. I'm a beginner and I should know."
3,Line Dancing for Grandkids,"My grandaughter and her friends are having a great time with this DVD and learing to line dance. It is very easy to follow, apparently, and we had a demonstration after the kids reviewed it a few times!"
4,Acquaintance Brings History to life !,"I recently had to read An Aqaintance ith darkness for a book report. When i was assigned the book i was not happy to have to read a boring cival war book. An Aquaintance must have been anything but boring. Emily Bransby Pigbush, a 14 year old girl lives in Washington D.C. until her mother dies. she is then sent to live with her Rich Uncle instead of her best friend. It turn out her Uncle who is a Doctor, gets people to body snatch people straight from the grave. The whole thing turns out all right. this is a great book to read if you are a fan of cival war hitory. I enjoyed every moment!"
4,Pretty Good,"I really liked this book! It is a Classic ""Rinaldi"". I really like Ann Rinaldi style of writing and it is filled with all sorts of excitement. One thing that was a bit different than most of her books is that is was sort of ""dark"". It is not a real ""happy"" book to read although it is very good."
3,This book will keep you on the edge of your seat!,"If you love mystery, then An Acquaintance with Darkness is the perfect book for you. This book not only puts you on the edge of your seat, but it also teaches you a little history lesson without the boring facts. I loved this book cause the author was soooo good at making history, in this case Lincoln's asassination, fun and interesting to read about by using fiction. I also liked the way the book had a little bit of everything, romance, mystery, horror, and anything else you could possibly think of. This book did have its slow molasses parts, but all in all I give Ann Rinaldi an A++! I hope she continues to write."
4,Diffrent.,"When I first picked up An Aquaintance With Darkness I thought it was going to be just another girl comming of age type historical novel. An Aquaintance With Darkness was so much more. This novel not only vividly described the turmoil in Washington surrounding the end of the American Civil War and the assasination of President Lincoln, but also brought up a pressing moral issue of that time: is it wrong to snatch bodies for medical research? It was interesting to read Emily's veiw point and see her inner struggle to sort out right from wrong. It was exciting to see the focus of the story change from a story of a girl growing up as an orphan to a story of a girl who must choose between what she beleives is right and being loyal to her family and friends. Over all I would say the book was a pleasent surprise."
2,An Aquaintance with Darkness,"Emily Bransbury's mom just died a week ago,her best friends mom was arrested for haelping the assasanation of Aberaham Lincoln. Now she needs to live with her Uncle Valentine. But when Emily finds out about his night life she puts her and her uncle in danger.My opinion is that it was to long for me. After a week of reading it I was sick of it. Plus it was way to slow.I wouldnt reccomend this book because in some spots its hard to tell whats happening. Plus it is long enough you may not want to read the end.I would say its a good book for book clubs. You could help each other with the confusing stuff, and with the words. For people my age i read it a long time in advance."
4,A Book you just can't put down!,"This book was one of Ann Ranildi's best. It is very emotinal, a some points I was so mad at the girl and a some points I was afraid. The book weaves 2 problums into one so ther's always something you have to look out for, and you don't know what charater to trust. The book takes a historal moment know one will forget and turns it into a book in the eyes of a 14 year old girl, who has no family left but her uncle that betrays her."
2,"Not one of Rinaldi's ""masterpiecies"", yet not so bad","Well, to be really honest with you, I didn't like this book. Personally, I though Ann Rinaldi could've done a little better. Some parts are interesting and maybe even suspensful, but the rest is kind of dull. At some points in the book, Emily, the main character, is lying so much to her Uncle Valentine and is being so selfish, it's like, ""okay, so when's she going to tell the truth or at least realize what she has done?"""
5,This book was Phnomenal,This was Ann's best book yet. The charatcters and the story were very well-written and woven into real history that I felt like i was relly there. The medical aspcet of it was interesting as well. I was also intrigued by all the body-snatchers and read more about them . The author presents a fair argument as to whether the bodies should have been left alone or used for mediacl science and I thought that her un-biased nature was commendable. This was a great book and I think this was definately the best yet.
4,"Good, but not her best","I liked this book, but some of her others were better. I was very surprised at the way doctors found there information at that time. I have never heard of grave robbing before this. This style of writing was different from how she usually writes. I also recommend one of her new ones, The Second Bend in the River."
5,A Very Suspenseful Book!,"This book not only kept me reading and reading, it also was suspenseful and thrilling. Emily was a truly wonderful character and all of the other characters had colorful personalities as well. If you like suspense and romance too, get this book today! You'll absolutely love it."
3,Sting - SACRED LOVE (2003),"Following his surprise ""comeback"" on 1999's BRAND NEW DAY, Sting disappeared for four years before releasing SACRED LOVE. Picking up on the success of guest musicians from the previous album (Farhat Bougallagui, Ste), Sting brought in Mary J. Blidge (""Whenever I Say Your Name""), Vincente Amigo (""Send Your Love""), and Anoushaka Shankar (""The Book Of My Life""), while venturing further into techno. The big problem with SACRED LOVE is that Sting seems to be focusing more on the sound of the music than the actual quality of the songs. This makes for an album that's a nice, moody listen, but lacks the punch of Sting's previous recordings. Though there's a wealth of enjoyable songs, only a few (the angry poke at George W. Bush on ""This War"", the sing-along tune ""Like A Beautiful Smile"") may be considered among Sting's best. In the end, though it's far from a bad album, SACRED LOVE is purely for Sting devotees."
4,RJ Kelly schlockmeister,Maxwell Rules particularly when he writes his own material.His new album is testimony to that! Fortunate has some extraordinary remixes and material every fan should own.Matrimony is beautiful but i was disappointed by the middle of the road title track penned by the tedious R.J kelley.
4,"very informative, hard to read","There was a lot of detail and information in this book, but not enough examples and the quantum mechanics section was not covered very well. probably since it would be beyond the scope of the book otherwise."
2,A Disappointment,"I am a professional player and teacher with students ranging from beginner to adult.First the good things: the book has songs that not represented on prior play-alongs, including ""Harlem Nocturne"" ,""Opus One"" and ""Bernie's Tune"". Plus, the players involved are quite good. This book could be useful for helping a beginner (to jazz) develop feel, at least in playing melodies.However, the flaws are pretty severe. Most songs have only 1 chorus of improvisation, some less. On ""Harlem Nocturne"" and ""Desafinado"", the solos are less than 12 bars TOTAL. Next, some arrangements are poor. ""A Night In Tunisia"" does not include the interlude before the break. ""Harlem Nocturne"" does not include the interval pattern at the end of the bridge.Again, this title might have a little value for a beginning jazz player to follow the melodies in an appropriate style. I can't recommend this to anyone else. There are better play-alongs out there."""
1,Poor!,I bought this to listen to a sax play better than me. No sax playing! Just a lame tone to follow along with.
3,Two stupid young people in love???,"This was both good and bad. It also could have been shorter. It dragged on too much, way too much.This man is a robber and inadvertenly tells this gal Bess, who he falls in love with. So she is now complicet in his robberies. It all goes terribly wrong for these two. It also has a terribly sad ending( The young lovers both die) and then there is this really dumb poem at the end of the book. Ugh!"
2,A story based on a song,"As soon as I had read the first few sentences of the review I immediately knew that the author had based this story on a song by Loreena McKennitt called ""The Highway Man"", from her 1997 CD ""Book of Secrets"". Since Ms. McKennitt is on of my favorite composers I had to read the book.Unfortunately the book did not do justice to the song or the woman who wrote the song. Did the author have permission to write this. I'm sorry but listening to the song is preferable."
4,Why not remix it?,"I love Yoko Kanno. I love Cowboy Bebop. I love the Seatbelts.The remixed versions of the songs are very listenable, I would carry this CD around to listen to as a pick-me-up. I actually think I have done that before.""Tank!"" Luke Vibert Mix is very poppy and jazzy and fun, I love this version so much. I brought this CD to a dance session in an acting class and this is what we danced to. Everyone loved it.""Forever Broke"" Fila Brazilia Mix is so beautiful! It's on a mix CD I made of all the Cowboy Bebop songs because it's good for chilling/meditation, dance, study, everything.""Piano Black"" was given a little more depth.Overall, it's a very listenable CD. If you're a diehard fan of Cowboy Bebop, you may not like what was done to some of the songs on here. It is an interesting fusion of styles."
3,Cowboy Bebop Fan,"This is a good cd, but don't listen to 'PLEASE READ' the music fan from Texas, this cd doesn't include Vitaminless. Either a friend burned them both on the same cd for him or the factory screwed up in his favor, or I was swindled. Regardless, this is a good cd, now I'm buying Vitaminless."
4,Works well,This kit has all the tools you'll need for a simple repair. The biggest issue is that the screws will get jumbled and are easy to lose (including under the plastic). Other than a little digging through for matches this kit has everything you need including hard to find matching screws!
3,"Love what's in the container, hate the container","The good news, this kit has almost everything you'd need to repair whatever sunglasses you need. The bad news, if you are even remotely clumsy like me, or don't have a totally steady hand? This case spills and mixes the contents up very easily. It's not the end of the world, and certainly more my fault than the actual product, but there's gotta be a better way to organize the pieces so they can be easily found if the box isn't always face up."
3,Nearly Perfect.,"I needed a kit to take on vacation in case my sunglasses had any issues. Sungalsses are pretty important on vacation (sunny) and it is not possible to replace expensive ones, nor should you have to. We all hate when those little screws come out and it is really hard to find them. Now if it happens, I am prepared. It has a variety of things and after checking I can see it has what I would need. Lots of different sizes and more than just screws. I feel confident with this purchase but the case should be a little more sturdy, seems like it can crack easy and the can update the contents to be more contemporary. Overall good product. This seemed to be the best one for the price for what I was looking for."
2,okay,"the keychain is useful and works good, so if you are getting this to tighten up your glasses, its great. but i bought it to replace a cushion on my glasses. the screws are so small you can barely hold them in your fingers let alone secure it in place to try to screw it in,even with someone else helping me. you are better off getting your glasses repaired in a shop. but i do like the keychain."
5,Outstanding performancw,"I'd like to see this on stage, this performance certainly enhanced my interest in this work."
2,Typical Imported Product,"The case is pretty much useless. Nothing stays in the small compartments. I really dont know why they exist. The small screwdriver, both flathead & phillips are cheap material. You cant magnetize it in order to hold the screws which would make all the difference considering the size of the screws."
4,Handy,Although handy the box could have a better way to hold in place all the useful screws. Overall it is great purchase.
4,Not bad,"Kit has a lot if parts. Some are great for certain glasses, others are too small. Would be great if half the kit was full of larger screws."
5,Just right for the job,This repair kit has an excellent selection of lots of various screw sizes and had just what I wanted for my glasses. The cost was not expensive and delivery was fast. I have to use a walker or scooter so going to the store to fix my glasses would have been a big chore. This kit enabled me to do everything at home quickly.
5,Great product,This kit has everything you would ever need to repair a pair of glasses from screws to nose padsI received the kit real fast in about 3 days I was surprised at how many screws there were the screwdriver is easy to use and the nose pads so many this was better then described on amazon store page
5,Great Tool Kit for Sunglasses,"After my Gucci sunglasses lost the part that holds the screw I could not find a tool kit that coantain the part and I didn't want to throw my glasses away. I am so glad I found this kit in Amazon. Not only did it have the part I need it, it also has a small screw that attaches to your keychain so you can have with you at all times just in case your sunglasses get loose."
3,Almost there,"the kit was purchased because I needed a set of screws. Unfortunately, they were not in the kit! 70 different screws and not the ones that I needed. I think this will be useful if I ever loose another screw but this was just not quite there for me."
3,99.8% screws and 0.2% nuts,"All I wanted was nuts, not screws but all I got was screws and not enough nuts :-)Most repair kits out there, they all seem to provide screws, not nuts. Wonder why?For each screw, you need a nut to tighten it, so why restrict the repair kit to only 2 nuts and 40 screws ??Got the 1 nut that I wanted and the price of this kit paid for itself, i.e. a trip to the repair shop - gas, and 1 hr drive time and paying $5 to the optician for repair.Wish it had many more nuts in it. That seems to be the only thing I ever lose in the pairs I have."
3,screws too small,I bought this kit because several of my sunglasses have lost screws so I just keep buying new ones and wasting my money. I was very disappointed to find out that after I bought this kit NONE of the screws fit in my sunglasses! They were all too small. I'm sad. Now I have to buy some more sunglasses!
1,Doesn't smell like plumeria...unusable,"This product smells disgusting, not like plumeria products I have bought. If you like plumeria, do not buy ... ... ... ..."
4,Motivating,"This video is a great way to get in shape, practice your self defense skills and gaze at gorgeous Lorenzo Lamas while you do it. It does help if you've previously taken self defense classes though."
2,Fox Collection,The Great Fox War Movies (Patton - Special Edition / The Longest Day / Tora! Tora! Tora! - Special Edition)I purchased this set and the DVD's (6) Were Damaged. I requested a replacement. The Replacement was also damaged. The problem is the DVD's are in paper inserts in the Book. They are not protected. In the packaging process by FOX ( Not Amazon ) The DVD's get all scratched and will not play.
3,not bad but more variety in charts utilized would help,"not for the faint of heart casual reader if you like Stats and Statistics then this may well be the book of your dreams otherwise could be a smidge tedious and heavy to the ""weekend"" reader."
2,Not the best choice...,"Was received promptly, but the quality of the item is rather shoddy, barely lasted a week. Not the sellers fault but still to be noted."
5,The Best of Bizarro is awesome,"Well, this is a great collection. The artwork is great, but it's the clever conceptions that make these cartoons so funny. There are no stock characters or favorite themes, every panel is original and fresh. Highly recommended."
4,Comprehensive guide to ski touring in the Tahoe ares.,"My copy of this book is nearly destroyed from all the use it receives. This book is not just for winter. Many of the tours described have also turned out to be excellent mountain bike routes and hiking trips. The descriptions of the areas the routes traverse could be expanded, but the route information itself is first class."
4,Bearded bonus,"I have a real beard and play Santa. Grandson is almost 2, and has a problem with beards. This gave him a chance to put on/take off the beard, and made Christmas much nicer!"
3,Europe Atlas,"The maps are great, but it is hard to figure out which country you are looking at. I was hoping that each country would be covered on a double facing page. Was surprised when I got it because it was like one huge map cut into over 100 pages."
2,A disappointment,"This is not a good atlas at all. Maps are small and you can't find many of the cities, let alone small towns in europe, at least in southeastern europe. Waste of money."
4,Really good value for the money,"I needed a wireless card for my desktop PC as it was moving to another room and I don't currently have the time to run a coaxial connection in there for the cable modem.I picked this card based on the rating and reviews here. I am happy to say that they were very accurate and this is a really good card, especially given that the price is so low compared to other, brand name cards.Installation was very simple and the signal strength and speed are perfect. I was in a hurry so I just used the Windows wireless client instead of the dedicated, included software but perhaps if I get time later, I will try running that.All in all, you simply can't go wrong with this card - right price and very good performance."
5,Why pay more?,"I actually purchased a pair of these about a year ago for my home WIFI network from a different site. Since that site no longer has these in stock, I got the next pair (this time for my church) from Amazon. I have had 0 issues with these cards - can't remember a single time where I lost connectivity honestly. Don't think I could ask for more, especially at the price point. Great buy!"
4,"It works quite well,","The product is excellent. I was getting dropped signals with both of my other wireless adapters, one from Netgear and one from Zonet. This always has excellent signal strength and does not drop the signal.The four stars instead of five is because the instructions are incomprehensible. It gives the feeling they were written by people who did not understand English very well. I wanted to turn on encryption, but have no idea how to do it even after struggling with the poorly written directions. I can turn on encryption for one session, but as soon as I disconnect, it cannot reconnect unless I turn encryption off... Oh, well, it is fine as long as I don't try to mess around with it."
5,Super G 802.11BG Wireless Pci 64 Bit Xp Compliant Turbo Mode,"I ordered this just over a month ago, and I recieved it in the time frame that I was told. It is great! My computer works great with it and it was really easy to install! I have never installed one before, but I wanted to try and do it myself and not have to get someone else to do it! It was so easy to do and once installed, I downloaded the disk and it was ready to go...it was really quite simple,and I am far from a computer expert. So if I can do it, so can you! I'm so glad I got it and I will probably be purchasing a couple more in the near future for my kids' computers too!!"
3,easy install,"easy install, quick setup. No problems. If you are putting it anywhere near 50 feet than you should be ok.. That is if you have framed walls and not 2 foot thick concrete walls like me. Even with thick walls I still manage to get a ok signal."
4,Works great,"I was worried about buying a cheaper card for my desktop, but that has since subsided. This works great.It was easy to set up. I have 100% signal strength from my router that is one floor down and one room over. I have had no dropped signal problems either. Why not buy this one that is cheaper than a more expensive one?"
2,Weak Signal,"I purchased this because of the good reviews.. but I didn't have a good experience. Putting the card in was easy enough... but once I got it in, the signal was 14% ... so I thought... ok.. we are 2 floors away... maybe it's not close enough. So I moved it to the room 10 feet away from the wireless router.. and I still only got 14% and it kept dropping connection. I messed with the settings for several hours and couldn't get any better connection. Uninstalled, returned to Amazon at their expense for a prompt refund.. and purchase the WRT54G. I get over 80% with that!"
1,did not work,The card did not work. Customer service did not respond. The attenna did help boost the linksys card I ended up installing.
5,Installed on 2 desktops - Easy as pie,"I wanted to get rid of those pesky wires, so after some research I bought one of these to see if it would work in my desktop. The day it arrived I followed the directions and it was picking up my wireless router signal within 5 minutes of opening the package. Needless to say, I bought another one the same day for my wife's desktop and they have worked flawlessly for a month now. Both are XP systems."
4,Great card but win7 users be wary,"I recently purchased this card for a new build. The card worked great at first with the MSI drivers but a few days afterwards I kept getting horrible connection issues. I'd stay connected but webpages would take forever to load and when in WoW I would get lag (people running in place) and disconnects. After reading reviews I tried ralink drivers RT61. These drivers worked great with connectivity but then, every once in a while, caused me to lose total connection followed by a BSOD (blue screen). After dealing with the BSODs I found out that this card runs off the Ralink RT2561 chip, went to Ralink's site and used their updated drivers...everything works fine now.summary:1) use Ralink RT2561 drivers.2) enjoy"
4,The hardware works. The included software doesn't!,"Got this card today (06/30/09). Added the card in my Dell Dimension desktop running windows XP, and installed the driver from the CD that came with it and it didn't work! It detected my wireless router but when I entered the WEP key, it just wouldn't connect. Went to the MSI site found the driver for this product and boom it works. Signal strength is excellent.Included driver version is some 1.X and the version on the MSI site is 3.1. On the MSI site under download section search for PC60G and you will find the right driver.How difficult is it to include the right driver with a new product?! Hence the 4 stars, otherwise I would have given 5."
1,Incompatible with windows7,"OK, I bought this card after reading all the nice reviews, but in fact, it sucks. The official website doesn't have a driver for windows 7. It took me hours to find a driver from its chip manufactur. Now the computer finally recognized the card and can be connected to the router, but 80% of the time, the only thing you see when opening up a browswer is ""server not found"". It's on its way back to amazon. If you are eager to try out windows 7 when it's out, avoid this card as best as you can."
2,antenna sucks! I recommend a more modern antenna!,"okay, first of all it works, but the thing is that the antenna it comes with is sort of short, i mounted it to the top of my case, but it just looks sketchy.Secondly, the antenna broke on me today, and if you dont have the antenna connected to the pci screw in-no wireless... the screw in (with the little black tape that goes around the wire) is very sensitive almost to the point where its unfair. and like i said, no antenna no connection. my antenna broke off at the base and it makes the wireless pci care useless.And lastly, like i mentioned before the antenna looks like something out of the 80's with a little cliche tabletop design, but i just mounted it to the top of my case, and it still gets in the way when i take my case out to work on it.Im sure that this wireless card works fine connectivity and signal and all that, but once your antenna breaks its all over- NO MORE CONNECTION"
1,Not Worth It,This product constantly connects and disconnects every two seconds. I have an HP and the connector plates don't line up either. Every two seconds the included program refreshes the network list and connects and disconnects. It does not work.
1,Doesn't work,This product will come up with the networks in the area. If you put in the network pass key it will connect then immediately disconnect. I bought it because I don't have alot of money and I wanted to get a wireless adapter cheap. Don't buy. Fork out the extra money on a better adapter.
4,"Functional, Reliable, Inexpensive","The sturdy, extended antenna is a big plus. I do wish the extension was longer though. It's only about 18in. It does make a difference where I place it. Books seem to be more disruptive than walls.I am using this on my HTPC (which sits on a bookshelf) with the wireless router about 50 ft away through 2 walls. I'm always getting at least normal ""yellow"" strength. Mostly ""green"" though.I have XP Pro 64. WPA was fairly easy to setup and the supplied software is pretty intuitive.If you're having problems setting up security though, don't expect much help from the book.Overall a great, inexpensive product. For the price, it could have gotten 5 stars, but I'm picky."
1,crc receive errors,"Installation was relatively simple, but the receiver seemed not sensitive enough for the location.After successfully connecting a mac mini with airport at the same location, I was convinced that the problem was the adapter. I installed another adapter , linksys, that worked immediately. Perhaps the super G will work in locations with clear line of site access, but it was not strong enough for my environment. I had to spend the extra money to get a working solution."
5,Works great if.................,"I recently installed this card on an old HP 64 bit desktop that I was upgrading to Windows 7. As the included CD didn't have a Windows 7 driver I went to their website, using another PC of course, and downloaded the correct driver and then let Windows ""find"" it during installation. I didn't load any of the manufacturer's software at all, I let Windows do everything and its working perfectly. I get instant connection when I power up, the signal is strong and I've yet to drop the connection. The desktop is 2 rooms (thus 2 walls) away from the gateway and directly next to an HD TV, which I use as its monitor, and doesn't pick up any interference. Oh, one more thing, once everything was working ""automatic update"" downloaded and installed an even newer driver."
4,Does not come with windows7 drivers,"If you are buying this card for a windows 7 build you will have to look for drivers online other than that the card works fine. I'm playing online games like CSS on steam and others and it gives me no lag, our wireless modem is two rooms away and I'm getting 4 out of 5 bars which is good but not perfect. I wish they updated the drivers for MAC or hackintosh as some of you might know what that is. The latest drivers for their web side are from 08 for 10.5.x version. No snow leopard support what so ever."
5,"Easy install, works great",I moved to a location where wireless internet was all that was available and so I needed a wireless adapter for my desktop PC. This product was quick and easy to install and enabled me to be on line immediately. The price was very reasonable and the product works as described.
5,Great wireless adapter,"The computer I installed this in, is in my sons room across the hallway. Without a wall, it would measure probably 50 to 60 feet (maybe a little more) Since I have installed the product it has held at excellent signal. I can't say how well it would work further as I have not tried. I only ran into 1 hiccup after installing. When I turned off the computer and turned it back on, it did not automatically hunt for my access point. So I added my access point to the settings and that fixed that problem. I am very pleased with this product."
3,THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 7,"REPEAT This will not work with windows 7There are no patches, I called the manufacturer. It may work if you has VISTA and upgrade to 7 ( I have not tried this) BUT NOT when being installed directly to 7.I used it on my VISTA before it crashed and it worked great. BUT NOT Dwith a new install TO 7."
4,"Great product, great price","I had no issues during installation and setup, so it's a true plug & play item. The cord for the antenna was a bit short though."
5,Super G 802.11BG worked out of box,"I installed the Super G 801.11BG wireless card into an older Dell desktop with 2 OS's on separate hard drives. One OS is ubuntu and the other is XP.With the ubuntu OS,the card worked out of the box without any more tweaking,with the XP OS,I installed the software that came with the card,and it worked without any more tweaking, and still works with ubuntu after upgrading from 8.10 to 9.04.Highly recommend this wireless card and I really like the antenna being on a cable instead of attached to the card on the back of computer."
4,Works great!,"I had a wireless USB adapter, and it does not compare to this! Easy to install and hasn't dropped signal on me yet"
4,Good starter WI-FI for desktop,"I purchased this to allow my daughter to access the household wireless network. I bought it based on prior reviews and price. (It was to go into a 5 year old desktop that my daughter inherited when we upgraded). It is a Super G and works like a champ on our enhanced N network, even though a bit slow, (but that could be the old computer). I would highly recommend this product for adding onto an existing network and for added flexibility on desktop placement. This one went upstairs no where near any existing LAN cables."
4,"Great, inexpensive, easy to use","The PCI card dropped in, the software worked, and things were online. It is exactly what I was looking for."
3,Does not work for Vista 64,"Some have said this works on Vista 64 (after downloading a driver from the company website), but it did not work for me. Tried many things, but at the end, returned to amazon and got a different USB card (LInksys WUSB600N) that is certified to work on vista64. Life is all good again."
4,Works great,I added this to my windows vista desktop. It seems to work fine. I have been using it for months.
2,lost settings,"Works great most of the time. BUT, keeps losing settings thus my internet drops. I have to reinstall drivers every couple of days."
3,not so good wireless card,The card is not compatible with Windows XP unless you download a path for it. It is not that easy to configure and you cannot use the software included in the box to connect to a wireless router. I did get it to work but it was not an easy task.
4,Not a bad product.,Good but sometime I had to reboot my computer to get it connected with wireless router.
2,"Works, but with limitations.","This PCI card is easy to install, and so is the software. The interface of the software is also good. However, the cable connecting the antenna and the card is too short, making it difficult and often impossible to find a good location for the antenna to have stable strong signal. This is especially true if the PC is located under a desk. The cable is too short for the antenna to reach the desk. My desk has metal legs, which may interfere with the wireless signals. I used this card for a year and was often irritated by the need for tweaking the position of antenna to get stable signal. Since PCs are not to be moved around, if possible, installing a network cable will be a far better solution than wireless. I finally bought an RJ45 crimper, connectors, and cat5e bulk cable (for about $80 total) to connect several rooms to my router. I wish I had done this at the beginning to save the money on this card."
4,"Hardware good, software bad","The card works fine, but the included configuration utility repeatedly dropped my wireless connection. I started using the Windows XP configuration utility, and it holds the connection much better."
3,works well in 64bit Win7 when you find the driver,"I spent several hours trying to install this card into a new computer build that has a windows 7 64 bit OS.First I found out that the 64bit Vista drivers from MSI's website wouldn't work. (and as of 11/03/09 I still don't see any windows 7 drivers for either 32bit or 64 bit) But then I found out that the chip manufacturer for the board has a ""generic"" 64 bit driver. The company is called Ralink. Look for the RT256x chip driver on ralink's website. (I would post the link, but amazon appears to remove it if you do) Once you download and install it, the card will work quite well in Windows 7 (don't forget to uninstall the MSI driver first).So overall the card is pretty decent. I get good connection speeds and it reliably links up every time I power on the computer. But the driver for windows 7 just doesn't appear to be available yet. So I give it an overall rating of 3."
2,"Lots of Basset photos, short on Basset specifics.","I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset. I enjoyed the MANY photos of Bassets, but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in ANY general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff. It looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed-specific details and lots of photos and -- presto! -- a new book.Less than 30 pages (of 224) are specific to Bassets."

5,Wonderful Resource,"The stories in ""The Mishomis Book"" give an excellent background for the Anishnabe culture. I have heard Anishnabe Elders refer to it as a children's bible for the Anishnabe.It begins with the origin of the Anishnabe People. It continues through many of the stories that establish the mores and society of this culture. All of these stories are written in a way children can understand.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the culture of the Woodland Indians. It has been a beginning point of understanding this culture for me and, I am certain, many others."
5,Wonderful story,"I had to buy this for a college course, and I love it so much that I won't part with it now. My kids are reading it and I think it's a great way to introduce them to Native American tradition."
1,Waste of money,"This program does have some good hiking information but it is not very user friendly at all. The maps are the worst part of it, you can either look at a small general state map or zoom to a trail map NOTHING in-between. If you want to find trails (and don't know the trail name) you have to guess on the state which only lists major cities. All you can do is click on the small state map and hope it is near the town you are looking for. If you know the trail name then it is OK. My advice is save your money and use the internet because there are many hiking web sites that have the same or more trail information and are a lot easier to use."
4,Decent entry level receiver,"I've had this receiver for a couple of years, I guess.It still works flawlessly, as did it's Pioneer predecessorbefore it developed a hum in one channel.It has plenty of inputs and outputs. I'm happy that ithas digital audio (fiber optic) input as the only soundoutput my brand new LG TV has is a digital audio.The remote can be a bit fiddly and, like many otherproducts produced abroad, has a less than understandableuser manual. I waded my way through it, and my systemsounds good, but understanding all of the features byreading about them in the manual is difficult.I would certainly consider replacing this receiverwith another Pioneer product. I've used them for yearswith few problems."
4,DONT BUY FROM AMAZON!!!,this is a good reciver but i got it at circuit city for 120. i live in california so im not sure if they have circuit city's anywhere else.
5,Classic and Essential!,"Since 1980, I have been recommending this reference to over 23, 000 participants in my business writing workshops. I describe the book as invaluable, comprehensive, beautifully organized, and continuously updated. The Gregg Reference Manual is one of two essential tools for business, government and corporate writers: the other is a fat dictionary. The Manual is full of wisdom and articulates sound uniform rules with nicely nuanced exceptions. It is simply my writer's crutch."
5,Complete and easy to use,"I've used this book for years, and I think it's terrific. Why? Four reasons: First, the information about grammar and usage is so mainstream, so consistent with the majority of other important references (The Chicago Manual of Style, for one). Second, it is accurate and reliable. Third, the outstanding index makes it wonderfully easy to use; you can look something up, in everyday terms, and readily find a reference. Fourth, the rules are short and the examples clear; once you've found the rule you need, you can read it, grasp it, and 30 seconds later be on your way.As a full-time trainer of writers and editors, I have used this book with everyone from grammar-challenged support staff to highly educated professional editors. With some classes, I've also used the optional worksheets (sold separately). I can't recommend Gregg highly enough."
3,"A good everyday reference tool, but...","This manual is a great tool with easy to locate information and a wealth of information; it is not, however, the end-all of writing. It is a good business writing manual, but to an English student and editor, it falls rather short. For example, Sabin's advice on generic pronouns and gender may suit a business proposal with ""his or hers"" and ""he or she"" littering the page, but in the humanities, this is becoming less and less acceptable. Items such as this seem unimportant only until you need them.The GRM is a fine grammar manual if needed only for occasional use casually and in business situations, but for intense scrutiny, it wouldn't be my first choice."
4,Math made easy,This product was just how I remembered it when I used it 30 years ago. Yes the answers are hard to see until you press down real hard. But that is how it was 30 years ago and I did not expect anything different. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to teach their kids addition and subtraction.My children look at it like a computer and love playing with it. It gives them instant answers when they press down and they like that satisfaction.
3,Hard to see numbers.,"I had one like this as a kid and it was very helpful. I bought one for my son and daughter. They don't seem as interested, but the numbers are a little hard to see when you push the buttons. I guess it could be because I'm getting older!They have used it for reference on occasion, but not really wanting to use it for the memorization."
2,Hard to see answers under buttons,I bought this for my oldest son because he is interested in learning addition and subtraction. He has only used it four or five times. He gets frustrated that his finger covers the answer and the plastic is so thick it is hard to read anyway. I remember using this toy when I was young and I thought the manufacturers would have developed a better product since materials have changed so much in the past twenty years.
3,Could be better,The answers are difficult to see when you press the buttons. It is a good learning tool and I would still recommend it.
2,ONLY FOR PROGRAMMER,I got this book for my programming class and I had no programming experience before. I hate this book! Maybe some people who have a little background would like it better.
2,Vague,"This is not a good Java book. It goes too fast over topics that should be covered in more depth, lacks examples, mentions concepts never explained before, and the teaching style is horrible. If you want a thorough introduction to Java, with plenty of examples, and a well-organized method of teaching, do not buy this book, instead get ""Beginning Java 2"" by Ivor Horton. ""Just Java"" seems like was written to simply let you know that the language exists and it has this and this feature, but it doesn't teach how to use them. I don't even see it as being a good reference book. The 5-star reviewers must have been paid to give such good comments on this book."
1,Lacks depth.,"This book does not treat any topic in detail. If you just want to skim through Java concepts at 10,000 feet this is the correct book for you. The print is very sparse with lots of not very useful (rather large) images.I got mis-guided by all those 5-Star reviewes."
1,Not Practical,"This book leaves much to be desired. Take the chapter called ""All About Applets"" for example. It briefly covers how browser and applets interact, parameter passing, key applet methods, and jar files, but it does not put together a cohesive, clear, practical example in the whole chapter. The best example they have is displaying a jpeg file extracted from a jar file. When am I ever going use that? Try putting together an useful applet for your web page from reading that chapter -- I know I couldn't. Fragmentation and lack of good examples occur through much of the book.Don't be fooled. This book had a 4 1/2 star rating this book had when I ordered it (with many reviews), and it's definitely not deserving of the 4 star rating it has now."
3,"Not for beginners in OO technology , Java",This book may be good for people with prior expereince in any OO language. I had bought it after seeing the review that it is very good for people who start from scratch. Definitely it is not. Also it has many unwanted lines taking digs at other languages and some dry humour. The examples given also are cryptic and will be difficult to be understood by beginners. The only place in which it scores over other books may be that it has gone deep into many aspects of the language that are useful.
2,Its little hard..,The way he used to explain the topics are confusing..I was very excited to buy this book but found it difficult instead of having C and C++ knowledge.
2,NOT so good,"Not a very good book to learn Java. I found that the book doesn't organized very well, and you will still get confused if you are a beginner even after you read the book throughly."
4,Just Java 2,"Excellent book, especially for those who have some knowledge of Java.I found the way the author explains topics very thrilling. He makes topics that had previously seemed very hard, such as RMI, appear very simple. The book is also illustrative and leisurely. The examples are simple and easy to follow."
5,"Thank you, Peter! Your book is great!","I've found this book totally different from any other tutorial stuff. In spite of my past programmers expirience in database I've started studying OOP from scratch more than one year ago. I had several books of Java-programming (Deitel&Deitel, Mike Morgan, Peter Norton etc.). I've got prefer this one. Author give to readers the pretty excelent refferences. I would say that this book ought to read whether you beginers in OOP or not. This book will compel you work. It is inexhaustible source for Java programming."
4,Good transition book,"As an experienced C/C++ programmer, I wanted a book that could fairly quickly get me up speed in Java. I'd say that this book met that challenge. Though it's 700+ pages may seem a bit daunting at first, it was an easy read for myself.To finish my first Java project, I had to rely on on-line help and a few other books, so don't expect this to be the only Java book you read. But as a start for an experienced programmer it's quite adequate."
2,Not a very thorough book,"This book has some excellent reviews. As a student that has studied a few other languages, including OOP languages, I felt that this was the least helpful of all starting books that I've picked up. The code examples do not give you any inkling of how a real Java program may be used. The features of the Java language are introduced without explaining why they are needed and how they are actually used in real programs. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would like a clear example of the Java language."
1,Don't buy this book unless you already know JAVA,"The reviews here are deceiving. Trust me. Unless you have already read another book on Java, you will have a hard time understanding it. The examples are fragmented and never complete. The author assumes that you know Java already and did not even bother to provide examples for many of the concepts. This may be a good book for intermediate level JAVA programmers, but it is definitely not for beginners. If I didn't know C++ at all, I would have thrown this book into the trash can the first day I read it. This ranks up there as one of the worst programming books I've ever read, a total waste of my hard-earned money. Thanks to the deceiving reviews, I now need to spend more money to get a real beginner JAVA book."
2,very cryptic details,not suited for beginner's should have qiute lucid explationsi dont recommend for new commers to java
3,Not that great,"Coming from C/C++ and Perl, I understood the book fine. And as long as the author sticks to the technical aspects of Java, he does alright, I guess. But he makes many inaccurate statements about C and Perl, in my opinion, while making Java out to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. I'm keeping the book, at least for now, as a reference, but I'm learning Java from better books, viz, Eckel's Thinking in Java, and publisher Addison Wesley's The Java Tutorial."
5,"Great book, great price","I learned a lot from ""Just Java 1.2"" and really liked the readable style. The author knows how to get detailed technical points across. The diagrams and pictures really helped too. The CD has a LOT of Java material on it."
2,"Easy to read, but NOT a good reference","Just Java 2 is very readable, but it does not do a very good job of teaching Java or OOP. I'd read a chapter and feel like I had a fairly complete understanding. But when I tried to apply what I learned, I always struggled. The problem for me was his examples are way too fragmented and incomplete. I spend lots of time reviewing FAQ sites for descent examples.I would not recommend this book.FYI - I am new to OOP, but relatively experienced with C, ADA, Fortran, ..."
2,Cheaply made,Cheaply made and difficult for little hands to slide peek a boo parts. Wouldn't but it again. Not manufactured well-it looked old after just a few minutes of handling.
3,They irritate my ear canals,"These are foam earplugs, and you roll/squeeze them with your fingers, then stuff them into your ears where they expand to fill the ear canal. They stay in pretty well and are simple to use, but they feel scratchy to me and not terribly effective. I greatly prefer the silicone earplugs called ""Mack's Ear Pillows"". They are more comfortable and block out sound better."
4,Not Bad at All,"As far as filler arcs go, this isn't bad at all. The only thing bad about it is that it's keeping you from the actual main story. For what it is it's alright, I enjoyed watching it. The picture quality is as good as ever, same goes for the English dub. If you've been collecting these sets don't stop now!"
3,pretty good; requires some self-motivation,"if you're serious about wanting to learn a language, this is good starter stuff to learn how to speak. but it's not going to grab your hand and make you use it, and it's not as engaging as, say, grand theft auto vice city. (the ""game"" cd, oscar lake, is pretty lame.)i own this and enjoy it, but i wouldn't recommend it for the casual student. i've taken real french classes and am not sure i'd recommend this to someone brand new to the langauge. bonne chance!"
1,Worthless,It should have got 0 rating. You could buy a English-French dictionary instead of buying this. This does not 'teach' you anything. Do not spend your heard earned money on this
5,Great for bi-wire,"I use this on my Mirage OMD -15 , since the speaker has 4 post on the speaker and suggest bi-wiring I needed something that would be able to be run into the same plug into the receiver and all four plugs into the speaker while not splitting the wire. Even though I am not running over long distances I like the fact that I can run 4 16 gauge AWG solid copper wires out of 2 plugs."
1,Next time read the item description Edgardo,"This is not a book so much as a bunch of quotes made by Tozer, put together in a way to look pretty and make the publisher some $$ off people like me who love Tozer's works. There is nothing of value here. Read the Pursuit of God by Tozer if you you want something to challenge you and guide you, not this."
5,Reviewing the review,"I am bothered by the review from dn@microtek.fr. Everyone has a right to his own opinion, but I think this is just vicious anti-Christian retoric. Mr. Tozer is a prolific writer and has several 5 star ratings. Please see the ""All Books"" list before judging this book only by what this man says."
4,Cool!,It is a very good CD! My favorite songs were the ones that people sang.. I am kind of disapoined because I thought the charcters will sings their charcter themes... it was more backround music tho.. very Classical-ish! But a good CD!! 4/31 were sung.. :*( I wish more of them were sung!
4,A Fine Enough Book.,This book does a good job of motivating me to keep to my cardio kickboxing class. Even if there are more other good books on martial arts kicking in print. I collect such kind of books. Keep up the good work.
3,for the collecting kicking enthusiast,"Chung and Rothrock are legends. Great martial artists with duly earned fame. Their book is a beautiful presentation of the most aesthetic of kicks, therefore underscoring form and high kicking. It is also tilted in my opinion towards the Korean interpretation of kicking where aesthetics and flexibility are kings. This book is nice and I think a must have for the collecting kicking enthusiast. I do not consider it a reference work, because much too eclectic and not really practical."
1,baaaaaadddddddd bookkkkkkk,"por favor no gaste su dinero en este pesimo y mediocre libro,,lo unico que la mujer y el chino hacen es mostrar su impresionante flexibilidad,pero nada mas,,no aportan tecnicas reales ni explicaciones para llegar a ese estado.me parece mas bien que los autores lo que quieren es que la gente sepa que ellos tienen una super-flexibilidad impresionante.este es solamente un librito y nada mas,, muy,,muy pero muy mediocre"
4,Momentum watch,Everything was thought of luminescent dial large enough numbers and a good looking watch at a reasonable price extremely functional
3,Not comprehensive nor essential,"This is not a particularly good collection of the 1970s punk-pop band's best work. The tracks are not arranged chronologically and some of the greatest hits are missing, like Call Me, Heart Of Glass and Sunday Girl. There are far better compilations in the form ofThe Complete Picture: Very Best of Blondie,The Platinum CollectionandGreatest Hits. The one great thing about this CD is it's stylish cover."
1,not sufficient after a long day at the computer,I am a writer and have to work 8 hours straight at a keyboard for clients when on tight deadlines. It was suggested by a specialist that I ice my wrists every night. I thought this would be a neat way to do it. The concept is good but the beads never get cold enough to accomplish the therapy and subsequent relief needed.
4,Better,I read an bridged copy of this book when I was just a boy. It was a good book then. I decieded that I would reread this book. I was surpised that not much was taken out. It was still a good book. I am looking into getting more Holmes' books.
1,"Missing content is not acceptable - Wake up, Amazon!","Missing content is not acceptable for publishing books, either paper version or digital version! Please fix the problem, Amazon!!!!"
1,Missing Content,this book is missing parts from chapter 2. You can read the missing contents for free on wikipedia.
4,Excellent Read!,"When I read the back of the book, I thought this was going to be a fantasy novel. It turns out, while the story is fictional, it could very well be a true story and not far-fetched at all. The characters are slightly confusing, and the middle tends to lag on a bit, but overall, it was a nice read. It's not one of those one-sitter books, but if you have a lot of time on your hands and would like to read an anticipating novel, The Hound of the Baskervilles is a great pick. :)"
5,The Best Sherlock Holmes -- And That's Saying Plenty!,"I have read and enjoyed many a good Sherlock Holmes story (e.g. ""The Red-Headed League"" is a winner), but at the very top of the book stack I would place ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"". Who could ever forget the atmosphere that Arthur Conan Doyle evokes by his use of those misty moors!In teaching English (Literature) to a class of 7th & 8th grade boys, I was at first a bit hesitant to introduce this novel as our text. Would a group of squirrelly junior high boys find anything of interest in a book written in 1901? Answer: I needn't have worried. They loved it (and so did I)! The fog from the moors drifted right into our classroom.First-rate mystery tale with one of the most famous fictional characters ever created. ENJOY! (But keep an eye out for a frightful luminescent hound next time you're walking home at night - just in case)."
4,chris's review,"this was one of shelocks best books. this book was suspenceful,exicting, mysterious and shocking. in this book all kind of things happen,i mean think about it ok, your in 1814 and your dad has been atacked by a ""hell hound"" so you think his son has just enherited his mancion and his money. she he calls sherlock holmes to find out what happend to his father, and as he gets to start looking around the place he finds that the father had another son but did not knew about it. this son was even living on the property, and this son was the killer becuse he whanted to have the manchion. the conflict is great, we have person vs.person, person vs.nature, person vs.animal. this was a great book just to read, allways had surprises and suspence, it was a great mystery.it was a great thing to see that the hound was only a starved animal."
5,Top Rate Holmes..........,"Ah, to settle in with Hound of the Baskervilles was pure delight. I had read this many years ago in an almost obsessive pursuit of reading all things Sherlock Holmes and have only recently taken up my obsession again with the wonderful series by Laurie R. King featuring Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell. I digress, back to Hound of the Baskervilles. One of the best mysteries in the series. What more could you ask for? A spookylegend about a gruesome phantom dog, murder most foul, the English moor and an ancient creepy mansion. In this story, Dr. Watson has never been more delightful as Holmes' foil and confidant. The mystery evolves to an exiting climax which leaves the reader fufilled but wanting to get their hands on the next Holmes case. Well done!"
2,Missing substantial passages on Kindle version,"I would give this Sherlock Holmes story 5 stars, the low rating is due to the poor Kindle formatting. I know it is free but there are substantial passages missing... parts that are very important to the story... such as the actual legend of the Hound of the Baskerville. If you are truly interested in reading this story, there is a version that is only $1 to download and is complete."
2,The Hound of the Baskervilles MP's story!!!,I liked the book because I like murder mysteries and if you like that kinda stuff this is a book for you! But it gets boring because you have like 14 pages a chapter basically about noghting. Also I like this book because it's got non-other than Shelock Holmes the greatest detective in book history.In the beginning it does get intresting. But like I said before 14 or more pages in a chapter. Trying to find out the mystery is the best part.I'll pick characters because the characters are weird. The cool ones are Sherlcok Holmes and Dr. Watson. But then you get weird ones that Sherlock Holmes thinks are the suspects. But he also follows them and decides if he thinks they murdered the person or not? Setting is next the setting is in London. They make it sound really scary where they are at Baskerville Hall where the heir of Sir Charles Basketville who died left to his nephew.
2,Paranormal forces in my mystery?,"I expected to find it a little dry, but overall likeable. Instead, I found the story a little too far to the supernatural, and Sherlock Holmes turned out to be one of the most unlikable characters I've read in a long time! I really felt for Watson, who did not come across as the dumb, stumbling sidekick. I had a hard time slogging through the book, and it didn't make me want to pick up any more Holmes anytime soon. I guess I expected a little more ""Basil of Baker Street"" from The Great Mouse Detective."
2,Hard to read,This was the first book I have ever read by Arthur Conan Doyle. I would not recomend reading the book. I found it very dry and hard to read. He uses textbook-like discription and his 1850's English language conflicts with the 2000's american language. The first 50 pages are rather boring and unimportant to the rest of the story. The book only starts to get some what interesting after that. There wasn't much of a twist in the ending beyond telling you who was responible for the crime. Overall the book is not worth your time.
2,BAD BOOK!,this is a horrible book! please dont read it!!! the story makes no sense and is VERY< VERY far fetched!
4,"The most popular Holmes mystery, with good reason!","I was totally into this book, turning page after page to unravel the very clever mystery. I don't give plot ""spoilers"", so generally this is about how Sherlock Holmes investigates a most unusual mystery involving an interesting ""family myth"" centering around how a cursed dog stalks and kills them. There are a few plot twists that I didn't see coming, and I was very happy with the book as a whole, it never gets boring, and the characters are very well developed, and will at times keep you guessing. The deductive reasoning of Sherlock Holmes is very rewarding to read, and puts a smile on the readers face. I recommend this one if you want to try out Doyle, or read a mystery novel."
5,Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would approve,"I'm new to audio books. But, I'm afraid I've already been spoiled. I wonder if there could possibly exist a better combination of author and reader. Holmes sounds just the way you'd expect the great sleuth to sound. Deliberate, never rushed and always a gentleman.The story is carefully woven and the presentation of the characters by Timson is masterful. I've listened to it over several times and each time I appreciate a little more the complexity and the detail. The Musical interludes are brief and sparse, but definitely compliment. If you like Sherlock Holmes, Timson is the right reader for the job. I'm buying the big collection now."
4,The Hounds of the Baskervilles criticism,"The story was a little uneasy at first, but the action and plot and all that good stuff kicks in. Seems to me, just one of those ""you have to get into the plot sort of books"" I'd recommend it to all, who would like to get into the Sherlock Holmes universe for the first time..."
5,"Like Classics, Read this Book","Follow Sherlock Holmes and his trusty colleague, Watson, in one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's best murder mystery ever, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Watch while Sherlock Holmes uncovers the mysteries of the Baskerville Hall of London.You and Sherlock Holmes get to discover all the clues of Charles Baskerville's mysterious death and protect Henry Baskerville from being murdered. You listen to stories of the notorious hound. Finally, before its too late, decide who is behind the murder of Charles Baskerville. Was it the baronet, Mr. And Mrs. Stapleton, or was it possibly Laura Lynes? Find out in the end.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle keeps you in suspense throughout the book. He keeps bringing in more leads to the story. The author also provides an interesting and intriguing topic with a tall tale creature tied in.This book is wonderful and would be best appreciated by all readers 10 and up."
3,The Hound of Baskervilles,"The Hound of the Baskervilles is an interesting book. I thought that it was a little hard to follow at first, but it gradually got better. In the end, The Hound of Baskervilles was a good book, but I have read better books before."
2,Let down in literature,"All endings of his short stories are exactly the same. I feel like I'm reading the same story over and over. After you have read one of his stories you have read them all. It is very boring to read his books and I do not enjoy them. All the plots are predictable, which takes the suspense out of the mystery."
4,The Hound of the Baskervilles,"The Hound of the Baskervilles, by Arthur Conan Doyle is a piquant mystery that leads you from suspicion to suspicion. Sir Charles Baskerville had recently died of exhaustion after running from the demonic Hound of the Baskervilles, the family curse. While going to claim his inheritance, Sir Henry, the last of the Baskervilles, is warned away from Baskerville Hall by an anonymous note. At any moment, Sir Henry's life might be put into peril by the beast or the culprit behind it, so Dr. Watson accompanies him to Baskerville Hall. Holmes must deduct who is behind these seemingly supernatural occurrences before the hound strikes again."
4,Hound of the Baskervilles,This book was used as an example of English literature of the period in an English Literature class for 8th graders which I teach. All of the young readers enjoyed the book and I am very pleased with the quality of the item and the children's responses to it.
4,"A great Sherlock Holmes novel, at a great price!","Dover has never let me down for purchasing great products, printed with excellence in mind at a mind-blowing low price! This book will be no exception.Essentially, Holmes finds himself in a mystery concerning a legend of a supernatural black hound that curses the Baskerville family. Holmes is intrigued, and he sends Watson to watch over the new Baskerville heir.The story is classic Holmes, and the action is fast paced and moving. A fun read with an eye on a classic local legend of the Isles! Highly recommended."
5,Enhanced with music and sound effects,"The first in Scenario Productions' ""The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes"" series and taken from the Archives of CBC Radio, this superbly presented radio adventure theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is a multicast presentation of a classic Sherlock Holmes story. This two audio cassette audio book has a two hour running time and is enhanced with music and sound effects for the perfect ""theater of the mind"" listening experience. This radio theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is enthusiastically recommended for all Sherlock Holmes fans and would make a very popular addition to school and community library audio book collections."
4,How great this book was !,"This is really good book I reccomend it: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson wait inside. It is late around 11:10 p.m. when they see a flash a light through the window. Then they hear a harsh mean howl at the lights apperance. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson duck down and be really quiet. Then they see the light again, but this time no howl. Then the light flashes again this time more like a flash light, light and sherlock knows it. He says , "" My dear Watson I think somebody is out there sending signals to us by light flashes""! Sherlock knows it for sure and then that day they hear that an exscaped prisoner is on the look and he is realted to the Baskervilles!"
3,Key passages missing,All indented quotes are missing. This includes the multiple-page origin of the hound and the obituary that provides important details.
2,"Good book, bad copy.","My problem isn't with the story, it's with this copy. If the character is reading something, you aren't. Every single time the author says that someone is reading something, it immediately cuts ahead to when they put the document away. For example, the entirety of the Legend of the Baskerville Curse is cut out, the article with the last Sir Baskerville's cause of death is cut out, a letter to the new Sir Baskerville is cut out... the list goes on. I've had to find another copy to fill in the blanks. The book is worth reading, but I'd spend the money to get an edition that actually has the whole story."
3,"good story, poor formatting","there seem to be passages missing from this version, which would have confused the story very much if i had not been familiar with it from before. i can remember two places where the story seemed to have significant and noticeable gaps. other than that, the story is a great one and if you are familiar with story prior to reading this version you will still enjoy reading it."
4,This book is phenomenal!,This book is a wonderful depiction of the Sherlock Holmes world. I think that this is the best depiction of the stories as a whole and is a must read for all ages.
2,Its OK,"I'm used to better quality mysteries.....just wanted to read a ""classic"" and I wasn't impressed. It was worth reading, I suppose, but I won't read it again..."
5,kindle book,"this was good copy, I enjoyed it. Smooth transaction, no problems at all, I will buy more in the future."
3,I was expecting a lot more...,"OK, the hype on this famous and classic book is huge. I was expecting a nail biting, cliff hanging, edge of my seat read. Instead, I figured out who the ""bad person"" was as soon as they were introduced. And there was nothing scary about the book at all. Sure, Holmes and Watson are very engaging characters and I enjoyed learning more about ""the bad person"" after all was said and done. But, I just didn't find anything that special about the story. Sorry!"
5,This book is awesome!,"I read this book and this is definitely my favorite of all the books I have read. This book is very, very, suspenseful and a little spooky. This was the first Sherlock Holmes book I have read and it got me hooked on Sherlock Holmes. I couldn't put this book down because it was so suspenseful and it was very entertaining. I would recommend this book to anyone."
1,missing content,I am very excited about reading this book but this version is missng a lot of vital passages. I was really disappointed with ths version and am seeking another version to download. Amazon please fix this ASAP. Sir Doyle would be appauled.
1,Mising Information/Incomplete,"This is one of my all time favorite books but;This Kindle version is missing very important parts to the story. Every time a letter or newspaper is read it is left blank. The whole story is based on the information in the letter and newspaper clippings. They are missing in this edition, even as a previous fan of the story I am having some difficulty in following along. If you are not familiar with the story you will be completely lost."
3,"Good mystery, but a little bit stretched",Another astounding story of the great Sherlock Holmes. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle composed a well-written novel that is one of teh better mysteries I've read. Some parts of the book can definitely be cut down. This 170 page novel could be cut to a 100 page novella. Good action and critical thinking solutions make this novel very interesting.
3,Hound of the Baskervilles Review,"A strange family legend combined with a mysterious death, add some other elements that aren't easily explained and you have the makings of a case that piques Sherlock Holmes' curiosity. This story is primarily set on the moors of Devon in England, the perfect backdrop for a creepy legend.I have to admit that I was a little disappointed with this story from Arthur Conan Doyle. As a lover of mysteries, I had been looking forward to reading a Sherlock Holmes story. But Holmes was absent from most of this book as Watson is on his own for a good portion of it.The Kindle version that I had was also missing some pertinent parts of the story, which I had to look up online to not be completely lost. And while the mystery they were solving was hardly over exciting, it was still a very enjoyable read with plenty of twists and turns to the plot."
1,Missing Critical Text!,"This version is missing text. As others have noted, whenever there is a quote from a newspaper article in the story, the text is missing. The entire legend of the ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" which does much to set the supernatural tone of the story, is missing! I'm only in Chapter 4 and have counted 3 missing passages already."
5,"Nice, basic version","Nice, basic book version of this classic Sherlock Holmes story. Comments/vocabulary in the back is a nice touch for those trying to learn from literature. Not deluxe, but worth the low price."
1,Don't bother downloading this copy,"As mentioned by the previous reviewer, this version is missing quite a bit of key content. Whether it's a formatting issue with the Kindle or the transcriber forgot to include the passages is unclear. But the story is unreadable without the missing text."
3,Sherlock Holmes,This book was a real mystery. It tells of murder and a supernatural hound behind it. It has alot of twist and turns on the perspective of the case. Just as you think you might have figure the case out you hit another dead end and try to start from scratch. This was one of of Holmes hard cases to figure out. I recommend it if you love Sherlock Holmes and mysteries.
4,Best Holmes,"Before there was CSI and the magic of solving a crime in less than 60 minutes we had Sherlock Holmes. This was always my favorite Sherlock Holmes story and the most scary Holmes book I ever read. Many movies were made from this book, but if you want the real deal, without the interpetations, you have to read the book. Plenty of atmosphere in a Holmes book, with a little imagination you can find yourself knocking on the door at 221B Baker street with a curious matter that needs Mr. Holmes attention.R HemingwayPast Twilight"
1,Kindle version is missing text that is central to the story,"This Kindle version is missing huge portions of text.For example, the entire manuscript read in Chapter 2 is missing.Amazon: please fix it or remove this defective version."
1,Missing passages ruin great story,"This is a great story, but as others have already noted, this Kindle version is missing numerous passages. This leaves the reader without important information needed to understand the plot. Get a different version!"
2,Not network friendly,"We chose this printer because of the network capability. The first printer stopped functioning correctly after three weeks. To print, we had to turn the printer off, then back on, and then print. We had to do this every time we wanted to print. HP sent us a replacement printer, and it worked correctly for 4 days. After over an hour on the phone with HP, I was told the printer is not very stable in a network application, and we should use the printer via a USB connection. If HP knows the unit is not stable in a network environment, then HP should correct the problem, or stop selling the unit."
5,Great Laser Printer,I had this printer working within minutes of opening the box. Very fast with quality print. An excellent value.
2,Will not work with PrintServers,I bought this printer and printserver separate so at any time I could switch out the printer without having to buy another wireless network ready printer. Problem is the HP Laserjet 1020 doesn't work with either the Netgear or Linksys Printservers which boggles the mind. My customer wan't happy and neither am I.
3,The music is the path,"First off, let me say that the CD gets 5 Stars! However, the visuals that accompany the music are seemingly stock National Geographic footage. There is zero narration, so where you are and what you are looking at is totally unknown. Basically, there is just no context to frame the scenery in. Do get the CD, though."
4,Great Gift!,"This is a great baby record book. The pages are so thorough and laid out so simply. I gave it to my cousin and she just loved it! I only gave it four stars because it didn't include a pouch or pocket page which I saw and liked in many other books, to keep newspaper clippings, the band from the hospital etc. Otherwise it is a great book!"
3,diagrammed psychology,"Of course I agree with other reviewers that the content of the book is very interesting. I read it completely, despite the painfully boring flatness of the prose itself. It might be useful for a psychologist trying to understand a patient in an unpleasant love affair: ah yes, now you're at Stage 2, subdivision 3, section 1a. Imagine a mechanical drawing, say, an exploded diagram of a pencil sharpener.. why not call it a work of art? Glorious detail, exact descriptions, complete and entire... But it's not a work of art creatively. To say that Svevo is a bridge between George Eliot and James Joyce misses totally the art of the language itself created by those two."
4,Almost There...,"This is the book whose relative failure made Svevo abandon his literary career for a decade or two until a young Irishman named James Joyce happened upon it while tutoring the then old man in English and realized its greatness. It's a wonderful story, the one of the future luminary resuscitating the old, broken spirit and it gave me the impetus to even pick up a Svevo book (that one being The Confessions of Zeno). But what is here? It is a very engaging, very biting, very vivid story, and one that is told with wit, grace and style. But (and there is usually a but) it clearly pales against his later masterpiece. If given a choice, I would definitely recommend Zeno over this one, but this is still a truly excellent read. The story of liasons gone awry, psychological musings and other problems of that then new creature, the Modern Neurotic, are the spine of this story, and they provide sturdy support... even if they get a better treatment in his next book."
5,SAILOR STARS ROCKS!!,"i dont own this, but i ahve all the MP3s and i just have to say that this cd is awesome!!!"
5,The Gratest Ever!!!,This is the absolute best of Sailor Moon right here. Not only is Sailor Moon Sailor Stars the best season ever the sonds are the GREATEST!
2,Warning for other buyers,"I bought this ring just for ring size testing, so the quality is not a problem for me. But there are something about this ring and it's center stone that i think i should let other buyers know in advance. I highly doubt the material is CZ(Cubic Zirconia). Through carefully observing under the x30 jewelers scope, the refractive index of the center stone seems to be very low, about 1.6, which is very close to glass but not CZ. Typically, a CZ has a refractive index around 2.15. And diamond is 2.4. For those who does not know what i was talking about, let's put it this way: The center stone does not sparkle at all and it looks cloudy...I guess i wont return it since it is very cheap..."
3,"Not her best but still fun, to say the least","This is a fun cd but a little too much pop for my taste. First half of this album is nothing but Candy singing to bubblegum pop music. The second half has a Latin feel to it, which is nice. This is a nice album to give to someone who only listens to only pop and swears to not like jazz. But for someone looking for an honest jazz cd, this isn't it. I just hope Candy puts more saxophone in her next album, and a lot less vocal."
3,Right in My Soul is at it's best.....,"when it displays its soul and dispenses with the drum and bass. First of all this is not even remotely a jazz cd, I count 8 of the 14 tracks that would be considered drum and bass/downtempo. ...My Soul will be purchased on the strength of of MY LOVE alone which is flat out the best urban track I've heard in 2003. Other highlights are the cuts Everyday People, December and the quirky Freak Out. Don't get me wrong, Candy can blow and Mindy Adair should contact her for some lessons, but most of Right in My Soul sounds like Kraftwerk attempted to make a jazz cd...."
4,Sweet Candy,This is a very good CD. If I could just stop playing Finsbury Park I could really enjoy the other songs even more.Very talented lady!
2,Plastic limitations,"When I got the product and opened the box, the literature said that you cannot use the kind of shower head that has a valve that turns off the flow. This is because the filter housing is plastic and is subject to cracking or bursting if you turn off the flow downstream from the filter.That's the kind of shower head I have, and I like to use the valve feature. I really really wish that eGeneralMedical had said this in their (limited) online literature. And they expect me to pay the return shipping and a 15% restocking fee!"
3,Shower Filter Cartridge,"This is probably the fourth replacement cartridge I have purchased, but this time it did not include a replacement for the rubber ""O"" ring that seals the cartridge in the housing. So now I have a drip to deal with. Not good."
5,Couldnt have been easier!,I purchased this system a year ago and have been dreading having to change the filter. I HATE changing filters on anything because it's never as easy as the manufacturer claims. I just changed the filter and it took me about 2 minutes. Super easy! I love this product! My skin isn't all itchy when I take a shower anymore!
3,Outdated but Remarkable for Its Time,"I would actually give this book 3.5 stars. The only reason I'm not giving it more stars is that the concepts regarding the evolution of the spiritual man, though still retaining some validity, seem somehow outmoded. In addition, the writing style is a bit anachronistic. However the author was remarkable for his time (which was not all that long ago) and he is still very much worth reading. He was an underrated, somewhat eclectic philosopher who was courageous enough to question the scientism of his day."
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,"While this DVD will, in fact, be playable on a computer or a Region 1 player, the image quality is very poor. Scenes shot outdoors will be washed out and overexposed, and any rapid on-screen motion will cause the image to blur perceptibly. This gets worse as the film progresses. I got suckered into buying this clinker before warnings about the difference in regions were posted prominently. However, I don't believe incompatibility entirely accounts for the poor performance of this product: it looks and behaves like a poorly-executed copy of a copy made by a company that is not equipped (or doesn't care enough) to produce a high-quality DVD."
5,JOHN WAYNE!!!!!!,What else is there to say about a John Wayne movie that has not been said. Good fast service and good movie.
4,VERY GOOD,"I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE MANY TIMES PRIOR TO BUYING IT. I BOUGHT IT ON LINE AS A PACKAGE DEAL WITH 2 OTHER DVD'S. EVEN WALMART WANTED TO MUCH MONEY AND I WENT TO SEVERAL BEFORE I FOUND ONE. I LIKE JOHN WAYNE, BUT I BOUGHT IT FOR THE FONDA ACTING. HE PLAYS THE PART WELL."
4,Fools rush in,"DVD newcomer ""Fort Apache"" (1948) looks great, with minimal wear on its crisp black-and-white images (from original nitrate elements) and bugle-brisk audio. The film, ironically, finds Henry Fonda playing the maddeningly hawkish cavalry commander against John Wayne's humanistic officer willing to risk all for peace and justice.The (single) DVD has no documentary on the exciting and heartfelt film, a shame. It does include a 15-minute piece on Monument Valley, covering Ford's significant and seemingly beneficial role in the Indian reservation's history. The Navajo, paid good wages for their appearances, called him ""Giant Soldier."" ""I've kissed more babies than a politician,"" Ford said.""Part of his vision of the world was that we're all very small in the scheme of things,"" film historian Joseph McBride says. ""I think (Monument Valley) gives a dimension of moral seriousness to his work that was intensified as he went along.""[...]"
3,Fort Apache Colorized,This is part of the John Ford Trilogy and I would consider it an outstanding classic. It's all start class shines and the action is all that one can desire.It was too bad that the film was not originally filmed in color but the studio did not want to pay the money to do it in color. It wasn't until the last movie in the trilogy She wore a yellow Ribbon was filmed that the Studio agreed to have it filmed in color. Turner decided that when he bought the film to pay to have it colorized. A great job was done. Unfortunately when it was released on video tape it was recorded in EP mode. This was a big mistake and there was little reason to do it. Thus as a movie I would give it and it colorization 5 stars but for releasing it in EP I would give Turner 1 star
3,Why not colorised?,"I've always liked this movie and some years ago I bought a colourised VHS copy in NYC. I was amazed how much better it was, I would say 100% and the tape was in EP speed! Back in the 40s so many would have been made in colour had the producers forseen the future, VHS, laserdisc and DVD. The colour was very good even at EP speed, so imagine it on blu ray. I know some fans of the movie prefer the original B/W, so why not put it out on blu ray with two seperate discs as they did recently with ""It's A Wonderful Life"". Those blue uniforms with yellow stipes come out wonderful. The movie itself I would give 5 stars but because of this disapointing release it's only three."
3,Fort Apache (1948) B&W Blu-ray,"As soon as the DVD was available it was shipped and arrived in great shape. The Blue-ray version of this classic is clearly a better picture, but I was sorely disappointed in the FULL screen format. My older version, even though not blue-ray is a better field of view, pan-scan I think, but closer to widescreen. I must have missed the Screen size on my per-order of this movie."
4,Fort Apache My Review,"Fort Apache, is one of the best westerns and war movies. Henry Fonda is great as the crazy commander, John waynes knowlegable calvaryman part is a great balance to Fondas. The Irish sargent and the confederate veteran stand out too. The Apaches are less villified than usual, with the focus on the Calvarys problems."
5,One of the Duke's best westerns,"John Ford and John Wayne teamed up to do many films during their days in Hollywood and this western adventure is among the best horse operas ever made. Set in picturesque Monument Valley, a favorite Ford outdoor setting, the movie tells of life in an army outpost in Arizona and the unease of officers and enlisted men under the command of a disgruntled, by-the-book lieutenant colonel. Henry Fonda is excellent as the martinent who alienates his men and clashes with Wayne's Captain York throughout the film, their differences exploding during a peace parley with the Apaches which ends in a rousing cavalry-Indian engagement near the end of the movie. Ford's regulars, led by Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen and Hank Worden are among the cast members, and Shirley Temple and John Agar provide the romantic angle in the proceedings. The black and white cinematography by Archie Stout is striking and Richard Hageman's wistful score are among the film's top notch production values."
3,A patchy tape,"The VHS of FORT APACHE that I received under this URL is not a TURNER release, but a much earlier VIDAMERICA product, one with different cover art. It's so old there's a label on the cover reading: ""THE AFFORDABLE COLLECTABLES - Thirty-four ninety-five."" (<--numeric)The box is sealed on all sides. To extract the tape one opens the top flap. This mid-1980s recording is in SP mode, but has only a linear mono audio track (no HiFi), clear but with a faint hiss to it. Film stock used is unrestored and often shows snow specks, but no scratch lines or edit breaks. Picture is high-contrast and lacks subtle detail. An average product at best. Watchable, though."
3,Overrated,This is one of the most famous western ever made. Henry Fonda plays a commanding officer who acts like Custer-with the same results Custer had. I find the Henry Fonda character unpleasent to watch-to the point of being unblieveable. It as not any where as good as the other John Ford cavalry movies. My advice is to skip this movie and watch 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' and 'Rio Grande'.
3,Great old time movie,The scenery out West is great. Open and vast and quiet and clean.I have been out in that area and after the city - it helps to calm and center you and helps you to better understand the characters and plot lines better.
5,Classic Western,"John Ford was one of the greatest directors to ever step on a movie set. He was proficient in many genres but won his most acclaim for his Westerns - especially those starring John Wayne. Fort Apache ranks among his best offerings, having not only great direction but also two super stars at the peak of their powers. Duke Wayne and Hank Fonda play contrasting characters who share one thing in common - the call to duty. The scenery is glorious and the pacing sublime in this highly recommended film."
1,Stick with SimCity or Capitalism 2,"I was thinking ""SimCity helped me learn about real estate and land use in a fun way, so maybe this game might help me learn something."" This game has no educational value. But more importantly, it wasn't even fun.Okay, maybe it was fun for about an hour as I learned my way around the game. But that was mostly anticipation. I then realized that I'd seen all there was to see. Don't waste your time. This game is simplistic and has no depth whatsoever. SimCity is still the best real estate game around, even if it is only in a roundabout sort of way. If you want a good, educational business game, try Capitalism 2. Good tutorials and an actual understanding of how businesses run. If you want a fun business game, there are plenty of other tycoon games that have to be better than this."
2,It's passable,"Real Estate Tycoon is just OK. The premise is strong but the graphics and interface are clunky, the sound average, and the business functions are weak. It's a cheap game...you get what you pay for."
2,Where did the tutorials go?,"I played the game through all levels of the tutorials and advanced to 'one-on-one' with D. Trump... I did okay. Then I didn't play the game for while and when I went to play it again and get a refresher from the tutorials they were ""GONE""! Now the game will not play at all...... No help from the 'Website' either.. That is just an order site only. So I would not buy this again."
5,A FUN EVENT!,Hey not many people I know watch the apprentice but pretty soon everybody I know will play the computer game of it! It totally rocks! You have to try it. Donald Trump is amazing. I love the game. And I got it from amazon for a really cheap price. Amazon has the cheapest prices you could imagine.
3,good book,its a nice book altough somthimes confusing because the different personages being discribed in a thirth person while the writer talks about himself in first person reads easy azltough the book is rather small
5,Small but very nice!,"I bought this for a little Valentine's day gift for my 2.5yo. He has good fine motor skills for his age, so he can handle the tiny size. He's not into coloring the pictures in yet, just lots of enthusiastic stamping, counting, making animal sounds, and naming the animals and colors, which this is great for. I do think that if your child wants to color the pictures in, you'll want the bigger stampers. But this set is so cute, easy to store, and the 4-color stamp pad is nice. A lot of fun in a tiny package, and definitely worth the 6 bucks!"
5,farm animal stamps,looks nice. i purchased this as a gift & it has not been used yet. so i can't really rate it.
3,Just ok,My daughter likes the animal stamps but the stamp pad is not good at all. It dries up very quickly even with proper storage. The wood box they come in is nice for storing all the stamps neatly. Just have some extra stamp pads on hand.
4,Friedhofer: a good sampling,"The ""golden era"" of Hollywood had film scores written by the likes of Rozsa, Steiner, Newman, Herrmann, and Friedhofer. Hugo Friedhofer is primarily remembered for his Academy Award winning music to THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES. Most of his scores are rich orchestral masterpieces but he is not as well known as well as some of his contemporaries. Still, his music is worth a listen today.Marco Polo continues recording music from ""forgotten"" film classics with commendable performances by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra. This CD contains superb music from four of his earlier works: ADVENTURES OF MARCO POLO -- 1937, 13 min.; THE LODGER -- 1944, 20 min.; RAINS OF RANCHIPUR -- 1955, 15 min.; SEVEN CITIES OF GOLD -- 1955, 25 min.Digital recording on Marco Polo CD."
3,Did not recieve yet,Takes to long to get subscriptions with Amazon. I ordered about 8 subscriptions and have only recieved 3 thus far. Not sure why ot takes 6-8 weeks to get a subscription started.
1,Not so great.,DISAPPOINTING!!! This album was a complete let down. It is watered down. As bland as a piece of toast with no butter. Plain rock. Nothing Ducky Boys about it. I hate this album. I really do. I hope that they realize this and never attempt this type of sound again.
4,Mixed Reviews,I have to say that this DVD series is somewhat frustrating. There were some moments when I felt like turning it off so stupid it was and then at others it really hit home. This isn't a great series start but it is a decent one and I'll buy the rest of the series.
5,"Fun Series, but I'm biased","OK, first I'll admit to a strong bias. My day job is to limit orbital debris creation from NASA satellites, so any series that recognizes the importance of my daily struggle is an automatic win with me.That said, I think the show is interesting, and something I could see watching on Saturday mornings for fun. They've included enough interpersonal relationship stuff to keep it interesting, but with the backdrop of nerdy space facts. I love to destroy these kinds of shows on technical inaccuracies, but I find that harder to do with this series. The writers seem to have made the effort to actually research their topic a little bit, and tried to stick to facts. There are a few inventions to fit the story lines, but for the most part they try to be reasonably accurate.The interviews in the bonus tracks are pretty good, and I use them in my classes on orbital debris."
3,a mixed bag of anime,"I've watched PLANETES volume 1, and it's a mixed bag of anime, at best. The overall setting is great... it's an interesting idea accented by science-based technology. There's nothing ridiculous about any of the gadgetry or environments... I just wish I could say the same for the characters.Do other reviewers really like the cast? They whine and scream more often than not, and the comic relief is painfully uncomfortable. The main character... a young, new recruit... is a noise machine. If she's not screwing up, she's pontificating and just won't shut up. The even bigger problem with that is she's not the loudest of the bunch. Her spineless bosses are absolutely imbecilic and unlikable on every level.I'm all for human stories, but I didn't pick this title up to see men sing and dance in their underwear with the hopes of winning the lottery. How is that ""Clarksian""? It's just a goofy plot point, in my book."
5,Extreme Trains: The complete Season One,My husband loves steam trains. This was a Christmas present for him. He has spent many enjoyable hours watching it.
2,Disappointing,"I got this video on loan from Netflix. As a railfan, I was extremely disappointed in this. The show was nothing like I had anticipated it being like. And the host is just plain annoying trying to emulate Emeril Lagasse"
2,EXTREMEly obnoxious,"The videography of the trains is outstanding. Unfortunately, the host is about as obnoxious as they come. Screaming, jumping around, arms flailing, and extremely dumb dialog (you can see just about everyone he interviews/works with cringes at the things he says). On top of that, the rapid jump cutting is enough to make you want to hurl. No joke! Most of the scenes shot of Matt's dialog is with the camera right on the ground pointing up towards him while he's shouting at the camera flailing his arms around.This could have been an excellent series, but it is ruined and unwatchable by the script and host. I'm shocked that anyone liked it."
5,"Hello, my name is...and I love trains!","I stumbled upon this series while looking for train shows for my 6 year old son...he loves the show so much we have almost every show to date and will definitely buy this dvd. He has even begun to say ""Hello, my name is Kieran and ever since I was little I have loved trains.""I have to agree Matt is awesome...he is grown kid playing with real life trains....I learned so much about trains and the history about them that I can't wait til next season....Trains rule at our house! We are train hunters...no matter where trains are we will find them."
5,"A must for the Railfans, kids, and transpotters","An avid fan of trans, and model railroading, I love this show. It's the favorite show of my 4 year old who watches an episode at least daily, and knows more about the operations of railroads than most adults because of this show.The camera work is well done, and captures the hard steel and movement of a train. Matt Bown is a great host who adds excitement and his love of trains with the audience, giving great descriptions of the technical aspects of railroading. You'll walk away from the show with a greater understanding of trains and a deeper love for them as well.The extras are nice, as there are some scenes from nearly every episode that never aired. I would liked to have seen some audio commentary though."
4,Your Engineered House,"This 1964 book is a testament to the individual's ability to imagine and build one's own home. It is a book to be inspired by. I read the book while overseas and immediately became convinced that I could build my own home. After retirement, my wife and I did just that, with great success. Do not buy this book thinking that it will provide explicit directions. The engineering is old and often outdated. Read it rather as an evocative tribute to human ingenuity and ability. This should not be your last book on building design, but it might very well be your best first book."
3,Simple Explanation,"this song is not from the T.V series berserk but rather from the series bubblegum crisis tokyo 2040, its the ending theme, and a pretty good song at that. But I recommend you buy a more complete CD with more BGC songs on it, (I'm not really partial to singles otherwise, considering this is a good song, I would of given it a higher rating)."
2,Black?,"The background for this puzzle is black, which makes putting the puzzle together very difficult indeed. It's not much fun and the picture isn't as good as some. Not an enjoyable experience at all - and we love puzzles!"
4,Good Book,"I happen to love books written completely in letter format, so I enjoyed ""Hands Across the Moon."" It's the story of two friends who are separated during their junior year because one of them must move to Ecuador with her family. The book documents their year apart through the letters that they use to keep in touch with. I am not so sure everything that happens is COMPLETELY realistic, but it is realistic enough.The only thing I would say that I didn't like was not enough information was given about the characters' families. There isn't much detail--but that makes the letters real. At the end of the book, I found myself wondering what happened next.I think it's worth the read."
4,Bighorse the Warrior,"If you have an hour to two hours, and have any interest in Native American History from an Indian perspective, Tiana's story of Bighorse is a gem to find! Short, but sweet, this biography was told out of love, but also told because the the Indian's perspective of American History is often muted and/or erased. This book definitely keeps their spirit alive!"
5,Bighorse Warrior Comes Alive,"I've met the author - Tiana Bighorse Butler. Her pride shines through as she tells the stories of her father. Written in Navajo english, the reader is taken into the traditional navajo way of life. Wonderful stories give an honest perspective and a clear understanding of warriors in that point of time. Buy this book!! Compelling reading that you'll never forget!!"
3,Easy read,"The topic which this book covers, the oppression of the Apache Indians by the American Government, particularly the Long Walk, is an amazing story of struggle and brutal oppression. However, this story, an account of the events from a family memeber of Big Horse the Warrior, leaves the reader feeling a little slighted. Very little detail of the horrific events is given and worse yet, the events end up sounding watered down, as if they really weren't that bad.Overall, I feel the historical event of tragic proportion deserves a much better account which brings the readers into the emotional aura surrounding the events."
2,smells bad,"Smells bad, just like any other tanning lotion, and the smell stays on your skin all day. would not recommend"
2,Disappointed.,"I was really excited about this product since it had so many wonderful reviews, especially coming from people with pale skin like mine. The product didn't live up to my expectations at all. I turned orange the first night, but I continued to try it out for at least a week to be able to give an accurate review. I just became more and more orange, it streaked everywhere, and overall looked extremely fake. I'm really disappointed because I thought this would finally be the best tanning product out there for people with light/pale skin, but once again it just didn't work. I think this would work well for others who have a base tan already."
4,Fair Meets Sun,I'm practically an albino so I've had no luck with this type of product until now. The coloring is gradual and looks like a light base golden brown and has a nice scent. Good as it gets.
2,Oompa Loompa,"I wanted to love this, I really did. Unfortunately, just like every other self tanner on the planet, I looked orange. That being said, I was not nearly as orange as some other products have made me, which made fixing my mistake with exfoliating a lot less difficult."
3,As a lover of words...,"I was hoping that the title meant: ""Advanced grammar and its more arcane forms""What it truly meant was: ""Normal grammar text with a supercilious and pompous title""My father was always strict about grammar as I grew up, and rather growing a dislike for it, I fell in love with words and word play. I became the type of person who would argue the merits of the Oxford Comma and wonder about bound root morphemes with friends. I fantasize about owning my own copy of the OED. I wanted a book to review the more difficult and erudite aspects of English grammar. The title intrigued me, but failed to live up to my expectations. This is a fairly rudimentary treatment of grammar. I've seen better, and I've seen worse. Not a purchase I regret, but do not expect anything beyond the standard grammar text that attempts to be interesting."
5,ELEGANT AND EASY,"Barry Tarshis has given us a remarkably well done guidebook to that often complicated language we call ""English"". It is a priceless helping hand for everyone - students, writers, professionals, and just plain folks. Bravo Mr. Tarshis!"
3,"5 stars for the music, 1 star for the reissue","No doubt about the quality of the songs and Albert Lee's skills, but buyers should know that, in comparison to the original vinyl on A&M and Polydor, the stereo channels are swapped on all tracks on this CD reissue, thus being of no real interest to the serious collector. So 5 stars for the music and 1 star for those responsible for the remastering process."
5,An excellent and enjoyable resource,"After reading ""Seduce Me! How to Ignite Your Partner's Passion"", I immediately made arrangements to purchase an initial order of 50 copies for our medical office. Through our patient-centered obstetrics and gynecology practice, we treat thousands of women annually and receive questions and concerns about sexual libido daily.I found this book to be very informative, presenting scientific biochemical data and psychological insights in a manner that any of our patients could easily comprehend.Beyond that, the recommendations offer clear and fun solutions, addressing both sexual and relationship issues. I would estimate that 1 in 4 women I see daily ask me about problems with sexual desire and fulfillment, and I am very pleased to be able to provide ""Seduce Me!"" to them as an excellent and enjoyable resource."
2,Not Much New Here,"I did find Cole's analysis of seducing a woman's mind first by helping her clear it useful. Other than that, it's like reading a cheap novel, but without much vulgarity. There are more credible resources. And frankly, I think there's just nothing new here."
3,Wrong label,"It is NOT large print ! I can't read it. The book itself is fine, but don't sell it as large print !!"
2,Bad ink?,"Item arrived with black powdery smudges on the cover and edge of paper. I don't know if it's from the laser ink powder of the packing slip, or if it's from the printing on the cover. It is acceptable but messy. Also, the photo clearly shows a set of 2 books, but there's only one as detailed in the description."
5,Genious Allegory of the Christian Life - Timeless!,"This book is truly a literary classic! Although written over 400 years ago, this allegory of the Christian life is still relevant today. It still speaks to incredible depths of the Christian experience, the struggles as well as the joys. You'll feel the emotion of ""Christian"" as he encouters a number of characters, all named for their particular life experience.I have read this book 4 times in the last 10 years, and plan to again this year. Everytime I pick it up my relationship with God is strengthened. I have also refered to it many times in conversation. What more could you ask for in a book!If you're not comfortable with the old english, then try a modern language version. Either way you won't be disappointed. I guarantee it!"
4,Pilgrim's Progress stands with the world's best literature.,"I read The Pilgrim's Progress as a child and recently reread it in order to do a comparative essay on allegorical journeys for my english class. The other book I read for the assignment was Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad, and I found that Bunyan's novel equaled or exceeded Conrad's in every way. While Conrad used far more symbolism and allusions, I felt that Bunyan still did a better job of making the reader identify with his character's journey. The Pilgrim's Progress is a wonderfully written story that inspires hope and confidence in God to help his people though their own journeys."
3,Review *THIS* edition of the book!,"I would like to see a review of this Element Classics of World Spirituality edition of Pilgrim's Progress. I realize that it is a widely read book, but which edition is best? Is *THIS* edition good? There's been about 500 different editions of this book since the time it was written! Someone please write a review of *THIS* edition!Please ignore my rating. It is not valid. I had to put something there to publish this message."
1,Puritanism at its best.,"This is SELF-righteous, SELF-centered Historical Puritanism at its best. This is the foundation of the ""I'm right and everyone else is wrong,"" Puritanical UN-Christianity. Always remember there is a big difference between a Puritan and a Christian (Look those two words up for yourself!)."
4,"Retro 80's. Nice flashback vibe of ska & soul, Like no other.","This is a super album. Not to diss the British but The UNTOUCHABLES outta L.A. mastered that soul/ska sound better than THE ENGLISGH BEAT. ""I Confess"" is the only song I can deal with by those guys.The UNTOUCHABLES are far more intelleGENT and talented with their sound selection. Favorites ""I Spy For The F.B.I."", ""Freak In The Streets"", ""What's Gone Wrong"", ""Free Yourself"", ""Piece Of Your Love"", ""Steppin' Stone (Live)"", ""Shine On"" and My Kind Of Girl"". This CD keeps you on the move.I cannot give them 100% props though, their style tends to get a little corny but it's ok, it's ok. I'm not dissing the THE ENGLISH BEAT at all, but with that beat they need some UNTOUCHABLE soul..like this!!!!"
4,Great 80's Ska Funk Soul Revival!,"The Untouchables were knocking around SoCal back in the early 80's putting out their brand of Soulful Ska. This is great stuff in the English Beat Selecter mode with some Soul And Funk thrown in the mix. Songs like Wild Child, I Spy For The FBI and Free Yourself should move you, unless you're dead. A few songs sound dated (80's production)but for the most part very fresh. This CD contains ALL of the music recorded/released by Stiff UK ( The US Enigma EP The Lp on MCA and B-sides and single versions of lp tracks)So happy that this was reissued! What are you waiting for.. come on and FREE YOURSELF!"
