5,amusing,"How can an opera become amusing? This is a beautiful opera, plenty of humor and nice music.Martin Pitchon"
3,I have to use more,"I bought this detergent mainly to clean cloth diapers, but I've been using it for all my laundry, too. At first, I didn't think it got the clothes or the diapers clean. The diapers came out of the wash with a faint urine scent, and work out clothes still sort of smelled like B.O. It was not good for getting out food stains either. Then I tried using twice as much as the directions say (1/4 cup instead of 1/8 of a cup), and that did the trick. I was surprised because I have a water softener on my house, so I usually use less soap than directed. Anyway, now it works fine. It kind of smells bad, though."
3,"good for some laundry, really bad for stains on white shirts","Charlies soap really deep cleans towels and clothes for soap sensitive people. My husband's white shirts had been washed before, with no problems. When I pre-treated as instructed on the bottle, they came out of the washer permanently spotted, therefore ruined. Hard to handle when the shirts are from Nordstrom. Also, the claim it gets out blood, it stained the undergarments without removing the stains. I guess I will go back to Tide for the tough stain problems!"
1,"If it's so safe, then why don't they list the ingredients on their website?","After searching for a long time, I finally found an internet post from someone who had actually called the company and asked for a list of the ingredients. Here's an excerpt of that post:""I no longer would use or recommend Charlie's Soap as a 'natural' cleaner. Their active ingredient that they called butylcelosolv is Czech for 2-Butoxyethanol acetate, also known as Butyl Cellosolve. According to the [Environmental Working Group's] Skin Deep Database, which rates it a 5 (moderate hazard), butoxyethanol has ties to cancer, reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, and more. It's used in hundreds of cleaning products, even as an oil spill dispersant.... Charlie's Soap lists 2-butoxyethanol on its MSDS if there's any question."""
5,A little goes a long way,Charlie's Soap is a detergent. It's one downfall is that it is not a disinfectant and a separate disinfectant must be used. I love it though because it gets the cloth diapers clean and keeps the stains to a minimum.
4,Texas Blues Primer,"One of the great AF cds, and one of the first to use vocalist Sam Myers, a blind man from Mississippi who allowed AF to do some of his best work on many albums. Texas blues due to the danceability, easy to sing along lyrics, humor, heavy beat, and sound backup band.Though Sam Myers has since passed, and the AF portion of the band stalled, the whole lineup of AF is pretty good, though I personally prefer the Anson F & Sam Myers works the best"
4,Disney Princess Lamp,Very nice product. I just wish you could adjust the volume on the lamp. It is very loud.
1,Buyer Beware!,Buyer Beware - The picture of the lamp depicted is not the same as the lamp I received. I ordered this product because of the colors (the purple to be exact). I got a completely pink lamp with a different design. Not what I expected. I am debating sending it back (just got it in 20 minutes ago)
2,Buy another nylon string,This guitar is not really good in any respect. It is horrible without an amp. The shallow bowl cannot project any worthwhile sound. I thought it would be a pretty good starting point for a nylon based on the reviews here but its not. The cheaper Ibanez units sound better - found that out later. With an amp its got some sound - its just not anything I can get into or play in front of people. Look elsewhere for your nylon needs. It did improve when I changed the strings to silk and steel and you can do that on this unit because of the bridge design. That is not the sound I want either but it makes the guitar not a total bust.
4,good value,"I like it. Has decent action, easy to play, and acoustic tone is pretty good for what it is. Sounds great when played with a Roland Micro-cube. Paid $300 for a used one including Ovation hard case. Don't know what they are talking about with ""mahogany top"" in the product info. This guitar has a solid cedar top."
5,Great for the money,Great deal for the money; has an unusual number of connecting wires. Grey color blends with my flooring color better than does white or beige.
2,alright,"it was a movie to watch but, i think it had a man who looked like Dahmer but he couldn't act at all..... I think the other Dahmer movie that is out is so unique compared to this movie....something wasn't right with this movie.....it was tacky......"
1,PERHAPS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF MOVIES,"I've got to hand it to the makers of this film; their ability to dedicate months of their lives to the production of a film so utterly devoid of anything that makes movies worth seeing is a true testament to the motion picture industry. I can only hope that the families of Jeffrey Dahmer's victims, (to whom the film is dedicated) haven't seen this film.But, inspired by this film, I won't dig too deep. If you are looking for a laugh and a few instantly classic (unintentionally) catch phrases to throw around with your college buddies, I would spend UP TO one American dollar to rent this film."
1,whose carl crew???,I just been reading these reviews and must ask who is Carl Crew that one has stated plays Jeffery Dahmer??? the actor that plays Dahmer is Jeremy Renner.
3,anyone with a dahmer facination,"Anyone who even remotely finds Dahmer fascinating or even inspiring should watch this movie.I liked it better than the film dahmer. It was more realistic and less hollywood. It does turn on a switch for homo-sexual tenndencies of the late serial killer. Yes, its poor quality, but its one of those films that sticks to your mind and leaves you in an odd mood all day. I would have liked to see more of Jeffrey'ss daily activities, but other than that, see it for yourself."
4,kudos to losing weight for diabetics,"this cookbook by jenny craig is fantastic. i am on jenny craig right now and while i am not diabetic, it does run in the family; better safe than sorry. so far i have used the french toast recipe and the ground beef recipe. it offers advice/exchanges on carbohydrates, proteins, dairy, meats and their substitutes, fruits and veggies and a new category. OTHER. i highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to lose weight and is diabetic or has family members who are diabetic. THIS BOOK EXPLAINS HOW CARBOHYDRATES CAN AFFECT BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS FOR DIABETICS. to me that is more important than a low carb fad diet. there has to be meaning to it. this puts it into perspective."
3,Pay attention to the attaching brackets,"The lounge itself seems to be great, however the bulky plastic attaching hooks will not fit in the wire opening of my ferrets cage. Now I made this cage myself and it would probably fit in most store bought cages but those cages weren't big enough for my ferrets. If you have cage wire with less than a 3/4"" opening than this will not fit in the wire."
5,Good sturdy canvas hammock,"I don't know about your ferret, but ours eventually chews right through those other thin flimsy ferret hammocks. If she's not ripping through the fabric, then she's chewing the hanging straps off. This one is much better made than the others- thick canvas sling and thicker straps to hang from. She's enjoying it and I think it will last longer than the other thin ones."
2,I was hoping for soooo much more!,"Although I gave this film 2 stars and didn't like it as a whole, it did have some interesting moments. I think that if the director didn't include the B-storyline of the friend looking for Monica, it would've been a better film. The acting was pretty bad on that side of things.I would've liked the film to have focused on the dynamics between the man and Monica. I will also say that the ending was a little abrupt for me. I know this film was ""based on true events"", which makes it pretty tragic. But what I found more tragic is that the story wasn't presented to the viewer better."
2,Starved,"The acting wasn't bad, but for a movie like this it should have been shot on a bigger budget. Also I was dissapointed that there was no exploitation in the movie, This movie is no collector, It's just a low budget movie somebody probably shot in a day."
4,great duvet,"I am a very picky buyer, the moment I got this product I was so satisfied, the material is excellent, I washed it and the cloth didn't shrink, I hope this will last and I just recently used it...so can't say much, but I like European made products, they have quality and for the price, can't complain it's very reasonable...thank you amazon..."
3,Bought on sale- and I got what I paid for,"I bought this cover when it was 50% off. After the first wash, the cover pilled horribly, and now looks fairly shabby. However, it is warm, and it does do what it is designed to do, so I guess that would make it worth buying. However, I would have rated it much lower had I paid the full price for it. I bought a much nicer duvet cover off of [...] last year, which came with two pillowcases, for twenty dollars, and the only reason I bought this one was because the cover ripped."
3,Much thinner then expected,"I purchased this on sale from Amazon in November for about 40% off their normal selling price. Well, I received exactly what I paid for. The item I received is only worth about half of what it normally sold for.It you wish for a thin cover, buy this one."
3,comfy and messy,"I have both the duvet cover and the sheets. The good is that they are really cozy, even more so than jersey sheets. The bad is that they are a never ending source of lint balls. A lint roller is of no help, as it turns out."
1,Pills too much,"When you wash this thing, it's like an explosion of snow. Good thing it was cheap. I've never seen anything in my life pill so much."
4,"Nice, but it gave my gf hives","This claims to be 100% cotton, but my girlfriend who isn't allergic to cotton broke out in insane hives all over her body. We figured it was the blanket because we didn't use it on some days and one day it was horrible, she was using that only.It's probably cursed by the devil.Aside from this, it's nice, soft, and also light enough to use as a summer blanket, which I plan on doing."
2,Bed Sheets,"I didn't like these sheets, because you have to put them inside of the matress I do like their softness though, but they are very hard to put on the bed."
1,Be careful - not a great product.,"First, be careful. The product name says this is a ""Solid Flannel King Duvet, Ivory"" but this is not a Duvet. This is a Duvet COVER. In other words, that fluffy picture you see with this product is NOT what you are going to get. You will get two flat sheets basically sewen together. And the quality of it is less than I anticipated, (pilly). But like others have mentioned, you get what you pay for. I sent mine back."
3,Good soft cover but pills a lot,"I really like this product very much except for the fact that it pills everywhere, anywhere, all the time. I'm hoping it'll stop after a while, but at this point, it's the price I have to pay for owning it. Also, it's very warm and can't really be used during the summertime in warm areas."
5,Great buy!,I bought this when it was a Gold Box special. What a great buy.160 grams=5.6 ounces. This is a nice beefy duvet cover.Very thick and soft.
4,Flannel duvet,Exactly what I expected and wanted at a fantastic price. What more can you want? The only thing that could make it better is someone to help you put on the duvet. I ordered the snow pea and the light blue and am happy with my purchase.
5,very nice duvet cover,"The duvet cover is perfect, and the gift recipient couldn't be happier. The item arrived well in time for Christmas and was just what we wanted."
2,"Cheap quality, do not be fooled","The flannel on this item is of poor quality. You can actually pick at the flannel cotton as it very vulnerable to pilling. The flannel is also very thin. Just keep in mind you will lose practically all the value of the item if you choose to return it to Amazon because of the shipping charges. Do not be fooled by the other reviews, this is a cheap product, and not priced accordingly."
4,Great value for money,This duvet cover is excellent value. It washes really well and is really warm and comfy. The flannel sheets by the same brand are also well worth the $.
4,Solid Flannel King Duvet Cover,"This is a dreamingly soft flannel duvel cover. Very nice color and just perfect for the price!Mill Valley, CA"
2,DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING....,"I ordered this item as a gift. The picture displays a bedding set with pillowcases, sheet, etc. I thought this is what I purchased. I was wrong. They sold me a duvet cover ONLY. It is NOT a great price for only a duvet cover. Please be careful and don't get fooled like I did."
1,Mowtown,"The audio on this DVD is missing. I will return this product, for a replacement, as soon as I can."
3,Could have been so much more!,"This latest installment of DVD's from UMG does not do justice to the body of work by the Four Tops. Their signature song ""Just The Four of Us"" is glaringly missing from this set which ends before their return to Motown. The quirky audio was not a problem on our Blue Ray Disc player, but the horribly out of synch audio/video in the Interview section was hard to watch and annoying. Changing audio setting did nothing to correct this issue. This group deserved much more TLC than what UMG ultimately released. There should be a Volume 2 to fill out their career (especially with the passing of Levi) with more care given to getting it right before pushing it out the door. Overall, this DVD is a must for any Motown fan."
5,Nostalgia at its Finest,"I absolutely loved this - having grown up during the Four Tops heyday, this brought back so many memories of the era, their music, everything. I was glued throughout. The footage is wonderful, the concerts and tv shows were really great to watch. What a privilege it must have been to be the interviewer! Abdul Duke Fakir was wonderful and so obviously deeply touched in telling his story. The accapela addition is great. If you're a fan or just want to hear a great story and listen to music at it's finest, don't miss this DVD."
2,Not at all like the name says . . .,"You will be dissapointed if you are expecting to see alot of stripping. This ""movie"" is very poorly done - the digital encoding is awful, and the sound is pitiful at best. However, I do give it two stars, one for each good reason to watch this (both are found on Tane McClure). Overall, I would say look elsewhere with your ""entertainment"" needs."
1,Awful,"this is got to be one of the worst eroctic film i ever seen, if you like films like this get stay clear of this one, it terrible. get playtime, virtual desire or secret games instead."
5,Music From Big Pink,"I wish I would have payed more attention to theseguys in the 70's,better late than never.Too bad the are almostall gone now."
5,Back to the roots,"The deluxe 180gr edition of this Capitol record is one of my favorite purchase in this years. If yo hear de cd record, you're gonna love this vinyl format"
2,Not SACD quality sound,"It could be that since I have never owned either the vinyl or standard CD versions of this I have nothing to compare it to. It is obvious this is an older recording, the sound as one person says is flat and dull. I had to go and look at the cover again to confirm this was an SACD. I have older music produced on SACD format that sounds wonderful. This does not.It sounds like it was recorded on cheap equipment in a basement. Oh, wait, it was."
4,Big Pink = Big Influence,"Have to say that this album is well worth every penny. Originally wanted it for ""The Weight"" but because so many reviewers said it was a MUST HAVE and it included 9 Bonus tracks decided to give it a go. NO regrets! This album really shows off the sound The Band created right from the start of their performing. No wonder they were back up for so many artists. The take on ""Tears of Rage"" is very different than others' recordings after this, but it stands out for the emotions in the singing that no other recording has. Love ""The Weight"", but it took me a long time to find out this was the title of what I thought was ""Take A Load off"", just shows my ignorance in the old days! ""I Shall Be Released"" is another great play, plus you have ""Long Distance Operator"", and it just goes on. This is a good introduction album and glad to add this to the collection of STANDOUT albums everyone raves about."
5,At Their Best,"This is an awesome album!I thought I knew ""The Band"" and their music but once I experienced this music I was in awe and faced the fact that all the rest was fluff compared to this effort.One would be hard pressed to find a more talented group of musicians who from very early on made it clear they were unafraid to think ""outside the box"" and explore new horizons while at the same time remaining true to their roots.This is a ""must have"" album if you are a fan of ""The Band""; if you are not currently a fan you will be once you have checked this out!"
5,Milestone American Recording,"If I was to list the twenty greatest American recordings of the twentieth century, regardless of genre, ""Music From Big Pink"" would be one of the few entries in the Rock category. There is just an indescribable, mystical and intangible beauty to this particular group of songs, that not only eclipses all of The Bands subsequent albums, but pretty much everything in Rock in the last thirty years. An understated, homey and soulful combination of American folk tradtions and good ol' rock n' roll. For curious youngsters who have read of The Band's influence on the contemporary Alt-heroes, skip the ""critics""-favorite second LP and stick with ""Big Pink""- a much more striking effort."
3,"In like, but not in love","Solid, if a bit uneven, this effort from The Band is one of rock's iconic albums. For me, I think it's fine, but this is not my favorite Band album and Music from the Big Pink doesn't match the Brown Album.This MoFi SACD is gorgeously mastered and may be worth buying, even if you're not wild about the music, just because of the sound."
4,No Cripple Creek,"I purched this cd for a friend, actually; who requested The band's greatest Hits. When I received the CD, Cripple Creek was not on it. That was one of their biggest hits. I also have to admit, that I purchased 3 CDs at the time; and I may have the confused the song title with the right cD."
3,Great music; poor CD issue.,"It's hard to believe that, while far lesser bands (the Monkees, for instance) have gotten the red-carpet treatment on their CD reissues, with remastered sound, bonus tracks, expanded booklets, etc., this seminal outfit's catalog is represented by shoddy mid-'80s vintage CD presentation.At least BIG PINK and THE BAND are still in print in the U.S., which is more than can be said for STAGE FRIGHT, or CAHOOTS, or NORTHERN LIGHTS-SOUTHERN CROSS, or (incredibly) the ACROSS THE GREAT DIVIDE box set. What on Earth is Capitol thinking?BIG PINK itself is the Band's masterpiece, and one of the absolutely essential albums in any respectable rock collection. But the CD presentation that Capitol has saddled us with merits, at best, one star. If anyone at that label is reading this--folks, an overhaul is long overdue."
5,Best band album?,"It's really tough to decide which album is best, this one or the self-titled follow-up. One of my favorite things to do is just sit back and listen to this album from start to finish, it calms me more than any anything could, and leaves me with a smile on my face every time. I can't help but think of Robbie, Richard, Levon, Garth, and Rick just making good music in the basement of big pink, jamming away and taking breaks to talk to the neighbors. I wasn't around at the time the album came out, so I can't vouch for its effect on rock, but I can definitely say that this album is nearly flawless. It has a feel unlike nearly any other album (even any other Band album), and makes me want to sing along and appreciate at the same time. It makes me nostalgic for times I never experienced. Highlights: In a Station (Richard's falsetto), Caledonia Mission, The Weight, We Can Talk, Chest Fever, etc, etc...the whole album is a masterpiece. The Band are the most underrated unit in history."
3,More old Dylan stuff,This is the album that was made from the pricrtice sessions in the Big Pink House basement tapes. Great for hard core The Band fans.
3,"It Was Mass Marketed, Hurried, but Nostalgic","Alex Ben Block, somewhat known the time, produces a hurried bio on Lee soon after his death, as Dell capitalizes on the death of Bruce and the Kung Fu craze. Block makes several terminology mistakes, which was much more common in the 70s when non-martial artists were largely ignorant of terms and definitions. This is an irritant, but nothing more.Block tries to get a ""feeling"" about Bruce Lee's pressures, the events surrounding him, and the Hong Kong movie business - here he largely succeeds. He succeeds in the Hollywood - Hong Kong connection, but largely fails in his martial arts knowledge and those circles where Bruce walked, taught, and associated in.My biggest disagreement? Block finds Return of the Dragon (Way of the Dragon)to be Lee's worse movie - it is my personal favorite."
4,Good biography,"Not your typical biography. Block gets very deeply into the history of China, religious beliefs, etc. Some of that can be boring, but it's stil ok. His in depth description of the life of the 'busy ninja' is especially interesting to read. Because this book was written far more closely to Bruce's death than many books on the life of BL, it has the most in depth review of all the autopsy's I have seen.I didn't find his review of Bruce's films on the mark all the time. There are a few interesting photos here that I haven't seen anywhere else, which was a nice bonus. When Alex Ben Block was interviewed in one of those documentaries, he really explained the BL films and the effect they had on people very well, but he didn't show too much of that attitude in the book. Still a good read."
2,Fake poster,"The poster looks nice until you notice that it's not the same image as on the album. The man on the right is standing differently, there's more flame, it's fake."
4,More practical than the Ultimate Visual Dictionary,"I bought the Ultimate Visual Dictionary 2000 and had a lot of frustration. So a few months ago I bought the Firefly Visual Dictionary and found that it's more practical (sometimes). While the former book has more compact illustrations, it's not easy to find the words in the pictues through the indexes, and many of the terms it uses is latin, rather than plain English.I read fictions and many cases I cannot picture the descriptions in the novels, and that's when I need these dictionaries most. But both dictionaries I mentioned above use latin tems more than English, and I find it's practically useless. The Firefly is a lot better in this sense. The Firefly could improve in the future versions by eliminating white spaces, reducing some repetitions. But being able to distinguish things of the same kind (e.g., dog breeds, spices, fruits) should be preserved."
4,Same Content as Macmillan Visual Dictionary,"This reference volume uses identical illustrations as the Macmillan Visual Dictionary, although it does add another five percent (or so) of additional content. The Macmillan dictionary was published in the U.S., so there are no language/translation issues with that one.Just a heads-up to those who might already own the other book, as I wish I had know this before purchasing."
5,God Is Faithful,A must for anyone who enjoys Christian music. Soothing music performed with perfect harmony. A cd that will lift your spirits and give you encouragement!
1,What am I missing?,"Attempting to give another Junie B. Jones book a try, I do not understand the lure of this series. By page nine I had read enough of the gibberish, poor grammar, and bratty behavior that Junie displays. Wanting to win at all costs is a typical 5 year old response. But is it typical to call your Grandfather a ""sucker"" - an odd word choice. This book does not reflect the articulate, caring, and yes sometimes misbehaving kindergartners I've encountered. Junie's portrayed personality traits seem out of control and negative in so many ways. Not a recommended chapter book choice for young readers."
1,shaquel m,The very first reason why i like this book is because she is smart and got a smart mouth.How she smart and got a smart mouth is because when she's at school she does what ever thers at school she got to do in class and in the office and pluse she sray in the office and she stay in trouble with that mouth of her's on her face.
1,poor grammar - bad language - no thanks!,i wish someone had warned me about this series. my 5 year old reader loves these books - but they are difficult for him to read because of the irregular grammar. Our kids get enough of the stupid/dumb/shut-up - the last place i want to deal with these words is reading time.
4,Good plot,A very good plot. The writing was slow. This was not a page burner but worth reading to the end.
3,Not Grisham,"The plot was not credible: a diabolically evil politician's wife arranging for multiple murders to cover-up husband's past and to further his career. It is a readable dramatic book but the ending wrapped up too quickly and unbelievably neatly. It is worth reading but certainly not of Grisham caliber, as another review wrote."
2,Not a bad start,"This helping from the author is a bit all over the place. Our author needs a crash course on some literary devices, such as chapters. This looks like a self-published effort and in that regard it's not too bad but it cries out for a good editor. The continuity in the action scenes needs a lot to be desired."
4,A worthy read.,Great plot. Interesting characters. A page turner. When I finished Lying In State I was reccommending it to everyone I knew.
4,Well written Book,I liked the story line with all the twists and turns.The ending shows that in time everything comes full circle
4,Good Book - Silly Ending,I really liked this book until I got near the end. The ending was just a little too much for me. This book is also a good example of why a professional editor is kind of important. A lot of silly little mistakes that a 3rd party could have caught.
4,More true than the Kennedy Conspiracy,"First of all it is South Florida, history tells us you can rape in a seaside mansion, rig national elections or even stay out of prison after 10 billion in fradulent real estate loans. So what could possibly not happen here?"
3,Lying is State...,"It's a rather slow read......but some interesting background into US politics. Wish it ""hung together a little more. I am only 1/2 way through, maybe pace will change later."
1,WOPR Rules,"This is not only a bad sequel, but a cheap, nonsense movie.The only good scene is when WOPR appears in the back.If you liked the original movie with Matthew Broderick, you are not going to like this one."
2,Just terrible...,"The original war game was plausible due to its simplicity. David hacked a computer and it started a game. End of story.This one, tracking terrorists via video games, is just ridiculous.Aside from the opening sequence, a waste of time."
4,I'm suprised...,"This was actually a pretty good movie. Not sure why it didn't get advertised more. If you loved the original, then you'll like this one as well."
1,"No, no, no, no, no....","How can a studio have such a wonderful product to build upon, and screw it up so badly? The original War Games was filled with wonderful, sympathetic HUMAN characters, funny moments amid the rising drama, and a wonderful sense of pace and build. The Dead Code has NONE of this, substituting MTV-like editing, suspense-free drama, and amoral characters who you want to slap from the first moment. How to count the wrongs? The ""Bimbo Bomb"" at the very beginning? The completely inept chase scene where speeding cars CANNOT catch up with the on-foot suspects? The mother character who is introduced, and then dropped like a lead brick? The final scene which does nothing more than copy the original message? The non-existent chemistry between the two leads? The only good parts of this film are when they bring back elements from the original film, but those pleasures are few and far between. This one is awful from the word go. Watch the original instead."
2,Both a remake and a sequel?,This film holds the distinction of being the only film I have ever seen which seems to be both a remake and a sequel at once. It is presented as a sequel to the original 1983 WarGames in that it builds upon events which transpired in the original film. It comes across as a remake in that Dead Code essentially warms over the plot of the original substituting modern elements into the same storyline with an identical ending.The many subtle references to the original film are commendable. Making a sequel with essentially the same plot and ending as the original is not. Dead Code is hardly a worthy successor to the classic original.
2,Blech,"One star would be too low as it had two redeeming moments, but I'm comfy with two stars. A straight to DVD film - it's obvious why it made no sense to release it to theatres. They tried to take the original film, and update the politics and technology, but didn't pull it off. A couple good ideas in the script, and a couple of good moments, but they're outnumbered by a hundred bad ideas. The ending stole too much from the original. If you loved the original then just keep your expectations low and you'll have a good time. If you're on any kind of budget, the only winning move is not to press play.GREETINGS PROFESSOR FALKEN."
5,Justice: New and Selected Poems,"Donald Justice expresses himself powerfully through an economy of words. His poignant ideas and feelings penetrate his highly structured poetic forms and rhyming schemes without seeming stilted or academic. In accepting the formal and rather out-of-mode forms of poetry, he could compare to painters Sargent or Whistler."
3,Not A 3-D Book,"I had bought this book expecting it to be an astronomy/space 3D book with lots of cool 3D pictures. However a ""cool"" 3D graphic book was not what I got. This book is a heavy, college level text book. The 3D glasses that come with the book are for a couple of stereoscopic line drawings that are in the book.Just want to send this warning out to anyone who thinks they may be buying a 3-D book."
1,Mercedes-Benz 250 1968-1972 by Autobooks/VelocePress,"Don't waste your time or money. Editorial review is a joke, ""invaluable"", come on this book has missing information that is even in the owners manual. This book is incoherent, it is loaded with typos and most of all, this book considers the Explanation of a system or component to be a repair guide. Utterly useless."
5,Nice extension kit,Always been happy with Kleenbore products and this is not exception. I wanted an extra handle and some extensions and this was a good buy.
2,Longgun Cleaning Pad; it won't last longg,"The Drymate Gun Cleaning Pad purports they are ""America's #1 Selling Gun Pad"". Made in the US of 50% recycled fiber, and machine washable, the cleaning pad seems to make rather inflated claims. Measuring at a mere 3-4 mm thick, the gun pad is hardly lush. It appears to be constructed of a chintzy polyester felt with an even more miniscule plasticized backing. While it might protect the surface from minor drips or spills the Drymate pad is unlikely to provide adequate cushioning or surface protection. The thin plasticized backing is neither slippery nor tacky and while it lays reasonably flat and doesn't slide excessively, it hardly grips. I doubt this pad will last long or hold up to repeated washings. Compared to other products, this pad is on the cheap side and is an indication as to why ""Made in America"" is no longer a sign of quality. Think of cheap felt glued to a plastic bag."
1,Cheap,"I got this to take to the range, it is very long which is nice, however it is poorly made. The material is very thin and has a light plastic backing that will not hold up over the long term and forget about washing this, it won't make it. I had to return mine as it was ripped.I don't recommend unless you just need something to lay your shotgun/rifle on but nothing more.Vidimo Se!"
2,"Borrow, don't buy","Very elementary, could have been written by anyone; including a priest. No ""blow you away"" secrets here. All common sense, with a couple of stupid tips to make sure you get arrested, such as approaching police in other countries and bribing them to find cocaine sources. Thought it would be an interesting read of an experienced trafficker, instead it was a short, ""thrown together"" book of common sense. Almost unreadable, don't buy it. All the 5 star reviews here are most definitely friends, or the author himself."
3,too big,"this product was made sturdy and arrived quickly, however it was too large for my babygate. it did not fit. the plastic pieces that attach the screws to the wall also did not fit this product. Hopefully returning it will be painless."
2,Unglued,"When brush arrived, the top metal portion that holds the bristles together had come unglued from the wood handle. I glued it back together instead of dealing with the hassle of returning or exchanging it."
4,Works well,This brush works great but I think I would have been ok just purchasing the Buki brush alone. I don't really think I needed this one but got it because Bare Minerals recommended it.
4,Great,Works find and seems to be the same as ones sold at BE Boutiques. Pretty satisfied with the product overall. Very light and airy on your face.
2,Not so awesome,"I'm not a fan at all of Bare Escentual brushes. They always feel harsh on my skin, shed like nobodys business and I tend to get poor coverage from them as a result. So generally I go buy brushes from the body shop instead. This is especially true of their kabuki brush, so if you hate that one I suggest you pick upThe Body Shops version, you'll be much happier with it.The exception is their maximum coverage concealer brush. That brush is why their brushes get two stars instead of one, because they have never impressed me.Pros-- Their concealer brushCons-- Almost all of their other brushes are average or poor when compared to Grocery store brushes(to be fair there are some that I haven't tried)- Shed a lot- Are very poky and often hurt to use- Don't give you even coverage"
1,mini brush not normal sized! what a rip off!,this brush would take me and hour to apply a full face of foundation with. its not the normal sized one its about 4 inches long... you can get a full sized one on amazon for the same price. dont waste your time or money
1,There are too many other companies.,"If you actually expect to get your product after ordering and paying for it, then dont order here!!"
3,Not as good as the original.,"I had my original BA brush that came with a starter kit a few years back, which was wonderful! After daily use, it wore out and the idea of spending $20+ on a simple brush is, let's face it, ludicrous. This brush, however, feels more synthetic and doesn't result in as smooth of an application as the original. I guess you get what you pay for..."
4,soft brush!,"I bought this brush to apply the bare minerals foundation. It's a soft brush, so it doesn't scratch my face.. and it applies the foundation really well. I love it and couldn't ask for anything more with the way it applies the foundation. The only problem that bothers me is that it comes with no case.. so I'm always worried that the hairs will split apart and it wont last for a long time. Other than that, I'm very satisfied!"
1,Not like the BE brushes bought in store,"I purchased a set of brushes as a backup for when I clean the first set I got (handi buki, flawless face and full coverage face). These brushes were not the same as the ones I purchased from the Bare Escentuals section at Ulta the week before. The handi buki is smaller, hard and the bristles do shed like made. The other two brushes are also harder and shed a lot in comparison to the brushed purchased in store. None of them apply the product as well as the good ones. It did not apply the foundation nearly as well as the original. It is horrible. I will go to Ulta and purchase a new proper set so I wasted my money here.The name printed on the side of these brushes is id Bare Escentuals. The GOOD brushes bought in store do not have the ""id"" on them. This makes me wonder if these brushes are not genuine?FYI the real BE brushes available at Ulta are fantastic."
2,the brush is flawed,ok the reson is that when i first used this brush some of the fibers were all of my face i love the look and size but why are the fibers coming loose
1,brush scratches your skin,"The skin on my face has been hurting. I thought I had too much sun, or using the wrong new SPF lotion. After reading these reviews, I realize the brush from BARE ESCENTUALS is the culprit. My skin feels raw and it hurts when I wash it.I am very disappointed with the quality of the brush."
3,It's just okay...,"I usually love all things Bare Escentuals but this brush is mediocre at best. I purchased it to replace an inexpensive one that I had been using for a few years. With all the hype this brush gets I was expecting a much softer, smoother and precise application. This brush just doesn't deliver."
1,Bristles keep falling out!,"This was a total waste of money - I've had it a week and the bristles are falling out all over the place. I thought maybe it would get better after a few days, but no luck. I don't know - perhaps this is not the real thing because the first Bare Minerals brush I owned (that I replaced with this one) was fine for almost a year before it started shedding."
1,Not as good as the brand,"I love bareMinerals and their makeup has changed my life, but this brush, made me change my clothes after using it! There were bristles ALL over me and my shirt. I had to bend over to apply the wonderful foundation in the hopes of it not shedding all over my chest and shirt. I do not recommend this brush, however, the foundation and makeup are marvelous!"
5,Great product,I love Bare Escentuals makeup and this brush makes it go on much smoother. This brush is identical to the brushes you'd buy at the Bare Escentuals store.
5,concealer brush works wonders,"i don't know how they do it, but this brush works wonders! no need to buy a different concealer, just use your regular bare escentuals foundation and use this brush for touch up areas. great deal online vs buying in the store, but either way, worth the cost."
2,Scratchy!,"Pros:Good for blush or bronzorCons:ScratchyDidn't retain shape after washingDoesn't deposit enough foundationThis came in the starter kit I got as a gift and it sucks. I only use it for blush, which it actually distributes well. It distributes the power foundation terribly. The only reason why it got a 2 is because it actually got softer after I washed it so it wasn't nearly as scratchy, but it did lose some of its shape: it became more fanned out and less dense."
2,Itchy,This foundation brush is just not for me. When the representative at Macy's put the foundation on my face with this brush my face felt itchy and I didn't know why. So I bought the $60 starter kit for my sister for Christmas and I tried the brush on my fce without foundation and it just isn't as soft as I want and it made my face itch. It's fine for my sister who I bought it for. Idk maybe I just have sensitive skin and need really soft stuff. I use ecotools and they r uber soft and don't bother my skin.
3,not as expected,"This brush is labeled as a full flawless face brush however, it is not nearly as full as the one I have at home that I was replacing.It is not that it is just not as full, it is actually shaped slightly different and therefore has about 70% less bristles than the brush I expecting to receive."
5,love this brush!,Great price for the brush! My daughter and I love this brush. Its good to conceal as well as eye makeup.
4,love the brush hate the price,"I loved the brush it is kinda small because i mistakenly thought it was the heavenly face brush but until i received it realized that is the ""blush"" brush and it could have gotten that one at the website for $9.50 instead of $12. But again that is my fault for not paying attention.. I used it for contouring my face along with some coastal scents palettes and i loved it.."
1,how to turn middle school students off to science,Just wanted to agree wholeheartedly with the other one star review for this book. Book is comprehensive in scope but is REALLY difficult to read and comprehend! Not written at all at the level it is designed to educate.
1,Heavy Duty water Blade,"I bought this product as a replacement for one that I had happily used for many years. Unfortunately, the quality-control inspection on this unit did not catch the manufacturing defects in this one, specifically the fact that the edge of the blade was uneven, but wavy, and the composition of the blade itself was nonuniform. The result is a blade that leaves large amounts of water on a surface and produces a very loud sound when used. I highly recommend the purchase of this product only after physically inspecting one in a retail store for straightness and flexibility of the blade."
1,Disappointing!,The heavy duty California waterblade was a total disappointment! I have had several of the regular ones and they were wonderful...soft and pliable and removed water from my windows with little or no streaking. The heavy duty blade was stiff and made a horrible screeching sound as it was pulled across a window surface. And it left major streaks!! I returned it!
3,Not a squeegee...,"I bought this because it was on sale and less expensive than the smaller blades. It is really too big for my purposes--too large for the car or shower. Perhaps with experience, I will become more adept at using it. It doesn't work well for cleaning windows. I have too many streaks.I wish that I had bought a smaller blade."
3,The California Blade holder looses its Grip,The California Blade does an excellent job by itself. The extendable blade holder simply fails to securely hold the blade. The blade slips from side to side in the holder. I have not yet taken the time to fatten up the blade so that the holder will not allow the blade to slide around inside the bracket. I purchased the product for use on the inside of tall glass shower doors after use of the shower. The Blade handles the job admirably.
1,Horribly overpriced! Order carefully!,"Never before, in years of purchases at Amazon, have I ever actually returned an item until I purchased this book (and its companion). ($) dollars is WAY too much to charge. I bought this for my 10 year old son, but the content is skimpy and mostly drawings. There is at most a paragraph or two on a page, with huge text and lots of white space. This is more like an essay paper than a book. Thanks but no thanks...I'll take my ($) back!"
5,Amazing stragey and control,"This game really makes you feel like your ahead of a special forces team. Great training program to get you started with the (at first) difficult commands. Once you get the hang of it's amazing fun. The game does not last very long but you get into some fun challenges. And those specially located tanks are always annoying but very reliveing once you blow them up.The thing I liked most about this game is your ability to heal a member when their down. You don't have all the time in the world to do so but it makes the level progression go back and forth.Co-Op features are the real heart of this, getting four people to move about in these levels all working together is just great.Replay value is not the highest but is always worth it, I highly recommend this game."
5,noodles,"I have purchased this product three times. It is very good. A tangy, spicy flavor. The noodles not too thick, not too thin. You can add meat or vegetables and have a delicious meal."
5,Less salty than ramen noodles,"I like this product because it seems to be less salty and probably has less MSG than normal ramen noodles. You are supposed to cook this with less water, and therefore less soup but I still make it like ramen and like it that way. It tastes different than ramen noodles yet is more satisfying to me."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this batman costume for my 2 year old (toddler size), and was so excited to get it in the mail. When I opened it up, I was so disappointed, the costume was so horribly put together. There is string hanging off every seam, I'm afraid to cut it as the whole costume might unravel. When my son tried it on, his arms barely fit in the sleeves and he is by no means a fat child (in fact he's pretty slim), I have no idea how we are going to fit a sweatshirt on him under the costume...The muscle chest part doesn't lay flat to his chest and puffs out so much so I can't velcro the back of his costume together. And my son refuses to wear the cape/mask because he velcro on the cape scratches his neck, and he can't see out of the mask. I'm honestly debating whether or not I should send back the costume or just try to fix these issues myself (i.e. sewing it correctly) and making it work for my kid.I would not recommend buying this costume."
1,No muscles on the chest?,"This may seem like a small thing to some, but my son specifically wanted this costume because it had the built-in muscles unlike other costumes. We just received it today and the front is 100% flat as if it was compressed during storage and has no muscles, it's just a flat piece of thicker foam basically. Not only does it look awkward because it's so flat, but it is really a let down for the price paid.Come on Amazon, do some quality control before you send things out :("
2,Costume too big,"This costume runs bigger than the true sizing, therefore my grandson was unable to wear and enjoy it on xmas day. Other than that the quality was comparable to any other costume like this."
3,Nice costume but watch the sizing,"I purchased this costume for my 8 year old and to be on the safe size I bought the 10-12 which is a size Large. The costume fits him fine on the body, (which to me says that they run small in the body part of the costume, he's not heavy at all,) yet the costume is super long. I had to shorten the costume quite a bit. And he's by no means a short boy. So be aware of this.Also, the Mask with attached cape is of a very small size. The cape is long and fine but the attached face mask only comes down to his forehead. I'm wondering if the cape and mask are of a one size fits all type. So, I will have to do some work to make the mask fit or buy him another cheap mask to go with the costume.Overall, for the price, the costume is of an ok quality but the sizing seems to have some major issues. Just be aware of this when you order."
1,"A Sizing Disaster, lousy cape, missing utility belt","I spent a lot of time trying to decide between this size and the ""toddler"" size. Ordered the confusing size ""medium 8-10"" for age 5-7. However, it actually is sized for age 8-10 I think. My son is a pretty tall 6 yr old, so this was way off. The yellow utility belt that the package is supposed to have was missing. The cape was attached to the head mask and the ears do not stick up but lie flat against the head. The only thing that was ""good"" about this costume was the muscle chest. However, I do not recommend this product. Would not buy it again even if it fit correctly."
3,A great value,Nice costume for the price of $10.00. Only recommendation would be to make the muscle chest plate more flexible and not so stiff.
2,Wrong Item,"This costume was sent to me as the standard costume. NOT the muscle chest version of the costume, which costs more. Returning it is not worth the hassle though."
2,Way to big for an 8 year old an adult can wear a boys size 8,the suits nice but i was fooled on sizes my son is half the size of the suit and he is 6. i hope he likes it big!
5,Great Costume,I got this for my three-year-old for Halloween. I wasn't expecting much as previously purchased costumes were cheaply made and skimpy. I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase. The costume is constructed to hold-up under regular wear/play sessions and it doesn't look cheap. I would definitely recommend this!
4,My son loved it.,"My son was very excited to wear this costume, the chest piece was large which makes it difficult to play in (I thought it would be soft stuffing). Overall, pleased with this purchase!"
3,Muscles flat from storage?,"I received this product and it was mostly as advertised. The biggest problem was the plastic chest muscle piece was flat and did not give the disarmed effect. My six year old didn't notice, but it was a disappointment to me. The Robin costume I ordered for his little brother arrived and was in great shape, showing how poor the Batman costume really was."
4,HALLOWEEN WAS A HIT!,"My son looked absolutely adorable in this costume. He got a lot of compliments everywhere he went in it. The best part were the built in muscles! My only complaint is that the costume stains easily and is difficult to wash because it is hand wash only. If I could put it in the wash that would have been great. Overall, however, this costume is worth it!"
4,Son liked it.,"7 year old liked it, held up well for Halloween, but he's also worn it about 5-6 times just for costume play in the house, so cute. Probably higher quality than most costumes you get for Halloween."
5,Costume review,"Product was in excellent, new condition. Reasonably priced and arrived quickly. Would buy from again. Thanks!"
2,Not what I was expecting,I've seen other Batman muscle outfits that were a lot nicer looking/feeling. This one relies a lot on cardboard which is weird looking and somewhat uncomfortable for my child.
4,Pretty good,"This is a little big for my 3 year old, as the muscles are made of a plastic material and doesn't really bend. It will fit soon enough though. He loves it."
2,Not what I expected.,"Those of us who are familiar with little kid costumes probably know the typical super hero costume with cotton that gives that faux appearance of muscles. This batman costume looks like it should have the cotton but it doesn't. Instead it is a board under the material that gives it that look. It is awkward and not as good as it could have been had it been made the other way.Also the cape is connected to the mask which makes it so that if the cape gets stuck or stepped on it will yank the head back. Definitely needs to be re-designed with kids and practicality in mind. My son loves batman so I couldn't return it because I didn't want to disappoint him, but he didnt wear the mask/cape at all during trick or treating. Not ok."
2,COULD BE BETTER INFORMATION!,NICE PHOTOS OF PAINTINGS BUT NOT MUCH INFORMATION FOR ARTISTS. JUST GENERAL THINGS THAT WE ALREADY SHOULD KNOW .
2,Not worth your time,This book gives very little help and actually your common sense is just as good. I am an artist and it did NOT help me at all.
2,NOTHING I DID NOT ALREADY KNOW,"IF YOU TAKE THE TIME TO WRITE A BOOK, IT SHOULD CONTAIN CONSTRUCTIVE AND INSTUCTIONAL MATERIAL. THIS BOOK HAS NETHER ONE AND I HOPE TO FIND BOOKS WITH MUCH MUCH BETTER INFORMATION. HOPE THIS HELPS PEOPLE NOT WASTE THEIR MONEY."
2,the 5 essentials in every powerful painting,book arrived damaged because of poor packaging. notified seller but heard nothing.very dissaponting.regards dawn
5,this is the best song george has ever recorded,"i'm a musician and big time george fan. without a doubt in my mind, your looking at his next #1"
1,Boring and Callous,"This song shows no sensitivity at all! Normally, I really like George Strait, but this song just makes me feel sick. Whenever I hear it, I find myself in the woman who 'sparkles and glitters' shoes, who loves a man who always has another woman in his mind when he's holding her. Plus, the tune puts me to sleep."
5,These guys rawk!,"Absolutely incredible band. I just got turned on to these guys. Money well spent. If you like your rock Southern and your blooze jumpy, this disc is for you. ""Dead Horse"" is a rawkin' song in the Stones vein. ""Back to the Bottle"" and ""Jammin' Down Southern"" have great slide work. And ""Black Cat's Path"" has great riffs. If you wanna hear how good this guy is with a slide, check out their version of ""Mean Old World"" on their website."
5,"The Daughters of Bast ""The Hidden Land""","This book is one that a person cannot afford to pass up. Sarah Isidore does a terrific job of combining history with fantasy. The characters portrayed in this book really makes you feel as if you know them, like they are one of your best friends. The cat-Mau- is a great character, and has an attitude that fits a cat. I cannot express how good this good this book truly is, so anyone reading this review, please go out and buy this great book. Again, Sarah is probably one of the best authors I have read, and with anticipation I await to buy the sequel! God bless"
5,Written from the heart!,"This book will amaze you, make you laugh, smile, cry, and giggle all at the same time. Truly a gem when it comes to capturing the beauty of the Newfoundland breed of dog. If you own a Newfoundland, Ninety Nine Newfies is a must for your collection. Even if you don't own a Newf, this book is an entertaining and joyful reading experience!"
1,What?,"Ok so if you want to watch Juvenile get drunk and eat chicken, then this is the movie for you."
1,Big Typo in the Title,"Please be aware of the major boo-boo found in this title here. Asus builds graphics cards with NVIDIA chips, and they build graphics cards with ATI chips. Both NVIDIA and ATI do a great job and produce first-class chips, but just in case you want to stick with one or the other, let's get something straight here. The 9200SE is manufactured by ATI, not NVIDIA (as advertised in the title). I'm guessing the advertised product here is a ATI product, but if they can get the manufacturer's name wrong, who's to say they didn't get the chip name wrong. Perhaps this product hosts a NVIDIA chip. Then which one?"
4,Simple but fun,"The fourth doctor's advantures always seem to involve more fun then other doctors. Don't know if this flows from them being written with Tom Baker in mind or if it's just a coincidence. This is another fun one. Nothing too complicated (although of course the Doctor saves the Earth again), but an entertaining read. The Doctor is assisted quite well by Sarah in this one as they blunder into and attempt to foil a plot to conquer the Earth by the evil Kraal's.Not a complicated plot but a quick read and pretty enjoyable. Do not expect lots of character development or deep thoughts, just read it for fun.Enjoy!"
5,Well-written account of Japan at its most misunderstood,"Ruth Keyso writes a fascinating account of the lives of nine different Okinawan women. Her book reads like seperate memoirs, yet each is tied together by the common thread of devastation and beauty, sadness and truth. These lives offer a personal glimpse into a culture that is dominated by the American military presence that has existed on their island for over 50 years, yet has managed to maintain ties to the Okinawa of the past. The book explores for the first time lives that seem to have disappeared from history books, and allows the reader to have a glimpse into the human side of war and its aftermath. The only criticism I would have for this book is that it was not written before. These stories need to be heard--they are long overdue."
5,A must read,"I just finished this book. As a female, African-American/Japanese stationed on Okinawa for the last four years I really enjoyed this book. Okinawan history from a woman's perspective was truly a story that needed to be told. I wasn't interested in the history of Okinawa until I went on a local base tour of the battle of Okinawa last year. It opened my eyes to the treatment of the Okinawans from the Japanese. My heart goes out to these wonderful people. I have a better understanding on how the Okinawans feel about our presence here on their island and what war means to them.I am going to recommend this book to all my friends, American and Okinawan.Thanks for the story Miss Keyso."
1,i think i should be able to hear the whole song,that's very unfair that i don't even get a chance to hear the whole song also that the song wasn't even avabile. i am a fan of keith sweat and i rate it a one because i could't hear it i think i'll go to another web page to find my main man
1,"BAD ZIPPERS, don't waste your money!!","The overall features and construction of this pack is worthy of 5 stars. However, the bag is useless because of very low quality zippers. The zippers are so bad, that the large compartment zipper failed the first time it was used. Quality bags, have quality, heavy duty zippers. The zippers on this bag aren't worthy for a pair of jeans.But if you want a nice bag that won't zip up, this one is for you!"
3,Bill's rarest recordings - and even overdubbed.,"It's not easy to get hold of Bill Haley's Orfeon/Dimsa recordings, especially in Europe. This cheap double-CD is a fine collection including the famous ""Florida Twist"". Sad but true: All the tracks have been overdubbed to give them a more modern feel. That could sound dreadful, but they did a fairly good job."
1,Los Angeles native - not happy with purchase,"I am a Los Angeles native and I found this book to be very difficult to use and with very little useful information. If there is too much information in California to include enough information about a site, perhaps LP shouldn't publish the title. Listing every potential site without adequate information is not helpful.I have used the LP Turkey, Bali, and Greece books, and while I think most of the problem with this book stems from LP's confusing and cluttered format (which was a problem for those books as well), this book was less useful for my California traveling than those other books were, although I cannot put my finger on why that is.I am thinking of getting the Fodor's guide instead. From what I have seen on Amazon's preview, Fodor's format looks like it is more user friendly. If only Rick Steve's published a California guide."
5,Very Useful,"Have a few of the Lonely Planet series, always tells you the hidden gems, a summary of what to do and has great maps. Glad be bought this for a work/mini vacation on my first trip to Cali"
5,very good,"There is very good information about attractions and money saving places recommended. On just one nights stay, we saved enough to pay for the book. Amazon was very prompt with shipping."
3,"OK, but loud","I bought this with my custom PC and in fact I am typing on it right now. It's good and tough; I've dropped the keyboard and mouse a few times while moving. The mouse was hard to click at first but after a while I didn't notice. I have to say my biggest pet pev with this keyboard is the fact the keys are REALLY LOUD!!! I have friends who are light on keyboards and even they made a whole lot of noise. In a dorm room it bothers people. I play online games with voice chat and they can hear this thing. Even in a phone call the person on the other end comments about the volume. My pev with the mouse is how the plastic covering collects dirt under it. The keyboard all so becomes dusty quickly and I am the type of person to wash my hands all the time, and does not eat over my keys. I have to say if loud keys aren't a problem for you then this is a fine keyboard/mouse comb."
3,Sockets don't fit,Great concept but poor execution. The holes in the center of many of my sockets were too small to fit on the Hansen Socket Tray. I had to return them. Hansen needs to specify that the posts are designed to fit sockets with an interior hole diameter of xx inches/mm or greater.
5,History of the AFL,This is a great pictorial history of the greatest football league ever formed. History will show that a freakish number of great players came from this upstart league.
3,+1/2 A worthy addition to the modern Nashville sound,"This is one of those immaculate, perfectly crafted modern Nashville albums that makes you shake your head and marvel at how the corniest formulas and cheesiest production can still pull you in, even when you can't stand the style... To his credit, McCoy's rich, resonant vocals are a big part of the success... From the opening notes, it's clear he's matured as a singer and grown into his voice. A couple of these songs are just too awful for even him to pull it off (notably the super-sappy power ballads, ""Only You"" and ""Completely"") but others may provoke an unwilling smile, such as the clever, classic ""That's Not Her,"" and the old-fashioned ""Life Of The Party."" Nothing earthshaking, but still an album that shows him a worthy heir to the '70s countrypolitan tradition."
4,When life seems more than you can bear...listen to this.,"Sometimes life gets real heavy. When it gets like that I pop in this CD, turn up the player and start singing along. There is just the right mix of songs, sentimental, fast, slow, just plain ol' happy. I enjoy every song on this CD...but Lipstick on the Radio and Strongest Man in the World are my favorites. You know, they say if you're feel blah, or blue, or restless you should get up and move. With Neal's CD playing you'll have plenty to dance to! Thanks Neal for the smile in my spirit when I listen to this."
5,"Old Friends, Gaither VHS",Great video and it came very quickly. It is in great shape. Nothing was wrong with the video and I'm enjoying it very much.
5,Beautiful bracelets-amazing service,"Got my wristbands in 2 days.Top quality, very beautiful bracelets.Operation Homefront does a very good job for military families all over the USA."
5,A must have,"I wish I could have all of the ""REMASTERED CDs"" that have been released now and perhaps one day I will. But this was the first one I got which started off my Ravi Shankar collection. This is an excellent CD because it gives you five completely different raags including a ""dhun"" and a ""thumri"" style. What is great about these old recordings is that Panditji has condensed every raag in a shorter version of a fully blown concert which is usually about an hour long.Listening to Puriya Dhanashri one is automatically taken to an evening setting. My favourite in this CD is the raag ""Charu Keshi"" I haven't experienced such a beautiful introduction to a raag, there is so much in the first five or six seconds of this piece that I could hear just that again and again.If you hear any poor digital remastering, you are not paying attention."
5,A Masterpiece,"I have almost all of the cd's in the Ravi Shankar collection. And this is by far my favorite. Most of the disc is up-tempo, so it's not a album for meditation. This cd has alot of energy and Chatur Lal on tabla is amazing. This one's a mainstay in my cd player."
4,An Avid Reader,"a fairly compelling historical romance. It's the third book in the 'Our' series after Our Lizzie and Our Polly, but it's an interesting read on it's own. It's fairly obvious from the beginning that the two main characters will get to together, that being the bases for any good romance, but the author throws in a few twists along the way."
3,Ok LED Flashlight,"I use to really like maglite flashlights, but I starting to think I do not like the twist to turn on or off function. I think a push button would really work better. Sometimes does not twist on due to the back portion where you drop the batteries in has come lose and has to be tightned in order to get it to work."
5,Great little flashlight,"I own an older mag mini that I upgraded with an LED light. This flashlight is so much better!!! It is very bright and the beam is adjustable. You can select full bright, low light, flashing and even a programed S.O.S!!! Mag products are just better."
5,Great lite,"These AA LED flashlights are so much brighter than the old AAA mini mags we had, it's unbelievable. But it's true!!"
4,Bad News - Can't Use Rechargables,"Didn't note this in other reviews (may have missed it)- but you are not supposed to use rechargable NiMh batteries in this LED flashlight due to possible damage to the LED module. Bummer!!! NiMh have 3 times the capacity in AA size and recharge quickly.I also have noticed that leaving the flashlight standing on the lens end, it is quite unstable due to its small diameter. Laying it down on anything not perfectly level, it will roll off. I taped on a short piece of toothpick to stop the roll.Does produce a very bright light and feels very durable."
4,Maglite mini led,"I bought this for my husband, he loves it. Other flashlights were never bright enough for what he needed."
3,Nice quality but focusing not as good as non-LED version,"The build quality is good, made in USA, good quality switch and seals.Focusing for the LED version of the mini Maglite is a disappointment. In the non-LED version, the beam may be focused to a sharp point, with a very dim halo. In the LED version, focusing only makes a brighter spot in the middle, surrounded by a bright halo. This makes the LED unit unsuitable for looking inside electronic component chassis, holes, crevices, and so forth. The brighter halo of the LED unit reflects back from the surrounding area and blinds the eyes.However, the LED unit is fine for typical usage where a wide and bright beam is helpful, such as looking inside a car glove box, inside the trunk, on a floor, and so forth.The LED flashlight is a bit longer than the non-LED version, still fine for storing in a car glove box."
1,Horrible,"Horrible junk. Switch fails more than it works. Tried 2 of these before I gave up on them completely. I use it for work and find myself having to twist, twist, shake, etc. Don't do it. Mag has sunken to mediocrity."
1,disappointing,"I expected a better flashlight, given my experience with the older non-LED versions. The flashlight supposedly has a number of modes (flashing, dim, bright), but in practice the twist control is too hard to use in any mode except bright. The focusing is poor, there is a large black spot in the center of the beam. Wait until they develop a better product."
1,Piece of Junk,"I like the features when I did some research and the fact they're not made in China like most of the LED flashlights out in the market. It had great intensity and worked well until the switch started to intermitently misfire then not light up anymore, not even through the 1st set of batteries. I bought 2 and both went bad after about 2 months. I'm sending them back to Mag Instrument for warranty repairs and hope they fixed the problem. I would not recommend this light to anyone, not even my worst enemy."
2,"Not a reliable flashlight, surprised!","I was very excited for this flashlight because I've never had a mag lite before and L.E.D. bulbs take almost nothing out of the batteries and I always remembered Mag Lite was a reliable and trusted brand of flashlite.That's why I was surprised when I had to continually beat this thing in order to get it to work. When you need a flashlight, you don't want these problems leaving you in the dark. Stay away from this unit."
1,Not as endurable as older maglite,"As soon as I purchased this maglite it did not perform well; it cut off, or flashed intermittently. I sent an email to Maglite about the problem but never heard from them. Finally, after a year of sporadic use the light gave out altogeter. After putting new batteries in it the light flared blue and then quit. I again sent a note to Maglite and was told to send the light and a check for $7.00 to the factory and it would be repaired. I chose not to do so because I could have purchased a new one for the total I would be paying.Although I've always had good service from Maglite I am considering a different brand because I do not feel that Maglite stands behind their product enough. I would not recommend this light.Yatta Jacob"
5,I am impressed,I bought this because I was looking for a replacement for my incandecent version of the mini mag. The old one I had for at least 10 years and the reflector was cracked and most of the paint had worn off. It still works but I decided to give the led mini mag a try and boy was I blown away by this light. Its severly brighter than my old one. The package says the batteries on high will last 10 hours but I tested it and I got 14 hours off of 1 pair of batteries. I am now using rechargeable batteries in it and I can get at least 10 hours on high.
2,I've Had Nothing But Trouble With This Light,"I've had this flashlight for over two years. I use it as a backup light, because it's so obnoxious, yet i can't stand the idea of throwing it away. It doesn't put out a real strong beam by today's standard of LED flashlight, but that isn't such a big deal. The battery compartment threads on mine wiggle loose frequently, and the multi-mode switch is terribly annoying when the light goes off and on on its own accord. I'm constantly fighting it for a steady beam of light when i use it."
4,"Handy, but just slightly lacking","After using this for a few months, I've got to say I couldn't imagine a better mix of reliable and convenient. It treats my rechargeable batteries well and provides a lot of light for It's size. Three only real issue is how easy it is to scratch the lens. I treat it relatively well but it still is a little worse of than moderately cloudy. If you buy it I would consider coating the lens with something to compensate."
4,Works and fits great...,I bought this to put into my BMW motorcycle. This fits perfectly in the door up front. There is a little clip for it. It is very solid and bright. No complaints.
3,"Handy, portable and nice size","A flashlight has one main function--to enable you to see in the dark. There are cheaper lights that will light your way so why this one? It depends on what you need it for. I bought this for two reasons: 1) the need for a light when I take photos in the darkness or inside buildings where the light is poor, 2) the size and weight make this ideal for my camera bag which already has too much in it.For me this light serves a purpose very well. The beam is strong and can be focused on a particular item. It is hardy and light. It comes with a nice protective case and seems well constructed. I really like it and maybe you will too."
1,Worst Maglite ever.,"I hate this flashlight. I use a small flashlight at work, probably 12 times a day. I went to this flashlight because it was supposed to be brighter and the batteries were supposed to last longer. I admit the light is brighter, but that only last a couple of days because this flashlight goes through batteries in less than two weeks. I am now going back to the halogen to save on batteries."
1,a complete dud,"Not really all that bright. annoying to turn on as you keep getting 25% mode, blink mode, or SOS mode, or some other idiot mode nobody wants. how about ON, and OFF? after 3 days somehow wound up staying on and killing the batteries. I threw it away. Don't buy unless they pay you $50 to take it. then keep the $50 and throw the POS away."
2,Bright but hate SOS feature,"I am pleased with the brightness of this flash lite, but the twisting of the head to get it to just stay on, and not start the stupid flashing on and off, drives me nuts! I have an old mini Mag lite which I retrofitted to led, and although it is not as bright, it at least does not start flashing on and off whether or not I want it to. The flashing feature really is extremely irritating! I use rechargeable batteries in my mini mags. This head twist one will work okay for just a little while but when the batteries begin to lose the least bit of charge it commences with the bloody flashing. My old retrofitted one just gets dim."
4,Pretty dang good for the price!,"I recently bought the 3AA version of this 3 Watt LED Maglite. I'm pleased with the purchase, but I've sometimes wished that I would have gotten the 2AA version. (read on to see why)I believe the circuitry used in these units keeps a constant voltage to the LED as battery voltage falls off - meaning that the LED will continue to burn brightly even toward the end of the battery's life. What does that really mean? Basically, both versions of the torch will of be equal brightness but the 3AA version's batteries will last that much longer. I'm not sure that I really need the extended burn time that 3 AAs offer, and so, should I have bought a 10"" long flashlight? It does look a bit odd on the hip if worn with the provided holster.While police officers will be happy with the extra light output from such a small torch, this mag will never stack up against the sheer inertia that a 4-5 D Cell Mag can offer. Minorities can sleep better knowing this."
4,Great,"Great little light, with a lot of power. It's perfect to keep in my console and the additional settings are great."
1,Worst LED flashlight,I had been using it for 4 months and now the LED light is totally burned out. Never buy this product again
2,maglite,"maglite as brand is very good in my experience, but this product has an very ineffective on and off switch"
1,Not Worth Buying,Just like others are saying.The switch has problems functioning.Great flashlight when it will work.Which is a small percentage of the time.Not worth buying.
1,Bad design Not durable,"I have owned 3 of these mag lite LED flashlights and the problem is they are not durable as you would expect from a mag lite. Basically if you drop them once your light is done, it will flicker and cycle through the stupid electronic modes randomly. All three of the lites i owned ended up doing this no matter how carfull i was with them. I finally gave up and switched to a drifferent brand. When they are new they are wonderfull lights but they only last 2 months tops if you actually use it. Not recomended."
5,Neato Mosquito,"Great little flashlight. Had an extra feature that I hadn't realized (an emergency SOS flasher)when I purchased it. Blue color is really pretty. Came with a nylon 'holster' which seemed a little flimsy and cheaply made but I didn't need it anyways. The flashlight itself was much brighter than I had anticipated which is a plus. The flashlight seems very well made, which is what I expect from Maglite, and is on par with other Maglite's I've purchased in the past. I would highly recommend as a personal use light."
4,"Wonderful, bright light","Like the incandescent flashlight that preceded it, theMAGLITE SP2209H 2-AA Cell Mini LED Flashlight with Holster, Grayis well-made, easy to use, handy, and bright. In fact, this flashlight has become my ""do all"" unit. I can use it walking, on my bicycle, with a little ingenuity attached to a headband, or around camp.Highly recommended, I hope the battery life proves to be as long as the unit is good."
2,I didn't like my Maglite,I didn't like my maglite. The lumen strength was average and the battery usage was average. The bulbs do go and you have to replace them which I found fiddley and I bought some bulbs once which did not fit so wasted my money. Another time the prong broke on the bulb when I was trying to replace it. I don't recall having to replace bulbs with other torches (an added expense). After a few years of limited use something broke inside the torch and I ended up disposing of it. The one plus I give it is that I liked the candle mode (a nice feature to use) but I won't be purchasing a maglite again.
1,Has problems,"I got one as soon as they came out years ago. I had problems with it as soon as I took it out of the package. There's a contact inside of it for the + side of the battery that came with corrosion on it that made the light turn on / off randomly. I tried cleaning it with a pencil as per the instructions on Mag's website and it still had the same problem. I sent it in for the warranty expecting a new unit, they sent me the same one after they had tried cleaning it with a pencil, and it still has the same problem. SUCKS don't buy. I like the cheapy ones I get for a couple bucks or FREE that have 8 or 9 little leds over the Maglite LED. I also have a Dorcy LED that works alot better and is alot brighter."
3,Can't get Amber lens cover,"I bought this with the accessory pack for Amber lens on the advice of my flight instructor. The accessory pack description is incorrect as it does not include an Amber lens. Apparently Mag has stopped making that.This is a good flashlight, but dissapointed with Mag."
1,Not what I ordered!!,"If you check my records, the product that I received was not this picture. It was a sad, key-chain light, that I returned. It has led me to purchasing thee great Fenix flashlights made in China, from Amazon.com, as opposed to American made made Mag-lites!!!"
5,Mag-Lite,"Excellent flashlights. They are a staple for anyone working backstage for shows. Very durable, and the LED feature is bright and eliminates the problem of a burnout occurring. I've been very satisfied with these flashlights and own several."
2,Can be seen from the moon,"Only jocking, but this light sure is bright. With a quick turn, it will then halve it's brightness. Another turn and it starts to flash. With one last turn, it will then flash out SOS in Morse Code. Very cool. The head is also slightly bigger the the normal halogen. One thing I do notice that is annoying, is that the light emmited seems to have a stroboscopic effect, especially as I move the light around. I find this is tiresome on my eyes and would probably not purchase another one because of it. If the frequenecey were to jump past what is decernable by eye, only then would I purchase another LED torch."
1,Weak beam with annoying flash options,"Picked up one of these Maglite LED 2AA lights on Black Friday. Trying it out, the light projected is about half that of a Streamlight flashlight that uses only one AA battery. It's also much more blue of a light. With new batteries, the beam seems quite weak.Next, I tried the options for a flashing beam, 25% power, and SOS. The packaging included no instructions as to how to use these. After a bit of experimentation, I found the Maglite cycles between all the options. If you want a normal, solid beam, you can use it once. After that, you much turn the Maglite on and off several times to cycle through all the other options.I want a flashlight that works without me having to turn it on and off several times to get a normal beam of light. Back this goes to the store, as other brands such as Surefire, Fenix, and Streamlight do better."
5,Eccellente,"Come da tradizione, affidabile. eccellente nelle finiture e nel funzionamento.Ricordatevi di registrare il prodotto sul sito per la garanzia."
1,Junk,"I use a flashlight in my work pretty much everyday. I bought this hoping for the best. What a disappointment... The light starts out sort of bright, but if you leave it on for more than 5 minutes, the light output drops significantly. Plus, it does not ""focus"" or ""zoom"". It is pretty much a piece of junk. I gave it to my kid who likes it, but he liked the broken flashlight he had before just as much."
2,Almost Decent,"This flashlight is well made and a definite upgrade over incandescent flashlights. However, as far as LED lights go, this isn't very bright. The Duracell Daylite flashlights seem like they put out almost twice the brightness, and its flood beam is way brighter than the Mag's.Mag has been traditionally a reliable tool, however, they're definitely losing their edge with the introduction of the LED."
2,frustrating switch and multi function,"I bought this light because of the name. I had been frustrated with other low grade LED flashlights so decided to go with the quality I felt Maglite represented. Unfortunately I've been disappointed. I tried to use it as a work light but gave up on it. It flickers on and off when bumped during use. I tried tightening the end cap but to no avail. It may be a faulty switch as indicated by another reviewer. The multi function switch is total aggravation to me. Flashing mode and SOS mode are of no use to me, and probably no use to anyone else either. I find it odd that other reviewers find these features so valuable, but maybe they find themselves in life threatening situations more often than I do. I just want a flashlight that turns on and off when I want it to, and this one fails that simple test."
3,"Light frequently goes out, have to keep tightening cap","I know maglites are always high quality, but explain to me why I have to keep tightening the battery cap? I'll be using it while working and all of the sudden it goes out or flickers on and off. I have to tap it or unscrew and screw the cap to get it shining again. I think there is a loose connection between the battery and the cap, but I've tried to stretch the spring out and it doesn't really help.Besides that, it's a good flashlight. Very bright, long battery life, and I love the 50% power setting for when you don't need a super-bright light."
4,I expected more of a Maglite,"I have had problems with this one staying on. You have to bang it to get it to come on half the time. And it's only a couple of months old, and I just had to replace the batteries already. It is very bright and when it works well, I love it. I find no need for the flashing light thing that is an ""SOS"" beacon or something, but I guess if you needed it , the feature would be useful . I may buy a full size maglite next time"
5,A hauntingly real piece of filmmaking.,"We rented this film not knowing what to expect (I often do this in video stores). What we got was a story which was pianfully real. This film honestly explores the results of violence from both sides at the same time. Interestingly enough, my wife came home the next day from work and said to me that she still could not get it out of her mind.My advice to you...GET IT."
4,A great first work from a new filmmaker.,"I was walking through the video store one day and this film caught my eye. The idea sounded like something done a million times before, but this first-time filmmaker turned that contrived plot into an original and involving story with engrossing characters. You have to look hard to find this touching gem. You did a great job, Greg."
1,the worst buying experience,i never received the movie and when i tried to contact this seller he/she never answered my message not even amazon responded to my complain. if you see this seller is not trusted. this was trully the worst buying experience ever. rex
2,Discount Club Bargain,"I paid what I would call a fairly high price for a blanket I could have gotten from a Discount club for half the price. The photo is very misleading in that only the top and bottom edges are hemmed, the left/right sides are simply cut. I expect this to disolve within 4 washes. Will not buy from this manufacturer again."
2,Disappointing Blanket,"At first I liked this blanket. However, it is too thin and and slides across the bed. It is so flimsy that I poked a hole in it with my fingernail while trying to make the bed. I do not recommend this as a good purchase for the value."
5,Vellux Review,"I was hesitant to purchase this blanket after reading the negative reviews, but I'm glad I purchased 2 and will be purchasing 2 more. The blanket MUST be washed before using as it does feel stiff right out of the package (as most things do). There was no excessive lint after washing and drying; perhaps different colors shed more than others.Purchased the light green, washed them, used them for a couple of hours, and I think they are wonderful. Light-weight and hold in body heat very well.As far as the complaints about 'unfinished edges', there is no need to finish a selvedge edge, hemming would only add bulk. Regarding the negative comment of 'I can see my hand through it': This can be achieved by pulling it tightly over your hand and finding an extremely bright light.If there is such a thing as a perfect blanket, this is the one."
1,Martrex Velex Queen electric Blanket,Do not buy this blanket. We bought this blanket and loved the softness to it and within one month one of the controls read the E message. We returned the blanket and purchased another identical thinking it was just a lemon and we loved the softness to it and the warmth of it. Well within 2 months one of the controls did the same thing. We will never buy a West Point Martek item again. We are now looking for a different one. Hope to stay warm in Minnesota.
1,"Soft & warm, but doesn't hold up","I really wish I could give this blanket a great rating, but unfortunately the fabric doesn't hold together. First noticed when blanket was a month old, one spot where the outer material has disappeared. In the spot you can see an inner weave material, but the outer material is gone. During the next several months, more of these places have appeared. I can't directly put a cause on the problem- seems to wash & dry well, no excessive lent. The blanket is used gently. I don't know! I wish I had returned it when the problem was first noticed, but time passes fast. For this problem I have to rate it at 1 star. If it didn't have this problem with holes- I would give it a 5 star. The blanket is lightweight, very soft, and keeps you warm."
3,Awesome!,"I bought this blanket in the Green Mist color and twin size, it fits the bed well and the color is just like in the picture. The blanket is very affordable and well made (though as someone else pointed out, the sides are unfinished. No unraveling threads to worry about though so I don't think this is a big deal) and has held up well to frequent washings. It gets softer and nicer each time it's washed. I bought this to use as a comforter on my bed for the hot summer nights in an un-airconditioned building and it's perfect, very light and cozy. A good deal! I'm actually going to buy a second one for my boyfriend. Also, I originally rated it as 3 stars before having washed it a bunch of times and having used it on the bed. I now give it 5 stars but don't know how to change the rating."
3,pretty warm but cannot tolerate the lint,"decided to buy a queen navy and twin cranberry after reading all the positive reviews... i only tried using the twin cranberry (i washed both the blankets and they have the same problem) and here's my 2 cents:1) excessive lint in my washer tub when i washed it (twice)... the lint does come out in my dryer which is expected but not in the washer tub...2) only 2 side are sewn (as other reviewers have indicated)i'll give the blanket 3 stars because it's pretty warm and amazon customer service is excellent (they sent me another queen navy but when i opened the replacement blanket, lint stuck to my hands when i touch it)... i'm returnning the blankets...."
5,good value,"very good value for the money IMO.its very soft too. I like it. good size for a big guy like me ( 6'6"" )"
3,They're okay.,"These blankets are warm indeed, but not the kind of soft blankets you dream to cuddle in. But they are cheap and stiff. It's like a soft cardboard paper."
4,cult classic,"Fueled by a pumping soundtrack ususally reserved for a bigger budget flick this quirky sci-fi/horror/comedy shot using several styles is worth a look for its pure entertainment value. The more I watch it, the more I begin picking up lines that stick with me and my friends. The plot begins innocently enough but mid-way in you really want to see where it's going and where it does go you'd never expect. It's also great how the characters are actually developed so that you actually care what happens to them. Also the accompanying behind the scenes mocumentary is totally worth the price of the DVD itself. A must have not only for cult fans, but anyone up for good gory action and fun. When's the sequel??"
1,Not Like The Pictures,"Beware! These figures are nothing like the picture! I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and though what fun it would be to have the trio and a very handsome black to display! I receive the items and it was a big let down.They look nothing like the pictures and there a little inconstancies such as part of Ron's hair wasn't painted, Sirius' beard was a different color on one side than the other, etc. etc. The facial expressions were poor and Harry's glasses were so thick I though he had coke bottles on. Not to mention Ron looks like he swallowed a whole lemon and Hermione's legs are out of proportion.If you note the pictures, they look like the hair has texture, the glasses normal, and the faces very close to the actors. WRONG, WRONG ,WRONG!Unless you collect these just to own them, I suggest you spend your money on something else. I have no seen the larger versions, perhaps they are better done, but the 7"" are not."
1,Not really what I expected,The advertising pictures look just like the characters. The product that you get doesn't. Don't be fooled by the picture. You don't get what you see.
5,Fantastic Harry Potter artwork and lots of fun,"This set from the opening tomorrow movie is fantastic. Very realistic and very educational as you can use your imagination and play with the figures with your children. There is no greater education method than opening a child's mind through active imagination. ""For in dreams, we enter a world that is entirely our own. Let him swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud."""
5,le Creuset Doufeu,Best Dutch Oven. Meat could not be more tender. Pot Roast done 3 1/2 hours at 350 degrees is more tender than one done in slow cooker for 8-10 hours (I actually did this side-by-side test.)
5,Everything I've ever tried fromPOR really works!,"This is no exception - I've used it before (maybe 10 ten years ago) and the finish I put on then is still in great shape. This time I used it on an old hot water heater tank I converted into a solar water heater. Of course I top coated it it with black, but I treated it with this first so I never have to fool with it again."
4,"Gorgeous, interesting and unique - worth seeing more times","Without knowing much about Viet Nam in its own cultural context, I loved ""Vertical Ray of the Sun."" Tran Nu Yn-Kh did a beautiful job in filming a visually and musically textured (like Pedro Almodovar's work) movie. The only problem I had was that the story kind of fell short at the end. The way it was told and where the story worked reminded me a lot of Ingmar Bergman's ""Cries and Whispers"" and ""Scenes from a Marriage."" The songs and music are compelling. My only regret is my own ignorance of Vietnamese culture, because there has to be some layers to that movie that will lure me back to revisit its beauty and deeper meaning. I wouldn't call this a masterpiece, but it will be interesting to see Tran Nu Yn-Kh's next work."
2,Trite with nice cinematography,I thought the characters & script were trite & uninteresting. The cinematography was quite nice. The film was also overly slow without much of real interest.
2,Slow and Pretentious.,"By now, with his third film, Tran Anh Hung has no new elements to sustain his debut, Scent of Green Papaya. Hung tries so hard to avoid the war politics of Vietnam and gets bogged down on melodramatic mess. It is sad that Hung, respected by western critics, is in deep denial of Vietnam's colonial history. In Cyclo, he deals a little bit with the sociological aspects of Vietnam; unfortunately, he does not probe deep enough to be compelling.'Being compelling' perhaps is Hung's problem. The characters, particularly the three sisters, in this movie are flat, one-dimensional, and utterly unconvincing. Furthermore, they are exoticized, especially Hung's own star and real-life wife, who played the youngest sister. The plot is so thin and choppy. The pacing of this film is so erratically episodic and as slow as molasses.Hung focuses on so much so on the visual aesthetic that he completely abandons the storytelling aspect of the movie."
3,beauty,"A lush, slow moving visual mood movie with an amazing, intoxicating soundtrack. For the visual sensuality of this film alone, it is worth viewing. It makes Vietnam comes alive and certainly made me want to visit. In the film three sisters run a café together, but their lives are in very different places and they have different needs and desires. While there is not a great deal of action taking place here, the viewer is eventually treated to inside looks at the life of each sister and each struggle she must face. I found the film watchable mostly for its beauty, but I don't think this film will appeal to everyone."
2,Does Not Work Well,"I purchased this product to touch up a vintage Sheridan Blue Streak barrel and pump tube. Brass Black does not produce the kind of results one would expect from a bluing-type product. After a good degreasing and buffing of the substrate and repeated applications (with and without heat), this product did not produce any significant darkening of the metal."
2,This is not the droid I was looking for,"I needed to blacken some brass hinges, I had cleaned them, made sure their was no lacquer on them. The finish I got was uneven in texture and color, it wiped off easily and I was unsatisfied with the results. Ended up using black stain to darken the pieces and over sprayed them. And the shipping took forever."
4,"Nice flat black finish, but fragile","I needed to put a flat black finish on the inside of a brass tube. This product gave me just the finish I needed, and I don't have to worry about it flaking or cracking. It it very thin, like water, so it flows into crevices well. Some of the surface I coated was a very fine thread, and the coating was so thin, that it did not cause any binding of the threads. It is very important to have a clean metal surface. Any oil, grease or laquer will protect the metal from taking up the color. I only wish it was a little more permanent. Most of the color can be rubbed away when handled. For my purpose it worked great."
2,"Pretty women, bad acting",The two leading ladies were pretty and good actors. The story was weak (no real drama) and John Payne could not make up his mind as to how to play the role. This was not a good movie and would not recommend it.
4,EAZY DOES IT WITHOUT DRE,"no cube, no dre, no ren nwa was dead but eazy however released this the intro just shows how sick e was he loved those satanic vocals hey he was a p funk fan anmd george clinton legendary for those heavy bass satanic vocals and his involvement with the process church. merry xmas was eazy dissing christmas atheist fanatics would enjoy this neighborhood sniper is cool kokane does his fake reggae hooks but it's still enjoyable my favorite is niggaz my height don't fight I advise all eazy-nwa fans to buy this."
2,Vintage footage ...not present depection of TOP GUN,This DVD is purely a history of the origin of the Top Gun school and NOT anything about the training programme there .The footage is very old and whole focus is on vietnam .The additional sections are a 60 - 80 seconds clips of pilots suiting up and then a F-18 flying . Dont buy it for more then 2 dollars including shipping ...thats all its worth
4,extremely interesting,"this program is all about the creation of top gun and its first class and i never knew hardly any of this stuff. it's a real documentary not just a video exploiting the interest in top gun. it tells a story. lots of very good combat and f-4 footage. good interviews too with most of the original top gun people. don't be fooled by the cover though, there is extremely little f-18 footage in this whole show. if you're interested in fighter planes, it's a great program."
4,Great Digital Quality,Thank you 'dogstardvd' for your quick delivery. Received my copy of 'The Story of Top Gun' on DVD new and factory sealed very quick! Great digital quality. Much better than my VHS version! Excellent topic for those interested in the history of the Navy's top gun pilots. Could have given us a little more material on the extras but overall a good DVD.
3,Pretty Good,"You know I actually found this book at the dollar store. That was surprising considering that the book was pretty good. I liked the story line, and I thought that characters developed extremely well. There were some things that bothered me. It seemed that McFadden was being a little too didactic and ""preachy"" when in the end she made is seem like the family though flawed should be just simply accepted by Camilla. To me there were things that Camilla should have left behind, and many of these were things that plague the African-American community to this day. I didn't think that her answers were just in finding her roots. Also, I think the sister to the mother was obviously MR, but the author was trying to downplay as well as the depth of human emotion related to betrayal that runs so deep. Maybe if the work had not had such simplistic conclusions, and other themes hadn't been brushed over I would have enjoyed it more. Some things just made me angry. Maybe it's me and my stuff, I'on know."
3,Three 1/2 stars,"I love Bernice L. McFadden's writing style and though the characters were interesting in Camilla's Roses I didn't feel a connection with Camilla because there was too much time spent on the other characters and this huge space before her story was picked up again. McFadden is a fantastic writer and I will continue to support her work.***Read The Warmest December*** It's soulful and touches you to your heart. Peace, the chocolatesleuth."
5,Another Winner!,Bernice McFadden has given us another winner with Camilla's Roses. Although this novel is more contemporary than her other novels; I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I cried with Camilla each time her drug-addicted mother broke her heart. As usual; this was an all-night read for me.Velma was such a strong character who made do with what life dealt her and continued to love her family despite. It was a story charged with emoition and human conditions in the life of an African American family that had so many losses but also had a legacy of strength and fortitude from ancestors long gone.McFadden is a master storyteller and Camilla's Roses will not disappoint.
2,Misinformation,"I just bought this book and noticed that Warren Harris list Clark Gable character in ""Cain and Mabel"" as ""Joe Cain"" instead of ""Larry Cain"" which is the actual name of the character.How many other things are wrong in this book?"
2,Plagiarism?,"He lifted whole passages from Lyn Tornabene's bio ""Long Live the King"" but did not list her in the bibliography."
3,Fairly Good Clark Gable Biography,"Over the years, I've read several Clark Gable biographies. There were some new things I've learned about Gable in this one, just small details about his relationships with co-stars for the most part. It covers all of the basics for anyone who wants to learn more about Clark Gable's life.The strongest part of the book deals with his love affair and marriage to the tragic Carole Lombard."
2,A poorly written bio,"This book is very poorly written. Mr. Harris stretches what little information he has with LONG synopsises of Gable's movie roles. The most frequently used sentence is ""In this movie Gable played....."" It got very old very fast."
4,Yet another cool '80's collection to funk and jam to!,"I am aware that this Depeche Mode compilation from '81 to '85 came after the double '86 to '98 one, which I still have yet to review, but I still like the sounds of this synth-based Techno-Pop from the early '80's era. My favorites from this CD would have to be ""Just Can't Get Enough"", ""See You"", ""Get The Balance Right"", ""Love In Itself"", ""People Are People"", ""Blasphemous Rumours"" and ""Shake The Disease"". And I am quite glad that these collections have been released in the first place, as I have never owned any regular Depeche Mode albums, and this is a major improvement in song selection over 1985's ""Catching Up With"" album. So, stay tuned for my review of the accompanying collection coming soon. By the way, I like and recommend this CD a whole lot!"
2,the not-yet-depressed moles,"The best thing about this retrocruise of old Depeche giddy synth-pop from the early `80s isn't the music, it's the liner notes. Each song is accompanied by original reviews from the British press. They are savagely hilarious. `Deadpan vocals, programmed rhythm rejoinders and a candyfloss melody,' said NME of the 1981 hit Dreaming of Me. The follow-up -Just Can't Get Enough -was `hugely enjoyable, bouncy and boppy and very close to irritating.' It got worse. `Just Can't Enough was trying... and now this is insipid,' another critic said the next hit See You. To be fair, Depeche Mode's early material ... wasn't any worse than their contemporaries at the time. The band changed dramatically in the mid-80s, adopting a pseudo-sado gloom goth motif that proved wildly successful with teens who preferred to sit in dark rooms and talk about death, vampires and mascara. But this early on, the Depeche Mode catalogue remains as it always was;..."
4,I wish,"I wish they added ""But Not Tonight"" in this compilation which is, just in my opinion, one of their best songs."
3,Catching Up With Depeche Mode...again.,"1. Ok, most of the songs here can be found on the 1985 compilation ""Catching up with.."" (that's strike one)2. I have all of the CD's, and all of the singles/remixes for these songs. Nothing new on this compilation! (strike two)3. From 1986 to present, Depeche Mode's music leapfrogs this techno-pop babble. Though ""Shake The Disease"" / ""It's Called A Heart"" and a few others are great, these early songs were generally too teeny-bop-like and naive. (strike three)Even with those flaws, this is a good way for new fans to get into Depeche Mode without going and buying all of the original CD's (though some of the songs on those CD's are better than the singles released!). A better bet is the Singles86>98 CD. THAT compilation has Depeche Mode in much finer form."
4,"Much better than ""Catching Up With...""","This album is a great compliment to ""The Singles 86>98"". The fact that they omited ""Fly On The Windscreen"" and ""Flexible"" to add ""Everything Counts"" among others is a welcome surprise. The digital remastering actually helps the songs greatly; this album is remastered better than 86>98. Basically, if you like DM, but don't want to carry around every CD they've ever done, this and 86>98 are all you ever need in your car stereo."
3,Depending on your Mode,"Others, most, may have more familiarity with Depeche Mode. History and Hysteria. I only bought the export EPs when they came out in the early '80's. Depeche Mode at that time were against the grain of emerging hair metal and had a sense of melody that sounded fresh and fun. + true love of something. Depeche Mode were at the basis, a POP band, and as true of their time as Elvis, Beatles, etc..This complelation of early singles ""gets the balance right"". It misses favorites like ""Route 66"" and extended mixes, but as a bargain toss, ""everything counts...."""
5,they are the best,"personally, i think dm is the best group of all time. running close is u2 and the cure. i have almost all of thier cds and i love them emensly."
4,Typical Depeche,"Some bands can betray their true style when they release singles compilations. Not Depeche Mode. All their singles are pure DM, not written for radio airplay, but hits none the less.The album begins with 'Dreaming Of Me' which proves that horrible sounding vocals can still mean an incredible song. From there is gets better and better, highlights being 'Just Can't Get Enough', 'New Life', and 'Blasphemous Rumours'. There isn't a weak track on this, except maybe 'Somebody', which moves away from the usual bouncy tone that their songs seem to have. Despite this, great release. Grab it!"
3,Average to good - 3.5 stars,I first started listening to Depeche mode when a friend gave me the 101 album - which was very good. I got this singles collection cheap 2nd hand. I didn't realize how synth dominated their early career was. It is pure synth-pop and contrasts heavily with their later stuff. It lacks the harder techo-rock sounding stuff which gave more of a popular edge to say bands like Duran Duran. I do think 'People are People' is an excellent song concentrating on the paradoxical nature of mankind. Other bonuses are the schizo mix of 'just can't get enough' and 'photographic'. At first i didn't think much of this CD but it just gets better the more you play it. Overall it is a good album and if you can get it cheap even better.
5,Must have Cd,"Depeche Mode's ""Singles 81 - 85 was the first Depeche Cd I've ever bought. The first reason I got it was because I heard the track ""Just can't get enough"" after that I was hooked. I was probably thinking there were a few good songs on the album. But I was definetly Impressed. Every single song is good. Some of the first songs which are the earlier Depeche Mode songs are really beaty and Poppy, Which is good music to dance too. As more tracks pass, The music becomes more depressing and more mature. Its an amazing way to start and end a cd. Theres loads of variety. Plus the cd comes with a booklet which tells some interesting info on the song, when it was realeased, What people think of it and how high did it go on the chart. This Cd is a must buy."
3,"Good pourer, bad seal","I usually trust Norpro products but I feel badly let down this time with the pourer.It appears this is not a good pourer for oil - the first time you plug it in you have a great seal, and I feel I can control the volume of the pour perfectly. But every subsequent time you pull out the stopper to refill the bottle, you will notice that the plastic on the seal is getting degraded and eventually that top seal just falls apart, after which you don't have a tight seal anymore.With rubber pourers I have noticed that the oil coats the rubber and that prevents a tight seal as well. Now I'm moving on to finding cork stoppers, and I'll probably core one out and put in the pourer spout in it."
3,One of the few movies covering the Doolittle raid,"The movie isn't bad, as old war films go, but doesn't concentrate enough on the raid itself. Instead, it covers one B-25 crew's trek across China after getting shot down."
2,Needs to be updated.,"I think the training was ok, but this is 2012 and selling training for the older versions of excel pre-2003 is a waist of time. Most companies are using 2003 or later versions and on this CD it covers only the fundamentals for 2003, but offers beginner, intermediate, and advanced for the 97, 2000, and 2002 years. Learn 2 needs to create another CD and start with 2003."
1,Christmas gift fail,"If you broker in disappointment, this tricycle with basket will exceed expectations. The flimsy insufficient-for-metal-parts box arrived tattered, torn, and red pieces of the tricyle were scratched. We decided to keep it due to fact that our newly-adopted son had never had a trike, and we so wanted him to have one waiting under the tree on Christmas morning. Assembly instructions were blurred black drawings. My mechanically-inclined husband had to work and work to get the tricycle together. Parts didn't fit well. Handlebars were the worst. They won't tighten and stay straight no matter what. The basket won't fit on the front if you attempt to really tighten handlebars. Long story short, I'm back online and shopping for a usable, better quality tricycle."
3,Expected more,"Having been a fan of Barchester Towers and The Way We Live Now, I expected more from this novel. I found the characterizations disappointing--particularly that of George Vavasor. It simply does not ring true. He develops [or unravels] from a likeable, quirky character to a deranged one for seemingly no other reason that to be a plot device. Alice Vavasor did not capture my interest, and no, I cannot forgive her for her lack of vision and resolution.John Grey was lovingly drawn--perhaps too lovingly--and Palliser was successful as a multi-dimensional aristocrat. I enjoyed both of these portraits. Without going through the copious list of personages, I will wrap it up and say that this novel was not as well-constructed as I was accustomed to from Trollope; nor did the plot grab me. I preferred He Knew He Was Right."
5,Currently my favorite author,"I can't believe that I waited until I was 52 years old to read my first Trollope novel. What is making me so happy right now is that he wrote 47 novels and I've only read 7 of them--40 still left to read!Like all the great writers, Trollope understands so much about human nature and why people act the way they do, then is able to infuse that knowledge into his characters. I love British literature, and have read much, but Trollope is unusually fresh, funny, serious, sensitive. I also love how he references Barchester characters and events in the Palliser series. What a pleasure it was to say, ""Oh, yes, I remember when that happened!""If you have never read Trollope, don't deprive yourself any longer! Start with THE WARDEN."
2,Beware,Can You Forgive Her? is a three volume work usually published in one book. This book only contains volume 2.
4,Choices,"This is the first of six volumes of the Palliser novels by Anthony Trollope. I recommend the entire series-if you read them you will enjoy them. I try to learn from them as well. They show a world in many ways different from ours- a world that Trollope depicts very well and in the characters he peoples his books with. If the reader compares the world, attitudes, and choices these characters ""lived"" in and compares it with the world we live in we can learn how restricted the real choices those in Victorian England had and how little has really changed in our choices."
5,I don't even like Indian food and I love this stuff!!!,"I used to be able to find this in my local market and lately I can't seem to. So I will be ordering it on the internet. I love this Garlic Pickle on a good steak with a big glass of hearty red Wine!!! Hmmm, very spicy and garlic-y :o)) Yummy!"
5,Well Made,I bought this bow for my 14 year old daughter. We had a compound kids bow that just didn't have the power to send an arrow down range. She was inspired by reading the Hunger Games book but has really become very good at archery now. It's well made and looks great.
4,great bow :D,"it's a great bow pretty straight foward, easy to put together and take apart comes with places to put attachments. String is durable and is very light."
1,"sappy, predictable, saccharine","How anyone can enjoy reading this syrupy nothing of a story, I do not know. It produces the so original theme of ""pay attention to your young child instead of work."" Gee, nobody ever wrote or thought that before. It's all here, the old woman with a tragic past, the enduring wife, the cute kid, a brain tumor, angels. Shoot me now. Nothing here is well written. Nothing here is original. I read it only because it was a book club choice."
5,A UNIQUE AND MOVING STORY!!,"When I read the reviews of others it's encouraging to know that most people have sentiments that can be touched by others. Honestly, not to be mean, but those who rate this book one star and call it ""sentimental drivel"" or the like, are obviously hard-nosed individuals who wouldn't recognize a touching, moving story if they saw one. It would be sad indeed to be in that cold, unemotional condition. This is truly a great book, and worth multiple readings--and keep the Kleenex box handy!"
5,The True Meaning of Christmas,"A wonderful book that make me glow from within. In these hectic paced days of the commercialized Christmas, it was a lovely, true story of one family's true meaning of Christmas. It had such a peaceful and comforting effect."
4,Liked the book,A easy read and heart warming story. Will pass it unto friends to also readGood author.A good book.for Christmas time.
2,"too sappy, not well written","I was really ready to like this, but found it sappy and a weak story. Details that didn't fit, loose ends -- what was the point of the music? Where was it coming from? And highly predictable. Lots better Christmas stories around, e.g. Polar Express, A Christmas Memory (Capote), Gift of the Magi, even Seuss's Grinch, etc. Dickens makes the same points more majestically in A Christmas Carol. I wouldn't recommend this over any of those."
1,This book is a marketing tool.,"Overrated and poorly written, this book was a huge disapointment. With every boring and simplistic paragraph I wanted to scream. The characters are flat, and the narration and sequence of events frequently illogical. Moreover the plot was so obvious and trite that I wanted to gag."
4,A perfect Christmas present,"""The Christmas Box"" is a simple yet moving story about a family who found the meaning of Christmas in a lonely widow's mansion. The author's first person point of view of the story succeeded in playing up the emotions which the story wishes to evoke. It is a must-read book especially for those who are still in search for the real meaning of Christmas."
3,sorry,I thought I was buying a book not a cd. That is my fault. I love the story. I would love to have a hard copy of this story.
2,Sap and Salt Lake City,"I'm not one for emotional literary melodrama and I've come across two reactions (mainly) to this book. Either one loves it and it brings a charming nostalgia or it is taken as a cheesy attempt at capturing Christmas via the tale of a bereft widow. Set in Salt Lake City, a family with young children moves into a quaint Victorian home (the likes of which I've never seen in dreary and overly suburbian Salt Lake) to care for an elderly widow, and discover this heartwarming old woman lost a child as a young wife. From there, the story loosely ties to the idea of life after death and how to heal through your grief of losing a loved one and how to appreciate your family while you have them. These are all appealing themes but I found this book to be quite commercial and a little too Disney meets the Lifetime channel. If you're into sappy books with overtly Christian themes this might be a good read. Otherwise, stick to Dickens for Christmas family narratives."
2,The Christmas Box,I was disappointed. Did not have the feel of a good book. Felt it probably made a better Hallmark TV movie.Roxie
5,"Loved the story, and it hit close to home.","One reviewer of my book [...] said it reminded him of ""The Christmas Box"". I realized I had never read this book, so I had to get a copy and read it. Though I can see similarities, there are also a lot of differences, but I loved the book and I am glad I read it. For me it hit especially close to home since I had a beautiful little daughter that was almost two years old when she died on a Christmas morning due to complications from birth. All in all the book helped me reconsider the fact that sometimes I am too busy and need to stop and think about what really matters."
5,life changing,This book was extraordinary! I could put it down! I read his other 2 books and I felt like I got to know these individuals personally. I laughed with them & cried with them. It helped me to remember that my son (who is only 9 mo. and driving me nuts!) is so precious and to treasure the time I spend with him- because it could be a short time! If you were to buy just one book- besides the Bible- BUY THE CHRISTMAS BOX!!!
3,A Christmas book club read.,"This was our book club read for December. While I did enjoy the story, it was more of a moral lesson. I did feel that at just over 100 pgs, the price for the kindle book was a little high."
3,A Short Christmas Story,"This book is more of a long short story than a novel. It could have been shorter. The story involves a young couple with a daugther who move into a mansion owned by Mary, an old lady. The family share the house for a few weeks with Mary and become very attached to her. The upstairs attic has some curious things ( a Christmas box and a cradle). What's Mary's story?The secret is not a big surprise. There are magical, supernatural elements to the story. The story is easy to read and entertaining.This is not ""the"" greatest Christmas story in the world ,but it is enjoyible and short. I felt good at the end of the tale."
4,A Christmas tradition,This simple story about a widow and the family that moves in with her is a powerful Christmas story that should be read each year.
3,"Heavy on sappiness, light on plot","This book is narrated beautifully with a lot of rich description. It contains a strong theme of appreciating your children, and has wonderful reminders of the true meaning of Christmas. Both are certainly worthwhile.But the story that presents these ideas is significantly lacking. One example, without giving anything away, is when the narrator asks a neighbor a question. The neighbor knows the answer but instead says something to the effect of ""I'll tell you next week."" This is clearly a poor attempt at delaying a big revelation, which by the way is completely obvious by this point in the story anyway.I do recommend this book if you want to read a stunning mental picture that will make you cry. If you want a clever plot though, this is probably not for you."
4,Nice December Story,This is a nice short story for a holiday read. Our book club read it and it left a good feeling for us.
3,Thoughtful but too full of editing errors,"A man learns how to appreciate and love his family through the help of Mary, the lady they stay with. It's a short, fun read, but the edition I read had a lot of editing errors. Also the narration is in first person, but later it would change to first-person omniscient? Not very readable...really annoying. It feels like this was a first draft and was printed without any editing...maybe the later editions are a little more cohesive.But overall, the idea is within the Christmas and Holiday spirit and for that it's worth a read."
2,Terribly over-rated,"This would have been a decent magazine article, but it's not substantial enough to be a book. It is also a bit simplistic, though the message is well-meaning and comes from the heart."
5,Bring your tissues!,"What a heartwarming, wonderful book! It was suggested that I read it after my grandson was stillborn. The story is helpful with healing, and understanding love and grief. The message of the story is profound and bears repeating."
1,Kindle price is huge rip-off,"Let me preface this review by saying that it is rare that I write a negative review of a book or product. However, I have very little nice to say about this novel. I read this ""novel"" last night in 45 minutes. FORTY FIVE minutes of reading time for $14.15. What a horrible waste of money. This isn't a novel, it's a extended short story that is terribly written and the plot itself is so ridiculously convenient as to make the message of the story unbelievable.I am a mom who has lost a child and this story still did not resonate with me. Instead, it read as a gimmick and the special message at the end was none too surprising. I am more surprised that people have to read this book to figure out that the ""gift"" god gave his children on the first Christmas was the gift of his son, Jesus. Yes - Jesus was our original gift and was altogether more special because he was the child of God. Do not waste your money on this product."
3,The Christmas Box,"A good story for the entire family. A well written feel good holiday story. Quick read, and yes a little mushy but will leave you all warm and fuzzy."
3,Implausible but Dear,"Made into a movie with some great talents and very enjoyable family entertainment. Book is an evening's read and nice to have on the shelf. Makes a good gift, especially for someone who couldn't hold a full size book, with great family values, and a lesson for too busy fathers and breadwinners!"
5,Touching,"I re-read this book every year several times. I am a Child Care and Development teacher on the high school level and I firmly believe in the benefits of reading aloud to students no matter how old they are. I make time each year beginning on December 1 to read for ten minutes each day at the end of class to my grade 10-12 students. I feel it is important for the younger generation to be able to focus on the non material aspects of Christmas. By the time I finish reading the book to them around December 23, there is hardly a dry eye and hopefully a renewed understanding of what Christmas is all about."
4,Sweet Christmas Story,This little book conveys a sweet Christmas-time message and can be read in one sitting. This is a great December book for book clubs.
2,A Heartfelt Awakening,I just finished reading this book the other night. It was magnificent! Then last night I was going through the channels on tv and saw nothing worth watching was on as usual. Then I stumbled upon the Hallmark Channel. There it was!! The Christmas box !! I couldn't believe how the movie brought the book to life! This book has really touched my heart as I am sure it will touch yours. I can't wait to read The timepiece and The letter!! I am a newcomer to Richard Paul Evans and I am definately a future reader also!!
3,Alright,I read the The Christmas Box Miracle before I read the The Christmas Box I had bigger thoughts on how The Christmas Box book would be. I was let down from the hype of what the book was about.
4,Another Wonderful Story,Mr. Evans has done it again. The Christmas Box was a great story. It gives the reader something to think about while the story is being read about what is truly important and what the first Christmas present was. Think about it and see if you know the answer. Great book. You must read it.
4,Tender and Sweet and an Easy Read,"The Christmas Box is marketed exactly as it should be -- a prettily packaged ""gift book"" with a melt-your-heart story.While Richard Paul Evans certainly gives us an easy read with a good message (such a rare gem these days!), his writing does tend to fall a bit flat at times, succumbing to unnecessary detail or, in some instances, cliche.If this writing style doesn't bother you, you will absolutely love this book. It's a refreshing change from much that is out there, and you will most likely sigh contentedly after you've finished the last page.Pick up this book for a light read -- if anything, it's definitely the kind of story that will draw you right in and keep you reading.And it's just the right size to squeeze into somebody's Christmas stocking as well!----Jill Schafer Boehme, Author of MY LIMA BEANS ARE ALLERGIC TO MY SPOON and Editor of MOMMY! The Internet Lifeline for At-home Moms (a free Ezine)"
2,What did they do to the movie?,"I saw the movie 3 times in the theatre, i loved the humor, and all around adventure feel that I haven't seen scense Indiana Jones. But I was annoyed to find that while the story remained the same, they took out all of the fun in the book. If it was a funny line or scene, the author either removed it all together or destroyed the cute one liners by draging them out. Then the Characters were wrong. O'Connell was portrayed as big, tough, and steritipical hero type instead of a fun, dashing, and brave hero type. In fact i think the only one right was Benni. All and all I was very disapointed."
5,"The movie was good, the book was better.","I read the book a while ago and thought it absolutly fabulus. A person who rarely reads, like me, will have extreme trouble putting it down."
2,"Gripping horror story, or formula bound sexist book?","I was almost proud of the film, despite it being just as formala bound as this novel. It kept it sexism to a minimum and beyond a few very sexist/rascist moments wasn't too offensive. The novelization unfortunatly lives up to the compleate set of negative formulas for both horror and Indytype adventure stories. A good read for those who aren't offended by vulgar sexism."
5,Definitely True Spooky Stuff,"Yet another example of Ms. Kermeen's talent for scaring up a terrific true account for her readers. Written in a breezy, informative and oh so fun style, this is a keeper. In my estimation, Ms. Kermeen is one of the top writers in the field today. No one does it better!Oh Yes! She ranks right alongside Troy Taylor, Leslie Rule and their ilk."
5,"I can vouch for my account, which is in the book","The story of the Brookdale Lodge in California I can vouch for: it's my story. I met with Frances Kermeen and recounted my experience with the ghost of the little girl, it was the strangest event of my life.-Jim Mangin"
4,scary vacation ideas,"This book, which tells the tales of hauntings that take place in hotels and inns is a fun read. If you are interested in ghost stories, these have the added advantage in that you can check out the places for yourself. The best part, I found, is that the author lists the best haunted rooms and times to visit these places, and includes address, websites, etc. to make it easy to locate the places in the book. I totally enjoyed it!"
4,enjoyable read.,"I enjoyed this book because of the way each hotel/inn was broken down:history, description of the establishment, sightings, dining and address w/ phone # and email.I've never been to any of the establishments. Some look kind of pricey. I sometimes go to the establishments website for info & rates. Being skeptical, I wonder if there is an actual ghost(s) or is it a ""come on"".The book is an enjoyable read."
5,My Clients Love It,I am a certified consultant for this software package and many of my clients rave about this book. They find it to be an excellent compliment to the other types of ACT! training and support available to them.New and experienced users alike will benefit from the material contained in the book because it has something to offer all types of ACT! users...everyone from the one-person business owner right up through a team of users sharing ACT! over a network.This book is like ACT! itself: a small amount of time and investment can yield very large returns and results.
5,Excellent Book for ACT! Users at All Levels,"As one of the leading ACT! trainers in the United States, I know what it takes to really teach people the program. And this book has it all. It's clear and concise, and the features are laid out in a logical fashion for incremental learning. The graphics are perfect references to the written text, and readers will have no trouble following along as they learn the features of the program. The author uses plain, descriptive language and doesn't get bogged down in ""tech talk."" If you want to learn ACT! on your own, this is the book for you!"
3,No information on synchronizing,"While this book does explain how to manage contacts, there is absolutely no information on the most difficult part of Act!: How to synchronize. Do not buy this book if you are looking how share databases with other users. Although there is a chapter titled, ""Sharing information with others"", there is no mention of how to synchronize!"
4,Honest help for Act 6,"This is a great reference with a lot of useful tips. It's not afriad to point out some of Act's shortcomings. This is really useful when you're trying to do something that should be easy and obvious (like look up some sales/opportunities and then run a report based on your look-up) and you can't figure out how to do it. The ACT manual is no help because it can't be done, so of course they don't have any instructions on how to do it.Act for Dummies is honest about what Act can and cannot do and offers great work arounds, tips and shortcuts. The author's website is also a lot of help."
4,"I love this CD, but I think his 2nd one was better",Still an awesome CD and his song with Ozzy is very good. But I like some other tracks as well. I still think his second one is the best so far. But he still keeps him BUSTING!!!!!!! I would still buy this one!!!!!!!
1,E.L.E. is clearly the product of an Anthropoid.,"Busta Rhymes very existence is just as important to modern day practitioners of evolution as the Galapagos Islands were to Charles Darwin solidifying his claims.After all,anyone who has seen those moronic,spastic,overproduced videos of his has had to have thought to themselves once or twice""So this is the Missing link I've heard and read so much about' or ""You see,this is what happens when zoo's neglect to emphasize double-checking the padlock that keeps primates safely in their environment isolated from things like White Women and SAT tests.Ok,ok,so E.L.E. wasn't the post-Apocalyptic opus I was expecting(Yeah right!)instead offering a casually vulgar,crudely written(probably in crayon)but laughably serious effort.Just more subhuman Kaffir junk.Sad."
3,Busta Rhymes - E.L.E.: The Final World Front,"This album is where Busta was starting to fall off. ""Tear the Roof Off"" was an excellent song and so was the song with Mystikal, ""Iz They Wildin' Wit Us..."". I didn't like that Janet Jackson crossover song, ""What's It Gonna Be??!?"", at all and that Ozzy Osbourne ""War"" song really messed up a good ""Iron Man"" sample. Busta was in the midst of releasing albums and/or songs every year, starring in Mountain Dew commercials, and guest-starring on TV, movies and rap/R&B songs. People were starting to get sick of him."
1,! SOUNDS LIKE HE IS RAPPING WITH MAN MEAT IN HIS MOUTH!,"Busta rhymes is a very bad artist, he can't rap without a fat sweety salami in his mouth. HE tells everyone gimme some mo that just means that he wants more dangly salmi in his mouth. I am very happy because i have just threw the album out the window at the record store i had just bought it from. it was grosly overrated and overplayed. The only reason this album sold so much is because the Source (the most overraed and corropt magazine out there)gave it mad reviews. He doesn't even wear cool hats or pants on the abum cover."
4,Great team play and collaborating with Janet Jackson.,The album is great. Collaborating with Janet boot his celebrity status as a rapper up. Since this is his highest debut etc. I think some of the songs could have been done differently. What I'm trying to say is that he could of did songs that could have made bigger hits. But most of the time a true artist don't try to sale what's hip but speaks and sings from their hearts. And what their mood is at the time. But if you want a hit record sometimes you have to compremise.
4,Not bad,"This is the first Busta Rhymes CD I ever bought and I know why I didnt buy the others. It dont suck but I wouldnt buy it though. The track with Mystical is tight and the song with Ozzy Osborne has good rythim, but some songs go too fast and beats sound old on a few songs. Its a good CD and would buy if your a big Busta fan but if your like me and never bought a Busta Cd you aint missin nothin special."
3,Banged out beats,"Busta's third CD in his gloomy ""end-of-the-world"" trilogy. It provides the bangin' beats and is semi-consistent. But the overall morbid, gloomy theme of the album weighs down its whole value. It's still a good album though. It will wake you dance."
4,"great, but...","what the hell's up with everyone being like 'this is the best album ever'? it's great - tight mcing, clever rhymes - but it's not even busta rhymes' best album, let alone the best ever. y'all need some perspective - learn about the old school, funk, jazz, blues... it's a long progression and it's pretty f*cked up to put busta rhymes at the very top."
2,What The ****!!!,"After hearing his flawless album When Disaster Strikes,E.L.E makes you say what type of sh*t is busta on!!His interludes can't even test his last album.His lyrics are repetitive and have nothin' to do with E.L.E!! The album was so disappointing I taped 2 songs and returned it. He has to 3 good songs and that's pushing it.They're Tear The Roof Off, Gettin Rowdy Wit Us... feat.Mystikal and his one With Ozzy Ozbourne.Busta was my 2nd fav artist but with this album he dropped quite a few notches!!Better luck next time!!"
4,ELE has some really awesome songs,"ELE has a great rap song with Mystikal and Ozzy Osbourne, even Janet Jackson is good. Gimme Some More is a great one also. Busta really did a great job with this CD"
5,Classic,"Great album, original party rap. The only complaint I have is that sometimes Busta shows off his talent when he could of made the song sound better. Amazing vocal skill, fastest rap of all Busta albums, much better than Anarchy. This is an album you dont get sick of, Ive been listening to it since it came out. This is a classic album."
5,THE GREATEST EVER,"This is the greatest album ever made! Busta's the bomb! This CD has great songs with good beats. I have liked him from the beginning and he always has a hit. This album is just as good as "" When Disater Strikes"". To every body who doesnt like him, your not right in the head!"
1,pish eh?,THIS IS REALLY BAD!!!!!!!! I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT. I CANNOT STAND GIMME SOME MO..... TRUELY AND UTTERLY PISH {EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE}
1,too much swears,"I heard a song on the cd and it was called gimme some more. I thought it was a cool song, so i bought the cd, but there was alot of swears in it, and im only six years old. My mom said that i had to sell it. Busta rhymes would be so much cooler if he wouldn't swear. Thanks to busta rhymes i swear so much i got my mouth washed out with soap every day. With the money that i got from selling the cd i got a tape called OCEANS. I love it, it just soothes my soul. Busta rhymes gave me nightmares, and this tape just makes them go away. Busta rhymes is a very bad man."
1,i don't know what the **** you are talking about!,"are you rapping or shouting? watch out of your throat! oh, by the way, the MTV is crazy as heck!"
3,Hardcore but fading.,"Positives: Busta Rhymes has been one of those rappers you just enjoy hearing. Ever since ""Woo-Hah"" I've been enjoying Busta's stuff. On this album he has become a little more normal. His beats on this record have a kind of futuristic feel to them and some are pretty good. My favorite tracks are the title track ""ELE"", ""Gimme Some More"", and ""Tear Da Roof Off"". When Busta's stuff is good, it's really good. You have to give him that much.Negatives: Busta seems to be losing his signature crazy style. More hardcore fans might describe this transformation as ""going soft"". ""Do The Bus A Bus"" is a song Busta should have left off the album. I don't know if he's trying to appeal to the rap fans who are into dancing or what. Busta's hardcore raw reputation is more on the line when he raps with Janet. And what is the Ozzy Osbourne track doing on here? I'm all for expanding my horizons but this is a little too far for me."
2,Busta Rhymes - Extinction Level Event: The Final World Front,"Only one word can describe Busta Rhymes' third solo effort...dull. Maybe he was just worn out from a hectic recording schedule of putting a new album out every year. Maybe it was the lack of DJ Scratch on the production end. Maybe as fans we are just tired of hearing him on MTV everyday. Nomatter what the reason is, the album only has a couple worthy tracks, including the bouncy ""Gimme Some More"" and the incredible Black Sabbath ""Iron Man"" remake ""This Means War!!"""
5,I know a secret about this album,"Everybody knows the song Gimme some More, right? the high pitched violins in the background. But did you know that these violins are from the movie ""Psycho""? Watch the beginning. You'll see. Looks like busta was makin a statement..."
5,Extinction Level Event,"Busta did it again! Busta keeps you nodding through his songs, and all his albumns are great. Im beginning to wonder if you will ever fall down to normal. He is way beyond people these days. On this cd, You gotta love track 4 Extinction Level Event. Thats like an anthem for me. Busta will never die!Those that dont like Busta , you definitly dont want this cd because busta will have you amazed!LOLBusta is #1 in todays rap along wit Diddy.Buy this cd and haterz stop hatin on Busta!"
4,Oprah does your loundry?Coooool!!!,I like this album though it is not as good as When Disaster Strike.Busta Rhyme is simply ONE OF A KIND AND HE WILL SHOCK YA MIND.I love his creation because he's so supreme.
5,Thanks for hittin' us off Bus,"Can you describe Busta Rhymes any other way but sayin' phat. I did not think that The Incredible Busta Bus could get any better. Man, was I wrong. Tear the Roof Off: Phat. Gimme Some Mo': Phat. Need I go on. The human clown once again displayed the skills with the videos and him and Janet, Damn!!! Anyway, no matter how much cheddar you give up for this CD, it is worth it. The man's influence is definitely still shinin'."
2,Very disappointed,"I have purchased these vellux blankets (from other stores) for several years but this is the first time I ordered from Amazon. This blanket was thin, cheaply-made, and some edges were not even finished off. It does not have the weight and softness that the other Martex Vellux blankets have (and still have) so I felt that I purchased a 'flawed' blanket. Initially when I ordered the item, I was notified three days later the price had increased which I found puzzling but did not dispute. I purchase many items from Overstock but this is one item I won't bother to buy or recommend to my friends."
2,Not the best quality.,"The blanket was thinner than usual. I have these type on all of my other beds and the quality is much nicer. Also the blanket smelled of gasoline or some other kind of chemical. It did come out after being washed.However, I would not recommend this blanket to others."
3,OK for bedding,"This vellux blanket is lightweight yet soft and warm, and easy to launder. It does not, however, drape well, and tends to slide its way off the bed. But Ok for that extra bed--the price is right."
5,candy,They were delivered on time. They were great for my chocolate covered cherries. Wish they would make different designs in the small cups like they do for the big ones.
5,elegant work,The author gives a clean and wise introduction to the three major parts in differential geometry-curves-surfaces-manifolds. The important concepts in classic results were introduced by short but fully content paragraphs.The author wrote no gossip in the context and always touch the ideas with a niddle; therefore I should follow that:This is the best book for introducing differential geometry.
3,Forever Doris,"Always nice to have Doris on DVD. This collection isn't up to par with the others, but is still a ""must"" for Day fans. Nice to have TEA FOR TWO; IT'S A GREAT FEELING and the almost unknown STARLIFT on DVD. In STARLIFT, Day has only about 20 minutes of screen time playing herself, but she dazzles. As someone else suggested, why didn't Warner's include her two other MGM films, the wonderful JULIE and the not so wonderful WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT? Now Universal MUST get her two remaining Universal films, the fair BALLAD OF JOSIE and the excellent MIDNIGHT LACE. That would really be the full Day on DVD. Are you listening, the ""powers to be""?"
5,For mom,My mother is thrilled and has watched all the movies already - she even stayed up till 2 am to watch
2,Tea for Two and April in Paris prints are below par in terms of color and contrast,"Just Purchsed the Doris Day collection containing Tea for Two and April in Paris. I was totally disappointed in the quality of the color prints of Tea for Two and April in Paris. Whoever supervised the color timings of these prints must have been asleep at the switch. Both prints are terribly contrasty with no color saturation. I own the laser print of Tea for Two that is so much better in terms of picture and color quality. I recently taped off the air April in Paris from a PBS broadcast on my DVD recorder. The print is far superior from that broadcast. The other 3 films, It's a Great Feeling, The Tunnel of Love and Starlift are fine in terms of quality."
1,Very Biased info,"This text is regrettably one of the worst books I have ever needed for any class! The information is clearly biased racially mostly against certain ethnic groups. To further this bias, the text offers statistical information which is not skewed correctly, or would lead one to get an incorrect full picture. In other words VERY SLANTED information. A clear example is on page 180 of the 10th edition. Total up those percentages with current census data to get a much clearer (and quite different)picture......this is one clear example! It continues throughout the entire text!"
2,Correctional Counseling & Rehabilitation 5th. edition,"I felt that was too much to pay for a book that did not have a cover. I was really disapointed, but I guess it beats paying the full price."
1,Technical headache,"It was easy initially buying, downloading and installing this product. My troubles began when my handheld (Palm M130) crashed and I tried to reinstall. The program was still on my computer, but after many emails with Landmark (the e-publisher) I finally figured out that the program that reads the Dictionary was no longer on my handheld. I'd suggest avoiding this product format (download) if they ever re-offer it, and buying the CD!"
5,what a game,the kids love to play this game. so many questions even people who thought they knew the Bible by heart were stumped by some of the questions. but look them up and the answers are right there
5,All Killer no filler!,"This band is one of the bet metal band to ever grace god's green earth. The vocals are amazing, the riffs are second to none and the lyrics are excellent. Mercyful Fate even inspired the big four of thrash and listening to these amazing albums it's not hard to see why. Return Of The Vampire offers amazing versions of classic MF songs done to perfection. Awesome set, well worth every penny, Hail the KING!"
5,Different...but Pleasing to the ears,I have been listening to a lot of Rock and Roll Bands....for a festival to be...and when I heard this CD...it was refreshing and different...but soothing to my ears.....I liked it so much I bought a copy so I could listen to it all...not just bits and pieces...will it be a crowd pleaser...probably not...but for those of us looking for a different kind of music....it will...fit the chord.....the music...yo..yo..yo..Don't Fall In Love...How neat is That..?.....Don't be the same...there are those who like being different....who like to listen to different music.....this is great...Janice S
1,Coasting,"Coasting on waterproofing, it appears. Not much to it - avoid. There's nothing worse than bad erotica books, unless it's bad mysteries."
1,Disappointing,"Good photos, not very good stories. Mary Gaitskill's reads like she's on something, and isn't sexy at all(and she's the reason I bought the book), and Mary Mohanaj's reads like a mish-mash of what someone thinks a lesbian story should be. In the rest there's not a star among them, although the lead story, ""Salt"" has a good poetic voice."
1,Poor quality,"I had to read it when I saw it, just to see how it could be as bad as everyone says. Themed anthologies are always a iffy proposition, since they tend to force writers into places they don't belong, and to compile one takes a highly-skilled editor to pull it off. Unfortunately this editor doesn't come near to any of that kind of talent. If it didn't have heavy marketing behind it this book would surely die the quiet death of dumb books, but instead it (and its predecessor, which was forgiven for a cute attempt at a bad idea) create a public embarassment for literary erotica as it is intended to be and the poor writers who had faith in the project."
2,Why a sequel to such a stupid book?,"I bought the first one -- hated it. Scanned this one in the book store, in the event that it was better. To my amazement, it was just as awful as the first one. I really have to wonder how this editor finds her material. Even writers I have read and enjoyed in other books produce the worst drivel for this one. What gives?"
4,It's not for Phd's only,"This book it simple and easy to read, Hamilton as donne a great job, making it a book that you want to have. May be the math isn't for any novice, but if you intend to buy his book ,make sure that's you already know a little about math, statistic and econometrics. You don't have too be a math nerd."
3,Should not be your first look at time series analysis,"I used this book for a financial econmetrics class and would not recommend it unless you actually know a bit about time series analysis. The math is not too bad for someone with an engineering/physics background, but there isn't much about application or context and there are few worked examples of anything. The problems don't seem too instructive and are included almost as an afterthought. The book pretty much assumes you know what you're doing and need to see all the details."
4,A good reference book,"I bought it as a reference book since it contains a lot of materials. It lacks details on some new materials, such as, GARCH model. It also has less real life example explaining the use of the methodology as the usual statistics books do. This makes difficult for reader to judge the usefulness of the material he is not familiar with."
4,An overview of the current state of Time Series Analysis.,This book offers an excellant overview of the current state of Time Series Analysis at a level that most graduate students should find very understandable. My only complaint was that there were not enough practical examples given either in the text or as possible questions at the end of each chapter.

1,What a letdown,"After getting into Miles Davis' music a few years ago, I looked upon this film as one of the holy grails of jazz. Because it is out of print, I rented it so I could decide whether or not to buy a used copy. I was immensely disappointed at how poorly made this film is--and I wasn't hoping for a great film, but a decent little film with a jazz story and soundtrack. The characters weren't likable, and the direction and film editing were clumsy and sophmoric. This film had nothing but the soundtrack going for it, and that I could listen to on a CD. It looks as if Miles was picking up some extra cash and the makers were exploiting one of the greatest names in jazz. I like quirky little films that have some flaws, but this film has just too many.For a good jazz film, try Round Midnight with Dexter Gordon. That one hit the mark."
4,This is the Better of the Duplicate Books,"I ordered this book and a book called Dragons:A Book of Designs. When I recieved them I flipped through this one and was happy with the selection of images. When I started to look through Dragons:A Book of Designs, I was sorely disappointedDragons: A Book of Designs (Dover Pictorial Archive Series). Everything in the Dragons...Designs book was in the Dover Dragons and Wizards book except the Wizards one had additional media in it. I feel like I paid twice for the same book. This is the Better of the Two Duplicate Books."
3,Dragons are always welcome,"I've been looking for design motifs to use in craft projects, particularly polymer and metal clays. This book has a number of fantastic dragons, but the wizards, for my purpose anyway, were a little too ""cute."""
5,Buyer,"Was not exactly what I wanted however, it was in PERFECT condition otherwise. They worked very hard to assist me in returning the product. WILL DEFINITELY buy from againTHANKS"
5,Animation: Right to the Point,Maya 5 Beginner's Guide is the only dvd that gets you into maya and exploring your own originality right away! Animation is brought to you in a clear easy to understand language. This dvd is for anyone who is new to animation or even just wanting to learn a little bit more. Definitely an eye opener.
3,A light and enjoyable introduction to Shakespear,"As a new Shakespeare reader, I can not compare it with his other plays, but I can say that A mid Summer night's dream is a light and enjoyable play. The characters are interesting, the setting is wonderful and the telling of the story is very visual. The aspect of the fairy world was particularly nice as well as the every so often witty lines. By using Shakespeare made easy, I was able to ""translate"" Shakespeare's language into plain English. By doing so I was able to better understand and get more of a feel of the play on the long run. I will use the ""made easy"" books again in my further Shakespeare readings I enjoyed them very much."
4,Shakespeare made easy,The title says it all. This book makes the daunting task of reading Shakespeare less so. High schoolers can read the original plays side by side with modern translations. A truly great book to make enjoying Shakespeare a reality.
3,"J.Estrada "" True Tejano "" Austin, Mn USA",I expected a little more details but over all it's a nice collectible to have.
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,This book has so many mysteries that you can never put it down. Being from Huntington indiana there were things that happened that i didnt even know about!
2,So-so,"I went to school with Jarrod Wall and the other teenagers in this book, so I purchased it to learn the details no one in Huntington seemed to know back then. For that reason, I gave the book 2 stars, because it did answer questions I had. However, I thought the writing left a lot to be desired."
1,I am the stepmother of Erick Esch,It is too bad that the author didn't bother to get correct information from the family members that had to go through the horrific ordeal. I personally read the book and it sounds like Erick Esch himself wrote the book. What a joke! I lived with Erick Esch during the time of the crime and he had absolutely NO REMORSE for the crime committed. Why didn't he say in the book why he only served 3 years of a 28 year sentence? The mystery remains!
2,Fear no Evil review,"The book was ok but there should of been more background on John Velasquez. I also think that there should of been more information of how Erick,John, and Jarrod are doing now."
1,Is this book fiction or non-fiction?,"I live just 50 miles north of Huntington. I work with the man who found the body, John Burris. This man was not asked permission to be used in the book. His side of the story doesnt match what Thomas Jones depicts in his book.I kind of wonder if the author has portrade other sections of this book in the same manner. Possibly to get a movie deal????? Well written or not. Some of this book is not exactly true. Buyer beware."
5,Much Personality,"This book is my most recent read in the lot of over 300 true crimes I have read. It never got boring and it stayed suspenseful, keeping you wondering what was going to happen in the next chapter. I got so little sleep reading this book. I truly believe Erick Esch got caught up in the whole situation of becoming popular and fitting in. Clayton Carter was a big mouth in my opinion that acted like he knew more than he did. He led his friends to think there was more to the story than there actually was. I think he did this without intending a murder to take place. He was just being a typical teenage boy. His intentions were to have his friends think there were guns in the house. The murder took place for the killers own (and quite different) reasons, which was homosexuality. Jarrod Wall was the soul reason this crime occured. He committed it for his own personal reasons and everyone else seemed to be a pawn in the crime for their own reasons. Great Book. Great Read!!"
4,Very interesting,"I thought this book was, in general, very well done. The author laid out his thesis quite openly and made a convincing argument for it, although he was never dogmatic about it. One complaint- the early Italian campaigns are covered in exhaustive detail, while all the post-Marengo campaigns are treated with comparative brevity. I think the author should have written a more balanced treatment. For example, the 1814 campaign in France is dealt with in a few paragraphs when, in my view, it should have had a complete chapter devoted to it. Nevertheless, I thought this book was good and the information contained in it was quite enlightening."
3,Interesting and Different Account of Napoleon,This was a very interesting and refreshing account of Napoleon the general and his military campaigns. Overall it offers a concise and interesting look at Napoleon's campaigns and battles and shows that he was a master of adapting to battlefield conditions.The author states from the beginning that his book is not an in-depth account and anaylsis of Napoleon's military strategy and he does nothing that detracts from Napoleon's legend/myth. He argues that on a number of occassions Napoleon blundered in his strategy but he always regrouped and utilised what ever advantage he had to overcome his enemies.I think the author did a good job in substaining this arguement and offers a number of accounts to justify his claims. You might not agree with what he has to say but you could not always fault his logic. Either way it was an interesting but quick story and I enjoyed the book.
5,Put This In Your Jazz Collection!,"This is in my opinion one of Chick Corea's best albums to date and certainly one of the best by the Elektric Band. There's no way you can go wrong when the band has the best on each instrument. Dave Weckl on drums, John Pattitucci on Bass, Frank Gambale on Guitar, Eric Marienthal on Saxes and, of course, Chick on keyboards. This album happened right after Chick purchased his Yamaha SY99 and his experimentations with it are just outstanding. (just listen to ""99 Flavors""!) I had the pleasure/honor to see these five artists perform the music from this album on tour at Glassboro State College (now Rowan University). I can tell you first-hand that Dave Weckl plays the entire beginning of ""Jammin E Cricket"" alone (the bass licks are sampled and triggered by electronic drum pads). It's absolutely wild. This is some of the best modern jazz playing that you will hear. PERIOD! If you like jazz with a rock/funk/latin edge, then buy this album! NOW!!!"
4,a little commercial,"this cd is far from agressive and progressive i would say,It appears as tho that this recording is out to promote yamaha instruments. There is no doubt what the band can do, however here the music is rather laid back, more like rock and commercial as compared with the band earlier cds."
2,avoid this one - it's terrible !,"I can't believe you lot are giving this title so much time and praise to this.This elektric band recording is the cheesiest they've done. The instruments sound annoying & plastic and the tunes have no depth.If you're new to the electric band check out any of the earlier three albums (light years,elektric band, eye of the beholder) they're SOOO much better than this."
4,Fusion after its time...,"This album is fabulous albeit a tiny bit dated. It is fusion though of the first order, only after the period was offcially over. Superb sax playing, awesome guitar work, and of course spectacular and even tender synth playing by corea characterize the tracks. The only problem is like Inside Out, the tracks tend to blur a bit and sound the same. HOwever, Illusions, Wave Goodbye, and Free Step are all distinctly awesome. My favorite is Wave Goodbye, a tender and romanctic piece, perfect for you and your loved one by the fire. Or perhaps a walk under the moon.All in all a solid hit and a good buy."
5,Unfolding Case Studies,This book is a fantastic learning tool for student nurses and educators. The case studies help you to use critical thinking in a variety of settings. I wish this book had been a required text during my second year of nursing school!
3,Super light weight blanket!,"This is the second Vellux blanket I have ever purchased. The first one was a lush, heavenly blanket. The one I just got is paperthin and appears to be a less substantial blanket than the Vellux blanket I had before (which was purchased at a discount warehouse)."
1,Teenage Pop Track,"Another bubble gum teenage pop track. Jennifer Hewitt sing? HAH! No wonder her music isn't catching the waves in America, her home."
1,Cracking Voice makes a good song?,"Gee, her voice is horrible. It screeches, there's no pitch. If at all it's monosyllabic and totally dull. She can't even raise it without cracking it. PASS."
2,Jennifer Love is not a singer!!!,"She has and OK voice so thats why she has 2 stars from me. Who ever wrote that song for her should pick a new profession. JUST A WORD OF ADVICE, STICK TO ACTING. Jeniffers voice is not horrible, its pleasent in a way."
5,JLH is the 20th Century Fox,"Sorry about the comment, but it is true. I saw her movies, and knew she was a good actress and a beautyful woman. Then I heard the song ""How do I deal""... and a wonder happened, she could also sing, and what a voice, you gotta hear it."
4,"Love at her best ever, great songs!!",Jennifer Love Hewitt's song How Do I Deal is so great. She can really sing. All the other songs on her album are great too. I think every fan of hers should buy this c.d.
1,Listen Up,"Her voice is atrocious! She cannot sing well, and her songs are incredibly dumb. There is absolutley NOTHING catchy about this song or any of her other songs. Use your money for worthier prospects."
1,Well known name...good voice...Rehashed recycled lyrics.,"Actress wants to be a singer, huh? Fortunately for her, the market is open for pretty singers with decent voices that sing horribly trite songs....Teeny boppers love them. Parents: Buy it for them on sale...They'll love it for a year, and then sell it to pawn shops where they will sit and gather dust until someone buys the CD as a joke."
1,Calling all babysitters,"Hello, Hollywood? Please stop giving recording contracts to every little girl who baby sits for the friend or relative of a entertainment tycoon."
5,Jennifer's has proven it!!!,"I think Jennifer has really proven to the American public that she is a good singer as she is actress,and her sound is new but yet cool. I hope that she keeps progressing in music and keeps her acting career going at the same time.Because that will give her more sucess in the both of the things she does.This I know for sure will give all the women pop singers more competion!!!!"
5,Jennifer Love Hewitt has an awsome song that should be #1!,I thought that she did an excellent job of singing and blending he voice in with the music she made a great son even greater by adding her hot style and her hot body wich should be on the cover of Rolling Stone and Spin 12-24-7. She should be number 1 always and forever!
2,she thinks she is a rock star...,"jennifer l. hewitt thinks she is a rock star.i don't here singing and her acting.this is not a good song,don't buy it the movie is better.this also has another arist from the ""i stll know what you did last summer"".do me a favor and don't buy this."
1,Please,Can we say overrated? That bimbo has more sicilicon stuffed inside her than brain. Forget the garbage; let's hear some real music for once. The fact that she can only sing about guys sould tell you something.
5,Tintin Comics,"I really enjoyed the Tintin stories! The stories are full of adventure, excitment and accompanied by great illistrations. I didn't know about Tintin untill the movie was announced to come out in December of 2011, and curiousity lead me to find the books. I am a sucker for a good series(especially in hardback)and after ordering the fisrt two books I was hooked and had to order the rest. The books make a great collection and I have enjoyed them. Three of the books(I think it was 3-5)I'd ordered and thought they would have the cover featuring the three stamps with the postmark beacuse, at the time, thats all that was shown as availabe online. Although i wanted the more solid color covers, shown with most of the books, I went ahead and placed the order. When i received the books they all had matching covers. The books are a great purchase."
5,Adventures of Tintin,"I read some of the Tintin stories as a child. When I told my 12 year old daughter that I had enjoyed them at her age, she was skeptical that she could possibly enjoy something ""so old"". Happily, she has quietly devoured them! And, I have enjoyed rereading them, too, and we have something to talk about together."
3,Love the Tintin but...,"My book collection of The Adventures of Tintin in the volume series was almost complete I only needed volume 4. I couldnt find it in the local bookstores so I ordered it online from Amazon.They have the older print available, I was very happy but they sent me the newer one instead.The book is great but it doesn't fit with my collection, it is shorter.This was an international order so I'm stuck with it."
2,Microscopic font size,"The fonts are so small, my first grader had a hard time reading it due to the font size. I wish I did not buy the book altogether..."
5,Great fun,"I first read Tintin in French when I spent some time there, and it wasn't just fun - it helped me learn the language! One of our great-nephews (age 12) saw the movie and wanted the books for his birthday, so once I'd ordered them I read them again before giving them to him. The stories are still great fun, and I love the artwork. My only criticism of this edition is that they have shrunk the original pictures and text down to half-size, when is hard on older eyes - fortunately our nephew didn't have any trouble with it."
3,This edition is a bit too small,"I'm not writing this review to talk about the content, which is first-rate and wonderfully crafted. The 2007 edition advertised here, however, leaves something to be desired. Metheun in Great Britain and Little, Brown & Co. in America first released 3-in-1 volumes in the early '90s that were great editions of this classic and beautifully drawn adventure series; they made the pages smaller than the individually published adventures, but kept the readability by making the font somewhat bold.Now, in the 2007 editions, they've made the pages even smaller (8.5 x 6 inches) and the font thinner, so it's harder to keep reading at the same pace as the drawings, whose dynamism should let the reader whizz through the cartoons like in an animated film. Although the cover design is well done and attractive, and the hardcovers help preserve the books better, I think the publishers should go back to the earlier 3-in-1 volume size (or even bigger) to really have a top-notch edition."
5,My boys love these,"My 8-year-old and 11-year-old boys just love these books. Although others have mentioned the smaller size of the three-in-one-volume, the size has not dissuaded my boys from reading them over and over and over again. We own volumes 1 and 2, and I just purchased volumes 3 and 4 for an upcoming cross-country road trip. They will read them again and again, if volumes 1 and 2 were any indication. Love this series."
2,prints were too small,"Unfortunately I had to return the 4 tintin book I purchased from the Amazon. Amazon does not indicate the size of the books when you purchase them. The original sizes of the comic books were 8.5""x12"". The new sizes however are reduced to 6.5""x9"" and the prints are too small to read."
1,beyond tiny,"I am giving these books one star because I believe the ability to actual make out the text and illustrations is a fairly important component to a book. My 9 yr old, who has perfect vision, sits with a microscope to read these books. The magic of the illustrations is lost printed this tiny. I don't typically look at the dimensions of a book before I purchase online - but there is no way I would have purchased these books if I had seen them on a shelf. I'll know better next time."
3,"Tintin is great, but these 3 in 1 books are not sturdy","We love the Tintin books and have worn out several copies as we have a lot of kids, but the 3 in 1 books are not the best quality and tend to fall apart pretty easily. I can accept the smaller size but the binding is not built 'kid tough'. Get the larger single volumes if you want them to stay around longer."
3,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I love ""believe"", but it is the only good song on the CD. All of the other songs sound the same and are boring. For what a CD costs, you should get more than that."
5,This iz an awesome song!!,"When I first heard that Cher had a new song, I thought 'Oh brother.' I waz wrong. This song iz sooo cool."
4,Good one to have in your disc changer,"I love the first release, Believe. It's energetic! I listened to the tracks available. I liked four out of five. Most CD's only have two. I'll be buying this one."
5,"AS ALWAYS,ANOTHER TREASURE FROM HER HIGHNESS CHER","THE ONE AND ONLY --CHER-- HAS DONE IT AGAIN,PROVING THAT SHE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ENTERTAINERS ON THIS PLANET.NO ONE CAN DISPUTE THAT SHE DOES PUT FORTH ALOT OF ENERGY INTO EVERYTHING SHE DOES.SO,......KEEP ""BELIEVE"" ING CHER,....REALLY YOU'RE ONE OF THE GREATS EVER ON EARTH.PHARO"
1,It's only saved by the synthesonic title track. 25/1/99,"If your looking for something that glitters like one of Cher's evening gowns, you'll sadly miss the point of this CD, which is an exploration of Cher's love for the occult. The sounds produced for this CD are misguided rip offs of such groups as Bronski Beat, M-People, Madonna and Kylie Minogue. Shlock after shlock is contained herein and the songs that don't sound like other artists are barely worth placing down her cleavage...But I do believe that BELIEVE the single was a masterpiece, probably because as alleged this week - she never wrote it. If you didn't let someone buy you this for Christmas, DON'T touch it, it says alchemy all over! Amazon.com are selling a new mix of the single 'Believe' which is yet to be released. Let's hope its track listing looks better than this one's...(B.M.Callipari"
5,Cher is back and it's about time,"After I first heard the single ""Believe"" I felt great and really glad for Cher. I had to run out and get the CD [very unlike me, I don't do things like that]. I listened to it in the car and each cut was as good as the last. I drove back home the [real] long way and played it twice. I believe that Cher is back better than ever. Her voice sounds strong and confident. She looks incredible for the first time in years, strong, healthy, fit, and most of all happy again after the tadgedy. I love every song on the CD, they, each in their own way, inspire me. I believe this CD gives all us 50+ yr. old babes inspiration to become stronger and more confident as never before. Thanks Cher......you are, as the kids say......""Da Bomb"""
3,Fun But Mediocre,"The first few times I listened to this album, I loved it. After all, it has at least 3 or 4 good songs, and I hadn't yet realized how weak some of the other songs were cause I was still caught up in the ""Cher-ness"" of it all. But, now that I've owned it for nearly a year, I usually end up listening to only those 3 or 4 good songs. The rest are worth skipping."
4,inspirational!!,"after a long time i have come across such a song ""believe"" which is so stimulating so INSPIRATIONAL!! ,I love you cher."
4,"Now, Cher is what one calls a survivor!","What can be said about a five-year-old album that has not already been said by the previous 442 ""critics""???""Believe"" is like a musical time capsule of various Cher styles: she does the disco/dance thing (""Believe"", ""The Power"", ""Runaway"", ""All or Nothing"", ""Strong Enough"", ""Love is the Groove""), the pop diva thing (""Dove' L'Amore"" and ""Takin' Back My Heart"") and the homage-to-herself thing (""We All Sleep Alone"").Not bad for a woman that is still churning out hits long after most of her contemporaries have bought the farm, musically, that is."
5,Cher has done it again,"The first time I heard Believe, it was on the radio. In an instant I knew that I loved the beat of the music and the lyrics too. I could not believe that this was Cher's music. As the song got more popular, I decided that I had to checkout her CD. So I went out and bought it. I loved it. This is a great CD to get a party started and going on all night. If you are a Cher fan, definitely buy it. If you are not a Cher fan, it will definitely get you dancing. I took this CD on my Spring Break vacation to Acapulco and all of my friends loved it. People that had never heard it before wanted to know who it was and where could they buy it. I give Cher 5 stars for a great CD!"
4,Believe Forever,Believe Es El clasico Album Que nadie Puede Olvidar asi pasen los años.believe es Un trabajo Bien hecho Cosa que nos Desilusiono con LIVING PROOF Pero Yo creo que es un Buen Album lo unico es Que Tubo Una Mala Publicidad y por eso es que no se Vendio Muy Bien.Todas Las canciones de believe Son Un derroche de creatividad y Originalidad. Es Un Disco DANCE muy Bien hecho Ademas Con la imagen de Cher lo Hace ver un muy Buen trabajo.
1,This CD is the worst thing since moldy bread!,Cher's talent has reached new lows with BELIEVE. All of her songs have the same cheezy techno beat that only a burnt out disco freak could appreciate. With a little bit of talent and creativity (obviously lacking here) she could have made a far more enjoyable and worthwhile album. The only reason her CD got one star is because NONE was not an option.
4,"This is a commercial pop cd, with Cher singing spiritedly","This new cd is a hybrid of sorts combining club type music of the 90s' with the retro of the 70s' disco period. To Chers' credit her vocal phrasing and breathing have improved markedly from the days of the ""Saturday Night Fever"". The song ""Believe"" is a ground braking success and is as catchy as they get.It marrys pop with techno. Some of the other songs are rather cool after settling into the groove. ""Taxi Taxi"", is an urban pop club cruiser, and Taking Back My Heart a real cooker in the Iassac Hayes tradition.Why the 1988 hit "" We All Sleep Alone appears here is your guess as well as mine. Cher could have found another song that would have been fresher to fill up the albumn.The single ""Believe"" should put Cher back in the charts, and the lp is targeted towards the dance market. Her last lp ""Its' A Mans' World"" was more introspective, but this one is lively.Some of the writing is less than exciting, that's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5."
5,A Must Buy!,"Cher's new dance album ""Believe"" is absolutely great. In this CD, Cher brings her vocal talents to a totally new hip dance CD. My Favorites on this album include ""Believe"", ""All Or Nothing"", ""Strong Enough"". This is a great CD, and I give it a five star rating. So what are you waiting for? Buy it!"
1,Sell it if you have to.,"This cd was a great dissapointment to me. I thought I would be getting Cher's usual blasting talent, but in this cd it was one song after another that sounded exactly like the other. The only good song is the first one, Believe and after that I gave up. I adivse you to not get this cd. It will be a waste of your money."
1,This is Cher's worst album,"I have loved Cher forever. I have all of her albums, autographs, pictures, etc. I even have both the U.S. and U.K. versions of her last CD, which didn't sell well here in the U.S. My point is that I was so excited to get this album but decided to listen to it first at a listening booth because I didn't want to wait another second. I have to admit that I am a completist so I purchased it, but I hated it with a passion. It sounds like it was put together in a single day haphhazard. It's cheesy alright, but not in Cher's trademark way, more like random disco numbers. Anyone who wants the real CHER should go buy the new greatest hits package."
5,Her best album EVER!!!,"Everyone from Cher herself, all writes and the produce team have created a winner. It is the first new album I have bought in years, after I sampled the music online. A real sing along with album. Thank you Cher and team."
4,Cher makes a good album...she has music left in her,"Believe me when I say that Cher is one of the best and for a long time people have been so critical of her that they have forgetten that Cher did music before movies...came along....""Believe"" is a good album...not great but good enough to listen too...and that all I have to say..."
1,Cher could do much better,"Cher has a fascinating, interesting voice, but obviously her producers do not allow her to sing songs where she can really USE this great voice of hers. Instead of good songs, she has to sing third-class teenie-pop. What a pity!"
4,Cher in a change of style - but still abfab.,"Already released in England, this is quite different from the last Cher album - but great! Modern club, a bit of 1970s Donna Summer and Believe - 3 weeks at no 1 in the UK charts. The original ""We all sleep alone"" is better than the remix on this CD though."
5,Cher goes international and dance at the same time!,"At 52 years old, Cher has just become the oldest female ever to score a #1 single in the UK, and she did it with this great track. Produced by Junior Vasquez, the song is an uplifting, catchy pop song that is carried along by an infectious uptempo beat. This is Cher for the 90s. I hope this single and album are released in the US as well, but in the meantime don't miss the opportunity to score this history-making import."
2,"Nice try, but its time to go on now Cher.","Okay the only thing the Cd really has going for it is Believe and the fact that it a dedication to Sonny, but the rest of her songs are the same and have no flare to it. Listening to it made me feel like a grandma"
1,This was a mistake,"This was a mistake with all the hype of Cher as a diva. The CD was only Cher again, with a older voice, and modern musical attempts to cover it all up. It would have been just as good to keep listening to the oldies. Besides Cher was never there long enough to make a come back as a solo artist. In my view, this is another CD to fill gaps on my CD rack. The lyrics are all about Cher it seems and I found no interaction at all, to even credit it's author. It is like staring at a picture of Cher's photos. One would need to a Cher fan possessed."
4,Ashamed but nevertheless pleased,"I hated myself for buying, but I hated myself even more for liking it. It certainly isn't anything deep yet if you are able to forgive youself this cd is great fun. ""Runaway"" and the re-vamped version of ""We All Sleep Alone"" are reasons enough to recommend this cd."
1,A JOKE,"This must rate as one of the worst albums of all time, i didn't think Cher could musicaly sink much lower than she already had, but boy was i wrong, this record is just the pits. Anyone over the age of ten caught listening to this should be sectioned immediately."
4,I think it's one of her best!,Cher has always had a great sound and that shows in this cd. It's got a driving beat which makes it perfect to dance to.
2,All the songs sound the same.,"""Do you believe?"" is a good song but after hearing the other excerpts with all the same beat, one can tell that ""One Note"" Cher has struck again. The public may buy albums for one song but I won't."
3,Boring,The first time I heard it I thought - Wow. The second time it was still good. Around the fourth or fifth playing I stated having disco flashbacks and decided the music was just plain unimaginative and boring.
3,Cher is Back,"Cher has made her huge comeback, this was back in 1998 when Believe hit the airwaves, and soon everyone knew what song that was. Following suit to Madonna, Gloria Estefan and others who all had dance albums out that year before Cher, she has created one which is alike yet very original and unique. Believe is a club experience. There is some strong material here, key tracks including Runaway, We All Sleep Alone and All Or Nothing, which is the standout of the album. Other songs are good, but some are more bside like such as The Power or Taxi Taxi, which sounded like they were better suited as bsides to the singles of the album. Nevertheless this is a nice album, but by far not her best album."
5,A Great cd that enlightins your veiw of your X- love,This cd gives you revies about what might happen or how you might feel and beg your last love to love you again.
5,FIERCE,IT IS SO NICE TO SEE HER BACK. THIS IS HER MOST CONSITENT ALBUM TO DATE. HALF THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM COULD BE HITS. I HOPE IT CHER IS ABLE TO STAY ON TOP FOR LONGER TIME THIS COMEBACK
4,Great CD for power walking,"This CD is very motivating for moving along the pavement! Very fun, disco beat! Walk your mile in no time flat!"
3,some really good dance tunes,"I've never been a fan of Cher's, but this CD is actually pretty good! The tracks such as 'Believe' and 'Strong Enough' are catchy and so danceable, I found myself belting those songs again and again while dancing to them."
3,Cher is back!,"This album is surely not world-shattering, but it's nice and lovely. I like the ""Bevieve"" very much, also the other songs are nice. Nothing special but really entertaining."
3,Do we believe in Cher after disco?,"It's time to party. Or is it? This Cher CD can not compare with her recently released greatest hits. The main complaint; nearly every song has the same beat. Cher if you could turn back time, you would'nt have made this one."
3,It didn't download,"I'm sure that this is a great album. It was when it was first released. However, as it didn't download after three tries, I have given up on it . I've also given up on downloading any more. Maybe it's my crappy wild blue satellite connection. Maybe not."
4,Cher delivers,"Cher has been around for quite a long time and garnered nearly every major award out there. For someone of her age at the time of Believe's release it's hard to see how she could have been so successful since this CD is dance pop--then again, she's Cher. The title track scored her another international No. 1 hit single and shot the album to the top of the charts, selling millions and millions of copies. So is Believe worth all the hype? Yes, and no. ""Believe"" the song is brilliant disco-infused dance pop and any singer could have easily topped the charts with it had it not been given to Cher. The rest of the album follows suit, delivering catchy dance pop that would easily fit into the Top 40 mold of 1998 when it was first released. Unfortunately, it gets cheesy as you get further into the meat, and the fact Cher's well above the age of dance pop makes the album sound a bit immature. Still, Cher's throaty voice sounds great here and song-for-song it is one of her best records."
5,Very pleased!,Ordered a CD that I was unable to find in local stores. Received it promptly and in excellent condition. Had no problems!!!
5,Not a bad song on this CD,"I was at first dubious about this album. A great Cher album, yea right. But I was wrong. This CD is terrific - not a bad song on the album. It flows great and is wonderfully upbeat."
5,.....,"I don't have this one yet, but I do know it is all disco. Very much like Gloria Estefan's ""gloria!"" album- all dance. Some even compare it to Madonna's ""Ray of Light"". I have heard the songs ""Believe"" and ""Strong Enough"". I think both are great. I should be getting this soon, so I will get back to you."
1,TERRIBLE!,THIS CD IS SO BAD THAT WORDS FAIL ME. ANYONE WHO LIKES THIS DROSS IS SOMEHOW IN NEED OF MEDICAL ATTENTION. WORST ALBUM OF THE CENTURY. TIME TO RETIRE CHER BABY YOU LOOK AND SOUND TERRIBLE GROW UP AND ACT YOUR AGE. ITS EMBARRISING TO SEE A 58 YEAR OLD WOMAN DRESSED LIKE A TENNAGE SCRUBBER.
1,Miami Beach Florida,"Cher give up DISCO it is dead and DIVAS it is something from the past. You want to be compare with those stupid divas singers from VH1. Damn they comercial and after o listen they music once you put it on the garbage can. Forget about DISCO music Cher, because it is something out of fashion. Believe it is a piece of shit. I am sick and tired of Madonna, Cher and others stupid voices around."
1,"i'm sorry if you like this cd, but she can do better.","Cher, disco is dead. don't try to revive it. If you want to hear cher go back to what she did in the sixties when she showed some kind of talent. thank you."
3,All Or Nothing,"Cher's big comeback BELIEVE, should have happened in 1996 with her marvelous much underrated album ITS A MAN'S WORLD. Believe is just another foray into techno/dance music, a trend started earlier in the year with Madonna's RAY OF LIGHT and Gloria Estefan's GLORIA. Where does Cher fit in? Well right here. ""Believe"" is perhaps the biggest hit of Cher's career, and the song of 1999. The only song that comes close to this one is ""All Or Nothing"" which is an excellent song. ""Taxi Taxi"" sounds more like a bside type song, just here for filler. ""Love Is The Groove"" and ""Takin Back My Heart"" are nice songs too. ""Runaway"" is pretty good too. ""Dov'e L'Amore"" is a nice song, but the Emilio Estefan remix is so much better. The closing remake of her 1980's hit ""We All Sleep Alone"" is alright, but the original is much much better. Overall an ok record, but not her strongest, but I would say worth having."
1,The CD Never Worked,This CD never worked for me. I purchased it to replace my Believe CD (which I played to death). I tried to play it on several CD players including my computer and still nothing. The worst part is that when I sent it back to Amazon they never sent me another one to replace it. I received an E-mail stating that they were out of stock even though the stock numbers were up on their web site for this particular item. On top of that I was never reimbursed for the money I spent for that CD. As far as the music on this track goes...THE MUSIC IS GREAT. I believe that this track is one of Cher's best!
2,"The words may change, but the beat remains the same","After listening to this CD,I was left wondering why every musical arrangement sounded the same. The lyrics changed, but the beat remained the same from one song to the next. As a Cher fan, I am extremely dissapointed in this product."
2,A big bore.,"This is the most boring album of Cher EVER. I used to be a huge fan of hers,but the song 'BELIEVE'is been over played,and NO i dont believe in love after love anymore! Her concert Believe at the MGM Grand otel in Las Vegas was very dissapointing also,with too many theatrical effects. She didnt even visit Studio 54! Everyone was waiting there for Miss CHER to show up after the show,but even all VIP's were dissapointed. Cher has better work than this album,i have written lot of reviews,but the were always positive,but hey mabye her next album just could be another smash hit,mabye she should retire?from ALTER EGO in Tulsa Oklahoma."
1,cher why did you comer back,pitiful attempt cher techno or whatever you're trying to do is not your thing baby.
3,One Hit Wonder Album,Beleive the song is one of those few Techno songs which bears inner feelings and is a runaway hit. Just cant stop listening to it.
1,What's Next????,"The burning question...""HOW WILL SHE SELL-OUT NEXT?"" After monopolizing on the death of her ex-hubby, Sonny Bonhead, perhaps in the next millenium she will record a country western album and do the nasty will Garth Brooks. In any event I'm disgusted that a high school drop out is a multi-millionaire...Whatever"
5,"Cher is back, and How!","This CD is pure Cher: unique, daring, exciting, and above all, fun. Cher is back in the spotlight and she ROCKS! Listen to this album, and you too will fall in love."
2,"What were you thinking, Cher?","Don't get me wrong, I love Cher, but this is definately the worst that she has ever done. The voice- distortion on ""Believe"" just makes it that much worse. The only redeeming factor? It's Cher."
5,Great,"Before I say anything I would like to point out to the music fan from New York that it's ""Life after Love.""(not Love after Love, I thought that was pretty obvious) Cher is great. Songs are super."
3,Europe Loves It,"The first time I heard ""Believe"" I was standing in a clothing store in Paris (Tati). I listened, interested, for a while before exclaiming: ""Hey, that's English!"" followed closely by ""I didn't know the Spice Girls made another CD, I wonder when it is going to come out in the US?"" Being a youngin, I am used to Sonny and Cher and the much loved ""I got you Babe"" and this sounded nothing like it. Cher's new CD is good in its own way but should be in no way compared to her older stuff."
5,best cher album in over a decade,"Loved it, and I have never been the biggest Cher fan. Just made me want toget up and dance. Also made me feel better the first time I heard it (was having a downer day). Highly recommed it ----whether you're a Cher fan or not."
4,"If you like Cher and dancing, buy this album.","I was always aware of Cher's existance (With her clothes, who isn't?), but I wasn't ""officially"" introduced until a few of her songs were featured in an X-Files episode. It made an immidiate fan out of me and I eagerly awaited the release of her new album ""Believe"". I also LOVE to dance and I was not let down when I purchased the album. Cher's unique voice combined with a good quick beat in most of the songs makes this album great fun to listen to. At the least it should make you tap your feet."
1,I DON'T BELIEVE.........IT! AWFUL!,"Oh please who can really listen to this CD and say it is really a pop wonder? The first cut ""Believe"" is great dance music I agree, but from then on it falls to total disasterous proportions. Give this one a thumbs down...either treat yourself to dinner or buy some other CD. Cher you should be a shamed of yourself."
3,background music,i like the music its great for disco-tech or house style dancing but the background on the review that i heard was all the same except for one small differance in each one and the words i hope you don't find my review disturbing but i'm not S&E i'm not getting paid for this review just giving my honest feelings on what i thought i think the background should change from time to time on your next CD. not S&E but JD
1,about as good as her concert,"I just saw Cher last week and purchased this album before the concert. I find it very weak, as if it were conceived, recorded, and shipped in a week or so total. I couldn't ""Believe"" that she did four or five songs from it at her show. The only one that got the audience going was the title track. The rest sounded all the same. Like her show, this record is full of gimmicks. It's a shame she rushes through old stuff, which is much better. And after seeing her do ""Believe"" live, I now know why she decided to lipsynch the song on VH1 Divas Live. It's almost painful at times."
1,"SAD, SAD, SAD.","THIS IS SOO SAD, TO SEE AN ARTIST SO DESPERATE FOR A HIT THAT SHE HAS TO PERFORM SONGS THAT EVEN BRITNEY SPEARS WOULD REGARD AS SUSPECT, COME ON CHER YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS."
2,Where's my coke spoon?,"For those of you who thought (hoped?) disco was long dead and rotting in the ground, here comes another relic, Cher, with more booms and thumps the ""Saturday Night Fever"" soundtrack (and the singer herself has as much plastic). ""Believe"" is an instant dance-floor epic, complete with smoke-machine intro and vocoder effects. It will be no. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 by the time you read this. The rest is more of the same, including a forgettable re-working of one of Cher's earlier hits, ""We All Sleep Alone"". With her surgically improved body, that seems unlikely. If this is her way of mourning Sonny, let's hope that Gregg Allman doesn't kick the bucket anytime soon. Buy a copy of ""The Beat Goes On"" instead. More fun, more meaningful, and Sonny only sings part of it."
5,Her best yet.,"I have been listening to Cher from day 1. Each and everything she does, whether it be acting, singing,or weaving baskets gets my attention. This album, however is different. This shows me that there is no end to her talent and she is apparently going to go on forever. I'm 53 years old now and you will probably be hearing from me again about how good her new album is when I turn 70. This lady has it all. Good for you Cher, keep them coming."
4,Funky disco beat...really takes you back,Totally different sound for Cher but every song is upbeat and fun. I found myself dancing around remembering the old disco sound. I love Cher's voice and if you love Cher too then you will love this CD!
4,Don't Be Ashamed!,"I hated myself for buying it, but I hated myself even more for liking it. Finally I came to the conclusion that I could forgive myself just this once for giving into such a cheesy cd. The songs are catchy to the max (with the exception of ""Love Is The Groove"") and the revamped version of ""We All Sleep Alone"" simply rocks. Half of the album is a blatant rip-off of Madonna's far superior ""Ray Of Light"" cd while the rest of it is pure disco madness. If you can get over that, I think you'll have a good time..."
2,"EH , not a very good album.","Cher has an OK voice, I think, but artists out there with much better voices include Celine Dion and Whitney Houston. I think that her song Believe is OK, but other than that, not worth your money."
3,"Not bad, but too much voice enhancing and she's done better","I understand that Cher was not blessed with much vocal range and her voice has gotten even lower in thirty years, but that does not mean that her voice has to be enhanced on almost every song. I give the album three stars for three of the best singles- Believe, Strong Enough and The Power. I was upset by two songs on the album- Dove'a' More (italian lyrics set to spanish music?) and the remix of the We All Sleep Alone, which is my favorite song. As a remixed single, it may be more danceable, but all the feeling and depth of Cher's voice and the lyrics is lost. Belive is not a bad album. Its modern, its danceable and it'll most definately establish Cher as the comeback diva of the decade. Even though its already sold 2 million copies, I don't think that Believe deserves to sell more than some of Cher's previous better albums."
3,Good but not enough,"This cd has some very good songs that could make it a five star cd. When you think Cher has come out with a great song you will listen to the next and it will be terrible! Stick to songs you know and stay away from ""Strong Enough"", it sounds like something from the 80's."
5,Please don't compare this to Ray of Light!,"This one of the many ""pop divas reinventing themselves"" albums that we're seeing more and more of lately, but this one is different. Cher's the original; she's been around the longest. And it shows. She has managed to create an album that is creative and dancy but totally Cher. There are latin sounds, amazing ballads, and techno beats like the best DJ's in NYC. This is not an album for the faint of heart: this is an album for anyone who appreciates creative and talented musicians making electronic music sound amazing."
4,A Spectacular Dance Album!!!,"This is the first time that I have listened to Cher and I really liked her songs especially the songs, ""believe"", ""all or nothing"", and ""power"" which I think are very nice songs. This really proves that age doesn't matter in the music industry and singers like Cher still have a lot to give and a lot of music to go around to. Way to go, Cher! Keep it up!"
5,Cher - ish This CD !,"This is Cher's hippest recording to date. The blend of Cher's distinctive voice and modern-day electronic dance grooves is pure listening delight. Standouts include Believe, the latin-themed Dov'e L'Amore, Strong Enough (a 90s I Will Survive), and a great remix of We All Sleep Alone. I can't stop listening to this CD!"
5,Music fan from Cols. Oh.,This CD is HOT!!!!!!!!!!!! Cher is back on top and better than ever. Yea DISCO!
4,Absolutely fabulous!,I recently discovered Cher through a friend (while painting of all things). This album is amazing. It is literally 10 tracks of gay dance goodness! She has reinvented herself with this peppy new upbeat album. Buy it!
3,Believe?,"I like the song believe on this cd. That is the main reason that I purchased it. The bad thing is, I don't think she would sound that good if it weren't for the electronic voice sound effects. After awhile the voice enhancer gets to be a little old. Of course if you can change the sound of your voice and it keeps you in the music industry more power to you."
3,Cher is getting oldly young !!,"No that bad... There are some nice songs found in this album but in the long run gets tiresome. It's quite of the same rhythm... Play, rewind, forward.... or skip it ;)"
3,NOT BAD; NOT BETTER THAN DIANA'S,"I think Believe was remarkable hit, so was Strong enough. Cher knew exactl;y what she was doing to get on the radio. The album, though, does not fit with her hits. When I buy an album, I have to like all the songs and this one for me was a let down. Diana Ross's ""Every days is a new day"" is better because of more vocal talent. Sorry Cher, at least BELIEVE was a #1 hit"
4,Cher drags it out/dusts it off/strikes gold one more time!,"Cher has been around for decades, and yet, she still has the talent to put it out there one more time. Some of the music on this CD is as 70s as Angel Flights pants and wide collar polyester shirts. But the title song and the remix of We All Sleep Alone are worth the purchase price alone!"
5,cher is so kool,i love thais song it does not sound like cher at all that is not why cher a a wonderful voice
3,Surprise! Surprise! says Gomer Pyle.,"Quite a change for a chanteuse. Quite like it, sometimes a lot, sometimes not so much. Some songs are ""gems"". The flow of the albumcould have more of a punch, but it sounds alright to listen toon those ""chill out at home"" kind of vibe. Lovely girl, with a ""come hiter"" voice makes me feel so nice.yeah."
1,Not what I expected in a blanket.,"After using this blanket for the past month, I found it to be light weight which is one of the reasons why I purchased it, but certainly doesn't move with you as you toss about during the night. The material feels like thin foam and is not pliable. In fact it already has a slight nick in the foam. It certainly doesn't feel like fabric. If it hadn't been used, I would return it."
5,Excellent blanket - very warm,"This blanket is very thin, yet very warm. The only complaint I might have is that it is very slick so the comforter tends to slide around a lot on it during the night. This may change as it gets washed more. While it is similar to the blankets you see in hotels, it is much higher quality."
3,Dirty,"This item was clearly displayed out of the package for sometime on a self. There are dust/dirt stains and fading on the folded sides from what I'll assume from sunlight. This item was new to my knowledge but was very dusty and dirty. I have not tried to wash out yet as I'be been too upset to deal with it. BE AWARE! I guess the description must say ""NEW IN PACKAGE"" ""Never Been Opened"" to get that type item. (...) dollar item but I still expected it to be pristine, which it was not."
4,Light blankets,"Washable, light weight, very warm, feel good blanket. Special bonus - excellent for allergy sufferers!"
3,The product is ok,"The blankets are fine but not as good quality as the ones I purchased about 19 years ago. They will suffice, however."
5,Heaven,"If you've never had a Vellux blanket what in world are you waiting for! Absolutely the softest and most comfortable blanket on the market. And, all you pet lovers whose animals sleep on the bed as ours do, dog hair wipes off immediately! Unlike most blankets where you almost have to pick each individual hair off the blanket, just moisten a little towel or even your fingers and wipe it all into a little pile and throw away. SIMPLE! The more you wash it the softer it gets. 5 star Hotels use these and it's no wonder why! Buy one today, you won't be sorry!"
1,Digital Darkroom for Windows by Global Star Software,"I wasted my money on this one. There's definitely something wrong. What's described in the little manual and what actually shows up when you run the program are two different things. Either I got a defective, or wrong CD or the manual is the wrong one. I would love to have someone take a look at this. I wouldn't even think of trying to sell this program using your service. I wouldn't do that to anyone. I just want people to be aware of this software by Global Star."
4,Everyman's Guide to the Garand,"This is good introduction to the Garand, a good review of things the old hand might have missed along the way, and not a half bad read. Well worth the money.Hatcher's ""Book of the Garand"" is another good one, and Kuhnhausen's book "".30 Caliber Service Rifles"" is exhaustive.I like 'em all."
4,A collection of articles,"As the title states this is a collection of articles written for a magazine. Having said that is does provide help and information, There are many difrent ways to help improve your rifles performance and most of them are listed here, from the simple do at home to the ""I better have a gunsmith do it"". Overall worth the investment."
2,"Nothing to see here, keep moving...",Book is a compilation of dated magazine articles. Poorly written and very few illustrations. Have not found one useful bit of info for my Garand. Not worth the money unless you are very good at figuring things out from a text description alone and you have advanced gunsmithing skills. You can find more useful diy info for free on the Internet.
3,A Bicycle of Cathy.,"It is a pleasant book though, seems to be written from a woman's point of view More of a romance than an adventure story. A book written for younger people. Has some woman's rights undertones. It is an easy read and has nice pictures."
4,Good rumba practice disc,We are new to ballroom dance and needed music for practice at home. This has many good rumba tunes.
1,A false title,"Whoever titled this CD: Rumba has no knowledge about music and should learned about rythm and how and why they are different from each other. I'm really dissapointed, because a bought a ""hoax"" disc. My recommendation to the people who made this CD should go to Music 101."
3,"It's rumba, but it's pretty cheesy.","I teach intro ballroom dancing to college students and needed more rumba music for teaching. These do, of course, have rumba rhythms, so the CD is still useful, but some of the songs are pretty cheesy. I would have preferred something a little more interesting musically, but perhaps I should have known better just by looking at the cover!"
3,Home Video to DVD....,"For a movie with a budget this low, it was actually very impressive. It looked like a group of friends went camping for the weekend, got sauced, and came up with this idea for a movie. It was good in a really funny/retarded way. I think that I write stories that have a better storyline than this.Now the acting, it wasn't that too bad, but it was bad. I did not know that the person who was the killer would end up being it, but I did know that the helper person had something to do with the killings, and I think that it had a twist-kind of-in the end.If you like movies that are suppose to be scary, but are acutually funny as hell,and movies that look like they were made on a maximum $1,000 budget, check this movie out,, but if you like movies that actually look like they took more than a week to make, stay the hell away from this. In my view. I liked this movie, but I don't have the same opinion as a lot of people."
5,hilarious,"i honestly can't remember the last time i laughed this hard at a movie.people are looking way to far into this, but in reality, if you can't laugh at this you don't have a sense of humor. it is right up there with return of the living dead."
1,Terrible,This movie had little gore with a terrible plot. I would cut my eyes out before watching this Home Video again. Please save your money and buy a real horror movie
1,Eberrasing,"If you but the anaglyph version of this then you are a fool. The anaglyph version cuts out all the nudity which is what made the original version popular. Besides, the anaglyph version doesn't work at all. The images aren't assembeled well. It's a waste of time unless you can find an original disc. This anaglyph version is a waste of time."
4,There is a better Lychee candy,"These are nice because they have a subtle flavor, but I like the flavor to linger on such a mild candy. I really like Kasugai Litchi (Lychee) Hard Candies better. This is a nice gummy candy because it does not stick to teeth. I really like Lychee fruit like the other person. I have had them at restaurants. Orange Flavor gummies are really better because they are more intense flavor and that is what I like in a gummy I have decided."
2,I don't really like this Lychee Gummy candy.,I don't really like this Lychee Gummy candy. I ate real Lychee last year in China. But this candy tasted weird. My kids and my husband didn't like the flavor either. My son said there were some white powers on the candy. Better be another one if you are looking for some Asian snacks.
5,Inspirational reading,"I am the author of the book and wanted to add these letters that I have received about my book.PaulI just wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed ""Happy Birthday Mr. Sidney"" What a GREAT book. It grabbed my attention from the very beginning and kept it till the very end. I had a hard time putting the book down. In fact, I finished reading it in less than a week. That's amazing for me because I NEVER read. It made me think about how I treat people at times, and not take people or time for granted. They are precious gifts. YOU are an inspiring writer. Thank youJackieAnother letter sent to the Author:PaulWhat a wonderful story. Sure makes you take a second look at ones life. Thanks to you I will never take anything for granted & will try to love & fulfill my loved ones with love & caring. I do believe in angels. They are around us & do hear us, guiding us everyday. So thanks for the GREAT BOOK. Can't wait for the next one.Carol"
5,She's a Pro,"Of all the writing books out there, I was so pleased that I chose this one. Lerner has, to my mind, some of the most lucid and inspiritaional arguments for persisting as a writer. The only thing I can compare it to is John Gardner's The Art of Fiction, which my very well be out of print. It's like having a step-sister in the publishing industry."
1,Very Little Light,"This rather tedious book is long on (the author's) vanity and short on new or helpful advice. Read Anne Lamott, Joan Didion, and Natalie Goldberg instead."
5,"Honest and funny, Definitely a must have.","This book has been cracking me up for days. It's honest and funny, it's sad and true. I can pick myself out in the various types of writers she mentions and that also makes me laugh.To the people who say they're not crazy and feels that Lerner talks down and condescends, I disagree. I feel like she's just being honest. For example, when she says, ""the only place you'll find more alcoholics than an AA meeting is a writing conference"", that's hilarious! I had a great chuckle out of it. Honestly, my fellow writers, does it not make sense? I don't drink, but I can see how trying to write might drive somebody to it! Loosen up and laugh. Don't waste your time being offended, take her advice and enjoy the book. It gives me hope that someday I'll see some things of mine published."
5,Beyond Spectacular,"About writers and publishing, Betsy Lerner is the best author that breaths oxygen on this planet. Hilarious, true, like a mix of a cattle prod and a lullaby, Lerner will coax you into writing another line and coach you on pushing your finished product through the publishing houses. Betsy is the only woman I love dearly that I've never met. I've read her book many, many times. If your one of my friends, No, you may not borrow my copy. I didn't even loan it to sister. Buy it, read it, live it!"
3,Helpful points for Writers,"I found this book helpful in steering novice writers in the correct direction to capturing the important aspects of their subject. It is difficult for first-time authors to bring forth the essence of what should be interesting to an audience unfamiliar with the particular area of work for which they intend to address.I haven't arrived at the stage of searching out a publisher.Although,this is also covered in the book.I recommend this for first-time authors. Definitely."
2,"Physician, Heal Thyself","It is difficult to take some of her advice seriously. I was at an event where Lerner embarrassed a writer in the audience with a nasty joke after she asked about the ethics of changing agents. The event continued to focus on the red-faced person in the audience, who Lerner lambasted for being like a boyfriend or spouse with no loyalty or staying power. Funny, then, that her second book is with a different agent than her first. Hmmm... how solid is the advice? And if her second book is about feeling like boyfriends didn't stick with her...then how muchof what she has to say is really based on her own bitter agenda? Some of the advice in here is good, but alot of it is skewered . It is also a little fuddy duddy (Calling the reader ""dear reader"")"
1,Some Good Points But Bad Comments,"I am writer so I thought I would pick this book up. At first glance it seemed to have some important information and a positive slant, but further examination proved otherwise. Sadly, Ms Lerner goes out of her way to say critical remarks about authors that I found personally offensive. For example: ""Writers love to worry. By their very nature they are neurotic."" And if this isn't enough another blast, one out of many I might add, comes later on: ""The only place you're likey to find more alcoholics than an AA meeting is in a writing program."" She consistently uses a broad brush in painting authors as having pychological problems and being indecisive and makes no aplogies for these harsh generalizations. It seems to me that the author goes out of her way to insult her audience and the people who have provided her a living for many years. After all, Ms. Lerner states that authors create and editors just provide energy, but does that energy have to be negative?"
3,Could have been better,"This book had a hard time keeping my attention. It is of course, short stories from the men who were there and originally written to be read by other soldiers only, in a soldiering magazine, circa 1944. I felt ""The Thousand Mile War,"" was much better written and left me with a better understanding of the battle for Attu. Now, please understand some of the soldiers stories were very interesting, but more of them weren't, in my opinion."
1,Poor quality and false adverising,"This horseshoe set is cheap, the shoes are not steel, as advertised, but cast iron, and they break quite easily. Waste of money and Halex is refusing to send replacement parts. Total waste of money. Product is definitely not steel.Halex Classic Horseshoe Set"
1,girlfiend broke shoe in 1/2 hour,"I didn't expect the best shoe set for $29.99, but I certainly didn't expect my girlfriend to break it on the third game. I'd like a replacement set by Monday July 25th."
1,BROKE - FIRST USE,"2 of the 4 horseshoes broke in half during the first (normal) use. They are not solid steel, it looks more like some sort of composite type of material. Would not reccommend, sorry."
1,HALEX HORSESHOES,"These horseshoes are horrible !!! I have even bought a couple of sets, but they keep breaking!! bad casting on their part! DO NOT BUY! SPEND EXTRA MONEY AND BUY BETTER ONES!"
2,Beware of what you are ordering,I play in leagues and having different color horseshoes is nice. This set said it was red and blue so I ordered them. The first shippment showed up and they were not colored at all more of a grey/black steel color. Amazon sent out a replacement set and they were also uncolored. They also didn't seem like the strongest set that I've ever played with. Wouldn't order again.
3,not as pictured,"This Horseshoe set is just about perfect in every way. However, I chose this set above all others because I wanted the red and blue set. The set that was shipped was two shades of grey. I purchased it for a Memorial Day BBQ so I didn't have time to return or exchange it for the red and blue set. Again they worked fine, and we enjoyed them, I just wish they would have been red and blue."
1,Poor Quality Cast Steel - Broke Immediately,"Third time using these horseshoes, one of them broke in half when it hit the pole. Very dissapointing, no more horseshoes this camping trip. These things look good when you buy them, but very poor quality cast metal."
3,Watered-Down Jellyfish,"Sure, they're talented. But, I can't ignore the fact that Jellyfish was doing much the same type of material almost 10 years ago with songs and arrangements that are far more interesting and inventive than those of the Marvelous 3. Sorry, but I gotta be honest."
2,Disappointed,"To be sure, I originally expected alot out of this CD due to their first single, ""Freak of the Week"". However, this is another one of those albums that I went out to buy because of that catchy tune I heard on the radio and got suckered into a $15.00 investment that was put away after the first week of listening to <come on, we all do it now and then>... There are a few songs that are worth listening to, and most of the album's music is good, but the corny lyrics make most of it intolerable. At best this is an album that delves into mediocrity and the band will most likely fall into the one-hit abyss column ... If you wanna hear something good within this musical realm, listen to any David Bowie album; afterall he's the ones they copied ... Then again, thats just my opinion!"
4,Strong,"Hey!Album is packed with 12 solid cuts. It is refreshing to see the trend of one..maybe two hit cds with 8 songs of filler, is finally changing. The marvelous3 have a collection of catchy, driving tunes. There is nothing like a 3 member power trio. In addition, the recording quality lends itself to to flavor and feel of the music. I greatly enjoyed this cd."
5,rock music with a punk rock attitude.,"butch walker is the king of pop music.check out the song my way from the album left of self-centered, you'll love it!!"
5,Top 12 reasons why Marvelous 3's hey! album is a great album,"Top 12 reasons why Marvelous 3's hey! album is a great album! 1. You're so Yesterday 2. Freak of the Week 3. Until You See 4. Write it on your hand 5. Let me Go 6. Every Monday 7. Indie Queen 8. #27 9. Mrs. Jackson 10. Over Your Head 11. Vampires in Love 12. LemonadeIt's not too often you see a REAL rock tri. Example - Everclear, touring guitarist, keyboardist, guy hitting a crash cymbal onstage; Goo Goo Dolls - touring guitarist, keyboardistOn behalf of the band Protocol, I would like to say that hey! album is excellent, but is the blueprints to the marvelous 3's stage show. You haven't lived until you see Marvelous 3 onstage. Go get tickets now before they ""tell you they sold out!"""
5,the hey! album is an extremely kool!,"all of the songs on this cd rock except mrs. jackson that is not a personal favorite. i fell in love with these guys when ""freak of the week"" was released and am very glad i bought this cd. i listen to it all the time"
5,One of the best new bands this year!!!,m3 is great !!!! their new single freak of the week is very good !!! I hope they keep coming out w/ new great songs as good as this one!!!
3,"Catchy, but not great.","This CD is good, no doubt. It's not great, though. It's one of those CD's with high-points and low-points which just don't have the spark of energy that makes you feel the music. Never-the-less, songs such as You're So Yesterday, Freak of the Week, Every Monday, and Indie Queen are very good songs. Every Monday being the best on the album. All the other songs have catchy lyrics and everything, but they just aren't as good. It's hard to explain. There are good harmonies with the vocals. The big problem is that there isn't the right energy, I feel. Like on ""#27"", during the verse there is a walking bassline with an occasional note on the guitar. The vocals on every song will be imprinted in your mind for atleast an hour after every listen. They sound very good in their vocals. The music is average. I give them 3 stars."
5,hey! album,"this albums rocks I met the marvelous 3 at the ""ORGY"" gig in nyc and we hung out together behind all of the crowds and talked about the HEY! Album this album is great and they are a upcomming band that the world will get to know in a few years I also seen them live in Altantic City and they put on one hell of a show . Watch this band and buy their cd's and see them live you will find out how great their music is ."
3,OK But Not Great,"Fairly good hard power pop/corporate rock in the 70s style, in other words, the Marvelous 3 sound like a modern version of Cheap Trick or the Knack. A fairly good version, but not exactly earthshaking, this is not a band that will change your life. But if you long for the good old days of pop hard rock you will be quite pleased. Very similar to like minded band Tsar but a little more interesting. Quite listenable but not really my thing. Bets tracks are `Freak Of The Week' `Every Monday' and `Indie Queen'"
2,O.K Nothing great,I was hoping this CD would be like A place in the Sun by Lit. The tunes were catchy but too slow for my taste. #2 Freak of the Week was the best song on the CD. Your so yesterday was alright. If you want some real rock 'n' roll go for Lit or Blink 182
4,almost as good as third eye blind!,"The marveluos 3 are great. Lot's of people compare them to third eye blind (who are awesome!) I don't see why everyone is giving them such a bad rap. Some people say that there's no emotion in it, but these are all just really fun songs. It gets really boring if all that people sing about is how aweful their lives are and that crap, like most of the other alternative/rock bands out there. I'm pretty open minded with music and like just about anything except for rap. This is a good album and I would recomend it to people who are into the punk/rock type of stuff"
4,THIS CD COMES DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO 5 STARS!!!,"Led by a Trent Reznor look-a-like, MARVELOUS 3 is anything but new and trendy. In fact, they're throw backs. But throwbacks to a great time! YOU""RE SO YESTERDAY, WRITE IT ON YOUR HAND, OVER YOUR HEAD,227 etc...all have that pre-new wave GRAHAM PARKER, JOE JACKSON sound that at once make them memorable and singable!LET ME GO & FREAK OF THE WEEK are both thinly disguised, clever tunes that sound great!In fact the only songs I didn't care for were UNTIL YOU SEE & LEMONADE. But even the worst of the cd far exceeds the post grunge, where do we go from here musically crap that we've been forced to listen to these past few years!!!!"
4,Lots of fun for your ears!,"This glam/pop/rock fun trio definetly makes it count with this release, Hey!. Tying in a little bit of all kinds of fun rock they crank out tunes like Mrs. Jackson, Over Your Head, Vampires In Love, and Let Me Go for slower paced songs. Marvelous 3 is definetly a fun CD to add to your music collection."
5,Totally Awsome,"Marvelous 3 is the best band i have heard in a long time. m3 and Eve6 are my most favorite bands to ever rock. For those of you who don't like them come to music midtown, April 30th thru May 2nd. M3 kicks A**."
5,One of the best albums I have bought this year,"I love anything by Marvelous 3. We need more Power Pop music these days. Check out ""You're so Yesterday"" and you'll know what I mean. There isn't one track on this album that I don't like. The boys from Georgia really know how to rock!"
1,disappointed,"I thought this DVD was a movie called ""Bruce Lee, the Man the Myth"" that starred Bruce Li as Bruce Lee in a recreation of his life. I was wrong. There is no character called Butchie, Bruce doesn't have multiple endings, and this Bruce doesn't go around parading the Chinese and the superiority of Kung Fu nor does he kick arse. This completely different movie is kind of about Bruce Lee but this Bruce keeps losing fights and the movie is just plain bad.Besides being mistaken for another movie, the DVD is very plain and bare bones. The video and audio quality is expectedly poor."
1,Worse than x10,"I bought this because my lights in the bathroom would occasionally not work. I have two vanity lights controlled together with an x10 wall switch. I ""upgraded"" to this unit to get more reliability but it only worked <5% of the time instead of the >95% with the older x10 unit. I called tech support to see if I was doing something wrong. They were very nice, but told me nothing I didn't already know. The unit was just not up to par. I sent it back."
4,"Incorrect picture, Actual item has no mounting tabs","I ordered two of these InlineLinc dimmers and planned to mount them in a standard switch box with a blank cover. However the items received didn't have any mounting tabs at all. That could be an advantage if you need to fit them into a confined space inside an appliance or light fixture, but it wasn't suitable for my application so I returned them.Lack of a solid mounting arrangement might also be the reason these units have a lower power handling rating than standard SwitchLincs."
4,Great Learning resource for K-3,The games presented in Mathtime Playtime have been played enthusiastically for many years by k-3 students at the Nueva School. The games have become an intergral part of the math curriculum at Nueva School and we decided to share them with other teachers and parents.
4,ISAN - Meet Next Life,"Bucolic is always a word that will apply to Isan, and their album MEET NEXT LIFE fits it to a tea, from the folk guitars of ""Birds Over Barges"" to the slow wind-up to ""One Man Abandon."" The rhythms are, as always, gentle and the melodies soothing. The hazy electronics of ""Gurnard"" recall a lazy summertime riverboat ride, while ""Gunnera"" is a brisk breeze on a cool day. The dreamy ""Snowdrops and Phlox"" conjures up more icicles than plant life, but it's still achingly delicate. The final, title track twinkles out like stars from distant galaxies. See you in the next life, then."
3,Buy any Isan release but this one.,"I love this group for their unique style of melodic IDM music, but of their 5(?) titles, this one I sold."
2,"Nice holster, but DOES NOT fit a S&W CS9 properly","I purchased this holster expecting to be able to carry my S&W; CS9 (Chiefs Special) 9mm semi-auto. The trigger guard area on the holster is too narrow to accommodate the wider trigger guard of the gun making the seam of the plastic holster separate. While it does technically fit, because the seam is actually 2 pieces at that point, it is extremely difficult to draw without pulling the entire paddle portion up out of your pants.I returned it in hopes to find something a little closer fitting."
3,Not a good fit for me,"It is supposed to fit 3913,but it has to separate the plastic to fit in all the way. If I were going to go this route, I would probably go to a blackhawk next time."
5,Very cool CD and booklet!,I received this CD from my golf partner. It has an excellent supply of tips and suggestions on how to mentally play and prepare.The CD is full of tips that I now use all the time when I play. I need remind myself it is very cool that I can put the CD on in the car and the booklet is small enough to fit in my golf bag. I recommend this to anyone who likes reading tips on how to improve their golf game.
2,"""Golf between the ears"" with little in the book!",I bought this book as an Easter gift for my golfing Husbad and both he and I were very disappointed in the content. Factual points were given i.e. clear your mind before striking the ball BUT from a Psychologist we expected methods of how to do this. Everyone knows the fact - it is the operation of the instruction which is needed. Why put on audio exactly what is written in the book - not a book really just a pamphlet. NOT good value for money. I expected much more from a sports psychologist.
5,This book is a smart buy for the new writer,"I read this book when I first started writing, and it gave me many DO and DON'T suggestions. The author gives the reader short sections on each subject he thinks is important. I like that, but I wish the book had a better organization, so when I go back to read a certain passage, I'd know where to find it.BUT, it is STILL one of my favorite books."
3,not THAT great,"Yes, there are lots of things you can learn from in this book, but there is also some fluff, too. For example, I distinctly remember a part in here where he says something like ""don't write after having sex, you'll be tired."" Well duh! Anybody with half a head on their shoulders could have figured that one out. Anyway, as far as how-to-write books go, this one is only okay. It definitely reads fast. But I couldn't help wondering why I've never heard of this author before. I think he's written a bestseller or two, but that doesn't prove anything because I've read lots of bestselling and award-winning books that were absolutely rotten. I remember almost nothing about this book, except the part in quotations above and the fact that there was some humor, but I wanted a how-to-write book, not a comedy. If you ask me, the best how-to-write book is THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE by STRUNK and WHITE."
3,Very small,Better suited for a child or a small person. Luckily the person I am giving it to is small.
5,"I'M BEAUTIFUL, DAMMIT!!!","I'm not one for Bette Midler, but when I heard the Brimsley Evans Back to the Scene of the Crime remix, I knew I had to check it out. The song has an uplifting message with slightly narcissistic undertones, but you can still dance to it. What's unique about this is that Bette's not singing, but speaking throughout the song. Please try to find this if you are a dance fan. You won't be disappointed."
2,Where's Bette?,"Hey, the reason I listen to Bette is BETTE! The remix is slammin', but then I realized, where are the vocals? Sure, she makes an appearance here and there, but JEEZ. And it's not just this remix. This has become a trend in remixing lately, and I, for one, don't like it. Keep on giving us those hot beats, guys and girls, but PLEASE keep the vocals in! The I'm Beautiful remixes are for Bette completists ONLY! Anyone know of any remixes of I'm Beautiful out there that KEPT the vocals?"
2,Missed the overlap by a few feet,"A wonderfully written and presented book with all the glorious photos one would expect from a book describing the Cup. The history, while put forth in a concise and informative manner, comes to dominate the book. The book ends with a quick sketch of the chalangers and then abruptly ends. It fails to cover either the Louis Vinton or Americas Cup. Why a book on the challangers that doesnt document the challenge?"
3,A little bit restrained but a good book.,"Russell Coutts is New Zealand's greatest living yatchsman however not a great author but he really does try to bring out his passion for his love of match racing.As with his demenor in life, he is a little too humble in his writings but using the America's Cup history he and fellow author, Paul Larsen manage to produce a good coffee table book that is easy to read and leads you right up to the beginning of Challengers series that was a much better spectical than the next event three years later.All the participants are mentioned and technical talk and actions well explained.I felt that this book should have been released after the Americas Cup 2000 proper so the end results could have been added. Team New Zealand's only successful defence would have rounded out this book nicely. Of course Russell Coutts was at the healm of Black Magic at the time and we now know what happened three years later."
1,You must be kidding!,"These remakes done by The City of Prague Orch. are worthless. Thye come no where near the actual majesty of Bernstein's music. The original, or nothing."
2,Not to my liking.,Perhaps i was expecting too much after listening to other film composers.So i will put this in the play at a later time.
5,Love this,"I love this product. Although, I haven't been able to find it in stores. Amazon is the cheapest I've found to buy it. It makes you hair feel so soft and silky and easy to comb right after washing."
2,Not the best product,"Overall just ok, their are definately better wipes out there, read my other review of the Malaket brand."
4,Pug wrinkle folds,"I use this product to clean my pug's wrinkle folds and cleaning between baths. He does have allegry when the weather feels humid. It works very well to clean up the smell of his body and clear up the redness between his wrinkle folds. However, I found this item to have a very strong smell that my baby doesn't like when using on his face. He will try to get the smell off his face after I used it! But this is a good product and I do recommend this if you want your babies to smell nice between bathing with shampoos."
4,Must have for dogs with deep folds around their tails,"We have two english bulldogs, one whom has deep folds around here tail. These are a must have to ensure she is clean and skin allergy free."
1,"Cats hate these, stay away from them if you're a cat owner.","I bought these thinking ""oh hey, now I will be able to keep my cat super clean!"" WRONG, from the moment I opened up the bottle the cats were repelled by the towel smell. They really hate the smell and is really hard to keep them still while using it, so to the dump it went.Please do not waste your money on this if you're a cat owner."
3,DermaPet Malcetic Wet Wipes,"This is a great product, I have used it for several years to clean my Newfie's ears other parts of her body. I am very pleased with the results and will continue using it."
2,No good for feline stud tail...,"My prime motive for writing this is to dispute the ""Product Description"" on the main page.#1: Under NO circumstances should these wipes be used any where near the eyes and the same warning is clearly stated on the container's label.Use near the eyes will cause at least stinging and possibly worse discomfort for your pet. Warm water used with sterile pads or tear-stain products are the only cleansing products one should use near the eyes.#2: The wipes are also recommended for feline stud tail, but they do absolutely no good for this annoying malady.The main remedy for stud tail is to remove the build up of oils on a daily basis and unless one rubs vigorously with the Malacetic wipes, the grease does not budge. Stud tail is basically feline acne and every vet or dermatologist will warn against the temptation of rubbing the affected area.Unfortunately, washing the cat's tail with medicated pet shampoo and grooming daily is the only current solution."
3,Pet Bath Wipes,"Product was recommended by somebody who had used it when their dog was going through a skin allergy. Didn't help much, but could have been what our dogs were allergic to vs. their dog. Also, product wasn't advertised as a relief to allergy so it isn't there fault it didn't help us. Note: Product has a strong smell."
3,My cats HATE them,"I see that although this product claims to be for ""pets"" in general, all the comments so far are from dog owners; that may not be an accident.My two adolescent kittens are always finding their way into anything dirty, so I thought I could use these wipes to spot-clean their paws and faces in between proper baths. The problem is, I can't get a wipe *anywhere near* my usually highly groomable and unsquirmy cats. The wipes smell pleasant to me, if a bit cloying, but they must be unbelievably horrifying to a cat nose. The best I can do is swipe at one's back as it runs away.The cleanser also leaves a sticky residue, as others have noted. I'll probably end up giving these to a dog-owning friend."
4,Great pen,"I first bought the pen at a pharmacy and simply loved it. I had difficulty finding it (the pharmacy discontinued it). I googled and found it on Amazon.Writes extremely well. The 0.7 is great but I prefer the 0.5 better.The only thing is - every now and then, the pen's ink would explode on my hand. It happened about 1 in every 6 pens used. I initially thought it was the pressure from the airplanes as I travel a lot, but it happened at work with the pens left at the desk.. A bad flaw.But it is the best pen I have used (other than the pricey Mont Blancs and Waterman...)"
5,BEST.PEN.EVER.,"I first got my hands on this pen when my sister came to work with me. We would steal one pen off each others desk to use it. It's the best pen I have ever used, and I order them by the dozen. I'm hoarding them for fear that Bic will discontinue them. I've let a few people ""try"" mine they are instantly hooked. Now I give packs of these away as gifts. They are VERY difficult to find at office supply stores and the big ones around me don't carry them, but it's easier to order them on Amazon anyway. Oh, and I don't like the .7mm at all- too fat, just not the same. The .5 is the only way to go!"
2,Disappointing Blue Color,"This is a bit picky, I'm a big fan of the Z4+ .5mm in black, so I was interested in the blue. I'm really disappointed they made the physical pen color so light blue, when its the same dark blue/purple ink you can get in any pen. I ordered the pack because I wanted some non-black pens that weren't the same dreary color as regular ""blue"" pens.I feel BIC was a little deceptive in the bright blue design of the pen. Yes, this is a bit quirky, but I wish they'd not try to present it as a different color than standard pen 'blue'.It writes fine though, like the Z4+ .5mm line."
2,Product Not Available,"TNT needs to update their site with amazon.com advising that they do not currently carry this product. I purchased on 2/14/2012, and received an email notice on 2/15 advising my order had been canceled because the ""item is out of stock; if you're still interested in this item, please search for it again on amazon.com."""
2,uninspired and misdirected,"This book reminded me of The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing, in that it seemed to WANT to be a story of a woman finding herself, but didnt quite make it. A young woman is finally burnt out after pushing herself too hard for too many years. She has always lived in her head and wants to learn to live in her body. But at the end of the story the issues dont seem resolved, and in fact, some of the conclusions seem erroneous. There is an undertone of misdirected feminism that just seems confused.The supporting characters in this novel are delightful. The narrative is engaging. I just think the PLOT drags and falters. I would NOT recommend it to friends."
1,Disenchanted,"A roller coaster ride from the thrill of reading Necessary Madness to the utter disappointment of Letting the Body Lead. Lessons learned here as I purchased this book based on how much I loved Necessary Madness. Reading a few pages would have warned me not to bother with this book. In Letting the Body Lead Jenn Crowell displays an exaggerated need to impress professors critiquing her for a PHD by over filling the book with a vocabulary that doesn't match her audience. If she enjoyed writing this book it doesn't come through. I felt I was going through her suffering and insecurities looking for just the right synonym for an ordinary word. I purchased one for myself and one for a dear friend. I read until I just couldn't take the disappointment anymore, put it down and will donate both copies to the local library. It wouldn't feel right to give this to a friend as I wouldn't want it associated with my preference in good reading. Save your money."
3,"""Letting The Body Lead""leads the way","Letting The Body Lead is a well rounded exploration to being too young, too gifted, and too confused how this adds up to being a woman in today's world. Sexuality seems available, but how to connect the sensual and the intellectual...and the scared little girl inside? Peopled with characters every woman has probably run into or dated, and will recognise, Letting The Body Lead entertains while taking us to Iceland. A peek into personal growth through relationships, and how another culture can teach us what our own may have neglected, Letting The Body Lead is a gentle but entertaining trip into Icelandic living, and a young woman's growth through loving."
4,refreshing,"Frankly, I have only read the Metamorphosis and the Penal Colony. I will admit that both were a bit unusual, but I fell in love with the Penal Colony. It's laconic, but extremely well-written (kudos to the translator). Given it's length, I'd suggest it to anyone looking for a shortcut to one of literature's masterpieces. As for the Metamorphosis, I cannot say the same. God only knows (as Kafka cannot tell us) what he meant with the transformation of Gregor into a vermin. I found that story simply bizarre, devoid of any blatant parallel."
5,Best Translation of Metamorphosis,"I have read three translations of the Metamorphosis and this one is definitely the best. I love Kafka. I read his stuff again and again. And I certainly am not an ""high blown intellectual."" I am a 68 year old mother of 8 and grandmother of 13. I did not discover Kafka until last year, though it had been in my library for 30 years. You know, one of those books you were supposed to read but felt deep down it would probably be boring. I should have read it years ago, but better late than never. I know lots of people like Gregor, they attach themselves to you and bleed you dry and all the while doing what's ""good for you."" I sometimes think Kafka is as much poetry as prose. He's on my top 10 writers."
5,A perfect balance of satire and philosophy,"I will keep this relatively short. Through his short stories, kafka shows the brilliance of including his twisted existential philosophy while at the same time providing humor in a satirical way. Whether he is slyly critisizing right winged fanatics in ""in the penal colony"" or man's obsession with appearance in ""the metamorphosis"", all of his stories maintain a great deal of integrity. This is a must read."
5,Schupak's Best Work Yet! Little League Coaches Take Notice!,"If you buy only one of Marty Schupak's baseball DVDs,this is the one it should be! He took a common senseapproach to mistakes we all see on the Little League fieldand shows how to correct them. Perfect!"
5,This album is a classic addition to any blues collection.,"Putumayo unveils the connection between Mali and Memphis that was always there but not always sufficiently appreciated. I find myself listening to the almost hypnotic track ""Mon Amour, Ma Cherie"" over and over. Johnny Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters never sounded better. Absolutely beautiful! Triumph and strength over sadness!"
3,Good overview but not always accesible,"This biography gives a good overview of T.H. White's life and works but Sylvia Warner's writing style is sometimes difficult and dense. She is able to convey White's pain and emotional difficulties with vividness. I suspect White suffered from Asperger's syndrome in addition to alcoholism, and repressed homosexuality. She probably could have expanded the section on his childhood and adolescence. Of course the book centers on the Once and Future King. She provides insight and reveals nuances in his most famous work but doesn't explain why he didn't finish revising it and why he abandoned the Book Of Merlyn. I wanted to know why he altered the Sword in the Stone to it's detriment and why the publisher never included the Book of Merlyn in the Once and Future King if that was his intention."
3,nostaglic I bet,these movies mostly are very dated but there are a few gems in this collection... and they really should have subtitles but don't
4,Great,"Read this,by all means,if you would like to read a good and fun SVH book.Jess and Lila try to decide who they should go to the prom with by starting a rating system,sorting hotties from losers.When the boys find out,they are furious and is Jessica still popular with boys??...Nuh-uh!!!"
5,"Exciting, Betrayal, Hurt, and just a great book.","The Junior is coming to a close and that Elizabeth doesn't know who to go with. Todd Wilkins-her beloved long time ex-boyfriend who had always been there for her- or Devon Whitelaw. The man who swept her of her feet. The Junior prom is almost here and she can't decide! Jessica, however, is ready to get the hottest date in the world! When some guys at Sweet Valley High blow her off will Jessice ever find a date before it's too late?"
4,pretty neat,this one of the sweetvalley series can be read to keep in tune with the series. the book revolves around the upcomin' prom and jessica and liz's date dilemmas. jessica has an ingenious idea she along with Lila rate the dudes of SVU. liz has to choose between todd and devon whitelaw.
2,Bad remastering spoils otherwise nice editions,"Barry Smith's Conan series is one of my favorites, but the Dark Horse color editions don't really measure up. The colorists for these volumes laid it on a bit thick, the result being a lot of muddied and/or obscured linework. There were many, many pages where the original artwork was blurred to the point of being unrecognizable. Smith's artwork deserves better treatment. BTW, for whatever reason, none of the covers are reproduced here. It seems an odd omission. If you're a Barry Smith fan, you'd be better served by picking up the Essential Conan. Fifteen dollars gets you 25 issues and covers, with all of Barry Smith's lovely artwork left intact."
4,Excellent reprints,"The reprints here have put 2005 production values onto 1970 comics--resulting in clear lines and vibrant (perhaps too much) color. If you never read these back in the 1970s, you're in for a treat--you'll see the development of Barry Smith as an artist--comparable only to Jim Steranko on S.H.I.E.L.D. or Frank Miller on Daredevil. My only real criticism is that they didn't reprint the great Smith covers. If they don't want to promote Marvel, they could've covered the logo. The covers alone were worth the 15 cents we originally paid."
4,Super Reader,"This is the first eight issues of the Marvel comics from the seventies, and includes the title story, and 7 others, including Thomas' adaptations of a couple of other Howard short pieces.The interesting thing is that he says he was trying to get Lin Carter's Thongor first, but his agent stalled, and he wrote to Glen Lord because he saw his name in the Conan paperbacks, and Lord said ok for Conan, for only slightly more money.Buscema and Kane were too expensive after that, to use as artists, so he chose Barry Windsor Smith."
4,The early comic classics get the treatment they deserve!,"Finally, someone has seen fit to give these sword-and-sorcery comic classics the treatment they deserve! Dark Horse has restored the classic artwork of Barry Smith and utilized modern digital colorization to render the definitive published versions.While Smith's early work is a bit derivative or evocative of Jack Kirby, it's fascinating to see his stylistic development nevertheless.Roy Thomas did the fantasy world a great service adapting Conan onto the comics page, with his crisp writing that shows he has a keen ear for the spirit of Robert E. Howard's work.Pour yourself a flagon of wine and savor these Conan classics, by crom!"
4,"Solaris 9 System Administrator Exam Cram 2 (Exam Cram 310-014, Exam Cram 310-015)","Straight to the point, precise and effective."
1,General unix overview - USELESS for the exam!,"It's a general overview of Solaris. If you want an intro to unix, great. If you want to pass the test, forget it. Not one of the practice questions was even remotely close to any of the exam questions. If you want the overview just buy a used copy of the v6, v7, or v8 version at your local used book store.If you know anything about solaris just goto [the website] and get their study guide. It's a little more expensive, but it at least has SOME of the real questions and it will give you a chance to pass."
4,oscar peterson-fred astaire Norgran sessions,"Swift delivery of scarce product....excellent remastering of historic collaboration. Still, it'sfunny how much more exciting things sounded when first heard 50 years ago in your youth."
5,THE KID RIDES ON,"I became curious about William Bonney, AKA Billy the Kid, when I first saw the movie Young Guns starring Emilio Estevez. I loved the movie but wanted to know how much of the story was Hollywood hype and how much of it was history.Accordingly I found Utley's book on Billy the Kid and found, to my satisfaction, that not only was much of the Young Guns story was accurate but that the life of Billy the Kid was as interesting and complex as any to be found in the annals of the Old West.The debate rages on as to whether young Billy was a poor, misunderstood folk hero or whether he was an ignorant, bloodthirsty miscreant who needs to be vilified and forgotten. Utley's well-researched and well-written book takes a multi-faceted approach to considering the complex history of young man who, despite is very short life and his even briefer career, continue to spark the imagination over a century after his death."
1,Ridiculous,It;s completely ridiculous to spend 7 bucks on 1 peice of paper and 24 small name tabs. don't waste the money.
1,"rifle builder's products, muzzle loader, rifle finishing","This product is difficult to use in that one must heat the entire barrel of the rifle or muzzle-loader full length to a high (200 degrees F or so) and consistent temperature. Then, while applying the product, one must maintain that heat in the barrel long enough to make that application smooth and bubble, overlap free. Frankly, after reading those instructions, I chose NOT to use the product out of fear that I would stain the barrel in an erratic and undesireable way. It may be easier and less prone to mistake than the instructions led me to believe but to those wishing to use it, I would first consult someone who does this for their livelihood or at least someone who has truly had some experience with it. It may be a lot easier than it seems to me but I didn't want to chance blemishing my heirloom rifle with the combination of the product and my own amateur restoration abilities."
5,CHOIR STORIES - HYDRANGEAS,Great book! Love this series of stories! These are safe for my granddaughters to read...thank you!!! Will look for more!
3,Lara's Hits Played By Others,"Augustin Lara, the famous singer from Vera Cruz, had a magical voice and style. This collection of his hits would be great at a restaurant as backround music, because the songs just don't have the magic of the famed Augustin Lara. All 12 songs are in Spanish and are well played/sung by Los Galantes, Los Montejo, Los Tecolines, Los Cancioneros Del Sur, Hnos. Martinez Gil, Los Tres Caballeros, Los Dandys, Los Soberanos, Los Tres Diamantes, Los Fantasmas, Los Tres Ases, and Los Guaracheros De Oriente."
2,Hardly symphonic.,"This CD suffers from the number one ailment of most symphonic tribute albums; it is only symphonic in the loosest, most liberal sense of the definition. I think a lot of listeners would agree that symphonic tribute albums should not be performed by ""orchestras"" which include electric guitars, bass guitars, synthesizers, or drum kits. Listening to a symphony's re-creation of a rock song should enhance the experience and expand the breadth of its reaches, not merely change some of the instruments."
1,Total trash - get the London Philharmonic album of 1995 instead,This album takes the beauty out of classical music and covers it with cheese. This represents what Kenny G did to jazz.I'll keep the criticism brief as many before me have expanded upon it. However I will highly recommend the 1995 London Philharmonic effort. It's a beautiful CD.
1,I can live without this.,"I don't know. It is such a promising idea and such a mediocre delivery.Consider the texture and space in the intro of Time from the original Dark Side of the Moon.The power of the simple but mind-blowing arrangement of ""In the Flesh"" from the Wall.They have managed to make it all sound like a MIDI arrangement.It isn't even close to being impressive.Maybe... Maybe, had George Martin arranged and Alan Parsons engineered, this could have been something."
4,Great,"I love this item the illustrations really make you understand the algebric cincept better, great item well worth the price."
4,"Kinison: always irreverant, always hilarious!","This was Kinison's final comic album prior to his untimely death in 1992. I'm guessing that he recorded this performance shortly before his death, as it contains many references to events of the early 1990s, most notably the Gulf War. In the opening piece, Kinison talks about how he was vilified for missing an appearance on the Joan Rivers show, and he compares himself to other entertainers whose sins have clearly exceeded his own (eg, Pee Wee Herman). This is funny stuff, although some of the references are quite a bit dated, especially the ongoing belittling of the Russians/Kurds. And as usual, Kinison can get pretty gross at times, but unlike many comedians before and since, his material is always more funny than it is raunchy. This album may not be quite as good as Kinison's earlier releases, yet it is still a must-have for his fans, as it is a small piece of the hilarity which remains from a comic genius who was taken from us much too soon."
4,This CD is good.,"Its really good, If you wanna know why, Look at the other reviews, But I gave it 4 stars because ITS ALL ON ONE TRACK! you cant switch to a different part. But it is really funny."
3,An acceptable climax to a good career though we need more,"This one's worth it just for the gay Terminator cracks. As always, something to wet yourself over. I was expecting a lot so at times my smile fell away in disappointment. On second listening I was more comfortable with it and let new stuff seep in with more relaxed understanding. ""Have You Seen Me Lately?"" has more laugh per dollar but this is no waste of time. By all means - if you love Sam - this belongs on your rack."
4,One of Sam's best!,This came out after Sam Kinison died and it still makes me laugh after countless listenings. This gets raw at times and his remedy for the homeless situation will either be one of the funniest things you ever heard or one of the most offensive. I think it's one of the funniest. Bob Hope fans stay away but the rest of us will listen and remember a true comic genius.
1,Don't ever buy this blanket,"I love the vellux blankets and was looking for a dark blue to replace one we have had for four years. When I took this blanket out of the package, there was a strong smell, and since it would be close to my head and nose, I washed it in warm water as it said. The blanket disintegrated like a buffalo molts all in my washing machine, and the smell was worse. There were pieces of blanket lining my machine. I left to do errands and my husband put it in the dryer so we could send it back, and the head ache and the dizziness I immediately experienced was incredibly intense. I thought I was ill, until I went outside, and then realized that whatever was causing my 'illness' was in our studio. The blanket continued to disintegrate in our dryer into blue fuzz. So now both of our machines were compromised....We had to vaccuum out with a shop vac.DO NOT BUY THIS BLANKET!!!! I have no idea what toxic material is in it, but you do not want this in your home!"
1,Harsh,I wish I can return this product. The blanket is stiff and of the quality that one finds in cheap motels. Not a good product.
2,"What is vellux, anyway?","I'll admit that I was ignorant regarding exactly what ""vellux"" is. I expected a fleece-like feel of softness. It is soft if you just touch the surface, but the fabric itself feels more stiff like a piece of foam. The edges of the blanket aren't finished at all, just like a piece of foam. If you gather it up, it feels stiff, even after washing. To me, this feels cheap and isn't comfortable.On the good side, I didn't notice any smell and there was only a little lint in the lint trap after the initial wash and dry of this blanket. If you don't mind the feel of vellux, you'll probably be fine with this blanket."
1,Vellux Blanket - not what I expected,Very dissatisfied...when i received blanket the plastic packaging it was in was very dusty. It seems like it had been sitting in a warehouse for years. The smell of the blanket was even worst. I have several of these blankets at home and I have never purchased one that had these problems.The ones I own are also much softer. I will return this one and purchase it elsewhere.
4,Great product but colour not accurate...,"Great product, exactly as I expected but it is more of a cream colour rather then white. Still highly recommended."
5,Martex Vellux Twin Blankets,"I used them for my grandchildren when they came for a visit and they were better than I had expected. They are extremely warm blankets, good quality and stitched well. It was the perfect length for my twin beds."
3,blanket,must have been stored a long time/set in fold lines/needed two washing with fabric softener to make it look presentable/sits and the foot of the bed in my quest room as an extra blanket
1,Not the Same Martex Vellux Blanket of 5 Years Ago,"I currently own two Martex Vellux blankets that I bought about 5 years ago, but they both have holes from dog chewing. I decided to replace them with a new one as a test because I had read all of the bad reviews about these blankets recently. The one-star reviews hit the nail on the head! The new blanket I received is nothing like the previous two I own ... it is thinner than before, scratchy and unpleasant to touch (unlike the velour feeling of the previous ones), and a horrible chemical smell remains after washing. I was not comfortable breathing in the smell and loose fibers (which appeared after washing) all night while sleeping. The blanket will be returned to amazon.com this week. I am also going to write a letter to the manufacturer, but I strongly suggest that amazon.com discontinue these substandard products to not hurt their own stellar reputation!"
2,Problems,We have had this blanket for a couple of months and while its really soft and comfortable today we pulled it from the washing machine and there were little pieces of fabric all over the blanket. Its very odd. We have not noticed this in past washes and we always wash it the same way.Picture little round pieces of fiber ALL over the floor and blanket. Didn't hold up very well since its only been a couple of months.
3,"Good product, just not what I wanted","I ordered this to add extra warmth under my comforter. It certainly did that, this blanket will keep you warm! But I have a full size bed and when the description says ""full/queen"" you should read it as meaning ""queen size"" because this was easily about 16"" too wide for my full size bed.Also, if you are wanting a fleece or microfiber type material, you may be disappointed. The Vellux is very different. I returned this and bought a really nice full size microfiber blanket from walmart for less than what this cost. I am very pleased with it, and the microfiber is lighter weight than this Vellux."
2,Not happy,"The only thing stopping me from returning this blanket is that my mother needs a spare blanket at her house and volunteered to take it off my hands..I was expecting something a tiny bit lighter and a little softer. Does not seem like it is going to hold up either though I hope I am wrong. The color was also not what I was expecting..the yellow just is not pleasing to my eye..seems drab.If you need a blanket for dirt cheap then this is your product. Otherwise, spend a little extra and get one of those microplush blankets they have on sale now."
2,No luxury here,"Like Robin, I thought the blanket sounded great, and most of the reviews were very positive. But I'm not sure what they're thinking cause this thing is hardly soft and cuddly. Not the cheapest blanket I've ever seen, but it does bear some resemblance to packing foam. And my ""white"" blanket is actually a yellowish-cream. DEFINITELY sending it back, and I won't be buying Martex again."
5,So Soft!,We have used only these blankets for years and have not found a softer blanket in the same price range yet.
4,Great blanket!,This blanket is very warm and is the only extra blanket I have used this winter. The only problem I have with it is that it's sort of stiff due to the middle insulating layer.
4,Super soft,Bought this for one of my guest rooms. Had family over during the holidays and they commented how cozy the blanket was. great value. Glad I bought two !!
3,Martex Vellux Blanket,"this blanket isn't as thick and luxurious as it appears in the photo.though it is toasty warm, the right color, and does have a fuzzy quality, for the most part it's an overly generous sized miscut layer of velux foam.however; it is warm and toasty layered between the sheet and bedspread, so if you aren't looking for good visual quality this one works."
3,Wrong Color Shipped,"This is nice blanket, unfortunatly I had to return it because instead of receiving the blanket in lavendar for my daughter's room, I was shipped a grey blanket."
3,Warm but stiff,"There are several manufacturers of Vellux blankets. This one is soft and warm, but it ia not pliable, so it's not easy to fold down or wrap around your body. When folded, it pops up and does not hold a fold/crease. It is very warm and soft, so I rated it 3 stars, but it is basically a large piece of soft fuzzy plastic which does not shed or pill."
3,Beware of tiny lint particles,"Packaging is nice when it first arrived. The maroon color is gorgeous and the ivory color is okay. I washed them right away because they smelled funny. As soon as I washed them, I noticed tiny particles of lint all over my washer and dryer. After drying the maroon one, I then noticed more lint particles on the sheets that I had laid them on. Although, the product is very light wieght and somewhat soft, I wish I hadn't purchased this product. You can probably find better ones elsewhere for the same price. I just stuffed them in duvets for now and am using them that way. I hate returning stuff so I'll just keep them. P.S. Still smell funny after washing. But will still give stars for the color of the maroon, lightweight and okay priced."
2,Blankets,"I bought these blankets and they just haven't held up well at all. I use them on my couch and when the dogs jump up and down from the couch, the blankets tore really easily. I have some vellux blankets on my bed and they seem to be more sturdy.I'm sure most people wouldn't have any problems with this product but if you have pets, they don't hold up well at all."
1,Poor quality!,"I've never written an Amazon review before, also I didn't read the reviews either when I bought this blanket, otherwise, I woudn't buy it, that's for sure! All the negative reviews that were written about this blanket are really true, and I don't understand Howcome some of the reviews are positive ! This blanket is extremly poor quality, very thin, you almost can see trough it. I found it difficult to keep lying flat on bed when I tryed to make it, didn't stay straight, not even after putting the bedspread over it. It looks more like a thin foam sponge, and it has, also, a bad smell.I just returned it, Amazon was Amazong - just kidding, I mean Amazing, course - and accepted it back."
2,Don't believe the colors,"Received our new blanket today and very disappointed with the color. Ordered ""lavender"" and blanket was labeled lavender but it is closer to the grey of weathered wood. Quality seems to be OK but not near what our 15 year old blanket is. It will not be long before we purchase another one where we can be sure of the color."
5,Vellux Blanket,"My ""old"" Vellux blanket (probably 15 years old was WORN OUT) This replacement was just what I wanted! I would like for manufacturers to make bedding for Queen-sized beds SPECIFICALLY instead of for Queen OR Full. Wish it were a bit longer, but then, I wish ALL Queen-sized blankets were a bit longer."
5,Vellux Blanket,Really keeps you warm at night. Very light weight but does a great job keeping you warm. Gives you a good nights sleep.
3,dirty blanket,"When I received this blanket and took it out of the plastic container it was quite dirty along the folds. It did not look as though it was used but rather that it probably had been sitting on a warehouse or store shelf for years.These Vellux blankets are now hard to find so I did not send it back. Since it did look new, except for the dirt, I just washed it and it is now fine. I think it should have been sold as used and at a reduced price.It did arrive very quickly which I like."
2,&#x025B6; &#x025B6; &#x025B6; &#x025B6; &#x025B6; WARNING! LAVENDER IS DRAMATICALLY _NOT_ AS DEPICTED ON AMAZON,"OMG! I only wish I could share a photo with you to show you how _dramatically NOT_ LAVENDER these blankets are!Folks, order the LAVENDER and be prepared to get . . . GREY. I was so astonished when I opened the bag I actually had to take it out in the sun to make sure my eyes weren't deceiving me. Now when I say it is GREY, honey, I mean GREY and nothing but GREY. The sheer audacity of promoting this color graphic on the Amazon site when it is as bare-faced a misrepresentation of this color is beyond me.And lest anyone doubt that my eyes are playing tricks, this blanket is so ""washed out"" looking that a friend of mine remarked 'I thought you said you were getting it in LAVENDER to match the drapes? Why did you get this PUKE GREY color, did they make a mistake?""You've been warned! The blanket is fine, except that I want to puke every time I look at it."
2,Color was faded in folds of blanket,"I really wanted a vellux blanket for my son because it's a great blanket for allergy sufferers. It can withstand being washed in hot water and hold up well. When I received this blanket it seemed like it had been in storage for a long time. The color of the China blue blanket was faded along the folds. That was very disappointing. I still really like vellux blankets, but this one I'm sure was old, and not in perfect condition."
2,ok blanket,I bought this because there are so many good reviews about it. When I recieved it I was disapointed. It wasn't as soft or as warm as I had expected it to be. I used it for one night and was cold all night long. I will have to try it again when winter is over. But for now I would not recomend buying this if you are expecting a really soft and warm blanket.
1,Not as advertised,Ordered 90% cotton and 10% polyester Martex VelluxReceived 100% NYLON Vellux Westpoint Home.WE were supplied a much cheaper product!
1,Don't waste your money or time !!!!!!!,This blanket is the poorest excuse for a vellux blanket! It is stiff and extremely thin. This so called blanket also sheds. Do not waste your money on shipping just so you can turn around and send it back. I wish I would have carefully studied other reviews submitted before I wasted my time.
2,Quality is Missing,"I love Martex Velllux Blankets. You could say I am addicted to them -- I have them in more than a handful of colors. But this recent purchase was way below par. The thickness of the pile is 1/2 that of my other vellux blankets, it has a weird feel -- almost sticky feel. This is not the same quality that I am used to from Martex Vellux blankets. Very disappointed -- but too much of a hassle to return it :(."
3,blanket,I love the color of the blanket it is perfect for my decor. Unfortunately there is a light brown stain along what appears to be where the blanket was folded. I have washed it twice and the stain has not come off.
1,Marteux Vellux King Blanket,"This blanket was a vellux, king size blanket in the china blue color I requested. However, the blanket is thin and after several washings, the dark stains (which looks like the product had been on the shelf too long in sunlight or it was seconds)did not come out.Extremely disappointed and will not buy anything from the site again. I was able to purchase the same product at a local department store 50% cheaper than from Amazon. I overpaid."
2,Not what described,This item is not nearly as soft as some I'd seen in the store. It is also a yellowish white. Definately not a white which is what I was looking for.
3,Definitely not like real velour,"I ordered this to save money. I needed to replace a real velour blanket that was lost in a move, but this vellux isn't nearly as nice. It's rather a stiff blanket and though it's pretty warm, the difference in quality is apparent. I don't really regret having bought it, but wish I'd put that money toward real velour instead."
3,Meh,"This blanket's alright, but it didn't blow my mind. I was hoping for something much softer, more like a fleece blanket I guess, but the vellux fabric on this is actually sort of rough even after a wash. It does look nice, and the blanket is nice and warm."
4,Vellux Blanket,Always liked Vellux blankets but they're harder to find. Generous size. Washed well. Light weight for summer but warm in the winter.
2,I'm not in love,"I ordered this to put on my bed after getting a Standard Poodle puppy (that claimed the bed as his). I wanted something soft, warm and that would protect the nicer bedding underneath it.Meh.This blanket is stiff and scratchy. It wasn't a fan at all. It's not in his crate. He loves it.So, great dog blanket. Not so good for humans."
1,Not satisfied......,"I'm extremely dissatisfied with the quality of this blanket. I washed the blanket once in cold water and dried it on ""normal"" setting in the dryer. When I immediately took it out of the dryer, I noticed random holes and ""chunks"" removed all over it. I don't feel it should have created holes, especially since I've owned these types of vellux blankets for many years now, like those from the Martha Stewart collection. I would not recommend this blanket based upon its poor quality."
5,Love these blankets!,"I have bought 2 of these for my daughters and they love them, they are very warm."
4,"It does what it's supposed to do, it's a blanket","It's a blanket. It's supposed to be warm, comfy and cover the bad. That's what it does. I bought the twin size for my daughter a year ago and it's held up well with washings. I don't like to write reviews too soon after I get a product."
3,Poorly sewn,"After only one washing, the hem began unraveling and I will have to sew it back in. I preferred blue bell color, but ordered china blue because blue bell was unavailable in King size - but they actually shipped the blue bell (in King) by happy mistake! Other than the hem unraveling, I am happy with the blanket. It will not be too much trouble to fix it - but if you are looking for quality sewing you may be disappointed."
2,Yellow Martex Vellux Blanket,"One side of this blanket is sticky, and I have been unable to get rid of the stickiness - even after washing it 4 or 5 times, with and without fabric softener. I purchased a queen size blanket just like it a year ago and did not have this problem."
3,"Nice Blanket, however......","After washing it a few times, I'm very pleased with this blanket. It's light weight but warm, and looks very luxurious. However, bring this blanket to the laundromat to wash it...It made a complete mess of my new front load washer and dryer......Fibers all over the place....Even after two washes, the dust on my bedroom furniture still has blanket fibers in it.....The blanket needs to be washed a few times from the manufacturer.....Just for the mess I had to clean up, I would not purchase this again....It wasn't worth the trouble !"
2,Hemmed on only 2 sides.,"I just couldn't believe that this blanket is hemmed on only 2 sides. The other 2 sides are completely unfinished. It looks like they just have a giant roll and hack off some to make your blanket. Looks OK otherwise, works OK. I wouldn't buy another."
5,wow do I love this warm blanket!,"The blanket is light-weight, yet they are surprisingly dense. I have purchased velour type blankets before, and found them wanting as far as warmth, and did not last long. The weave is much denser, and it makes them so good at keeping you warm, but not overheated. You feel like Goldielocks...just right.These are twice the quality you will find in stores and surprisingly less than I paid for the last ones. The material is strong, showing they will wear well. I don't think you can beat the price for there. I sit at the computer and write for hours, and they are perfect for a throw on a sofa. I bought two and loved them so much, I am ordering more. Very highly recommended. Shipping was quick, too! Worth every penny."
5,great purchase,this was exactly what i was looking for. perfect! these seem to be hard to find now that most stores are closing up and going out of business. this was a great deal. go for it!
5,Vellux Blanket,I love these blankets. They keep my kids warm and keep the allergies away. The shipping was fast. I will definitely purchase in the future.
2,Sheds,"I loved my first velour blanket bought a while back, not sure which brand, made in the USA, soft, hypoallergenic. This one is OK but not as soft. It had a funny smell out of the bag. So I washed in cold water before use, & it shed a lot in the washer & dryer. I didn't return due to having washed it. It still sheds some. Label says made in China, hmmmmm, much poorer quality than that first one I bought a while back. Sorry, don't usually have anything against Chinese made goods."
5,"Soft, warm, long-lasting","I've tried expensive wool blankets, as well as other kinds of synthetics, and nothing matches the long-lasting softness, lightweight, and warmth of Vellux--year after year after year.My previous Vellux blanket lasted almost 20 years before it started to dissolve.And, amazingly, Vellux blankets only get softer over time.They're also warm--yet very lightweight. In summer they're fine by themselves, in winter you can use them as a thermal blanket combined with other layers.They never pill or get hard.You can wash them in hot water to sterilize them--though you must dry them on a cooler setting--too much dryer heat can cook them--and they dry very quickly even on a low warm setting.You also must wash them at least twice a year--this keeps it from getting brittle and makes it softer--you don't need fabric softener.The chocolate brown color is beautiful, and I look forward to many years of warm sleep under it!"
4,Quality Holds Up,"I purchased 5 of these last year as gifts and they are still holding up after many washings and dryer use. They continue to be soft and retain many of the qualities of a new item. I did notice some fraying on one of the blankets, but it does not run and fray larger than the one spot. The fray could have been from my son and his use of toys on the bed, and not the fault of the blanket. Wonderful product!"
5,Love the Vellux Blanket !,We needed a King size blanket for our bed in Florida and this is perfect! It's soft and lightweight so its good for year round use!
5,Great Blanket,I love this blanket! It is warm and beautiful. I use it as a bedspread during the day because it is such a beautiful and rich cranberry red.
5,Light weight yet wonderfully warm and cozy!,"I have two of these wonderful blankets on my bed. The are light enough that covering up under two of them makes you roasty-toasty on the coldest of nights. Just one is great for most evenings as these blankets have excellent thermal warmth.One tip, these blankets loved to washed in the machine every month or two and you should have years of enjoyment out of them."
3,Love a new blanket,"I love putting a new blanket on the bed. This is a nice one, especially for the money. My only concern is I had a Vellux once that didn't hold up to normal wear and tear. We'll see. At this time, I'm really happy with my purchase."
3,Just OK,"This blanket is nice, but it is still kinda stiff after many washings, and still has an artificial type smell that is hard to describe. Good value, but I will not purchase again."
4,Very good blanket,"I got the cranberry and it's very soft and keeps us warm, so it's fully functional. The only problem is the color. I'm using a Viewsonic monitor and everything generally looks right on it, but this blanket did not. It looked like a true red, a cherry red, in fact. The blanket is more like a wine/burgundy red. I'm not going to return it or rant about it because it's a bit late for that now. I just wanted to make anyone interested in the cranberry aware that the color may not seem right in the picture. I don't know what camera took that picture, but I'm willing to bet that's the problem."
2,Don't trust the colors!,"I just ordered two of these in lavender for my girls beds, and what I received is definitely nothing like the lavender pictured online. This is an exact match to the grey that is shown; however the bag is tagged as 'lavender'. I think whoever packed this is color blind! I have ordered these blankets in the past from Amazon (in a dark blue) and I really love them - soft, warm and so light. But, these two are going straight back because the color is really awful! There's not a hint of purple, lilac, lavender in them."
1,Martex Vellux Blanket,"It looked okay when I opened it. Then I washed it before using and my washer and dryer were full of ""cranberry"" colored lint (wet in the washer and dry in the dryer). The next time I washed it was better but, still some lint in the washer and normal in the dryer. It is not warm enough alone. It might be okay in the warmer months but, not what I expected for winter."
2,Very thin blankets,These blankets are so much thinner than the ones I used to buy from Pennys. They really are not worth the money. The quality on Vellux blankets has declined and I would love to find really good ones in a Twin Extra Long like I used to buy for my Dad.
4,"This is NOT white, it is off white","Nice blanket, I sent it back, it is not SNOW white, it is off-white, ivory, whatever you would like to call it, but it is not white."
3,Disappointed In Color,I ordered the white...when it arrived it was definitely not white. The color is a true cream. I checked the packaging to make sure I was sent the white blanket; and I was. Very disappointing.
1,"""White"" Color Is Not White; Blanket is Extremely Thin","What the manufacturer is calling ""White"" is actually a dirty light yellow color. The blanket is so very thin that I can see my hand right through it. I am extremely disappointed."
3,Martex Vellux Blanket,The blanket was exactly what I wanted.......the only complaint I have is ..I cant get the fold lines out of it........it must have been in the package for years and has permanent creases in it
5,Warm it up Chris!!!,"Great blanket and a great price! Cozy in the winter, YO!I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone, looks and feels just like velvet----yummy!Peace!"
3,Okay for lightweight blanket,"Bought this for our daughter a little over a year ago and have used it when visiting her. It's quite lightweight and reasonably warm for the weight. Quality is in the medium range -- not bad, but not great either."
1,Not White,"I purchased the ""white"" blanket and it is a definite yellow...not even a pale yellow. Do not buy this if you want a nice WHITE blanket. The fabric feels a little cheap as well. Thin and polyester feeling."
1,Diappointed in the color,The blanket is a nice blanket and the price is good but i wanted white and it was definitely NOT white. If i had wanted another color...i probably would have been very happy
1,Not White,"I ordered this blanket because I wanted a white vellux blanket and have had problems finding a white one, so I jumped on the chance to purchase this one. Well, I received it and it looked yellow, so I returned it. Got a replacement thinking that it was just labeled wrong. My replacement that came yesterday was the same pale yellow. These are great blankets if you want something other than white, but if you're looking for a white blanket, you'll be out of luck."
4,vitamedic vitamins,"I have been taking these vitamins for 5 years. I stopped once, and really felt like I could tell a difference. Why not take them, we all need to take vitamins to supplement our diet, and I feel these are a great choice."
1,Unpleasant fragrance,"Love some of this company's fragrances, i.e., Inis Energy of the Sea, so thought I'd branch out and try others by them. Saw a favorable review, so chose to try this one. AWFUL! Definitely won't order this again!!!"
4,Very Pretty Smell,"This was as pretty a smell as I remembered. Saw it in a shop on the Bunratty Castle estate in Ireland.I didn't buy it then and regretted it, so happy I found it online."
5,"Nature and alluring, seductive freshness.","My wife, and I, discovered this wonderful, unique and evocative scent while on our third cycling trip around the Emerald Isle, this most recent one to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. This bouquet of so many well blended natural fragrances, some recognizable and others softly mysterious, captivated us instantly. A perfume my wife enrobes herself in on a very regular basis. A touch of the Isle with us here in Canada. . . .We will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree . . ."
5,This is a wonderful cd by far.,I am glad that you had it . I enjoyed listening to it.signed David Haskins
1,Never got the thing?,"I had the opportunity to hear this at a party in the Oaks. And was very taken by the selections and arrangements. Unfortunately I never received my order the seller after numerous contacts finally told me they wereout of stock. Really disappointed with the communications should have used amazonfor my seller, never had a problem there. Sorry nothing good to say on this one.Except go amazon for most of your CD buying needs."
5,"THE SECOND PART OF EXCELLENCE, IN LUTHER'S HONOR !!!.","THIS album is just as amazing as volume one, the excellence continues !!!.HERE, we are treated to classic LUTHER by some of the best JAZZ ARTISTS of today, for example...""GIVE ME THE REASON"" by KIRK WHALUM, ""TILL MY BABY COMES HOME"" featuring NORMAN BROWN with EVERETTE HARP, ""THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN LOVE"" with MAYSA and KEVIN WHALUM, ""FOR YOU TO LOVE"" by JEFF LORBER, ""IF THIS WORLD WERE MINE"" featuring GERALD ALBRIGHT, ""THE GLOW OF LOVE"" by WAYMAN TISDALE, ""SO AMAZING"" by PATTI AUSTIN, ""THE NIGHT I FELL IN LOVE"" featuring NAJEE, ""I DON'T WANT TO BE A FOOL"" by JHONATHAN BUTLER and ""SUPERSTAR"" featuring WILL DOWNING. AGAIN, all are well crafted efforts to LUTHER'S legacy !!!. TO all JAZZ fans, you will be giving yourself a treat to pick this one up !!!. IT'S very soothing...pleasure awaits..."
5,It suits its purpose,"I was attracted to this album for one song: So Amazing by Patti Austin. The rest of the album was a bonus to me. I listen to it in the car, while I'm exercising outdoors, and generally anywhere I want audio wallpaper--it stays in the background allowing me to concentrate on other tasks at hand without being a distraction."
5,Civilization IV,"This is a fantastic game, better than I could ever imagine. Great graphics, great theme, numerous variations to choose from. Never had such a great game. Better than the original version which I had and lost. I am glad I lost the first one, now I have a better one. Thanks."
4,Good addition to the Civ series,I've been playing this game for about a month now. If you like the previous Civilization games then you'll have a lot of fun with this one too. Just beware the addictive nature of these games. Once you get going it is very hard to quit.
2,Civ 4: Civ 3 but more boring and slow,"I'm glad I waited to buy this one used because it's certainly not worth the original asking price.First off, if you've played Civ 3, you've already seen everything fun about Civ 4. If you got bored of Civ 3 and stopped playing, you will find yourself bored during your first game.Secondly, it just feels incredibly slow and boring. Cities take thousands of years to grow to a decent size, the AI makes no sense, the maps and interface are clunky, etc.Thirdly, and this is a pet peave of mine- the music is terrible. It's just amazingly terrible. It actually sounds like there are wrong notes all over the place, and they just layer different musics with no regard to pitch or tonality.This will be the last Civ I buy unless they completely rework it. Not at all worth the upgrade."
3,Still can't top Civ II,"Sure, in terms of graphical sophistication and rules, this latest Civ is the most impressive yet. But in terms of sheer escapist fantasy power, it doesn't hold a candle to Civ II.The problem with making things gorgeous to look at, especially at high resolution and in detail, is that the game slows down considerably. By the time you have invested 8 hours playing a round, and your little empire has grown, you want the game to proceed a snappy pace. Rendering all that detail, however, has a cost, even on a higher-end home system. Civ IV's big weakness is that game play becomes very slow.Others certainly disagree and prefer the eye candy of animated rivers and watching individual units flex their muscles in combat. I've turned off all the detail and as much animation as I can get away with, but the game still isn't as much fun as Civ II, which I still play. Your mileage might vary, so give it a shot--the 'gold' edition is certainly a good deal."
3,Error ridden for Vista,"I have attempted to update the game but I get an error when I try that. I have uninstalled the game, reinstalled it several times. I have made sure that direct x and other things are completely updated before reinstalling. I have followed all instructions that the company has given me to fix the issue..(to include removing the game from the registry) and STILL I get the same error. I can not install ANY patches because it says that there is NO previously installed version of the game. No patches. They keep telling me to install patches in a particular order...NO PATCHES WILL INSTALL... I can not update the game or upgrade to the next version. Overall this game is good but I am not happy about the Vista incompatibility."
4,Civ 4 gold,"I personaly own this game and I am proud of it. Like all the civilization games before it, this is just the latest and greatest version out. I recomend trying the demo before buying. But I like editing the xml files for bigger cities and more gold. The mod options are great. And the in game map editor is a handy addion compared to previous games. I got this a christmas gift in 07. It is worth 4 stars if you a fan of these games."
3,They always change the wrong stuff,"Instead of spending all their time and energy on improving the graphics, which was NOT really needed, so far as I'm concerned, I wish the designers would concentrate on improving the GAME, especially the movement and combat systems, which are pathetic. Even 40-year-old board games had better systems, and they didn't have the advantage of a computer to figure out all the ramifications of terrain, numbers, etc. Why can't we have combat where whole stacks attack whole stacks? Why can't we have lines of supply for units in the field? Why can't we have a limit on how many units can be stacked in one square? Why can't they use a grid of hexagons instead of squares? Come on, guys! If I want fancy graphics I'll get a movie DVD; give us a GAME!While they're at it, I'd also like to be able to choose the color for my units.So far, after a few games, I don't think Civ IV is any more fun than Civ III; and isn't fun what's its all about?"
3,civilization IV gold,"definitely a strategy game...not a whole lot of action,but then again i'm into fps's. But i get laided off in the winter and i'm hoping this could be a nice little fill in for time...think it might work."
1,"A great game, but beware of a problem with the GOLD edition","This is one of the greatest games of all time. But beware of a problem with the gold edition. Inside the box is a highly abridged manual that says on the cover 'complete manual on disc 3'. Well, no there isn't. I called the publishers support line and was told there were no manuals on the cd's and I should google it. The only thing I found was some pirate sites. Great. The publisher of this game is sending me to pirate sites for the documentation that should have come with the game. This is NOT a game you can understand and play without a thorough manual. Good luck with that."
1,Civilization Player for YEARS!,"I have been playing Sid's Civilization since day one ... I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every new release. However, Civilization IV is, plain and simple, lame! I hate it. The interface looks like a little kid game and it just feels terrible. The tech tree is far too over-cluttered now. As soon as I developed a religion and saw the separate temples for each religion, I exited and uninstalled it. Too much can sometimes be a bad thing ... Civ4 has WAY too much going on now ... they should have just fixed Civ3 ... it's a shame ... a dedicated Civ Fan just walked away!"
3,"good, for a time","loved civ 2, so I got this one. Hadn't played any civ games since civ 2.This one is cool, but more complex. However, I got board of it too quick."
1,A Giant Step Down,"I was extremely disappointed in Civ IV compared to Civ II and III. Civ IV plays extremely differently than its previous versions. Did Sid have a conversion experience because Civ IV seems to be all about religion? I bought my computer a year ago and it wasn't a bare-bones model but the videos are choppy and the graphics are awful. So unless you have spent thousands of dollars on a sports car of computers, don't waste your money on this one."
2,AWFUL,"i loved playing civilization when i was a kid but omg all this time has passed and instead of using the technology they really moved back in time. the scenario in this game is so awfull that there is no way you can enjoy it. There are not a lot of improvements and the game is very stupid! definatly not worth the money. go buy age of empires, at least they have improved their games alittle"
1,Sid Meir's Civilization IV,"Don't like the graphics or movement of the various people, animals, etc. The tutorial is not the best. After numerous tries to understand the game I un-installed it and put it on the shelf."
4,A worthy upgrade,"I'm very pleased by Civilization 4.This is much more than just a look and feel update, they have tweaked the rules in way which makes it more realistic and with a bigger depth of detail. Spying, religion, governments are much more interesting.The game feels faster as well.I want to mention that Beyond the sword is also a worthy addition.This last version might as well confuse veteran players. The cost of cities tends to sky rocket with their number and building as many cities as you can at the start is not the best option. On the other hand the corruption just affect cities cost now, so your remote city can still produce, which is cool."
5,excellent,"This is a superb visual and stunning achievement in gaming, with amazing flexibility of use! It's mods are myriad and removable, able to do just about anything. The units are more balanced and powerful than CIV III, and the governments seem to work better. I took me back to the enjoyable simplicity of the first CIV's, with available complexity that does not intrude, like specializations for units you can use or ignore. Very intuitive, even for a part-time gamer like myself. Highly recommended, Sid is back!"
5,"Great game, wish I'd bought the Complete Edition","I got to this game a few years after it came out, but I am not at all dissapointed in the content. The only thing I wish is that I'd have bought the complete edition (which I didn't know existed), instead of buying this edition and Beyond the Sword separately."
2,Booooring,"I've played all incarnations of the Civ game and I really have to say that they never change. They never improve. They never evolve. This game might have been fun 10 years ago, but now its just a boring, nonsensical waste of time and money. So disappointing. Civ 2 was a better, funner game by far."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","Used this book for a .Net course I teach. Topics presented in book were appropriate for a beginners class. The business focus of the book was a primary reason for choosing this particular book. So far so good.Unfortunately, many chapter end examples had errors. One in particular had code jumbled and out of order. Supplied exercise files were incorrect, it was in fact the same file for several chapters.Checking the errata section of the website was fruitless. Apparently the book had no errors...Anyway, I am switching our text next semester - probably to Deitel."
3,A nice selection of Kitchen Tools,"I gave this item a 3 star even thought I'm happy with what I got. There's a nice selection of tools for the kitchen in here and the only thing I'm not happy with is that after using one of the fish slice tools, I noticed that it got burned after cooking with a normal heat in a pan. I would've thought that they would've used a better plastic that could take more heat before it got damaged."
3,"Ok, but .......","This set is ok, the grater works well and I use the measuring utensils daily.. However the flat spatula broke.. I mean the handle snapped right off while flipping a 5oz steak(as you know these are rather small steaks). So watch the handles on the spoons so far they are ok, but I am going to watch it now seems these pieces are very cheaply made.So far the rest of the items work as expected."
5,Visual Homage,"This visual look at the energetic scholar of literature and religion captures his infectious high spirits nicely. Campbell has fun with his material, which is--contrary to the critcism of Diogenes-the-reviewer--of real substance and depth. It's not the easy syncretism of rebellious adolescent dabblers in Eastern religion: it's mature, creative thinking by a deeply read scholar, and if you're just goofing off with ""spirituality,"" like much of today's pop New Age devotees, you feel quickly out of your depth with this stuff. Any writer or tradition he raises for discussion, he is steeped in. Show me shallowness, Diogenes, in his discussions of Joyce or Schopenhauer, Buddhism or Christianity. Having a vast range to one's education, doesn't automatically mean one's understanding is spread thin. Let this look at a great mind and spirit inspire you, prospective Campbellians,to serious look at his work."
4,Be your own Hero,"A dated but really sweet presentation by Joseph Campbell about the Hero's Journey myth in which he explains the departure, initiation, and return home of the Hero!"
2,Not what I had expected,"I am a huge fan of Campbell. That being said, I was a bit disappointed by this DVD. First, I thought it would be an in depth discussion of ""The Hero's Journey"". which is a truly important concept in my view. When I determined that it was more biographical (I should have paid more attention to the description), I settled in for learning more about the man. Although there were some interesting biographical scenes, the movie lacked focus as it bounced around between early years, an award ceremony, and lectures/seminars with student groups. I would have been happy with an in depth biographical study, or a concentration on the ideas in the seminars. A much better DVD is Finding Joe, an exquisite analysis of his ideas."
4,The Storyteller,"This was a nice little production - the best part is seeing Campbell in action, telling his stories and captivating the students. He really seemed to live what he preached."
5,Hero's Journey...,"Interesting information presented by Campbell. Learned about the Hero's Journey in a college script writing course. Fascinating to actually see and hear Campbell as he presents his theories, opening one's mind to a different perspective on life."
2,not worth the hype,"I really like experimental films, however Kenneth Anger's films did little for me. I really liked ""Invocation of my Demon Brother"", it's the film I heard most about and it was well made. The problem is that you have to listen to the commentary at the same time you watch the films, to gain any understanding. I found Anger's voice boring and I found myself fast forwarding the disk, looking for something exciting to focus on. The movies are just too symbolic for its own good. I've read so much about Anger over the years that I find it pathetic that for someone who practices magick, he can't perform an effective protection spell to avoid getting mugged in New York five times as he has said. He also has tax problems. Prosperity spells? I think there is more hype than reality in Anger's history, however I still find him an interesting individual. Just not his films."
1,"Frye's 2,500 Nursing Bullets","I have been studying for the NCLEX for 3 weeks now. I have utilized several books and all of them state that the NCLEX is a standardized exam that does not test you at the ""recall"" level. You are tested on your ability to critically think and memorizing facts (2,500 of them) is not going to be helpful to me. I purchased this book and am now regretting the fact that I did. There is no way for me to memorize this much data. I have to be able to apply what I learned from a body of knowledge I spent many dollars & years investing in. Cramming for a test by memorization does not work on a standardized exam."
3,Mr. Heater,"Purchased the heater and after using it for the first time camping over New Years, I am dissappointed. First, I did not realize you have to use a lighter to start it. Unlike previous propane heater we had, you turn on the propane and hold the switch until it ignites fully and heats up and it stays on. Found that it appears it you have a ""slight"" wind, (ever so slight) the burner goes out. Not happy with the product, but there aren't many choices out there. Spent a lot of many for something that is just so - so. Very disappointed."
2,Costy,It's is good but it use way to much gas than other heaters I've had before. It cost like 11$/ hour runing.
2,Not worth the money.,The middle daisy never did work from day one. Aftera couple of weeks the second daisy failed to work. The protector cage 4fell off after tranporting it one time. For the money it was not worth it. The single daisy fixtue actually had more positive aspects. Easy to use and it worked well. I needed this for the people at work. It appeared to work satisfactoly at furst but the middle daisy never would light up. And now the the second daisy does not function either. There are no adjustment to make. So nopw I have purchased a thtee daisy haeaater and only one works. would not recomment to purchase.
3,Heater,The third time I used the heater one of the burners quit working. Trouble shooting guide says it is probably a defective thermo couple. Sounds like this is a reoccurring problem.
5,Works Well,"I bought this to heat garage when I'm working on motorcycles, I'm glad I did it heats very well. Burns a 20lb tank in 10hrs on high. I would say if you own the garage invest in some insulation and a quality built in heater, but if you rent like me this works good enough."
4,Mr Heater,"Works great. Amazon was by fare the cheapest price i found for this. This MR Heater really puts out the heat. Lighting it was hard at times. I would use a grill lighter, that works a lot better. Even with the lighter holes in extreme cold it's sometimes not easy to light. If you can get a flame right on the burner it lights easy every time. I also thought if you had one or two burners going, you didn't need a lighter to light another burner. This is not the case, i had to use the lighter. I let the gas run for a bit but it wouldn't light up. I still remain happy with this buy."
5,Woah!!,This one blew me away instantly. Top-notch performances by two masters. The sound quality is so good you'd swear these two guys were sitting in your living room. This is my third CD featuring Cyril. Now it's time to catch up on Brozman.
2,Lifeless history,"The author must be given a lot of credit for doing the research and bringing to light this negelected subject. This is the only book ever published that deals with the early days of the Mafia in Philly. Therefore it is essential reading for any serious students of the subject. However, the author's style of writing is bland and lifeless. She manages to transform a tremendously interesting subject into a dull and almost sterile story. Hopefully books number 2 and 3 are more exciting."
4,That'sa good a book.,"The 1st couple chapters made me feel like I was doing a thesis for a masters and is more for sociologits. The main part of the book was really good reading if you are into the history of Philly , the Philly mob or ethnic groups in Philly. I read it for mainly the mafia history. It is obvious she did a lot of work on the background. I just wish it was a little longer for the amount of money you pay. Looking forward to the next volume."
4,The writing doesn't measure up to the research,"As a crime historian, I treasure author Celeste Morello's two volumes on the early Philadelphia mob. As a reader, however, I was a bit disappointed. Morello appears to be a far better historian/researcher than she is a writer. She apparently had difficulty weaving an overabundance of facts into a coherent story. Accounts of underworld incidents often interrupt other accounts or character descriptions.While those aspects of the books diminish the reading experience somewhat, they barely put a dent in the author's overall achievement. Morello seems to have a rare understanding of the Sicilian psyche and illustrates the importance of old-country rivalries in making sense of underworld conflicts.Due to her willingness to tap into records neglected by other researchers, to her critical eye, and to her grasp of Sicilian tradition, the two volumes of Before Bruno contain a wealth of information that won't be found elsewhere."
2,Not Recieved Item: 1996 Centennial Games on VHS,"I Have not recieved this item ""NBC Sports Presents Americas Games The Greatest Moments of the 1996 Centennial Games on VHS"".. This is a long time past Promised shipping of this product.I am wondering....is it coming?"
2,Works well for a short time,Used it on large boards thinking it would work however it dulled and the sharpness faded. Only works on thinner wood boards and for a short amount of time. After that it dulls.. Hard to stabilize when cutting large boards and small boards because you have to make a jig. Be careful when using.
4,Useful bits,Fast shipping. I've used the bits to cut small channels so far. They work well as long you only try to cut a small depth. I found that for harder woods about 1/16 inch at time works well.
4,Little but big in ability,These products where a little smaller than I had hoped but they work great. Sharp little SOBs which is the best part.
4,Get's the job done,Hey these are great router bits for small projects.If you're looking to do some major work then you'll need a real router.However if you're doing small jobs this is easier and cleaner than a big router.good quality steel. Good assortment of bit designs.They are very reasonably priced to just have it in case you need it.
4,"Good bits, fast shipping, easy to set-up and use","No real complaints about this set. I'm very amateur at wood working and everything was easy to use. Mostly used the rounded tip for routing letters in red oak. Experienced some burning which is probably user error.Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that the router bits are TINY...I know it's a Dremel bit set, but they are TINY."
4,Good job Dremel,"These bits have worked out very well. I've put them through a tough test too. I was working with some 1/4"" and 3/8 "" ply wood. I was amazed how well they worked. Anybody who has used a power tool will tell you that hard woods and plywood are tough on blades and bits. Thumbs up Dremel"
4,Love the router bits - would like expanded selection,"I love these router bits. Combined with my use of the Dremel router/shaper table, these bits make precise and consistent cuts. I use these for a very specific project, and I'm fortunate that a couple of the bits in the set are just the size I need. However, I'd like to see more bit types and sizes for added routing flexibility."
5,Dremel bit set,"quick and convienent way to purchase from home, got the goods in a few days and they where in excellent shape"
2,Don't quite measure up to advertising.,"They say that they are easy to use, but you have to cut in levels to get the depth you need which tends to lead to inaccurate cutting. This is mostly a result of the Dremel tool itself. I burnt out my original tool trying the router blades and had to buy a new one.I have no issue with the company shipping the product. They represented themselves prefectly."
2,Have a purpose,I guess they should have a purpose. I just haven't found out what it is. Not really worth the money. They can't do much.
3,Can get the job done if you are patient.,Not bad. As most reviews have said the Dremel is a high speed-low torque tool. I found I was still able to what I wanted by making multiple passes and increasing the depth with each pass. It took a little more time but it works and is cheaper than dishing out the money for a proper router. I would recommend against using this on anything harder than pine as you will be more likely to burn out the motor on harder woods.
3,Good idea for small projects only,"Love my dremel and wanted to use these until I could afford a real router. However, after about one use on a bigger board, one of the bits is dull. So if you need these for really small projects you'll be fine. If you need to do anything over 1/4th of an inch, don't plan on using them more than once."
4,"Good little pump, bad little gauge","Pump worked great on my 60 psi tires. The only problem was the gauge was DOA. Not sure if they're all like that, but seeing as I considered the gauge a bonus to begin with, I didn't bother requesting a replacement."
5,Battle Alert -A Must see,"Excellent coverage about how the US Navy Battlegroup works. It also goes into the blockade of Iraq in exquisite detail, and the ways in which the armed forces train for battle."
4,A Treasure,I am currently teaching an adult how to read and this book breaks down the rules of English. Once the adult grasps the rudiments of each letter and sounds then it opens a different world to the individual. This book frames each fundamental area that as a teacher you can quickly assess where the problem area is for the individual and teaches you how to teach someone to read.
3,Minor problems but not fatal,"It works fine as intended. But I can see there are rough spots. One weakness is in its lock/key. The key sometimes is stuck in its position and can not be pulled out from the key slot, when the unit is powered on. The hard drive caddy, when inserted into the docking case, often bump into some metal/plastic parts and can not be smoothly slided into the case."
3,SATA Mobile Rack by Vantec,"I own several of these Vantec EZ Swap 2 aluminum hard drive racks and I noticed that this one is a little bit lower on the quality than all the previous ones I have. When you lock in the drive you can almost still pull the drive out. I think actually a little effort would allow you to but I don't want to ruin mine so I don't try too hard. My older ones still work great. The flaw isn't in the removable tray but in the actual rack itself.One feature I really like about these is that they use the connector on the drive itself to interface with the rack which connects to the mother board. Most racks I've owned, the hard drive has to plug into a connector in the back of the tray which connects to the rack which is then connected to the motherboard.As far as function, these seem to run fairly cool with all the aluminum they are made of and function as well if not better than any rack system I've used."
3,This movie was very informative,I would suggest this movie for every dinosaur on crocodile fan. It is very informative and interesting. I thought it was very animated as well.
2,down load took 2 hours,not even feature length size movie and it took over two hours and hogged my lap top. i won't be down loading from unbox until the speeds are increased and a price drop for movies.
5,"Review of ""Review on the purchase of ""Mechanics for Engineers, Statics by by Ferdinand Pierre Beer""","When I purchased Mechanics for Engineers, Statics by by Ferdinand Pierre Beer"" Being a used book and for the low price I bought it for I was expecting to find it in a lot worse condition than it was. It was a great deal. The cover of the book was a bit dirty but that was it. The book was just what I needed for my class and it was a lot cheaper than buying it at the book store on campus. The book at the book store was priced at $180 and I got it here on amazon for $90. Saving money and passing classes, That's the way to go!Mechanics for Engineers, StaticsProduct Link"
3,"Big Dr. Bronner's fan, but..............","I don't like the bar soap nearly as much as the liquid. And, the lavender scent was, well, nauseating -- may be just me. Anyway, I'm going to try the peppermint bar just to be sure. The bar is easier to use than the liquid for bathing, but I use the liquid for shampoo. Don't not try it -- you may really like the scent."
4,"Review of ""Slender is the Thread""","This book almost tells the reader more than he wants to know. How could crooked politicians, coal and lumber companies take such advantage of a poverty stricken and illiterate people to hold them down like animals (or worse) generation after generation? The stories are fascinating but there is always the underlying sadness of knowing this actually happened and much of it still thrives. Little has changed in 200 years."
4,The best book about nothing in particlar,"Groucho Marx tells you nothing about his life, nothing about his hopes, dreams, mistakes and successes and yet he tells you a great deal about everything without every really letting you in to the life of Groucho.At the start I had hoped for a little more substance, but was ultimately very satified with the random wander through his life experances in a very interesting style.If you like Groucho and want a book that you can pick up and read a few pages every so often without losing the plot then this is the one for you!I recommeded this to all Marx Bros aficionado's"
4,Groucho and Me,As a child I couldn't see the fasination that my Dad had with The Marx Brothers and Groucho in particular. But after reading Groucho and Me I've gained a whole different perspective and respect for the Character but mostly for the Man himself.
4,Delightful autobiography by a great comedian,"As an exact tracing of the life and times of Julius Henry Marx, this isn't much of a book. As a series of anecdotes detailing a life in show business during the first half of the 20th century, it's a masterpiece. There was a time in American history when being an actor was still a low-class and suspect profession, paid poorly and with no prestige. Still, it got girls. Marx's trademark irreverence and irascibility are more than present on every page of this book, and reading it all the way through without laughing out loud will be a challenge. Its only real flaw is that towards the end, as it wanders into the fifties, it reenters a world we know of, and seems to almost degenerate into celebrity gossip. Nonetheless, the earlier parts remain a genuine delight"
4,"Well, that's Groucho for you","I didn't really know what to expect from this book. The back cover catergorizes this as FILM/BIOGRAPHY...so it kind of makes sense that film comes first. I can't remember the last time I laughed this hard reading a book this frequently. Less interesting in the 3rd quarter of the book, but the rest is fantastic. I'm not sure where I would categorize this book, because it's a mixed bag all over the place. Definitely interesting to read. A fascinating outlook on the history of entertainment, vaudeville, cinema, radio, and tv. How about Groucho reflects on growing up, his family, why he wanted to get into show biz, and how he succeeded...then tells us about his opinion on Hollywood, parenting, golf, fishing, and ends with a few really funny chapters about where he ended up."
5,GROUCHO!!!!!!,"""Groucho and Me"" is one of the most enjoyable pieces of written work I've ever read. Mr. Marx is undeniably one of the greatest comedians of all time, and his wit, wisdom, and genius come across in this humorous tome of stories from the life of Groucho. We learn about his meager beginnings in upper Manhattan, poverty, tough kids of the streets, and his beginnings in show business. Anybody who is a fan of Groucho will simply HAVE to read this brilliant piece of Marxicana!"
2,It was great until I got to the pages that were repeated,"I was enjoying this book until I discovered that approximately 30 pages were missing. Instead of those pages, the previous 30 pages had been repeated. Since the first copy I bought (not through Amazon) was so unsatisfactory (had extensive water damage) I feel chagrined that this copy is also unsatisfactory.As to the merits of the book itself, it is amazing that Groucho was a grade-school dropout. He is articulate, he is sly and knowing, andthis is the image we all have of him."
3,Entertaining book but not a lot of detail,"I found Graucho's biography interesting but he left out many things about his personal life. He talked very little about his family and brothers. He did not get into his personal life as freely as his brother Harpo. If you want to read a frank and upfront book about the brother's personal life read Harpo's book, Harpo Speaks."
3,They held a gun to his head,"I am sure Groucho regretted agreeing to writing the book as soon as he got his first advance and his editor kept asking for some proofs and chapters. This was obvious throughout. But he managed to provide some entertainment, and did regale us with tales of woe and hilarity, spiced with insight. His failed investments after the Depression, the funeral of Harpo, stupidity at customs, insomnia, and the utter ridiculousness of him trying to write this memoir actually wound up making for a good read, made less painful because of its brevity. I've always been a Groucho fan because of his irreverance- a trait I ""inherited"" from him, much to the chagrin of my employers."
2,Groucho is unwilling to reveal his later life honestly,"If you can ignore the tired witticisms, the writing isn't bad. Although he tells much about his early life struggle with poverty and vaudeville, Groucho is unwilling to reveal his later life honestly and so the last third of the book descends into funny stories and a comic routine, which really is neither funny nor autobiography. For a real honest autobiography, read Ragman's Son by Kirk Douglas."
3,Fun for 10 minutes,"Duke Nukem' - Time to Kill was fun when I was playing playstation and there was no such thing as a next generation system, however, after playing a PS3 or Xbox 360 the game isn't what you remember. It has weird controls, horrible graphics and highly repetitive game play. A game I recommend not actually paying for and just allowing yourself to feel nostalgia over every once in awhile."
4,Not for tall people,"This came as a queen size but it is short in the crotch area. I am 5'9"" and it was not long enough. It is a great item, looked good except for the issue above."
2,"Too bulky, not particularly sleek","These things are huge - as in more than 8 1/2 inches from bottom to top.8 1/2 inches is big, bulky and limits the types of bottles you can use the produce for. For example, looking to use these in a bottle of Port - probably too long for that or most other liquor height bottles.Also does not fit tight in bottles without standard rims (like twist off caps).As far as sleekness, there is something to be desired here - they look very plasticy on top, again much bigger in person than in the picture - and the pink hue is more pronounced as well."
2,Poor design for a pourer,"This was not as I thought it would be. I have another wine pourer which is one solid piece plus the stopper that fits in the top,(made out of stainless) This was a piece of plastic with a long piece that went into the bottle, how do you get the last of the wine out. You have to see it to know what I mean. Anyway I would not suggest this as there are better more solid ones out there."
5,Took long enough...,"Having seen Drawing Flies in it's very limited Festival release over 5 years ago, I am thrilled finally be able to own this picture. I had even gone so far as to call View Askew to beg for a video transfer from the celluloid, but to no avail...I have to say that I am happy with the project overall. Frankly, the quality isn't that great (as I am sure you will hear many people say), but the quality on this dvd is honestly better than the version I saw in the festival (which I think was beta). I know Indie DVD did a lot of work on restoring the print and I think they did a fairly good job considering what they had to work with.All in all, the film isn't the best ever, but it is certainly one that grows on you. Also, the story is just plain fun and the dueling Jasons really steal the show. I recommend it for any film buff who likes a little campiness here and there. And if you like this, check out Tail Lights Fade, also by Gissing and Ingraham."
4,The goodies...,"If you're a die-hard Kevin Smith fan (who does make a cameo), this is a must for your collection. As with most View Askew releases, it's a pretty well-loaded DVD:- Directors cut of the movie w/ additional scenes,- boopers/outtakes,- an introduction by Kevin Smith and Producer Scott Mosier,- audio commentary with the View Askew gang,- easter eggs."
2,I Really Wish I Could Say It was Better,"I love Kevin Smith and all his View Askew films. This is not at that level. The low-budget style does not work like it did in Clerks. Besides Lee and occasionally Mewes, the acting is week and dialouge is messy and not as strong as a typical View Askew film. I went into this movie with modest expectations and really wanted it to be another View Askew classic but alas it is not.Acting: 3 star (Lee's charecter is quite good and he pulls it off nicley, but no other actors resenated with their charecters)Plot: 1 1/2 star (perhaps the poorest execution of a potentially funny story, just didn't match up)Production: 2 star (knowing they had little resources it wasn't bad, but still not even the same level as Clerks, audio is terrible)Overall: 2 star (I have to be firm but fare, I wanted it to be good, but it really wasn't)"
2,Difficult to watch,"Even for the most diehard Kevin Smith fan, within the first ten minutes you are wishing that the audio boom operator had a clue."
2,"A novelty to own, at best","This film is often billed as the ""lost"" View Askew film. Despite the production credit, make no mistake, this is not the kind of material you'd get from Kevin Smith.While it's kind of cool to own another movie that has all your favorite Kevin Smith alumni, this film has none of the clever dialogue or hilarity you'll be expecting. The plot is basically nil, and the entire movie seems a sad excuse to show people sitting around smoking copious amounts of weed.Jason Lee's performance is great, considering the writing he has to work with, but his then wife's performance (Carmen Lee) takes [her attitude] to a whole new level.If it's really cheap and you want it for the novelty of having the ""lost"" View Askew film, then go for it. Just don't expect to be entertained in the least."
4,iSkin Duo...the Nano Bodyguard,Great protection. Clickwheel works like its not even there. I use an adhesive screen protector along with it. Attaches to your armband and will not fall off. Buy it...Love it!
4,Cheap and they work!,"I bought these for two reasons: 1 - I paint a lot (walls). 2 - I have little nieces and nephews who like to ride on my back as I crawl on the floor! For the former, they work great- they don't add any weight to me as I walk around and go up and down ladders, etc. I can get on the floor and paint near the baseboard while on my knees. It's great. My knees aren't the best and these help a lot! For the latter reason, they're great too! I can quickly get these on and then let one or two (or three!) of my plentiful and beligerent nieces and nephews ride on my back around the house! Good excercise and quite tiring! But for the price - you can't go wrong."
2,Not heat resistant,"I made the mistake of leaving these in the sun about 2 hours and they flattened out, losing their contour. One even turned inside out. Spend a little extra and buy something more durable"
1,What happened?,"Purchased them last August and LOVED them!Started using them again this year, maybe 1/2 dozen times so far, and one of the knee pads flattened out. They are kept on shelf in my garage and nothing is placed on top of them. Went in the other morning and one was perfectly FLAT! They are still wearable but awkward and annoying if you are getting up and down a lot."
1,worst,These have to be the worst pair of knee pads I have ever bought. I have large kneesand they still fell down every time I put them on. I am very disapointed in these.
5,Knee pads,I clean apts/homes after a tenant has moved out so I spend alot of time on my knees and need comfortable yet protective knee pads. I have tried many different knee pads and found these to be the best. Some are too hard and hurt the knee when kneeling and some are too soft/thin and don't have enough protection against the hard surface. The only thing I don't like about these is the strap with the velcro gets stretched out easy and I have to do some sewing to tighten it up. Otherwise they are great.
5,Wonderful Knee Pads!,"I purchased the Fiskars 9418 Ultra Light Knee Pads in fall 2011 because I was installing a patio and knew I would be spending a lot of time on my knees placing the pavers. They were wonderful! I wore them for two full days of work, much of the time spent kneeling on the concrete pavers themselves or on the compacted limestone base, and never experienced any pain in my knees. They are so comfortable, I also often forgot I was wearing them. Since then, I have also worn these kneepads when I needed to kneel in limestone gravel, working on projects on my carport floor, and when gardening. Though they don't look so hot anymore (I'm not sure the limestone dust will ever totally come out), the foam is not damaged and they have held up great. They are easy to put on and remove, and I've never had trouble with them shifting during use. Seriously, these knee pads are about the best $10 I have ever spent."
3,They make the back of your knees sweat,"These work well if you are in a cooler environment and you can work in long pants. However, we live in FL and often work in shorts. These pads make the front and back of your knees sweat if worn with shorts. There is nothing breathable between your skin and the pads."
3,wish i had bigger legs,"These kneelers are soft and comfortable--but the elastic is just too long for me. That is, the overlap with the velcro ends overlaps too far and misses the sticky part. So I can't get them snug enough to be very secure. But then I'm smaller (if not really skinnier, sadly enough) than most people. If they fit right, I think they'd be really nice under-knee."
2,For large knees only,"I was disappointed that the velcro straps on these pads have a very limited range, and are suitable only for large knees. I have an average man size knee, and these pads fit too loosely. Also, the felt lining inside the rubber is starting to peel around the edges after only five days of wear."
2,Not for bird legs...,If you have skinny legs these pads are not for you. The straps don't have enough velcro coveage....
3,Good,"Nothing wrong with Jell-O Sugar-Free Gelatin Dessert, Black Cherry, 0.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24), no surprises. Once you try one you basically try them all. 3 Stars."
3,"Pretty Good Jacket, Weird Smell","It's a pretty good jacket, but when I received it, it had a weird rubber tire smell. It took a couple of washes to get it out"
3,runs a bit large.,i'm a female who usually wears L or XL. i ordered a large in this jacket and it is too big for me. i'll probably give it to my dad. but i really like the jacket itself so i might reorder a M and try that one on for size.
3,Birchwood Casey Super Blue,"Do not see much difference between this and other Birchwood Casey blueing products, it takes more than one coat to get a dark blue. Don't expect much, and you will be less likely to be disappointed."
5,Great Stuff!,I use this gun blue to refinish iron parts on many of my antique tool collection. Beautiful patina - plus - wonderful rust preventer.
5,Next best thing to professional.,"I purchased this for my husband as he was cleaning two old rifles that he has. He applied two coats, waiting a day in between. The results were very nice, I know nothing about true bluing, but I could definitely tell a huge difference."
5,Awe Inspiring Scenery,"Tania and Lana are certified yoga instructors. Lana's recovery from a head on collision that left her body shattered is testimony to the power of her yoga. The words and imagery are inspiring and the moves are practical and advanced. This video will remain a classic long after the others have gone.The scenery of Oak Creek and Sedona's Red Rocks are breath-taking and professional. Also be sure to check out their multiple Award Winning Children's' Book - ""How Butterbees Came to Be""."
2,Nice to look at; instruction lacking,"If you've done yoga to a video tape before, you know that the only time you'll ever keep your eyes on the screen is, perhaps, the first time you play it. In this tape, the instructor guides you into the pose verbally, then says ""repeat on the other side"", and then nothing; she leaves you no time cues about when she's ready to move on to the next thing. This ruins the tape for all practical purposes. Also, there's lot's of useless advice like ""be limber"". And lots of flowery imaginative suggestions that are distracting and counter productive to emptying the mind of thought. Plus she doesn't give you enough time to develop those fantasies if you're inclined to do so. The two stars are for the beautiful photography and the creative mirroring of poses by the instructor's look-alike sister."
3,cute but boring,I thought this would be a fun addition to our Plan Toys airport but my 3-yr-old doesn't play with it at all. Maybe an older child with a very active imagination might play with it more. Ours is just decoration on a bookshelf. It's little but well-made.
2,My experience,"I agree that this is a beautiful product; however, I returned these earrings not long ago. The reason is that there is a half arrow at the end of the hook which is used to lock the earring. I tried to wear them, but the half arrow was too big, and I couldn't get them through my earlopes."
2,I returned them,"For jewelry I purchase from Amazon these were on the higher end of a medium price, if that makes any sense. So I expected more. They really did remind me of tin foil. I did like the hooks they use but the earrings are very fragile and dull. I returned them."
3,False advertising,The mixer was advertised as a 300 watt and when it was recieved it was a 275 watt. It was suppose to include the pouring shield and there was no pouring shield. My suggestion would be to make sure you have the right description of the item and a correct list of items included. The mixer itself is ok would have preferred the 300 watt but I will keep but the seller should have to pay the shipping if I had decided not to keep it because of the false advertising. I would not buy from the supplier of this item again because of the false advertising.
5,Best at what it does,"I recently purchased this brand and type after checking several others for the purpose of heating my 2-car, 440 sq ft, insulated garage. After spending literally hours poring over other suitable types, I decided on this radiant heater. It is very conservative on usage of propane, even left on medium and high. I had it in a 1200 sq ft area in below freezing temperatures for about 10 hours and though it wasn't terribly warm while I was working it was enough to keep the chill off and I wasn't even shivering! It heats up fully in a matter of a couple minutes and even when I knocked it over it didn't damage it at all. Most of the other units I looked at were in the $200-$300 range for the area desired and were electric. I am very happy with this little heater and I'm sure you, given similar needs, will find it to be reasonably priced, effective and efficient."
5,What a Little Gem!,"We heat differently then most folks; just the room that we're in instead of the whole house. For the past 20 years or so we got along just fine with a kerosene heater even though it was a bit of a pain having to fuss with pouring fuel into the tank with a funnel and the odor when you first fired it up. Last year clear grade kerosene jumped to $3.49 a gallon and this year $6.21. I saw this little heater and with propane only $1.65 a gallon I figured - No Brainer!!! Right out of the box and onto a five gallon tank took all of five minutes and this little gem worked flawlessly the first time and ever since. No hassle, no pouring, no warm up period, no wick burn off every week, no odor at all, just instant, focused heat. Great value for the price!"
5,"this is good for outdoor heating only, but works very well","use this in my green house in the dead of winter. I turn it way down by carefully cutting down the valve on the tank. the low setting is almost too high for my needs. But, I can get several weeks of night time operation out of one 4.6 gallon tank of propane. if you turn it up, it really puts out a lot of heat. Oh yeah, dont touch it when it is glowing red!"
5,Fast Heat,"This heater is easy to connect, easy to ignight, and pumps out some serious heat fast! Winter isn't in full swing so haven't used it too much yet. I still wish I would have bought one of these years ago."
3,MR. HEATER,"I purchased this heater for the garage and for camping. When I opened the box, I noticed that the temperature knob was floating around the box. I tried to re-attach it but it was cracked. I didn't try to send it back because of an upcoming camping trip so I ""MacGyvered"" it. It seems to be holding for the time being. aside from this issue, the heater works very well."
4,Hot!,"This little pup puts out a ton of heat! So much, in fact, that it needs another stop on the low end. I can set it low, but I have to hold the knob in place with a push pin, or it slips and shuts off. Otherwise, I love it!"
5,George@woodjig.com. Has served the shop well!,This a very good heater for the shop! It runs for a long time on one tank of propane. It is a nice heater to at least break the chill in very cold weather or a large shop or area. It can be a valuable back up in case of any problems with your primary source of heat too. Highly recommended and a great price here!
4,Not what I hoped...,"I bought this supposing I could use it indoors with an open window for ventillation but it creates a very upleasant odor and I wouldn't recommend it for enclosed areas. Rather I would use it for camping, hunting or out on the deck. It doesn't radiate the heat much out in front but mostly upward so it is nice to just stand over it to get warm. It was rather easy to install and light so I can recommend it for such purposes as described."
4,Really handy tool.,"I bought this little heater last November. Here in south Louisiana, we get all of about 5 weeks of winter a year. Well, during our winter, some of the our guys on our trim crew (interior residential trim) HATE the cold , so I got this to put in the house to warm up with. ALL OF US LOVE IT , we ended up putting it in any small bedroom and, while it takes a few minutes for it to warm up a bedroom, it does fine , and we could get around 5 days of use before having to fill up the tank again. The only reason I did not give it five stars was because the piezo ignition went out after about a week, not a really big deal, but it should have lasted longer I believe."
4,Works well,"My basement is temporarily unheated and I have this and two other types of heaters. The other two are Sengoku 10,000 btu and Sengoku 23,000 btu kerosene heaters.This one is good for heating a space up quickly and it has no odor. Unfortunately, it is fairly expensive to run and I don't run it for any length of time. The Sengoku 10,000 is better for my purposes - heating an area for around 8 hours. If the basement is cold, I may run the propane heater for 30 minutes to get it warmed up and let the other heater run for the day."
1,DANGEROUS- DO NOT USE,"this product burned down my tent in cold weather. It spits propane balls of fire when the tank gets cold, then catches fire. Glad i was awake or i wouldnt be writing this. This Product is god awful dangerous if used for camping.The sunbeam version is what we had. DO not use in an enclosed cold area. I switched to Mr Buddy Heater brand."
2,Disappointed,"I read the reviews and for the first time, I ordered based on the reviews. I had intended on ordering the double burner, but was persuaded by the review that I should get the single because it just puts out so much heat that it will be all I need.I am disappointed in the size of the heater. It states that it is a 8000 to 14000 btu heater. I already have my doubts that it will do what I need it to do just because it is so small. I really thought the heater would be much larger than it is."
2,Too wimpy,"Pros: It's well made and not hundreds of dollars.Cons: Several. You get the heating capacity you pay for, and this thing is simply wimpy. I use it in a standard 2-car garage which is finished and somewhat insulated, near Sacramento California in the foggy winters. It took 2 or 3 hours, at full on, to raise the temperature of the garage by more than 5 degrees. That was with a small fan blowing across it to circulate the air, main and side door closed, with 4 small screened openings for ventilation. The instructions clearly say to provide ventilation but don't say if it produces CO (carbon monoxide), so I'm going to get a detector.This model doesn't have an ignitor so get some matches or a handheld ignitor.Do not use near animals or children!! It gets very hot and will burn!Cannot recommend this as a space heater for anything larger than a tent or very small space. More BTUs are needed."
1,Returned it !!,"I've owned these in the past but the quality has been slipping dramatically. Had to return my last one. When firing up it howled so loud it sounded like it was possessed. The howling continued, painfully loud, for over two minutes. Decided it wasn't worth it. Don't waste your money."
2,Hey.... What am I missing Here,"I purchased this heater after reading the glowing reviews. I am not pleased with it at all. I live in the southwest so we don't have very cold winters where I am. I have a two car enclosed garage attached to the house. I set up the heater and put it on high and checked the temperature and it was 40 degrees. I came back in one hour and the temperature was about 41 degrees. This has happened three to four times with almost no increase in temperature.... and no my thermometer is working. The unit does work and it feels like it is putting out heat within a few feet but does nothing overall. Would like to give a good review, but can't."
1,"Well, if it works when it arrives . . .","Mine was broken when it arrived. The vendor dragged things on with lots of dumb ideas, then grudgingly sent me a replacement part that didn't fix the problem and then stopped returning my calls and e-mails. If you get one that works, it may be great. if you get a broken one don't expect any customer service."
2,Feeble little heater,This heater is a little weak when heating an insulated garage when it is between 10 and 20 outside. Better get the 25k btu version.This doesn't have a built-in piezo electric igniter either. So you need a long stem lighter.There are better heaters like this. Don't bother with this one.
5,This review doesnt qualify but,"April, 2012Its my only chance to speak so here goes:It arrived on time and packaged perfectly so 5 stars for that. However I have not had a chance to try it because my fiance put her foot down and said ""no chance"" until we own and install a CO2 detector. The only way around that was to buy a catalytic version- much smaller- which I did do.For the record AEP- American Electric Power and PUCO got too chummy in December, 2011 and had thousands of complaints (Ohio) (yes you can google this) and made my decision for me to learn how to get off the grid. So THANK you to Amazon for being there for me to shop."
1,A Complete Joke,"I bought the DVD as a fan of Supernatural Documentaries. Some of the stories from the Inn Owners were interesting, but the DVD was ruined by the psychic Cathe who is so incredibly unbelievable it was painful! Cathe... some advice, usually there is a point when contacting the dead; I've seen better psychics at the carnival. Watching Cathe make small talk with empty space is really boring, and then finally, of the so called most incredible ghost video ever was so obviously faked by placing glass in front of the camera that it just is insulting."
1,What a Joke,"The Inns in this video may very well be haunted, but Cathe the ""psychic"" tragically ruins any reputable evidence these Inns may have collected prior to her ""investigations"". Every time they take a photo you can see her deliberately kicking up dust; touching the dirt floor, then smacking her hands together, telling spirits to ""sit down on the chair"" as she dusts off the [clean, padded] chair for them. A complete joke."
1,boring,i have many paranormal/documentary dvd's and found this to be quite boring I really disliked the medium Cathy. I found her quite annoying. Have seen much better. I disliked that they did not give a good history about each inn. Felt a little left out in the cold about some of the facts they were talking about and felt they should have given more information.
1,More like Americas Most Boring Inns.,This is a horrible DVD! Not worth the money. It's bad...I mean BAD! And not in a good way! I don't believe Cathe the psychic one bit. And some of the affects are obvious fakes. You'd be better off purchasing a brick and watching that...it would be more entertaining!!!
1,amateurish,"This is a ridiculous, amateurish product. It is poorly edited and full of exclamation points, odd abbreviations and poor grammar. The content is poorly organized and presented. It has the appearance of someone's personal notes, electronic published.There are much better instructional materials on music theory available."
4,Really Dope.,"I have to admit, I listened to this album constantly when it came out. It's what I think of as Ice Cube's g-funk album. I say that because I think this was his answer to ""The Chronic"" and ""Doggystyle"". A few tracks I don't care for much, but the better ones make it worth owning. ""Really Doe"" and ""Ghetto Bird"" are both great, and ""You Know How We Do It"" is a cruising classic. ""Bop Gun"" is a sweet party track, because of it's length, and the fact that George Clinton is on it. I also dig the groovy ""Make It Rough, Make It Smooth"", ""Down For Whatever"", and ""When I Get To Heaven"". All on the mellow side. As for the bonus tracks, I don't think they're half as good as the bonus tracks on ""The Predator"", but with the remastering I'll take 'em. This is also another Cube disc that's heavy on the pro-black/anti-white thing, fyi. Still though, a must for bigger fans, others can probably stick with the ""Hits""."
3,Shades of Old Cube,"This CD has some fine moments on it, but it lacks the cohesion, confidence and conviction of Amerikkka and Death Certificate. It used to seem real but by this album it just sounds like Cube's trying to capture a market demographic and watching Cops for lyrical inspiration. And while it's musically more diverse, wasn't it Ice Cube derisively suggesting newcomers like Warren G new-jack swing on his nuts for trying to change things up a bit? It's a good record but it's not a good Ice Cube record."
2,Disappointing,"At the height of west coast ""gangsta(g)-funk movement"" this album was a let down. Sound quality was good, but the album was just a failure. Don't waste your money. Instead buy his first two solo albums."
2,Great talent ruined by questionable lyrics,The title says it all. Ice Cube's undeniable talent was definitely misguided by his Afrocentrist and racist lyrics.
2,Where is the ICE CUBE I know ?,"What happened ? Ice Cube is my favorite rapper of all time! For anyone else this would have been 3 stars, but this is a real disappointment to me persoanlly. If you like the older HARD hitting Ice Cube and NWA I would try one of his earlier releases. Who knows though... I love plenty of CDs that I hated at first."
2,"He's a G, a'right, and not much else","Misogynistic and numb-skulled, he tells anyone that'll listen that he's a ""motherf----n' G,"" then goes on to spin lines like ""You lookin' for a punk with benefits/'Cause you got a baby that take many sh--s/And you know I got a grip like a baby on a t-t."" He may be the original gangsta, but this is gangsta rap at its worst. Once I thought he was amusingly ridiculous. Now I realize he just sucks."
3,Rhythm of the jinx,"The rhythm of the jinx or hoodoo music is ok. I use to listen to the album quite a bit when I was younger but as I get older I think this guy is just subliminal. I did not know you could jinx when you actually advertise yourself to the public or when responding to others comments not directed at them? the power of the jinx has gone too far. The beats are none other than subliminal it is what to be expected. Like all rap albums like this though when ice cube is 60 or 65 you will listen to probably Marvin Gaye or the Supremes, or anything Motown or Chess."
4,My favorite Ice Cube CD/ Very creative,"This CD is very creative. Ice Cube also works with George Clinton, which is pretty funky. This CD just tells you how it is, and makes alot of sense to me."
5,Read this,This is the best Ice Cube CD yet. Ghetto bird is the best song on hea. Buy this CD. Its ill.
3,Pretty Good but the Formula is starting to set in,"Ice Cube is a Legend in the Game.but this Disc while Pretty Good does have Formula Creeping in.the songs that stand out are Ghetto Bird,You Know How we Do It,What Can I Do?(Which Puts America on Notice for The past 400 Years)When I Get To Heaven is a Solid Track.but the rest of The Disc is Formula and starts going down and He hasn't Recovered Yet.still when he is on He can't be Faded."
5,Cube's Best.,This is Ice Cube's best album ever. Ghetto Bird is the best track on this album and best he ever made. If ya want the best gangsta rap ever get this won.
1,Cannot believe the fashion reviews,"The product is dark for a ""light"" based concealer, it goes on too thick and does not cover dark circles very well. Had to let it set and then repeat which by lunch time left a mess under my eyes.I will use my store brand stick which is goes on as ""light"", is smooth and covers in one application."
3,Pretty good book,"I bought this book hoping to read about Christophers trip to the new land, but instead got details about Queen Isabel's inquisition against the Jews, the war against the Arabs, and Christophers life and efforts to hide his Jewish background. His trip and discoveries were mentioned briefly in the last three pages.This book however was enjoyable, and I do recommend it. It follows the efforts of Queen Isabel to finance her war, the problems the Inquisition caused, the war against the Arabs,and Christopher Columbus's efforts to get approval for his voyage. Too bad it's out of print."
3,"Fun, but not too much","my 4 year old is a Toy Story fan. He enjoyed the game for about 30 minutes, and after that went back to SuperMario. He use it at least once a week, but not he's number one.Is a good game for variety, but not as a principal game.The graphics are not as good as Spyro, or monster inc, not even supermario and the race gets a little bit boring after a while..."
4,"User-friendly memory enhancing strategies, tips, and techniq","Easy-to-apply memory tips and techniques for learning names when being introduced, remembering numbers and dates, and reducing absentmindedness. The hints are user-friendly and can be used in social situations as well as in business."
4,Worth the read for a first novel.,"I was interested in this novel for two reasons. One, I'm a Sledge originally form Louisiana and two, I had just returned from New Orleans when the book was published, I was delighted to find out that the author will give the name of Sledge a good turn. He wrote a captivating, engrossing mystery. After having been in New Orleans in July, I could feel the heat in the streets there as he described it. It was a pleasure to read a story with interesting characters and scenerios. I hope he writes another soon."
5,It Is about the sam as thug,dont get me rong thug is a game but to me thp8 was just a rerun of thug and thps i liked it overall theres good glitches and u can walk around and stuff but to me it is jus a skating game
5,every woman should read this book,"this book is fantastic, describes female anatomy and physiology in detail, all the interesting bits, the bits that will contribute towards your mind blowing orgasms. she writes with humour and accuracy, shannon has done her research.this book is the bible of female pleasure and orgasms, im not kidding, i highly recommend it."
3,Eastwood After Hours,This was not what I expected. Hoped to see more of Clint Eastwood performing. I didn't realize this was basically a concert performed for Clint Eastwood. He did play at the end which was a definite treat.
5,Eastwood After Hours (Live At Carnegie Hall),"There are so many great things about this album; but forme it is the intermingling of the old players with the new.I mean you know how great the old guys are, but I was blownaway with the work of the new ones. I think the worries yearsago that jazz and this type of jazz would be lost at some point,can be put to rest.The only negative was the frequent clips of scenes from Clint'smovies. But then again, if it wasn't for Clint, we wouldn't havesuch a wonderful, finger-snappin', God I love it! DVD."
2,Eastwood After Hours,"A bit disappointing, I had hoped to see more of Clint Eastwood actually playing or at least, a bit more participation."
1,An Audio Disaster,"All of the songs on this album with a couple of exceptions, are favorites of mine. This HQ 180 gram Rhino Vinyl Reissue, pressed by RTI, obstensibly comes from the original master tapes. However,if true,the original mastering leaves much to be desired. The original recording engineers were Bill Schwartau and Tom Dowd. I have a very revealing high-end system that clearly demonstrates the audio shortcomings of this album. Its lack of clarity from an abundance of distortion, and the absence of musical elements(Ray's piano) from the mix make it extremely difficult to genuinely enjoy Ray Charles's ""Genius"".Michael Miguest[...]"
2,Okay,"This was an okay book, just not my favorite. It did have some helpful stories and can relate to a lot of the problems teens have today, but some of the stories just seemed to drag on and have not point to them. Other than that, this was a very good book."
3,It Realated,I like the book because it realated to everyday life and some of the stuff or stories in the book reminded me of me. I like changes so i thought if i read this book it would be good.
2,YUCK!,We own 2 of these drives. My husband just got his out to use it and the rubber on it is all sticky. I got mine out and it is the same way! Who wants to deal with something that gets all gooey collecting dirt and dust when the object is to keep your records SAFE!Will be replacing with something that isn't Matsunichi!
1,Don't buy,This drive failed after 2 months of very careful use. Since there is no serial number on the drive and I threw away the packaging (big mistake)there is no way to exchange it.
2,Struggle,This is a good book for postgraduate maths students. Even though my first degree was in maths I still could not follow the notation given in this book. I struggled with following the material and never got to the end of the book. I will have to come back to this book in a few years once I have developed the skills elsewhere.
4,Great taste but has more peel than expected.,Love the shelf-life and flavor. Great to get just tomato without chemicals. Do have to work at getting peels out if you are not going to puree the sauce.
4,My Kind Of Planet!,"Planet of the Vampire Women is the most fun I've had watching a vampire movie since Blood On The Highway. I'm not going to say it's a great movie, because it's not. But it is a guilty pleasure kind of movie. The movie runs 95 minutes, and the first hour or so are pretty average. Well, other than the boobs. But the third act kicks butt, with a load of gore and plenty of sexy vampire women baring their fangs. Worth seeing if you're a b-movie fan."
4,Great Educational Tool!,I recommend this for anyone doing evolution in their classroom. It is inexpensive and was in great condition. My students really enjoyed this VHS.
4,Questionable Content,"I really enjoyed the video & aggree with CALLAHAN. But there's some questionable content that I feel worth bringing up. First off, the video shows a bat that fell onto the guano below where I bunch of insects were feeding off of it. Then it showed the insects eating the bat too!Also, there is a pool in Lechuguilla Cave where cavers need to wade through it to get to the other side. But they're worried about getting the water dirty so two men go into the water naked! They only show the back side of one of them, but I just felt worth bringing this up.I had the intentions of converting the VHS tape to DVD with a USB video capture devise. So when I had the video on the computer, I edited out the bad parts before putting it on the DVD."
5,Incredible! Powerful!,"I was blown away by this movie. It's kind of difficult to watch. It's not something you just throw on for entertainment. It's a serious movie about a serious matter. Angelina Jolie did a fantastic job writing this and directing it. I was very surprised. It seemed like a movie that a man would've made. Obviously she brings to light important issues that are and have gone on in the world unnoticed. Horrible tragedies while we all live in our bubbles unscathed. I didn't even know this went on which shows how much of a bubble I live in, but now it's had me investigate this in a deeper way. I guess she's changed one person's perception then she did her job. Great movie as I said, but it's no a happy movie. It does give you a glimpse into real life and not Hollywood fantasy."
4,Foreign movie lover,"This movie gives a very realistic depiction of war. The sad thing is if the war hadn't happened, then, maybe they might have stood a chance."
1,Boring!,"I really thought this film directed by Angelina Jolie would be a thoughtful, thought provoking piece.. It wasn't ! The action was way too slow.. Plot plodding and no heat between actors.. Not enough action in a war torn star crossed lover film it could've been...def not worth the time money or effort! I stopped watching half way they and I always finish movies! Don't wast time or money in this one!!!"
5,A very enlightening movie about a forgotten war.,"Angelina Jolie did a fantastic job in directing and writing this movie. It's subject matter may be a little dark, but it is a story that needs to be told."
3,ok,"ok, a lot of violence. Acting was good, it is a sad subject. I don t think I would watch it again."
1,Very Disturbing,This movie may have portrayed the events of war in Bosnia - but it is very painful to watch if you are a woman.The violence against women - sexually and physically - is very difficult to watch - even if it portrays the realities of war.I had to turn off the video before it finished.Be in the mood for war realities or don't watch.
3,"Grim, depressing, and not entertaining","Why would you watch this for entertainment? It is not entertaining. Angelina Jolie makes a directing debut, so you know you are in for a super serious social commentary about the Bosnian War. This is a love story about two star-crossed lovers. But you are also subjected to all manner of atrocities along the way. If you don't mind a lot of senseless slaughter, numerous violent rape scenes, babies tossed out windows, bodies blown up and other unsavory sights, then you may enjoy this for an evening. It is also way too long. I was ready for it to end at 90 minutes and that would have helped. But it drones on for more than 2 hours, so be forewarned."
1,History is written by those who have hanged heroes,"Why did I ever watch this movie...So much tought was put into how to make the Serbs look as much as monsters as it can possibly be, that you, misses Jolie, forgot that acting is what makes a movie believeble. And why not spend more time developing the characters and show their inner war in all that madness, if this was a story about love in a time of war. But no, this movie was made with one purpose only.What pains me the most is that 95% of the viewers will learn about history trough movies like these... I'm sure that events presented in the movie did in fact happen, but when you don't show what the other side did, are you really presenting the truth, if that was you goal, or was it?"
3,In the Land of Blood and Honey,"After spending years in front of the camera as one of the most sought after A-list actresses, Angelina Jolie decided to take a shot at operating behind it, making her writing and directing debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey. Set in Bosnian War-era Sarajevo, Blood and Honey is a dark, disturbing story of star crossed love between a Serbian soldier and his former flame, a Muslim woman now forced into sexual slavery in the camp he oversees. Jolie drew upon her experiences as UN ambassador for inspiration, and I am willing to acknowledge her ambition in the project, even if parts of the story were stretched too thin, the film marked a confidant debut for her. Filmed overseas with local actors from the surrounding regions, it's not the glamorous Hollywood fare normally associated with Jolie's acting roles, but it's an intriguing film, if only to see what potential Jolie might possess as a filmmaker."
4,Disturbing movie,"Excellent first time effort from Angelina Jolie. The movie is disturbing in its scenes of rape, ethnic cleansing and death by snipers in Sarajevo.The film is important because it brings a recent time of death and destruction to the consciousness of the American public."
2,No directions....,"This is my second Heath wireless doorbell. The first lasted fifteen years. However this one does not come with the doorbell button. My fault... but you may make the same mistake. The real problem is that it came with no directions. There were four small black inputs in the package, so I figure this must have something to do with the chimes. Had to go to the company website to download five pages of information on how to set up and program chimes. It's really a simple task, but directions would have helped.Had to rate it before review was accepted, but I really have not set it up yet. Need button."
2,"Great idea, indifferent execution.","Bought the transmitter and two receiver units. All were very simple to install and worked perfectly for about two weeks, after which they began to work intermittently. Sometimes one receiver will activate, sometimes both and sometimes neither.I haven't decided whether it is better to have them running, working only approximately every third time, or whether I would prefer not to have them at all...Heath Zenith SL-6196-C Wireless Additional Plug-In Door Chime Receiver, Off-WhiteHeath Zenith SL-6168-D Wireless Plug-In Chime with Entry-Alert Sensor, White"
1,Would not work in cold weather!,"Really. The buzzer at the front door would not work under low temperatures. But that is a piece that is expected to be placed at the front door, right? Outdoors. I live in the Northeast. If that is your case, you might want to buy a different product."
3,Hit or miss,I bought two. One worked and the other didn't. I returned it and got another one which worked fine. I question the longevity of the product now.
5,can't get any better,"use these things all the time, i bought alot of these from amazon. they all work great, no problems at all, ive been using them for about a year now."
5,"Ah, yes... Why someone should buy Sailor Moon #9...","Okay, I'll admit, this is not the best part of Sailor Moon, but, I still give it 5 stars! Why? Because when you're as obsessed as I am, you love it all!! I've read this book over 100 times!! Part of what I like about it is that it talkes a little bit about the outer senshi's past lives--up until now, you don't truely know what was happening in their lives during the Silver Millenium. I don't want to really tell you the storyline, because I know I hate it when someone slips, and ends up giving part of it away... Okay, I guess that's all there is to say. One more thing, just to inform all of you out there you are going to or have already bought this book (and everyone else, too, I guess): Sailor Pluto Rocks!!! Okay, I'll be quiet now *sigh*"
5,Bold and on the money,"Bold because Ms. Strening points to parents as the most influential people in their children's lives and suggests how we model behavior without realizing it. Her research is excellent, her own extensive experience makes her an ""expert"", her writing is straight forward. The suggestions she makes to help adults bring their children through difficult years in difficult times are simple, doable, and if taken on as a community project, very powerful. As a friend said to me today, we should tell parents to read this book when their children are 2. Mine is almost 17 and it is not too late."
4,You need at leat two!,"One at home (comes with the iPaq) and one more for the office. Unfortunately, you'll also need to buy another AC adapter, or a car adapter (you can be stylin' with your car cradle) if you want to charge the thing. Only 4 stars"
4,Works great,"I've been using the USB cradle for about a year now, and never had any problems with it. One thing I did notice is when there is an expansion pack being used, sliding it into the cradle to connect can be difficult at times. I do recommend having two cradles if you use your Compaq at home and at work."
1,Doesn't work after 2 months,"My IPAQ cradle stopped working after 2 months. The only way I can synchronize my IPAQ is to manulally hold the IPAQ in the cradle and tip it forward. I have to unplug the power from the cradle and plug it directly into the IPAQ to charge the device.Mecahnically, the cradle design simple dosen't cut it."
3,good i guesss,It's good but he gets kind of boring at some point and I didn't like it that much and I didn't finish it.
2,"Shiny, cheap looking folders; Too large to fit in 9x12 envelopes","I was not pleased with this product in person. The picture makes it look like it is more of a matte finish, which is more appropriate for business uses. I also was hoping the folders would fit within a 9x12 envelope which they didn't. Since size wasn't mentioned in the description, I had no way of knowing."
2,Fiskars Knee pads,"Fairly comfortable to wear but will slip if not tightly fastened. Thicker cushioning than most. The BAD part is, the shipping was more than the cost of the knee pads! Don't buy them if you have to pay shipping unless you are really desperate for knee protection."
3,TV MOUNT ADVENTURE,"This is a well made mount however be advised that the bracket is very small so you will need a flat mount frame to make it work with larger TVs. This method increases the space needed by several inches and the price to about as much as the more expensive ones with a full 29"" bracket.I used it anyway and it works well with my 42"" plasma"
4,educational,"This a clever wooden toy, you put together or buy completed. I bought both and found the one I put together was better than the completed one, which had several severe mistakes which kept it from working as it should. It needs to be designed more thoroughly. Turning the handle to make the little figure move, usually made things just fall out of place. It is certainly not possible for a young child to have this as it would fall apart after 5 minutes of play. It is best left on a shelf to look at and think it cleverly built."
1,dissapointment,"I am disappointed with this product as the parts are not identified to match up with instructions to put together and it's a guessing game as to witch part and length is witch as it's In millimeters and I'm not familiar with those and don't want to struggle with trying to put this together. It seems for that kind of money they could have easily Identified the pieces as they are packaged in separate plastic containers and cross referenced the instructions to the pieces. Won't make another purchase from them again, still unsure about returning kit. Patrick"
5,The funkiest of Funkadelic,"I have every Funkadelic release there is........and this is by far the best!!! A little of everything is on this CD and there is not one bad track. ""Soul Mate"" and ""Smokey"" are big time highlights, along with a killer live version of ""Cosmic Slop"". If you have funk, then you have style and you should have this disk......"
3,Egyptian goddesses in Eire,"Damona, servant of Bast, an Egyptian goddess whorshipped by some people in 5th-century Ireland, experiences a frightful tragedy that threatens to turn her from her Goddess. This book is the story of how Damona makes restitution for the evil she brings upon her land. It is also the rather moving story of how Christianity ocmes to dominate Europe and usurp the positions of the old religions, including Druidcraft and goddess worship. It is an exciting book, moving in places, and, while the writing is not exceptional, the historical background is interesting and seems accurate. I recommend it to people who are interested in early medieval Europe or in goddess worship. It is the a book in the Shield of Light series."
2,nothing like the first book,"this book is nothing like the first book. it is simply a fantasy novel (great, if you like fantasy novels in general). However, the texture of the first book is not there (the examination of two cultures clashing with each other. the development of characters. etc.)"
2,"Shrine of Light, The Daughters of Bast","I question myself on why I even finished this novel. From the very beginning, when they sacrificed a cat, I should have realized this is not the book for me, or for animal lovers. I do not like how they mixed and mingled Irish and Egyptian. It just seemed too weird. The main character, Damona, a young priestess, finds her family and home destroyed by Sekhmet, a goddess/lion who has no worshippers of Her own. Damona struggles to keep Bast's holy tradition alive... and struggles between good and evil. This book was not for me, clearly I did not enjoy it. *S*"
3,Regrettable purchase,"I bought this thinking it would help organize my workbench, but it's really a rather large item and if you get several of different sizes, you can easily fill half of your drawer space trying to store your sockets. If your socket set didn't come with a ""briefcase"" type storage case and you have a large garage and work area, these are fine, but if you have a compact space or need to travel with your sockets at all, consider other options."
4,a populist statement,"The movie is very good, not excellent. Spacek and Gibson are both lovable, in different ways of course. Historically the movie is kind of flimsy. There are things in it that could be the 1930s, other things that are more like the 1980s and 1990s, and the blend is not convincing. We are supposed to see a kind of merging of oppressed factory workers and oppresed rural folk, 'the people' against heartless forces that do not respect their dignity. Dramatically, the film works, especially the epic struggle against floodwaters."
1,Except for Spacek and Glenn,"As much as I enjoy Sissy Spacek, this movie proved disappointing. She and Glenn are excellent (so are the 2 kids) but there was nothing about Gibson's character that made me care and his acting is so dreadfully dull. The only chemistry in the entire movie existed whenever Spacek and Glenn were interacting. The scene where he tries to convince her that she could (and could have) done better was very well done.. is there a more ""real"" actress than Sissy Spacek? She is so believable in everything she does. Gibson's character is such a wimp. In the scene where the ""scab"" workers are leaving the mill and taking abuse (understandable) from the striking workers, I kept waiting for Gibson's character to take it for just so long before screaming out ""I have a family too"". He was pathetic. The happy ending with the family of four enjoying a wagon ride was too Hollywoodish. For a far truer look at farmers in difficulty, ""Grapes of Wrath"" has never been improved upon."
1,The River,"I do love this movie,The River, but I do not have a HD-DVD player to play them on.Could you please swap them for regular DVD. I will send back the one you sent me.hddvd"
3,Mixed bag,"Sissy Spacek gives a terrific performance in this seldom-seen ""social problem"" melodrama. The topic is the plight of the independent farmer, who is much more sympathetic than he would ordinarily be because in this film he looks and acts like international superstar Mel Gibson. The genuine item is not half as pretty, of course.Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography is delicate and attentive; Mark Rydell's direction is ham-fisted and silly. The script is pure agitprop, and laughably bad.If this film can be recommended (and I'm not sure it can), it would be for Spacek."
3,The River,"A heart-land tragedy relived annually by the rain and consequential flooding of the family farmland by the adjacent river. Mels' character is sullen and cold. He is the quintessential traditional hardworking farmer. He loves his family and works almost pointlessly to keep them on their doomed property. It's difficult to watch him sulk and suffer inwardly. His character is extremely introverted and stubbornly independent. Sissy Spacek is great as the wife who tries to keep her family's head above water literally. She portrays a strong, willful and faithful person. This is a good rainy night movie. The kids are great actors and contribute a lot to the traditional values and family bonding.The onscreen chemistry between Spacek and Gibson underscores the uncomfortable aura of the marriage in the movie. There's something strange about the couple, something that just doesn't click; a feeling of looming doom regarding their relationship. Scott Glenn's character does not help the uneasy tension."
3,Hard to get off hairy back,"It provided mild relief but was very hard to get off hairy back. I think I'll try something else next time. If you have a hairy back... yeah, go ahead and laugh... but use should be with removal in mind."
2,5* Seller 2* Product,"I had a problem receiving my product but after contacting the seller I received it promptly. Great communication. Unfortunately I dont like the product. It took almost 2 hours for it to get hot. But when you lay down with it on it gets too hot. And it feels more like bee's stinging you than heat. I had to remove mine. Removal felt like taking a bandaid off of a sunburn (which to me is not as bad as being stung by bee's), I guess I'll stick with the hot/cold patches I've been using. Thank you seller for taking pride in keeping your customers happy."
5,They work,"These are great, and they stay on for 12 hours! I have to have these around because heat feels better for fibromylgia than cold."
1,Don't waste your money,"The darn thing only made a bad thing worse. There should be a warning on the packaging: ""On removal, will rip all the hairs off your lower back!"" (That is if you're presumably male and/or have even the lightest amount of hair on the place that you position it. PS: It gave NO RELIEF AT ALL when it was on. The aftermath, was horrid and very painful. If you must use it, shave the area well beforehand."
2,very disappointed,"I usually use the Salonpas hot capsicum patch that I get in local supermarket. They are much smaller, about 4x5"" (guessing). They get super warm and last for at least 8 hours. I use them on my back/hip area. These ""Hisamitsu"" 10 pak patches from Amazon are ridiculously HUGE. I cut them to the size I need. But... they DO NOT get nearly as warm as the ""american"" Salonpas. I barely felt the heat and the heat I did feel lasted just a few hours. In addition, these large amazon patches do not stick very well. They would stick for a short while, then I would have to keep pressing it on. Overall I am very disappointed in the quality and results of the ""hisamitsu"" Salonpas patch."
2,Clone copy seek's 'Third Stadge' praise.,A friend of mine worked in a music store when the Boston album first came out back in the 70's. The demand was so great they didn't bother placing them on the shelf they just opened the boxes and let the public at them. To try and recapture the Boston magic through a compalation album was a nice idea but the true mojo that fire's the fan's cannot be cloned through an album such as this one. To apriciate the journey you simply cannot leave out a song such as 'Peace of Mind' and hope that no one will notice. It's obvious that this venture was a poor attempt to masquerade good intentions under the flag of Corporate America.
3,"Average Best Of CD Complimation, Boston","Like all of the great bands from the 70s, KISS, Ted Nugent, etc... And many many more bands and also some from the 60s, they all came out with too many hits cds. This one is no different what was the point in realesing this CD we already have many other Greatest Hits CDs of Boston why another one? It includes all the average songs, more than a feeling, rock n roll band etc... But if you want just those few songs than buy this CD for 7.18 , or really just download the two songs off itunes if you have it and only spend 2 dollars. But if you dont have itunes than consider buying this CD, but just buy it used for a cent. And also its pretty cheap at how they realese all these hits CDS ecspecially Ted Nugent, theres inleast 10 Hits Cds for him, buy it if you want it or dont buy it and download it."
4,"...from ArtsyFartsy News, October 2008","A few years ago we viewed the elaborate Hockney exhibit of paintings at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It was awesome! Huge paintings and a large variety of smaller portraits mesmerized us with his original point of view and paint handling.After exiting the exhibit, we went right back in again to look a second and a third time. I was also taken with the fact that David Hockney is alive today - a living master showing his work in a major museum.This DVD, David Hockney at the Tate, has Hockney walking around his major retrospective at the Tate, talking about his work. It is enlightening and delightful to listen to him discuss his work - from the earliest portrait of his father to his most recent work. How often do we get an opportunity like this? I was very much moved by this successful painter.A must-see DVD and a must-have if you are interested in hearing a master artist discuss and describe his work in person."
3,"Chair, please",One of the many media formats available of David Hockney. Perhaps no other artist is out there as much as Hockney now especially with the modern media. The number of DVD's and audio/video clips on the internet that Hockney has shared his thoughts on culture and his art makes him the most approachable artist of our times. This particular DVD adds to our knowledge of Hockney's art and it is interesting to see him standing in front of his paintings while talking about them and see the true size and scale of the works in comparison to his stature. Although the film is poorly produced with him uncomfortable standing for 50 minutes while being interview it is an important documentary that should be added to any art library.
4,Heater that works,"I am heating a 150 sq ft space with this 4,000/9,000 BTU unit and it works. The ceramic element was detached when the unit arrived, and it took some figuring to place it back into the unit. Shipping caused the ceramic heat piece to dislocate, break a bit, and I wasn't sure whether it would still work or not. It did with some home engineering. The pilot light goes out easily - beware of drafts. I like that it shuts off when you kick against it inadvertently."
2,Not everybody's buddy,"Most of the nice things folks say about this unit are true. There are a couple nits: if you use the 12' hose you must introduce the gas verrrryyyy sloowwwwwllllyyyy or it trips a pressure switch and you'll have trouble getting it fired up.The biggest nit from my perspective: good luck using the thing over about 5000' elevation. The oxygen safety sensor, while well intentioned, is so sensitive that the unit shuts itself off. Once it does that, good luck getting it re-started or to stay lit even if you thoroughly vent the enclosure or take it outside. Very annoying.So, if you are a sea level camper it's probably dandy, if you are a mountains and high desert camper, probably want to look elsewhere."
2,WHEN it works..it's great.,"I've used this heater for two winters in SoCal. Not a demanding environment--but Mr. Heater was good enough to take the chill off the workshop. I used both the 1lb and 20lb tanks with the heater. It simply has not been used that much.This winter, the heater went dead. The pilot will not stay lighted; the heater will not perform. I've taken the thing apart twice to ""clean"" as suggested by the instructions and on-line rescources. All to no avail.Quite honestly, the concept is great but the heater itself is something of a turkey."
2,Reply about Lack of filter ruined my heater.,"When I pulled my heater out to use it the pilot wouldn't light. I diagnosed my problem to be the regulator, not the control valve. The guy's statement about using a trap (filter) for 20lb tanks is incorrect. If what he said was true why isn't there a trap (filter) on every gas grill, outdoor heater, and any other appliance that normally uses a propane tank other than the 1lb tank? The reason for the trap (filter) is when the gas supply is delivered by iron pipe. Initially the pipe has oil inside it due to the manufacturing process and to prevent it from rusting before it is put into use. The viscosity of the oil is heavy so the trap (filter) collects this oil and later any scale that may occur from the inside surface of the pipe. Without the trap (filter) the oil or particles of scale could end up in the control valve preventing it from operating properly. If you use copper lines or a rubber gas line there isn't any need for a trap(filter)."
1,Better off just burning the money,"If I had rated this product during the first season, I'd have said it was great. However, a few months is all you get. I have gone thru 2 of them now, both with the same result. It works great for a couple months, and then it won't stay lit. I tried customer service, and they were convinced I must have a herd of spiders inside it, and all I'd have to do was clean it out. Tried that, no luck. So with the new one, I covered the opening after every use. Same result. Plan on getting a few months out of it."
1,Poor results,"I had to return this item twice and both times it kept shutting off because of oil coming out of the oriface. Finilly they gave me another one and it did it also. I also returned another one for someone else and they were having the same trouble. We bought fuel from three different places and the same thing happened.Both units would run out of fuel on the small cyl. in about 3 hours. A 20 lb. cyl. would only last 3 days.If your trying to heat a small shop with this there's a fire hazzard if there's saw dust and if any type of air born sprays are used, such as paint, WD40. Poly then it should not be used. It burns the spray and form a noxic smelling gas."
1,Amazon sent me a re-conditioned unit!,Let me start by saying I LOVE Amazon. They've treated me very well and saved me a bundle of money over the years.But.... this time I'm angry. I bought this item last week and Amazon sent me a re-conditioned unit with a 90 day warranty (instead of one year) without telling me. Nowhere on the item description on the Amazon web site does it say that they're selling re-conditioned units.I haven't tried out the heater yet (other than to make sure that it works) so I don't have an opinion on the quality of the item - I'm just upset with Amazon
2,Lack of filter ruined my heater /Parts no longer available,"When I bought my ""Buddy"" MH9B 3 years ago there was no mention of having to use a fuel filter. This lack of information caused my heater to build up with oil from the 20lb tanks I used. The control valve (part # 73416) is shot and no longer available from Mr. Heater. All of the lines have oil residue in them and this heater no longer works. I paid $104.00 for a heater that worked well for only 3 years. Has anyone else had this problem?"
5,Great heater!,"I'm a War Between The States reenactor, and bought this heater to keep me warm in my tent. It certainly does the job, and very efficiently. One canister of propane lasts the whole night. The unit itself is compact, so it doesn't take up a lot of room. One terrific safety feature shuts the heater down if it is bumped. It was a great investment!"
2,Disappointed in altitude restriction....Above 6500'....,"This heater works really well for lower altitudes! It worked great at the house, just not at the camp site. If going up in altitude the low oxygen sensor will not let the burner/heater/pilot light stay lit. I think it says that it is ""recommended"" for use below 7000' somewhere in the owners manual, however, I would put on the label/box ""it does NOT work above 6500'"" I ended up trading it in for a Coleman Power Cat and that works great for what I need it for. But if you live below the altitude and need a great portable propane heater this is it!!! Just didn't work for me :("
3,"At first, swell, but then...","Delighted with the design of this unit. Took it to a freezing cold swap meet in a metal building. Worked great for three hours, then...pffft. Wouldn't relight. Then even the pilot wouldn't light. Luckily, the local Bi-mart swapped me straight across.So...sudden failures are possible. Love the piezo lighter and compact, solid-on-the-floor design. Like the two heating levels. I'm playing music on a hillside on Sunday night, so I'm hoping there are not any more sudden failures."
2,deleted due to stupidity,"I'm deleting my wrongheaded and misinforming review based on research of catalytic...not radiant propane heaters. Serious safety issues surround the use of propane RADIANT heaters by campers. Issues include CO POISONING, radiant heating of combustible materials and asphyxiation.www.carbonmonoxidedeaths.com should be consulted when purchasing a radiant camp heater."
4,Buddy propane heater,Have used it a couple of times since the purchase and love it. Nice for tailgating!!
5,Great Portable Heater,"Using the throw away Propane bottles makes this a great portable heater. One bottle will heat on low for about five hours. You can also buy a hose to hook into a bigger Propane tank. The heater is lite, easy to ignite and easy to move. On a cold night in a tent or small camper this is a nice heater. Note: If using a hose to run this heater off a bigger tank of Propane I recommend using a fuel filter that can be purchased for this item. This keeps the heater from getting gummed up from unused propane left in the hose."
4,Soccer Dad's answer for Heat,This heater is the perfect answer to portable heat while attending daughter's soccer games! So easy to take along with the soccer blanket & chair & no worries for any hookups. Through all the wind & rain & cheering on the field line the heater provides warmth but only if you sit in your chair long enough with it beside you.
2,Buddy Heater,It is a nice size to carry around but it will not stay lit. I bought it to use at the ballfield but it doesn't work. I actually have intended to return it. I just haven't done it.Thanks
3,Reconditioned units,"I too received a reconditioned unit from Amazon and am sorely disappointed. So I can't comment on the quality of the item because I'm sending it back. (Had to give it something, so I gave it a 3.) I just wouldn't trust a heater, particularly one that burns propane, that had once been ""defective."" I've never had a problem with Amazon before. Why they are doing this without informing the purchaser is beyond me.(So much for staying warm on my camping trip this weekend.)"
1,"Good name, poor results","I purchased one of these units back in October for use in coastal Alabama where it doesn't get unbearably cold and despite following the iperating instructions to the T, I now have the same problems that many others have, the one with the oil leakage. Mr Heater's web page has a nice little ""contact us"" page that hasn't worked for me yet, there is no repair place within 60 miles from here, and based on the number of ""repeats"" this problem has, even after repairing/cleaning it up, it'd be more expensive than it's worth. I'd give a zero (0) star rating if I was able to, especially due to its cost. I depise flushing $100 (heater and hose) down the toilet. Mr Heater won't get any more of my hard earned money, that's for sure!"
4,NOT FOR HIGH ALTITUDE CAMPING,"The higher the altitude, the colder it often gets at night. The problem is the ""low oxygen"" safety system built into this heater. There is less oxygen at higher altitude and when I needed some heat above 11,000 feet, it wouldn't turn on. It seems to be a great heater other than this flaw. Mark"
4,Buddy Propane Heater,"Yeah, it gets cold in Hawaii too. (Down to mid-lower 40s at the higher elevations during the winter.) The Buddy Propane Heater takes some of the chill out of the early morning air while waiting for the coffee to brew. It's a portable space heater about the size of a small, FAT briefcase, easy to light, (nearly) odorless but this heater is only a little less expensive to run than an electric space heater if you don't have an inexpensive propane fuel source.... Definitely not for heating up a large area."
5,Highly Recommended,This heater is the best I have ever owned. It provides plenty of heat and is cheap to run costing less than 18 cents an hour using a 20lb cylinder (thats on low setting 4000 btu). I read conflicting reviews concerning wether or not a filter was needed. I would like to clear this up once and for all. The manufacture does recommend in the owners manual to use a filter when operating from a 20lb cylinder. The cost is 10 dollars and includes shipping. I have not ordered or used this filter so I cannot say how it operates. If there are any doubters you can download the owners manual right here at amazon.
4,"Mr Heater ""IT Works""","just got my Buddy, used it my garage with the 3"" by 3"" vent opening they suggest for Safety. It Works, & it does what it's supposed to do, take the chill out, I read ALL the Reviews, & they were helpfull. Be Carefull with Propane & use responsibly.GREAT Product! Gary P. NY"
3,"Good Product, I think",Haven't had a chance to use it though. Got it in case we lose power. Looks sturdy enough
1,Made in China,I own a Mr. Heater portable Buddy heater and it works very well. I wanted to buy another but when I turned around I saw it was made in China. I would never trust a product made in China which has a flame in my home. Also with my experiences with Chinese products it would be a waste of money. It would probably brake down just after the warranty ran out and they would expect you to go right out and buy another. I'll just save my money it's just not worth it. I hope they never sell another for ruining a good product.
2,NEVER USE IN HOME OR SMALL UNVENTED PLACE,"NEVER USE IN HOME OR SMALL UNVENTED PLACE- bought to help the old rv, but the Carbon Monoxide detector goes crazy!!!! BE CAREFUL---- buy it elsewhere---i am now an Amazon Hater- so get it elsewhere if you want it- my opinion"
1,Left out in the cold!,I purchased this product for a very small cabin upstate NY. It worked great the first time I used it. Then it never worked again. The pilot light would lite but it wouldn't stay on. I used the small propane bottles. Its very frustrating when its cold and this unit doesn't work. Not sure if it was too cold for the unit or what the issue was.
5,Mr. buddy heater,"The heater is a good value so far. Very cozy radiant heat, and even at the low setting my cat singed his tail when walking near it, so be careful of this if you have pets. I'd like to see it get better mileage from a 1 pound can of propane, but I do have the 20 pounder ready in case of emergencies."
3,Extension cable,This item I purchased to run a rca connector and have a headphone extension for my IPOD to the reciever. I bought 2 and I use them every day. I am satisfied with the product.
5,Ear phone extension,This is exactly what I was looking for. The price was less than I expected to pay and quick delivery made the transaction easy.
1,Should not be sold through amazon,"Two major problems. The female end would not accept my Koss earphones but would accept my cheap sony earphones. They both have the same 3.5mm male. Additionally, one earphone channel now cuts out. The earphones work fine with every other jack. Don't order this!"
1,Only worked for about 2 months,"I got this headphone extension in the middle of July and now in early October it's broken. A day ago, the sound from my headphones began to fade out when the cord was moved. Now there is no sound from the right side of my headphones. At first I thought it was a problem with my headphones, but I plugged in my backup pair and both ear phones would only work if the extension cord lay a certain way. Then I plugged my main headphones directly into the audio plug on my PC sans extension cord and they work just fine so I'm positive that this cord is the problem.Extension cords are simple things with a simple purpose. There is no excuse for this not to work when taken care of and mine has been taken care of. I'm going to look for a better headphone extension cord that costs a few dollars more and is from a trusted brand. I recommend you do the same."
4,Urban Tale: Urban Tale,"Urban Tale's first album is an AOR-classic. Lots of hooks and beautiful melodies and still enough hard rocking edge. The only thing that bothers me is that big breaktrough never came for the band and though the band still exists, they are relatively inactive."
3,EXCELLENT DEBUT ALBUM,"Inspired by Journey, Toto or also Europe this nordic band shows a great music."
5,All you need to know-well almost,"I bought this book because a lot of people were saying how good it was. They were not wrong. I have several books on portraiture but this is one of the best I have. It covers a lot of ground without going into to much about materials etc,which if you are buying this book you should have a fair knowlege of already.It covers lighting and posing your models, which a lot of books dont. The demostrations are also useful and well presented. My only gripe is that I would liked to have seen a little more about the application of the pastels and a bit more on blending and working the pastel.I know this is difficult in a book so would welcome a DVD to accompany it."
5,Best of show!,"I have over a dozen different webcams, including Logitech, I-Bot, Pyro, Creative Labs, and several others. The Unibrain camera is by far and away the best of all of them, and I now own four of them. Unlike the one-star review, I found setup and function of all four cameras to be trivial, the cables worked great, and I can clip it pretty much wherever I need a camera. The clip also doubles as a simple stand, similar to the stand on the back of picture frames.Combined with firewire repeaters, they make excellent security cameras.I just wish someone made a camera with 1394B 800MB+ speed capabilities.... I wouldn't be surprized to see Unibrain one of the first to have one."
3,Wish I would have tried it out first,"I got this guitar and was happy at first, but the Applause logo is like a temporary tattoo. It's rubbing off after having it for two weeks! Come on! Seriously? I have a 20 dollar acoustic guitar at home that I've had for like ten years that is holding up better than this guitar. And it slips off my lap way too easily. It sounds great, I will give it that much"
2,Wrong Color,"I was anticipating the guitar to be the color that was posted on your web site, (Redish color) instead I received an all black color guitar. I am disappointed."
3,Ovation Super Shallow Guitar,It is 2 months since I purchase the guitar online and I still have not receive it... Will I get another one sent to me but this time with an International Tracking Number?
5,Awesome Guitar,I have been playing for 25 years and when I bought this guitar I thought it would just be an OK guitar but I was shocked at the tone that came from this guitar. I found the guitar easy to play minus the round bowl on the back making it slip off my knee which is easily fixed with a strap. I loved this guitar so much that I am a Ovation fan for life.
5,Good sound. Decent pickup. Great feel. Fantastic price.,"I picked one of these up at a local Sam Ash for $200. Well worth the money.The shallow body is nice.It could sound better, but that's why they make $600+ guitars.If you want something good to learn on, buy this."
4,Cool cheap guitar,I needed a cheap acoustic/electric guitar and this fit the bill. I have not had a chance to plug it in yet but it was set up fairly decently straight out of the box and I was able to jam on it right away with a quick tuning. Great little guitar.
4,good yet confusing,"Almost everything about this guitar is great! i had bought a natural a while back, and I'm looking to buy another for my daughter. The color i had wanted was black, yet when i searched it the picture came up, and it was white. Why is that i cant find any in black, yet in the ruby red picture i see a white, natural, red, and black ones? Where are the black ones??????"
1,Very disappointed,"I am very disappointed. The guitar was packed with its strings tensioned and the top detachment partially from the guitar body.It is unusable until repaired.Update: It has been several days after writing and attach photographs to the seller (Amazon), and have not received any communication."
2,Not worth the savings!,"Ordered this from Amazon thinking I would save money because they had it for the lowest price anywhere. I would have rather paid the $40.00 that I saved to Guitar Center or Muscians Friend because I had to return it as soon as I got it. The guitar was defective. It wasn't setup properly, intonation? ( there was no intonation ), action was too high. It wasn't playable in it's received condition. I would have had to bring it to a guitar shop for a setup which would have cost $60.00. Sorry Amazon, I really do like your services but is there any way for your company to check things before they're shipped. It could avoid hard feelings."
3,viewfinder is so small,Very durable plastic periscope. Should fit nicely on our wooden swingset/fort. I just wish the viewfinder wasn't so small. And I mean small. Looking in it is about as big as a dime. The kids will love it and can use their imagination but how hard is it to get a little magnification in there. I wouldn't mind even just two mirrors with a clear site. Fits the bill for the price.
2,More like a water catcher then a periscope,"The kids liked it for a little while but being in the sun quickly broke the plastic down and now every time it rains it fills with water, very disappointed it barely lasted 1 summer. Seems like almost all toys these days are made very poorly bad quality."
4,Good Adaptation,"I really like this seris of Shakespeare's work. If you read the original and then the new version, you get a feeling of his beutiful peotry while still being able to follow the story. My 10 year old brother reads it and has no problems with it what so ever."
3,Not what expected,"It's an okay game, but I'd recommend it for gamers who are 10 and under. The graphics are pretty good for GBC and the gameplay doesn't have any big flaws. I really enjoyed seeing the Lego world on my gameboy. The only major thing I didn't like about the game is the ending. When I got there, I didn't even know that I was finished and it only took me an hour or less. I'd recommend buying the original LEGO Island for PC, because it is more in-depth and has lots of modes of transportation. For example, you can ride a motorcycle, a bike, an ambulance, a jetski and more. The only two flaws are that you can't walk outside the paths/roads and you don't really get to fly the chopper. You should get the LEGO Island PC version for kids 7-13 and Lego island gamboy if it's for a 6-10 year old."
5,Lego Island 2,This is a great game for all ages.The graphics are pretty good.I think if you like legos you would probably like this game.You are a Pizza boy in the game.You throw pizza's at bricksterbots and other things.This game is worth the money!!
3,Not sure if it was worth the effort...,"It is a great game, the graphics are incredible and my son really likes it, HOWEVER, it took me 3 weeks to install -- and I'm pretty good with computers! The system requirements also seem VERY high, so be sure your computer can run this game."
3,"OK, but....",For some reason this did not lock into my receptacle . I don't know if the receptacle is a little off or the product is just not quite right. Other things plugged in to this receptacle just fine.
2,not real saffron,"HoneyCombs Saffron American Extract Alcohol Free (Liquid)Another person mentioned in his review that this product is not real saffron. I would like to thank him for pointing that out. I almost bought it under the pretense that it was ""real"". Back to the drawing board!"
2,Bought it for Mild Depression - Don't Notice Any Effect,I bought this because I read it helps with mild depression. Maybe whatever cause there is for MY mild depression isn't being addressed with this stuff and that's why it didn't work for ME. I'm finding better results with TURMERIC capsules and using organic Apple Cider Vinegar with meals.
3,Nice Lathe but I question the longevity of the Controls,Lathe is very nice and works very well. Fit and finish is good as well as ease of assembly. My concern is that the electronic speed control is mounted where two things can happen:Debris can damage it because of location if something comes off the lathe.Dust is going to keep the electronics coated continuously due to location and large vent holes in side of control.
1,Did not work right!,This player did not transfer songs or albums correctly from the start. it took out songs on it's own and wouldn't let me put them back on. The player compleatly died after trying to transfer some songs to the player. It will not power on now what ever I do. The quick power off was very annoying. Poor quality product.
3,Not Exactly What I Thought,"I got 2 of these for my kids' Christmas gifts. First of all, they work fine, but it's that they are smaller than they look in the pictures, a little hard to figure out how to operate--with no instructions or anything either--and I have yet to figure out how to get videos to play on them. I have converted several videos to MP4 format and tried to put them on my kids' players. Now, even though the computer says the videos are in the ""video"" folder on the player, I still get a ""empty disk"" message when I go to their videos on the player. Maybe I'll figure it out, but I kind of wish I had just gotten them a name brand mp3/video player."
3,Needs FW Improvements,"This product is nice and slim, plays well too. However, I have noticed some bugs with the FW, and some items that I have seen in other, equally priced players.While reading text files, at times the formating goes heywire and treats whole sections of text as a single line, that cannot be read.When going through directories/files, the selected directory does not scroll so that the entire title can be read.I live in a dry region. It seems that these players are sensitive to ESD. Luckily, the vendor (Pro_eb) did a wonderful job of replacing the one that was zapped.For the price, not bad, but could use improvements."
4,Love it,Super simple to use and small but not so small that it is annoying. There is also an accessory kit that you can get for itDurable Flexible Soft Black Silicone Skin Case with Belt Clip and Armband for...that is really cheap if you are like me and keep breaking your charger.
5,Stunningly Well Done!,"Frederick R. Newman more than earned my respect with this masterpiece. His abilities to do these incredible sounds are, in my opinion, only second to his uncanny knack for filling others in on just how to most easily do them! Way to go Freddy!"
3,Practice makes perfect,"Within 10 minutes of selecting three sounds that this book offers, I have been able to perform them based on the positioning of your tongue and mouth. The strategy to how to emulate the sound is demonstrated. What is difficult is taking the time to practice, which you can't fault the book. Not bad."
4,"Brief, but exquisite","This is the second MEC record I have bought (WCATB being the first). I'm already a huge fan. In my opinion, these guys deserve kudos equal to that which Will Oldham has enjoyed all these years. Except they are more consistent and have the decency to record their music in such a way that it is easy to hear, even on inferior equipment. Lo-fi schmo-fi. This is a superb companion to WCATB, which was one of my favourite LPs of 2006. If you're a fan of 'cosmic American music', I suggest you get into MEC pronto. They seem to tap into something which is entirely timeless, channelling The Band, Neil Young and the aforementioned Will Oldham in equal measures to provide a deeply satisfying listening experience that references nothing in modern music and is all the better for it. The only downside is this recording is a mere 28 minutes long. Hey dudes, how about a bit more content next time - they don't call it a Long Playing Album for nothing!"
1,Poor Writing Style Marred the Plot,"I found it difficult to overlook the substandard writing in this novella! The dialogue between the characters was ridiculous and terse. What little content existed was wasted on weak character development. I cannot believe this made it past an editor's chopping block!!!!!If you cherish beautifully written prose and prefer the paranormal, try reading one of Alice Hoffman's (she is the author of Practical Magic)."
3,Hilarante película,"Es un encanto de historia, los personajes, la historia, el humos todo es insuperable.Lo malo de esta versión son los subtítulos en inglés, lamentablemente no se pueden ocultar, y el sonido un poco bajo de calidad."
5,very funny,"This movie is very good you must see it right now,go and buy one and enjoy every minute of it.Very creative and funny."
3,Odd but enjoyable animated film,"Watch this after the kiddies are in bed. The plot is strange. Vampires in America (Chicago) and Europe (Düsseldorf) try to gain control over a product that can allow vampires to be out in the sun. The vampires are like old time gangsters. And the war zone is in Havana where the product was made. The professor who made it has a nephew he experimented on who doesn't know yet that he is a vampire. He becomes front and center in the struggle of control of the product. His uncle wanted all the vampires to have the potion free.The music is fun. Latin and Bop jazz. The animation reminds me a little bit of ""Yellow Submarine"" but not psychedelic. It is in Spanish so if you don't like subtitles you won't enjoy this film."
1,Difficult to watch,"I kept hoping it would get better as it went along, that something would redeem it; no such luck. My copy was garbled and poor quality as well. It looked and sounded more like what I imagine a pirated film would, like a film of a film. Do not buy this. Really bad."
2,Not the Video advertised here,"Note that this is a video of an A&E documentary series on WWII, and NOT the movie (directed by David Prior) that Amazon says it is."
1,Terrible book,"I am really shocked to see such great reviews on this book. It is dry and extremely repetitive. The examples are uninteresting and too simple and obvious to add any depth to the topic, and are therefore a waste of paper and of time spent reading them. There is a section that is actually titled ""The Compleat Upper Manager."" Compleat? That doesn't even seem like a typo; it seems like a misspelling."
4,memories,"have wanted to find a copy of the tape for a long time, mine was stolen years ago. it was the very first tape I ever owned and it reminds me of simpler times. Very pleased and surprised to find one still factory sealed. just hope my player doesn't eat it. I seem to remember the first song having words though and not being just instrumental. also the cover art is different than the one posted, the one I received has gold decorations and the words ""Season's Greetings"" on the front."
5,HP everyday photo paper,"This paper is excellent for making CD jewel box rear covers & DVD covers. It isn't as thick as regular Photo Paper, which makes it very hard to close a DVD box and also makes it very difficult to put into the back of a CD box. This paper is thin enough to allow the DVD box to close completely and easily. The image quality is excellent. The drying time for the ink is slow, but I find that letting it sit a couple of days does the trick."
5,Beautiful,"This film is moving, strong, pure, and there are so many other things I could say about it, I'll have to stop now. Farnsworth gives a touching and real performance matched by Spacek at her best. David Lynch keeps surprising, and shows he can do anything he sets his mind to."
5,The Straight Story,Excellent movie. Lower your wall of cynicism and see the meaning. Richard Farnsworth was an amazing actor.
4,Good Film for all,"The film is a real look at what it is like in middle america. The People more than anything want to succeed, and they will do whatever it takes to make it to their goal. The Main Charactrer goes through anything that he can to get to see his brother. It causes you to look back at your life and see if you are working hard to do things you need to or if you are blowing them off. I am giving it 4 stars only because there is a ton of slow moving scenes in the film, but otherwise it is great."
5,"A film for the ages. Not too poetic, Not too emotional, But real in it's simplicity",Alvin Straight doesn't offer mind boggling advice nor does he claim to possess a mystical knowledge of people's emotions. Instead he spends the trip reflecting on his own life that's near end. He learns things about himself but most importantly learns one ultimate truth: Sometimes your family is all you have and you must treasure them. Along the way he meets other regular people and gives some fatherly advice but also is equally affected by them as well.You can't go wrong with this picture. Enjoy it
1,boring waste of time,this is the most boring slow moving movie i've ever watched. it's like if i was watching paint drying or grass growing for 2 hours! avoid like the plauge!
1,Don't waste your time,"Quite simply, this was the worst movie I have ever seen. This guy decides to ride his lawnmower half way across the country to see his long lost brother. Good for him. I wouldn't do it, and did not appreciate being along for the ride in this awful movie.For some background info, I am not a David Lynch fan. I enjoyed Blue Velvet, but have pretty much hated everything else by him. But this is the worst."
1,Boring... These other reviewers are nuts!,"The Straight Story is horribly boring. Nothing of note happens in the entire film. The people that have given this four and five stars must be crazy. You will be very disappointed if you watch this film ""The Straight Story"". There are some nice views of Iowa in the film, and if that's all you expect you may be satisfied. If you want to see a plot or story line you will be disappointed. All you will to see is character development with nothing ever happening. The retarded daughter(Sissy Spacek) is totally pointless btw. Anyway, don't say I didn't warn you!"
5,What do you mean you have never heard of this movie??,I cannot believe how many people have never heard of this movie. Don't let that be you! A true masterpiece!
4,The Straight Story,I purchased The Straight Story VHS tape and am very satisfied. Have always liked the film and was glad to find the VHS tape for sale.
5,Brief But Honest Review,"Excellent, excellent, excellent!!! For all brothers who have gone there separate ways due to unforgiveness or self interest or just a game really need to watch this movie. It dissolves the harden heart and brings reality into focus again. It's a simple movie but one you will not forget especially when the two brothers at the end the movie look up into the sky and wonder at stars above. Unforgettable! Included in my collection."
4,The Straight Story,"I had been looking for this movie for about 12 years. I had seen a preview and never saw the movie available to rent, I didn't remember the name or the star's name. A month ago I saw a movie with this star and was able to find the movie thanks to amazon. The movie is good and worth seeing. I think with a little better writing it could have been great"
5,Alvin Straight made me want to be a better person!,"I have never seen a film that captured it's audience so fully and completely. When movies end and the credits begin, what happens? People get up and leave. Sure a few people will stay behind and read the credits.... But when I had the honor of seeing The Straight Story, noone stirred. Noone moved. It was as if we all waited, hoping to get one last glimpse of this beautifully simple and honest man. It was as if we stayed to hear the beautiful score for one more second, the story would be retold and our lives would be sweet again. This film is simply glorious."
5,"Fabulous, Fabulous","I must admit, when I heard the premise for this film--David Lynch does a movie about a guy who drives a lawnmower hundreds of miles to visit sick brother, I thought, ""I don't know."" However, this movie is just terrific. David Lynch still has the knack for catching the weirdness of life on film, it's just that in the Straight Story, he does it in a non-shocking way. The cinematography is wonderful, as you would expect with a Lynch film and the acting is particularly strong. These actors are not beautiful Hollywood stars, but average looking people with lots of talent. The story, as Lynch tells it is heartwarming without being hokey at all, it's funny, yet remains true to the story. Richard Farnsworth is a masterful actor who with one single silent expression can convey a wealth of emotion.See this movie now, you won't regret it. Highly recommended."
5,Richard Farnsworth,"My husband and I accidently found this movie on the teevee one night when we were eating dinner, I said, ""Stop!"", because I love Richard Farnsworth, as an actor and as a man (think BIG Time Crush).This movie is wonderful, but what is even more amazing is that he had terminal cancer and was in great pain when he made this film. It was Very Important to him that this film be made...After the film was finished, he killed himself because of the unendurable pain from his incurable cancer. He was a man of courage and legacy.I hold candle and prayers for him and for his wife, and this movie that is the last part of his legacy as a heartfelt actor."
4,The straight story,"A well balanced film of Lynch, who is prone to excess sometimes though a brilliant director. This is a simple story about a man who goes to see his brother with a farm tractor."
4,STRAIGHT STORY,PRICE WAS RIGHT -- SHIPMENT WAS FINE - ACTUAL STORY WAS GREAT IT STARTED IN A TOWN IN IOWA THAT IS A PART OF OUR FAMILY HISTORY!!!
5,Good story about a simple act,"This movie, ""The Straight Story,"" directed by David Lynch and starring Sissy Spacek and the late Richard Farnsworth is a satisfyingly good story about a trip of several hundred miles that a man from Iowa made on a lawn mower to see his ill brother in an adjoining state. It chronicles the trials and tribulation that he encountered on that trip as well as the good things that happened to him along the way. It is an excellent movie that is suitable for the entire family that would appreciate a simple true story about perseverence and love. I recommend it highly. The actor Farnsworth, who has acted in many movies, died of cancer shortly after completing this movie. It is said that he endured considerable pain during the making of the movie but continued on despite his discomfort."
2,Still Trying to Watch This Movie,"I tried to watch The Straight Story last night, but had to give up after a while because Sissy Spacek was driving me up the wall. What an overdone, annoying performance. But I'm going to give it another try tonight, because Richard Farnsworth is so good. Also, I'm encouraged by the fact that one viewer who's seen it all the way through said that Spacek is out of the movie after the first half hour. By the way, another viewer stated that this was Farnsworth's first lead role. Doesn't anyone remember 1982's The Grey Fox? A terrific movie!"
2,Very Slow-paced Film,"I am a big movie fan, especially of independent and foreign films. I almost always enjoy films that are NOT big budget Hollywood releases. In fact, I have never written a negative film review for an independent film before.However, I thought this film was very slow, and to be blunt, quite boring. It's one of those movies where you wonder when it's going to pick up. But I feel it never does.It does have a nice story line. And I think my Grandma would enjoy it, because it's nice and simple, and not too fast. I didn't find anything original in it, though. And there were no unexpected twists or turns in the story.As an odd sidenote: An odd thing I noticed is the prominent presence of cigarette smoking, which seemed out of place in many scenes. I bet (a) cigarette firm(s) paid for product placement."
2,Sleep Well,"it is conceivable that you will like this movie, though the only way i can imagine that happening is if you a) love lynch; b) are prepared to love anything he puts out; and c) know ahead of time that this is a lynch movie. besides that, i found very little redemption in this movie, after seeing all the rave reviews. Sissy is good, yes, but she plays a marginal role--generally we see the road, the man, and his machine. with background music of course, which dominates the entire film--largely because nothing else is going on. the dialogue seems trite, sometimes beyond corny, and the best thing about the movie is that the long lost brother ends up being stanton. besides that, if you are prepared for a movie in which 2/3's of your time will be spent looking at the broken yellow lines of the highway, as well as a man sitting on a lawn mower looking straight ahead, then you at least know what's in store."
3,GREAT MOVIE!!,This gets my vote for one of the best Movies. BUT I give the movie 3 stars like someone else I saw. simply because of the DVD.It's SO DAMN exspensive and it still has some of the sound problems that the VHS had! I was hoping that the sound would have been cleared up from the vhs but no it hasn't.THIS IS A FANTASTIC film. BUt they could have had at least a little documentry about the real Alvin StreaightThey could have had some bio's or making of. or just took some pictures of where they shot. I respect Lynches reason for not putting a chapter skip but c'mon! He just could have put more to the dvd! This film needs to be put under the 100 best movies though. and the only reason I can say to buy the dvd is to have a widescreen version of the film.. but other then that I guess you really should go get vhs.
1,Disappointing content,I saw this Movie on Television when it first aired and I loved it. I vowed then to someday own a copy of it. Well... now I do...and it is a crime what someone did to it! scenes have been cut from it and the long distance scenes have had the sound butchered from them so that you cannot hear what is said. I expected to get a copy of the original...UNCUT movie... but that is not what I received... the movie I received...I could have gotten off the $5 rack at Walmart! MOST DISAPPOINTING!
1,The Straight Story,"Straight Story (Ws)Ordered the medium priced copy and received a severely edited 'version' which raped the original film footage and story. There can be no such thing as a 'version'.You gave the impression of selling the original.The $15 lost was bad enough. Watching a 'clipped' version is what really hurt.Screw me once, your fault. Screw me twice, my fault.It will not happen."
5,Very good,I believe this is one of the best films I have seen in years. At first I thought it was a little slow. Then I got in to it and got hooked. It was awesome when I found out it was a true story.How does the Academy Awards miss stuff like this?
5,One Sweet Cart,"I found the wagon cart on carts and wagons for $209 ( don't know if is still on sale) and it has worked very well. I bought the bike attachment through amazon and it has been great for carrying things on the bike, ie dog, cooler and tools. This is such a great deal from a manufacturer that builds these up in Spokane Washington! Try to find a wheelbarrow that is made in the us any more."
5,Avedon - DVD.,"There is no way anyone who loves ""light"" and phtography can''t take the time to view and study this Icon's approach to subject, light, and composition.A master of imaging, never reducing his subjects to just people per se. Fashion without the ""sexuality"". All his work is starkly subtle and beautiful.Raymond Barron"
3,avedon's style now being copied,"it is a fairly decent length of video. avedon's style is basically black and white for portraiture and there is no big secret to his style because all you have to do is bracket your shots then choose which one attracts you more then frame it, that's all. i was impressed only of his fashion photography wherein he ""invented"" the ""action"" photography which he pioneered which is being copied nowadays by fashion photographers. but currently i think annie liebowitz is giving avedon a run for his creativity. one of avedon's great photographs i admired was that of the beatles psychedelic portrait, that is awesome. i did not like avedon's taking photos of his dying father, i do not like remembering my dying father in photographs, i would prefer remembering him in happier times."
3,A bit overpriced,"This item was ok, really not worth the money. The green fabric on top was sloppily glued on, and the black locking tabs do not work so well. Plus the packaging was the worst I have ever seen (and this wasn't even included in the free super-saver shipping!). I think there are better options out there."
4,washer toss,"This is the same type of game as Lukes except Lukes makers are no longer in business. It's a shame cause Lukes was made much, much nicer with attention to quality. This game functions the same in the game play, but the plastic housing is so lite that is moves around when the washers make contact with it. plus getting them out of the holes is a pain. Other than that, game play is fun."
5,Supermat 50 X 60 Gym mat,"I purchased this mat for a home gym to sit atop, it fit nicely, is heavy duty and holds the weight of the user and the machine without any problem. On carpet I put 3/4"" plywood underneath and layed the mat on top then put the weight machine...It is perfect and super duty as it claims. 5 Stars for this product."
4,Good Basic Mat,Not overly thick but thick enough to set a stationary bike or home gym (what I used it for).
5,Exactly as described,"This is the second mat I have purchased. It is exactly as advertised. My exercise equipment sits on it level with no sliding, while protecting my floor."
4,Great Chair Mat,"I was looking for a rubber mat to replace the typical floor mat at my desk. My mat became electro-charged over the winter, so I wanted to replace it with rubber. Those static-free mats are very expensive. At first it slid around on the carpet, but two strips of double-sided tape stopped that...so far so good...but I will not know until winter if my BIG problem is solved."
2,Denmark vs China,"I am an assistant scoutmaster and an Eagle Scout. I have sawn a lot of wood with a bow saw. I have a used Fiskars made in Denmark blade. It cuts about 30-50 % better than a new Fiskars blade made in CHina. I tested both blades against the same tree within 5 minutes. If I had known that they were going to make crappy blades in China, I would have bought 30 Denmark blades the last time I saw them. That said, this is a fair blade with smaller teeth(clogs easier and cheaper to manufacture.)"
4,"Good replacement blade, take care of it and it should last.","This is a replacement for an old, rusty saw blade that no longer cut through those christmas trees very well. Put this new fiskar blade on and cut through it very effectively. Simply add a coat of oil or WD-40 after using it to store it and it should last as long as the sharp teeth do. Very simple maintenance for a simple tool!"
3,Strict Tempo,I'm a beginner dancer and I like this CD for it's strict tempo. The singers are not so great but that really doesn't matter in this particular instance. I bought the CD for the basic foxtrot beat and that's what it gives.
4,Nice CD!,"I enjoy this CD a lot. I found some of the cuts a bit long, and I wish the father/son combo had appeared on more of the songs, because they sound great together. As it is, Dennis gets away from what he does best: simple but beautiful traditional melodies and his own songs. I didn't care much for the ""Around the World in 80 Days"" cut.. just doesn't fit somehow. All in all, an enjoyable CD though... well worth owning."
5,More Kamakahi excellence!,"Dennis Kamakahi is both a talented Hawaiian slack key guitarist and a prolific songwriter, joined here by his son, David (Kawika), displaying his own talents on the `ukulele. This recording gives the listener tracks of solo guitar, solo `ukulele (some instrumental-only; some with vocals), as well as `ukulele/guitar duets. A definite ""must have"" for fans of traditional Hawaiian music."
5,Brilliant Hawaiian Master,"I was first introduced to Dennis Kamakahi as he toured with Led Kapana and Cyril Pahinui on the 2006 Hawaiian Slack Key Masters Tour. I was immediately struck by his superb vocals. This album does not disappoint!!Playing with his son, he showcases his exquisite song writing in his own voice, which is certainly in the same league with Keola Beamer, Kei'eli Reichel and Pahlani Vaughn. In addition he explains the music between songs, giving those not so familar with Hawaiian language, music and culture a basic framework in which to listen. One need not be a fan of Hawaiian music to enjoy this disk; if you are. it is a must-have for your collection."
1,Ohana,"All the reviewers so far must have been relatives of Ohana,George Winston piano version of ""Ike ai Ladana"" was outstanding.I was disappointed in Ohana's for I know a guitar would havesounded great for this song,but Ohana was a 0 star."
1,Neither fun nor interesting,"I was hoping to spice up my course in Markting a bit with a pictoral guide, but the pictures are very diappointing. They are not funny at all and even not fine drawn. Since Kotler is very easy to read, who would need such a lame and ugly picture story?"
3,Sacred Energy,"Explores the ""earth energy"" at sacred sites with input from a healer, a psychic, and experts on quantum physics and earth sciences. There is much discussion of ""dowsing"" a practice I never heard of, which is apparently a way to spiritually divine the presence of water as well as other earth energies. Hamish Miller's story is further recounted in the DVD The Parallel Community."
4,Planet energy,"Ever heard of ""earth energy"" or ""dowsing?"" If so, this will give you feedback from some experts in the field, including a healer, a psychic, and experts on quantum physics and earth sciences. If this is new to you, it will be a most credible introduction through a tour of sacred sites."
4,dowsing,"Miller does a lot of dowsing, which I've always found fascinating...he explores earth's energy, & it is explained that ancient civilizations were aware of what is only now being found to be true. It is amazing to me how advanced we could be by now if only we had taken these ancient ""beliefs"" seriously."
1,This record sucks,"Reviewer from Germany is right. I heard this remix of Heroes and its an insult. Don't know what that other guy is talking about by saying it reminds him of when Bowie fans hated him when he stopped being Ziggy. Whats that got to do with reviewing this record?! The fact is this version stinks. There are far better remixes out there. By the way I love Bowie. Always have, always will. Doesn't mean I have to like everything he releases though, right?"
5,"A Challenging, Moving, Thought-Provoking True Story","I bought this DVD after searching on-line for an input for a day of retreat for a group of ""associates"", women and men who share the spirituality and mission of our religious community, and some religious sisters who were drawn to the title, ""Peace One Day,"" All were deeply moved by the story of one person trying to make a difference, a real peace-maker. All were surprised that we had not heard about this in the U.S. media. Several individuals plan to gather small groups of neighbors and friends to show this in their own homes. The fact that the day of this retreat was right after the starting this year of the UN General Assembly and the anniversary of 9/11 added to the impact. It was a very well made video."
1,I hate to do this but...,The reason for one star is that this is a randomly abbreviated version of what used to be available on 14-hour VHS series. The tapes showed all the lectures in their entirety - on this DVD we get odd selections here and there intertwined with comments read by Susan Sarandon seated on an uncomfortable sofa. This set omits _all_ the lectures on Western mythology.
3,Perfect except for narration,"I enjoyed hearing Joseph Campbell. As always, he is clear, easy to follow and enlightening. Based on his segments alone, the project would easily be a 5 star experience. I did not enjoy the patronizing, condensending narration by Susan Saradon. It is great that Ms. Saradon backed the filming or whatever, but we poor stupid unwashed masses do not need smug, self-righteous Susan explaining to us what her good buddy ""Joe"" just said. Obviously, the average viewer is not clever enough to understand ""Joe"" as well as a celebrity. Thank goodness Susan is there to tell us what to think! The narrations sully the whole project. If it were not on DVD where the offensive Susan Saradon segments can be easily skipped, I could not recommend this at all."
5,Excellent purchase,"I bought this very comprehensive DVD set (3 discs) used and am very pleased, by the product and by the supplier. The set seems to include all the talks (subjects) Campbell made in his latest years.Joseph Campbell: Mythos 3It supplies about 10 hours of lectures, well presented."
5,very real looking mask,very good costume but the mask dose not fit well. when I put it on her head she cant see out of the eyes.
2,don't even think twice...,"Pokemon is the greatest show ever. It can teach us sime valuable life lessons, such as who to trust. However, if you want Pokemon DVDs, you should not get this one. The 3rd season episodes all have the same plot, and ""Forest Grumps"" is one of the worst Pokemon episodes ever. I suggest buying DVDs from the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th seasons, but NOT the third season. This DVD gets 1 extra star for ""Fowl Play"", which is one of the only decent episodes in the 3rd season, but ""Love, Totodile Style and ""Forest Grumps"" are not worth it. If you insist on getting 3rd season episodes, get the Gym ones and ""Midnight Heroes""."
2,Hopefully police and feds will read this book,It will show them how to keep an eye out for these types of cons so that they will not fall for them.
4,"I like the other books in that series more, but it isn't bad","The book before that (A wizard of earth sea) as far better. right now i am reading the last book in that series, and i like that one better, but this book is really good too."
3,What I thought about this book,"I thought this book could of been better, but there were some highlights in the book that were interesting to read.But overall this book was not very interesting to read."
3,What I thought about the tombs of Atuan,I thought the book was boring in some spot and enertaing at others but overall it was a good book.
2,Boring.,I was neither interested in the characters or the story. It was very very short and anti-climatic. Nothing special here.
1,A huge letdown to a somewhat promising series,"After reading Wizard of Earthsea, I was interested enough to continue with the second book in the series, but just barely. My hat goes off to anyone who can get through this short, yet mind-numbing book. I see now why it took LeGuin so long to get her first novel published. Her endless, run-on sentences are often totally devoid of any real meaning or interest, and leave you only with pain and regret for having invested time in this series. Do yourself a favor and cut your losses by not starting this second installment.Try George R. R. Martin's ""Game of Thrones"" or Julian May's outstanding Saga of Pliocene Exile for some truly rewarding reading in this field."
4,Good things come in.....,"In a genre dominated by 800+ page tomes, this book was a refreshing and delightful read. Ursula Le Guin is a master of flowing, lyrical prose. The book is relatively brief, but chock full of all the elements that are required for a great fantasy story. She accomplishes this feat by keeping things simple and uncluttered. She doesn't need an appendix to list all the characters and their relation to one another. Her world is well-realized, her characters well-fleshed out, and the story captures you from the first pages. Take a break from the massive tales of Jordan and Martin et al. (not that there's anything wrong with them) and read an author whose writing is as magical as her story."
3,"Probably the best of the series,","but that's not saying much. Of course this series isn't Tolkien caliber, because there's no such thing as Tolkien caliber. The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion are in a class by themselves. The Earthsea series reminds me more of the Riddle of Stars by Patricia McKillip, but it isn't as good as that."
3,Not Excellent,Well I'm now two books into Earthsea and I still can't understand why it's considered a classic. The story moves slowly. There's not a lot of beautiful prose or descriptive detail. Much of the action is expository. I'll keep reading but it's not classic.
2,tombs of atuan: not as good as expected,"The Tombs of Atuan was not as interesting as I expected it to be.I wanted a good, exciting, action-packed book, and the second book of the Earthsea Cycle trilogy didn't do that for me.it was exciting at places, such as in the labrynth maze. but all in all, i wasn't impressed.the story line was great, fresh, and original, but Ms. Le Guin could've presented it in a better form. the order in which the events happened wasn't exciting. it wasnt like a book that i couldnt put down, such as the Pendragon series kind of realistic fantasy. i read the wrong book."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The sequel to A Wizard of Earthsea is a little disappointing after the first book, and changes fairly significantly.It shifts focus from the mature wizard Ged, to a young woman. She is a member of a matriarchal cult, and they end up trapping and imprisoning Ged after he comes there on a mission.She has to come to realise what is more important."
4,Fantasy and Fairy Tale,"What a nice book! The story of how Tenar/Arha comes to serve the ghastly Nameless Ones and how she is liberated from this by Ged is told with a directness and economy which should be the envy of many writers. I found this story touching, poignant, and moving, and although some might say it is written for young adults it seems to me to be one of those fine books which--like Winnie-the-Pooh--appeals to all ages.And, in this day of fantasy novels which threaten one with a hernia if one picks them up, and with terminal boredom if one reads them, and which often contain nauseating things, how refreshing to discover a story 146 pages long which is suitable for all ages yet is not merely a children's story, and which deals with important issues like guilt, remorse, forgiveness, and the meaning of freedom."
3,"Not as good as the first book,but good at the end .",Le Guin put to much detail into the religon .She also made it boring.But the end was good.
3,a bald spot in a grassy plain.,"i still have not read tehanu so this review will refer only to the first three books. being a GREAT fan of tolkien, dragonlance and fantasy in general, icame upon the earthsea series with great joy. after reading the wizard of earthsea and the furthest shore i found the tombs of atuan somehow more boring, discussing too much of tenar's dark and uneventfull years and coming too late to the part where her adventures begun. ged, who was the hero of the first book and is as i think the most interesting chracter of this one, is being discussed as a secondary character. the book also leaves too many wide spaces open and the end is left unmended. i thing you can realy call the tombs of atuan ""a bold spot"" in the flowing spring of the earthsea series.it could have got another star but because the main storyline begun so late, the book was way too short."
5,More tightly plotted than its predecessor,"I have read the Tombs of Atuan numerous times. It holds my attention because it is so well written in terms of plotting and characters. A Wizard of Earthsea loses out to this second book of the trilogy in both these areas. The third book is hardly worth mentioning. All three books are very effective in creating a world complete in itself, with different races and cultures. It's useful to remember that LeGuin's point of view is anthropological, as she is the daughter of two noted anthropologists, Arthur Kroeber (after whom Kroeber Hall at Cal Berkeley was named) and Theodora Kroeber, who wrote a wonderful book about Ishi, the last Yahi. Anyway, in my opinion, Ursula LeGuin's books are best appreciated as fictional ethnography."
5,The Little Sequel That Could,"An excellent continuation of the Earthsea epic, perhaps even outdoing the original. This second book provides a slower, more intimate tale that is very well developed. The only problem with this short read is that its over too soon."
1,looks good but doesnt work.,"got the sling shot in the mail, put it together and can't even hit the fence at 20 yards. requested a return and no responce. please do not purchase this item you will be disapointed.saunders wrist rocket pro - saunders archery co - 2042"
2,not something to carry around,"it's very long and bulky, i say it weight near a pound of PLASTIC!!! it's over 1 ft long. NOT something i want to be carrying around and the pocket for whatever you're shooting is made of plastic! the life of this piece of plastic crap wouldn't last 300 shots. Not recommend, get a steel frame old school sling and put the rubber on yourself!"
4,Works Well,"I like this new design. It is very accurate, but not as powerful as the original wrist rocket. I think it is overpriced."
1,Terrible set up instructions in package,The instructions in package actually show different model slingshot. A few rare photos are terribly technically written. Can't figure out where rubber bands come from when trying to shoot it. Probably descent product but terrible instructions. Not recommended.
1,broke on tenth shot sending left band back in my face ouch!!,the band holding arms seem ok till you get to the ends where the band is locked in place with the band holding clip snaps in thats where the problem is bad design and could cause eye loss as when mine failed it blew my eyeware off my head iam returning mine to saunders and will wait and see if they fix this.
