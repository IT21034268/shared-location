5,One of the best albums of 2004,"I love this album, i lesten to it all the time. Royce is a talented rapper and it's a shame he fell out with Em and Dre 'cuz with them he would've been one of the best now. But he still manages on his own and he come trough some hard times tryin to make it big, so he deserves some credit. He gets five stars from me.my fav. tracks:1 regardless (bit short but good)2 throw back (I like his flow)4 i promise (my Fav, good lyrics)7 hip hop (great beat)10 i & me (my second Fav. great beat and great lyrics)15 something's wrong with him (originlly Nas tune but he does a great job here)PeaceOUTLAW"
4,Good Album But Not GREAT,"I heard about Royce from one of my friends so I decided to cop his album. I don't feel that it is a GREAT album because it didn't grab my attention after the first time listening to it. I think any classic (such as Illmatic) should grab my attention the first run through but this one did not. However, Royce does bring on some hot ass tracks. ""Hip Hop"", ""I Promise"", ""TODAY"" are some of my favorites. The album's production is so-so. I was hoping for more Primo produced tracks but I only got one. I think Royce's production could be a bit better because some of the beats just sound too simple; not enough flavor. Lyrically, he's good but does not appear to be mature yet. You can definitely tell that Eminem bit Royce's style and delivery. If I had a chance to go buy the CD all over again, I probably would."
4,"Even with 4, it's the MOST HEART IN HIP-HOP TODAY!!!","I've been a fan of Royce for years, since I heard his song, ""King of Kings,"" an unreleased song from years ago telling the story of Jesus' life from the first person perspective. One of the top 5 story raps of all time! This album was a great refresher after the bitter taste left in my mouth from Rock City. This album proves what I've been telling cats for years: not only is he the only MC that can blaze Em on his own tracks, but he's got probably the most complex rhyme pattern in the game. The album has a couple of iffy spots, but all-in-all, his voice, delivery and the fact that he colaborated with producers that made music for him, not the charts, makes this MY MOST SATISFYING HIP-HOP PURCHASE SINCE ""REFLECTION ETERNAL"" 5 YEARS AGO!!!!"
4,GREAT!!w/some candor in his lyrics,"i never heard of royce da 5'9'' before but after i listened to some of the songs online,i feel in love w/him.his lyrics r powerful and honest that rlly shows some of the hardships he has gone thru.honestly i think hes better than eminem right now cuz his lyrics r better.the production of the album could be better,some of the beats r alittle off.but defitnely worth buyin the album!!!some of the highlights in the album r:Throwback-he raps bout fallin out w/dre and eminemHip hop-the beat on the track is wicked,he disses members of da band put together by p.didy and some of the crap in hip-hopGangsta-excellent track w/the lyrics ""rules and laws dont apply to me"" ringing in ur headT.O.D.A.Y-the background singin is nice w/the beats,he talks bout some of the hardships he had to faceDeath is certain pt.2-he questions god bout lettin his friend die"
3,sound alright to me,"royce 59 song hip hop is the main reason i got this album,plus that was my song of 2004!"
2,"Its ok, but definitely NOT better than Eminem","Alot of people mostly player hater type of people that hate on people at the top (eminem, 50 Cent, etc.) It is decent though but definitely not worth buying. Plus he kinds of comes off as a hypocrite like on the song beef, He says something like ""takes wallaces (BIG's) advice and not make beef tracks"" and yet on the same song he disses eminem. There are a few ok songs on here but the few people who rated this, have crossed their bounderies, they overrated this CD by far. The best song on here is ""Something's wrong with him"" I feel some of the stuff he is saying and the beat is real good too on that track."
4,The Best 5'9 Ever,"Wow my friend said royce was trash without Eminem And He Was Wrong. This Album Is Hot Especially Death Is Certain I just Love The Way its Rap Along With Beef, Today, Throwback and Promise those are some of the reason to get this album just those song well the whole cd basically"
4,4.5 Stars,"I Didn't really like Royce as an artist until I listened to Death Is Certain, this is one of the best albums I have ever heard and it is A MUST HAVE!!!Standout Tracks are: Regardless, Death Is Certain Pt. 2 & Hip Hop"
5,ITS ABOUT TIME,"i am so sick and tired of all that fake ""hip-hop"" garbage out there like eminem and gangsta rap like 50 cent its so old already, but finally in time of struggle there are always a few rappers who rep a real life and speak to real people and respect real hip-hop and royce sure shows that on this album, him and joe budden in my opinion are the only mainstream rappers keepin it real taday. ALL A YA'LL REAL HIP-HOP LOVERS CHEACK OUT ""TRIAL AND ERROR"" BY AN UNDERGROUND ARTIST CALLED CLASSAFIED HES AWSOME."
4,Great lyrics...so-so beats,"Royce da 5'9's latest cd suffers from the same affliction that has happened to the latest Dilated Peoples, Swollen Members, Styles of Beyond CD's. Great lyrics but average-to-weak production. I think Royce is one of the 4 or 5 best lyricists currently rapping in hip hop (no joke), but the beats don't serve him well. The beats are standard, violin & guitar cinematic-type beats you might hear on any G-Unit, 50 Cent, or Cormega CD."
5,A REAL Hip-Hop Album....only for the real Heads,"Lets keep it simple and short:-Royce's Skills are Certain.-Yes a lot of the beats are simplistic, but the samples are great. The beats fit his raw, honest and realistic lyrics.-If you like all the BS on the radio you may not be able to feel this album.-If you like artists like Nas, Mobb Deep, and Jadakiss, you need to add this to the collection.Whoever says Royce's lyrics have not matured must not have listened to them. He's not bragging on materialsm...he comes with RAW STREET WISDOM.The masses are SLEEPING ON THIS ALBUM!!!"
2,2.75 STARS,"This album is good, but certainly not great. The best songs are ""regardless"", ""throw back"" & ""hip hop"". The other songs are pretty average. This probably isn't worth getting, but if its cheap, GO FOR IT."
1,A Poor film in most Respects,This is a poor film. The filming is ameteurish and the story line is badly put together. I would not recommend this film.
5,essential reading for all therapists,"As a physical therapist I am thrilled to find a text that reflects the philosophy of my organisation. And the fact that it is written by a parent of a child who has a disability is even more exciting - someone who has expeience as a consumer of ""the system"" that insists on inflicting therapy sessions on kids, regardless of their needs.Snow's book is a breath of fresh air. The entire book is full of excellent comments and advice. It should be a compulsory text for all paediatric therapists, (not to mention teachers) whether they work in a clinical or school setting."
2,Naturally Common Sense,"I can honestly say that yours is the first book about disability issues that I just cannot put down. I have recommended it to several people and plan to order some of your materials to promote the theme. Thanks for writing the book and coining the phrase that will surely begin a revoluation to teach society, one person at a time, what we have always known: Disability IS Natural."
4,Satisfied with the product even though it took a long time to receive,"The CD was received in good condition and was adequately packaged. The price was also competitive. There were less expensive choices but so were the reviews. I banked my trust on the reviews. I would recommend buying CD's from this supplier (in the UK). The only drawback was it took quite a while to receive. However, I was warned, after I made the purchase, that the ship date would be several weeks. Overall, I am satisfied with the service and the product."
5,Good story,"I was pleasantly surprised by the book. I enjoyed learning about the history of an 800 year old war and how it affects those living under the stress of conflict. Add in the human interest that the author provides and it was a very enjoyable, defintely readable book. What I particularly enjoyed was how the author painted a very picturesque story of Northern Ireland and its citizens."
2,"Not for tall, wiggly toddlers","My daughter is not quite 2 1/2 years old, but is 37"" tall. I bought this and had it sent to my parents house for her to use when we visit there. Well, she barely fit on it and the side bumpers didn't hold he on when she shifted at night. I checked on her and she was half-off the thing. It was cute, but didn't quite work for us."
5,Dukes Back-Pack Great,My grandson son adores the Dukes of Hazzard. His first day back to school was a special time for him with his new Dukes of Hazzard back-pack. The quality of the back-pack is sturdy enugh to last a fourth grader the entire year. Thank you
2,cheaply made,This bag is not as vibrant as expected...lighter in Colorado than dukes of bazaars products. Fabric is also cheap looking with a harsh chemical smell.
5,Alright,Son has had it for two years and it's now beginning to fray. I think we paid way too much for it.
2,First Time Mom in WI,"These yoga DVDs are terrible. It reminded me of the birthing classes that you may see on some old sitcom. I was hoping for more relaxation and less instruction. (I admit to never watching the full set. I watched part of the first and second DVD.) The instructor gives you different positions to use and gives your coach instruction in how to prevent massage fatigue (use his elbow instead of his hand), but the class is so boring that it is hard to get through. Also, when you are actually in labor, you tell your husband to do what makes you feel better. You don't think to yourself, ""Gee I saw in a video once that rubbing my lower back will help the ache in my back."" Save your money. You can find better, more relaxing videos out there."
5,The Woody Allen you never knew,"This documentary actually comes in two parts. Both are excellent and highly recommended. Only Allen would hurry things along on the set in order to make it to a Knicks basketball game on time. If you're not ready to buy, but are still curious, you can rent the videos on iTunes for $4.00. They also have the bundle containing parts 1-2 for $15.00. Either way, these documentaries are well worth the time to absorb."
4,"I love the documentary, but I wish it had spanish subtitles","I love the documentary, but I wish it had spanish subtitles. I think its very complete because it introduces Woody Allens life, his personality and how all of this influence in his creativity process"
3,Sigh.,"I must say that the Thoroughbred series is becoming less and less well written. They are getting shorter and more predictable, and like a fellow reviewer mentioned, the cover art just plain sucks. It looks as though it was designed by someone with no knowledge whatsoever of horses. Galloping a horse in a halter. Riding on a saddle pad with no girth. I didn't find this book to be very enjoyable. Just reading the back of the book, it was clear who the stalker would be. There could at least have been some suspects. In fact, the sheer predictabiliy made me disappointed in Christina's intelligence. If I could figure it out, shouldn't she have been able to? Only my faith in the Thoroughbred series let me rate it 3 stars."
2,this book STINKS!!!,"THOROUGHBRED IS MY FAVORITE SERIES,BUT THEY ARE GETTING WORSE.CHRIS IS PARANOID,AND PARKER IS NEVER THERE.MELANIE IS ACTING STUPID AND ALL JAZZ DOES IS GO ON TOURS.I DONT KNOW WHY THEY ARE MAKING BRAD SO NICE, BUT THAT ISNT HIS CHARACTER.THE NEXT ONE SOUNDS MORE EXCITING.EVER HOPEFUL"
5,"The best Enviro-Techno album, bar none !",Environmental Techno at its best !!! A must buy for relaxation/ stimulation. Each track engulfs the senses and enlivens the spirit.
5,Cure for troublesome ears,"My five-year-old black labradoodle has long hanging ears and when she was a youngster her ears were damp and she developed a yeast infection with the associated brownish red residue, odor, etc. I worried that this would become a chronic condition as it had been with my last dog, leading to deafness, and repeated visits to the vet. I tried a natural remedy using vineger, I believe; however, it didn't seem to work and made a smelly mess. Soon thereafter I discovered Vet's Best Ear Relief Dry at Petco and applied it after cleaning her ears with a paper towel. I get her to lay on her side and I apply three drops or so into each ear. I also trim the hair in and around the base of her ears with a small electric clipper to promote better air circulation. I do this approximately once a week and it has worked like magic. Her ears are nice and dry and she hasn't had any ear problems in nearly five years. It also smells very nice."
2,Aesthetic dishonesty,"I am not a flamenco purist, but this flamenco-derived album seems dishonest to me. My first requirement for any of the music in my eclectic collection is Truth, from which beauty can grow. Without Truth there is only ""glamour"" - artifice rather than art. This music is the equivalent of the faux-jazz of Kenny G or the faux-soul of Michael Bolton. If you're looking for fine non-hardcore flamenco, I recommend Estrella Morente. She's extremely gifted, and her music is Truthful as well as beautiful."
3,About what I expected...,"I've read Benson's previous novelizations of ""Tommorrow Never Dies"", so I pretty much expected an accurate novelization of the screenplay and after seeing the movie that was pretty much what I got. It was nice the way Benson fleshed out the characters and filled in some of the blanks that would have come up if I had only seen the film. Unfortunately, some of the material doesn't translate well to the printed word. Many of Bond's double entendres fall flat as does some of the descriptions of sight gags. All in all a solid piece of work, but nothing that's gonna win a Pulitzer."
5,Approximately 1000% better than the movie,"Movie novelizations aren't really on my literary radar at all, unless they're James Bond movie tie-ins written by Raymond Benson. THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH book is much richer, nuanced and layered than the film.In the sense that Sean Connery IS James Bond then Raymond Benson IS Ian Fleming. He doesn't write like Fleming (could any writer duplicate Fleming's mid-20th Century snobby prose poetry?) but Benson's deft blending of Bond's literary progenitor and Bond of the movies is spot on, but more important, exciting and fun. Benson writes books I look forward to reading, even movie tie-ins originally plotted and scripted by others! In particular Benson makes the improbably stupid and foolhardy boat chase scene early in the movie into something a lot lower key and almost believable.My chomping at the bit to read a movie novelization is the highest compliment I can pay Raymond Benson."
5,Bond is back and Better Then Ever!,This is the Best book in the Bond collection. I found this book a real page turner. I loved the action scenes in the book because they were described so well. The best part of the book... for me was the begining when he raced the cigar girl through the Thames River in London. Raymond Benson Does a wonderful job of kepping the James Bond style after Fleming.I read this book foor Honors Geography at Redmond High School For Mrs. Nygaard who is a really cool teacher. -Ryan
2,Don't bother,"If some parts of the movie seemed far-fetched (how about the Cigar Girl escaping in a balloon? Wouldn't you go for a car! ) then in this novel they just seem ridiculous. The boat-chase scene does not translate well at all. However, it does have to be said that Benson succeeds where the film failed: in actually developing the characters so that they appear somewhat more than paper-thin."
1,Do not bother,"Okay 007 fans, this book was a waste of time. It was so bad, that I couldn't finish it. The boat chase at the start of the book did not translate will, nor did the mountain chase. The characters seemed flat and our beloved Bond was dull. Granted, this is just my opinion, but this is one book that can be skipped. See the movie. Mind you, I love Bond books, but this was one that can be passed on."
4,A good novelisation,"Being a Bond fan since I was a kid, I naturally can find little fault with Mr. Benson's novelisation of the screenplay. At least he attempts to flesh out the characters more than John Gardner ever did. Ian Fleming always made that extra effort in presenting the villain as a real person with a proper background, and Mr. Benson has retained that tradition. Though he has copied the dialogue faithfully from the screenplay, I can't help wondering how more excellent this book would have been had he created the situations and characters from scratch."
1,Spare Me,"Yet another watered-down Bond novel based upon a movie script that has little to do with Ian Fleming's original character.Without a doubt, the champaign corks must have immediately started popping in the halls of the Library of Congress once the release of this book was announced."
4,Real life western,"Kelton is the premier western fiction writer of our time. Slaughter is very historically accurate and a thrill to read. The ""Cowboys and Indians"" that so many of us played when we were children becomes real in this novel.The slaughter of the American Bison is a real tragedy of American history. Kelton describes the scene of the bison lying dead on the ground while skinners cut off their skins to sell. This book will make you think about the careful use of our natural resources instead of exploiting them to the fullest like the buffalo hunters did.A very good read. I highly recommend this book to all western fans."
4,Top 10 debuts of the year.,"...these guys do not disappoint. it may take a while to get used to it, and the rest of the cd is nothing like the single ""pitiful."" it is well worth the listen. it is unique, fresh, and risky, and they r still getting moderate airplay time for pitiful and ""Sleepwalking"" my 3 personal favorite songs are ""cute boring love"" ""caught a glimpse"" and ""thought like flames""B+/A-"
5,VERY GOOD CD!,This is a good cd with a good message. And people who rated this cd a 1 or 2 you guys are old because this is a cd for teens who likes the screaming and heavly guitar riffs.
2,Another bland paste,"Nothing really struck me on this album as original. Their musicianship wasn't terrible, just uninspired. I've heard the occasional screaming vocals before, and done better.While I continue to search for new music, I have encountered dozens of standard sounding rock bands that don't thrill me. Blindside is another of those bands. Nothing really inventive in each song. Verse/chorus/verse again. I have no idea how this band managed to open for Sepultura.My one word summary: BORING.More power to you if you don't think so."
3,I was in the mood for some hard and heavy music. This didn't end up satisfying.,"Blindside's polished metal with some touches of light screaming and growling here and there didn't impress. The screaming and growling will never impress me, turn me off actually if that's what the majority of an album or song is about. Here it is just punctuated in a few songs so its not overly burdensome. But the album failed to hook my ears or my head. A couple of moderately enjoyable songs as far as I am concerned but nothing special. As with all things some things need time to grow on a person or find a way to a person's passion. ""Silence"" has not done either of these things for me. But if you like modern hard music they sound like many others out there and you will probably like this okay."
5,lovvin it,"This cd is my new favourite cd. It's passionate, driven, upbeat, and just bloody good. The guys in the band are all great at their instruments, and it shows. The songs are complex and arranged uniquly, and the lead singer's voice (which is amazing) just tops it all off.The whole cd rocks my world, but my fav songs are #2, 'Pitiful', #7, 'Thought like Flames', and #13, the title song 'Silence'.go out and get yourself one!"
5,The best hard rock album this year!,"This album has everything hard rock lovers crave! If you see this reveiw and (without a doubt) love hard rock-BUY THIS ALBUM! You won't be dissapointed. I've heard alot of albums this year, this is the best one so far. There single PITIFUL is storming radio stations nationwide! These guys are big, But after this album there gonna be HUGE!"
5,simply wonderful,Raw emotion and Power with good production and pop rock sensability make this Their best work yet. This could be the best Rock album of the next year... Unfortunatly unless the evil empire (Mtv) does not embrace it none of the masses will ever be blessed by this great work.
4,Covered sugar dish,"While the sugar dish is just fine, I do have a problem with the fact that you have to buy the whole set (for about $40) when just the cover is broken."
2,A disappointing coffee table book,"With its grandiose title one might expect this to be a sweeping study of intelligence during the second world war - sadly it is far from that lofty peak.Intelligence is about people and processes. That is missing in what is basically a picture book that does little to expose the reader to the operational aspects of intelligence gathering, nor of its collation, analysis and distribution.The semi-serious reader will gain virtually nothing from this work, other than finding a new and somewhat expensive coaster for the coffee table. Better still don't buy it and spend the money on any one of dozens of better works listed here on Amazon."
1,"It had really nice pictures, however it lacked substance.","If the price was only $5 it would be a good book, howeverthe price is much higher than that. I enjoyed the historicalcontent of the book, but the technical aspects were poorlydeveloped."
2,High Hopes Dashed,"I love the work of Alistair Galbraith, The Renderers, Roy Montgomery, and The Dead C, and had high hopes for this book. Sadly, it doesn't live up to them or all the blurbs about how one won't read a better book about New Zealand music (perhaps because no one else has written one)... It just seems like a young man's meandering memories of his band, but it mostly covers his band and barely touches on their myriad encounters with other bands. Maybe, he could come out with another edition, and include more info about the other bands & less about The Sneaky Feelings!"
3,Does NOT precisely fit a 2000 Dodge Ram 1500 Pickup Truck,"This part will bolt in properly and provide air for a 2000 Dodge RAM 1500 Pickup heater box. However, the fan motor cooling port is not in the right spot. Also, the blower motor housing cover does not have the same bolt pattern as this motor. So, essentially you can use it to repair your heater box, but you won't be able to get everything back together as with OEM. You'll have to leave the dash's plastic blower motor cover off, and leave the fan motor cooling hose dangling out of the heater box."
3,Noisy blower,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 1998 DODGE RAM. AFTER INSTALLATION, THIS ITEM IS NOISY, IT MUST BE A ""SECOND"" IN QUALITY WHICH IS HOW THEY GOT THE REALLY GOOD PRICE."
1,Fact or Fiction?,"While there are valid points the author makes, the majority of the book ignores the primary reason for the actions taken by the Israelis. The author ignores the terrorism that the Palestinian people embrace. The author does not answer questions such as, ""Why are Palestinian children placed on front lines by their parents?"" I was not impressed at all."
3,Great inside to Jesse James.,Get the real scoop on the real jesse james. this goes beyond the hollywood glamour portrayal that typically depicts jesse as a folk hero.
3,standard replacement piece,"No complaints or rave reviews; it is a standard replacement piece similar to what is found in stores. It is made of brown plastic, with a spring inside."
3,A bit dissapointed,"I am a longtime Warcraft fan and have collected the related figures since the first ones were released in 1998. When I heard that three new ones were coming out; based on Warcraft III: Prince Arthas the Death Knight, Tichondrius the Darkener, and Shandris Feathermoon Night Elf Archer, I couldn't wait to get them. I have to say, that although they are all very cool, they don't measure up to the previous batch. Blizzard went with a new manufacturer with these, and the quality just is not even close to the previous ones. If you're a Warcraft fanatic, they will be cool additions to your collection, but do what you can to get your hands on the hard to get, unfortunately discontinued, previous three: Thrall(Orc), Muradin Bronzebeard (human) and Furion Stormrage (elf). Those were gold where these are bronze. I only hope the next series will be more impressive."
1,Very poor grammar,"Do not choose this edition! I am very familiar with this title, and have passed it on to many. Now, looking for an inexpensive copy for a group, I chose this publication of the title. Murray is from the late 19th C, as is his language, so although it is a bit more of a struggle for today's reader's, his concepts are clearly presented. However, this version has not been edited! Entire sentences are missing, there are commas where none belong, and many absent where there should be. This makes Murray's ideas even more difficult to understand. I instead chose the title from another publisher and paid a few more dollars. The other publication, by Whitaker House, ISBN 9780883681060, is by far superior to this very poor edition."
5,With Christ in the School of Prayer,This was one of the first books that I received shortly after I trusted Christ as my Savior over 40 years ago. I loved it then and I love it now as I find myself returning to it during various seasons of my life. Highly recommended.
2,this is an MP# CD,Note that this is an MP3 CD. It is not an audio CD that you can plunk into your CD player right away. Could be a bit annoying to deal with.
1,Big Disappointment,"This book was a big disappointment. While it is of some value in regards to prayer, the author seems to have no ability to rightly divide the Word. He claims promises made to Israel as true for the church today. Also, the author is totally in the dark about the mystery (secret) that Paul revealed in his epistles."
2,a miss,"I didn't find that this book really covered accounting principles. I learned more about Jades and Burma than about accounting. The theories that it did touch on was only covered very loosely.Not to mention the editing, character and basic writing mistakes. The story was pretty amateurish as well unfortunately."
3,"Pretty good, for an accounting book :)",I had to read this book for my honor's accounting class. I was surprised with the book because it was able to include accounting principles rather well (sometimes it feels forced) while also giving a good story. The writing pretty good and this book would be good for any accounting class.
1,the usual fare,"I don't know why I keep reviewing Czerny books. If you've seen one (op. 139, 599, 823), you've seen them all. They all start with a marathon of melodies in the key of C, repeating the tonic and dominant chords until you can scream.They all consist of square melodies in the binary form, with the same chords in the same places, and with the same rink-chink harmonic treatment. Counterpoint, what's that?"
2,Another Rather Pointless Gary Numan Collection,"This was one of many curious Gary Numan collections to come our way in the 90s. Fourteen tracks - singles, album tracks, and B-sides all thrown together with no rhyme or reason. Some of these songs are good (""The Hunter"", ""Tricks""), some aren't (""The Need"")... I'm not sure who picked these tracks and why. Come to think of it, I'm not sure why it's called THE OTHER SIDE OF GARY NUMAN, either. If you're looking for a collection of Gary Numan from this period, I'd steer you towards NEW DREAMS FOR OLD instead."
1,Worst of Gary Numan,"This is a curiously bad compilation.I have several Gary Numan albums and would give all of them 4 or 5 stars.As for this compilation, I found some of these tracks to be nearly unlistenable. There's some poorly recorded live songs and some of the failed attempts at a funkier pop sound. As Alf Kremer said in his review, ""I'm not sure who picked these tracks and why"".This compilation should be titled ""The Worst of Gary Numan"".-J_Tom_Moon_79"
5,Best support ever!,"I have had and used this tool for over two years now. One of the sliding legs for depth adjustment snapped as I carelessly pulled on it. I looked and looked for a replacement and couldn't find one anywhere. Went back to KREG.COM and contacted their support via email and asked where I could purchase another leg. I got an email back the next day (Monday) and Dan Fisher said he was sorry for the problem and would send one to me in the mail. I got it today, 3 days later, they had to pay $1.50 postage for delivery and now this tool is functioning again, no charge to me for my mistake. WOW, try that with anyone else. You would be laughed at, this is the best service I have ever received from anyone for anything. Fantastic, two years old and still working as well as the first day I tried it. Can't say enough about KREG. Not only does the tool do everything you could want from it but the company follows suit with actual service. BUT IT NOW! Don't wait!"
5,great tool,Got this as a gift recently and I'm loving it. The instructions were clear and I was able to quickly use it on a project I was working on.
5,Kreg Jr.,Home handyman and this is the greatest tool I have bought. Am building cabinets and they are looking great. Took a little of practice for layout and setup but then this is great. Practice and layout important.
4,Mostly OK,Does a good job overall for the $$. Can be a bit cumbersom to clamp up and locate correctly. The drill bit is lacking quality on the step grind and leaves rough edges to clean up if you want a nice clean plug job. Needs more of a negative angle here like good quality step drills have and the burr wouldn't exist. I'm a journeyman machinist and have made many drills so I know this wouldn't be a great task for them. Otherwise it's a handy tool.
5,Love it!,I've been an amateur woodworker for about 10 years and I can't believe it has taken me so long to get one of these jigs. I just used it to build a cornhole board and it works like a champ. I love this little thing!
5,"Rock On, Kreg R3 Jr.","Based on the 5 star ratings, it's clear the Kreg R3 Jr. is a solid woodworking tool. But the R3 Jr. isn't only for hobbyists. Because when it comes to enhanced interrogations and confession gathering, the R3 Jr. is simply unrivaled. As an interrogator for Syria's General Security Directorate, I've probably seen - and used - just about every asset out there. And unquestionably, no single pain-infliction device has the R3 Jr.'s combination of portability, reliability, low cost, and acute pain and terror infliction. My colleagues and I rely on the Kreg R3 Jr. day in and day out. If you've got a tough subject that won't crack, you should too."
5,"Worked great, used it right away!","Setup was really straightforward and delivered perfect pocket holes from the first try. Small size is perfect for tight areas, yet jig feels sturdy enough to last for a long time."
4,Vague Instructions,"This is a very handy little tool. Only problem is that even with a rather tight clamp, it's a little slick and tends to slide around if you aren't careful. Seems like a little piece of rubber on the stuck to the side facing the wood might solve this problem. As it is, you probably need to buy the accessory clamp to keep it in place better. Still, not enough of a problem to prevent my recommendation."
4,Kreg R3 Jr.,"Although it looks and feels kind of cheap when you first handle it, it works exactly as advertised. Buy the clamp that goes with it. I didn't and I wish I had."
4,Keg Jr. Pocket jig,This works well. A little pricey for a one time project but now that I have it I'm sure I will you it as often as I can.
4,Handy tool to have around,"I bought this thinking I would be using it to build some cabinets and bookcases, however the first project it was used for was to attach a handrail to an end post. I have to say this worked great. The only issue I have with it is the adjustable depth guides seem a little cheap and could possibly wear out rather quickly. The other is the markings in the bit holder to help you adjust the depth of the stop collar, it could be off as much as an 1/8"" depending where the bit is resting. The plastic tray in the case is very light weight plastic and won't stand up to any sort of abuse. So if it breaks you'll be out your collar adjustment guide.Don't get me wrong, I love this tool. Considering the price of this one and the next level up, I think I can deal with a few trimmed corners."
4,Kreg Jig,I got this Kreg unit for a specific purpose but I've had fun putting things together with the jig. It works as advertised and would buy it again
4,Good value for the money.,"This is an inexpensive tool, but it does solve the problem of drilling shallow-angle pocket holes in wood. I think the steel drill bushings should extend further, but I'm an engineer and tool maker, so I'm more critical than most."
2,Over Paid for Sore Thumbs & Faulty Assembly,"I purchased this mower after waiting for my Lawn Boy to die (it lasted 10 years). I had high expectations for the product given the reputation of Honda Mowers. I was very disappointed when a persisent gas leak discolored my mower deck. It turned out that the sealing gasket in the gas tank was not installed at the factory. Also, the Smart Drive leads to thumb fatigue and discomfort. All-in-all, an average performer at a premium price. Enough that I am done with Honda branded products, including their automobiles as Toyota is an always good buy.This paragraph comes about a year later than the previous information. My mower is now non-functioning due to a manufacturing defect with a spring used in the Roto Drive blade engagement system. I just discovered that the spring is subject to a recall. I wonder what the next problem will be with this overpriced, sub-standard product. Do not buy Honda lawnmowers!"
2,Average craft reading,"This book was a mistake, I cannot even remember ordering it. I must have had fat fingers that evening.It is a ho hum book on Scrapbooking. Nothing that stands out.I probably will place this item up for sale.Hope this helpsBrenda"
2,"Great Hype, Poor Delivery","After reading the reviews of this cookbook, I really looked forward to a GREAT vegetarian cookbook. But, what I am finding is the recipes are either too bland or not complete. I feel that something was left out.... For example: Potato Lasagna of Wild Mushrooms with Herb Sauce (page 130) left me with an uncooked taste in the potatoes. I am now wondering if something was left out of the recipe. The Garden Paella (page 128) turned out bland and not very tasty. I can not believe that Mario Leon-Iriarte is serving this at his resturant. Overall, the recipes look great, but I'm suspicous that the author didn't try them out before publishing this book. Few are working for me."
1,Poor directions--not very clear. This is not a good book.,"Just got this for Christmas and tried the first recipe tonight. Check out the recipe for Butternut Squash & Leek Soup on p. 43. Hardly gives you any directions--Would be nice to know what level of heat to use, whether to cover pan, and how long to cook. You can do alot better."
3,"Dayton DC130BS-4 5-1/4"" Classic Shielded Woofer 4 Ohm","The woofer sounds good but not great, it will distort at high volume but for the price i feel i at least got my moneys worth. I used it as a replacement speaker in my home audio."
4,Does the job!,"Strong, sturdy, and looks clean! It's well constructed and we pack a ton on these shelves. Definitely recommendable!Thank you,David - NYC"
5,Great shelving unit,"Well built, easy to assemble, supports lots of weight. Make sure that the dimensions are what you are looking for -- this is a relatively small unit."
4,"The ""RACK""","I'm very, very pleased, I made a very good deciscion when I purchased this RACK, I'm very, very happy. I'm also planning on getting the 3-tier rack,I donnot know how I was operating with out the Whitmor 6060-322 Supreme 4-Tier in Chrome. Space saver."
5,stainless shelves,"Easy to assemble, adjustable, looks great and reasonably priced. These shelves are excellent for organizing storage spaces in tight areas or in a garage."
5,"Good product, good value, very sturdy.","I bought one unit as a test, then ordered two more because the design was perfect for my application (banker box storage). Like many items with ""some assembly required,"" my first attempt required about 30 minutes. Once I figured out how it ties together, the next two units required only 5 minutes each. Very sturdy shelves and overall design. By properly positioning the bottom shelf, I was able to fit 10 fully loaded banker boxes (8 on the shelves, 2 on the floor). I'll buy more of these shelves as I need them. Good deal for the money."
5,very happy with this shelving unit,I bought this to use for in-closet storage in a home office. It was very easy to put together by myself within minutes. No tools are needed unless you want to use a level and the attached adjustable feet to make sure it's level. It seems very sturdy.
5,Shelves,The shelves arrived quickly and were relatively easy to assemble. I appreciate the sturdy construction and the very reasonable price.
3,Its so so,It does its job but it was definitely painful to assemble. I wish they made products that were easy to put together..
4,"Great Shelf, Great Price","The shelf was of high quality construction and looked very nice. I was especially impressed for the price point of the shelf. The shelving unit is very sturdy and does not bend, sway, etc. The top shelf doesn't sit 100% level, but it's pretty close and it's extremely minor so this issue will go unnoticed. Instructions weren't exactly the best, but hey I got the job done. If it wasn't for the top shelf not being perfect and the lame instruction manual, then this would easily be a five star product. If I could give it 4.5 stars, I definitely would. I'd definitely buy another if I needed more space."
5,Bought Two!,"I purchased one of these units for a bathroom at work. It was so nice, we decided to buy another!"
5,Sturdy and Easy to Assemble,"I'm 66 years old and had this unit assembled in ten minutes. Just what I wanted: inexpensive, easy-to-assemble, and sturdy."
3,Shelving unit,These shelves are just not strong enough for what I needed. They are however very nice to have for light duty. The castors were not heavy enough to push around the weight that I needed it for.
2,package misfit,"Item came with package open. The company had secured all pieces with nylon ties, tape and plastic bags so nothing was lost.Once corner posts are secure and the customer slips the black plastic into place (used to hold the shelf in place) these plastic pieces do not stay in place making it difficult to level the shelves."
2,Not really a disaster movie,This movie is a disappointment when it comes to disasters. Nothing really happens. If you like the typical scifi tv movies you will like this one since it seems to go along with how scifi does it movies. Was very predictable. Could have been a lot better. Just very poorly done. I gave 2.50 for it. So i guess I really can't complain much.
1,A COMPLETE JOKE & WASTE OF TIME!,(VERY SIMPLE- NOT WORTH EVEN (1) STAR >> A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME) ...SAVE YOUR MONEY! DONOT PURCHASE THIS JUNK!!!
1,*BORING*,I was so bored with this book I didn't finish reading it. I like Lucy Monroe but was disappointed in this book.
2,"BAD BOYS, BAD STORIES?",The love scenes are hot but the stories are just too short. No character development.
1,3 Brides for 3 Brothers,I can describe this book in one word stupid. Don't waste your time or money it simply isn't worth it. In fact I am not even sure why it was published. One star was being generous.
5,Very good book...,"Emotionally compelling, pushing us to the limit. You'll laugh as well as sob as you read your way through this heart warming story. Characterization is great, dialog natural, conclusion satisfying.Janet Sue Terry - Contemporary Romance AuthorRead the SET MY FREE TWO BOOK SERIESBook- 1, ""Possibilities,"" and Book 2, ""Resolutions""And - ""Just Our Best Short Stories 2005.Learn more about this author by visiting her website""(...)"
2,Poor quality fabric,"These sheets are of very thin, poor quality fabric. If you hold them up, you can pretty readily see what's on the other side. There are loose thread ends, thick threads and thin spots.That said, they're the only flat sheets I've been able to find for a toddler bed that aren't in a set. They didn't disintegrate in the washing machine, which was initially a concern. The stitching is okay, and the fitted end has kept the 3 year old from tearing the bed apart for over a week."
1,Nice sheets overpriced shipping,"These sheets are nice that they are fitted at one end.They are not the softest sheets, but they are not the worst either.I ordered 4 of these sheets and I was charged for four separate shipping charges even though it was shipped in one shipment. (Hence the rating)"
4,Speaking engagement,The author spoke at our convocation today. She is an excellent speaker: very engaging and entertaining. Would highly recommend.
5,A Must Read!,"This beautifully written book explores the Iranian Revolution from the perspective of a young Jewish girl. Hakakian is a delicious writer and her description of pre and post-revolutionary Iran is vivid and stimulating. As a frequent reader of this genre, I found this book to be far and away the best in its category and highly recommend it to anyone interested in Iran and the country's current imbroglio, women's studies or Judaism."
4,K2--Awesome Game but...,"I just finished beating KH2. It took me about a week and a half. Compared to how long it took me to beat the first one, this is pretty surreal. Still the gameplay is much easier. I'm glad the makers chose to make it more user friendly. It could have been a little more difficult though. Gameplay is improved.Positives: Awesome graphics. Great fighting scenarios. Cool new worlds like Steamboat Willie. Inventive enemies.Negatives: A little too easy. A little too long to get into gameplay. Too much talking, not enough fighting. I felt like i was watching a movie instead of playing a game half of the time.Anti-climatic. I cried at the end of Kingdom Hearts. Part 2, I was still moved, but not as much. CONFUSING STORY LINE. I'm still not sure exactly what happened. And can someone tell me what happened to Malificent and Pete? They had a story line right? I suppose that will be KH3."
5,Kingdom Hearts II,This game is just as awesome as the first one if not better. They upgraded the combat system by adding drives but they made the summons less fun to s fight with. That's just the combat system the graphics's are just amazing especially at the ending. They add some new characters as well as keeping some old ones. The storyline is so complex that it would take me a very long time to finish. The characters are very complex as well. It is a very long game (which is a good thing). The music is very fun to listen to and the voices in the game are very well-done too. All in all this is a must-have for all PlayStation 2 owners.
5,Fav game ever!,"This is my favorite game ever,& I play a LOT of games!I am 12 & this game is SO easy(in beginner mode)!At first the game is really confusing because you start out as a completely different character!But later in the game everything explains itself!It's so much fun cause you can go to a lot of Disney places!I love the Lion King the most 'cause you turn into a baby lion cub!Overall the game is a 5 star!!!:D"
4,grr,I love this game but i cant play on my ps3 so that pist me off. I wish some one had told me that would of happened
2,What was Squaresoft Thinking???,"I cant blame Disney for this one, its all on Squaresoft. There is NO GAME HERE. Mash on the X button and move on. I know 10 year olds who would get bored with this gameplay. Whats worse, the story- whatever little there is, unfolds very very slowly. Most of the time you go to worlds that re-create the films they came from with wierd battles that make no sense. The sped up versions of the worlds' story make for an experience not unlike seing the Beauty and the Beast 17 minute show at MGM Studios. Only difference is it is experienced for multiple films and in video game form. I think the characters in the prologue showed the most intrigue but alas they arent to be the center of the story. Ignore the Disney freaks here- the only thing worse than a lame Disney sequel is a lame Disney video game!! Stay away from Kingdom Hearts II."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I really really enjoyed the first Kingdom Hearts. It was challenging and fun. Even though Disney characters were included, they were not involved in the same ol story lines we have seen for years.Unfortunately most of he worlds here are basically just re-enacting the storylines of the movies.I think this game is much easier, I am playing on the hardest level and have yet to be defeated to where I have to start over. I also purchased the Strategy guide, as it was 20% when I purchased the game. I have not even looked at it once. No reason to...just to easy.Overall I am disappointed. I thought that with the long wait we had to endure, and how awesome the first one was, this would have been well worth waiting for. But it does not live up to expectations. At least for me.I have not beat it yet, just re-visiting worlds now. Because unlike last time, where I would stay up for hours in the evenings playing, I have been able to shut this one off. :("
5,So Much Fun!,"It's an addictive game. It's very fun to play and it makes a good game to play during the summer because it has a story. You also get to see some Disney characters like Donald Duck and Goofy, so when you play, kids like to watch you."
4,Kingdom hearts,I am glad that the game came and I though it was very fun and it was a lot better than kingdom hearts 1
5,Arrived quickly,This was a gift for my bf so I don't know how great the game is. But it came in the mail very quickly and my bf loved the gift.
5,Best game ever!,"This game is seriously the best game ever. I have become such a fan of kingdom hearts, that I check every other day for the release date of Kingdom Hearts III. I would recommend this game to everybody, because it's just so darn entertaining."
4,Kingdom Hearts 2 (unexpected),"I started to play Kingdom Hearts 2, and I thought it was going to be just like the first, I was wrong. Some things new to the game, Drives-ability to fuse you character with your other ones, New Playable Characters-you get to play as Roxes a boy from Twilight town,and King Mickey, plus they're plot twists. Two problems with the game though, 1.If you hadn't played Chains of Memories for the gameboy you won't recongize some characters. 2. The constant cut scenes get aggervating after a while. I giv KH2 a 4 out of 5."
4,"A great place to visit, but . . . . .","I loved the first game. I found myself really sucked into the whole world of Kingdom Hearts. So, needless to say, I was thrilled to get the sequel, but I was a little let down. The characters are great, the art is top-notch, the voice acting is SUPERB, to say the least (some of the best voice acting I've ever heard, in fact) but I feel like the worlds sort of fall flat. They are a little boring. The Lion King world, for example, is just a flat plain, and then a path through a gorge, then a path through a canyon, then a path through a forest . . . you get the idea.Also, the came is outrageously easy. All you have to do to win almost every battle is hit X over and over. But still, it is a good game, and worth your money if your a Squaresoft or Disney fan."
3,"""ehh"" at best...","After beating the first Kingdom Hearts, i had high expectations, considering the ""to be continued"" ending. Although I can say the story does deliver in this sequel, the game is just TOO EASY!!! I beat it in about a week, and the only thing left for me is obtaining the ultimate weapon (which is pointless when i earned a stronger one for beating Sephiroth). And the colisseum is... practically pointless. Only about 3 or 4 fights against some weak heartless and you gain absolutely no experience from any of it!! And leveling up is way too fast in this game, I've gotten up to lvl 92 now, and I can kill any creature in 5 hits or less. and the final boss is just too easy also. Great game for the kids, but for us older gamers who enjoyed the first one, wait until its on sale and u won't regret it. And just some advice, if you've beaten the first one, start this one on proud mode, might make it a little more challenging."
2,FIRST ONE WAS BETTER!!! TOO EASY,"PROS: Some of the Bosses are harderThe Sommons are CoolerSora can do alot more better moves which makes it funNew worlds were okCONS: The Story line suckedShortNo Puzzles like the first oneThere are ""Subtitles"" at the top of the screen that tells you what to do and where to go which makes it way too easyOVERALL: Fighting was funner, but the game was too EASY. Maybe they made it easier so younger kids could play. Even in difficult mode the game tells you what to do and where to go. Kind of Stupid I think. No Challenge at all. And after you visit the worlds once you visit them one more time, but they are so easy.Didn't really like this game. If it wasn't for the cool moves and sommons Sora does, I wouldn't like this game at all.THIS IS NOT A GAME TO PLAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN. RENT IT, BEAT IT, THEN BRING IT BACK. TRUST ME, THE GAME IS SO SHORT AND EASY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THE HUGE STRATEGY GUIDE???"
1,TOO BORING!,"I could play Kingdom Hearts I, over and over but, Kindom Hearts II is too boring! There is too much talking and not enough action. I am too disappointed in this game because of the high standard that Kingdom Hearts I set."
5,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!!!...........not,look man if u do not like this game U R INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!! this game is my favorite game ever!! parents all i want 2 say is that it is a very good and clean game no cussing at all. the only 2 things they say is jerk and idiot. kids u would love this game. BUY IT!!!!!!
4,Fun but too easy!,"This game is one of the best games I have ever played! There are only a couple confusing parts:1. Why do they keep changing from the characters actually talking to speech bubbles? It doesn't make sense!2. The first boss is more like watching a cutscene in someplaces.3. What's with the freaky little thing that you have to battle to win the tournament in the beginning? It's so weird!But other than those things, this is the best game ever!"
5,One of the better Kingdom Hearts games,"My friend is the one who should me this game. We stayed at his house all night playing it. If you are a Kingdom Hearts fan, Final fantasy fan, or are just looking for a good mix of action and story this is the game for you."
4,"Second is the worst, First is the best?","When I finished the first Kingdom Hearts I eagerly awaited until amazon sent me the second, but I didn't get what I expected. For some reason I thought it would be the exact same gameplay with a continuation of the story. Only I soon realized that it was completely different game, and I contemplated putting it away and never playing it again.I gave it another shot and really got into it. All I had to do was separate one from the other, and the last battle with Xemnas was twenty times harder than the Ansem boss battle (which is a good thing). I will always like the first game better, but i'm glad I got past the differences and played Kingdom Hearts II."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this game is great and i think you'd be missing out on something special if you didn't get a hold of this one
2,Catch-22,"I have bad news and worse news, the bad is that if you played Kingdom Hearts I you will absolutely hate Kingdom Hearts 2. The game play is non-exsistant, the story line is at the 1st grade level, and everything they did right in the first game is now gone. The worse news is that the only way one would enjoy this game is if they had never played KH1. BUT if you never played KH1 you will never understand KH2....even at its 1st grade level. You have to give SquareEnix credit, in order to mess up the Final Fantasy Franchise (they are responsible for the horrible FFX2 as well) this bad they really had to work hard. I am sorry to say that I am afraid that FFX is the last we will ever see of the FF world. But to pull some good news out of all of this, if you like a 50 hour Disney commercial then this is the game for you. In several worlds you play the EXACT story-line of many of the Disney movies. There is no doubt what is coming next in the game.....and for some that might be a good thing????"
4,Kingdom Hearts II is whats hot,"At first i wasnt too keen on playing this games because i thought that it was childish with the disney characters and all but not anymore this game is a fun, difficult game that i think that everyone that plays it will enjoy"
5,Back again,It's Kara again I just had to say I LOVE KINGDOM HEARTS! and to agree/dissagree with some people I was among those who thought it was going to be dum at first I'm sorry but it's true but as soon as i played i got hooked i've been waiting years for this game!!!! they kept changing the date but finnaly it got here I'm very happy for that I don't want to give anything away but it's tottaly worth it Kairi looks so cool but i gotta go now oh and cloud strife you've only been waiting a year?!?!!??!!?
5,IT ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought it and it is cooool! but final form in the drive ability is so powerful I call sora '' super sora'' . I would get this game if I were you!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Beautifully Rendered Disney/FF Eye Candy, but Tediously Long Cut Scenes","Kingdom Hearts II is a beautifully rendered PS2 game. The music and voice talent is outstanding.But the game mechanics are almost non-existant. The game is quite long, but that is because of the tediously regular cutscenes. The actual player-controlled portions of Kingdom Hearts II are far too short.Seeing the many Disney worlds in Kingdom Hearts II is fun, but the exploration is limited and too linear.Kingdom Hearts II is a fine game for pre-teens that enjoy watching pretty special effects...But anyone older will probably find the gameplay tedious."
4,The negative side,"Alright -- lots of love for the first game, BUT we are talking about Kingdom Hearts 2.If you loved the detailed locations of the first game get ready to be dissapointed in this one. So simple its almost 2 dementional. Remember how you had to jump all over the place to find stuff...not so much.Easy. The Easy mode actually got ME bored and I am one of the most none-gamers out there.If you have a little kid that is crying (like I was) because they are getting killed on Easy Mode on Kingdom Hearts (1) give them 2 and have them learn the basics before going back to the original.The plot is also slimmer than the last one, but for those of us that have been chewing on the bit waiting for this game...well...here it is...::shrug:: the animation is really nice..."
2,"Fun, but uncompelling...","I'm going to set this into pros and cons...Pros: Good gameplayFunPlays like the originalCons: All of the good voice acting from the original was whored out to talentless hacks.Answers too many questions that ""weren't asked"" and took away from the big questions presented at the end of the first game.Has extremely generic philosophical references.Has unexplained changes in characters, as well as inaccurate references to the games they were derived from (especially FF7).Arguably too easy."
5,Awesome!,"It came right when I needed it to, and it was awesome. Plot is perfect too, and it's fun. I would definitely recommend this."
3,Letdown,"Kingdom Hearts II is not as enjoyable as the first Kingdom Hearts. The story isn't as good, and neither is the gameplay. I would call it mildly entertaining."
3,A fun PS2 game,"This game eliminates boredom and allows one to enjoy their PS2 machine. This game is fun and interesting. Enjoy, have fun gaming!"
5,You'll play it over and over again,"I've had this game since it first came out in 2007 and I've mastered this game so well that I'm still buying more and playing it more.This game is incredible. Story is in depth, and after you play the other games, every flaw in this is ""filled in"". I don't think ANYONE would find this boring! You travel to memorable worlds of Disney, meet characters of Final Fantasy games, and much more. Rich graphics, sweet gameplay, awesome story, and characters make this a favorite of any gamer out there. I'm a complete KH fan, so I will NEVER say no to this series! This game is better and slightly easier than the original, and may be confusing at first... That's why you get Re: Chain of Mermories, 358/2 Days, Birth by Sleep, and of course, the first game! Enjoy an awesome game that will ""touch your heart!"" The game is all about friendship, evil, and did I mention friendship? Sora, the main character, is BEAST! (Whom you meet)"
4,Good quality RPG,"If you liked the first one, you'll like this one because it's more of the same stuff. This game mixes up the play pretty well and and has a good balance. It's interesting (and fun) to fight with Donald, Goofy and Mickey mouse right next to all the FF charters. I loved that you could choose the difficulty level (all games should do this), and I would swear that if you keep losing to a boss that the game adjusts the difficulty down (very innovative if that is indeed the case). Plays at about 40 hours or so."
3,Not bad but not ground breaking,I was looking forward to this game but i completed it on standard mode within under 3 weeks. It was far too short and easy. Nothing paticularry excited me either. It was dissapointing that there was no gameplay in destiny islands at the end. I sort of enjoyed the story but it was far too short.
4,Keyblade to Kingdom,"This game is really fun!!!!! However, I still have likes and dislikes about KH2. Likes:the drive forms,new worlds,new keyblades,camera system,the fight with Sephiroth,and the rection commands.Dislikes:the game is WAY TO EASY!Xemnas,the final battle is to easy.Finally, the anti form. Overall, this is a classic, just the like the original KINGDOM HEARTS.This is my favorite game."
3,Dissapointed.,"I was really looking forward to this game as i loved the first kh but i got bored of that because iv'e played it so many times before.Although i did enjoy this game i found it really easy and too simple. I completed it very quickly and i didn't get a thrill out of it. It was shorter than kh1 and it got pretty boring at times.If your'e going to get this game, please don't get your'e hopes up..its not ground breaking at all."
5,Great Reasoning Book,"My daughters loved this book. The mystery held their interest, with just enough clues to that they were able to figure out the whodunnit along with the detectives. I'd recommend it for kids in grades 2 - 4."
5,Third grade mysteries,I gave this book and other third grade mysteries to my granddaughter for Christmas. Her mother reports that she won't stop reading! And she often stops to share details of the stories. We are happy.
2,Not so convenient.,There isn't an over the shoulder strap to carry the pack with... i'd recommend another mode of storing and carrying your 7b battery pack.
3,psycho circus 3d,some1 said that the show that was done halloween nite in 1998 for the beginning of the psycho circus tour was done in detroit is wrong about where it was at because i was at the show. the show was done at dodgers stadium in los angeles california!
3,For collectors,"This one is for the dedicated Kiss fan. There is two different ""Psycho Circus"" video on the tape: a 3D version and the ""standard"" version (3D glasses are included). The 3D version is awesome. The 3D effects are really well made.The included CD contains two songs: ""Psycho Circus"" and ""In Your Face"" (from the European ""Psycho Circus"" CD).A good buy for a Kiss fan but nothing to call your mother..."
4,KISS is ahead of the game agian,I own this vhs video I love it. The best thing is KISS did 3-D in 1999 and the rest of the world is now just catching up with KISS 11 years later. Now tell me there not the greatest band.
4,A must for true KISS fans,"I agree with some of the other reviewers in that the 3-D effects from the live show were much better than the videos, but all in all it is a well made video. I too would like to see KISS produce a full lenghth concert video like Metallica's ""Cunning Stunts"" video. The KISS popularity comes from thier live shows not thier ability to be interviewed, and there live performances come accross well on video."
3,bbok was a lot older than realized,book did arrive in a timely manner. Glad for that. Condition was not really as good as advertised in my opinion. kind of OLD. but OK. it was the content itself that I wanted. Very hard to find certain authors in the area here. Love amazon as alternative. thanks.
1,Nothing new or exciting,"The author took a treasure hunt and pieced this quilt out of a hundred other cliched romances. I had a hard time believing the heroine could be socially acceptable if she worked in a tavern. Read ""The Quilter's Apprentice"" or rent ""How to Make An American Quilt"" instead of this mispieced adventure"
3,A waster,"I have no idea why I bought this when it came out in 1984 or 85. Reflex, I guess. It is recorded well, but is a completely unnecessary record. There are better versions of all these songs, except maybe ""Pipleline"". Nothing new.Not worth it."
5,"So far, so good!","Have made sure to give mine a mineral oil bath every so often, but it is nice and flat (no warping) and hasn't cracked after several months of use. I will say it is better for fruits and vegetables than it is for larger items, and I haven't tried it at all for meat (I am of the school that thinks it's better to have a separate cutting board for raw meats). Looks nice and the price was fair. Recommended!"
5,Woolley Willie,"Willie has done it again, but even better with Kimmie Rhodes. The two really make a great team for these duets"
3,A good basic history of the Lincoln Assassination,"This book, a volume in the Time-Life Civil War collection, is a good basic history of Lincoln's Assassination. As with the other volumes in the Time-Life series, this book has wonderful photographs and images from the Civil War period. I would recommend this book to people with little or no previous reading on Lincoln's assassination."
5,Perl Debugged book review,"This was a surprise gem for me. I had been looking at several Perl books that covered debugging. I already have a couple of good references for the Perl debugger; what I wanted was a book that was more about ""how"" to debug...strategies, techniques, etc. The other books on debugging Perl was I looked at appeared to be more comprehensive but I didn't want to have to read any really long books. I decided to try this one which seemed to cover the topics I was looking for and was a tractable book in terms of length. I was really surprised at just how superb this book is. It did cover the topics I thought and hoped it would; but the writing style was surprising and terrific for me."
5,great meta-book on perl,"Fun book, of 3 perl metabooks (others Hall/Schwartz Efficient Perl (everybody shd read) and Brown's Debugging Perl (I haven't read much) ). There's ""35 best hackers"", good bibliographies/TOC index could be more detailed) and the 1st 100 pages had me thinking authors were watching my perl screwups over my shoulder. One wish list item: more info on vim, gnu/xemacs (getting syntax coloring/tabbing right on NT, compiling .els)$1MM Question: can these books keep perl growing? Python,ruby don't seem to need these debugging/dev practices books.Another question: can any books on perl/python stay up to date? Since this came out: komodo (you are trying to get your boss to pay $250 subscription, aren't you?), Visual perl/python, python DBI, 3 or 4 more Oreillys, etc. etc."

One wish list item: more info on vim, gnu/xemacs (getting syntax coloring/tabbing right on NT, compiling .els)$1MM Question: can these books keep perl growing? Python,ruby don't seem to need these debugging/dev practices books.Another question: can any books on perl/python stay up to date? Since this came out: komodo (you are trying to get your boss to pay... subscription, aren't you?), Visual perl/python, python DBI, 3 or 4 more Oreillys, etc. etc."
4,Romantic but...,This novel was very romantic but I found it a little slow moving. I enjoyed the movie and I liked that the novel was more complex with more issues. I did think it was a little slow. It was however a good read and I did enjoy it.
4,"If you're a fan of the movie, read for a different take","Okay, I saw the movie first.The movie, Somewhere in Time, starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, is my favorite movie of all time. I felt like I needed to read the book because ""the book is always better.""Well, I loved the book, but I have to say I still love the movie more. The book has an even more tragic premise, if you can imagine. Richard is dying before he goes back in time. Going back in time is not only the experience of a lifetime for him... when he falls desperately in love and lives a sweet few days, but he is also relieved of his pain.If you're a fan, read the book. If you're in love with the movie, watch it again."
3,It's a good book but....,I have to agree with Emily W's review. I liked this book it's not that I hated it but this is one of those rare times when the movie actually improved the story. That doesn't happen too often but here it did. Luckily I had read the book first before I saw the movie. I wasnt't disappointed in the book. But it was just ok. I fell in love with the movie though
3,The book was good but........,"I thought this book was good, but I really think the movie was better, and for me, usually it's the other way around"
3,Somewhere in Time,We visited Mackinaw Island this fall and I wanted to read the book because the movie was filmed there. The book was very interesting and I also bought the movie.
4,Very intriguing,"At first, I wondered if I would be able to cope with the author's style. He writes in the first person, as if he is dictating to a machine: little vignettes of his observations as he goes about his day, much like an author's sketch pad. However, continuing with him, as he ponders his future, I began to get involved with him in his life and his musings, which really sucked me into the thread of the story. . . . A very good read."
3,The movie was better,"I've wanted to read this book since I saw the movie, Somewhere In Time, but it's been too expensive (over $60.00). Its finally come down in price (under $20.00) and I was a little disappointed. The movie is one of my all time favorites, but I thought the book was just all right. This is one of those rare instances where the movie was better than the book."
2,"I Don't Understand All of the 5 Stars,This Book Sucks",I'm the type who always likes to finish a book. This book is definitely NOT a book you can't put down. I had to keep forcing myself to pick it back up. I am a Richard Matheson fan but I did not like this book at all. It's just weird and to me it almost seems like he shouldn't be writing a love story. I really don't understand all of the 5 stars. I think the 5 stars come from people who have seen the movie and maybe their opinion is tainted by that. I have never seen the movie but the book does seem like it would be a good movie. The story is just not deep enough for a book.
2,overrated,"I bought the book after reading the great reviews and because I like time-travel books. I am very disappointed. The whole book feels more like the ravings of a man half-mad. The transitions from scene to scene are poorly done. The characters are not well-developed. Although time-travel is supposed to be hard to believe to begin with, this story line is particularly unconvincing. I cannot feel for either of the two main characters. I can see how it can make a good movie without the distraction of the poor writing style. The protagonist's ravings about how much he loves this girl whom he has never met and his constant apologies to her once he meets her are just plain annoying. I had to force myself to finish the book. A great let-down."
1,This book changed my life.,"I have never been interested in romance novels. The only reason why I read this one is because my grandmother had the sound track from the movie and I believe it is the most beautiful music in the whole world. Now, my next goal, is to read Bid Time Return(if I can find a copy). I hope you get a chance to read this book, enjoy it if you do."
4,Matheson's Romantic Fantasy is Better as a Movie,"This is one of the few examples of a book that is not really as good as the movie. Where the book has its strengths is in the depiction of the inner mind of Richard Collier before he travels back in time. It is dark, brooding, and baroquely detailed when Collier is at the Hotel Del Coronado. (Which by the way is cool but not nearly as majestic as the Grand Hotel Mackinaw Island.)If you like the movie, you will enjoy the book, but for different reasons. The book is good, but the movie is a classic."
3,Not as good as....,"Having read Jack Finney's ""Time and Again"" before reading this, I was more than a little disappointed with ""Somewhere in Time."" It took far too long for the author to set up the premise, and the actual romance takes place over two days. The book would have been much improved if Matheson could have come to the crux sooner and more convincing if he had given more details on the relationship between the three main characters. This is one of the rare cases where the movie was actually better than the book. Of course, Jane Seymour's beauty may have had something to do with that. If a reader is going to read one time travel romance, stick with Finney's novel. It is a truly wonderful tale and far more creative."
3,A true love story,The book made sense for time travel and it could be logical for people who don't. The story line was believable. The movie was written better and the production was great. But the movie had a lot of unanswered question. Still the book and the movie is good for us who know you can't really do time travel but good to escape to.
4,Somewhere in Time,"Loved the movie, so I thought the book would be interesting. It was interesting. I didn't give it 5 stars, because I didn't like the last 2 pages written by the brother. Check them out AFTER you read the book."
3,Where it All Began,"Having seen the movie before reading the book, the book disappointed me as the movie has turned out to be my favorite of all time. The reason I bought the book after the movie is that I wanted to see what the differences were. I've watched the movie hundreds of times but have read the book only once! Elise in my mind is Jane Seymour and I cannot separate her from the Elise character. Perhaps had I read the book first and then seen the movie I would have a different impression. The book and the movie differ in many respects and if you like the book you will love the movie!"
4,"Time travel, romance, and a great story",A rich story about a man obsessed with a picture of a turn-of-the-century actress and his desire to return to that era;to say more would be giving away the plot of this absorbing novel. A rich love story with a stunning ending.
3,Quite different from the movie,"It was a bit disappointing, I would have liked more comparisons between the modern day life the man was used to and the past he was visiting. It also was a bit more sexually explicit than I expected, but not raunchy or anything."
4,Wonderful Time-Travel Story,"If you are a fan of time-travel, you will love this book. This is the same author that wrote I Am Legend (another great novel, but not about time-travel). The book does have its flaws, but overall it is a great story worth checking out."
4,A Movie Made This Story,"SOMEWHERE IN TIME by Richard Matheson was made memorable because of the movie, which left out a very slow beginning in the book. Time travel has been over worked today, but when SOMEWHERE IN TIME was published it was a new and delightful idea.Richard Collier falls in love with an actress from the past and manages to spend one night with her before returning to his own time to die. A great love story, that is well told except for the editoral comments of his brother.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
3,The legend of Somewhere In Time,"At first,I've heard Somewhere In Time from an American film,I was only 7 0r 8 years old. 10 years passed by,I still remember this title,and I can find an original book to keep Somewhere In Time as my legendary memento.I'm also grateful that this legend is republished again in my generation."
1,Dangerous,"I suffered severe side effects from taking MSM. My stool changed color, lost weight, and my vision, sense of smell, and hearing became distorted. If you look at the information on the web it says that MSM is completely safe, however most nutritional supplements are not subject to rigorous study to determine their safety. Thus, the paucity of data with respect to the long-term safety of MSM. According to my M.D, MSM acts to suppress amino acid production in one's body, and is extremely unsafe for that reason. As amino acids are essential for nervous system function, etc. I had to withdraw from a semester of college due to taking MSM. I would highly recommend not taking it, and if you do using extremely low dosages and consulting with your M.D first. As taking it is not like taking a multi-vitamin. Which I did not know to my great regret."
4,Not bad.,"This product gave me a severe headache and a complete tired body for one whole day, which means it was actually working right. My only mistake was taking high doses of 2000 mg daily as a start and led to suddent flushout of toxins in the body that led to my headache and tiredness. Now I don't have any of these and still on 2g dose."
2,Says on the bottle Pure MSM,"The bottle says Pure MSM in big letters, but below this is says ""99% pure No Heavy Metals! in red. I thought I was buying pure MSM. This brand does not pass the sink test. When I put the powder from the capsule in warm water, it dissolves slowly, but the water is cloudy. I have only been using it for three days, so I don't know if it will help with joint pain or not. Why doesn't TriMedica put in big letters, 99% pure. 99% is not 100. Hope I didn't waste my money. Make sure if you are going to buy MSM make sure you read the whole label. When I typed in 100% pure MSM, this TriMedica MSM came up. I was told pure MSM is what I need, not 99%. TriMedica didn't lie, it says on the bottle 99% pure; they just put that in smaller letters."
1,"Added ""unknown"" filler that does not pass the MSM sink test","Pure MSM should sink to the bottom when added to a glass of water, this fails the test miserably, what ever is left floating on the water is NOT pure MSM as described.I should have tested BEFORE I started taking it, I didn't and a week into it I FELT ILL, I did the float test and I have no clue what is floating around but it aint MSM, do yourself a favor, give this a miss."
4,Very good,"I have seen this movie before and loved the passion of Antonio to the dance which he portrays so well. The story of ""poor kids"" being helped out is kinda old, but the movie is well made. And it has Banderas in it. What else can you wish for? ;)"
4,I love the story line,I love the dance and story line in this movie and I love Antonio Banderas he is aswesome in this movie beside pussy n boots
3,Antonio Who?,Yes I know the women will whoo over Antonio but I just didn't see this as a Banderas movie. It was a good movie the story was there but it just wasn't an Antonio Banderas film to me. On the other hand If your married your wives will not be upset to get this as a gift.
4,Arrived as promised,Arrived quickly and great for young teens who might be considering whether to dance or not...very motivating.
5,Take the Lead,"I absolutely love this movie, my husband and I have watched it a million times already, the cast, story, and the music is just superb. It deserves an academy award.I just wish in DVD format, we can go directly to the movie, rather than having to fast forward through several advertisements.Love Pierre Dulaine, Antonio Banderas, Alfre Woodwart and all the ""Dungeoun Kids"".DVD is good condition.Thank you."
5,I liked it,"Antonio Banderas made Take the Lead such a good movie. No question about it. His character was great. It's about him able to take a bunch of trouble maker teens and give them something to believe in, which allows the teens to want to dance and continue dancing until they get really good and ready for the competition at the end.It was a good movie because Antonio Banderas's character was nice and calm and very intelligent, and was able to prove the people wrong who didn't believe he'd be able to help troubled teens. Sure, this is basically a sports movie about no-talented high school dropouts who originally hate everyone and everything, and turn them into talented believers (with a happy ending) but it's still worth watching."
4,Get Up and Dance!!!,"This one had me, my wife (who NEVER dances in public) and my son up on our feet, shakin' our groove things in my living room. I loved it! It was the perfect ""date"" movie, without having to go out to some theater, get a baby-sitter, etc. It had everything: great music (both modern and classic) funny story-lines, and even sad story-lines which helped us learn about the characters.Some folks are complaining about the music, and the fact that it didn't treat respect in the right light. Agreed. I thought the ending, where the two dudes were tag teaming the cute brunette for the $5,000 prize was unbelievable, and would not have been allowed. Also, if this was a such a closed contest, how did outsiders even be allowed to enter? And where did this ""teacher"" get all the money for their entry fees?But ignoring all that, it really was a great movie. The extras were nice. I love when we learn about the young actors in movies. This DVD does not disappoint.MC White said: Check it out!!!"
3,Likeable attempt to bring ballroom dance to the high-school crowd,"So this movie is based on the life of Pierre Dulaine, who founded the dance program featured in ""Mad Hot Ballroom"". It's a pleasant enough spin on the ""To Sir With Love"" genre of ""innovative teacher gets angry loser kids to soften up and succeed through____"". Banderas is personable in the role and can certainly dance, while the gaggle of misfit kids seem well-cast. I particularly liked Dante Basco , channelling a teen John Leguizamo. The movie would have become a really good one if, as others pointed out, they really attempted to remix hip-hop and ballroom in the music and in key dance sequences. The energy is there but the dance scenes are never more than just ""okay"". The exception is the ""threesome tango"" that manages to be hot, slightly kinky and pretty exciting. Like another poster upthread, the audience I was watching the movie with erupted into spontaneous applause at the end of that number."
2,2 1/2 Stars: The Two Step,"Nothing new or earth-shaking here: just a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. Antonio Banderas plays a professional ballroom dancer now dance teacher who decides to enlighten/encourage a group of high school perennial detentioners by way of teaching them the art of ballroom dance. He hopes to teach them to trust/respect and depend on each other while doing the Viennese waltz. At first the kids scoff then they get into it.Based on the true story of Pierre Dulaine, ""Take the Lead"" is another installment in our growing fascination with Ballroom Dancing. It is neither worse than ""Dancing With The Stars"" nor better than the recent ""Mad Hot Ballroom."" What it is, is slightly amusing when it stays in the dance training mode and silly and obvious when it strays into social comment."
5,Nice,"Take the lead DVD - just as described, loved the movie, nice to still have it- for repeat watching great buy"
3,OK Moves,"Even for a ""dance movie,"" Take the Lead is a little silly, but if you sit down to watch it without too many expectations, it provides with a decent amount of entertaining. Antonio Banderas is cute as a teacher who decides to use ballroom to inspire troubled students in a public school, and the competition scene with the three dancers is absolutely stunning--that alone is worth the rental price."
3,Not my favorite,I am a fan of dance movies. I can watch them over and over again. This one is OK but not my favorite. The bonus features wereinteresting though.
3,dance!,"It's a teenage dance movie, which I saw on my flight from Tokyo/Narita to Guangzhou. It stars Antonio Banderas, who reminds us once again that he really can dance very well. He plays a ballroom dancer, who starts a program for inner-city kids to teach them how to dance. He enters the kids in a city ballroom competition. Along the way, the kids learn practical life lessons, and how to overcome the ""bad sides"" of their lives and living conditions. Very predictable, in other words. But, good dancing is to be had here."
4,Magical,"This is another movie where an adult finds a creative way to intervene in the lives of troubled inner-city youths to teach them dignity, respect, and a little ballroom dancing. Antonio Banderas did a fantastic job in this film with a great mix of meekness and toughness. The magical part was not necessarily the plot (although it was touching) but how Banderas found the $200 entry fee for each of the couples in the competition, plus dresses/tuxes for them, and how the authority figures do not call security to remove the interlopers at the cotillion nor at the competition when they hijack the sound system. At 2 hours long, its about 15 minutes too long, but is enjoyable overall."
3,Take The Lead,"Take The Lead is an inspiring and joyful film. The idea that Ballroom dancing can give inner city students something to do, something to hope for and a goal to reach is most gratifying, as I'm sure it must be for all parents and teachers as well."
5,I love this movie,I love this movie.My family like it. While it teachs dance it also teaches where to put your anger and how todeal with a hard life. surprisingly this moviemotivated my sister to push through school without asmany fights. Many of my friends enojyed it. i resonally like based on a true story movies.
3,Dancing & Antonio - Ahhhh,Formulaic but still a good story about affecting the lives of students via art of some sort. It also shows that kids respond to someone who shows some care and concern for them. You get to watch Antonio Banderas and some good dancing. What's the down side?
3,Visually disppointing,"Out of all the Phish concert DVDs out there, I bought this one based on the comments that this one was the best as far as capturing the band's light show (which was a highlight at the one concert I've been fortunate to attend). So while considerations whether this is the band's best performance or the best set list, etc., are largely lost on me, I have to simply observe that close-ups of Trey swaying back and forth while soloing loses interest for me after not too long and misses the larger sensory impact that I think the band's live show offers. Hopefully, I'll eventually find a video document that better captures the sum of Phish's live performance."
2,Meh,Not a super exciting Phish show overall. A few good songs and jams. Bottom line- don't waste your money unless you are trying to add to your collection.
5,A terrific service to women AND men,"It's about time someone said what Dr. Northrup is saying. She really ""tels it like it is"" or better yet "" should be."" You really learn the needed elements for creating health rather than just letting it happen. Everyone should view this video."
1,wrong size,I ordered these gloves and was never asked a size. I didn't realize they would sell only mediums. I e-mailed ace immediatly right after the order using the email on amazons web page. They didn't return it. I emailed them again the next day and got nothing after that I got an email confirmation that they shipped me medium gloves and a phone number. I talked to someone who just wanted to blame me. He said I never sent any emails and said its my fault for not being able to read model numbers. I wounldn't order from them again. There are to many other options.
1,Poop,"I had to get this book for a ridiculously racially prejudiced liberal studies ""cultural diversity"" course that essentially chanted ""down with white devil"" the whole time. I call shenanigans!"
4,great replacement,Great replacement. Used it in my 2006 Dodge 2500 mega cab. yes it works and fits fine. Only reason I gave it a 4 star rather then 5 is because on the first two settings it has a wineding sound that is anoying.
4,My daughter's favorite.,"This series is my daughter's favorite. She is 2 years old, this is the one that keeps her attention the longest. As a mother, I like the bright colors, the voices are calming, the action is perfect for little ones, and it makes my daughter laugh."
2,Low qualty of screen,"I dont know much about digital things, but it is very sandy. Maybe it is copied from video tapes to dvd.My boy is still watching, but if i knew this low quality, i would never buy this."
5,WONDERFUL,MY 5 YEAR OLD SON LOVES THE DOODLEBOPS. HE LOVES TO SING AND DANCE TO THEM. NEVER GETS TIRED OF THEM. I'VE BOUGHT THIS ITEM TWICE BECAUSE HE PLAYS IT SO MUCH IT GOT WORN OUT. GREAT BUY.
5,Thomas funpack,"Great little package, very happy with the pack, Great company to deal with. I'm happy, happy, happy."
4,Barney Baby,Barney Family Fun PackMy grand-daughter loves these. She dances and sings swaying to the music. It is calming to a one-year little princess!
4,unanswered questions,"i have gotten both issues with rita. However, I wanted to know what her measurements were at that time. She had a very good figure and i have tried many different ways to find out. If you can find them , i would appreciate it."
4,Buy both battery and charger,"Headsup, if you only need a battery, and you don't have the charger, I suggest you buy both battery and charger. You will not be able to use the camera, without charging the battery first. I was disappointed when I finally read the battery instructions. Now I have to wait another few weeks to take pictures. However, I do recommend the battery if you need it. I think it's a good idea to have a charger, then having to buy batteries every week. These cameras use up battery power a lot more, than throw aways or older model cameras. I hope in my case, after all is purchased, there are no more surprises :)"
4,Great camera battary,Work fine had it for more then a year now you can't tell which one you using the original or this one
1,Buyer Beware!,This battery will NOT run the DMC-FZ40; is rejected by the camera. I was led to believe this was a compatible battery. It is NOT.
1,Wrong Model Type for the camera that i bought,I bought the wrong model compatible with my Camera. Unfortunately the goods have been sent to Egypt and I'm stuck with it!
2,Do not belive the advertisement !,"I ordered this battery on Jan.,21, 09 and I received it today. Unfortunately the Amazon advertisement is misleading because I received a different product that one depicted and ordered by myself. It has only 970mAh instead of 1000mAh as the original battery and as it is advertised by Amazon. I am very disapointed for the misleading and of course of the product.I would not advise to buy this battery, because it is not original."
5,"Simply, the same!","Hi everyoneThis replacement battery is the exactly the same with the original we have with the camera. I cant understand others saying: ""the replacement is better/worse than the original one"" !!! exactly the same manufacturer with the same specification. Maybe, some people are buying this after a while of using their original ones, so it might look better as it would be ""new"" compared to the one they are using.I have a TZ3, actually it is a high demanding camera, I believe buying another one is mandatory for this camera if you dont want to run out of power.I wish if Panasonic made a more powerful battery for this camera."
5,Great Product,"Bought this battery for my Lumix DMC-TZ50. It lasted three days on vacation, before needing recharging. It pays to buy the manufacturers battery."
4,Panasonic lithium ion battery,"This battery seems to be good, but it did not arrive in retail packaing as advertised so I do not know if it is genuine Panasonic or a knock-off. So far it seems to charge OK but I have not had it long enough to see how long it holds a charge or how it handles pictures. The shipping charges were excessive probably to make up for the lower sales price. I was not very pleased with the false advertising."
4,Great Battery,I bought 2 for my DMC-TZ5 and they work great. and you can't beat the price Amazon has these for. Get them now!!!. They are same as you get in the box when you buy a camera.
1,hose does not work as I thought,this hose is not compatable with the olympian 5500 rv grill. The quick disconnect fittings are not the same size.
2,Tropic-Marin Thermometer,"This Tropic Marin themometer reads 2 degrees (Farenheit) low when compared to four other thermometers (two of the others are digital).I bought this thermometer new last week. It is in good condition (not broken, cracked, dropped, abused, etc.). The red alcohol column is intact (no bubbles). Two other aquarium thermometers (one digital) located in my aquarium read near 77 degrees F, while the new Tropic Marin thermometer reads near 75 degrees. In another comparison, two (human) body temperature thermometers (one digital), placed in my mouth, both registered 98.4 degrees while the Tropic Marin reads about 96.5 degrees."
1,LEMON -- don't buy,"The thermometer arrived with a gap in the liquid indicator as often happens. Unfortunately, the glass column has a bend in it between the bulb and the main body of the thermometer. This makes reuniting the liquid impossible as the gap becomes hung up there.The suggested ice water method does not work as it is not cold enough to draw all the liquid dye into the bulb. If you shake the thermometer as advised, the beads in the bulb will break the glass. I have repaired thermometer problems many times when I worked in a laboratory, but this was a lost cause. The thermometer also lacks an expansion bulb at the top, so heating to eliminate the gap will burst the glass.I now suspect the temperature inaccuracies described in the other reviews were due to gaps in the column that were not noticed."
4,Great for beginners,"This kit is wonderful for those who are just starting to learn Spanish. The CDs are very clear and easy to understand and they follow the book to make learning simple. Also, the chapters cover useful information for those who wish to learn enough Spanish to be able to communicate/understand the basics."
2,Difficult to learn,"This set is no different than most language courses. It starts out with pronounciations of the alphabets; however, some of these alphabets there were pronounced on CD are not on the list. Another thing is that the conversations of each chapter is so short and fast. I don't think this is intended for someone has not a clue about Spanish. I do pick up phrases and vocabularies here and there through out the chapters, but the layout is so incoherent it's hard to feel confident. I would suggest that you go pick up a REAL true beginner's Spanish book that slowly teaches you from the basics and simple sentence structures. And then you can tackle this intermidiate-advanced Latin Spanish course."
4,Variants must be considered,"This is a good course in general, I agree. The story at the end of a chapter makes it more interesting. My students like it. I am a Costarican and teach our language to foreigners for holidays and business. I find that I have to complement this course with quite a lot in the way of local expressions and cultural information applicable to Costa Rica. This course appears to have Mexico in mind mainly, but there are other countries in Central America. They need to be catered for too."
5,My son loves his Razor!,My 5 year old son loves his Razor. He was so excited when he saw it and rode it immediately. I love the lime green color too. It's perfect and from what I hear will last a pretty long time.
5,Granddaughters loved the scooters,"Bought a pink razor scooter for each of our two granddaughters (ages 7 & 5) for Christmas.They both squeeled when they opened their packages.Shortly they were zooming around our driveway having a lot of fun.When they returned home, their mother said they were riding them in their drivewayas well. The purchase apparently was a good one!"
5,great fun,"My two kid's age's 6 & 7 have not put these down sence santa brought them home. (wink wink) great fun and lots of exercise. So small and compact I dont even mind them ridding them in the house. Gerat product Great shipping, Thank's a BUNCH!!"
2,Fell apart in 3 days,I got this for my 5 y/o son for his birthday. He used it three times and parts starting falling out. The scooter is not able to lock closed or open. I am disappointed.
5,Razor scooter review,"Hello! I received the product in damaged and opened packaging. I do understand that this can happen in transport. However, in all my ordering time this is the first time receiving something in this condition. The actual product box was also banged up but the scooter itself is OK. I use it to keep up with my kids and it takes me down the path just fine. I do love the ease and convience of Amazon!Kristi"
3,Pretty good scooter,"I ordered 4 of these scooters, 2 out of 4 arrived defective. One of the scooters arrived without the latch needed to tighten and loosen the handle bars so you can adjust the height. Another scooter arrived and the right handle bar wouldn't fit into the slot so I had to bang it in with a hammer, its now stuck. This scooter is good for what its worth, but you can get them cheaper at Walmart or Target. You cant ride over any speed bumps or you will get stopped by it because the floor to scooter distance is short. And the littlest pebbles can make you crash."
5,Well worth the money,"Our kids received one each from their grandparents and want to ride everyday. I must admit that I am under the weight limitation and I am thoroughly enjoying the Razor myself ... when our son will share his and ride his bike instead.No parent will be disappointed with this gift for kids and if you're under 143lbs, for yourself as well."
2,Broken already!,"I bought this for my daughter and it is already broken. I asked her wehat happen and she said "" I was just riding it and it stopped turning"".....something inside the base of the handle bars has shifted out of place and she can no longer ride it :( we can try to fix it I suppose but after having the scooter for 11 days we should NOT have to be fixing it."
3,grandsons scooter,I purchased the razor scooters and they have functioned pretty good. They have had minor problems like some loose screws and the folding mechanism sometimes sticks but all in all my grandson is enjoying his scooter.
3,Broke the first day,I bought this for my nephew after reading all of the good reviews. He rode it three times and the last time he came back with the lock to the handlebars broken off. He said he fell down and it broke. I thought something built for kids would last longer than three rides. Would not recommed to others.
5,Just as expected,"The best part about ordering this scooter for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas was all the color choices! We almost bought a red one at a local store (the only color available) but when we saw they had green (her favorite) here, it was a done deal! Great quality and durability...as we expected! Highly recommended."
3,okay,It is okay. I bought it for commuting to school. It is not too small for me but I feel little uncomfortable riding this. (I am college student) but its okay.
4,Razor scooter,Awesome toy for a four year old boy! My son is still trying to master it but I think with a little more practice he will get there.
3,Get an A or pro instead,This is a fairly good scooter but it has two problems. By the way this is my moms account I'm actually a guy but that isn't all that important. First and formost it has a wheelie bar making tailwhips and many other tricks twice as dangerous. If anybody knows the point of them please feel free to tell me. Also it isn't that sturdy and I broke mine jumping a gap. If your seriosly into scootering get the pro model and if you just hate wheelie bars like me get the A model.Razor Pro Model Kick Scooter (Clear or Red)
4,great fun,I bought a scooter for each of my grand-daughters. They are 5 and 7. They both love them. We take them to a park or just go for a walk with the kids using the scooters. They like them better than walking and they are easier to store or take in the car then bikes.
5,"Great price, brand new!","Just as advertised, brand new! Great price and my niece, 6 or 7 when I bought it, still loves it!"
5,Sick Scooter,"I got this scooter when I was 5 and I loved it. Over my life time I've probably ridden that thing for over a hundred miles total, mabye even two hundred. But it only has two smooth terains, concrete and wood. It always had it's place in my heart until it was stolen when some genius of a friend thought it would be a good idea to leave it out in the middle of the night. But while I still had it, it was a ton of fun."
5,Awesome!,"These scooters are great, this is the forth one I have brought. I brought the first for my 4yr old daughter and the others for my neices. They are durable, and very portable as the handle folds flat. They are now used by my 3yr old, my 200lb+ husband and up to and including my 63yr father.I will be buying more as the rest of my family - friends kids get to 3-4yrs of age, as the scooters are so durable/adjustable for age and height, that none will be passed down, only worn out over time."
4,Just what my son wanted!,Delivery was quick and I got what I paid for! The description was on Target and it arrived well before Christmas..
4,It's a razor,Anyone with kids has probably gone through a few of these. I picked this up on sale for $19.00 during the holidays and it is your classic well built and useable razor scooter.
5,COOL SCOOTER!,"BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND SHE IS STILL USING IT, SO THAT SAYS IT ALL IN MY OPINION. MOST CHRISTMAS GIFTS I GET HER GET USED AND DISCARDED AFTER ABOUT A WEEK."
5,Scooter,I bought it for My Goddaughters birthday She told me I made her 5th Birthday GREAT She has no stopped rideing it She lives in Floridaso she is getting alot of use out of it
4,Sturdy and fast,Our children love their scooters and this model is compact for easy storage. It is sturdy and safe to boot!
4,such a nice scooter,"I recently bought one of these for my just turned 6 year old. He is flying around all over the place on it, and loving every second of it. It even helped with his balance while learning to ride his bike without training wheels. Definitely worth it!"
4,My son loves it !,I got the scooter for my 5 year son for his birthday and he just loves it. It is sturdy and stable.Only con: A little tricky to fold and unfold it.
4,Great fun,Easy to put together and the kids love it. Wish it had a way to prop it up when not in use. Otherewise - great product.
4,scooter,"My daughter was very pleased nwith her scooter the only compliant I have that the black razor cover things didn't stay on, but it still is a nice product."
5,No more shoulders!,"I'm soo glad I got this for my 3 1/2 year old. He's fist scooter was Radio Flyer (what a waste of money). It was too slow and difficult for my son to operate, after 10 minutes of riding it he would say ""pick me up"". But now, with the razor, he just goes, it's fast and he loves it. He does get tired but doesn't asked to be picked up. Be careful carrying it, it cut my leg few times, but you'll survive."
3,ok,"This is my son's second scooter-same model as before. It is moderatly durable if it is going to be well taken care of. My son leaves it out in the yard all year long. It seems it has a life span of a year. The reason I did not get the upgraded model was that children grow so quick. And also one month my son will love his skateboard, the next a scooter and then the bike, so there is no need to spend a lot of money if it is used for a short period of time. He likes it just fine."
4,Grandson likes his kick scooter,"We bought this kick scooter for out grandson who just had his 7th birthday. He is enjoying it. His older sisters each have their own scooter, so he feels included when he can use his too. The Razor scooters are great gifts for grandchildren - male and female."
4,"okay for kids, not enough for an adult","I purchased this for myself as I needed a scooter to accompany my son on rides through the park. It looks good and is perfect for a child but the handlebars are too short to accomodate my 5'6"" frame. I felt that this wasn't made clear in the product information. My son loves it so we traded."
3,Great scooter- if you read the weight limit before buying it!,"This scooter looks and feels quite nice. I was so happy to be getting a scooter- I have a miserable physical condition and I knew a scooter would help me get from place to place easier and still get some exercise. But I failed to read the weight limit before buying it. I figured, what's 50 lbs over? It's supposed to be a good strong piece of equipment. I've had it several days now and it is already getting looser every time I ride it. Sure it's fun and all that and I really enjoy it. But I don't want it to fall apart under me while going down a hill or something. The extra few bucks for the pro model is worth it, with the capacity to hold up to 220lbs safely. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE OVER AT LEAST 150 LBS! You will regret it =/"
2,used?!,"Although i'm not completely disappointed since i know my cousins will appreciate scooters for christmas, the items arrived with scratches although they were not supposed to be used. Fast shipping though!!"
4,Good for children,"I bought a black one and a blue one for my little siblings, who are 4 and 6. It's good for children up to 10. They really love it. It doesn't take too much balancing and there's no learning curve, like there is for a bike, so when they go to the park/playground, they won't get bored. The blue color is really nice. The ability to fold it and put it away after they're done makes it that much better."
1,defective,"The scooter was in fine condition when it came but after taking it out of the box and unfolding it, I found that it was defective. It would not fold back into the position it was stored in, which meant it had to be sent back but was made difficult with its awkward shape."
5,o man i wish...,this is a good scooter you have to admit but i used to have a viper brand scooter and it was fast!! but it got stolein i hate people who do that i wish i had my viper brand scooter back from 2000 i tryed to find it online but they dont sell any i wish i knew where my dad got it he died in 2001 ok i just wonder if they had it here but they dont o man.
5,Great Scooter for Kids!!,"My 5 year old is a whiz on his big brother's scooter, but sharing one scooter, not so much! The scooter is great! It rides fast and he has great control and rides all over the neighborhood. It is super all the way around. He has used it all over since Christmas!!"
4,just perfect for my grandson,This is a great way to burn off a little of the energy that five and a half year olds have an abundance of. Great to build balance and coordination and keep them moving away from the TV. Even Grandpa can do it!!
4,"great scooter, great price","Got this scooter for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas, so I can't comment on how well it holds up, but so far it seems very sturdy. My daughter is on the small side, so she should get a lot of use out of it. The color is very bright pink and the scooter is VERY girly, perfect for a girly girl. My daughter had never ridden a 2 wheeled scooter before, but she got her balance very quickly and was riding with confidence around the neighborhood within an hour. A great purchase!"
5,Scooter,"These are great for 5 year olds, not for 7 or 8. They are sturdy and very easy to put up and down."
4,good value,"this razor scooter performed very well. just doesn't have all the extras, only adjust to a couple of hights etc."
5,Good starter scooter.,Not all the bells and whistles as some of the others. But it's a great starter scooter. Solid. Well constructed.
5,5 year old daughter loves it!!,"My daughter received this item as a Christmas gift from her grandma. It was, by far, her favorite gift! She rode it all day on Christmas and has not stopped since. A great purchase for an active kid!"
5,GREAT,"This was my 6 year old daughter's favorite Christmas present. It's great. It's so easy to fold up and throw in the back of the car. I can't wait for my 3 year old to get big enough for one, we'll definately buy another when he does."
1,Dissapointing,"This is a very small, not average sized Razor. I had bought one a few years ago for my daughter and she still rides & loves it. I bought this one for my 6 year old boy, thinking it was the same size. He can't even get both feet on the deck. I do not recommend this razor for anyone older than 4."
1,Can't read instructions,Was shipped to my home instead of desired address. Ended up mailing myself and now lost somewhere in snail mail land.
4,Great scooter,My daughter loves her scooter!!! She is able to adjust the bars according to her height and is easy to put away in her room. I highly recommend this scooter.
5,My kid loves it,"I don't know if a review is required for this, but doing it any ways. My kid loves it and can't get enough of it. Its pretty looking too."
3,"Flimsy streamers,Cheap bell","This is the 3rd Razor A Kick Scooter that I have purchased, in as many years, so, obviously, I like the product. However, with this particular scooter ( I purchased two), the big attraction was the added features, of the bell and streamers. I was very disappointed that they were both cheap, and not very functional (streamers were as flimsy, as paper, and started shedding, right away,out of the box. The bell was no better...hard to make a ring, with the little plastic knocker, on the tiny little bell)...I would have preferred paying a little more, for quality, durable, functional, added features. I was very pleased with the color, since one girl wants pink, and the other purple, and this color satisfied both. Just, give us a better bell and sturdier, heavier plastic, streamers."
5,Razor Scooter,"The Razor has been the most durable of all scooters we've owned. I mistakenly bought another brand on sale ... and it was falling apart and bent within a few days. My son bought a Razor on sale ... and has done all kinds of stunts on it without a bend, break or loose wheel. Great deal, ... and well made!"
1,Cheap materials = cheap product,I've bought this scooter for my niece who's used it exactly four times before parts start falling apart. The saying you get what you pay for just never fails. I'd much rather pay more for better quality than go through the hassle of returning one item & buying another one. Sigh.
5,Wheee!,"This has proven to be a very convenient means of travel for those without a car. As an adult, but young at heart, I use it to go short distances in my neighborhood (Queens, NY) and back and forth from the train. Light in weight and easy to fold, it comfortably fits in my backpack. I recommend it not only to children as a toy, but to shorter (handle bars go to 35 inches in height) adults who enjoy walking but sometimes have time constraints that require a glide!"
4,Razor Scooter!!,THis scooter is great to ride by on. Its affordable and very sturdy. Easy to use and portable.Wheels can be a little flimsy but not really. Very good made scooter. very recomended!!
5,Sharp Looking,Sharp looking scooter. Bought for my granddaughter and she is enjoying it. Would recommend buying from Amazon.
1,Poor quality and build; will not last,"Last Christmas I bought 4 of these for my kids. By the summer, all 4 were falling apart, and my kids aren't particularly hard on toys."
5,Good Value for the Money,"Bought this for our 4 year old, he loves it! Worth the $30 it costed. Easy fold up and easy to ride."
2,ehh,This product is cheap for a reason. It breaks easily and becomes jammed without fail constantly. The seller first sent me a broken one and i got that one replaced but again it gets messed up all the time with the slightest use.
1,this scooter lasted me 4 months,This is a very bad scooter compared to the old razors. The old razors were much lighter and stronger. After 4 months of hard riding it started to develope shake (not from the headset) and rode very low to the ground.
2,not a good option for a scooter for a 3 year old,"i did some research on scooters for my 3 year old. she had been borrowing the other kids mini-kick scooters in the neighborhood. i discovered the mini-kick was $83!!! surely i could get a cheaper option, right?"
4,Not what I remembered.,"I remember getting a Razor scooter 8 years ago for my birthday and loving it. When I ordered this one I saw that it came with black plastic around the joints and the back wheel. The old ones were all aluminum and felt much more sturdy. I'm sure this would be great for a younger kid, say 5-13, but this just doesn't cut it for a 6' 1'' guy, even though I am a beanpole. This is more of a toy than a transportation device. I'll be ordering the Pro edition and giving this to someone that can use it."
4,razor scooter,We bought this for my 8 year old. She's been zipping around and doing stunts since it arrive. Her little sister (6) loves it too.
5,Great gifts for my boys,"Great product. I purchased two of them for my boys, and they really love it. Made pretty strong and can be folded easily. It was really easy and fast to put together for my sons. No tools requiered."
4,Great Razor! Good for the price.,"My 6 and half year old daughter is absolutely loveling the Razor. It is very easy to handle and adjust. However, it would be great if the foot board would have been a little bigger."
5,love this scooter,Bought this as a replacement for a Razor that got stolen. No complaints. My six-year old rides it to school everyday. And I love that we were able to get it in green--his favorite color!
4,My daughter loves this scooter!...,My wife and I bought this same scooter [actually from Target] for my 6 year old daughter and it's pretty easy to open up and fold down to carry. My daughter didn't have any prior experience riding scooters and she is catching on pretty quickly.You may have to tighten scooter with a [metric]Allen wrench which did not come in our box.
4,Great Scooter,My son just loves this scooter. It is durable but it can stick a tiny bit when trying to open it.
2,no way for tricks,this is a horrid scooter for tricks! do not be fooled by the happy kids doing tricks! i did a few four stairs and the folding mechanisim broke very promptley!
5,Proud Grandpa,My Grandaughter tells me that she is very pleased with the birthday gift she received from me through Amazon which makes me proud and happy.Thanks Amazon!
5,Razor kick scooter for granddaughter,Our granddaughter really likes her scooter which we gave her for Christmas. I was really pleased that we received it within a few days. We could not find a pink one in the stores. We bought her sister a red one and wanted a different color for her sister and pink is her favorite. Both girls are having a lot of fun with their razor kick scooters.
5,THE BEST SCOOTER EVER,"this is the best scooter because,its really smooth and i never get off of it.i LOVE IT and you can balance so easy anyone can do it.mosly because of the price its really CHEAP."
5,By Little Girl Loves This One,"Thank God Razor makes this scooter in PURPLE! My 4 year old daughter has wanted one of these for 2 years, but was obviously too small for one. She has seen other kids with these and she is enjoying it to the fullest. My son has had his for 2 years and it's held up great."
5,Cough up the money and $$BUY THIS SCOOTER!!!!!!!$$!,I like this scooter because it looks great and it's faster than the other scooters! I got this for Christmas and it is a great sport toy! In my opinion the other kick scooters are slower than Razor kick scooters! If your looking for a scooter and you can't think of which one to buy I have the perfect solution! Go and get a Razor Kick Scooter!
5,Great little scooter,"My kids just love this inexpensive little scooter. We have another one at home, which has been used for years. We've had other scooters, but have found the Razor brand to be the most stable and reliable."
4,A scooter for the younger ages,"This is a great scooter for riding around town and the everyday use. It is light and easy to ride on. If your looking for a scooter that you want to just ride then it's great for you. Although people use scooters to ride around, another popular use for them is to do tricks on. This scooter is good for riding but I would not use it to do tricks on. I have had this scooter since I was a very young age and it has survived around 6 years. Unfortunately after a couple days of pretty simple tricks, the handlebars broke and were constantly folding back. If you want a scooter to do tricks on, try the ultra pro or the ultra pro lo, but if your a young kid between the ages of 5 and 10 and all you wanna use it for is as a transportation method, then this is the scooter for you!"
5,Great scooter.,Purchased for 4 year old grand daughters birthday. She loved it. Took her a few minutes to get used to it and then we couldn't get her in out of the rain.
4,My daughter loves this,"Bought this for my 3.5 year old for Christmas, and she loves it. Comes preassembled, breaks down to a compact size for transport, is lightweight, is easy to adjust the handlebar height when the time comes. Brake feature isn't being used yet, but once my daughter gets the hang of riding it, I'm sure she'll utilize. Overall a quality, well designed scooter. McFly would have loved this thing!"
3,You get what you pay for,"Plain and simple, this is a cheap scooter. Therefore, I didn't expect much from it. I am 24 and I use this in my office to ride around at work. It works fine for that. It doesn't work great on the street. It is a little small for someone that is 5' 11'', and yes, there are much better versions out there."
3,Just Ok,I had a a2 scooter for 1 or 2 years and finaly i broke it at the skate park. I got another A2 and I broke it too I got another A2 and now it isn't working either. If you take the scooter to the skate park get the pro model instead. It's only 15.00$ more.
3,Fun while it lasted,"My son really likes these things. I bought this on sale and he enjoyed it, but after awhile, the foam on the handle bars started coming off. We kept it in the garage (they are not inside toys, after all) so the elements may have been a factor. That's my primary complaint, though. It's a fun scooter, juts not very durable. My son is only 4 and has small hands, and wasn't particularly hard on this scooter."
3,needs more durable streamers in Sweet Pea,"Ok, I bought the Sweet Pea scooter for my little gal specifically for the sparkly streamers (she is a sparkly sweet pea). She and I waited anxiously for it to arrive. The box appeared on our doorstep today (very efficient shipping) and I quickly adjusted it for her size (easy task). She made it half way out the door for her maiden ride and one streamer got caught. It yanked off and broke apart into many shiny ribbons. She is 4 and there is a step at the door, so the pull on the streamer was minimal. I am lucky that she is such a good natured gal because she didn't miss a beat. She rode it happily down our sidewalk to show her friends the other streamer. I am the one who is bummed. Should I package the thing up to return it (a hassle, because I have four young children and a deployed husband)? Will the replacement be just as weak? Any suggestions?"
4,fast shipping!,I got the product at home in the mail way sooner than they said it would be here!My daughter loves this scooter(as does many children in our neighborhood).The only down side of the scooter is the lever to close up the scooter can sometimes take many trys.
5,great scooter!,"The price matches the high quality of this scooter. It's great for steering and really scooting far distances compared to other ones (lots of distance per scoot!). It folds flat so great to take in the van when on a trip (can scoot at a rest area or at family's house or vacation spot). Kids need exercise, fit it in wherever you can! It's great to have a choice of colors -- my daughter LOVES her pink and silver Razor!"
5,Daughter loves her Razor scooter,My daughter is 10 years old and really enjoys the Razor Kick a Scooter. It allows her to get some physical activity and it seems quite sturdy. She enjoys using it alone or with friends.
3,good product ...but for handle grip,this is good product. my 7 year old loves it...! except for the handle grip... it start developing a tear and can create risky grip for the rider...!
5,Great Scooter,"I ordered this for my daughter because she had to have pink. It's really cute, well made, and a great product. My daughter loves it! Razors last a long time....a good purchase for any child."
5,My daughter was thrilled!!!,Santa brought this scooter for my daughter and she was THRILLED!!! She had never seen a pink Razor scooter before. It was very easy to assemble and she was able to hop right on. It seems to be made very well and of sturdy materials.
5,Great color,Bought this for a community angel tree gift. I think any 10 year old boy would love it. My 10 year old girl picked it out. The quality appeared to be good.
3,Folding razor,"Looks Like a very well made product, but it folds only once. I thought this was a neat concept for transporting , EXCEPT the folding mechanism doesn""t function.Now I'm dealing with all the requirements to prove it is not working. A STRING OF PHOTOS ! The product with full photo, folding lever and model sticker. Along with the receipt.I now have trouble E-MAILING ALL OF THIS. HOPE TO FIGURE THIS OUT!"
5,Birthday gift,"Purchased the[Hello Kitty]Razor A Kick Scooter as a Birthday Gift for my Grandaugter's fifth Birthday. Quick delivery,and she loved it."
5,"A month in, it's great!","We bought this for our 4.5 year old son a month ago, and so far, he loves it and we haven't had any problems with it. Very sturdy and easily adjustable."
5,Cute & Sporty,"Bought this scooter for our 5 year old and she loves it. She's still learning to use it, but she's having a lot of fun with it. The splashy pink color and tassels on the handles were just perfect for our little girl who loves ""princessy"" looking stuff. Great buy!"
5,a big hit with the grandkids,"I bought two of these for my 7- and 5-year-old grandchildren to use when they come to visit. They were delighted with them and able to get the hang of it very quickly. I like the way they fold up and can be adapted to each child's size by raising or lowering the handlebars, so they should get many years' use out of them. They are also very quiet and smooth-running. I"
5,Scooter,Works fine. I haven't had a problem with it. I use it to get around for class. Keep in mind that it is meant for children though.
5,My son loves it...,"My son loves this scooter, he jumps very easy with it, he just turned 8 and carries this scooter everywhere with no problem, so it's not heavy for him. The scooter is worth the price. I recommend it."
2,What Happened To Quality?,"We owned a Razor scooter for several years before we purchased this one. That thing was indestructible and while it took serious abuse it functioned perfectly. We would have it to this day if it had not been stolen. We bought this one to replace the stolen one. From day one it would not fold properly and the handle would not lock fully. We sent it back and got a new one thinking we got a defective one. The second one had the same problem. Because my son uses the scooter almost daily to get to school and around the neighborhood, he did not want to send it back and wait for a replacement yet again. So, now we just never fold it up which, is a bit inconvenient living in a New York City apartment. My advice is go to a store with your kid and have them try several models, opening and closing them to see if they can do it consistently before making a purchase. C'mon Razor bring back the quality!"
4,great scooter for the $$,"bought this scooter for my 8-year-old daughter after looking in stores and reviewing prices online....the size is appropriate, the price was right, and the quality seems good....i am pleased with this purchase."
5,razor a kick scooter,"We bought this scooter for our son's 5th birthday. He loves it. It is very fast, and we love that it can be folded down and taken pretty much anywhere. The back break is also a nice feature. We would definitely recommend this product."
5,Great scooter,I bought this scooter for my 6 year old daughter. She loves it! I like the fact it is very durable and also attractive looking.
3,Razor Scooter,ok item but missing the tipping bar in the back. by the time you buy this additional must have part the scooter turns to be more expensive than Walmart. It bought my first one at Walmart for my other son and came complete for a great price. Thombs down!!
2,This thing sucks!,"I got this scooter when I was six, and after a week of riding it fell apart! One wheel fell off, and one of the grip thingys fell off. Also I fell on it and busted my lip.I would not reccommend this scooter for anyone."
2,Terrible Christmas day experience with this product,"I bought this product through Amazon for my nephew for Christmas. When he opened it on Christmas day, we realized it was damaged and it was very difficult to insert the handles, since one of the metallic tubes where the handles are inserted was bent. Of course, returning it was not an option, since my nephew had been waiting for this scooter for quite some time... I had to use a hammer and spend some time trying to assemble it. Totally unacceptable, it is definitely lack of Quality Control, I am sure it did not get damaged during the shipping, since the box where it came was very big and it was well packaged.I am not sure I will buy toys at Amazon again.... could it be that they sell irregular products????????"
5,perfect for the age!,"I got this for my 4 1/2 yr old son. It was easy for HIM to open and once we showed him how to unfold it he had no problems doing it himself. It folds nicely and the handles even fold in, it's stayed folded when not in use (which isn't very often). He LOVES this scooter! I wouldn't recommend it for a very large person, but my 7 1/2 yr old daughter has the same one (in pink of course) and it works very well for her. You won't find mommy and daddy out riding it (just out back where we can't be seen!), but again for the age we got them for they are perfect. Easy to operate, and seem sturdy enough for a 10 yr old. The foot area is smaller which makes it even better for younger kids. The price is great too! My kids had to buy their own with their allowance :)"
4,great price,I purchased this scooter for my daughter because the price was good. All what I was looking for was a good scooter and that is what I got. My only complaint is that when I received the scooter it was shipped in the razor box and the box was not even taped closed. The scooter itself was fine with no damage or scratches. I just wish they would have at least taped it closed.
4,Comparable to older Arch Enemy,"If you like older (ie pre-Angela Gossow) Arch Enemy, you will love this. This is Christopher Amott's side project with ex-AE drummer Peter Wildoer and other guests. Full of blistering solos and some acoustic and instrumental pieces, you can't go wrong here. The band shifted focus on their subsequent releases; they are power metal as opposed to melodic death, and are more laid back, with clean vocals, but this release is melodic death at its finest. My only complaint is it seems too short!"
5,madlib instrumentals,"I still haven't listened to Dilla Donuts yet, so I'm not sure how it compares to that album, but after listening to this CD for a few days I can definitley say this is a very dope instrumental album. These are some pretty straight forward beats, tight drum loops with memorable samples that flow together seamlessly. The last madlib album I bought was The Further Adventures of Lord Quas, and I was dissapointed with that CD, this one on the other hand exeeded my expectations. Perfect album to listen to during a smoke session."
3,NOT A MUSIC/LYRIC CD,"DISCLAIMER - If you are looking to purchase a CD with lyrics, full music tracks, etc then pass on this CD.Beat Konducta is a compilation of SAMPLES that Madlib created and if you are into sampling, producing, or freestyling then this CD is for you. Lots of tracks on this CD, but they are short. As a producer you can use the tracks and loop them on Pro Tools to create your own beats or have an emcee flow over the beats. If you don't appreciate samples, music production, incomplete tracks, etc this CD is not for you.You have to respect Madlib for sharing his samples/creations because he puts a lot of time and heart in his productions and I had to get this to hear what he has in the pipeline. I enjoyed some of the samples on this but would rate the CD as average since I like complete tracks to listen to. 3 out of 5 stars in my book. Respect to Madlib, Stones Throw, and Lootpack."
1,Alexander Scourby: The Scourge of the Intellect,"The mythology of Christianity, which, in short, is a conglomeration of pieces of many ancient Pagan religions, is just that: a MYTHOLOGY.Alexander Scourby treats this material as if it were fact, which would make this rendition laughable, if not so disgusting (perhaps if it were a short story, it would in fact be hilarious...I just don't know)."
4,Great book for a great program,"I learned a lot of cool tricks from the Playing With Fire web site, so I could hardly wait for the book to be published. The book is filled with a lot of great tips and tricks (many from the web site) for Fireworks users, both novice and pros. This is NOT a how-to-use Fireworks book, you already need to know the basics, but its tutorials are clear and easy to follow. I only wish that the book expanded a lot more over the original web site. Even so, I strongly recommend Playing With Fire."
2,Not Up To Par,"This book ""does not"" teach you Fireworks 4. I find that this book was an excuse for the author to show off the tricks that she learned along the way. The format is: someone sends in a ""how do I do this question"" and she answers the questions. But, it's very specific and advanced questions from the person that sent them in and not stuff that anyone wanting to learn about Fireworks would ask. The type of questions are from someone who's been working on it awhile and can't figure out how to do something tough. A ""Show and Tell"" book so-to-speak. Get the Fireworks 4 Bible if you want to learn Fireworks."
5,"Good product, good price.","This is a good product at a fair price. Everything needed for an outside power receptacle installation is included in the kit except the wire connecting the receptacle to the switch. The installation was relatively easy and well within the capability of anyone with a moderate amount of electrical savvy. The only hitch came when the electrical inspector said the pre-wired whip connecting the switch to the power panel had to be up-sized as it was overfilled with wire. However, after telling him that the switch was pre-wired and UL rated, he agreed to approve the installation. No other issues noted."
5,"Great kit, MADE IN USA!","Excellent kit, has everything you need to hook up your generator.Mine was made in USA, very well done.The electrician that installed it said I could not make better choice."
4,"Good quality, easy to install","Arrived in great shape and included plenty of information to install. I found it easy to follow the instructions, but I've also had some experience with electrical work around the house and the panel box. If you are new to electricity, this might be too much to take on yourself. That said, the product worked great. Another note, make sure you have space near your panel box to mount this switch. The metal conduit only gives you 12"" or so of room and isn't super flexible. The hardest part of the install for me was clearing a space and mounting it onto the wall. Fortunately, I had the tools on hand to accomplish this. Like many manuals the instructions merely say ""fasten"" the device to the wall. Sounds easy enough, but make sure you have fasteners (I used tapcon screws) and a decent drill/driver to get the job done. All in all, a good product and a great value."
5,Reliance controls,"Nice unit easy to install no problems. Just as decribed. Hooked right up to my Generators no Problems. Yours generators may not have the standard plug on your unit and may require you to go purchase one, Still no problems. Watch the video on youtube on how to install. . Fast shipping wonderful price."
5,Great Product,"The 6 circuit Reliance Transfer Switch is a great product. It's easy to install & provides the safety required by electrical inspectors. In addition, it's easy to use. There's no need to ever go into your main breaker box when you want to switch over to generator power - just flip the switches on the Reliance and you're power is back on."
4,Excellent &Necessary,"You must spend the money and get a transfer case for a portable generator.It is a saftey item that prevents backfeed to the power line when the electricity is restored.Also,a little known fact is these transfer cases actually increase the capacity of the generator by allowing various circuits to be turned on sequentially.I have a ten year old 5,000 watt generator and with this set-up,I can run a furnace,2 referigerators,a well pump,and a kitchen panel for a microwave,coffeemaker,kitchen lights,and I also hook-up my T.V. to an extension from the kitchen to living room!The transfer case makes all the difference,so,even though the parts and professional hook-up(highly recommended fot about 150-200 dollars)may cost as much as a generator,it IS WELL WORTH IT!"
3,wmck,"When you install a remote inlet box on the outside of your building, if you run solid wire to it, you should use 8ga or 10ga wire short pc's about 4"" long of starnded wire and use wire nuts. This will speed up things also. The inlet will not hold solid wire in place to the male adapter. Over all I had trouble with one switch and it would not lock in to run the F line I just took it apart and it had burr in it., A-B-C-D-E all the rest worked fine. As stated it was very eazy to hook up. Running the 50' of wire and mounting the outside box I was less then 2 hours. If you do not some electric skills, you should call, to have it hooked, by a elect man."
5,Works as intended and easy to install,"I am no electrician but I am handy. This was very easy to install. Review the online video and read the instructions. I installed the power cord inlet box inside my basement near a window 30 feet from the electrical box. I choose to run 10 gage wire inside conduit to the inlet box. The end of the power cord did not fit my generator. I purchased the correct end and made a change, now everything works as it should."
1,not in stock after 2 weeks,"no update after date promised to be shipped, plus 1 week. not impressed. should at least let me know so i could order elseware. hope the product is better than the service."
2,EMERGENCY POWER ONLY,FOR MOST HOME'S THIS WILL WORK GREAT. (KIND OF PRICEY)IF YOU DON'T PLAN ON RUNNING ANY HEAVY STUFF. I USE IT IN MY HOUSE AND WHEN I USED THE COFFEE MAKER (APPOX 1500 WATTS) YOU COULD HERE THE GENERATOR (7500 WATT) STRUGGLE WHEN THE POT CYCLED ON AND OFF. IT WILL NOT RUN A ELECTRIC HEATING SYSTEM OR HOUSE AIR COND. IT WILL RUN YOUR FURNACE IF YOU ARE ON GAS. AGAIN YOU MUST BE VERY SELECTIVE TURNING ON ELECTRICAL STUFF IN THE HOUSE. IT IS MEANT AS A STOP GAP MEASURE LIGHTS AND BASIC SPACE HEATER FOR 1 ROOM. I WOULD NOT RUN TV'S OR OTHER ELECTRONIC DEVICES DUE TO VARYING POWER LEVELS YOU COULD MESS THEM UP RUNNING A TV OR COMPUTER ON 105 TO 120 VOLTS MAY NOT BE GOOD. ALSO YOU MUST TURN ON HI WATTAGE STUFF FIRST THEN LOW WATTAGE NEXT DU TO INITIAL POWER SURGES.IF THIS POST BOTHERS YOU SORRY BUT DON'T BE A CHEAP SKATE AND FIND OUT THAT YOU NEEDED A BIGGER GENERATOR AND SWITCHING UNIT. PLEASE HAVE AN ELECTRICIAN COME IN AND EVALUATE WHAT YOU NEED!!!
2,Overpriced,"Bought this one in a hurry and was dissapointed when I got home. The author spends too much ink on staff (i.e web standards)she could have covered in one or two paragraphs. As a matter of fact the entire book could have been written in less than half the number of pages the author consumed with this book. After my dissapointment, I went online and in two hours I knew more on CSS that what the book provided. Online tutorials (which are free by the way)are lightyears better than what you will learn from this book."
2,Brief and out dated,This little biology book was good a few years ago; now the information is out dated for current tests. It is also too brief for use as a study guide alone. Time to put this one in the archives.
3,Good for the Basics,"This book is pretty good for basic biology introduction. The material is clear and concise though some of the information is a bit outdated. It is a good book if you're looking to brush up on basic biology concepts before returning to school (college) or for parents wanting to get a refresher to help high schoolers on their homework, but don't expect this to help you sail through College Biology without reading or doing the work."
4,Not a bad deal,"I bought this book to prepare for the Praxis exam. I found that after reading through it twice and doing all of the review questions I acquired a fairly deep grasp of the basics. I supplemented it with readings from Kimballs Biology pages on the web. Although I have yet to learn whether I passed or failed, I feel that I did the best I could by buying this book and studying it though roughly. Like chicken soup for a fever, it doesn't hurt."
4,Helpful but not magic...,"Not that helpful for a stock engine, but if used as part of a package (free flow exhaust, injectors, set up the pump a bit) it's worthwhile. Follow the directions for cleaning, it won't take air pressure cleaning like a paper filter."
5,A great introduction to Mark Rothko.,This is a great introduction to the works of Mark Rothko. The reproductions of his work are very interesting. There is some background information on Rothko and some essays from other artists.
5,As The World Turns Finale Episodes !,This is excellent for fans of the long running As The World Turns ! Wraps up lots of stories in the usual Oakdale style.Really enjoyed this as my favorites Eileen Fulton as Lisa Grimaldi and Colleen Zenk as Barbara Ryan are featured.With the drama surrounding Luke Snyder and the retirement of Bob Hughes the show really went out a winner.Buy this one !
3,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed with the workmanship and quality of this book. Given its steep price, I expected a high-quality art book. What I received was a ""printed in China with cheap materials"" book whose pages are not even acid-free paper. How can the steep price be justified?"
5,Air cleaner base,This worked Perfect. When you run an HEI distributor there is not enough room to run a large diameter air cleaner unless you have this base with the offset. Fixed the problem.BW
5,Love it,"I must say I do notice a difference in my look. I am satisfied, and will continue to use this product. I was using another brand, and will switch to this exclusively. thanks neuvaderm!!"
4,Seem to be working,"I got this product since the other brand I was using, Kumaara, was discontinued. I have been using this for about a month, and it seems to be working fine. However, I cannot really tell how much this product is contributing to the result because I am combining with other products, DHS eye cream in the morning and DHS olive virgin oil at night. With these, I am definetely getting a good result."
3,Ponce de Leon's Fountain of Youth!,The desire that a cream will somehow turn back the ravages of time is laughable. Neuvaderm is a good moisturizer but there is absolutely no difference in the depth and number of wrinkles on my face after using it for a while.
5,Replaced $100 Face cream with Neuvaderm,I have been able to effectively get rid of the EXPENSIVE facial cream that I was hooked on for the past year now that i have found Neuvaderm! I got a free bottle from a friend in a Christmas gift basket at work and I absolutely love it. The cream goes on so smooth and dries really easy. My skin has a super silky feel after I use it. LOVE IT! I am very surprised that Amazon sells it for so cheap as I thought it would be twice the cost. I am almost out of my latest bottle and will definitely be ordering this from Amazon as they have great prices and fast shipping. I recommend this facial cream to anyone looking to buy an effective cream for a reasonable price
2,defective spout,Can't really evaluate the product itself because ease of use is impaired by the fact that the cream will not emit from the push spout. It is annoying and wasteful to dump more than is necessary for one facial application into one's hand. Can you have the manufacturer replace this vial ? It's a shame to have the faulty delivery device impact the product when so many other purveyors get it right.
1,A waste,"It didn't do absolutely anything. Don't waste your money. It didn't help with fine lines and wrinkles, and it didn't make my skin look better."
3,Etta Saves The Day,"Not the best performances by either Ammons or Stitt and the sound quality is not great. Etta Jones is the actual stand out on this set. Her interpretation here of ""Exactly Like You"" is one of her best performances ever and judging from the audience applause it was a crowd pleaser. Her signature ""Don't Go To Srangers"" sounds as good as her original take."
5,Spectacular,the record is a radical change from their previous effort. This one more in the vein of Elephant riders and other post sabbath rock outpourings. I could not be more pleased. A truly great record but possibly not one that their old fans are expecting.
2,New Panthers!!! Eh.....,"This album is not very good at all. Damn. The recording quality sounds really bad, and when the parts get heavy, it sounds like nothing. Damn. The vocalist's voice has severely gone down-hill since their previous album. Damn. The entire album is so predictable and un-interesting, it may take awhile for me to want to give it another chance. Damn."
3,measure carefully,This bumper was not long enough for a standard crib. Be sure to measure carefully before ordering
4,A love of dog 2,An excellent soundtrack. I liked very much. The main title is a very-splendored song.
5,benji soundtrack,"I have been looking for this item for YEARS. When i finally found it on Amazon, the seller shipped it quickly, and was an absolute pleasure to do business with. Thank you again!"
3,A Solid Effort!,"Geoff Bellman's take on the Beauty and the Beast story is intended to help you breathe new life into stagnant, unworkable bureaucracies. While nicely written, this book fails to provide much in the way of hands-on technique that can be applied to real-life business. Nevertheless, we (...) recommend this book to anyone looking for an uncommonly inspirational viewpoint of modern-day organizations."
5,Words That Sing,"If you want a break from other types of books, this book is a lovely change of pace.It consists of very short prose pieces, perfect to pick up for a few minutes or to read before bed. If words could sing, this would be quite a fascinating composition--light, happy notes; deep, melancholy tones; charming melodies.For me, I immediately wanted to share certain passages with others. I will keep this book on my shelf to refer back to from time to time, when I want to remember how beautifully words can convey images.I also found myself amazed that a translator (Denys Johnson-Davies) could do such a fine job. Often translated works have an awkwardness, but these pieces each flow and stand on their own as individual works.We read this book for our book club and it was wonderful because we could each choose several pieces and read them aloud and enjoy them together."
2,Too many problems.,"The manufacturer of this product is very sub-standard. I had to return the first one I ordered because after one time of pulling back the hammer, it wouldn't release. It's designed not to be dry-fired over and over, but not even once? I received a replacement very promptly (which is why Grendel's Cave is a great seller), and I started having issues with that one too almost immediately with the bullet chamber opening not staying in place (which took a judicious amount of double-sided tape to fix so that it would remain closed!). It's a nice piece for display purposes only, but do NOT try to use any of the functionality."
3,As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me,"I found out about this movie from my dentist but after some investigation found out that the person that claimed to have made this journey was a fraud. The remake of this movie is much better ""The Way Back"". It is very interesting to read a true account of this mans journey and the trials that he faced."
2,Missed Opportunity,"Well, just finished watching this, I am a big fan of WWII movies, i.e. ""Downfall"" & ""Stalingrad"" are some of the best. This on the other hand had me laughing out loud at a few of the formulaic story-lines they threw in, the completely ridiculous love scene with the pin-up Inuit girl was right out of ""Dances With Wolves"" (look close and you will see a Hello Kitty poster in the tepee) but perhaps most laughable was the showdown with the NKVD captain at the Iranian border crossing at the end, I almost fell outta my seat. The musical score was right out of a Godzilla movie, and the ending was shot like a Hallmark Hall of Fame made for TV Xmas film. Too bad, great premise for a movie, and I guess the book was great."
1,As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me,"Opened it up, put it in a CD player for my Plasma TV and NOTHING. ""This disc cannot be copied or played"" so basically I have to send it back to Amazon. Apparently this comes from a very low quality, if not ""home"" style lab. Either their burner gave out, or this ONE just didn't take. Either way, it's a lot of time wasted unnecessarily. Buyer Beware!"
3,Not as Good as the Book!,"This is an entertaining movie, don't get me wrong. But as the old cliche goes, the book is definitely better than the movie. Read the book first, THEN check this movie out. Regardsless, the story (which is mainly true) is incredible. It deals with a former German POW who escapes from Siberia back to Germany. The original book was written after Josef Bauer, an author, heard that a former POW, Clemens Forell, had seen a Yeti in the Himalayas. There must certainly have been some creative license when Bauer recounted the tale, but it is still an amazing story.Unfortunately, the movie glosses over or removes many central characters to the book which probably would have bogged down or considerably lengthened the movie. Regardless, the move is still entertaining. My only complaint is the cheesy love scene between Forell and the native Central Asian girl. It is Harlequin romance on film. Blah...Otherwise I recommend it."
3,movie does not compare to the book,"i read the book in its entirety before watching the movie, and the latter pales in comparison. the book was absolutely amazing, whereas the movie glosses over even seemingly important plots in the book, and depicts scenes differently than in the book.book is a must read...i can't give a great review to the movie b/c it doesn't do the story justice."
5,Excellent insight into the time,This is one of the best books I have read about the OSS operations in a theatre that is rarely considered.
4,WW2 -SOUTH AMERICAN ACTION.,WEB Griffin fills a gap in my military history of actions outside the main combat arenas. He obviously researches thoroughly and the result is gripping all the way through.
5,Superlative war novel,"Informative style, attention to detail, well rounded characters!Love the setting in Argentina, and historic information brought to the readers attention!"
4,Good story line and a greet read,I've read most of his other series and have enjoyed them. I don't buy any books anymore that I cant read on my Fire
4,Honor Bound,The book is a nice continuation of this series. A little long on the poetic license but an easy read.
4,A good live-album by this straight-forward rockers!,"Punk, this is Punk: straight forward, energetic, crazy descent lyrics. All are here. Surely not the best NY Dolls album, but it's an interesting document of the band. This is their early live album, and it features Johnny Thunder's best guitar playing. ""Seven Day Weekend"" is quite joyful, and ""Bad detective"" and ""Vietnamese baby"" is surprisingly reflective commentary of the society. Great work. Buy it if you love punk: it's some of the excellent moments of punk, not those spirit-less cheap punk power-chord stummers."
3,Good introduction to Narnia,"I enjoyed reading The Magician's Nephew, it cleared up a lot of things about the creation of Narnia and interesting information about some of the characters. Looking forward to read the rest of the books in the Chronicles of Narnia."
1,absurd,"Everything was going fine until I got to chapter three (""The Wood Between the Worlds"") in which the author states that the planet Jupiter has a single moon: ""he saw Jupiter quite close -- close enough to see its moon.""I was unable to read any further.I mean, what an idiot. Any schoolboy that there are at least 63 Jovian satellites. Check Wikipedia if you don't believe me."
1,The Truth,"A fallacious account of Macedonian history, most likely fueled by greek propaganda. Most literature on the history of Macedonia is manipulated by foreign parties with their own interests at hand. If you are interested in the history of Macedonia I encourage you to read materials from all sides, and speak to people. The truth is never easy to find. History can never be changed."
4,Nice,"I got this for my friend as a birthday present. I've had the chance to look at it and use it though, and it's pretty good.Pros-Huge magazine (20 BBs) for such a small gun.-Cool looking and fits your hand very well.-Accurate.-""Pocket pistol"" size, which is perfect since it's marketed as the ""best-selling backup model.""-Sturdy--heavy plastic and metal.Cons-Magazine is hard to load.-Cannot see how many rounds are in the magazine.-Sights are terrible. They're just little stubs and are difficult to aim with.-Only 190 FPS.All in all, this is a very good little pistol to carry around as a backup, but it's not something I'd want to carry around as my main weapon."
4,Fun for all ages!,"Having received this video as a gift, we watched it as a family, accompanied by a lot of laughter and ""I didn't know that"". The kids managed to show this to most of their friends, the youngest even taking it to school where his 1st grade teacher used it as a part of her unit on Careers.The video is an overall winner. Anyone, any age, will enjoy the playful and informative story and all will come away with a greater understanding and respect for both the lobster and the lobsterman. BUY IT!"
4,"Not a must-have, but a nice addition","I agree with a few of my predecessors, the storyline isn't really conclusive all the time, e.g.: How did Bruce Wayne recover from his injury? It shows his way back into being the Batman, but how does one recover from paraplegia? I didn't find the development of the personalities too convincing either, and I really disliked the part, where Azrael had all those visions, which haunted him and drove him on at the same time.Still: All three books together make up for a good read, and I never regretted ordering all three of the books (while part three was sent from the US, which took forever) all at once. It's not the best trilogy for people, who want to get to know Batman, and the books are clearly not as ingenious as ""The Dark Night Returns"" or ""Hush"", but one could definitely do worse."
3,"batman:knightfall,part three;Knightsend","story line was average.expected more from the fight between batman and the new batman.also thought robin would have put up more of a fight.good buildup of why new batman went too far and thought he was the real batman.ultimately,i thought story did not end conclusively because it did not give new batman any credit for what he had done for gotham and sent him away without any reference to where he would go?"
4,Knightfall 3,"The book came quickly and it was in decent condition. However, I was a bit disappointed because it was not the edition indicated in the picture. I was trying to complete a collection, and now the third book is sort of an eyesore on my shelf because the editions don't match up. I'm giving this person 4 stars still, because I'm sure he/she did not make this mistake intentionally...still, I wish they would have verified that the front cover actually matched the image in the ad."
3,the last of three,"i just finished the knight fall story line.the story was great.the tale of batmans struggles to return to his former self after suffering at the hands of bane.the art work in all three was outstanding the first book was by far the best!the second and third books storys were missing something.i don't know what,it seemed the story just drug on while you waited for the ending.i was shocked also by the end of this book,you will be to.although the knight fall story ends here it goes on into prodigal, which i just started on and seems to pick up where the others left off.the books were worth the money but buying it used might be the way to go."
2,I do not think this filter works well.,I have this filter. When the water is used in a humidifier it leaves red slimy deposits. When the water is left in a Poland Spring bottle for a week it smells like dirt. So how can it be filtering the water well?
1,Think carefully before buying this CD!,"Rick Wakeman is a Genius, and I just saw him with YES. I ordered this CD, and the other enhanced companion CD ( it comes with a grainy Video playable on your computer) WOW, these are terrible!Before you order these, listen to free ""YES"" MIDI instrumental MP3's on the net. These 4 Wakeman CD's do not feature YES, or any actual Keyboard elements from original recordings, and they are expensive too. No, don't do it!"
5,Where is the sequel?,"I found this book by accident. It was a great read, with only two minor flaws, which I attributed to the printers and not the writers. The twists & turns in the plot were very good, & the characters weren't perfect, just human. Much better story than Ludlum or Grisham have written. The contrasts & comparisons between the KGB & CIA were very good, showing that all government agencies are the same. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!"
5,This book is a MUST read for all Butler's fans!!! ;-),"Brett Butler's ""Knee Deep in Paradise"" is a book for everyone to read. She tells, not only abuot her live as a star, but of her hard life while growing up. This book opens your eyes to things that battered women all over the world hide... the fact that they feel helpless and destoryed by what is happening to them. Butler's life could not have gotten any worse when her husband pulls a gun on her and she feels the bullet pass by her ear. Then, just to assure herself that she wasn't hit, she searches the wall of the hotel for a bullet hole. This book is a must read for anyone who is a fan of ""Grace Under Fire"" or Brett Butler's comedy"
5,When is her next book coming out,"I have followed Brett Butler since i discovered the sitcom Grace Under Fire. Being in a relationship with a southern belle and being Australian myself.. i can relate totally to most of the things Brett has written about with regards to the southern ways and southern manners. The woman in my view rocks !! .... Instead of crying into her mint tea, she writes a no holds barred, except for diplomatic reasons, story of where she came from , who she was, is and has become. Nothing is glossed over.It is real. She in my view has remained grounded even after all she has encountered in her life. Brett, keep writing, you can only get better. This reader wishes you had another book written as an aftermath for this one. Where are you now ? WHat is your life like now... have you remained ""clean"" from the demon drugs & drink and where are you going .....PS : are you single and dating ..."
1,Suprisingly Dull,"I was absolutely blown away at how DULL this book was. Brett Butler is my favorite comedian of all time. I love her stand-up act and her television show. I guess I was fooled into thinking her witty humor would translate into her book. The story itself begins with how her grandparents met, and very slowly progresses with the occasional misplaced flash back or flash forward. This book was dull even by biography standards. I wondered why this book was so quickly discounted at my local bookstore when it was just published."
4,Tom Jones - Remastered Originals,"You may ask why only 4 stars?? Out of the 50 tracks on this great 2 CD set, I would have chosen other tracks than some that are on this set. However, I am highly pleased with the quantity of tracks, many of the originals I love. The price was great for this number of song selections, and included a great package insert as an added bonus. And the remastering, in my opinion, was so good in some of the tracks, I heard sounds on some familiar tunes I had never heard before. ""Remastering"" the Master, Tom Jones, is hard to do. Bar none, he is the master of his craft. Highly recommended !!"
4,A Great Addition,"I recently added this to my om Jones collection and found it great it included all the songs from my old 33 LP's I liked the fact they put the songs in order by the year as to when they were originally released and also for Steve Solder Tom Jones can still have a hit for his information his Reload CD was one of the biggest hits in Europe in 1999 and 2000 with over 5 million in sells 3 million being in Great Britain it also produced 5 hit singles the biggest being Sexbomb a number 1 hit all over Europe,Asia,Australia,and Japan"
2,Re-Mastered? from poor quality recordings?,"I am very disappointed in the quality of these 2 CDs (set), the sound is poor like an old 45rpm record. Had to turn volume up full blast to even get a facsimile of the Tom I remember. If you're looking for a trip down memory lane, don't buy this albumn as you'll be disappointed. It does a dis-service to this fine singer's depth and range. The shipping/handling fee caused this item to be 2X the listed price as it apparently came over from Holland. Dutch treat? NOT"
5,Contact the author,"Hi guys and gals, I am the author of 'Lured by Lust' and welcome any comments or feedback on it. Look forward to hearing from you - email me on taniapicarda@hotmail.comlove tania p xxx"
1,Trashy lady in a disjointed trashy book ...,"This book it appears to be a compilation of bad dreams coming true. Clara the young and very raunchy employee at an art gallery not only has trouble keeping her fingers off her own body but probably has never learned to say the word no to anybody. She has an email relationship with a Mr X who seems to be watching her every move and giving her advice on how to loosen up a little and enjoy life. Boy was that bad advice, if anything, Clara should maybe like tighten up a little and shedprobably enjoy sex a lot more. That was maybe why I didn't like the book since I got the distinct impression that Clara, although she follows the compulsory moves and acts, really never let her hair down ... Oh well if you are into it then this book is probably enjoyable for you..."
1,Costly and product varies in taste,"This looked like a great way to buy a variety pack of nuts, in snack sizes that would keep me from eating too many. The problem is that peanuts are sort of the ""junk"" nut if you're trying to eat healthy. (stick to almonds and walnuts)Plus buying individual packs is more expensive. But the worse offense- several packages were rancid! It seemed to be the plain salted peanuts mostly. The honey nuts had a slightly off taste, but not as bad as the salted peanuts. The cashews were OK, but not as good as cashews I've had from regular cans of Planters. I think what might happen is that shipping in the summer in the Southern states causes a lot of degradation in the flavor in the packages.Don't waste your money on this, because you just don't know what you're going to get."
3,Convenient to have when on the go,"This package of variety nuts is very convenient to have when on the go and for my son's lunch box, he likes these but the price on Amazon is too high for mostly peanuts. It is a much better price at Sam's Club for the exact same thing. I love buying on amazon (sort of an Amazon addict)because of the convenience and great prices but you do have to keep in mind Sam's Club is very competitive price wise it's just a pain in the neck going there (when spoiled by Amazon) plus always end up spending more and having to bring it all home. Love the free home delivery Amazon offers so if you want to pay more for the convenience then you should buy these on Amazon."
3,BEWARE - Sizes have decreased - no longer 2 oz packs,"I have ordered and reordered this item several times. The last shipment I received (two boxes) the package sizes had decreased from 2 oz to 1.75 for the peanuts and 1.5 for the cashews.I realize this is from Planters and it's a sign of the times but the product description needs to be updated.We like these at work but just like Granola bars, the price stays the same (or goes up) and the product size goes down.The product itself is fine but I am sick of getting ripped off by changes in product portions.Planters-Nuts On the Go Snack Packs, 24/2 oz Variety Packs"
4,Mixed Nut,"Nuts were purchased to make snack, fruit, cheese & wine gift baskets. It provided variety that was used as a filler. Great for the holidays."
2,Planter Nuts,The nuts tasted old. It is supposed to be a variety pack but 80 percent of the items were salted peanuts. Not buying this product again.
2,RIP OFF...,"This ""deal"" is a rip off when you can get 2/$1 at the store. And you get to pick which types of Planters you want."
4,Delicious,I must admit that this is a bad temptation but I have always really like the flavor of planters peanuts.These come at a fair price and it is an easy way to stock up where you will not go broke.
4,My Platers Purchase,"I love Platters and this was a great purchase. I found out that my son loves the Honey Roasted, Me not at all."
4,planters nut pack,These arrived fresh. Come in individual packs just right for a snack without too many calories. Arrived in about a week after ordering.
2,Guitar Tech Review,"Typically used on electric guitars that have vibratos, (whammy bars), graphite's self-lubrication aids in less string binding at the nut, thus, keeping the guitar better in tune. While there are many other string nut materials on the market, graphite is one of my least favorite to work with because it tends to not be very durable. While its self-lubrication and sustaining properties are very good, the material itself often chips and fractures very easily. It's very common to see a broken graphite nut at the low E on shredder guitars.NOTE; GRAPHITE IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE GRAPHTECH COMPANY. Graphtech is a wonderful string nut manufacturer. They make high pressure laminate nuts impregnated with Teflon.Hope this was helpful,Guitartec"
3,Great Stories horrid endings,"I absolutely loved both stories but I have to say that I hated the way the stories end. Each story ends with the characters' first love scene and then it jumps to an epilogue that takes place one year later. The stories need just a brief, maybe one page transition from that love scene before it jumps to the epilogue and it would flow a lot better. It shows the sign of a great writer to get the reader so emotionaly involved that you don't want the book to end but we still need to end the book without feeling cheated from a great ending."
3,"Good, but not as entertaining as I had hoped.","I'm glad Ms. Miller's returned to writing historical romances, but although this one was good enough for me to complete, I felt as if I had been left dangling. There didn't seem to be as much fire between the heros and heroines, unlike her other books. I hope her next historical will be better."
5,Ywo Brothers: The Lawman/ The Gunslinger,"Great book. I have read all of Linda Lael Miller's books. I lost this one and needed to replace it. Also, reread it and love it just as much as the first time."
4,An unfiltered view of work in a brothel,"I enjoyed this book because it told it like it was and didn't sugarcoat anything. Sometimes I felt sad for the girls' stories, but overall I found it to be a very interesting read of life in a brothel. A great read if you're going on a flight because it makes the time go by very quickly."
3,Diverting,"This band has produced a pleasing recording of their own arrangements of Raymond Scott pieces. Most of the material is his well-known novelty music, while a few are based on his relatively obscure electronic music. This is a nice recording but not a vital one, unless one is a major Scott fan.The band has a nice French cafe sound, effected by the accordion and zither, and the arrangements are jazzy and touch on a variety of styles, from cakewalk to early rock and roll to a John Barry/James Bond quality, and are all well done without being particularly exciting or adventurous. The mixing is a little dense, and the band is let down by a rather lugubrious drummer. My personal feeling is that Scott's work is crying out for a treatment a la what John Zorn did on the incredible 'The Big Gundown' for Ennio Morricone's movie themes. And while perfectly respectable, this is sadly not that type of work."
4,Real surprise.,Found this in the cut out bin and it ends up being among one of my favorites.Song For An Angry Young Man is worth the price.
4,Good book -,"It was a christian read, but one who is not christian such as myself got a good bit out of it- I've recommended it to my female friends, and they love it too. Good book!"
1,Better late than never?????????,"I have to say that I am a little bit dissapointed in Amazon's late release of Nip Tuck Season 3 for the US. If you look at the Amazon.UK website, you will find that this has been released for some time now. I know that this is nowhere near as bad as say....price gouging on the new X-Boxes that were in limited supply at Christmas, but I feel like we are getting the shaft again. I think that I am done with Amazon."
3,Disappointing season,"Nip/tuck really surprised me when I first started watching it. I expected it to be completely shallow, mindless, packed with shock-value and seedy thrills. Well, it has always been packed with shock-value and seedy thrills, but it also had some deeper undercurrents and poignant moments, and most important, I actually found myself interested in the characters and caught up in seeing how their lives and relationships unfolded. That was during seasons one and two. Season three, however, was exactly like I thought the show would be before I ever started watching. Completely shallow, it seemed like all the show's writers focused on was shock-value and seedy thrills, but to this end they began somewhat repeating themselves, and really reaching. It seemed to get pretty lifeless, and I found myself no longer caring about the characters or what happened to them. Hopefully season four will be a return to the form of the excellent first two seasons."
4,If you are a Fan.. You must buy..,"Nip/Tuck is a great story on TV. It has everything for an adult. It has beautiful people, great story lines and keeps you in tune. I've purchased seasons 1 & 2 and now I own 3. I can't wait until they put 4 out so I can buy it.A must collection for those who like trashy stories and like to have a little gossip in their lives."
4,Not as good as the first 2 seasons,"I found this season to be good, although not as gripping as the first 2 seasons. I still really enjoyed it, and it's worth buying the boxset so you can watch the episodes back to back without any ads!"
4,Truly Riveting...,"Nip/Tuck Season 3 offers much suspense. This season's running story involves ""The Carver"". During season 2 we learned a little about this character who loves to carve the faces of beautiful people with the saying that ""beauty is a curse on the world"". So naturaly Sean and Christian ""fix"" the Carver's creations by fixing the victim's faces. THis season is truly a mystery as every person who watches tries to figure out who the Carver is. The season's end twist is definitly one to watch."
4,The Carver,"Ryan Murphy is one of the most original writer/director/creator and Nip Tuck is the result of it,the most haunting series ever showed on television.I liked the third season,not as much as I liked the first and the second,but it deserves to be cosidered good for many reasons(the cast,the acting,the soundtrack,the guest stars),but I did not like the Carver thing ,I think it could be less Carver for me thank you,but tha parallel situations concerning Christian's life and Sean's life were very good"
1,You lost me on Season 3,"I loved Seasons 1 and 2 of Nip Tuck. I thought it was a great show and brilliant writing. However, season 3 just went way too far to the point I stopped watching it. I'll give Season 4 a try but hopefully the writers will go back to what worked for them the first two seasons."
4,"It beats CSI Miami, New York, Pittsburgh and all the others","I just finished watching Season 3 of Nip/Tuck. While it was definitely the least well-done of the 3 seasons, it is still way more compelling than any of the formulaic cop or law dramas on network TV. Some of the episodes had developments that didn't really add anything to the overall progress of the main characters' stories. The point is Nip/Tuck fans are going to watch this season, and casual viewers should pick it up too."
4,Nip/Tuck - The complete Third Season,Good quality - no problems. Great condition of product upon receipt.
4,good show,"Pretty good show. Now as good as the first couple of seasons, but interesting character development makes it worth a watch. Like a lot of cable shows, some of the story lines have gotten a little ""crazy"" by this time, but not so much that it's comedy or a big joke. If you liked the first couple of seasons, you'll enjoy this one, although it is different."
4,Works Great!,"I'm a first time buyer of dvd's! At first I was a bit leary of buying something that's been used. But I was quite impressed with the quality of the discs. There were not problems at all. The cover was visibly ""used"", but that's ok. I bought the 4th season supposedy ""new"" from a different vendor & was so very dissapointed at the poor quality of the discs."
4,Third Times a Charm,For Nip and Tuck fans this is a solid season. Yes it has high and low points and some poor writing but the final cut is still one of the better cutting edge shows on the market. It's no soap but I will get you thinging and sometimes steamed up.
4,Still one of the best...,"One of the best shows on television still, but dipped a little in creativity towards the end of season 3. The Carver storyline was very interesting until the end of the season when they just had filler episodes that had nothing to do with the Carver at all, and then the season finale, although smart, was not satisfying. Season 2 is still the high point of this series.Also, whoever said season 4 is the last, that is not true. FX just hasn't renewed it yet beyond that. Ryan Murphy said he is willing to go up to season 7, and it just might, especially since it is the higest-rated show on FX. It even has better ratings than The Shield, and they're starting their 7th season next year."
3,Buyer beware,"I have really enjoyed the series up until now, the third season. I was disappointed that there isn't an English closed caption with this series unlike the rest. The makers of the season or the manufacturers decided to save money by not offering English captioning. This season has also been less interesting than the two previous seasons."
2,On the tracks....,"This is just a horrible season for a show that was so innovative in seasons one and two. Sure, there are some good episodes here; even a few turns mid-season that could keep you guessing. Basically, though, if you can't see the ending coming, you are lying on the tracks with six 40-ounce Old English in ya. What a shame. I won't ""spoil"" it by revealing just how obvious the whole thing is, but....IT IS! If you think you know -- you know. The show was so damn good in the first two seasons that I hate not to support it, but please save yourself the money and go buy Weeds, Season 1, to find the newest revolution in cable."
1,I didn't receive my package.,"Amazon is saying that my package has been delivered, but, i still haven't got anything. I did the track packaging and it said it got delivered to the wrong place so there was a delay. Now it is saying it got delivered already, but, I don't have anything."
3,nip/tuck season 3,Everything about this set was fine with the exception on the last episode (the grand finale). There were MANY spots where the disc just stopped as if stuck in place. Some of them resumed play (skipping a few seconds of video) in a minute or less while others lasted so long that I had to find a way to get past them. Usually I went back to scene selection and chose something after the stop. I purchased this set used and I have no complaints about any of the other discs.
5,Love it,"I love Nip/Tuck. This season gets a little depressing, but it's still great and all apart of the drama! I hate the carver...that character creeps me out and you'll never guess who it is...it's got a nice twist. That's all I'll say though. Enjoy!"
3,I hope seaon 4 is better,"I was a huge fan of seasons 1 and 2. I thought they were fantastic. Season 3 on the other hand.... it's good, but not nearly as great as the other seasons. The writing didn't seem as sharp and in many scenes, the mix of writing and oddball music made parts of many episodes seem like a soap opera - which is not something that Nip/Tuck should be. I felt like there was a lot of stuff thrown in simply for the sake of drama and not necessarily character developement. So, overall, a decent season, but didn't pack as much of a punch as the previosu two."
2,Was going well until..,"I got to the third disc and there was a scratch on it so the first episode of the disc wont play, hard to watch a series when you miss an episode very dissapointing!"
5,Thank you,"Sorry sooo late, just got the email. Really appreciate this, it was a gift for my son in Iraq."
5,Awsome!!!!!!,"Nip/tuck season 1, 2, 3, and 4 are the best, This two guys are very pretty and the things that they doing AH!!!!!!! so crazy i recomended!!!!! buy it plz"
3,Priced correctly,Bought for my 2yr old son and he likes to take the balls in and out of net. Like other reviews my right suction cup didnt want to stick but on closer inspection notice the edges of cup were bent in so if made sure flat when attaching and sticks fine. The suction cups wont stick to porous/ceramic tile so have to hang top of tub which my son likes just as much. This toy also sticks to fridge and he like to play with it there as well. Overall is decent toy for the price paid.
2,Doesn't stick to wall - defeats purpose,Wouldn't recommend this purchase; it doesn't stick to the wall but at least there's still the balls to play with in the water.
5,Almost perfect,"My 1 yr old recieved this for his bday. HE LOVES IT! It's even fun for me :) The only problem is one of the suction cups-it came bent so it has some trouble sticking to the tub, but not a big deal, I can always replace the suction cup. Overall, great toy!"
3,Suction cups don't stick,"I'll have to agree with the reviews that warn about the suction cups. Straight out of the box, one of the suction cups sticks just fine, but the other will release after about 10 minutes, with nothing in the net.I've tried wiping the suction cup, keeping it and the wall wet (or dry), and nothing seems to work. This is a quality control issue with Alex Toys.Yes, the net is closed (the balls will not fall out of the bottom of the net), but as other reviewers note, you're welcome to cut a hole if you want the net to be like a normal basketball net. Otherwise, leave it as is and give yourself somewhere to hold the balls."
4,3 year old still likes this,"We've had several different uses out of this hoops and ball set. The three balls are a perfect size for our son, who has had these since he turned 2. He has other toys such as floating rings that he uses the balls with and while younger he just used the net to store the balls. Later, he figured out that the balls could squirt, and even later he would bite the ball with the hole facing outwards to squirt it and laugh and laugh. He's only now starting to use to to actually shoot hoops.I'm going to cut the bottom off the net soon so that he can put the hoop higher on the bathroom wall and shoot hoops. The suction cups have worked very well for us and still do, and no mold or anything thus far. The suction cups didn't work well in our other bathroom because the tiles have texture."
5,Alex toys rub a Dub Hoops in the Tub,"Lots of fun. Our Toddler loves this...we even use it in the kitchen, attached to the fridge or cabinet door."
2,Doesn't stick to wall,"I bought this for my two-year-old son because I thought he would enjoy putting the balls in the hoop. Unfortunately, it is totally impossible to stick the hoop to the wall. I have regular tile on the shower wall and both my husband and I failed to get the suction cups attached to the hoop to stick. Very disappointing!"
2,Had to stop using...,"My 18-24 month old got fairly annoyed with this bath toy. The hoop is just a net, so the balls don't come out of the bottom. You have to reach back into the hoop to get the balls out. When my son or I did this, the hoop came off the bathtub wall. I specifically had a problem with the left suction cup not staying attached. The right suction cup worked fine, so the hoop was always falling sideways. Also, the balls have small holes in them and take in water. I had a serious issue with mold collecting in the balls...and at bathtime, if you squeezed the balls, a ton of mold flakes come out. Unless I cleaned them out before bath time, I really didn't want them in the tub. I'd suggest going with another brand."
1,Buyers beware,I am not sure if we got a defective item but it does not stick to the shower tile. The suction cups do not work. The hoop is extremely small.
4,Tub-Ball Scores,"My nearly two year old son loves this in the tub. He's actually pretty hilarious, the balls end up everywhere and hoop sometimes makes a splash. Entertaining way to coax him into the tub on the days he refuses. The only thing I didnt really care for was that the hoop ""catches"" the balls instead of releasing them, so for the few times he actually uses it correctly, he gets frustrated to try and retrieve the ball(s)."
3,"Ok toy, but watch out for mold!","My son recieved this toy when he was about 18 months old, and we started using the big bath tub. He likes it well enough, even though the fact that the net doesn't have a hole in it was frustrating for him at first. We have to stick it to the inside of the bathtub ... the suction cups don't work unless you have completely flat tiles (ours are uneven). But my biggest problem is with the balls ... they quickly grow mold inside, and I can't get it out! So needless to say, we will be looking for something else."
3,No Hoop Hole,"This product is great for storing the balls. But when my boys are playing with it, it's often frustrating because the ball stays in the hoop. Because of this you can' place it up high, so you have to put it at their level and often they take it off or it falls off because they are trying to retrieve the balls."
5,Great gift,I got this for my nephew and son and they absolutely love this. I highly recommend this for small toddlers.
2,Thought it was okay until mounting it to my tripod,"At first I noticed that the build quality is a bit cheap, but I didn't mind because the plastic materials keep the weight down. The problem is that it doesn't connect well to the camera. There is too much play between the two parts (camera and battery pack). I also have an arca swiss style L bracket mounted to the camera and battery pack. When I mount the rig in my tripod's quick release plate and secure everything down you really see how flimsy this thing is. Handheld it's fine, but on a tripod there's just too much movement. I've decided I'll just keep an extra battery or two in my pocket and shoot verticals with the camera's shutter release."
3,Nice,First a word of caution: you will have to buy a second battery in order to use this one to its maximum potential. On the plus side it provides you with a much more stable grip on the camera and it also provides a second vertical shutter button. Fort that alone it is worth the extra expense.
1,Failed after a few months of use,"I am an adventure photographer, and I liked the feel of the battery pack, but after just a few months of use in Europe, Vietnam and Cambodia, it failed. It now will only power the camera from the battery in the slot closest to the tall part that goes into the battery compartment of the D200. I've tried everything I can think of to make it work like it originally did, but nothing seems to help. I'm looking on eBay for one to replace it."
1,Disappointed 1st time with Nikon product,"Disgned for professional use? Cheap, breakage of battery clips. May be OK for the ocassional shooter (but why would they need this unit?); but not for pro work. Heavy (hand a finger cramping after 100 shots) and has a CHEAP feel. Easier to just carry 2 extra ENEL3e in your pocket."
3,A Mixed Bag,"In general, I like having the extra power with me, and I like the grip and the extra shutter button for vertical shots. What I don't like is that the unit is entirely plastic. Ok, on the one hand it doesn't add a whole lot of weight to the overall unit, but the bottom piece should at least be rubberized and/or metal like the camera body. While it adds a nice ergonomic feel to the camera, I feel that the plastic-ness of the pack ""cheapens"" the overall look of the camera. And if you tap on it, it sounds hollow. I am a former F3 user with the MD-4 motordrive, so I guess I am used to the added heft, and the tank-like construction which the MB-D200 clearly lacks."
4,Very good,"It does it's job very well. It is a bit flimsey, but if it is handled with some care, it should work fine for years. I am very pleased with it and will get another one for another model camera later. I do recommend this product to anyone who takes a lot of pictures."
5,"A little pricey, but worth it","An awesome extension for the D200. It doubles the operating time, and adds extra grip options for the camera."
5,Useful & reliable,The MB-200 in my opinionis a great addition to my Nikon D200. It gives me the assurance that I can take as many shots as I need to at an event (ie: weddings) without having to worry much about battery life. It does on the other hand add a bit of bulk & weight to the camera which may take some getting used to. I would reccomend it to all my fellow D200 users. Great product!
4,Forget about it,"Well - i like nikon stuff - but this thing is a cheap mess. It really can't be used on a tripod because it's not stiff enough to support the camera. The mount for the tripod socket will flex because it's made out of plastic. It's okay for adding vertical format controls. Unlike some other units this pac does nothing to improve camera performance. It's easier and lighter just to carry a spare battery. It does provide AA battery support which is why i wanted it. It could have been a whole lot better though and i expected something more like the old F100/MB-F100 combo. Really disappointing, but it is cheaper.."
4,Aaah... makes shooting verticals MUCH easier,"I've always hated how cumbersome it is to shoot verticals with 35mm and digital: having to contort one's arm over the head, twist the wrist, etc. This pretty much solves that problem. Granted, it is difficult to reach the thumb pad on the camera, but at least you can use the AF-On button and the front wheel to change focus areas. Build quality? I figure Nikon went with plastic to minimize weight and cost. I wish the latch on the battery door were a bit more robust, however.It changes the balance of the camera, making it feel much more 'centered', especially with my goto lens, the 18-200mm VR. It also is much better balanced with my SB-600 flash attached.Overall, I'd say this is a 'must have', probably the second accessory you should get after a flash unit. Oh yes, it also tends to command R-E-S-P-E-C-T from people, be that good or bad..."
3,Not quite up to par,This is the fourth Nikon battery holder and grip I have purchased. This particular grip has two plastic tits to hold the batteries inplace. They are very fragile and can be broken quite easily if batteries are not loaded properly. One should move the white tits aside when installing the battery to avoid breaking them off. I think the grip makes holding the camera more comfortably than without. I am not familiar with other manufacturer's products with which to compare this unit.
5,Help for the Confessing,"Although written to help priests be more effective and gentle, helpful confessors by gaining a deeper understanding of what their people are saying (or trying to say or hide )in confession this book can also help laity confused about the sacramment of reconciliation. It can show you clearer and more precise ways to express yourself, or how to ask your confessor for the kind of guidance this St. Meinrad's professor would have him offer. Confession is difficult for priests, Father Stasiak points out, because it is the only sacrament they can not watch others priests administer."
3,Only live cd of this band,Early concert of this band has ok quality and a lackluster college audience. It is the only live recording of the band I know of so that makes it a must have for Specials fans.I saw them in Boston on second tour and they brought the house down so I know how they can sound. Try the live dvd reunion concert.
5,Complete version of show-buy this edition,"This show is from Aston University in 1979. This is the full show, and is not cut like the later release on Castle Records with the same title. Part of the show also appears on Blue Plate Specials along with Coventry Automatics tracks. For some reason, the band is listed as the Toy Dolls at the time I did this review. That is incorrect."
2,Not very good.,"I think the people raving about this being such a great circle cutter must work in the PR dept. for OLFA, because cutting nice, clean circles is hit or miss with this. I bought this because cutting circles with scissors never results in clean edges. Cutting paper or fabric with this does not result in clean edges."
1,Useless for paper,"I bought this cutter to create perfect circles in 80lb cover weight paper. After spending over an hour with it and going through at least 10 sheets of paper, I can only say that it does indeed cut circles, but they are far from perfect. I am using a self healing cutting mat and the paper is taped down as well, but I can never get a clean edge. Never. I then tried a glass mat and the edges were better but never perfect. I would not recommend this for paper where you are looking for precise circles. It might be better for fabric like a few videos around show it doing, although I haven't tried it. I am going to try another brand."
4,NICE COMPACT CIRCLE CUTTER.,OLFA 1057028 CMP-3 Rotary Circle CutterI REALLY LIKE HOW COMPACT THIS CUTTER IS.I USE IT ON MAKING SMALL CARDS AND IT WORKS VERY WELL. I AM HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND IT
2,screaming is not singing,"i dont know this one didnt do it for me, a lot of screaming and pitchy notes just wasnt good enough."
1,progressive junk,save your money. if your looking for progressive rock pass on this crap. this cd is junk. spend your money on dream theater or some other prog groups with talent.the other reviews with 5 stars must have been written by DEVINS family members.
5,Absolutly Amazing,"When I bought this CD I had no idea what I was in for (I only bought it because I knew it wasn't a rap ,rnb or pop album, like all the cds in my local shop) I was aware of his work with Steve Vai and SYL. The intro track, Olives, sets a great mood and as soon as the scream at the start of Mountain hit me I knew I would love the album from start to finish. Devin's vocals range from low growls to lovely melodic lines. Devin and his band members, Gene Hogian (Drums), Graig McFarland (Fretless Bass) and Jamie Mayer (Keyboards/Piano) are all truely talented musicians. While there are no technically show-off solos their compositional skills are up there with the likes Dream Theater's Images And Words and Symphony X's The Odyssey. This album should not only be in progressive metal history but should be in music history all together."
2,Not easy to install,"Its not all that great, I wouldn't get it. Honestly I would return it if it didn't take so long to get it off. But I will see if it works at all, but do not get this product, it doesn't even come with the proper equipment."
4,I think the book was very nice and detailed.,From what i remember it was detailed which gave me the feeling to feel sympathy for those in the book. I have read other books written by Janette Oke and have enjoyed everyone just as much as this one.
2,Couldn't finish it,"This book is not the quality of work that I've come to expect from Janette Oke. I was very disappointed in it, and quit reading it about half way through. The characters were lovable and interesting, but I thought the plot dragged just a bit too much for me."
4,Julia's Last Hope,This book gives insight into the struggle a women in the west may have experienced. The whole series gives an amazing array of insights of what it was like for various women in the west during those times. I have enjoyed them all.
4,Julia's Hope,"Yet another good Janette Oke book! This one tells the story of Julia and her husband, along with their twin daughters. The mill in their small town is closing, and John (Julia's husband) works at the mill, along with basically all the men in the town. They have to decide what to do. Should they move? or fight to keep the town alive?I enjoyed this book, but felt that it was a little bit boring in some aspects (hence the 4 stars). In the end, John and Julia come to a decision and discover how important it is to keep the family together."
2,Was quite a letdown,"I have come accustomed to reading Janette Oke's thought-provoking books, but this one did none of the sort. This has little romance, which also surprises me, and the plot drags on and on; it never really seems to get anywhere to me. I read it in a day, but not because it was good, but because I just wanted to finish so I could read another book. I would not recommend this one."
2,Misinformation-Buyer Beware!,"Well, I love both of these movies (the only good ones out of all five) but this set is terrible. The video is compressed, and there are almost no extras. Just some lame production notes and a trailer for Beethoven's 2nd. Also, Amazon says this is a 2-disc set when it is only on one disc. It's also a double sided disc, and it doesn't even say side 2. If you like the movies and just want the movies then this is fine, but beware that this DVD is pretty terrible."
1,What's wrong with Universal?,"I've been trying to find ""Beethoven"" (the first) in widescreen format for a long time and for some idiotic reason Universal Studios won't release it in WS. I bought the VHS long time ago and I was hoping this dvd would bring this good movie in the original WS format for a better experience in the newer flat screen tv sets but no, it comes in full screen format. Who cares for full screen nowadays? Thumbs down to Universal."
2,Greene thinks about Planet of the Apes waaay too much!,"I can see Eric Greene at a party. Someone asks him ""what would you like to write a book about?"" Eric replies ""the underlying messages of race & politics in the Planet of Apes movies"". There is a general stirring of nostalgia among the crowd. Comments like ""I loved those movies as a kid"", ""That ending- wow!"" are heard. The crowd urges Eric to go on and share his ideas. Four hours later, Eric is still going on about minute hidden symbolic meanings in what were essentially B pictures. A few stragglers from the crowd remain, numb and glassy eyed.Would have liked the book more if it had about half the politicizing and twice the trivia. Shallow but true."
3,So-So,"This book does a good job in explaining many of the subtexts that exist in the ""Planet of the Apes"" movie series. The major drawbacks to the book is 1) its constant PC mindset and 2) its overreaching to read subtexts where there are probably none. A good example of the latter is in chapter 4 and the author's (unintentionally) hilarious wrestling with what a school bus symbolized in ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"". Instead of going on and on trying to do all sorts of contortions to explain it, maybe the author should look at the possibility that maybe the bus was JUST A BUS!"
4,More fun than Uno ever was,"Looks like nintendo really knows what the e-reader can be used for. While all other e-reader cards thus far were either completely dependant upon the e-reader for fun or barely used the e-reader (pokemon-e cards only sport extras), Mario Party-e is fun as a standalone game or with the e-reader! The card game is fun and the mini games make the game crazy.My brother and I played a bunch of times the other day. Just as i thought i would win- a minigame resulted in him taking all my progress. the lead switches hands at the whim of minigames. The whole experience is fun and each game is different."
2,"Nice seat, not so great mounting system and flimsy hinge covers",3 seats in 3 years due to broken hinge covers.. Not worth the price. The conventional mounting bolts don't hold the seat firmly in place and keep loosening so the seat lists.
3,Comfortable but a little cheap,"I find this seat comfortable for my normal sized butt, even for extended periods of time. Sometimes, you just want to escape from your family and this is the perfect place to do it. It matches my existing Kohler by size and color. However, they do use plastic hinges and bolts, this allows for a little side to side play if you wiggle it with your hand. However, I do not notice this movement when sitting on my throne.User Tip! If you are heavy, do not sit on the closed lid, it is plastic and may deform or crack. (Thus the reason I am buying a replacement seat)."
3,Improper Seat Anchors,Although the seat meets expatations the seat anchors do not. My Kohler toilet uses seat anchor sleeves to anchor the anchors into the bowl because there are no hole exits on the bottom of the bowl. I am having a very difficult time finding these anchors.
3,Expected More,"Kohler has a good reputation. I was pleased to find the color that matched my toilet at a reasonable price. I bought this toilet seat in Nov. 2009, and yesterday, just over 3 years later, it broke. I looked up the warranty and of course it was only for a year. I expected a longer lasting toilet seat from Kohler, so I give it only 3 stars. The design was easy to clean and comfortable, but now I have to replace it again."
2,Coating peels and plastic discolors,We purchased our very nicely maintained house this past spring and it came with two Kohler one piece toilets. The master bath toilet has this white seat installed. The plastic coating (a thin film that seems to have a slightly sparkly luster to it) is peeling off the seat in several places at the inner edge. The seat cover has discolored on the inside from its original white to a yellowish hue. I would not recommend this seat for its lack of durability.
3,Fasteners NOT included,"Great seat. Comfortable. However, if you need to fasten it to the base of your toilet (and you do) then you need to spend upwards of $40 to buy the fasteners which are not sold in stores. Why are these not included? Total joke. Luckily, my husband is a handy guy and he figured out how to fasten this using anchor screws from the hardware store. A little work and some trial error but our toilet is now functional thanks to the Home Depot. Just be aware of this before you buy or you will be disappointed when your toilet seat arrives."
5,Best Lozenger out there,I am a Diabetic and these Lozengers get used to but they work with the first one.I've told many people about them. It takes getting used to but once you see how fast it works you never want anything else for your throat.
5,Even better than the regular ones,"I've always liked the original Fisherman's Friend product. These are a nice upgrade, because the mint flavor is pronounced and there's no sugar in them. They don't leave that icky feeling in your mouth and tongue the way sugar does, and the mint is a nice change from the old fashioned licorice flavor of the originals."
4,Way better than Madonna's version,"Kelly Osbourne's version of ""Papa Don't Preach"" is way better than Madonna's original version. Kelly has a stronger voice, and the song is faster-paced, rather than slow and rhythmic. Recommended for those who enjoy today's music."
4,Global Heresy or Rock My World,"I enjoyed this film very much. Peter OToole and Joan Plowright were funny and endearing. The other cast members were also good. Story was a little unrealistic, but it was fun to watch. A very light-hearted movie."
3,Entertaining,"This movie was much better than I expected, but not to Alicia Silverstone's credit. Peter O'Toole, Joan Plowright and the band's cast of characters are very amusing here. I found the movie quite funny and oddly enough the band was so good I'd buy the soundtrack if it existed. Alicia is basically a bump on a log here but her bandmates are believable actors so i recommend it as a fun rock flick."
2,Profanity,"I suppose we are old ""sticks-in-the-mud"", but to us the use of the ""F"" wordis not necessary. Though we guess it is common in the rock culture of today."
1,Forget the DVD where's the CD?!,"Not a terribly interesting movie unless you're really bored, the real reason to sit throught this is for the music. Why oh why isn't there a soundtrack? Casino is brilliant! I don't care very much for the movie and yet I've sat throught it four times just to hear this band. Do they have any cds?"
4,rocked my world,"I stumbled across this movie while flipping around my HBO-type channels. I stopped when I heard the music although I had no idea what I was watching. I was surprised the see Peter O'Toole and Joan Plowright in these roles but they seemed to be having fun!! I like when actors take on tongue in cheek roles and don't mind stepping down a bit.I made sure I caught the full movie next time it was showing. I must admit that I found the movie fun to watch. You didn't have to think, you didn't have the melodrama or depressing attitudes of today's movies. You just sit and enjoy the movie and the music."
4,[Four of Four stars] Another very fine video by Health expert Lorraine Day,"Seeing how much these Lorraine DayVHS tapes are now going for on goodold amazon.com, I am glad I found onehere in Chesapeake, VA for .95 centsat the local Children's Hospital ofthe King's Daughter's! A very goodholistic / naturalistic approach totrying to first avoid cancer, thenfight it the best posible way if youhappen to get this drede disease!Any of Lorraine's book and tapesare worth getting!"
1,Dr. Day's Conspiracy Theories,"Please, before you purchase anything by this author, do an online search of her paranoid and delusional anti-Semitism. Dr. Day, on her various sites, claims that Jews seek to exterminate and enslave the entire non-Jewish world, that the Holocaust did not happen, and that the Hebrew word ""goyim"" (""nations"") literally means ""cattle."" Seriousely, this woman's various online sites, as well as that of her huaband, retired congressman William Dannemeyer, contain the most outrageous slanders against the Jewish people.Besides that issue, her medical ideas really do border on quackery.I'm just saying: Do your research before you get suckered in by this fraud."
4,Colostomy,"She has the best voice in the world. She was only 14. She had braces just like me... it helped me get through some awkward adolescent years. Great songs. She should still be singing somewhere today, somehow somehwere. Passionate, raw, heart-felt. No image, no pretense. Special."
3,No choice but surrender,it was okay...brienne sometimes annoying because she is so weak...wished we could have read more about Avenel's thoughts and feeling...did the author write a book on Ralph Harcourt?
4,Loved it!,"If not exactly a classic bodice ripper, pretty darn close, and in this age of very PC writing that at times borders on the bland, I must confess I just loved this book. No, it is not for everyone and has its share of flaws, but it's escapist reading and for me that's what makes for an entertaining novel. Why not five stars? I agree with one reviewer's point that the author doesn't give us enough ""warm-fuzzy"" time with the lead characters considering all the angst that they lived through. But I'm definitely going to read more by this author."
3,Disappointing.,"This is the first time I am writing about a book I didn't like.I just finished reading it and I did enjoy it until the moment Brienne gave into Avenel again after she knew he only seduced her to get even with her father. What a spineless woman! Where was her self respect? That she even spoke to Cumberland and Rose after was ridiculous, since they knew of his plans all along....PLEASE! I forced myself to finish the book and then pitched it."
5,All American Bluegrass Girl!!,"The Queen of Bluegrass strikes gold again!With beautiful ballads like Forever Ain't That Long Anymore,Prettiest Flower There(so sweet) and the excellent Precious Jewel.Also included are 2 songs for the US soldiers God Bless The Soldier and Till They Come Home-both very touching.Other standouts is the fantastic Rhythm Of The Wheels,the ballad Midnight Angel feat Bobby Osborne and Don't Act.Another gem of an album from Rhonda Vincent.You can't go wrong with this.."
3,some good bluegrass,christmas gift came very timely and in excellent condition.first studio cd of rhonda's. some good stuff but not up to level with ragin live which is terrific.
1,Gets on my nerves,"After about three songs this album gets on my nerves...big time! What the hell is this...all of the songs sound the same. Try Dale Ann Bradley and Claire Lynch, their blue grass albums are not annoying like this one."
2,"Average songs, average voice","If you've listened to Alison Krauss, you've heard the best. Rhonda's arrangements and voice were adequate, but nothing special, and I doubt I'll listen to the CD again."
5,I am at a lost for words.,"Dragon Quest 8 is the best RPG game I have ever played. I am totally speechless. The graphics are excellent. The music is enchanting and the story is in depth. Dragon Quest 8 is very irrestible to walk away from and the player will never get bored. For example, there are these endless sidequests to play. Plus, when a player thought they mastered the game. The plot changes and you will find yourself in a bigger quest than anyone would have imagined."
5,Great Old School Fun,"If you like old school RPG's, then you will love Dragon Quest 8: Journey of the Cursed King. Gorgeous graphics, a wonderful soundtrack, great vocals, all tied up with wonderful old-school gameplay. Combat is simple but can be surprisingly difficult. A simple but serviceable story takes you through a quest that can last anywhere from 50-70 hours depending on how much you want to accomplish. A wonderful adventure!"
4,Pretty good game,I love RPG's and I actually bought this game entirely for the demo of FFXII inside! I played it pretty much all the way through past where you beat the game the first time. I kept my attension pretty well but the cartoonish graphics are pretty cheasy so if your looking for great spectacles in the games you play I wouldn't buy this one. Overall the story is pretty good and fun to play!
2,Don't Be Eaten By The Hype Machine,"I was so psyched to play this game. Every review and reviewer going on and on about this game and how great it is.This game totally sucks. It feels like you're playing a terrible MMORPG, hour upon hour upon hour of level grinding and no story to boot. Except, this isn't even as fun as an MMORPG (which I can't stand by the way) because character customization is almost totally absent and what little their is (the skill system) is pretty much useless!I played this game for 20 hours before finally sitting back, sighing and saying ""this game totally bites."" Don't waste your time and your money on this game.There's a reason why this series never got popular outside of Japan. And it's because it's horrible."
1,I enjoyed it while it lasted,The game didn't work after I have a 3rd person added to my team. Then the screen turns black and never returns back to the game. Oh well.
2,This game sucks,there is no story and everything about it is just incredibly boring. who cares about good graphics and sound if the there is no point to the game. overrated.
1,Only one other 1 star review??,"I can not believe this awful game only has one other 1 star review.It is LONG.It is BORING. The plot is paper thin with no real character development at all. There are no plot twists, no surprises, NOTHING engaging.The voice acting is hokey and silly.It is overly hard and dungeons get leaps and bounds harder without warning. You HAVE to level build between each quest or forget getting any further.I have played many RPGs and I have never hated one as much at this game. I really can not think of one good thing to say about it."
5,Great storyline and graphics,"I have a short attention span, and my husband is constantly trying to find a game that will keep me entertained for more than one session. I was so obsessed with this game that I wanted to play almost everyday. The graphics are great-vibrant and fluid. The storyline was enough of a plot to keep me entertained, without feeling like I was being dragged through a boring story. There is definite humor in the dialogue, with varying ages of comprehension. Overall, for a girl who doesn't normally like video games, this was a keeper!"
1,Move along little doggy,"While this game was colorful and pretty easy I stopped playing it about the time your party ends up going to the king and the king 'checks out' the female in the party. The screen focuses on her bust area and her bottom area . There are other comments up to this point that are inappropriate for children and teens . I just thought ""Really?"" Dissapointed since this was the first dragon quest that I had ever played even though I often saw them on the SNES in Japan. I sold my copy."
3,Ugggh,"I'm used toDragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosenfor the DS, so I went and tried this out for a while.Twenty four hours in and I'm already falling asleep. So much travel, not enough happening to keep me engaged... Maybe I'm just so used to the older titles likeChrono Trigger,Final Fantasy IX,Earthboundand younger games likeEternal Sonatawhere there's stuff happening all the time as opposed to the looooonnnng amounts of time that you need to take to travel from Point A to Point B while waiting for the Alchemy Pot to finish cooking.... Ugggghhh.This game wasn't made for me. I did enjoy the time I spent playing it, but my time is better spent on other games."
3,Good game; a little tedious,"This is a fun game. It has a lot of interesting little elements that help you to remain interested in the game which can be tedious at times. The random battles are a bit excessive. The story is pretty basic, but fairly entertaining. The voice acting is good, but they speak very slowly and you can read through the dialog at about 4x the speed - thankfully you can skip through at your own pace. The music is beautiful, but also repetitive after a while."
3,An honest review,"I bought this game. It is pretty fun. I haven't played the other ones in the series. I like the interesting story line. The graphics are okay. The game doesn't give you many choices. For instance, all the quests are planned out for you. The player ins't given a choice of where they get to go. The voices are good. The voices match the chareacters. It is pretty simple to play. There are plenty fo chances to gain expereince and levels. The monsters spawn frequently. Overall it is pretty good."
2,Slow,"I've played DQ games before and many other RPG's. And this game advances so slowly. But then there are a million things to do, if that's what you want.To be more specific - level ups are slow in higher levels, and you get to the point where you have to beat bosses to advance because the regular monsters aren't worth enough. There's no fast track to the end of the story line and the side quests are a neccessary part of building up.Then there's the alchemy pot. Nice idea. Nice way to get new items. But, you end up stopping constantly to reload the pot. Or to figure out what you can make.Also, when exploring, you do get attacked a little too often.I played this 70 hours and got what looks like about half to 2/3rds through and couldn't sit through it any more. (Played the other popular new game over 150 hours and completed the entire story line and many side quests.)"
4,Awesome game.,Had a lot of fun playing this. It quickly became one of my favorites. My only regret is selling my PlayStation 2 for crack money.
5,DQ Lover States the Obvious,"This game is great. A credit to the series. Don't ask me though, read the hundreds of gaming reviews online."
4,Recovering DQ8 addict,"The only game in this series that I have previously played was the original Dragon Warrier. I played the hell out of that game. This is everything a modern RPG should be: great graphics and character design, a huge world, & an easily managable upgrade system.I could list several complaints that would all fall in the category of ""that is essential to what an RPG is"". I beat the game and the additional quest. All together I played for 100+ hours. I think it was a great way to spend 4+ days.If you like RPGs and hate unneccessary cut scenes that add nothing to the story, but look pretty, then this is your game.My only fear is that after spending so much time in this game I expect that DQ9 will eat up a larger chunk of my life."
4,a masterpiece in the traditional sense,"This game doesn't break any rules and does t push any boundaries. That was true even when it first came out in 2008. but everything it does do, it does exceptionally well. Soundtrack, art, gameplay are all great. Be warned this is a game for the purest RPG fans. If rpgs have turned you off in the past steer clear of this one, it can get boring if you're not gung-ho about turn based battles"
2,Moved a little Slow,"I have to admit that I didn't finish this book. I got tired of it and jumped to the end to find out 'who did it.' I never,ever,ever cheat like that, and the fact that I did says a lot.I liked the story. I liked the moments of high tension. The problem was that between the high points was pages and pages of boredom. I ended up skimming the book for the good parts and skipping the rest."
4,Romantic suspense novel,"Twice Burned was a wonderful romantic murder mystery that I highly recommend. The author, Jan Coffey, did an excellent job in holding my interest and making the book very hard for me to put down! Great writing, easy read and a book I highly recommend. I'll be looking for more of Ms. Coffey's books."
1,No exchanges.,"My order arrived in a timely manner, but wasn't accompanied by any sort of invoice or return information. After finding the information on line, I returned the pants, which didn't fit, requesting the next size up. I received an e-mail shortly thereafter stating that an exchange wasn't possible, and that I'd have to re-place an order via Amazon or the web site. These pants run small. I don't know why an exchange wasn't possible, since the size I needed was in-stock, but I probably won't re-order since shipping is not refunded and I had to pay to return the product."
2,Do not purchase based on picture shown...,"My daughter has to wear these pants for work BUT the only style that fits her well is the Dickies BULL pant. I got into a hurry and ordered 2 prs. from merchant but didn't compare style numbers. I went by the photo shown which is the bull pant photo. The pants were a bit slow to arrive and needless to say, we were sorely disappointed as the style we received runs WAY smaller than the Bull pant that we were expecting. Merchant did let me return pants but I paid double shipping which makes me sick in this economy. Be careful when you order online to compare everything which was my fault, I'm ashamed to admit."
1,Never again,"I ordered these pants and when I received them, which took awhile, they were the wrong size. I tried multiple times to contact the vendor to return them with no response. Then I had no choice but to keep them and eat the money. I would never order from this vendor again."
4,Dickies OG Low Rider pants,not as low as you might think... check measurements. Also - be sure you want the stiff or stretch material. BIG difference in fit and form. No exchange option - had to re-order... Dickies are always quality products as far as I'm concerned.
5,Dickies Girl OG Low Rider Pants,I was completely pleased with the item I had ordered. I have ordered Dickies Girl OG Low Rider pants multiple times from amazon and am yet to be disappointed. I wear these pants for work and will continue to order them for as long as I work at my current job.
1,Stay Away from Totally Bamboo!,I bought two of their other endgrain cutting boards and both bowed and cracked in under a month of use. The second of the two boards was oiled 3 times in that one month period and still cracked and bowed. Bamboo also stains much faster than traditional cutting boards do.STAY AWAY!
1,"Looks great, but doesn't last.","I ordered this board after reading a recommendation in Cooks Illustrated. It is a nice, heavy weight, with beautiful color variations and the end grain pattern. BUT...I've only had it for three weeks, and it is already splitting! I replaced a straight grain board with this one because end grain isn't supposed to split. Well, it does.I guess if you wanted to leave it on a shelf or otherwise use it as decoration, this board would be fine. If, however, you actually CUT on your cutting board, avoid this one. Choose one of the new composite boards instead. What they lack in esthetics they make up for in functionality - they even go in the dishwasher!"
3,It's OK,"this album is alright but i didn't realize how ""melodic"", (Lame, boring, and pretentious),this album would be, the vocals are womanly, and not in a good way. The keyboards sound like the same ones I heard on Graveworm which is another mediocre ""melodic"" (w/keyboards) ""death metal"" band. Some of the songs are hard and well produced but the ballads have to go, it reminded me of Angra, eeeeeewwwwwwwww."
4,very odd....,"this is one of the strangest records i've ever heard. the production is terrible. the female singer is almost unlistenable. but the songs are fantastic! as a whole, this beautifully confused thing manages to sound both spooky and goofy at the same time -- not an easy trick...."
4,happily sappy,"Really pretty songs in an 80's synth-pop kind of way. Except they make me smile, not cringe (except ""tokyo a go-go"" which actually is pretty cringeworthy). They DON'T sound a thing like Berlin or Mister Mister, don't get me wrong... But the songs somehow DO give me the same goopy feeling I had when I was a lovesick twelve-year-old listening to those bands! Go on, be sappy, get this."
5,Incomparably gorgeous,"This album was my introduction to The Magnetic Felds and, though I apparently may be one of a very few people in the world who feel this way, it has remained in my top three favorite albums of all time. All subsequent MF albums have been varying degrees of disappointments (though beguiling, nonetheless,) because of the bar this album set for me. Tokyo A Go Go is the only song I would willingly fast-forward through. Tar-Heel Boy I could also take or leave, but every other song is a stunner. The retro synths and ""wall of sound"" arrangements forge a distinct space that is both melancholic and disco and, most importantly, create a timeless frame for Anway's vocals, which manage to be simultaneously distant and urgent while conveying what I think are some of Stephen Merritt's strongest works lyrically. These songs shimmer with subtle profundity, longing and ache, playfulness and wistfulness. This is absolute poetry that operates on many levels, disguised as art-pop."
3,Good but not Great,"After listening to this album, one gets the impression that Susan Amway must be under strict orders from Monsieur Merritt not to show any emotion whatsoever. This can occasionally have a pleasant effect (""Railroad Boy"") but mostly, it just grates. There are enough great songs here, however, to cover for it. ""Old Orchard Beach"" especially has some wonderfully intricate rhythms underneath the squeaking in the synthesizers, and the hilariously dinky intro to ""Falling in Love with the Wolfboy"" gets me every time. This is an album worth sampling, but I wouldn't buy it unless I were a completist (which I am)."
4,The cool night air,"This is a pretty pair of albums, and well worth your yen or dollar. Let's say that Phil Spector and a sad Abba and independent production got jumbled up in a more often than not melancholy and nostalgic mood, and in a lost and lonely bedsit universe it touched hearts and went to number one after everyone bought a copy to take home. I think you'll have something like this Magnetic Fields collection. You could yearn a little to these sounds."
4,Good Family Viewing.,"It is a simple mouse story, no need to analyze. It is simply good animation and entertainment for all ages, kids to Granma."
2,double feature?? not.,I bought this mainly for the Fievel Goes West to show in my history class. There was only one movie and it wasn't Fievel Goes West....go figure :/
4,....,I grew up with these movies and bought them for my kids they love them and getting to watch them again was nice too.
1,A total ripoff !!!! 89 pages of typos. I went to the cleaners !,"With so little one can find about the lives aboardship of our tiny but powerful navy in the war of 1812, I thought "" AAHHH , at last, someone's written about the impressive, if few, shipboard actions that we DID have!"" Guess again! I mean, REALLY! 89 pages of typos about the mostly hapless misadventures of those poor misguided american sailor boys. I'm just so ""bloody"" weary of reading about the heroics of the ""bloody"" King's navy!!! Does Anyone have a list of authors who write about OUR heros and battles?..real or immagined? Maybe some really talented authors of fiction? ie brain ratteling broadside exchanges at sea, where you can taste the powder & smoke. Where is OUR Hornblower, Richard Sharp or Captain Bolitho? Nothing against the ""Bloody British"" they were a brave lot."
4,"Of course, from Marquez I expect to be in awe, and always am","Marquez breifly meet Hemingway. Actually he saw him from across the street. He said Hemingway had a passion and relentless fever to write, unsurpassed by no other writer in history. Marquez considers Hemingway to be worthy of his aspirations. It is clear however, in this collection of his short stories, that Marquez needs little improvement in producing images that express passions and feelings deep enough and rich enough to drink. Marquez sets the scene, with the use of a small amount of words. The language is acurrate, and filled with immediate images for the reader. Gabriel Garcia Marquez's short stories exemplify the authors control of his language, and ability to produce such memorable moods and emotions with such little amounts of letters.Translated from Spanish or not, the images are still there. Hemingway has a rival in dynamic simplicity."
4,"""Collected Stories""","""Collected Stories"" is a collection of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's short stories spanning 25 years. Some of the stories at the beginning of the collection were a bit repetitive, but it shows his progression as a writer. A good read, especially when one doesn't have much time for novels."
4,Occultists and Academics,"Reading the end of this book was a definite epiphany for me. I had just finished a postgraduate degree in English and found myself drawn into the story at a rapid rate. Three academics become convinced that they have discovered a once-every-120-years meeting of seemingly every secret society, occult sect, and cabal. As they combine a thousand threads of evidence, their efforts begin to mimic the goal of the occultists they are following: to become aware of the unknown, to be a member of the inner circle, to know the great secret. As I was about to enter a life in academia myself, I found this idea more than a little disturbing. While this is not a book for those who like straightforward mysteries with clear solutions, the book is stronger because it does not placate its readers with easy answers. Although it toys with the idea."
5,brilliant,"Just brilliant, I read it in his Spanish version 7 years ago; hey I was at that time a freshman student and had no knowledge of a lot of things. I just did not stop in every detail, and let me assure you, it is not necessary to comprehend the whole story. Don't bother having dictionaries and stuff, just follow the story bypassing the details.3 years ago I read it for the second time, I found a lot more things than the first time, it was quite refreshingnow I have studied a little of Kabbalah and felt the need to read it again, it is amazing how much you learn when you read the book carefully, but hey, don't do it the first time, you don't have to and if you are not intellectually patient and curious you will certainly get bored of stopping again and again"
3,The Italian version is MUCH better,I can understand what the 'one-star reviews' are refering to when they equate reading this book to 2 months of hard labour. The English version is not a pleasure to read due to the faulty translation.Do not kill the writer for it'was the messenger who changed the text.
2,reader from Israel,I wish I could give this book a stronger review then 2 stars but that is already being generous. Mr. Eco really drew me in with the ' Name of the Rose' and I expected more of the same with this title . Such was not the case. Being a Hebrew speaker and novice cabalist I thought I had a better chance of grasping this work then most others.... perhaps slightly but the overall read was laborious and painful. To say I did not get would be accurate. I have one more book by him to read and I'm hoping that this next one delivers a better rate of return.Mr. Eco is a wonderful writer all in all and if I had to pick someone to be deserted on an island with he would be a good choice.
4,A book to savor again and again,"Some books are to be read quickly, enjoyed and discarded. This is definitely not one of those books. It is dense with ideas and forces the reader to think. This is a book to read, think about,then put on a shelf to be brought down later to experience again.The premise of the story is clever - three bored editors decide to play a game. They string together the bizarre conspiracy theories they have heard and possibly stumble on the real thing. This has been done before in other books and movies. What make this different is the amount of information layered in the story. This book has lead me to many late night internet searches."
4,Eco must be laughing,"I will start by saying that this book is incredibly dense, as most reviewers have mentioned. However, if you are willing to not understand every last historical and occult reference, this book is absolutely fascinating. I fell completely into Eco's trap. I tried to follow his descriptions of the occult, puzzling out what it could all mean. I was intrigued by hints at ""the Plan"" and attempted to figure out just what this plan could be. Upon reaching the end of the novel, I felt like I had been duped, but brilliantly so. There is no plan, it is all fiction, yet I, just like characters such as Aglie and Bramanti, had fallen into the trap of believing. Eco truly got the last laugh."
5,thought-provoking read,"Foucault's Pendulum, by the author of The Rame of the Rose, is a wonderul read. It's filled with great descriptive passages, well-drawn characters, a non-linear storyline, and thoughts of conspiracy that would overwhelm some readers of The da Vinci Code, I suspect. The main characters are in pursuit of the long-lost secrets of the Knights Templar. Does it lead to their own un-doing? Read it and find out! Be prepared for depth, as opposed to action."
1,Incomprehensible,"I thought I was dumb when I read over three fourths of this gobbledygook and didn't understand more than a line. However, one odd day I chanced across a collection of essays of Salman Rushdie in a bookshop and was flipping through the pages when I came across by chance Rushdie's review of the book.In short Rushdie said that he read the whole book and didn't understand a single sentence of the book. What a relief - the author of the booker of bookers said not a sentence...So here I am pride salvaged - and writing this review.Piece of advice for anyone considering picking this up - unless you have a Ph.D in theology AND a masters degree in occult faiths, you may not appreciate this book.Sandeep"
1,Convoluted and Misguided,"This is simply a bad book. The way the author teeters between humor and mystery is just too frustrating; the mystery gets too bogged down in silly details and, as a result, kills any satirical element to the story. It's as if someone was making Raiders of the Lost Ark with the Three Stooges in place of Indiana Jones. The only chapter I really enjoyed was the description on how the main characters swindle Self Financing Authors."
4,Thought-Provoking but Somewhat Tedious,"This was a story that I gained much from on a personal level, but it did get a little hard to plunge through the more complex and dense parts. I recommend this book to anyone, though, because my life became simpler after reading this. If I can read anything I want to into the world, all I can say in the end is ""It's so beautiful."""
5,Fantastic book informed by history,A masterpiece of fantasy and history beautifully combined in a story that will keep you on your toes from cover to cover.
5,The Pendulum Keeps Swinging,"Adding that the book is fresher and livlier today than at publication. For everyone who's been trained by DaVinci codes, here's the next and much higher step."
4,A note,"One aspect of this book not entirely covered here is the ambiguity between what is real and what illusion (or, fiction). One of the excellent aspects of this book is the way it raises and presses that question"
2,Dear Publisher: PLEASE PROOFREAD!,"I find it annoying and ironic that a book about a group of book editors is digitized so sloppily. Apparently, the publisher is too lazy/greedy to pay someone to read through the book to fix the numerous typographical errors. Really unprofessional; shame on you, Houghton Mifflin.As for the story itself, I loved it."
4,"deeply gripping-hard to put down, enjoyable yet dense",I highly reccommend this to anyone who enjoyed the Illuminatus trilogy by Robert Shea/Robert Anton Wilson. This book is to the Illuminatus Trilogy like The Hobbit is to The Trilogy of the Rings. Esoteric history and good character development make this a good read ....
2,why?,"This review reveals a bit of the ending, so don't read it if you don't want the ending spoiled. (Though by the time you get to the end you're just glad to be there).One of my (too many) hobbies is esoterica. So a book like this should have been a treat. I can follow more of the arcane references than the average reader, I reckon.But the book is all intellect and no imagination or soul. The plot is not interesting or believable. Nor are the characters. The characters don't even care about each other. (At the end, the narrator's best friend is hung by a group of theosophists and the narrator doesn't intervene or get upset but simly engages in abstract speculation.)Read it for the few chapters on the history of the templars, and for the overview of esoterica. But not for the plot, or the theme, or the characters, or for any other reason you normally read a book."
1,Just plain boring; author's cleverness kills the story . .,"The book is filled with irrelevant information. If the author's objective was to prove that he is a top notch intellectual - he had succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. However, the entertainment this book is not!"
1,"Too complicated, Too long","I decided to try this book because this book came highly recommended, I battled my way through 300 pages, and at no time did I enjoy the book. Reading it became more like a chore than an enjoyment so I gave up.The book is full of obscure historical references, people, events and places. And to understand the significance of these events one would have to be an expert on the last one thousand years of European history. The language was too complicated and academic, and the book was about 200 pages too long. Just when I thought an ineteresting scene was developing, the main character goes off to Brazil, and wastes a couple of dozen pages undergoing some cultural experience, whose meaning was lost to me.I'm not saying this is a bad book, because I could see that for someone who can follow it and understand it they could get a lot out of it, but be warned potential readers THIS IS ONE TOUGH READ, if you feel up to it get the book, if you have your doubts don't waste the money."
3,Too Much to be believed!,"I am a big fan of Umberto Eco. ""The Name of the Rose"" is one of my all-time favourite books, so I was looking forward to reading this one. Eco is an excellent writer. His craftmanship cannot be beat, but this book disappointed me. The premise was a good one, but to me it just didn't seem to get there. I didn't grow to care about the characters, and there was too much symbolism and ""off the wall"" ideas for my taste. I read the entire book because Eco is such a good author, and I thought I'd get the point, but I never really did, and was very disappointed at the end."
2,Just re-iterating comments made below...,"...that the book, regardless of how satisfying you might find the effort to read it or the diversity of information it contains, is dragged down by the pomposity of authorial tone and the sheer cultter of intellectual tidbits and arcane facts. Eco seems to be simply puffing out what could have been a tighter and more absorbing story in order to impress us with his intellectualism. Kind of like how Ayn Rand let her stories bend under the weight of her proselytising. OK, you're a smart guy, Mr. Eco; now write a *good* book. And in the meantime, if one wants good academic/literary mysteries, consult Robertson Davies or ""The Club Dumas""..."
2,NOT The Name of the Rose,"For those of you who loved The Name of the Rose, don't read this book, it is a mess. If you want to read other works by Umberto Eco, you'll just be disappointed. I suggest that you would have a better time rereading The Name of the Rose."
2,Disappointed with Foucault's Pendulum,Foucault's Pendulum had an exciting beginning but then piffled out as it became repetitious and seemed to have lost the thread.
4,Somewhat faulty typing...,"Foucault's pendulum is a marvellous book - like all of Umberto Eco's novels.My only grievance with this - and other e-books - is that often the typography tends to be less than perfect. C's turn out to be e's, words are somehow abbreviated or appear in two parts etc. Pity - and slightly annoying..."
5,Faucalts Pendulum,"EXCELLENT quality book, shipped perfectly. My 88 year old mother LOVED it for her birthday and spend many hour reading the book and telling me interesting parts of it as she read it. With shipping the book was 1/2 the price of a new one, and it was in truly NEW condition.Thank you."
5,"The game is still going, at least for some of us","This book is full of alternitive realities, depending on your point of view of course. Don't be affraid to be sucked into the game it can only show you a side of you never befored explored. Or you can look the other way, the game will still go on, enjoy it."
2,an observation about these reviewers,"I tried to read this book several times once it came out in paperpack. I could never seem to get past 25 or so pages.After reading a wide selection of reviews in here I find it encouraging that there are still people around who will admit that, even after struggling though an excruciating book of this size and style, they still have enough humanity to admit that it wasn't worth it for them and might not be for many others either."
2,I think the Pendulum needs another push.,"Sadly, this is a book that fails to live up to its enormous potential. I picked it up thinking I would get pleasure out this book billed as the ""thinking man's Da Vinci Code."" However, the extremely dense prose makes it largely unaccessible to anyone who doesn't have Eco's academic credentials. Obviously, Eco intended the conspiracy ""Plan"" to be confusing to most people, but my God, 400 pages of confusion is a bit much. The ending had the potential to reconcile everything, but sadly the climax left me wanting. I won't reveal anything, but he used one of the worst story-telling techniques out there. <Sigh>In a great twist of irony, Eco's central thesis--that intellectual superiority makes one a fool--backfires as his overly dense novel makes a fool of him, and me for reading 640 pages of confusion."
1,An Italian James Fennemore Cooper,"This book was a total waste of time. It reads like something that would have been written by James Fennemore Cooper. That is to say it takes a bulldozer to plow through it. Like another reviewer, the best part was finishing it. I thought it would get better as I went along, but I was wrong. It was difficult to absorb anything from it. The only reason I completed it was to say I finished it. Even at page 500 or 642 I thought of giving up. Possibly the worst book I've ever read. I will never read anything by Eco again, even though I enjoyed The Name of the Rose."
2,Read the reviews before you buy....,"I read The Name of the Rose many years ago and when I was looking for something to read and saw Foucault's Pendulum I thought why not. After slogging through it for several days and not really enjoying it I decided to check the reviews. It seems people either love or hate this book. It's wordy, tedious and if there is a plot in there somewhere it's hiding really well. It is rare for me to start a book and not finish it, even if I don't like it. However, as read primarily for pleasure and as I get older I see that's a rather foolish approach to reading. So, I'm putting Foucault's Pendulum away, even though I've read 66% of it. If you're thinking about this book read the reviews and the samples before making a purchase. Or better yet, get it at the library."
3,"Read ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" First","If I had not read the above first, I think F's P would have harder to follow. This reads a lot like a novelized version of the Baigent/Leigh/Lincoln book. I wish the novel had started with the visit by Col Ardenti and stuck to that story line. But, Eco is a professor and is probably using this as a forum for his philosophies. He is also writing for a more intellectual audience. I think the hype was a little overblown, though. I would recommend it if you don't mind not being able to finish it in one read. It's a book that makes you think so you read a few chapters, put it down, then start again."
3,Be careful with the Kindle edition,"I have little to say that adds to other reviewers regarding the content of this book, but I do have a little warning for you. For those who buy the Kindle Edition, know that there are MANY instances where the letter C is substituted for the letter E. In other words, I see a lot of 'thc' when it should be 'the'. I see a few 'thcsc' instead of 'these'. It doesn't make the book unreadable, but it does take a while to get used to it. Just a heads-up for you all.Ron"
3,"too much, too much, too much...","After reading The Name of the Rose and enjoying it quite a bit, I was interested to try Foucault's Pendulum which is a classic work in its own right. However, I found the book very hard to follow for the first half because of the constant discussions between the main characters about all the Occult esoterica and mainstream theology they learned over their careers as if they're competing with each other on who knows the most arcane detail. Their discussions, planning, scheming and research just seemed so grandiose, so overwhelmingly demonstrative that the long esoteric debates muted away the rest of the story to develop in the background so the ending seems abrupt and evokes little reaction from the reader. When it came, my reaction was ""oh well, there's the end."" Perhaps I missed something in this book..."
3,So What...,"Tedious, convoluted, pedantic, and frustrating. Eco should have let this one distill in his head for another half a decade or so before he put it on paper. The worst thing about it is that it has all the elements of being great with no real synthetic thread to tie the plot (and history) together."
1,Foucault's Pendulum: Swallowing the whole Christmas pudding,"The thing about this book is in the beginning it does attract the reader to the subject but then Eco treats the same thing over and over again. We know Signor Eco is a brilliant and academic homme but he fails to realise that the verbosity in his novel by showing off all the occults he knows renders his book to be rather plotless. In that sense the book loses life. It is eating the whole Christmas cake. Signor Eco overdosed, as if drugged by his brilliance. Academic readers will find this rather disappointing in that sense. Interesting but disappointing in the ultimate sense. This will be intriguing for younger readers as they can look up the net and search for the place names and histories he mentions but little in plot enhancement. Eco forced us to eat the whole Christmas pudding rather than living room for other desserts."
1,Pompous Trash,"Eco obviously did some research for this book. Unfortantely for the reader, he tried to cram it all into this long-winded boring mess without bothering to condense the information. Eco has no concept of how to write a good story. I do find it impressive that so many people could get through this awful pompous monstrosity."
1,Not worth the time,"The characters are flat, the setting changes can be confusing and it's an overall waste of time. I love conspiracy theory and secret societies and this is just a disappointment after all the hype and glowing reviews."
2,before the Da vinci code there was Foucault's Pendulum,"I don't like the slimy hero or his publishing house friends.The lunacy that goes on in this book seems like the late Egyptian empire descent into insane magic. That the book inspired a later American best seller doesn't make it right for me.I had a very hard time reading this bookas it is slow and full of a half way history of satanic beastality and secret societies in Europe.Since the main character also does a book on metaland the science and technology involved,he isn't an ignorant fellow.That he throws all logic and credibility out, just makes mewonder at the irrationality involved?"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Conspiracies shouldn't be boring.Unfortunately, in the case of this overlong mess, they most definitely are.Or, in other words, he has thrown everything but the kitchen sink in (and it is possible to have missed the references to those, as they may have been in ancient Babylonian somewhere in the text, perhaps.) One big wodge of lies, conspiracy and stuff."
4,Very fun read,"Many say it's difficult, perhaps I had a better time havaing read Pynchon's "" The Crying of Lot 49"" ( a short book ) and "" Holy Blood, Holy Grail "". The end shone with an amber light reminding of the defeat of Crassus in Plutarch or the dismall end of ""Brave New World. A little "" Ape And Essence"" too, glory to belial in the lowest, which in turn reminds of ""Lord of the Flies""..."
2,Unsatisfying,This book was recommended to me by someone who thinks that it teaches new insights in human psychology-philosophy. Well this is not the impression I got from this book.
3,Hard Work,"I was hooked in the beginning, but then I was bogged down in what a previous reviewer aptly described as ""the big lump of detailed nonsense in the middle"". However, I persevered to the end, because I wanted to find out how all of this misinformation would be interpreted. Eco did manage to pull it all together, and I was rewarded with a satisfying ending, and a strong sense of accomplishment for having made the trip.I believe that there was a great story embedded in this mess. But Eco's detailed descriptions of minor historical events were just a chore to read. He included references to places, people and events that had no relation to the basic plot of the book.A stricter editor was definitely needed."
2,Turgid,"I was disappointed in reading this highly touted work. I expected more than the rambling plotless work I encountered. I may have melodramatic tastes, but I found this novel to have too little forward momentum, and too many eddies and backwaters of trivial arcanae.And these backwaters are not exactly limpid pools, but often just stagnant water. There is an interesting premise-a group of people at a publishers act as ""agents provocateurs"" in order to bring occult groups out of the woodwork. They succeed to some extent, but what they uncover was hardly worth the trouble. A more interesting idea might have been to have them bring to light something truly diabolical (we're talking fiction, right?).I would rank this on a par with ""The Da Vinci Code""-but for quite other reasons."
3,Incredible amount of data,"Secret societies, Templars, mysteries and myths are part of this book that contains so much information that you will feel overwhelmed by it. Sometimes a novel, sometimes an essay, the story is about 3 friends who discover a plan, a ""master plan"", and get trapped by it. More than 500 pages of historical data that surely inspired Dan Brown's hits (Da Vinci's code and Angel & Demons) often make you feel lost in the plot. Read it with patience."
4,"Read it after reading Holy Blood, Holy Grail","Yes, read this book after reading Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Baigent, et al. and it will make much more sense. I think what Eco did here was a parody on how the authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail went about writing their book. Eco also bombards the reader with many confusing and irrelevant information, just as Baigent did."
2,Painful,"I understand the history of this novel, and trudged through all gazillion pages hoping that at some point the Eco would pull me in; unfortunately, he didn't. Yes, you can perceive his spewing of words as a challenge to what you normally think about his world, or you may read it as just ramblings to get paid by the page. I can't come close to recommending this, even though I know many of my friends enjoyed it. Don't waste your time."
2,Let's be Honest!,"Just because a book is interlaced with a vast bank of intellectual data does NOT necessarily qualify it as a great read. To compare this book with Ulysses and War & Peace is a crime; those books were exceptionally well written. I personally believe that many readers praise this book simply to qualify themselves as `advanced' intellectuals. Big deal! I have read the book and found it endowed with much knowledge but that did not make it a good read. Look at the other reviews and you'll find one reoccurring theme, ""Patchy"", ""Choppy"" etc..; I could not agree more. Let's face it people the Oxford English Dictionary is a complex, intellectually challenging publication, that does not mean I want to read it from cover to cover. If it's bragging rights you're looking for then read ""Foucault's Pendulum."" If its fine, eloquent writing you seek, save yourself the money!"
2,"OK, Mr Eco, you stumped me","I bought this book because it sounded like an interesting challenge and a great story. I love historical fiction and the mixture of history, religion and computers sounded great. The problem is that Eco got lost in arcane inuendo and analogies that I'm certain he knew the great majority of his readers would have no clue how to interpret. Whole sentences in multiple languages and names made me laugh out loud at how impossible this book can be. I found myself skimming through sections of minutiae just to get back to the story.I gave it 2 stars for the storyline and Eco's impressive writing ability. But, unfortunately, the story gets lost in Eco's attempt to show his readers either how smart he is or that he has the Encyclopedia Brittanica open in front of him while he writes."
3,A slow tortuous book,"I am surprised that so few reviewers caught on that this book is a parody of occultist thought. The fact that Minnie Mouse plays a prominent role in THE PLAN, is a fairly obvious clue.The book is tortuous and slow which might be the reason people miss the parody. I sympathize with the readers that gave up mid stream. It is not for the weak of heart. Umberto Eco fills page after page with examples of the convoluted reasoning of occultists.I gave the book lower marks because parody wears thin when it is stretched too far.I could not heap enough praise on Eco's earlier novel, The Name of the Rose. I loved the concept of Foulcants Pendulum, but found the book longer and more confusing than the concept merited. I would not recommend it to the casual reader."
2,Eco is very pleased with himself!,"This is a fine 100-page novel. Unfortunately, it's trapped within the pages of a 500-page tome."
2,A Trying Read,Eco's obvious genius wore thin on this reader. I finished the book--but only because I refused to be beaten by its heavy-handed approach to miscellany. Hard to believe it's an international best seller!
5,"The greatest secrets are ""No secrets""","This is one of the best books I have ever read. For me, it submits the idea that the secret societies occults a very important secret: that they do not have any real secret! I really enjoyed the mistery, the templar history and the thread of the novel. Since I read this book, I changed my passwords, and as Belbo, I named my computer ""Abulafia""."
2,huh???,"I think you have to be either an historian or a self absorbed pseudo-intellectual to fully enjoy this novel. I almost never fail to complete a novel once I start, but this was so painful to read and absorb that I just had to put it down. That being said, I have to admit that now I feel challenged, and will probably give this book a second chance someday."
3,How did this become a bestseller?,"The topic is fascinating, the book is tedious. Endless description, with sometimes whole paragraphs detailing minutiae. There are some paragraphs that are nothing more than lists. There is description about the origins of the Templars, and their Plan, but this too often dissolves into a scholarly dissertation rather than a novel. A better author could have culled two hundred pages off of this book and made it much more interesting. It took about a hundred pages for him to set the hook, and then he didn't really return to it until 200 pages later. Was he getting paid by the page? It would seem so. It is an interesting story, but not worth the time and energy to invest for five hundred pages. Read the reviews instead."
2,Frequent errors in Kindle edition,"This review is for the Kindle edition.I loved reading this book the first time and when I got a kindle I thought it would be a great book to inaugurate my new e-reader. Unfortunately, it seems that whoever scanned in the book never proof-read the result. While it is readable, I'm sure any publisher (even Manutius, hah!) would be scandalized publishing a book with so many typos."
2,"Wasn't good 15 years ago, and hasn't aged gracefully","Eco would surely make a poor poker player--the poor guy can't hide his emotions and feelings, especially as it relates to alternative interpretations of Religion. As this book plods along, the reader gets a really good sense that Eco has some unbridled disgust for anti-establishment. Well, it shows, as by the end of the book, he is literally mocking these anti-establishment folks.I was hoping to not have to sift through Eco's pretentious word choices and sentence structure. Thankfully I did not. Instead, I was visited with ""name drop blitzkreig"". In other words, Eco just threw one name, group, ancient location, etc. after another. Was it to impress? I have no idea, but most of it didn't move the plot forward.Eco at least had a good subject matter for his plot, I can give him that much. The way to get to the conclusion, however, was muddled with a lot of nonesense and unnecessary verbage."
1,It's a hotchpotch of obscure texts,"Umberto Ecco presents a mystery thriller which his publishing house describes as ""endlessly diverting"".Well, it is - and even more.Agreeing with the statement of one of the protagonist on page 433:>Stop, enough is enough, I'm sick<Mr. Ecco does his best in dragging along all kind of stories about Templars, Rosicrusians, Jesuits, Cathars, Renaissance philosophers, the Grail, the Nazis and all kind of Diabolicals.The story itself would be an interesting plot: Three editors invent a story to disguise the well kept secret of a mystery society. And tough luck: there are people out there who not only believe the plot but are moreover convinced that they have been part of it for ages and are ready to murder for it.Unfortunately Mr. Ecco gets caught in the swirl of his own ideas and delusions and makes it for the reader very difficult to follow."
2,'the book to read' not long ago,"This is an intellectual 'davinci code' type book, historical religious fiction, very pretentious, not as readable.Some suggest Eco intentionally made his books boring at the start, to discourage thosee not intellectually ardent enough to plow forward. Ok maybe, but what about the middle and end of this one?Read The Name of the Rose before even thinking about this.Foucault is less accessible and less interesting than Name of the Rose- a classic, but 10 times the complication if that doesnt seal the deal for you."
2,"oh, please let it end","I felt like I was reading this book for a class test rather than for pleasure. I found myself lost in the details, and wondering...what is the point?!? The concept of the book was fascinating, which drew me to pick it up, but the execution was oh, so boring. I can't give this book a completely negative rating. When Umberto Eco wrote somewhat normally -- with a plot and characters, for instance, rather than page after page of mind numbing, pointless details -- I actually enjoyed the book and storyline. Although I found his references to ""the Thing"" revolting. I'm offended when people refer to a baby as ""it""...but the Thing is revolting. It turned me against the protagonist...was that Eco's purpose? Can anyone recommend another of his books? I enjoyed the Name of the Rose but was put off by this endeavor (or is that not obvious?)."
4,Mindbending,"This book was recommended to me by a good friend, a young man with a masters' degree in Mod. Eur. History with a fantastic background in philosophy and economics. Half the read I could not stop laughing, the other half I had to go back again and make certain what the hell I was reading. Though I enjoyed the intertwining conspiracy theories and the characters, Eco kind of left me in a lurch at the end; no different than the feeling I had after reading ""For Whom The Bell Tolls."" Worth a second even read during a lazy summer vacation."
3,Interesting,"The book was really well written. One would be hard pressed,IMO, to guess it was a translation from Italian, it was that well written.Toward the end, though, without spoiling the book, Eco describes some fantastic things the main characterwitnesses, then blasely dismisses his own first-hand account. Maybe, I am missing something. I do love the ending, independent of this discrepancy. The ending had a sweet beauty and poetry to it."
1,I give up,"I made it through about 450 pages of this thing until I realized that having only one life to live, and having a limited amount of reading time available in that alloted life span, I didn't want to waste anymore of it on this book which, as far as I can tell, never goes anywhere. It consists of incessant litanies of apparent connections between historical events, people, secret societies, etc. which, after hundreds of pages, left me (a) not caring, and (b) finally deciding that this pathological list-making was going nowhere and taking forever to get there. This book is an immense waste of time."
2,Cacophony of Ideas,"I was very dissastisfied after reading this book. With so much conjecture, tension, and intrigue, I expected a more interesting conclusion. As a matter of fact, I knew exactly how it was going to end, and prayed throughout the last third of the book that I would be wrong. Only recommened if you are a serious history nut and would enjoy readng endless speculation about the movements and trials of an unverifiable, if not imaginary, group of people who control some vague tool powerful enough to .... what, exactly?Perhaps UE meant to elicit the frustration of his homeland's bureaucracy. A country which I am infinitely fond of, for the record."
1,Not worth the effort,"If you enjoy slogging through pedantic trivia, this is the book for you. Every time I thought I was (finally!!) geting into the story, we would go off on another 75 pages or so of uninteresting drivel. I quit after 400 pages because life is just too short to waste on a book like this."
1,Too many side tracks,"I read this book several years ago. This was an awful book; not on a conceptual basis, but on a ""let me try and explain it to you in 25 words or less"". Where was the editor? Certainly you could not stand in front of a classroom and try and explain it the way the author does or, as the translator. My advice is just skip it. There are many other books out there that delve into the same type of secret society schtick."
1,Not Able To Finish,"For those of you who will tell me not to review a book if I have not finished it, I disagree. Just like a bad movie, where one leaves half way through a movie, a book not enjoyed can be stopped and reviewed. I read about 300 pages of this book and only felt confused and lost. It was disjointed, rambling and without focus. There were occasional interesting scenes and sections, but I never developed a passion for the book, its subject, or any of the characters. I think he should have written two books, one novel and another on the history of cults. I enjoyed his The Name of The Rose and I am also looking forward to reading Prague Cemetery, but this one, I would skip."
3,3 months later...,It took me a while to get through this. The book is densely written and goes in more directions than a spider's web. The breadth of topics is impressive even though most of the depth is manufactured. The last 150 pages I just wanted it to end...for there to be some resolution to the seemingly endless diversions on almost every subject. Instead there is only something about truth or beauty or something else that really doesn't bring the book to a close. But most of the book is entertaining. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.
4,"What the heck is the joke about ABULAFIA, anyway?","Umberto Eco struck paydirt in America with the publication and subsequent filming of ""The Name of the Rose"", but ""Pendulum will do little, I'm afraid, to enhance his reputation here. ""Pendulum"" is much too dense, much too intellectual for the average American reader. ""Pendulum"" is a brilliant story -- the last 100 pages terrified me, and snapped me out of the doldrums he had created the previous 250 pages. Now, go out and get ""The Island of the Day Before"" for a serious shipwreck story"
3,intelligent but sloppy,"I thought there were some amusing and some challenging parts but the construction seemed sloppy as if Eco himself became a little reckless and bored with it midway. A subject that dense and layered needs to be approached with more precision but I admire the scope and the ambition.I read it on a very turbulent flight over the Atlantic ocean and had the strange thought that if this plane were to crash, this is definitely not a book I'd like to be my last."
4,Amazing what Eco inspires others to write...,I am once again amazed at how intelligent people sound after reading a well written book. I'm not going to spout any big words pretending to be some quasi-literary scholar. Its a good book. Read it. You'll like it.
4,Pedant's Dream,"A fascinating story with endless intellectual detours that leaves you wishing you'd taken more liberal arts in college. The tangential anecdotes of history, philosophy and religion touch upon the entire scope of western and mystical ideas. Not a good read for someone who needs to grasp every facet of what they read-- there's just too much intellectual breadth there"
2,Slow moving and tedious,"Although I was impressed by the author's intellect and encyclopedic knowledge of diverse topics, the characters and narrative were less than engrossing. The storyline progressed at a snail's pace as I kept waiting for an interesting plotline to develop. Although I learned more than I ever wanted to know about the Knights Templar, I find most history text books more engrossing."
1,Pretentious and extremely boring,The main purpose of this book is to promote the author's phylosophical ideas. He tries to show his erudition. But his Hebrew is poor (I live in Israel) and in one case he makes a mistake with numbers. What remains? The idea that the a conspiracy theory may be self-fulfilling? Endless attempts to find a sense in a random series of historical events? The author's desire to get Nobel Prize?
3,Horn of Too Much Plenty,"Oh, Eco, player of the Horn of Plenty... You human cornucopia, Homunculus Nebula, composer of the sounds of Amalthea! You concocter of this litarary Cratellus, this Black Cantarel of a book. Couldn't you have used a few fewer words to get the message through? This is a Horn of Much Too Much Plenty."
4,Mixed review,"I found the book to be an entertaining read and think the author wrote a good story. Though some of the scenarios with computer outages were a little farfetched and hard to swallow, the adventure in the story covered for it. I did notice some editing problems myself, but that didn't affect the story much. I'm sure the editors heard a mouth full already. With each book Pineiro writes he gets better. I look forward to his next.Recomended...for the thrills"
2,Do yourself a big favor...,"This book will be a genuine waste of time for a reader that is well educated, it is insulting to our intellegence that works of this nature are published. Simple gramatical errors are acceptable for a high school book report... not a piece of literature. The concept seemed interesting enough, to pick it up. I feel that it is my civic duty to inform you, the reader, that this is a read you can pass up."
1,Don't bother,"I have never seen so many grammatical and punctuation errors in any book by any author. Additionally, there are a number of subtle and not-so-subtle errors in the story. For instance, in the beginning of chapter 44, the action is taking place on a submarine. In the second paragraph the main character is copying data to a Zip drive. In the very next paragraph, there are ""no Zip drives aboard the [submarine]"". (I think the author must be getting kickbacks from Iomega judging from the number of times he mentions Zip drives). The very premise of the book is rather contrived. All in all, a very poorly written and edited book."
3,a splendid summertime read for American history lovers,"I bought this book on a whim while on vacation this summer. The author does a fine job of bringing turn of the century American history to life. That is,larger than life swashbuckeling American history. The pace and events are sort of on the lines of Indiana Jones. Our hero manages to escape certain death throughout the book, sometimes improbably, but always entertainingly. This is a swashbuckeler with a sence of humor as well. And you might learn a bit of history along the way."
3,"Loud, sloppy, and brutal","The antithesis of his brilliant album, ""So Alone."" Here Johnny's in a club setting, trying to run through what would essentially be a soundtrack to Lech Kowalski's film featuring Thunders himself as a drug addict (the liner notes admit that Johnny ""disappeared"" for three days after getting paid). There are two sets here, late and very late, and just when you think Johnny can't get more out of control, he turns the whole mess up to 10. If you're a Thunders fan it's the ultimate document of Johnny's disintegration. Rates a third star for the sheer chutzpah of the entire project."
2,Not very instructive,"All the sample essays are great. But their structures, I think, are elusive. The essayists are too professional to choose a college-style method of writing and I had a very difficult time figuring out the elements of those essays. They scatter randomly in the articles and contradict what Alfred Rosa and Paul Eschholz teach us.Read it through and you'll be overwhelmed with lots of flowery prose. It is a valuable reference resource, but not a GUIDE."
3,Good book,"I only used this book for several weeks before I tested out of the class. What little I saw, it was a good book."
2,Trendy format spoils scholarship.,"In my mind, the words ""scholarship"" and ""color print"" don't mix. For centuries scholars have found their way through page after page of black and white (perhaps dark brown and light brown from time to time), and it seems odd that suddenly we have happened upon a better way - black and BLUE and white.That's cool for a travel dictionary you're trying to read in a taxi, or when pointing out some turn-of-phrase to a fellow tourist. It's flashy and stylish. And as long as you don't have to look at it for more than, say, twenty seconds at a time, I suppose it would do.But to me the name ""Oxford"" means ""if you're serious, this is for you."" The name ""Duden"" is likewise highly esteemed.So why is a dictionary made for the studious person being marketed to the tourist? I'm sure the scholarship is excellent, but I really wish it were in black and white. If there were a comparable edition in the traditional format I would buy it right away."
4,British English - German Dictionary,"Excellent English - German dictionary if you use British English. I would not have bought it if it had been advertised on Amazon as featuring British English, not American. The name ""Oxford"" should have been a clue to me. Too bad...."
4,beware : all entries are written with BLUE INK!!!,"This dictionary is fine and complete (not as complete though as the Langenscheidt Encyclopaedic Muret-Sanders, which comes in for volumes!). The only major, major problem I see is the blue ink used for entries, which makes it quite annoying and difficult to read. This might be interesting for children (who usually like books with colors...), but it is totally unnecessary otherwise. This is all the more unfortunate since it seems that the Collins (another fine English-German dictionary) is also using the same damned blue ink. Please, please let's keep it black!"
3,disappointed/ don't like blue words : harder to read than the black. Paper quality poor,poor quality paper gives tha feel that the pages will easily tear and the dictionary is not built to last. The words are highlighted in blue rather than the usual darker black and this makes it more difficult to sort them out.The book seems to be more designed for its prettiness than for its functionality.word spacing could be better.
5,La Petite Bebe - Fleece Blanket,"Lovely ~ ~ it's a little pricey compared to similar items that can be found in the store, but if -- as I was -- you're looking to match the nursery theme by buying within the La Petite Bebe line, you won't be disappointed by the quality of this blanket. High quality, great workmanship -- all you need is the baby to go in it!"
2,A little overmarked maybe?,"In what world does a 2-pack of Hanes knee-highs go for $40 at full retail? I mean, I see no problem with marking up the retail a little to make it look like stuff here on Amazon is on sale, but geez. I'll just go to Target where I know I can get the exact same thing for the ""sale"" price at all times."
2,Product does not match description,The advertised description and my receipt clearly state that this is supposed to be a Pack of 6. There are two pair in the box. Next time I'll go to Penney's or Wal Mart and get what I pay for.
5,Comfy!,I love these. They make all of my shoes feel more comfortable. They don't slide down and have a good amount of stretch and are the perfect amounts of sheer.
2,Disappointing,"As a TREMENDOUS fan of Steele's ""Space"" series (Clarke County, Space; Lunar Descent; Orbital Decay), I had hoped for another wonderful, charmingly human yet extremely hard-science near-future sf read. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in all respects by this one. The aliens are remote and uninteresting, the characters are hollow (and this in a STEELE book?!), and the plot is insipid. If I had to make a comparison, this was a lot more reminiscent of Michael Crichton's truly bad efforts (""Sphere,"" for instance) than any of Steele's prior work"
2,Not very good science fiction,"This seemed to have great promise; the face, pyramids, exploration but it all fell apart shortly into the story and turned into the typical government intervention and conspiracy book, with Mars as the minor story line...disappointing."
2,meh...,"This started out well, but after about 100 pages, Mr. Steele threw out most of the interesting characters and potential plotlines and turned this into a rather boring and predictable drama - supposedly taking part on Mars, but it could have been anywhere. Glad I bought this used."
2,Not a very good book,The plot was not very interesting. The aliens even less interesting. The ending was a disappointment.
2,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for","I purchased 7 of these stop watches for an experiment, and selected them because they are the cheapest we could find.It keeps track of the time, date, has an alarm, hourly chime and of course the stop watch. The lap function on the stop watch works as you would expect.The user interface is poor, changing the time turns the alarm on. There is no indication the hourly chime is on, and to turn it of you push lap/reset and mode together. Easy if you know it hard, if you don't.The durability is poor. I left one stop watch in my car in the parking lot for a day. The sticker describing the functions peeled off. Worse, the LCD is now only partly visible, and the parts that are visible change. Three days later it is still unusable. To be fair, I left it in the sun on a 75 degree day, but it's disappoint that I am already down one stop watch.If you want a really cheap stop watch, this will work, but don't expect it to last and don't leave it out in the sun."
2,Just ok,"I was just looking for a really basic stop watch, but this has an alarm option and a couple of other things. I really didn't want all of that. Now the thing beeps every few hours and I can't figure out how to shut it off. It's not what I was looking for."
4,it's worth the money,The stopwatch is great! The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it didn't let you/me pick what color the stopwatch came in. It is very easy to use and it tells you the date and what time it is. It also tells you when the alarm is set to.
3,Ok stuff,"I bought 12 of those and although they were brand new, 2 of them needed new batteries right away. The bateries are more expensive than the stopwatch... Overall it is an OK, very basic stopwatch."
5,"Adm Paxton, again","This is basically the same X-wing that they issued in '95 and is similar to the original release. Very good all around and worth collecting. Fun, durable, and needing only a pilot figure. I intend to collect more in the near future."
3,Cheap,"This wallet does the job, OK, but dont expect a high quality wallet, cheap materials, and cheap built. I have seen much higher quality wallets in the market."
1,Terrible!,This clock is terrible...time is fast...1/2 an hour per week...terrible. I would never recommend this product to anyone...just a wast of money!
3,should have left this underwater,"to be honest this is a single, not the best but i recommend this for a p collector who just has to have every bit a p-funk out there, george should have sampled aqua boogie, or rumpofsteelskin, oh yeah the story about shine is on the old rudy ray moore albums, so blah"
4,good product,"Came quickly, product was as described and for fairly cheap. Was able to install this particular part within 15 minutes. Very pleased!"
1,Pass the rib eye and the slayer,"This band is bad , I like cows too, just grilled and served will choice of soup and a side potato and slather some A1 sauce over it."
5,One of my favorite bands,"Cattle Decapitation seems to be one of those bands that you either love or hate. I haven't heard all of their earlier material so I can't comment on that but I really love this album as well as Humanure. I can't really pick between the two on which one is the better album since I prefer some songs off of this one and some off of Humanure. Sure some of the songs sound similar but if your into death metal/grindcore then you know that this isn't a problem. To Serve Man is probably my favorite track by them although there are other standout tracks as well. As always, Travis Ryan does an excellent job with the vocals and the production is well done overall. If your a fan of Cattle Decapitation and have yet to pick up this album, you won't be disappointed."
3,Tries to hard to be Impaled,"I like this record, don't get me wrong, but they need to find there own sound. This is just a mediocre attempt at a gore metal masterpiece. ..."
2,Huh? ... No.,"Cattle Decapitation. Think Carcass, Exhumed, and Cannibal Corpse all smashed together with 200% more vegan hypocrisy. Oh, and sans any of the originality or character of the said bands. Aren't self-righteous vegetarians supposed to make -good- grindcore? Just look at Napalm Death and Nasum. Oh well... Cattle Decapitation is brimming with cut & paste riffing lacking cohesion and flow. They're one of those bands that release albums for another excuse to tour, basically. On the plus side, Travis' vocals are really sick, (He sounds like... Exploding bowels? I tried.) but this is just more uninspired death/grind to stand on the sidelines.- Thus says the Pellington"
5,ABSOLUTELY HYSTERICAL!,"I'm a fan of mock death metal bands, and let me tell you, I was rolling around on the floor laughing my butt off for the entire duration of this CD. Can't understand a single word of the straight-from-the-depths-of-Hell vocal style, and the drums and just blasting away from the first second to the last. Funny stuff. I haven't laughed this much since the Hate Eternal album. This is right up there with the funniest death metal releases of the year. Buy it now!"
4,The Next Cannibal Corspe is This............,"wow, that was all i could say. travis, the vocalist, he is a death metal god. and dont even get me started on the guitar lines. however, i slightly feel that this cd lacks catchiness, but that is not what death metal is about, but then again, i take that back, i am not sure. this album was very good, i just feel like they lacked something in it....i cant quite put my finger on it. but then i sorta take that back as well. i think this band will come around and be one of the greatest death metal bands of all time. i have extreamly mixed feelings on this. i really liked it over all. i recomend it to all cannibal corpse fans. i dont know why they remind me of cannibal corpse so much.\m/(>_<)\m/metal til im 60"
1,Junk Made in China,"Ordered three of these batteries. Two of the three were found to be defective. They were a bit too short and did not fit snuggly in the battery compartment of the phone. Consequently, they could not make contact with the phone terminals. Returned the two defective batteries to Amazon and they sent out 3 replacements (even though I had returned only two). All three of the replacement batteries were also defective. They do not make contact with the terminals. Does not surprise me since the batteries are made in China. Would not even considering ordering these again."
2,Charging Power doesn't last long,"Fit my phones great, but the charging power sure didn't last long. They were dead within 6 months. Will not be purchasing again."
2,Does not fit AT&T handset,I did a lot of research to make sure that this battery would fit my AT&T TL76008 handset but it does not. Lenmar's website and the battery packaging both state that this is a replacement for the original AT&T battery (89-1324-00-00). The problem is the Lenmar battery is just a few millimeters shorter than the original which allows the battery to slide inside the phone and lose connection. I was able to cut a small piece of cardboard to slide under the bottom of the battery to take up the extra space which is working fine so far but I'm dissappointed that I've had to make this modification.
3,A little disappointed,I received my ring and was a little disappointed that the ring is not completely blue (like the picture shows). It looks like I got a blue flower with green leaves. So it makes the ring look blue and green. Very small ring. Not worth $6.99 but more like $3.
1,disappointed!,"Product never gave size, (Length or Width) and there was nowhere to place a message for the receiver of the product."
5,A must have!,I received a pink and yellow set as a gift and have been thankful ever since. From the beginning I used these items on my 7lb 30z newborn girl. The material is so very baby soft. I look forward to tummy time so that I may cuddle along with my baby under the large sized receiving blanket. The pieces last through several washings and remain adorable. You will use every single piece included in this set.
3,Works great,"Bought this for my boyfriend for a suprise gift, and it works great. the range is quite far, haven't hadany problems yet.*new update**after having thisd for a few months i've come to notice that the signal is good, but it had phantom buttons. ex being you wont even have the controller in hand and buttons are being pushed on screen even after putting in brand new batteries and resyncing it. It still works alright but not as happy with it as i thought."
5,The best humor book around!,I haven't read Fox Trot until my friend got me hooked on it. I enjoy reading it every day in the paper and I love it when new books come out! I can sit and read them over and over and laugh just as hard as I did the first time. I only hope I will continue to see more Fox Trot around!
1,The story of a poor man,"Un nuevo libro acerca de un individuo que no hizo nada, pero que tenia el aspecto que Hollywood aplaude. Lo lamento por el, pues posiblemente eram bientencionado. Dejen que los gringos lo compren......"
4,A Great Book about a Complex President,"This book is very informative and well written. It uncovers our intelligent, adulterous, articulate, dishonest President Bill Clinton. I would recommend this book to my friends."
5,"Fair minded, respectfully strips the presidential mystiqe","David Maraniss captured between the covers of this biography the complex personality of a man and the times he grew up in. We may not agree with how Bill Clinton avoided the draft, but when it's put into the context of the ""60s"" we find that he didn't really do anything worse then millions of others. He just wanted to complete his education. How he handled the ""draft question"" is another story. His personnal life is discused frankly without muckraking. It shows what it takes to become ""presidential"" in our sociaty today. If this is good or bad is left up to the reader. I enjoyed this book and now have a respect and understanding of the subject both as a person and President."
4,Fascinating and fair,"This book is exhaustively researched and unbiased. Don't let some of these reviews fool you -- Mariness has no pro- or anti-Clinton agenda. Whether you loathe him or love him, you will leave this book with a greater understanding of why he has done what he's done, and you'll be amazed at how often patterns repeat themselves in his life."
3,"Nice, just not as strong as their other 90's albums","I assumed that this being, from what I can tell, their earliest material, that it would rock hardest. It's that they hadn't yet found their writing strength yet. They have their dual guitars but the songs are as musically flowing like their next 5 albums. This is still indie rock but, a dash of punk, a smelt of Neil Young sounding guitar but no songs that are memorable like the many on the next 5 albums. I've been listening to rock n roll since about 1967. Typically I find that a group's first album is often their best. Course, this isn't a proper album but a collection of singles and eps. This album is in my group of 6th to 10th favorite albums of theirs. That is, I don't listen to it much while I listen to the first 5 pretty regularly. chrisbct@hotmail.com"
3,just 4 reviews?!?,"the best thing about this record is the passion it holds. like 'em or not, superchunk has always been passionate. and if you fault the music--especially during recent years--for being predictable and samey, you can't fault the members of the band; they run one of the greatest record labels in all the land, merge, which has released more than a few of my favorite albums (among them the magnetic fields' _69 love songs_, spoon's _girls can tell_, neutral milk hotel's _in the aeroplane over the sea_, and the clean _anthology_). this disc is full of pretty standard early 90s indie guitar rock. but like i said, it's the ecstatic presentation that makes it special. all the same, i prefer the variation that the teenage fanclub comp offers."
4,"Wedemeyer Reports, a political general","I wonder if there is any connection from Animal House, where the A** Hole ROTC commander with the white horse is named Douglas C. Nedemeyer, which seems pretty close to Albert C. Wedemeyer.... Since this book is written by Al Wedemeyer, we'll probably never know.Wedemeyer spent the first years of the war working for Marshall, planning the invasion of Europe. When Chiang, Mountbatten, and Roosevelt finally decided to dump Stillwell, Wedemeyer got one of his jobs. Wedemeyer became Chiang's chief of staff. Wedemeyer was convinced that the Chicoms weren't going to be a good thing for China, but was unable to convince Truman of that before we had helped them into power. We also kind of screwed up Vietnam about then. We did do the right thing in Greece though. Wedemeyer was more of a politician than Stillwell (read his book too). Actually, I don't own this book, I borrowed it from the library. If I bought every book I read, I'd have your warehouse."
3,Good Information but out of my range,"Personally, I thought the book was rather good. Some of the ideas this book provides are so simple and effective that you are amazed that you never thought of it before. The person who wrote it clearly has much experience in living in the woods with nothing, though. I didn't find many of the explanations to complete or clear enough. In addition, I live in Connecticut. The author really focuses on surviving in the desert and similar areas. This would make sense, as he was born in the Southwest, but for people like myself, this applies very little to the completely different woodland terrain."
2,"Not a ""survive until rescued"" book","This book is meant for the survival enthusiest. I.e. someone who likes to go out and intentionally spend weeks at a time living off the land. For them, this is a good book.It is NOT useful for hikers/backpackers/boaters etc. who are worried that if they get lost or stuck they need survival skills to last until rescued.It has a information on topics such as building a bow and arrow, setting trap lines of 100-200 traps, making stone tools, and tanning hide (all things that require considerable time, energy, and practice). What it does not have is any information on getting rescued - not even a mention of what makes a good distress signal.I haven't read many survival books, but if you're looking for a ""survive until rescued"" book check out The Complete Book of Outdoor Survival by J. Wayne Fears."
2,Not useful,I don't understand why this book gets such high praise. It is not a how to book but more of a show and tell. If you want to learn survival skills look elsewhere. I bought this book thinking I was going to learn something. It just shows you what a shelter is and what this is or that.
1,No skills taught here,"If you want to read a story about how the author thinks he can survive in the wild, this is the book for you. I bought this book many years ago and found it useless at the time. I recently got it out again and thought I would give it another try. Same thing- almost useless. The author talks about a lot of things that would probably be very good to know/learn but the trouble is that most of the things are not explained enough for a regular person to be able to figure out how to actually do them. Your money would be better spent on a real survival book and not this one."
3,ShortChanged,The book seems to be very good but when I opened the front cover it starts out with Page 31. In other words I was cheated out of the first part up to page 31.
4,It helps,"Basically, I've been trying to read books these past two weeks that can help me understand what makes us so willing to kill others. I'm referring, of course, to what happened on September 11th, but also to mankind's history of war and murder and cruelty. Godlust goes a long way explaining why we do the things we do. Even better, it offers strategies for breaking out of the cycle of violence."
1,what he said !!!,Run away....very far away.I bought it used in the hope that one or two tracks might be worth it....WRONG!Buyer beware when shopping Sweet compilation cd's although Teenage Rampage on Castle and Blockbuster Alternative Takes on Cleopatra might suit your needs if the price is right.
2,Tambourine,Cheaper model than the one I wanted. I gave it away....I want one of these but more solid. Cute one for kids....
4,"Great kit, great instructions!","I gave it a star off b/c the center of the case is cardboard. Cardboard? Can't even use cheap plastic? Come on. Otherwise, it's a good kit."
3,Needs Penance to Go Along With It....,"If you would like to know my take on ""True Confessions,"" please continue reading. If you consider comments to be ""spoilers,"" please stop reading right now....In John Gregory Dunne's ""True Confessions,"" Hitchcock'sI Confessseems to have been masterfully interwoven with the story of theso-called ""Black Dahlia"" murder case. Yet, ""True Confessions"" is NOT the spiritual masterpiece that is ""I Confess"" NOR the sensational crime drama of the real life ""Black Dahlia"" case. And like just about all Hollywood fare, ""True Confessions"" chooses to be exploitative when its audience could have easily gathered what was happening.While ""True Confessions"" does have a tremendous theme of finding everything when seemingly losing everything, some dopey messages can also be detected. For example,* priests who are obedient to Church authority = bad;* priests who buck the system = good."
1,True confessions,Could not watch on my DVD . Said I could play in my area...please remove from DVD player..Very disappointed ...waste of money. Will not reorder...would like to return for refund....And exchange for one thatPlays in the USA
4,"The first ""Black Dahlia""","When I first saw this movie,I was haunted by the beautiful Irish music in the background. Two brothers,DeNiro the up and coming priest and Duvall his detective brother are caught up in a murder,reminiscent of the ""Black Dahlia"" murder of the late 40's. In a gripping tale of post-WW II Los Angeles,we follow the careers of both brothers as they become embroiled in corruption of church and power.It is fascinating and gritty.Charles Durning turns in a great role as well as Burgess Meredith.Especially creepy,is the discovery of the murder scene. It left me with a feeling of regret of how power ultimately corrupts yet salvation can be achieved with time and understanding.Loved the book, loved the movie."
4,True Confessions - True Politics,An excellent movie with a tremendous cast. A Church Noir film that exposes the hypocracy of the spoken word and the actual actions of individuals in high places of authority. Recommend this film for a thoughtful evening.
2,MGM DVD TRANSFER,This is not a review of the film.Only the latest DVD from MGM which provides both a full screen version on one side and a widescreen version on the other.The widescreen version is not an anamorphic transfer which basically means it sucks.It looks like a compromised 1:66 or 1:71 to 1 transfer that has been stretched to fit a 1:85 to 1 widescreen TV frame. If you change your TV's aspect ratio to 14:9 it looks passable until the credits appear and then you'll notice the black bars (top and bottom)appear showing that your chosen aspect ratio is not right either! Up to then (the credits)the picture quality is only fair then when the credits appear and it gets tighter it looks very good but after the credits end so does the superior quality image on the 14:9 frame. Why on earth don't they just do one proper 1:85 to 1 ANAMORPHIC transfer on this terrific film and stop monkeying around with half ass letterbox and full frame crap?
4,Nice Replica Poster,"I'm a huge Salvador Dali fan, unfortunately I can't afford his real artwork now, so I'll have to settle for replicas until later! ;) I thought this was a good replica, the colors were decent and it's a nice size poster. It's large enough to capture attention but not so large that it looks gaudy. Dali's a surrealist artist, so I appreciate the simplicity this piece has, yet still keeping true to surrealism."
4,Live at the Sturgis Armory in the late 60's,"This seems to be one of the better Sturgis Armory tapes but it does not seem to equal the super high intensity of their monumental KICK OUT THE JAMS lp. The BLACK TO COMM CD is still an enjoyable show and captures what appears to be a pre-1st lp live concert. Various early songs such as Upper Egypt, Born Under a Bad Sign, and I Believe To My Soul are in this show. Also included is an early version of BLACK TO COMM which they were still using as a finale to their performances as late as their 1971 tour with Alice Cooper."
3,Helpful to some extent,"I'm in the process of reading this book. Some of the advice is very pedestrian (i.e. someone who gives you good service should be rewarded when possible.) And there is a little too much ettiquette-like advice along the same lines previously mentioned, and it's a little short on more of the quantitative explanations for me, but all in all, helpful, though keep in mind, this was written before the market exploded a decade ago."
4,Me thinks some reviewers protest too much,"This book has been damned for being too simplistic, therefore consign it to the trash cart, or so we are expected to do. But given the relative novelty of these financial products simplicity in the best sense of word could be seen as a virtue in any work dealing with this topic. So, why the evident annoyance from some. Could it be that this work dissolves some of the mystery involved, and threatens some closed shop in these markets ?"
5,Mysterious record taken in frost,"I first heard the song ""Temporaray loan"" (the first on the album) on a compilation. I found it wonderful: a song without many effects, a few chords, but an incredible atmosphere, absolutely mesmerizing. Infinite sadness, but quiet, without desperation. A few months later, I saw Edith Frost on stage in France, opening for the ""Dutch Harbour"" project (a silent documentary about fishing in Alaska, with a live soundtrack played by Edith's musicians). Beautiful gig. I bought the album which was really difficult to find. ""Temporary loan"" is maybe the best song, but all the others, including some happier ones, are great. I think Jim O'Rourke produced it. or maybe John McEntire. There are many Chicago post-rock musicians playing on it, and also Sean O'Hagan (High Llamas). They play just as they should, supporting lightly Edith's voice. If you like Cowboy Junkies, Tarnation, and all the new folk-country-indie scene, you will love this record."
1,Rabbits are not to have dairy!,"Rabbits are not to have any form of dairy, whether it be cheese, milk, yogurt, whey, casein, or anything else. Unfortunately, there are many companies out there that are only aiming to increase profits and have no knowledge about the animals they market their products for, and unsuspecting caregivers of the animals buy their products with good intentions, but end up harming their furbabies in one way or another. I've even found fish meal, yes, ground up fish, in treats for rabbits! Rabbits are herbivores! After being weaned, they survive and thrive on only plant matter.Take care of your bunnies and do not purchase any ""Yogies"" or other dairy treats for them, and ask others to do the same."
3,I like them but I wouldn't buy again,"These earrings are excellent if, like me, you adore babyphat as far as looks go, however, they are VERY heavy in your ear, if I wear them all day & into the eve my ears are terribly sore by the time I take them out. I love hoop & dangly earrings so I'm used to a little weight, but these are pretty bad. Just for an evening out or dinner or something, they're fine, but beware the length of time or suffer the consequences lol (I usually suffer :-D ). They're also fairly cheaply made (made in china kind of says it all) but if you have a look your going for, they will prob finish it off nicely."
4,"Honda CB400 and 500, 1973-77","Honda CB400 and 500, 1973-77 (Owners' Workshop Manual) (Purchased on 10/04/2011)by John WitcombThank you for providing availability of these types of books and manuals. Since this product is beyond the printing stage it is helpful to have a venue of out of print books to choose from."
3,Misses a lot,"Good on general procedure and specifications with several important reservations. If your bike is a 1976 or later model, this book does not cover the Keihin PD carbs at all. If your carburetors have the letters ""PD"" cast into the side of the housing, DO NOT follow this book's spec for float height or jet size and type. See the web forum SOHC4 (forums.sohc4.net) and query for Keihin PD carburetors. You'll find all the info you need there."
3,Nothing to write home about,Very heavy British accent. Hard to follow. Not too much more to be said about it. Color was good acting ok.
5,Mark of Cain,"Provoking. Two young British men-Mark and Shane- join the Iraq war. They grow familiar with the constant stress; they face, for the first time, the breaking points of mental and physical exhaustion. Nothing is safe here--every littered Coke can could be a cleverly disguised bomb. When their company captain is killed, a superior officer cracks, and orders the boys to begin torturing the locals. It is only until Mark and Shane have arrived safely back on UK shores that they are forced to confront the consequences of their actions.Thoughtful, relevant to contemporary times, beautifully filmed on a modest budget. It's little surprise the film won a BAFTA and the ""Movies That Matter"" Award at the Rotterdam International Film Festival."
2,Pretty disappointed,I was hoping for some familiar tunes I had heard at Zumba class that would add energy and remind me of Zumba but this CD doesn't Either I haven't been going to Zumba long enough or something because there are very few tunes I recognize on this CD. It does have a couple of familiar cuts so it is not all bad.
1,Disappointed,"It's not very upbeat poor sound quality,I don't recommend this product to anyone looking for an upbeat CD to workout too"
2,Vibe Tribe disappointment,Thought it was a zumba dance CD like others I bought before where I could learn more zumba steps.I don't like it because it was not the zumba CD thought.Not recommended unless you only want to hear the music rhythm.
1,zumba vibe tribe,was soooooo frustrated and ashame!...i gave this as a gift to friend just to find out there is no video!!.it's blank!....only music. !.....my friend Shiela will send it back to me.
3,Good for a beginner,"Ian covers most aspects of InterDev, along with COM, XML, and a few other related issues. It's a helpful read if you're new to InterDev, but if you've been using it awhile you won't come away with much information you'll be using in your work."
2,A Great Product explained,"Luckily, I read 'Visual Interdev in 24 Hours / Tom Archer/Sams' before I read Ian's book. The two books are as different as night and day.This jolly Brit has serious difficulties explaining concepts in a linear or 'Top Down' style. Instead you are always introduced to concepts at a very obscure detail level. You will never understand Visual Interdev nor will you get excited about this incredible product by reading this rough draft.Don't take my word for it. Read Ian's Acknowledgement/forward on the inside cover - it makes no sense. Unfortunately the entire book is written in this non-elegant and non-useful style.I am a Wrox fan at heart, but I returned this. The search to find something as good as the 'SAMS' book continues."
2,Pretty Poor,"I'm a big Wrox fan, owning at least $300 worth of their stuff. I was excited to see this title become available, but after a few hours with the text realized that this one is pretty bad. There's absolutely no context, order, background, or explanation to the topics. They're kind of just thrown out to you. (By the way, I'm an MCSD, so I'm not a programming neophyte). Most Wrox books assume you have a good technical background, lay a good foundation with clear explanations, and then become progressively deeper. This one just jumps right in.I was personally looking for volume that would give me a high to mid-level view of VID6. I believe the best one out there right now is the SAMS 24-hour book. Very approachable. If you need to get deeper, use BOL or Unleashed.On the positive side, the Wrox books for SQL7, ASP3, and ATL3 are excellent!"
5,"Great InterDev, ASP, COM Book!","A great book for experienced developers who need to know how to build effective and robust Web applications. Excellent coverage of the VI IDE, DTCs, debugging and COM component creation and deployment. As you'd expect from the Wrox Professional series it doesn't waste time trying to teach you basic programming and Web fundamentals. Highly recommended."
1,Waste of Time & Money,"Like the other reviews, the book skips around too much. Hard to follow. Even some of the example source code would not compile."
5,Great in-depth coverage!,"This book goes further than any other VI book I have read. It assumes an understanding of VI so it is definately not for beginners, but if like me you want to get the most out of the product then it's spot on. At last I understand how the Design Time Controls and the Scripting Object Model actually work and can make use of them in an effecient manner to build my applications quickly. Highly Recommended!"
1,Garbage,Do you really want to read a book from a guy who thinks his picture should be on the cover? That's all you need to know about this book. It useful only as kindling for a fire.
2,BE WARNED,"These deck boxes look quite impressive for the first two weeks you have them, then they fall apart.They are essentially made up of three main pieces then a base lining (made up of two smaller pieces), the adhesive for EVERY one of the pieces in BOTH of the boxes I purchased fell apart. And this is with a low amount of use!This is not just my experience, it happened to my friend's box as well, right in front of me!So be warned, if you purchase one of these boxes, you should also purchase some super-glue, and some patience."
5,Wow!,"I am currently in a Hebrew class, as I greatly desire to know the language of our Father. So, I felt that it was time to purchase a Tanach. While it would be wonderful if I had already mastered the Hebrew language, that is simply NOT true at this point in time! That being said, I needed not only the Hebrew text, but also the English translation. I definitely prefer this English translation over the King James version. Aesthetically, I'm one who prefers hard bound books. This Tanach is absolutely beautiful! Each and every time I open my Tanach is a true joy!"
5,A wonderful Tanach,I am very satisfied with this Tanach. I can recomend this edition of the Tanach. The service was exellent from Amazon.
3,True Transliteration?,"I like the fact that it has the Hebrew on the right side, but I have to wonder if the English is a true transliteration of the Hebrew, as they don't use any of the Hebrew names for people (except to use Hashem). For this reason, I like the Complete Jewish Bible (they use all Hebrew names for people, places, each book of the Bible, and peoples ""job"" titles). I am searching for truth and want to make sure that whatever version I'm reading is a true interpretation of the Hebrew. So, I'm not completely sold on this one (including the Chumash, which is produced by the same organization)."
5,A Classic,"While no translation is perfect, this collection does a fantastic job of bringing the 24 books to life. This is an excellent choice for your Jewish friend on his or her birthday."
3,Okay but lacks commentary,"This gorgeous volume is sadly lacking the rabbinical commentary for which reason I purchased it in the first place. Needless to say, I will be continuing my search for good commentary (Jewish rabbinical commentary) on the Bible. I was also shocked to find gold gilt-edging on the top and not the side and bottom pages; but I guess it is supposed to be this way? If you are just wanting a beautiful Jewish Bible, this one is that- beautiful. If you are looking for an accurate translation, you would do much better with a different translation. If you are looking for in-depth commentary, I must discourage you from this particular version since the commentary is very, very limited."
4,Print font is small,I like this however the font is small and the Hebrew is difficult to read in my opinion. I like the overall resource material included in the back but over all would like the size to be a little larger.
2,Unfortunately based on the Leningrad codex,"According to an Artscroll representative I contacted via email, the text is based on the Leningrad codex (L19), which is not as reliable as the Keter Aram Tzova or Aleppo codex.The translation is not to my liking: it twists the text. Makes you doubt things you believed before.For beauty and jewishness, two points"
1,Tanach Review,The Tanach is a scriptual book written for one with a Jewish background. It does not contain commentaries for the scriptures as does the Chumash.
2,Overrated,"I don't know how this helmet got such high reviews.As mentioned by others, the visor is a problem. It is cheap and flimsy. It is made so that you can detach. The holes for the pins on the visor do not snap in all the way and just keep it on. The visor flew off twice today when I hit a moderate wind gust.The shell does not feel like it makes a tight fit with the styrofoam and just looks cheaply made.The only thing this helmet has going for it is the dial for adjusting to different head sizes and it is moderately comfortable. The Giro Indicator is similar in price and puts this helmet to shame."
2,Plastic parts came off,I received the helmet in the mail and opened it to try it. When I put it on I realized that the big plastic part on the top was loose and moving.When I slightly lift it it came out completely. Also the one of black plastic parts on two sides dropped by itself. I can see the glue under the plastic parts. I looked at the same item at Target before buying it Amazon.com and they looked very firm and there was nothing loose. I requested a replacement.Check yours when it arrives.
3,A little disappointed!,"The helmet build seems fine. But, there was an issue with the glue that holds the ridged plastic parts on.When I opened the box on of the plastic pieces was off. Upon inspection I noticed all the plastic was loose.Rather than messing with a return I got out the super glue. This did the the trick just fine. I do like thedial fit and again the helmet seems otherwise solid. Hopefully just a bad glue day at the factory."
2,Shoddily made and limited customer service,"I bought this helmet based on the excellent reviews, but the piece in the back used to tighten the plastic strap fell out after about 2 weeks of light usage. I can't find it anywhere, making this helmet essentially useless. I called Schwinn, and they don't have any replacement parts so I'll have to buy a new helmet when only one piece of mine is missing. Many other bike companies have excellent customer service, but Schwinn is not one of them. I also do not like how the visor clips in and out."
4,"Fits my rather large head, seems fine","I bought this after the Giro didn't fit my head. This is nowhere as good of a quality as the Giro but if you wear the largest hats/caps and even then your head barely fits, then this is for you and the Giro is not."
4,good price/quality ratio,"I strongly recommend this product. It is very safe and stable. It has enough holes so that your head still cools down (this is typical problem with other ones). It is a little heavier than very expensive ones, if you are not a triathlon biker you will be fine. Shipping is excellent."
3,Great Bottom Line Cheep Helmet,This is a great helmet if you need a cheep helmet. It's a little heavy and bulky but it works. I use it as a spare when a damage a good helmet.
2,Didn't fit my head,"After reading other reviews for this and people saying they had a large head and it fit them I pulled the trigger and purchased this item. It arrived today and I put it on, sort of... The darn thing doesn't fit my head! I turned the dial to make it as large as possible and even at the largest setting it just doesn't sit right on my head. And I'm not a large guy at all.The helmet itself looks decent, but I have to give it low rating because it doesn't fit and it's not comfortable to me even at the largest setting. Guess I will need to run down to the local store and get a helmet after I can try them on for size.This adult adjustable does NOT fit all head sizes."
2,HELMET,The helmet arrived with several plastic pieces separate of the helmet. I have tried to fix it but I couldn't.
1,Plastic Not Adhered to Shell,"I ordered once... returned, replacement had the same problem - the 2 pieces on the back fall right off, and the top part is not sticking either. sent second one back."
1,Serious glue problem !!!,"It's a shame!! It look really nice but when I just remove the helmet of the box, plastic components began to detach !!!"
2,well I got all the pieces... some assembly required?,"Most of the plastic had come unglued before I even took it out of the box. I can see that it was glued at some point, but they did not put enough obviously. I can just glue it on myself, but still a hassle."
2,Product very cheap,This helmet is made very cheaply. Right when I opened the box and picked up the helmet a side plastic piece fell off.
4,fits my big head....,"i bought this as a secondary helmet for friends who may want to ride. But the helmet fits my big head well, so i'll make this my primary helmet now. some of the plastic covering pieces already came off (needs more glue). other than that, can't beat the price..."
1,poor quality,This was broken and falling apart when I got it! It is very poor quality! I would not buy this.
5,Everything I hoped it would be,"Sorry I don't have a cool crash story to exemplify how great a helmet this is. But I can say it fits snug and comfortable with a few adjustments. Fortunately, the straps on this helmet lay flat against your face unlike another helmet that also got great reviews. That said, it's important to spend several minutes adjusting and tightening the straps until they are just right. With this done, you will barely notice the helmet and will be more able to focus in your ride."
3,Nice fitting and looking helmet cheaply made,Helmet looks great fits well i love the back of the head adjustment.The bad: the plastic pieces on the outside of the helmet fell off when i took them out of the box. either the glue got hot or these are really old. I will take superglue and put them back on.overall good basic helmet
2,Cheaply made,"It's made of styrofoam and the plastic exterior is SO thin. I worry about my safety when wearing this. I will be returning it and buying something that is of higher quality. It made cost more, but I better be safe than sorry."
3,Seems solid and great comfort,"This is only my second helmet, so consider that. Great price, comfortable and cool looking. I hope I never actually need to experience how hard it is."
4,Great looking bike helmet.,"This is a highly adjustable bike helmet that would fit almost any size head! The only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars is that the plastic panels that cover the helmet were pretty loosly glued on and on was actually sitting in the bag when it arrived, however this is a very minimal problem as i had it super glued in a couple of minutes however i was expecting it to be a little bit better than that! Also getting the helmet snug on your head is pretty easy but getting it tighter is pretty uncomfortable as the adjuster at the back feels like its digging into my head a little but i could easily fix that and am not too worried at the moment. Overall great helmet for the price, a pretty impressive product! Would recommend of you're on a tight budget or just want to save some money."
1,Disintegrated right after 30 days - DO NOT BUY,"The plastic shell pieces started falling off, so I super glued them back on like others. Then, a couple days later, the back size wheel broke off, making the helmet loose and unusable because it won't fit on my head. Wasted $20 on this thing and Amazon won't let me return it because it's past 30 days. Thanks a lot"
3,I have a big head...,"... and I'm not talking about my ego. I've always liked Schwinn products, and this one seems to be excellent - except that it doesn't fit my long 7 1/2 size head. If you wear a size 7 or smaller hat, then this should be a great helmet for you. The dial adjuster on the back is super easy to use with the helmet on, and the cam locks on the side straps seem to be very secure. There's even enough length to the straps to leave some room for adjustment under my chin (which was a problem with my old Specialized helmet).Unfortunately, I'll be returning this and getting aBell XLV Bike Helmetinstead. If any of the Schwinn helmets on Amazon were clearly listed as fitting an XL head size, I'd stay with my loyalties."
3,"OK helmet, but buy it elsewhere if you really want it!","This is an OK helmet for an amateur biker but beware that purchasing it on Amazon, the warehouse packaged it in a box that was too narrow, resulting in the glued-on plastic pieces coming off and laying loose in the box. Lightly glued-on plastic pieces that came off pretty easy, really? I returned it and could have bought it at a local store for about the same price but noticing the plastic pieces coming off that easy made me go with a GiroGiro Indicator Sport Bike HelmetSave yourself the return hassle and the crappy lightly-glued on plastic covers!3 stars for a semi-ok cheap product but 1 star on shipping. Since I am rating the product, not the shipping, I will leave it at three stars (It's amazing how many people will reduce stars for reason that are not the fault of the product itself!)"
1,styrofoam & glue,"This is just Styrofoam with thin plastic decorative plates glued on, arrived with pieces falling off and loose.Styrofoam may work, but badly made and very cheap, nothing good to say... just get out the low temp glue gun to stick decorations back on, i guess... very poor product."
3,Substandard,The visor on this helmet doesn't stay on. It's a design flaw. I hate when people sell something with known design flaws. Basically it's styrofoam glued to a plastic shell and a visor that doesn't fit. I don't know what else to say. Not much good to say. Well it's light weight.
3,Needs better glue,"fairly comfortable, but two of the plastic covers on the back of the helmet fell off during transit. I don't think I can use super glue as it may melt the foam, so I'll try Elmer's glue.and probably as a result of the price, much of the padding inside seems to be attached solely by little patches of velcro."
4,Safety First,"Our son rides over 8 miles a day, to and from his job. We feel much safer with him using this helmet."
2,received today... and already falling apart.,"I just got this helmet in the mail today. and as i was trying it on, i hear a ""clank!"" One of the plastic panels that are basically glued onto the exterior of the helmet fell off.I inspected the other panels, and the glue on those were very weak. I'm going to try to super glue them back on, but a product shouldn't come in this kind of condition. It seems like it was hastily made with little attention to detail.No doubt, this is a decent helmet that will probably protect your skull from injury, but for anyone thinking of buying this, you should also buy a tube of super glue in addition."
2,Poor quality,This product arrived and the black plastic trim on the back was lying loose in the box having already fallen off! Spend a couple more dollars and buy a better product!
1,Not durable,"Within the first week the visor/brim became loose and would no longer fit into the slots so whenever its windy, the brim flaps in the wind. Then the knob to adjust the size of the helmet fell off so it no longer fits properly. If that's not bad enough the straps for the helmet came inverted but the clips are fixed in such a way that it can't be easily fixed. This is definitely a poor quality product and I've only had it for less than a year."
2,poor quality,"i bought this trusting the many good reviews but got disappointed, it is of pretty poor quality and its not confortable at all, do not buy this trust me!!!"
2,Not a quality product,Cheaply made. The plastic proctectors all came off just after a few times wearing it. I had to super glue them all back down. It does not give me the safe feeling when I am riding. I would spend a little more money and find something nicer.
1,14+ my foot,"This is supposedly a 1 size fits all (14+) helmet, but the only way I can get it to be tight on my head is to have one of the straps hook up all the way up the side of my chin, not under the chin like you're supposed to.Also, the ""dial fit adjustable system"" does NOT add ease. It is so loose that you have to readjust it every time you put the helmet on.I was expecting a good helmet and was very disappointed."
2,Schwinn Helmet,"Just got this helmet the other day. I figured I'd get it despite the bad reviews or photos of the shell falling off...well, surprise, when it came it the side panels were off and the top part was able to come off with the push of a finger. Now I know all that part is just a shell for look, but if it comes off that easy, I'm not going to rely on it to protect my head if need be. Going to spend the extra $15 to get a better one."
3,Lacking some quality,"The helmet is functional and will do the job, but both sides of the helmet had superficial plastic pieces pop off immediately after pulling it from the package. They can easily be glued back on, but they shouldn't come off so readily in the first place."
4,Just what I ordered.,I'd been wanting and looking for one at the right price for a while. I haven't used it yet...but it looks great.
5,Good Helmet,"It's simple, stylish, and fits comfortably; sometimes I forget I'm even wearing it after I get back from a ride. If you're looking for a good helmet for a decent price and a comfortable fit I'd definitely try this helmet out."
5,"Quality, inexpensive helment",This helmet has it all!-Comfortable fit with straps that ensure a secure placement-Vents on the top to keep your head cool in-Front visor to shield from sunlight-Attractive styling-Great priceCan't ask for more! I recommend this guy for anyone that likes their dollar to go a long way
5,Schwinn Thrash Micro....,"Due to high blood pressure I started riding a bicycle again after about 35 years....Actually I did not want to wear a bike helmet....My wife, son and local bike shop salesman/mechanic have all been telling me that I needed one...Sooo I gave in and did some research....After reading some reviews and seeing that this helmet would fit someone with a big head....I ordered one...It fits me very well...feels secure...is very adjustable and actually looks kinda cool...The carbon fiber finish fits in nicely with my bike....I'll wear this one....."
5,basic cheap helmet that works,I got a new bike and was never a helmet wearer and didnt' want something expensive. This is comfortable and looks as good as a cheap helmet is going to look. lightweight and comfortable too. Good for a casual biker like me.
5,excellent! why pay more?,"All helmets have to meet the same safety requirements. It's comfortable and has a lot of breathing vents so your head doesn't heat up. I like it and it comes at a very good price. Unless you are a professional rider, you don't need anything else.Why pay more for another helmet, you are just paying for the brand."
2,THICK,"When I read the word micro I assumed it was one of the thinner style helmets. It is not. The thing sticks out pretty far on the sides of your head and on top. Not as bad as the solid mushroom looking kids helmets, but pretty close. It does adjust easily and would fit on many different size heads. The carbon fiber black look of it is nice and the visor is decent. However, due to the thickness of the foam I will not be using this particular helmet."
2,Dont buy this!!!,"When I ordered this product I needed a helmet really soon for a charity ride, however when it came it was in pieces. The plasic that covers the helmet was glued with the worst possible glue and came off when I picked it up out of the box! I thought well I got what I paid for however a few days later I saw a friend with a new helmet that was really good and he had only paid $10 more for it!"
1,Broken on Arrival,"I read a few other reviews that said that the helmet fell apart when they took it out of the box. I ignored these and thought they must be flukes. However, mine also fell apart as soon as it was taken out of the box. I certainly do not trust a helmet that can't even protect itself being shipped in a air-packet-padded box!"
4,Truly adjustable,"This helmet is completely adjustable to fit my head perfectly. I originally purchased a different brand that was labeled Med/Lge but, it did not fit at all and I could not adjust it. This one has a twist screw on the back so you can adjust it more precisely."
3,"Great, but..","It's great but some plastic parts fell the very first day, I glued them on again. Other than that, it's a really good product."
3,quality is not as good,the plastic cover over the main part of the helmet is not glued properly. The two side black plastics came out in a week. the top one still exists. the inner material looks decent though
1,cheap bicycle helmet,"Very poor quality helmet. Plastic trim pieces that were paper thin were not even stuck to the helmet and others were missing. This helmet is made out of foam and it is painted black, it would not take much to break this helmet, I wouldn't feel safe in it. I would look at purchasing other helmets on the market."
2,Falls apart,"I rated this two stars, because the plastic shell has separated from the foam part. The helmet lasted about two weeks before one of the plastic pieces on the back fell off. Today, the large plastic piece fell off.I like how easy this helmet was to adjust and how comfortable it was to wear. I dislike how easily it came apart. It was either on my head or in my bag. No rough use, whatsoever.This product is only recommended for infrequent riders looking for a very inexpensive helmet. It is your head, protect it."
4,nice and comfy,Arrived quickly with no damage. Nice looking and very comfortable -- makes wearing it less of a hassel. I would recommend the product and the seller.
3,"one good, one bad","ordered 2 of these for my wife and my self. mine was fine and really fit well. my wife's has the chin strap twisted and very difficult to fasten. i undid the strap and trying to rethread it, but not much luck. try again tomorrow, but might have to order another one. must have been an assembly mistake. too bad, because for the price it seemed like a good deal. i agree with the visor. very flimsy and pretty useless after about 3 up and downs. i wear sunglasses, so it's gone."
2,Schwinn Thrasher Helmet,"There are two black plastic pannels on the exterior of the helmet that cover the styrofoam near the ears, one on each side, that fell off the helmet during shipping. I was able to glue them back on, but was disappointed and a bit concerned that they were not firmly attached in the first place."
3,Shoddy glue,"Immediately out of the package, one of the three plastic exterior components fell off, and the other one followed suit within a day. The largest piece (the patterned portion) hasn't come free, but the back portion of it is loose and has thus far resisted my attempts to re-attach it. All this said, I don't imagine these pieces do much other than add to its aesthetics, so at least it's still relatively functional."
2,Not Recommended,"The back strap hangs way lower than the back of the helmet. I don't know if that's normal or not, but I doubt it.E-mails with photos have been ignored by Schwinn.When I tried calling them, their support voicemail system was confusing."
2,Bad Shipment,"Helmet arrived in bad shape, I don't know if I need to blame the packaging or the product itself. Really disappointed with the shipment/product."
4,Nice helmet for the price,This helmet is very comfortable and also it is easy to adjust the fit. Great pick for a casual bicyclist.
3,Falling Apart After a Few Months,"I bought this helmet from a Walmart about 3 months ago. I use it probably 3 times a week for about an hour or two each ride. Never crashed or dropped it or anything, its either been in the house for storing or on my head during bike rides. Despite this, it is falling apart; the design piece on the outside has warped due to heat, 1 of the black pieces on the rear outside of the helmet has fallen off, and half of the foam inserts inside have fallen off (adhesive is not good). The visor also randomly kicks up while riding. Its an ok helmet but don't expect it to look new after a while. Despite these faults, which are mostly cosmetic, its still a decent helmet. Its easy to adjust, the vents keep my head cool, but most importantly it will protect my head during a crash. Even with its faults, I'll use it until it can no longer be used."
5,Saved My Life,"I was out riding my bike on a rough trail and my back wheel hit a large rock that threw me over my handlebars. If it had not been for this helmet, I do not know if I would be here today (maybe a little exaggerated). The bike had landed on top of me with the back wheel right on my head. When I gained consciousness, the helmet had not only prevented my head from slamming into the dirt, but it was holding the bike over my head. When I got home I checked the helmet and it was barely scratched! This helmet is comfortable, stylish, and customizable to fit your head. I love this helmet and I will definitely recommend it to all my friends and family."
5,Brain Protection,"What can you possibly say about bicycle helmets? No helmet will win a fashion award, but this one is as good as they come. Haven't tested it with an accident yet, but I do find it comfortable, easily adjusted for size and not all that bad looking. I didn't feel the need to pay $80 for a helmet and compared it to others in a retail store before ordering from Amazon."
5,This Helmet Saved My Life,"I was riding down the west side greenway this morning in Manhattan. A enormous burst of wind caught me by surprise and I was unable to recover. I went down in an instant and felt an enormous thud on the side of my head. I sat on the ground for a few seconds making sure all my body parts were in the right places. I was shaken up, but not in any serious pain, so I stood up and dusted myself off. I took off my helmet to wipe my forehead. I then noticed that the helmet was in pieces strewn along the greenway and a large chunk had broken off during the fall.I don't know where I would have been if it weren't for this helmet. Thanks!!!"
3,"Alright, but you get what you pay for.","I ordered this helmet because of a tight budget and figured that all helmets were generally the same. The first day I got it, the visor fell off and when I tried pushing it back in place, I dented the plastic around the hole. I'm sure it protects your head fine and it feel comfortable enough, but it looks cheap and feels cheap. Of course, I'll keep wearing it anyway but will probably get something else in the next 6 months or so."
2,Not for looks....,"This helmet is cheap and probably functional...but if you are going for looks, it is terrible. The cheap plastic comes off easily. I had to glue the pieces back on, then I said forget it. You get what you pay for."
4,"Not pretty, but very comfortable to wear.",It's fit well. There is a note at the rear that allows you to adjust the fitting. This is my first bicycle helmet.
2,Cheap but not good,"Pros: the helmet is really cheap, and really fit my Asian head. I really like the way it fits me. Not a lot of helmet in US market nowadays fits Asian heads well.Cons: the helmet quality is not as good as expected. the shell part is glued with the foam part. after more than a month's use, maybe because the weather and I rode a lot, the glue seems weaker. Because the helmet is the key part to protect your head during biking, I strongly recommend you buy a more expensive and better helmet at least $35."
4,Solid helmet,"Great, comfortable helmet. Has a dial on the back that allows the wearer to adjust the size of the helmet for a better fit. My only gripe with this helmet is that the visor falls off fairly easily. However, it can easily be re-attached. Good purchase for only $20."
5,Great looking Bike Helmet,Chose this helmet because I have a Schwinn bike. It looks and fits great. Very comfortable. Well made. Would definitely recommend.
5,Fits great!,"I ordered two of these helmets. My head is, umm, oversized. My wife's head is a more normal size. They fit both of us equally well. Adjusting the size is super easy with the knob on the back. For a helmet it's pretty comfortable too, very well ventilated."
4,Solid helmet for the price,"This Schwinn helmet is very reasonably priced for what you get. It is solid and I'm certain it would likely save my noggin in the event of a pavement/rock/tree attack. The highly adjustable design makes the fit tight and comfortable. The helmet provides great ventilation of my scalp and helps to avoid overheating. My only complaint is that this unit is huge and more unattractive than I expected based upon the images provided, but, for the price and solid build, I can't really complain. I'm pleased with the purchase."
4,Protection is far more important anyway,Very good product. I'm just a bit disappointed by the quality in the sense that the stylish cover of the helmet is not well stuck and I'm affraid it's going to come out. But who cares... as long as you have something on your head to protect you !
5,Helmet saved my life !!!!!,"I am a kid 17 years old. On March 24, 2011 approximately around 8:00p.m. I had an accident on bike, a car ran me over and I went flying off my bike and hit my head on the street but with the helmet on. Then I check the helmet and there was absolutely no types of scratches or dents. Im like ""Wow"" ... If it werent for the helmet I would have hit my head hard enough to start bleeding."
1,Junk.,"Straps are uncomfortable and had to be readjusted every time I put the helmet on. The plastic piece in the front was constantly coming off from the day I bought it. Then after a few months, the whole top cover popped off. The plastic pieces in the back followed shortly after.Buy a better one."
1,Poor quality/Made in China,"The side strap on the one side was installed twisted and is impossible to adjust. On the other side, the clasp doesn't rotate down to hold the straps in place. The pads are velcroed on haphazardly. Not happy with this helmet."
3,Not so micro! Good value,"This helmet is decent, especially for the great price. It doesn't look to bulky, although I wouldn't say it is a sleek as other higher end brands. The big issue I had with it was the size. I am a woman with an average sized head, and this helmet is a bit loose on me, even with the pads inside. Obviously it is safest to have a tightly fitting helmet, not to mention it is not as comfortable to have a helmet that rattles around on your head. I think using the word ""micro"" to describe this helmet is pretty misleading. If you have a smaller head, you may want to look elsewhere."
2,Plastic edge falls off...,"This is a nice helmet but the plastic brim fell off pretty readily. It also leaves dimples in my hair in the shape of the helmet. While not a big deal, it isn't great to go into work with this hair style ;)"
3,Good product but not the best.,"This was a good product, however, the only but I have is that the vinyl plastic is not glued on the edges to the Styrofoam material. The local sports store had a similar one for the same price-but I din't get it because they (local sports store) also had one with the vinyl glued to the Styrofoam, which look much better. But for twice as much the money.In the end this helmet is ok. The minor details should only be considered if you want the best looking helmet."
1,2 different helmets fell apart within first week of receiving,"I purchased this helmet based on reviews and when I received it, I was very happy - It looked great and fit great too. Then, within the first week, the plastic shell began warping in several places from sunlight/summer heat and separated from the Styrofoam helmet body. I live by the beach in Los Angeles.I returned the defective helmet to Amazon for a replacement and within a week of receiving the replacement, it also warped and separated from the helmet body, leaving me with the equivalent of a toddler's Styrofoam starter helmet. I am very disappointed with the quality of this helmet and would not recommend for anyone who lives where it is hot and sunny."
5,Great Product.,"I read the other reviews about the plastic separating from the hard foam. I didn't have the problem. This is great very comfortable and adjusts easy.I have more expensive helmets, and just want an extra. I find myself wearing this one more then the other ones.2013-01-10UPDATE OK I was wrong! I did have separation. It was a the lower part plastic that came off. I just used superglue to reattached. I do think it was because of the cold. I know I am in California but it was 42 out. I would still buy again."
4,"Good price, but the rope of the hamlet is not good, either.",The price and deal is attracting. But the rope on the hamlet which is uesed to bound it on your head is not quite easily to be handled.
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought this helmet because it was the cheapest one, so I kind of knew what to expect. It is what it is, for the price. Upon opening the box I found that some non-essential plastic pieces had come unglued. Sure, the helmet still functions, but that seems to be the general quality of assembly. Just sayin', no one's happy to buy a new product that's falling apart.In short, if you want to wear some styrophome on head while riding your bike to prevent serious injury both to yourself and your wallet, this is it. If however you want to wear a decent quality helmet, I would suggest forking over another $10-$20 on a nicer one."
2,I hope there is better on the way...,"This book disappointed me - I read the online docs that became ""Learning Cocoa"", and liked them quite a bit, so I expected a similar book in ""Learning Carbon"". I was wrong.I bought both as hard copies because the Cocoa one was such a great little reference, but this book contains a number of errors in the samples, doesn't cover a lot of very relevant details, and doesn't give you a good ""feel"" for the Carbon API. I learned more reading through the headers for a few hours than I did from reading this book."
2,Programmers Need Not Apply,"There is absolutely NO CODE in this book. This publication is geared towards the newbie (I should have known... CyberRookies!) gamer who wants to build a game but has never gone through the process of developing anything. (...) Hence, the level of freedom you can get is severely curtailed. Sure, there is good software in this book, but if you must buy it, I suggest you don't open the CD packet so that you may return the book WHEN (not IF) you dislike it.To the book's credit, the title isn't terribly misleading... He should have said ""(...bad) 3D Game Creation with No Programming Required"". You can't possibly make something worth playing (or getting money for) with no programming effort required! It's not possible!Bottom line: if you want to build a (...bad) game in 20 minutes with graphics quality like the early 90's, with rookie software, then this book is for you..."
5,Have to spray it on them allot,The pups dont care for the smell they go a bonkers. Very clovey smelling. You have to apply it daily.
3,Didn't need it,"I really didn't need this book, but it seemed like a good idea at the time to order it, so I can't really give an accurate review"
2,The Forest,"Textbooks are notorious for delving into the minutia of every little thing. With that I sometimes get lost. The CQR A & P is a great way to preview the ""forest"" before hitting the textbook to examine the ""bark on every tree""."
5,Worth getting for all A&P Students,"I bought this book shortly after my first A&P Exam, which I did very well on. I made my own summary notes of each chapter in my A&P book and it took hours. Then I saw this book and was amazed at how detailed and easy-to-understand most of the information is. I could've saved alot of time if I had this book. I think it's a great addition to any A&P book."
4,great - just faboulous!,i love the game yoshis story & this book helped me out alot plus it had a list of all enemies and items!! a musthave 4 any yoshis story gamer!!
4,"It may start out pretty bad, but just keep reading!","Now, I must admit that I personally thought that the first two acts were very boring. Act One revolved around the average day in a small town in New Hampshire called Grover's Corners. The people are any average people and there is little plot to the first act. In the second act, there is slightly more action when two local people get married. But I did like the end. I wouldn't exactly want to give it away so I won't say anything about Act Three but it is inspirational and it makes you think for a long time after reading it. The small town setting may seem boring, but in my opinion it just gives more meaning to the sending. If it weren't for book reports, I would have never been able to read this classic, and I'm extremely glad I did. Note to ya'll: I gave it four starts because of the first two acts, but the last one makes up for it all."
3,A Review of Our Town,"I found Our Town to be a very thought provoking story/play. Although it is very short, you learn an incredible amount of information about the lives and characters in the story. I think that although the book was based in a time period alternate from our own, the character and plot development could be closely related to our own lives i.e. (George and Emily growing up and developing a relationship). This book, although fiction accurately portrays and relates to our own lives. The ending, although a tad bit obscure, presents a valid and thought-provoking moral to the readers. Overall, I would rate this book with a three only because of the ending, and the lack of overall content. Otherwise, this book was very interesting to read and I enjoyed it."
3,Alexis Santiago's review of Our Town,"Overall I gave Our Town 3 stars. I felt it was mediocre. It didn't have that many exciting parts, but it was not that dull for the most part. My 1st exposure to the play Our Town was by a crazy substitute teacher that made us act out our practically imaginary parts. I found it ridiculous and quite boring. As we started just reading the parts then I looked into them a little more and found out the deeper meaning to the book. Well as deep as is possibly went. I think that this book would mean a lot more to me if I were older. It talks about how we waste so much of life and it goes so fast so we go fast with it, that we don't stop and enjoy things once and a while. I think I will remember this book after I'm dead and realize how meaningful it is. Until then it was kind of a comical waste of time"
3,Our Town,"""Our Town"" by Thornton Wilder is a short play about living in a normal town with normal people. Later in the play, two characters named George and Emily, get married at early ages. Getting married at an early age is common in Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. At first, the two teenagers feel that it's going to be hard to get to know each other better and to grow to love one another. They end up having a happy life together. The only weird thing about this play when we read it as a class was when the characters started talking out loud when they were supposed to be dead. I thought it was very strange, but other than that the play was pretty good. I recommend this book because the characters are like everyday people who live normal lifestyles. I wouldn't recommend this book to people who don't have any patience. You have to be patient to be able to sit down and slowly move through this play."
5,An eye opener,"It is a play that reads well. It is a timeless tale that is compact, tightly told, and after you put it down you simply say, ""Jeez, I gotta change the way I live."""
3,Nothing Happened,"It appears that I am in the minority for not being a big fan of ""Our Town"". I do not think it is poorly written or an inaccurate representation of the American landscape. My objection is that nothing happened. Writing 101 says that a good story needs a conflict. ""Our Town"" really has no conflict. It is just a sample of American life in the early 20th century in Grover's Corners, New Hampshire.If you grew up in a smaller town like I did, you can appreciate many of the nuances of the story. You can see the children of the town grow up, get married, and later die. It is a sad but beautiful sample of life, yet there seems to be no conflict in Grover's Corners. How unlike real life this is."
2,not what i expected,"When we began to read this in school I thought it would be a fascinating story about something extraordinary that occurs in a small town. As I later found out it was about normal, ordinary, plain, bland everyday life. The message and story were wonderful but slow. Not a good book for a reader who likes action. This is best for people who are patient and enjoy seeking the deeper meaning in a book. I did love the paradox of the adress on the envelope that Rebecca is explaining to George. If you get by how plain the people's lives were I think you shall find this to be a wonderful book with the a wonderful message:just because life is ordinary it doesn't mean it's not special."
3,Love Town,"I marked Our Town as 'Love town' because through reading this novel it seems as though Wilder is trying to portray what most see as the picture perfect American World. Wilder portrays the characters as being the perfect loving family and community when the real world is unfortunately violent, disrespectful, and pretty much the opposite of Wilder's picture portrayed in his writings.I do commend Wilder for his writings because his writings are portraying what we wish the world would be like to some extent.As with all books and authors Wilder has many ups and downs in his works.T. Lynn, Tiffin, Ohio USA"
2,How boring can a book get?!?!?,"This book was so boring. Thanks to the school, I didn't throw it away. I usually like good plays like Shakespeare's and Miller's, which, too, can get boring, but always get much better later on. This book was boring all the way! The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one was because I kind of liked how the girl realizes how preshis life is. There are better plays then this. I hear this book won a big award. Pathetic. The movie was even more boring, but thanks to it I didn't fail my test."
3,Like a good childrens story,"Our Town is a very unelaborate tale of life, marriage, and death in a small town around the turn of the century. When I first read this years ago, I was surprised how moved I was by such a simply written play, but on reading it a second time, I was bored. It's too straightforward for my taste, and the theme can be summarized quite nicely in a couple words: Carpe diem, or something like that. If you don't feel like you ""realize life while [you] live it,"" then pick up Our Town. If you want to something to think about, maybe you should put it down."
4,"So Simple, So Wonderful",This is such a powerful play and it really comes alive as much on the written page as it does on the stage. There really is nothing like it for American theater.
4,"""Normal"" life","I think that Thornton Wilder is a good playwright who understands how to write a story that deals with almost every common people. I think it's a little bit boring when the stage manager talks about the town on the stage. It's o.k. when he said two, three sentences but not page after page, like in act one. Wilder divides the play into three parts (daily life and birth, love and marriage, and death) and I think that these three stages in life are the most important factors in one's biography to make this whole play interesting. He discribes normal life very well.The 3rd act, where the dead talk together, is very special and I think that is one of the most interesting parts. I like it very much because I think it's something different to talk about. Why don't the living people heed their message?"
3,good and bad at the same time,"It's about normal family life, about being born, getting married and dying. How boring is that if you think about it at first. Just another every-day-story. But the way it is written and being played makes it all up. It is totally different to all the other books I have ever read. I only finished the play because of this very reason. You can imagine your own landscape to the story, you can imagine yourself how ""your town"" is gonna look like, and that makes it interesting especially for yourself."
3,Not really my thing,"We've read 'Our Town' in English class. At the beginning I read it enthusiastically but unfortunately only the first few pages. Then it seemed to me so boring that I really had to overpower myself to go on reading. The first and the second act just describe places of the play, persons and their daily life. Only the third act did I find interesting again. Why? Because it has one clear message for me. Look at your life, make it better by respecting every little thing, because no one lives forever."
4,One of America's greatest plays,"This is not one of my favorite plays but I still believe that it is important to read. In this play, Thornton Wilder makes us think about what life really is. He makes us see that it isn't the material things we have, but that life is more than that; it's love, being content with your life if not satisfied, the fact that people don't appreciate what they have until it's gone, and finally that death isn't the end but only the beginning of something greater."
3,Well Balanced,"This book had a lot of town life experiences. While it was not interesting to us, someone who enjoys a low key story should read it. At times it can be depressing, but there are also times when you laugh out loud. Mr. Wilder has a play that acts out many simple events in human life. It was an easy read and fairly enjoyable."
4,"Easy reading, well developed, easy flowing, three act play!","I would have to say that Our Town is one of the best plays I have read. I thought it was really good in the beginning and then the pace slowed down a little at the end of the first act and through the second. But now, it's picking the pace back up. If you're looking for a summary of the play, Our Town is about a small town in New Hampshire. The play goes through the lives of the people in Grover's town, this small town. In particular, twon families, the Webb and the Gibbs. George Gibbs, who is the oldest son of the Gibbs family marries Emily Webb, the oldest daughter of the Webb family. The play is composed of three acts and goes through the ups and downs of these two families. Focusing, on Emily and George. I would recommend this to someone who wants an easy reading well developed flowing read. Our Town reads very quickly but yet, goes into detail."
4,Jake Mayz (live life to the fullest...),"As I reflect on the playwright ""Our Town,"" I just want to make clear on how good of a message it gave out. The message that I got from the book was to live life to the fullest. You never know when you're going to die, it could be today, tomorrow, or next year. Life is too short, but over all I felt that the book was a great piece of writing. The playwright was well written and the message was put into the writing very well."
4,A Different Style of Play,"Thornton Wilder's play is different. There is no scenary, the first play of that kind. It takes place in a small Anytown, USA named Grover's Corners. It occurs in the early 1900s and has the act names of Daily Life, Love and Marriage, and Death. Half of our English class enjoyed it, but I feel it would be better to watch than read, like most plays. The only question I have for you as you read is, Is it celebrating simple life, or criticizing it?"
3,"A Quick and Easy, Good Read","Thornton Wilder's Our Town is a very short read, yet it is crammed with tons of wisdom, and real life situations. The play starts out in Act 1 introducing you to two all American families that live next door to each other. As the play progresses, you get an inside look on just who these people really are, and watch them grow and really expierence life as the years pass. They touch base with many memorable situations that we all go through such as the celebration of marriage, and the facts of death that we all muct eventually face. Ending with an unusual twist, this heartwarming yet eye-opening story is truely original."
1,Unbelievable!!,"A completely unnecessary book. Our Town is a great play, full of complexities. But it is not written in Ancient Hibernian. It is written in good simple English. How could anyone need Cliff's Notes to understand this play? If you need these kind of notes to make sense of Our Town, you are too stupid to be reading anything at all."
2,"A story about daily life, marriage and death","Our Town is a play about a little town called Grover's Corners in New Hampshire before the Great Wars. Thornton Wilder is expressing the athmosphere in this town with humor and warmth. He wants to tell us, that there's no need in looking back. You should always look forward into the future. The mean idea of the play is the question about eternal life. Wilder is explaining this question in the third act."
2,"Boring, with udder simplicity","This book was not a life chaging mark. It did not have any solid foundation to grab you and make you want to read more. There is no main conflict. However, it is not the most hideous book to read so I give it two stars instead of one. The whole time I read it I wondered, ""what is the main plot?"" The main quote that is supposed to show the meaning of life was just depressing. The book is short so an english teacher could have found a much worse assignment."
2,This isn't interesting,"I brought it cus it's required by the class I took, yet I don't like this book too much. Maybe cus I don't know how to appreciate it, but it is really a boring book for me"
1,Bad experience,This is the first worst quality copy I have ever received from Amazon labeled as good quality used book. The whole book is discolored with cover and two pages torn and many pages wrinkled. It is unpleasant to handle. I will think twice before buying another used book through Amazon again.
1,Another one of those classics,"Who says what's a classic and what isn't? This is yet another one of those ""classics"" that just bores you to death before anything really happens (if anything ever happens). There really was no plot, no suspense, no action, no drama, or plot twists. The whole story was about a bunch of boring New Englanders going about a very boring existence, some going to school, a marriage that wanted to be, yet didn't want to be, that was poorly acted out, and the stage manager just talking nonsense. The story could've gone without the whole last act since at the very beginning of the story, it pretty much begged to be ended."
1,Our Town,"this is a very stupid play, i cant understand it, it makes me feel stupid that i say that i need cliffnotes . the cliffnotes are very good for thes people if they need to study for Our Town for exams/finals."
5,THE MOST INCREDIBLE AND INFORMATIVE BOOK EVER WRITTEN FOR THE NYSP!,"The author is BRILLIANT! If you are interested in the history of the New York State Police you need to purchase this book! It is so well put together, you will not want this book to ever end! The only thing you could hope for, is a follow up, a ""Part two"" if you would, for the years 1943 to present! THIS BOOK IS INCREDIBLE! It should be used in the New York State Police Academy!!"
5,Fiona Buckley-A True Diva of Historical Mysteries,"Fiona Buckley's third Ursula Blanchard/de la Roche mystery was a facinating read. The plot was complex, realistic, imaginative,smart, and VERY well-written. I found Ursula to be both a femanist and one overtaken by femanine emotions, a devious antogonist and angelic protagonist, a sage soul in desperate need of guidance. There were parts of this book in which I was laughing. At other parts, I felt like crying. I have perchased this book and urge any lover of a good historical mystery to do so also. The setting is vibrant and well-reasearched, the characters are well-written, the plot is realistic to a facinating degree, and the overall book is a true page-turner. Five stars isn't nearly enough to praise ""A Queen's Ransom"". Fiona Buckley is a true diva not only of historical mysteries, but of writing in general. She is a creative force to be reconned with."
3,"Fair historical atmosphere, wildly improbable plot","I was disappointed in this latest Ursula Blanchard mystery. It is not really a mystery; it is more of an adventure story replete with highly improbable feats, both by Ursula and others. There were also significant gaps in the action. Many of the characters portrayed were so shallow as to become two-dimensional. This book does not really work either as a mystery or as a novel."
2,Has big hoop on it,"This dress is cute but was very disappointed that it had a big hoop at the bottom, very easy for kids to trip on it or bump into things. I don't remember this being in the description of the dress & the picture does not look like it has a hoop at the bottom."
1,they sent the wrong size,"I ordered a size 4-6 for my little girl. The packaging slip said 4-6, but what we received was a size 8-10, which was much too big for her to wear. A total Halloween disappointment, as my little one did not get to wear her otherwise cute princess dress for Trick or Treating. Be careful when dealing with this seller - allow plenty of time to correct mistakes."
5,Can never go wrong with this bible.,"I gave away my bible a few years ago and vowed to replace it. The pages were a little thin, but for the price it was a good deal. i just have to treat it gently. I have several versions of the bible, but my study collection was not complete without this one."
4,Good item,Cons:~Thin material~Not too absorbent~Print fades after a few washingsPros:~The edges are binded which prevents the washcloth and the towel from rolling.~The washscloths and towels are large.~The design is cute.
1,The sellers name says it all!!!! (illteachu) aka; I'll teach you.,Boy I guess it sure does pay to read between the lines print.. The way the item read I thought I was getting all 8 that are in the picture. NOT JUST THREE!! Especially for the PRICE $$$$$$ WOW.. You sure did TEACH Me... Don't expect any repeat business here...M. Ford
3,Brief album of ugly-intellegent ideas moreso then songs,"Producer powerhouse Steve Albini always knew how to sustain tension through atmosphere, but when it came to his own musical outings there were either distorted assaults of artfully constructed noise....or pretentious ramblings on half-baked musical noodling. The full bass sound any modern alternative lover has come to enjoy via such classics as Nirvana's In Utero bearing his trademark is in full effect, no matter how repetitive some of the songwriting actually is. Some of this repetition benefits from their explosive, non-conformist outbursts which heightens the minimalism and nastiness, but more of it tends to chug on, concerned with nothing but expressing itself in a musical cynicism that echoes this jaded frontman's warped genius."
3,beats dave matthews,"This second Shellac album is as entertaining as it is frustrating. Not as strong as ""At Action Park,"" this tends to get bogged down by a few repititions of the same idea, and the opening track, at 12 minutes, goes on far too long to make its point; the song is no more than the same four notes, repeated about 1000 times. On the other hand,""This Is a Picture"" is Shellac at their best: sudden shifts of tempo, through composed, tightly played. Shellac seem to be pointed in a direction which could produce some of the best modern rock going, yet this album, while not a bad one, only gets them half way there."
4,completely lacking,"Completely lacking glam, glitter, silly posturing, effects pedals, giant choruses, etc. I love the sparseness of this recording. I mean, how many bands could make a song like DWDALAYTWYRA rock the way it does with just a few notes, a few fills, and lots of big wide open space and perfectly timed vocals? There's also a wonderfully dry and wicked sense of humor behind many of the songs, as well as some very haunting moments. A great record!"
1,did not like it at all !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I didn't like this book. For one thing, It took way toolong to get to the point. Then she was just aggrevating.She's clinging to a dress while the man she supposedlyloves is about to drown. Please. Then, It skipped arounda lot. I just couldn't get into. I feel that is was a wasteof money to buy it and a waste of time to read it."
3,Screens don't last long enough,"I have the model that precedes this one, Ms2 280 and am disappointed in the length of time that the screens last....7 months. And then when I tried to replace the screens, the plastic head broke due to a bad snap that you are supposed to release to get the new screens in and no heads were available not even from Remmington, so there went a %69 reazor...lousy quality"
3,OK for the price,This product is just OK for the price. The quality is not as good as my old one that I bought many years ago. The clear plastic cap does not work (falls off) all the time. I then just leave it off.
3,Let's be serious,"For an electric shaver, this earns about a 6 on a scale of 1-10. It works, but not well if you have thick or long hair. I'm Italian, so my facial hair is a little thicker than my non-Italian friends. If I haven't shaved for two days or more, the microscreens are nearly useless. I have to whip out the little front cutter, which pulls more hair out than it shaves. But for 26 bucks, what do you expect?"
2,Got what I paid for.,I paid $25 for this. It hurts. I have had it for 4 months replaced the blades once figuring that maybe I got a bad set. I'll replace the shaver next. It leaves my face black. It's worth the price for a throw away razor. I'm going back to Norelco.
3,Remington is a good name,"I purchased two of these shavers, remembering the ad's fromlong ago stating the closest shave or your money back.Well they do not give me a close shave and im finding thatI have to use shaving cream and regular razor..I knowthat everyone is different with different skin types soperhaps my skin type is not suitable for this shaver.I rated this 3 only for my experience."
1,Poor battery performance,"The fully charged shaver lasted only one day. Also, very noisy. I would not buy it if it is $10."
2,Ouch.,"I got suckered into the cheap price for the electric razor and the good reviews on here. But after two weeks of using this thing, I think I've had enough. I have sensitive skin and thought that an electric razor would work better than my Mach 3. I was horribly wrong. Everytime I use this thing, my neck looks like a bad case of leprosy, complete with a couple missed hairs ever inch or so. I'm not a shave every day kind of guy, so after two days of growth, this thing is useless."
5,Electric shaver,This is the my most resent purchase of a Remington razor and I am very happy with this model. In fact I have only used Remington Electric razors all my adult years. (50years)
2,Not very good,I didn't like this shaver. No matter the frequency of use I still had razor bumps and never had a close shave. The shaver didn't do much other than chap my skin.
2,The battery is poor!,"Overall performance is so-so, but the rechargerable battery has really limited capacity. Had better keep it plugged in even when you are not using (you will notice it produces a lot of heat when you recharge it, I am not sure whether this is normal or not)."
2,not good enough,"i bought this shaver because i had had several of the round blade shavers in the past, and had good experiences shaving with the microfoil style in the past. however, when i shaved for the first time, i was very dissappointed. for some reason, the shaver seems to cut 9 of 10 hairs in any particular area, leaving very sparse untouched hairs all over my face. after going over and over my face for close to 10 minutes, the hairs were never cut. I had to finish it off with a disposable razor. having experience with many other electric shavers, i dont think my technique was lacking.Also, this shaver seems extraordinarily loud. dont plan to use it while your roommates or neighbors are sleeping.I wanted to return this item, but apparently my packing slip was thrown away..."
2,Battery Charging Problems,"This would have been a great shaver, especcially for traveling , if it were not for two big problems.First, the battery does not always seem to hold a charge. On my last vacation I had to recharge the shaver 3 times in 1 week!Even after a full charge I would go to use it the next day and it would be totally drained!Second problem is the useless cover that is supposed to protect the head when not in use and when traveling. It is very loose fitting and does not stay on and this is a real problem.Even at the low price paid I would not recommend it. I am eventually going to have to replace it. A real shame..."
2,Not good,"Shave is OK, not great. But be warned that, like other low-end razors, this only works on battery. I.e. if your battery runs out, you cannot plug it in an outlet and continue to use it. If you are half way through a shave - too bad. Given the rather terrible battery life on this thing, that happens an unacceptable amount.This is especially bad given that working direct from an outlet would not cost more to implement - and it's absence is just done to cripple low end razors. Don't be fooled - you're going to have to carry a non-electric razor around anyway given this limitation - so I recommend just not buying this at all."
2,Shaver gave up.,"Used the shaver for around a month and it simply stopped workign after taht. I think it works well, guess I was unfortunate taht it stopped working. Am looking to repair it soon."
4,shaves fine but a little noisy,Good value for money.Shaves fine but the wife says it's too noisy.Also the button to activate trimmer is too easy to press without meaning too.
2,Keep looking. This is a lemon,I bought this shaver and I thought it was a step up from the cheap battery operated one I had. But this was way more money and way less performance. I was just too lazy to send it back so I am stuck. I would feel bad about selling it another person. But I just might do that.
1,Poor Electric Shaver,"This is my first time using a electric shaver, and i must say i'm very disatisfied with it. I don't know if this is the only shaver or every other shaver will give these kind of results. I tried every pre-powder and pre-lotion and there are still strands of hair on my face. It is never like shaving with a normal razor shaver and cream. I had to spent twice the time then normal razor shavers."
3,you get what you pay for,"It does the job, decent shave, though it's a bit noisy, definitely can't use it without waking someone up. I had ordered two and one seemed to be slightly disfunctional. The charge cord doesn't connect to the razor unless it rests in an exact position. It would keep falling off making it annoying to charge."
1,Outer Limits TV Series- 1963,"I haven't bought any of these Outer Limits ( original)sets yet.Looks like from the reviews I've read that they are of poor quality and just a rip off!! This is sad........... I use to watch this as a 10 yr.old child too, what a neat show.I'm REALLY disappointed and I guess I'll have to wait till better copies come along. The Sci-Fi channel use to show these, but they don't anymore.Wish I would of recorded them!!If anyone finds good copies let me know. I love old sci-fi shows, they are my favorites!"
2,Avoid this at all costs,"I'm only giving this two stars because it is a great show. Other than that, there is no reason to buy this collection. You're getting half of season one, with no extra features. Instead, spend another ten- twenty dollars or so, and buy the 2002 release of the entire first season, still available on Amazon. The folks at MGM are pulling a scam in my opinion by releasing this new set...it's called ""spend as little money as possible in the hopes that new fans of the seies will buy this not realizing it was already released in 2002"" Shame on MGM"
5,"Verdict in, stick with your original sets","If this was a re-mastered re-issue of the show, it might be worth the cost or the re-dip, but it isn't. The first DVD box sets of the original two seasons were grainy and nowhere near the quality of the new, definitive ""Twilight Zone"" sets (or ""The Naked City,"" for that matter), but at least they were complete and sensibly-priced. Still, I can't NOT give it 5 stars, because even if someone just starts with this cynically-marketed set, they will discover the best gothic horror sci-fi series ever on television, and that's something. The rest of us will just wait for the Blu-ray ""definitive"" complete series box set.Hollywoodaholic: Confessions of a Screenwriter"
5,leapinglemurs,"One of my favorite all time science fictions and my absolute favorite Outer Limits episode. Written by the great Harlan Ellison. About a man who has to find missing fingers on his hand which is made of glass, and with each finger he finds, he gradually finds out his purpose in life, while throughout the story he is being chased by aliens bent on conquering and destroying earth. It may not sound like much when reading this review, but it is brilliant, though low budget. This was in an era before slick CGI, when storytelling was a priority, not special effects."
1,not satisfactory,Disc one has a defect that affects reproduction of the third episode of each side. More or less in the midle those episodes stop and it's not possible view them. I know other custumer pinted that same defect to you previously and I resent you didn' took any action to solve that problem and sent me a damaged dvd.César Zúñiga
2,Not as good as Season 1,Season 1 set high expectations. Season 2 was a let down. At least is was not as bad as Godfather 3.
4,Always Liked,"The Outer Limits good stories, more of a morals based series than The Twilight Zone which is an irony based show have enjoyed both for ever."
5,"when a comp listens like an album, you know you've got something...","Compilations typically get short shrift from listeners -- they appear, go out of print, and are gone. If exclusive tracks ever resurface, it's on some deluxe retrospective box set.Drag City has put out an eminently listenable gem here. If you bought it for the Pavement song, The Silver Jews, or The Palace Brothers -- you'll listen to it for the protean Royal Trux track, the pre-Califone Red Red Meat track, or the acid-drenched Fruitcake track. There is some superb mid-fi psyche rock here, a true gem from the early days of the indie explosion."
2,Not my kind,I don't like very much this cd 'cause this is not my kind of music. I made a mistake buying it and I think I'm gonna sell it.
5,Can't get the songs out of my head,"This CD is too good to be true. I've played the first 5 songs over and over on my way to and from work and they get better with each listen. The title track is brilliant from its mesmerizing melody and joyous lyrics to a wonderfully timed 4 bars of drums at the end. And the other 8 selections blend perfectly with the start. Just great. It's displaced Roland Orzabel for my ""drive to work CD"", and that is no small feat!"
5,Worth waiting for,"Any U2 or Peter Gabriel fan will enjoy this CD. Not sure who influenced who, but styles are very similiar. Daniel really outdid himself on this new release. The ""theme"" of the CD really flows from beginning to end. Highly recommended. His style remains well intact."
5,"A desert island disc, without hesitation!","If you don't like this album, well, you're just plain stupid! Perfect for campfires and Sundays... ok, four more words, there."
4,Excellent Start ... Then after the fifth song,"I heard the National Public Radio interview with Dan Lanois ... the music and lyrics were great. I listened again on Amazon.com ... you know, the little snippets of music. WOW! Loved the first five songs ... but those were the only ones you could listen to on the computer.Anyway, I ordered the CD ""Shine"" for my wife for Mother's Day ... we loved the first five songs ... I knew she would. But then came the rest ... OK ... but he should not have included these remaining pieces on the CD ... he should have stayed with the ""feeling"" of the first five songs.A bit disappointing ... hopefully he won't do this again."
3,"very good music, but...","I really enjoyed Lanois's Love of W. disc over ten years ago. While there is much good atmospheric music here, there's just not enough kick or spark or songs for that matter. I am drawn to him because of his stature in the music business and I can hear why ""bigger"" artists are drawn to him, but this disc did not take make where his previous disc did--and it was very expensive at Tower Records."
4,And Now for Something a Little Different,"The decision by Slaid to do an album of covers is a fantastic one. Aside from the fact that we get to hear a unique Slaid take on songs that many of us are already familiar with, it marks a small bend in the road of Cleaves career. Another album in the tradition of Wishbones and Broke Down may have satisfied most fans (including this reviewer), but this album is a little something different from the sound (fuller, more polished) to the choice of songs (more diverse subject matter) which is a hopeful indication that in the years to come we can all expect for Slaid to keep challenging himself and us with his music. Great musicians take chances and while this album is not a radical departure from his others, it does indicate that he is not content to keep reproducing the same songs over and over. Overall, very well done."
2,Looks great but cheap and non-responsive,"Looks great but cheap and non-responsiveThe position of the \ key annoys me greatly. I should have noticed this before I purchased it. But the biggest problem is they it doesn't always register my key presses. You have to be sure to press the key all the way down or it will ignore you. Like most keyboards, the keys give you a fair amount of resistance until you push hard enough to get past a threshold where the key moves easily. But on this ViewSonic keyboard, that threshold point is not useful feedback but is instead an annoying trick. Pushing the key past this threshold is not enough to register as a key press. I often think I pressed the key but the computer doesn't agree. This one is going in the trash."
3,Basic and sleek,"This keyboard looks good, but it's a little small key wise. Not enough room for my hands to move. Also, it feels like it's cheaply made. It has an annoying problem where it will shut off for no apparent reason, forcing me to unplug it and then plug it back in. Although, that might not be the keyboard's fault, it could be my USB drivers. Still, I think I will stick with Logitech in the future."
3,Okay if you like it to stop working on you,"Even as I type this now, my NumLock light went out again, and yet surprisingly, I can still type (this is not normally the case). I either have to wait a substantial amount of time for the keyboard to start working again, or unplug and plug back in the USB cable in back. Simply out of nowhere, and usually when I am in the middle of typing something, the keyboard will stop working.That set aside, if that doesn't bother you, the touch is a bit different, but I've kinda gotten used to it. I wish the keyboard rested up a bit higher - even with the little ""stands"" pushed up in the back of the keyboard, it seems to rest a little too flat for me. I don't really use the multimedia buttons but I suppose they have their uses."
4,62HMX94,"I've owned this T.V. for 4.5 yrs. I'm on bulb #3,but other than bulb life I'm extremely happy with it.The picture is amazing,especially when connected to my Toshiba Hd DVD player or watching HD programming."
3,Disappointed due to high expectation,".Elenco 500-in-One Elecronic Project LabBeing an electronic engineer myself but having spent most of my working life on supervisory level I thought I could refresh my electronic knowledge and purposefully engage my retirement life. Unfortunatley when I started going through the exercises I soon realised it didnt help you in any way to learn/refresh the theory of electronics. For example the accompanying books dont give: circuit despcription, functions of the components used in a circuit, why a particular value of the component is selected etc. If the ""Lab"" was supplied with a book with the above explanations it would have been of a great value for serious learners as well as for the experienced engineers.Probably Amazon.com could take it up with the ""lab"" manufacturer to bring out a book with the above contents along with it. But if there is already one with such contents could some one advise me of this"
5,Excellent learning tool,"I highly recommend this product to all electronics new comers and even college students will benefit from it. Assembling circuits is easy and lessons are easy to understand. You will develop solid knowledge in analog and digital electronics including microcontrollers. This tool will let you build skills for assembling circuits the correct way, finding errors, keeping components and wires in a proper way (it prevents you from building mess on the workbench). It is definetly worth the money."
3,Review of Electronics 500 in 1 Lab,"I purchased this item to learn more about all Electronic components, even though I had taken several college courses on the subject already. I found some of the instructions to be unclear and seemed to contain diagram errors. I ended up not using this item and reselling it."
5,Lots of fun!,"This toy was a lot of fun for my husband and I. It helps familiarize yourself with engineering concepts and parts, though doens't attempt to explain the math/science behind it. It would be a great toy for kids who like to just explore for the fun of it."
4,Alot of pentials,Great product.Labs are good but should use a more gradual approach.This is a good tools for real life electronic school.
5,A great place to start,"I bought this commentary on a recommendation from C.J. Mahaney video I watched on line. What makes the book worth the money is the introduction. The introduction exposed me to categories and descriptions of these categories that made the book hugely edifying. It's very short, as I believe most commentaries in this series are. You won't get a huge exposition of every word or syntactical expression, rather you'll get the thrust of a passage or section of passages. If you're a laymen (like me) and not a pastor, I would whole-heartedly say start here."
4,What a Cuite,We just got this doll for our daughter's 1st birthday and haven't been able to test it out too much so I feel my review may seem unfair. We have high hopes that Baby Stella will be with us for a long time
4,Adorable Doll,"Adorable little doll. She's soft as can be with adorable facial features and plush outfit. The magnetic pacifier still gets misplaced. But overall, we are happy with this purchase and the quality of the doll. We haven't washed her yet but she looks like she'll take a good washing in the machine."
5,Adorable baby doll,My 19 month old daughter received this doll for Christmas and it was love at first sight. She loves the removable binky and the diaper that she comes with. I love how soft she is and just the right size for little hands. I would buy her again any time.
1,this doll is no longer available,"The doll is adorable right? Well, too bad, you can't have her. They don't make her anymore and if you buy her you will get the regular baby Stella with the pink and lime green outfit with the flower on it and no headband. Yes, the same one you could get for $18 cheaper had you just ordered it in the first place. So if you want the Baby Stella doll, get the cheaper one and it is worth it. Cute doll, very well made, would get alot of love from a little child. Just don't order this one like I did and get ripped off. (Yes, I contacted the company and they refunded some of my money, but they couldn't refund all that shipping I paid). They said they were removing this link so others wouldn't end up in the same boat I did, but so far, they haven't so beware."
2,Mr. Hicks' approach to sizing pipe for compressed air,"Mr. Hicks has done a wonderful job in compling equations, however, he has missed the practical applications in compressed air and vacuum systems. I initially used his theoritcal position on calculating pressure drop in pipe for compressed air. His position seems reasonable and logical until you compare the results with practical applications. Ingresoll-Rand, the air compressor manufacturer, published tables of pressure drop verses pipe sizes, delivery pressures and ACFM. Futher ASPE has published a data book which leads the engineer into an empirical equation for calculating pressure loss in compressed air piping. The results with both Ingresoll-Rand and ASPE agree. Using Mr. Hicks' therotical approach drives the pipe size much larger than needed and therefore the cost of the project. My suggestion is that Mr. Hicks contact I-R and ASPE to incorporate their empirical approach to sizing pipe for compressed air and vacuum systems."
3,This is not the movie I expected,"I saw a motion picture about ""Nuevo Mundo' in the theatre that was about the Spaniards torturing the indigenous people to convert to their form of Christianity. Unfortunately this was not the same movie I saw in the Theatre"
4,Solid Album Straight Through,"I liked the first song so much when I first heard it on XMU that I bought the album the next day. Comparable to the Killers in sound, but less predictable, the hards songs are harder, and the soft songs are less sappy.Highly recommended for almost anyone. Everyone I play it for likes it a lot."
2,No instructions,I couldn't get the stereo to fit in this adaptor. I went to Best Buy and talked to a salesman who knew just what to do. I bought his adaptor and used it instead.
1,These are FREE from the DHHS website!!!,I can't believe people are charging for these!! You can get them FREE from the government website!! This is a real shame!
5,One of the best 60 Minutes stories ever.,"I never miss 60 minutes. it is my favorite show. Week after week they have great stories that keep you fascinated. This one, however, is a real standout. One of my all-time favorites. Well worth the price. Life-changing stuff here."
5,Pistol-grip shiftin'...,"Nobody does it like the Didjits. Nobody can. And I don't care if Offspring attempted to cover ""Killboy Powerhead"" - the original is untouchable. Still, if you like that song, check out the rest of this lyrically tongue-in-cheek, slice-and-dice guitar assault and trust me - it'll make you wanna buy another release by this awesome Chicago trio. These guys should have been more far famous. Trust me - I'm authoring their bio."
5,Hornet Pinata,"The didjits have created the first truly chaotic rock n' roll album of the decade! The album starts it's 100 mph velocity on ""Killboy Powerhead"", a song that was covered by the Offspring on their ""Smash"" album. By the time the album works it's way up to ""Sweet Sweet Satan"", two things are evident: this album is not gonna let up, and singer/guitarist Rick Sims listens to that red dude on his shoulder way, way, too much. Lyrics such as ""excuse me, captain ahab, how did you get me so stoned?"", typify Rick's penchant for all things evil. The album ends with a bass guitar laden cover of Hendrix's ""Foxey Lady"". 'Nuff said."
3,Not for me.,"Emily Mitchell is a world-class harpist, as is evident on this recording. The harp work here is outstanding! The arrangements of the tunes are imaginative and interesting (even if some of the ornamentation isn't quite authentic). The performances are musical and beautifully expressive.However, from a vocal standpoint, this recording is not my cup of tea. She is often under pitch. The vocal production process needs work, and I can't listen to this recording without wanting to ""fix"" her. I will not listen to this again, except as a reference for treatment of individual tunes.So - fine harpist, fine musician, not so great vocalist."
2,What - are you kidding?,"Another trite romance with shallow characters who are all beautiful (with the bluest of eyes), thin, rich and always say the right thing. The descriptions of the countryside and food were very good (thus the extra second star). But the one thing that will stick with me from this novel is the silly description of death ""He had played his last card in the game of life"" pulllleeease. I know this writer can do better!"
2,"Entertaining, but...","I listened to audio CD of this book and thought it was well done. I was appalled, however, by what another reader noted as ""lack of research"". Definitely! Any literate person could find out that rat poison does not kill immediately. It also wouldn't be hard to discover that vets don't go to medical school (guess where they learn their skills- vet school). I know this sounds like whining, but the problem is that these ridiculous mistakes really distract, and therefore detract from your enjoyment of the novel."
2,"Gives new meaning to the term ""French cheese.""","This novel desperately tries to be a suspense/thriller/romance story yet falls desperately short. Its characters are painfully stereotypical (beautiful, tortured, blue-eyed heroine; reticent, tortured, uber-masculine hero) and the story's multiple plot lines are tied up so perfectly that the story surpassed ""sweet"" and plunged headlong into ""treacly"" territory. Character and plot development are tragically lacking, while inane details abound. Why in the world would I care what clothes they wore in every scene?I'm giving it two stars because 1) it obviously wasn't so bad that I stopped reading it and 2) the author's descriptions of foods were very good.This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but it's in the bottom five. The author's writing skills are decent, but she needs to sharpen her focus and be more patient in developing her plots and characters rather than taking the easy way out -- resolving every conflict with three pages of text. Yawn."
4,"Amusing, Descriptive Read","Several Reviewers have given us pretty much the storyline so won't go into all of it. There are some interesting characters as in all Elizabeth Adler books along with some romance and descriptive details of food and clothing. There is a villian, though not exactly what I would call a mystery. I thought the story drug a little from the time Franny meets Jake until they meet again at Rafaella's. I found myself skimming through this part. Once the characters got together, I found more interest in the book. It was fun to have Lola and Jack from Hotel Riviera pay a visit in this book. Invitation to Provence will probably not be listed along with the works of great novelists but it's just a light fun read. Very predictable and very much like some of her other novels. No surprises really! Just a few hours to get away and visit another world and the foods; I've never heard of most of them. However, they make your mouth water. Okay it's not a great book, but it's not bad either."
1,So many errors!,"Others have noted some of the factual errors in this ridiculous book. I will add that it is highly unlikely that a boy raised in Argentina who never went to high school would be admitted to the US Naval Academy and go on to work on nuclear submarines and in military intelligence.Ms Adler also doesn't understand how family relationships work. The daughter of your father's brother is your cousin, not your niece. A child with one Chinese parent and one Caucasian parent cannot possibly have blue eyes. The thing you taste wine with is your ""palate"", not your ""palette"".I was hoping for some dreamy Provencal atmosphere, but this book is a joke. Fortunately, I bought it at a charity thrift store for $1 and will give it back to them."
4,START HERE...,"If you want to discover Sweet,this is the place to start. Right from the begining to the last song this was well placed in a good running order. Any fan would want to alter it slightly but for newbees this was done right. Any real fan is gonna' want all his Sweet albums out anyway. Thats the problem with ""best ofs"" from great bands you will seek out more till you end up with the catalog and you pass this on to a friend.If your on a budget and are curious about the legend you need this now!"
4,I hope you kids get drunk or something,Can you kids dance or are you just gonna stand around and look funny?Check out Mighty High...In Drug City.
3,A new look on the old job hunting books,"This book is a good look from the inside. Many books don't do it, and if they do it's from one source. Here's it's from multiple sources, and by reading it you'll learn a lot."
5,Finally! Juniper Lee!,"Although the other episodes were great, it's cool to finally see Juniper Lee on DVD, even if it is one episode. I recommend this DVD because I am a Juniper Lee fan and the other episodes are great too."
1,received broken and defected,"the box of the CD is broken, i guess it's because no protection in the envelope.moreover, the plastic bag is kind of dirty.doubt this is a new item.not happy at all."
4,The First American Revolution: the American Colonies on the,"Challenging read, but informative. Presents a good overview of the economic relationship between the colonies and England, and how that relationship led to the Revolution. Interesting explaination of the influence of religious beliefs and the growth of religious freedom as a cause of the war. Good introduction to the concept of multiculturalism as it began in colonial America, and very good explanation of the growth of colonial political separation from England prior to the Revolution. One complaint as a teacher - no citations for the many quotations used throughout the book. Credit is given to the individual responsible for the quote, but the actual source of the information is not included."
5,Good for the price,"Although Clinton Rossiter writes in a slightly outmoded style, this is worth having for the price."
1,Very Dissapointed in Quality,"I took me a while to find the cart I wanted for the garden furtilizer, chemicals, and tools. I thought this cart was the answer but I was very wrong.The item was received and very easy to put together. I stocked it with all my garden materials which were well within the weight limits posted.The cart was pushed up against a wall until my next few hours in the yard where I could pull it out and roll it around.This morning, I went out to the garage, and after owning this for two weeks, the cart was tipped on its side, and 3 wheels had broken off. Even thought I was well within weight limits, and the cart was upright the 3 wheels just snapped off, and of course, broke the ""plastic"" and cannot be repaired.While this was supposed to be a rugged heavy duty cart. It certainly is not of the quality that I expected. For $100.00, I expect much more out of a simple wheeled cart."
2,Not very sturdy,"We have purchased 2 of these carts and both have broken at the wheels. When the second one split exactly like the first, we had parts left over to repair it once, but now it had broken again and we have no spare parts. Don't know what the weight limit is on the cart, but we were very conscientious not to overload the second one. It didn't help. All we used the cart for was to move office supplies."
5,16 Years is a Long Time .,"I discovered Francesca Beghe's first album only a few months ago in a sale in a record store in Wellington. This lady has an amazing voice and writes and co-writes her own material. Her first album was a real knockout and contains some wonderful songs. The fact that Dreamworld is only the second album she has released in sixteen years amazes me. This lady has a dream voice and Dreamworld is a great follow up. Dreamworld has lots of great songs on it, but my favourites are Angel Choir, Requiem and Little One. Let's hope that another album is on the way soon. Francesca deserves a much wider audience, hope she makes it down to New Zealand sometime in the future !!!"
3,Accessories Included,"Arrived assembled, no dings or scratches. I didn't see in the ad and was very happy to get a good case, a sharpening tool, chain oil, mix oil, and of course the chainsaw adjusting tool. Like the Poulan trimmer I ordered the same day, the saw started easily and went straight to work. I don't know about long-term yet but initial quality is above and beyond.Now I know the longer term and my review went from 5 to 2 stars. The idle went to crap before I used one bottle of chain oil. Won't run unless ""floored.""Now, longer term the idle is better, still never runs smoothly, a lot of restarting going on. Thank you for the input, but I didn't run it floored and burn it out. It started doing it after about 10 minutes of gentle use. The floored come in when it quit running."
2,Not my favorite chain saw,"When new, this chain saw is hard to start. Yes, you follow the instructions precisely and it works. But it is still hard to start, compared to the half dozen other saws I have owned. Worse, if you let the saw sit for a few months (which is common for me), then it is so gummed up that it must be dismantled and lubricated before you can start it again. Contrast this to another similar saw I have, which sat for more than a year and started immediately.That said, the saw works well and has plenty of power. Hard to adjust correctly though, it does not idle very well (even when new). I had to adjust the idle speed high enough that the chain was spinning, to keep it from dying. That problem went away after 6-8 hours of use.It is an acceptable saw, barely, but I would not purchase it again."
4,Poulan 16-inch chainsaw does the job,"Prior to purchasing this saw I read all of the negative reviews which seemed to focus on problems starting the engine. I decided to take a shot, and although the saw was difficult to start, I was able to get it started each time I needed to use the saw. On one particular occasion, the saw was impossible to start until I reset the chain brake, and ""voila"", it turned over immediately. I wonder if this relatively simple fix, is something that has plagued others.Most importantly, the saw kept up with my buddies 16-inch Stihl, as I took down several trees in my yard. For the homeowner who needs an occasional chainsaw, this baby does the trick. I deducted one star, because it is not the easiest machine to start."
4,Poulan Pro PP3416 Chain Saw,"This is a great little saw for the homeowner. It's got adequate power and bar size for all but the largest jobs. I had an ancient one of these that I have used for several years (I got it for free) but finally decided to replace it with a new one and I'm very pleased with this one. It started and ran right out of the box, though I did have to increase the idle slightly (a very minor adjustment) to keep it from dying when the throttle was released. Overall, it seems sturdy and dependable, works great!"
4,For want of a gas cap,"I'm not too experienced with chain saws. This one performs well if not a little heavy for extended use. But it does have one huge flaw which I credit to bad engineering. The gasoline cap which is male is supposed to fit into female threads that are part of the saw body. Problem is the plastic gas cap swells and it takes channel lock pliers to remove it and you can't replace it. Poulan customer service says and I quote ""Put the cap in the sun for 2 hours."" Bull! I can put it in the freezer for a couple of hours and the cap struggles back into place. But that means my chain saw is good for one tank of gas, then a long break.Poulan ought to supply each new saw with multiple gas caps so the saw can operate for more than a tank of gas."
1,"FROZE UP, WASTE OF $$$","I didn't buy mine from Amazon (got it from Menards) but I looked around and didn't see any reviews of these chainsaws and had to post my disgust somewhere.DON'T BUY THIS DISPOSABLE PIECE OF CRAP.I used the oil that came in the box. Mixed it with a gallon of gas. After using it for ~2 hours, it froze up. Not covered by warranty. I'm just out the money.Why put oil in the fracking box if it's not enough to keep it from seizing up?The repair place I called said this happens allll the time with these Poulan saws. They have a typical life of 20 HOURS!!!!!!!!!!! Unreal.Spend the extra $30 and get a Stihl."
3,Cuts well but not very user friendly,"This is a very nice chainsaw and it is a good value but I had several problems with it upon receiving it. First, I wasn't able to get it started. I followed the instructions and tried dozens of times to get it started. I even had a neighbor who used to use chainsaws for a living try to start it and it wouldn't start. I then sent it to the warranty place. A week later they called me to tell me they had no trouble starting it. I has to pay $30 for that diagnosis. When I was finally able to get it started on my own, it worked great. The other complaint I have is that tightening the chain is a very cumbersome process."
1,0 stars if i could.,"First let me say i have experience with chainsaws.Second, this saw was about as bad as they come. Following the instructions, i got it cranked up and running very easily. Started pruning some trees, and about 5 cuts later it stalled out on me after a cut. It struggled to crank after its initial stall. Several times the pull cord would get stuck and i would have to disassemble to get it to function again. Eventually i noticed the chain would not move on the bar, even though it was relatively loose. The chain brake had been disengaged and still it wouldn't budge. The pull start was very rough and still couldn't get the chain to budge even after removing the bar and chain. My guess is either the engine had seized or the chain brake was stuck on. Either way i was done with it. Hopefully i just got a lemon.Amazon's customer service took care of me perfectly, but i will be replacing it with a higher quality saw."
4,good back up saw,"saw works fine,easy start,light weight.bar oil reservoir leaks at the cap oring all in all,good occasional use saw.Could use bucking teeth."
4,Nice little saw,"Nice little saw for the price. Easy to handle and use. Great for general home and yard use. Not a good choice for the big jobs, but very useful for general casual use by the average homeowner. Was a bit hard to get started the very first time, but after that there didn't seem to be much problem. Have used various chain saws over the last forty years from Alaska to Puerto Rico and this one does the job I bought it for. If you want to do some serious cutting, look for something bigger. Otherwise, you'll probably be satisfied with one of these."
5,Praise for Poulan chain saw,"Still own one of these saws, bought back when it was called a ""Woodsman"", nearly ten years ago. Have cut I don't know how many large trees down (some I had to walk around with it) since we moved to the country, and had many Live Oaks that developed oak wilt. Not light duty work, I've worked the heck out of it, cutting those large trees all the way to firewood. Still running, still strong. Have replaced the bar twice, the chain three times. Used it yesterday and it was leaking chain oil. Took it apart and cleaned it, think I fixed it. Will find out later today. If I didn't, I'm glad to find that I can buy another one like it right here on Amazon.Wouldn't consider buying another brand, after the success I've had with this one."
1,Save Your $ and Your Arm,"My MAC3200 gave up the ghost after 17 faithful years. This Poulan brought back all the nightmares from 1994 ... I had had a Poulan before tossing it for the MAC.Plain and simple ... Poulans do not start or, if you're lucky to get it started after hours of pulling your arm out, it doesn't stay running. I have no idea why a MAC can start on the second pull every time year-after-year, but these POS can't. And why McCulloch goes under and Poulan doesn't. Who makes their small engines anyway?Call to Poulan [number in instructions] ... => they said, ""can't use ethanol-blend gasoline"". I told them ""that's all you can get in VA, the 10% ethanol blend"". They say ""sorry, you're screwed Charlie"".Since I can't return [one reason for NEVER buying a non-returnable item from AMAZON, I decided to donate to Goodwill and buy the McCulloch at my local Home Depot.]Unless you can afford a Stihl, go with an electric."
3,Saw without a Case,"Saw is OK, I'll have to see how it works over the long haul.The ad said a case was included, but no case arrived.I sent an email to Amazon, but have yet to get a reply over a week later ?"
1,After lengthy launch sequence start = FAIL,"Ok, so I just bought this chainsaw to take care of a pretty massive limb that fell in my yard. I read the instructions, mixed the oil with the gas, and readied myself for the lengthy launch sequence. Everything seemed to be going well, the launch sequenced appeared to work and the saw started, for 10 seconds. Then it stopped and it will not re-start. I waited an hour, went through the launch sequence again and nothing. Failed to start. I'll try again in another hour, if it's not raining. But for now a big fat 1 star. I'd give it 0 stars if I could."
4,this is more like it,"I was not a big fan of Horse Stories, the album which preceeds Ocean Songs, but this one won me over. It seems more focused to me; the mood is consistent throughout. Slow and somber, never really finding a downbeat most of the time. But the boys have a strange telepathy going on, and it shines through on most tracks. Warren Ellis' intonation has improved since Horse Stories; he prefers a lower range here, which makes up for the lack of a bassist. And once again, Steve Albini seems to be the perfect engineer, placing the group in a isolated, yet ambient space. The dynamics are more apparent, and it helps. This album is great for a long night-drive, relaxing, thinking, and many other moods. Kind of like what Erik Satie called ""furniture music;"" it's there for you to listen to or have in the background. As far as the whole Dirty Three catalog goes, this is the essential package."
5,Recovery at Sea,"A wonderful album. I'd never heard the Dirty Three before, now I'm wondering where I've been all these years. If you've ever been in the middle of nowhere in a crowd of people, in the middle of the night, in the wilderness of your mind, or alone in a sea of conformity, this album's for you. Ocean Songs is ultimate alienation, despair, hope-- all drifting, of a piece. The sound of the group is impressive in itself, the textures, tones, spacing, hollow yet full-bodied, symphonic yet intimate, close and far away, all mixed to perpetual, aural aching. The album is blue and bright, and might change your life."
3,good music; unfortunate mixing,"A violin, a guitar and drums meet, then swim about together in dreamy, liquid compositions. The music is fine, but the mixing makes it hard to really let it wash over you. The drums are miked too close while the violin is placed too far back. Rather than smooth violin work supported by twangy guitar and punctuated by percussion, we feel the tension of a misplaced element that throws the balance off. And here, balance is critical."
2,awesome background sounds,"It really is quite nice listening if you're sad or doing something else, but I feel misled by Amazon's review, which suggested that it ""bristle[s] with electricity,"" and that ""underneath there is a rock band--a dangerous, fire-breathing bunch with lust in their hearts and murder in their eyes."" I heard none of this."
2,cute but it tears,"Like the other reviewers, my sheet tore the first time I put it on my daughter's crib. However, I really like the flower design, so I am going to keep it. It looks great in her nursery."
1,new mom,"I bought the 6 piece crib set, which includes this sheet. I washed it before putting it on the mattress (as recommended) and it shrunk and then tore when I tried to get it on the mattress. I took the whole set back and now I'm looking for a higher quality alternative. I was very disappointed, especially considering the price of the set."
5,Jenifer the new french star !!!,"It's the first album of Jenifer Bartoli a new french singer...from ""Star Academy""...she's a very popular singer in France, Belgium,...The songs are beautiful, the voice of Jenifer is sweet and pure, she's 19, so she's very young, and her songs talk about...love, simply !Its a ""fresh"" album, a pop album...She isn't a new Britney Spears, she's better than Britney !!!I've got this album and I listen it everyday !!!(PS : Sorry fr my english, I speak french, so...)"
2,Quite dull,"I bought this CD from amazon.uk, and was pretty dissapointed. The tracks were very similar; they were all rather boring ballads, or middle-of-the-road pop- Céline Dion style to be honest. If you are a Céline fan then you might like this- slow songs, with an under-produced, quiet sound. If however, you are more into Lorie or Alizée do not get this."
5,Muy buena calidad,"Es un disco bien realizado, los temas tienen buena calidad y la intérprete exhibe buenas cualidades. Los trece temas del CD son agradables y junto con el álbum vienen las letras de las canciones, lo cual es de mucha ayuda para quienes no dominamos el francés."
4,As a reference,"This text is really great, once you know the material. It's a bit hard to learn from, but it has so much knowledge in it for people to look up. It requires a fairly sophisticated background, and I started using it after going through the first half of Hatcher, but found it friendly after getting the basics of each section down. It is one of those books that is hard to get through on the first run through, but amazing to keep and use later. It does a good job leading someone to how the Poincare duality works and what is actually going on, and starts someone on intersection theory quite welcomingly.The star off, however, is for the outrageous cost. It is a book you'll want to keep, though."
2,Lightweight and overpriced,"I had to study this for my degree. It was one of those books that one person bought and was passed around mainly due to it's outrageous cost. It has a lack of rigour that is not made up by being more intuitive or giving the reader insight into why differential topology is such a great subject.Transversality is rightly given prominence, but you don't really walk away with a good feel for it's importance or power. Degrees, linking numbers etc I got for 10 GBP with Milnor's Topology from a Differential Point of View.As an introduction to differential topology - with a little point set and alot of algebraic throw in - Bredon's Geometry and Topology sets the gold standard, with Darling's Differential Forms and Connections doing a good job on the differential geometry front and Milnor's book above providing bedtime reading beforehand. You can buy all three together for around the same price as this book."
1,DON'T BUY THIS EDITION: Very poor printing,"I loved to study this book several years ago as an undegraduate. Now I have to teach those subjects, so I decided to buy a copy for myself. I received the book, admired the beautiful hardcover, but when I opened it I was immediately shocked by the crude quality of the printing. The problem is that this is a poorly scanned version of the old edition (which I took from the library to compare). I fear I'll be dizzy if I start reading this; I guess that if I try to scan a page of the original with my home scanner and print it on a laser printer I'll get a better result. I'm very surprised that AMS published this. Now, for the first time in many years as a costumer, I'll try to return this book to Amazon.PS: Another reviewer (Lucius Schoenbaum) had similar complaints as me, but for some reason he gave a 5 star rating. My single star refers not to the text itself, but to the quality of this printing and to the value of the purchase."
5,Durable!!,"Got this for my 11 year old for Christmas. He loved it, jumped on it first thing on Christmas morning. Vinyl is durable,not cheap and thin like some bean bags. He has now had it for a year and he and his brother are always dragging it around and jumping on it from the couch and it still hasn't ripped!! Great chair!!"
3,Silent movie from 1927,"What can be said about a really lame silent movie from 1927? It is extremely dark and difficult to see, but considering the age... LOL! Its worth watching just for a good laugh!"
1,Nearly unwatchable,"I managed to get through the movie but it took an effort. The Photoplay Restoration was so heavily fuscia tinted it was almost imposible to make out what was going on. Very little was discernible in dark areas of the screen while the highlighted areas, such as the actors faces, were a sickly green tinged with fuscia. It would have been a much better in black and white. I have vhs and LaserDisc copies of movies which predate this one (Napoleon andLon Chaney, Sr.'s Phantom of the Opera, to name 2) which are much more viewable than this dvd. I won't be watching this one a second time."
5,THIS HAD TO BE THE MODEL FOR ALL HAUNTED HOUSE MOVIES TO COME!,"I wonder if Julia Stiles ever saw this movie? The movie's heroine looks so much like her.....shorter maybe.....but definitely looks enough like Julia to be a relative.A great haunted house movie. No doubt scared the socks off viewers back in the day. Much of the ""scares"" have been seen time and again in various haunted house movies since....but just imagine THIS was the original.Of course, there's the obligatory twist at the end. Fun to watch and of excellent quality too."
5,Great for little minds.,My grandson has really enjoyed this project. Very good science lesson for 8 year old. It was worth the money.
5,Loved by both the young and old,"My 7 year old son and 75 year old grandfather have played with the circuits non-stop since Christmas. I am not sure who loves it more! The product is made of high quality material, not cheap plastic that is easily broken. There are more than 100 different activities to make complete circuits in this set."
3,Met Expectations.,"5-yr. old may be a little young. Still loves his legos, and this toy has some of those characteristics, so thought it would intrigue. Did for a short time, but child had higher expectations on what it did for his work. Loved the visual results more than the audible."
4,"Nice product, nice company.",Picked this up for boys (5 and 7) last year. They have played with it off and on for a year. One of the sound chips failed and Elenco was very good about replacing it (check their website for replacements or ordering additional parts). We picked up theElenco Snap Circuits UC-30 Upgrade Kit SC-100 to SC-300for Christmas this year.
5,An instant favorite like Legos,This is an instant favorite like Legos for our 5 year old son who is inclined to building/engineering. He is going through the book and making a bunch of cool stuff to see what light/sound/effect he can create if he gets it correct. There has not been any toy other than legos that has captured attention and motivated USE OF TOY (instead of having it sit on the shelf) as much as this one.
5,Great educational toy and great foundation to teach electronic basics from,I remeber seeing a similar toy made by Radio Shack years ago. It allows the child to learn the basic concepts of circuits and switches while at the same time being stimulating. It is money well spent. I highly recommend this product.
5,Snap Circuits Jr.,This was a gift for our 6 year old grandson for Christmas and he played nonstop for hours! By following the directions himself he was able to build a number of projects shown as well as come up with a few of his own. He was still building new projects from the instruction manual when we left 5 days later. I can not say enough positive things about this toy. It is very well built and will give hours of entertainment! I would highly recommend this toy to a child who likes to build and create.
5,Best Toy Ever,"We bought this toy for our 8 yr old son, and he loves it. Plays for ever with it. The book that comes with it is do easy for him to understand and all 101 ways are in that book. He hardly ever asks for help. When he plays with it it helps him with concentration and following directions. I would advise that this is a great gift. My son will play with it and forget about his video games."
5,David M,This is an excellent kit. My 6 and 7 year olds will sit and play with it for hours. It only took them two or three projects before they were making their own without the manual. I highly recommend it.
2,No Manual,"I purchased this for 9 year old nephew for Christmas. He opened on xmas day and wanted to play with it. To my suprise, the boax lacked anything about the contents. A co-worker's child received it for the holiday and the child loved. I do recall that child following some sort of manual to do projects with it. Disappointment Christmas present."
3,Should be more educational,"I wanted to love this. I don't. While the toy comes with a book of instructions for how to create very specific tricks, what it lacks is the ""why""...why does it light up when you connect those wires? Why doesn't the sound play if you use a different piece? This toy would be greatly improved if the co. provided a small book on how electronics work in general. I wanted my daughter to learn a bit about electricity and conduction and she's really only following very specific instructions and we have no clue for why different arrangements don't work. Eh. Could be better but more educational than Candyland."
5,Snap Circuits Rocks!,"My wife and I bought Snap Circuits Junior for my son on his eighth birthday and it is his favorite present, by far. The pieces are made of a very durable plastic (with a metal band running along the underside) and are easy to put together using simple metal snaps. It's powered by two AA batteries.He's already learned how to build circuits in line and series. He's been able to build his own version of a flashlight. He's hooked up the electric motor (it comes in the kit) and built the helicopter toy and made his own fan. He's already asking for the add-on kits for Christmas. When I consider all the toys that I've bought my son over the last several years, this has got to be the best value that I've found in terms of the fun and educational value for the money. I highly recommend this kit."
5,Durable learning tool,"We bought this for my 10 year old son after reading the other reviews on the product. He played with it for hours and was totally excited over his creations. His younger sisters, 8 and 5, also had a good time playing with the kit. My kids are hard on their toys, & after months of play the pieces are still in tact. Highly recommend this for your budding scientist or for anyone looking for something for that 'difficult to buy for' little boy or girl."
5,Great toy!,"I bought this set for my son's 8th birthday. It was definitely his favorite present. 4 months later my kids 8, 6, and 3 still love it! When they get it out they play with it for hours and get upset when I tell them it's time to put it away. My kids haven't ever needed help from me to do any of it so that's nice too, that I don't have to be right there like with many scientific play sets."
5,Great toy!,My son is 6 and he's able to build simple projects. It is really a user-friendly and hassle free toy. I'm totally satisfied.
5,Quality Time With Your Child,"I bought the Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100 for my grandson's 6th birthday. The box says it's for ages 8 to 108; however, it is totally appropriate and safe for children a little younger."
5,GFamily Fun,My husband and daughter love playing together with this set They work together to complete the projects and both of them get something out of the experience.
5,Handy for many applications,I bought these for my grandsons but the whole family utilizes them. Check out the options on Amazon.com for the best selection and great prices.
5,Great educational toy for creative kids,Gave this to my 6 year old grandson who is really into Legos. Since he can build them form the picture instructions I thought he could doe these electrical projects. He really seem to enjoy this toy as does his 9 year old sister. Even seems to be some competition over who gets to play with it.Would be nice if there were a few extra switches and lights in the package.
4,Good to great.,"It was just what my grandson wanted so I liked it too. If a kid is happy, his grandma is happy too."
5,amazing,"My kids love this and spend so much time playing with this and making different things, the only problem we have run into is that they both want to use it at the same time... Maybe another small set at a later time??? :-)"
5,Using for special ed students - they love it.,"I teach in a school for students with severe learning disabilities. I used these kits with students from 11-18 years old, both boys and girls, and they all love it. They take care of the kits, follow directions, and work in groups. Three things I thought I'd never see in my classroom. The only change I would have made is that instead of buying the Sc-100s from an educational supply store I could have gotten the SC-300 kit for the same price from Amazon.This is a great educational toy. One of the best I've ever seen and it requires minimal adult supervision."
5,This Product was Perfect!,"I purchased Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100 for my children to use as part of our home education. My daughter is 8 and my son is 5. I questioned saving it for later years since my son is only 5 but got it out on a snowed in day. This was perfect! Not only is it educational but it is something that you can use over and over and not get bored. Once I showed my kids how to do two of them with my help - they were off and making the next project and the next all on their own. My 8 year old read the information, my 5 year old followed the picture to make it work.I recommend this product to everyone now and we will be purchasing more! It has been a few weeks and it still comes out daily!"
4,Electronics for kids,"The Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100 is a good way for kids (seven-nine years old) to have fun while learning the basics of electrical circuits. Two of my grandchildren have it (both boys), and really like it. It is mechanically sturdy, requires no tools (parts snap together), is safe (uses only AA cells), and the pictorial instructions for various projects are easily understood by kids of the appropriate age. When the kids use up all the projects in the book, they readily think up variations of their own. The only reason for not giving it five stars is that there is no explaination given for how the logic circuit works, so it remains a mystery for the kids."
5,Wonderful and Educational!,"I bought this for my 5-year-old son last year! It reminded me of the little radio/light kit my brother had when I was a kid- except you won't get shocked on this one! This was a little overwhelming for my son at first, but it did not take long for him to get the hang of it. With a little reading assistance on very simple directions, he was on his way to building and snapping everything in place. Everything is numbered and there is a diagram for almost everything. He is now 6 and can do it almost completely on his own. I fully intend to continue buying bigger sets as he grows older. This is a Wonderful product!"
5,Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100,"Great product, my son loves it (7 years old). You can make all kinds of neat things, electricity, make things move, it's just good fun and hours of entertainment!"
4,Very Cool,"Not a huge amount of replay interest, but still a good couple of hours of fun here and there."
3,"OK, Not sure it teaches much circuit theory","Its easy to follow the directions and build projects, but does not teach enough for a kid to build a project on is own. Its a little too 'black box' I liked the old school radio shack kits that used real components."
5,Great Gift-everyone loves this.,My daughter has this and we buy it for the kids who visit and can't stop playing with it. Great gift.
4,Great for kids interested in electronics.,Got this for my Grandson and he likes it a lot. It seems to be a really good educational toy.
5,Great Set for Teaching About Electric Circuits,Our 4 1/2 year old grandson can build his own cirucits with this set. He enjoys discussions about electricity and now he can create his own power.
5,Snap Circuits,I have used this product several times in the classroom with elementary and middle school aged children. The response was overwhelmingly positive. The schools we partner with for science demonstrations liked these kits so much they jumped at the chance to get some as a donation. The diagrams are easy to follow. Basic electrical concepts are easy to teach. Kids readily start designing their own circuits. I recommend these kits to anyone who has children interested in hands on experiments.
5,"Fun, yet educational","We bought this for our 9 year old nephew for Christmas. He already has more toys and stuff than he knows, so we wanted to get him something different. He loves it, and it's something he can work on without little brother (3 years old). He started going through the list of projects with my help the day we gave it to him. A few days later he was already into the 20's.The manual also gives a brief explanation of how the experiments work, which is nice, and will be something he can understand more once he's a little older."
5,My 5-year-old son's favorite toy!,"This is by far my son's favorite toy. He spends hours playing with it and does not need any assistance. Before he got the snap circuits, he was tying my cabinet knobs together with pipe cleaners and rubber bands. I'm so glad he now enjoys focusing on something more educational! The diagrams are very easy for him to follow. He's had it three months now and still has all of the pieces. It comes in a great box with a spot for each piece so if one is missing you'll know which one. He recently broke a little piece off the motor and squished the light bulb (his fault) but he can still make lots of experiments. For Christmas we ordered him the largest set of snap circuits."
5,My grandson loves this,My grandson loves this toy. He's 13 and has carried it along with him to several relative's homes so he can show them how it works.
5,The best toy purchase I've made,"This is quite possibly the best toy purchase I've bought for my science loving six year old! The diagrams are easy to follow and the pieces are clearly labeled and easy to snap in place. After just one or two projects with direction, my son was able to follow the directions and complete the projects on his own. A big thank you from a a grateful mom of an easily frustrated 6yr old who rarely entertains himself!!"
5,Awesome Toy,This an awesome toy! My 6 & 1/2 yr old son loves this toy. He keeps playing with it and making new combinations. This is his favorite Christmas gift. Educational and fun! I can't wait to buy him more sets like this from same company! Highly recommend this toy!!!
5,Amazin,"I bought Snap Circuit Jr for my almost 5 year old child who is curious abd loves building. It took him very little before falling in love with it. He started building projects immediately and soon he tried to make experiments by himself thinking out of the directions. He was so excited abot his discoveries and the possibility of realizing also the more advanced projects all by himself. I think that this toy really give children the possibility of understanding the basic of electronics in a easy and plyful way. The concept is not very different for the Lego one and the project instructions are very easy to be followed also by young children provided that they are able to recognise letters and numbers. The results are highly rewarding for the kids and therefore, they learn a lot playing with the toy. I will highly recommend this toy and I will buy it as a gift. I think that I will soon upgrade to next level."
3,"Not bad, not very educational.","I don't think this item is really intended to teach electronics. I didn't think it was when ordering it, so I'm not disappointed.It more teaches the fact that there are electonic components, and they all have a job, and when you put them together right you can make some fun things. There are simplified components like the 'Alarm' component, which give no real understanding of what it is (I guess some sort of basic oscillator circut). The project themselves have 'objectives' but they are sort of silly, like 'What happens when we hook a light to a battery?'.It's simple so little kids can follow the projects, and it does teach some very basic concepts of electronics. But I would compare it to a Lego set teaching architecture. Don't expect anyone to walk away with a degree, and you can have fun."
5,Perfect christmas gift!,"Purchased for my 7 year old son for christmas. When he first saw it wasn't as thrilled as I had hoped, but he and my husband and I have spent this whole evening putting projects together and he is dying to work his way through the whole book!Instructions are clear and easy to understand (there are even arrows on the components that are directional). If he makes it through the book we are planning to get him the BIG set for his birthday!Update:Once we got into building some of the projects, we realized that one of our components was defective, contacted customer service thru their website, and got new parts in the mail the next day! very friendly and helpful."
5,The perfect gift for an intelligent child,I like the concept of an interactive toy that teaches a child the principles of electrical connectivity while they play.In an era where the most popular toys/children's games focus on virtual scenarios this toy encourages children to physically build a multitude of electric circuits.I bought this toy as a birthday gift for a multi-lingual 11 year old who is not a native English speaker. It was a huge success.
5,6 year old son loves it.,"My 6 year old who loves LEGO really enjoyed his ""Science"". The instructions are well laid out. The quality of the parts are good."
2,Did Not Come With All The Pieces,"This looks like it would be a great toy/experiment/learning tool except for the fact that it only came with a few pieces. The package it was delivered in was a little beat up but looked sealed. When we opened it, the box was not sealed and had a rubber band holding the lid on. We received this as a gift for one of my children. The purchaser felt badly and contacted the seller. The seller blamed the missing parts on the shipper and we have not heard back from them yet about a refund or a replacement kit. If you purchase this product, don't buy it from ""Sold by Renaissance Buttons Inc. (thenextpagebooks)"""
5,Brilliant,"One of the best toys ever. My 6 and 3 year olds are mesmerized. Mind you, my husband is an award winning professor, so patience and explanation are key."
4,My 8 yr old loves it!,"I found this on a website titled ""Best toys for 8 yr olds"" and I thought it sounded like a good idea. My son has used it for a few weeks off and on and he loves it. He accomplished a number of the projects and still keeps trying. It is very entertaining. I think over time the ""Science"" of it will sink in for him."
5,Awesome toy,Heard from others that this circut set is so great so I got one for my nephew for Christmas-- they love it.
5,my 8 and 5 year olds love it,it is durable and the 5 year old loves it too. like the guide showing where to put components back.
5,must have!!!,This is a very fun and educational product. Full of great experiments for all ages. I had fun playing with it and so did the kids. I purchased it for our electricity Homeschool science unit. The circuit board itself might not stand up to rough play. It is a snap like jacket snaps but under supervision and care it would he fine.
4,It is great,My son used this in school and it is so good he wanted it himself. It is easy to use and an educational tool that the kids love.
2,"Shoddy quality trumps ""should be cool""","I REALLY wanted this to be a good product. The concept is fantastic. The parts are all very manageable by my 4 year old. Unfortunately three of the key parts don't work DOA. That is about half of the important components. A large number of projects cannot be performed without these pieces. Quite disappointed.I haven't contacted the vendor yet, but I'm hoping that they will replace the parts."
4,Interesting for my 8 year old daughter,I thought my kids would be more intriuged by this but so far they have shown a mild interest in putting together the circuits. I think this will be a big hit eventually but right now they have only played with it 2 or 3 times since receiving it for Christmas.
1,Would be more fun if it worked,"There was a problem with the motor. The motor circuit was opening depending on the rotor position. It would spin and then stopped. Great idea and very well intentioned; but it failed to function as planned. Got a refund. Fortunately, Santa had many more presents."
5,Best Gift this Year!,"My 5 1/2 year old just got this kit for Christmas and LOVES LOVES LOVES it. It's very uncomplicated looking, has a great easy to follow & read manual showing all 100 activities and does some fun stuff. What a great toy and learning activity."
5,Excellent!! Beat out video games!!,I bought this on a whim for my 8 year old daughter for Chrismukkah (Hanukkah and Christmas). She never knew it existed. I thought she might have fun with it. Well this is her favorite toy she received this year! She received new games for her DS and other toys that she has been begging us for but she has played with this all morning and does not want to put it away. I am already researching buying the next set in the line. I highly recommend this. It is also allot of fun for 41 year old kids as well!!
4,12 y/o boy review,"We got this for our 12 y/o boy (a hard to buy for age). He really likes putting together the different configurations and experiments and will bring them to us, ""Hey, look what I made this time!"" Great for rainy days, keeps him busy and interested for several hours at a time! I recommend this for that hard to buy for tween age!"
5,Perfect gift for elementary school kids!,my second grader son just loves it.he has learned basic of physics without even realizing and while having fun !!
5,Favorite in our house and for bday party gifts,"A friend gave this to my son for his 4th birthday and we've bought it for a few friends now too. Endless hours of fun and educational, creative play. It is essentially electric Legos and reminds me of science projects we did in middle school but much easier for a preschooler or older to do on their own. Super fun and great toy."
4,Snap Circuits Jr.,I bought this for my 6 yr. old nephew and it was a hit. He really has enjoyed trying the different designs and making them work.
5,The Trail Less Traveled,Anyone that lives on a farm will love the words to this music. It doesn't hurt any that the music also has the right rhythm for farm life. The songs describe farm life and it is the road less traveled now days. You have a better quality of life and learn responsibilities that you would never have learned otherwise. This CD reflects it perfectly.
5,moving lyrics,An other great and moving album by Mary Ann Kennedy. Only people who have experienced deep relationships with horses (and other animal friend) can appreciate the depth of these lyrics and this music. Heart felt and so typical.
4,Ms. Nosey loves Mr. Nosey,"These ""Mr."" and ""Little Miss"" books have delighted me ever since I read them to my kids. Written more to be read aloud, they are perfect for 4- to 9-year-olds with a sense of humor. You can almost hear the author smile as the words prod you to turn to the next page. Of course, the story line is completely silly (long-nosed man gets his nose painted, pinched, etc., by his neighbors to help cure his nosiness), but kids seem to love seeing these goofy people learn, through much slapstick, how to tame their excessive behavior. I only wish the female books were ""Ms. This"" and ""Miss That"" instead of ""Little Miss."" But that's just a wish from Big Ms. Feminist."
4,"Very thorough, a little dated","The book gave a good overview from start to finish and enough detail to feel like you've learned something. I just wish there were an updated edition only because there are so many pageants now and competition among them. Not to mention legal issues and intimidation by bigger pageants (think loud,rich guy with bad hair), I wish I was kidding.I'd definitely rec commend this if you are producing or thinking of producing a pageant."
5,Extremely Good Hardcore Punk Album,"Rise Against proved themselves to be a worthy new name in the hardcore sub-genre of punk with the release of their first album, The Unraveling. It was quite decent, filled with energy and force. However, their sophomore record is far superior, in my opinion. Here, their music is melodic, anthemic, heartfelt and powerful all at the same time. Who would've thought mere rookies could emerge with such raw emotion by just their second album? The lyrics and subject matter strike dangerously close to home, mostly concerning the aftermath of 9/11. Often times, the energy presented here will make more mainstream political punk bands (Pennywise, Anti-Flag) appear as child's play, by comparison. Though less fast-paced than their previous album, this one has better songwriting and a more polished feel.Certainly worth picking up. I'd give it four and a half stars if I could, but I usually round up on Amazon.com."
4,By Far Their Best Album,"This album exceeds all expectations of a sophomore success story. Their first album ""The Unraveling"" sets the tone for their much anticipated future. ""Revolutions Per Minute"" starts off with a bang and does not slow down. It also ends with a cover of ""Anyway You Want It."" This is Rise Against's best album to date and I only expect better from them in the future. For those of you who don't quite know who they are, they are more of a politically driven band, but not as extreme as Pennywise or Bad Religion. Overall, Rise Against is an awesome mixture of punk, hard rock, and pop sounding punk. I recommend this album to the fullest."
5,Mindblowingly good music,"This is Rise Against's second album and far more polished and focused than their debut album ""The Unraveling"". The melodies and the hooks flow very well and the album fits together nicely. Most of the songs are hard and fast, though they do show they can mix it up a bit with ""Like the Angel"". ""Amber Changing"" and ""Last Chance Blueprint"" are the two best songs on the CD for me and two of the best rock songs I've heard in my life. Even if you don't buy the album, I consider these two tracks ""must haves"" for any punk/hard rock lover.A couple of the weaker songs here could be dinged for too much yelling and not enough melody. ""Dead Ringer"" comes to mind. Aside from that the album is a masterpiece and easily one of Rise Against's best albums. Definitely worth the money."
