4,Brutally heavy death metal.,"This album shreds! Sounding like a mix between Dying Fetus and Cannibal Corpse, Severe Torture leave very little to be wanted. With intense drumming, excellent vocals and a very original style of death metal. I suspect these guys are going to be very big in the underground scene within the next two albums they release. I recommend this album HIGHLY to anyone who enjoys the faster and more blasty style of death metal. Definately at least worth a listen, whether you like that style or not...very very original band."
2,Not too great.,"I agree with ""Burning Babies"". The instrumentals weren't that great...and the overall sound lacks (not to mention the fact that the whole CD seems as if it's one giant, similar-sounding song). The vocals are actually, in my opinion, pretty well executed though. They remind me of Chris Barnes except a bit higher in pitch and fuller, so to speak. Still, the CD generally lacks. It sounds similar to Misanthropic Carnage also, but I'd say Misanthropic Carnage is better than this LP. It has more variation and technicality to it than this one.So, if you're into standard, semi-boring grindcore-ish death metal then this release is for you. If you're more into technical death metal and standard non-grindcore-like death metal vocals with a substantial amount of variation among songs, then I wouldn't suggest this to you."
5,Very satanic band with rythm to their music.,"Severe torture's ""feasting on blood"" is very much an albumthat is quite assential and has its own brutality to it without being overly done like so many crap out now... For people into a sound thats originaly again and has not cheesy satanic lirycs? Get it."
3,Meh.....,"Fairly technical, competently performed, but uninspired. Standard death metal fare with lots of trem picking, blast beats, and some pretty cool breakdowns (probably the highlights of the album). Overall, there's not much here to differentiate it from the pack however. The unintelligible (even for death metal) vocals remind me of Chris Barns or John Gallagher and add little to the experience, and the riffing is generally pedestrian. Perhaps worth having if you are a rabid death metal fan, but otherwise, skip it. There are just too many bands who can pull this off with far more originality and skill (e.g. Suffocation, Deicide, Nile, Cryptopsy, ____ insert favorite death band here). Three stars is generous."
5,Most authoritative single book in the World in the subject!,The most extensive coverage of media and subject matter for usein creating science art. For use by practicing illustrators.
4,Good for a companion bag,"I have the Skip Hop duo and bought this for extra long day trips for some extra storage. It is very small and doesn't fit a lot, but perfect as a companion bag. I have twins, and this fits 2 sippy's and plenty of snacks for the day. This leaves plenty of room in the regular diaper bag for everything else>"
5,cute and handy,"I got two of this bag for my 2-year-old and 4-year-old boys. Since they are older, I don't need to carry too many things anymore. This bag is just the right size. Love it!!"
3,okay,This was well-made and as advertised but a bit smaller than I had really expected. You should also note that you can't fold the stroller with this attached although the size is perfect for the Maclaren strollers.
5,Perfect with Chicco Liteway,"I love the Chicco Liteway but we know with all umbrella strollers, there is limited basket space. This fits my needs perfect for the day at the zoo or any other trip that will last about half a day. The bag is small as other post have said but it fit a lot!I have the following in my bag:Front zipper pocket: Child size spoon and fork, 4 wet ones singles, kleenex, neosporan spray, and a small first first aid kitInside pocket: Two size 5 diapers, ziplock bag of wipes, arm and hammer diaper baggy, disposable changing pad, a pack of table toppers, neutrogena sunblock for body and the face sunblock, ace instant compress, a light weight wind jacket, and a change of clothes.I can now put this on the outside and put just our lunch box in the basket. I'm IN LOVE!"
3,"Good, but small","I thought this would be slightly larger. Great bag and cute too! But, would be getter if it were larger and included a strap for over the shoulder."
2,Dimensions incorrect,"This is a nice, very well made small bag. I only give 2 starts, because of the incorrect product dimensions. The bag is smaller than described and does not match the dimensions from the manufacturers website."
4,skip hop saddle bag,"This bag is terrific. It's very roomy and fits diapers/wipes/potty seat covers/placemats/hadwipes and more! I bought it for vacation and it held everything I needed and left my hands free! But when I wanted to take everything with me say into a restaurant, it pulls right off and has a handle for carrying. I am very happy with this purchase."
4,"Useful, step by step","Lot of good information in here. The book was revised in 2005, so there is a lot that has changed, for example to have two phone lines if there will be someone using the internet. Having said that, it does raise questions that you should be asking to have a well constructed home."
5,Very informative,This book should be required reading for anyone planning to build their own home. I read it cover to cover and will use it as a handy reference during construction.
1,Outdated,"I've read dozens of books on home design and this is the most useless of all of them. It's full of such brilliant insights as, ""Have the toilet paper holder installed within easy reach of the toilet."" (I kid you not) Some construction methods are suggested which are generally frowned upon by builders and there are suggestions of using materials that are illegal to manufacture.The description says it was thoroughly revised and it has a publication date of July 27, 2010 but another suggestion is, ""Consider running two phone lines into the kitchen in case the household cook plans on being on the Internet while preparing meals."" Do the authors think that most of us still use dial-up?Don't waste your money."
4,Kept my 6yo entertained,"This is the first Horrid Henry series we've read and my 6yo daughter absolutely loves it. We discuss what Henry is doing wrong and she understands that the stories are meant to teach her a lesson. She loves reading this on her own, too. This is the first book that I've read to her that wasnt' a picture book so I was a bit concerned that it wouldn't hold her attention but the stories were funny and interesting enough that she didn't need to see a picture. I will be purchasing more books from the Horrid Henry series."
5,great book,"my son (6 years old) and i read this book while we were at the beach, it was very entertaining!"
4,Pioneer DVR-AO3,"I have been using the DVD burner for 3 months now and I love it. I have not had any performance problems with the drive. It burns DVD-R, DVD-RW, CD-R and CD-RW without a problem. The bundled software is a joke. MyDVD is a poor authoring tool. But so are all of the low cost authoring tools with the exception of Ulead DVD Movie Factory. I currently use Ulead Media Studio 6.5 directors cut for editing and Ulead DVD Workshop to do DVD authoring. To burn DVD data/content discs I use Prassi Primo DVD 2.0 which is easy to use and reliable. If you want to make video DVD's I feel that the Pioneer is the best in this price range. The compatibility with TV DVD players is excellent."
4,Just a chip set not much to say ...It works fine,"The chip set is as advertised, works fine. The shipping was really slow, if this had been summer when we are using the radio controlled truck out side all the time it would have been a major inconvenience. I would not buy if time is important."
4,Removes pencil marks when rubbed against them vigorously,"I bought this item because I wanted a something that, when rubbed against a page of paper bearing pencil marks, would remove said marks completely and effectively. I was not disappointed.Pental makes a smaller version of this product, which seems less prone to snapping in half in the middle of its lifetime."
5,Perfect for college students,"I'm so happy I bought this eraser after digging myself out of a mountain of black dust from the Papermate Black Pearl erasers. The dust that comes off the eraser is non-offensive and light.It may seem a bit expensive at first glance, but a dedicated student will tuck it away in his packsack for use another day."
3,"IT deserved less, but...","This movie, a freak in its own, deserved less stars. Butone cannot help being sympathetic to Sean Penn's character misfortunes (and there are a lot of them) . It is him alone that make this movie a little bit interesting (BIlli THornton is good also; his acting makes us to wanna blow that mechanic apart!) Anyway, everything else is ugly and weird."
1,Tied me up in knots!,"U Turn looked like a Quentin Tarantino type film filled with gratuitous violence and sex. It was,but Quentin Tarantino has a sense of humour and he doesn't keep his characters down. The bad luck that Sean Penn was experiencing just tied me up in knots. Nothing good happened in the movie. The ending was too predictable. The only good thing in the whole movie was Jennifer Lopez."
1,"Sean, I love ya honey, but this just isn't gonna cut it.","Setting this movie in a dry, dead end town parallels the story of this movie perfectly. The acting is fine, but it is so desolate and perverse (I'm sorry but I don't find incest entertaining no matter who directed or starred in it) that it dragged me down with it and I couldn't even muster 2 stars out of it."
2,Very hard to watch all the way to the end,Twp of my favorite stars -- Clair Danes and Jennifer Lopez -- totally wasted. Gut-wrenching sadistic hand-mutilation. Insanity in every direction. Is this what Hollywood really thinks small towns are like?
2,It starts off great! What happened?,"First 3/4 hour: 4 Stars Middle: 3 Stars End: 2 Stars.U Turn gets off to a great start. A guy's car breaks down in the middle of a hick town and he has to try to get out. When he's meeting hicks in the town, it's hilarious. But then it suddenly starts getting silly and feels like they were making it up as they went. But gripes aside, Claire Danes is very funny as the local moron."
1,How long can this go on?!,"One expects self-righteous, pretentious, holier-than-thou from Stone. What one doesn't expect is sheer, torturous boredom. This movie never ends. You'll know how it will end very soon into the movie. Unfortunately Stone feels it necessary to use the Chinese water torture on his audience and make them slowly suffer. I give it one star because I can't rate it lower and because Nolte and Billy Bob Thorton give amusing turns."
2,"awful, awful, AWFUL!","This movie was AWFUL! The camera was shaky all the way through. I tought it was stupid that Jennifer Lopez was having sex with her own father, and her acting was and still is corny. Plus, she shows of her breasts in that movie, which is totally sick, and unrolemodelish. Claire Dane's character was funny, and I found it funny that everytime that man kept trying to get away, something else would happen, and he would have to start all over again.The end was awful, and you see that everything that happen in the movie just kept going in circles. I thought that was pretty funny. All in all, do not go see this movie. It is stupid, and really makes no sense. Plus, they kept playing all this weird Indian music that was really creepy.What a blah movie, with such good actors, too. What a shame."
1,"Illegal ""U-Turn""","""How come Patsy Cline don't make no more records?"" That's a tough one. Bobby Cooper's (Sean Penn) car breaks down in an Arizona town and he meets the weirdest people. A blind Indian (Jon Voight), a fat, extremely greasy mechanic (Billy Bob Thornton), a goofy sheriff (Powers Boothe), a dumb-as-a-doorknob girl (Claire Danes), her boyfriend (Joaquin Phoenix), a mystery woman in a red dress (Jennifer Lopez) and a moldy old man (Nick Nolte). There are too many characters and nobody to care about. A murder plot devises and incest happens. This is a diseased movie. Going to the morgue is more pleasant compared to watching this Oliver Stone mess."
3,"A Light Classic of the Late ""Scuz Film"" Era","Oliver Stone, the director of ""U-Turn"", was a natural to try his hand at the 90's genre that has come to be known as ""Scuzz"" films (of which Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" is the sine qua non). This film has much to recommend it, most notably Stone's evocative editing style that has become his signature. Because the film makes a muted attempt at allegory, however (carefully observe the names and occupations of the 4 main characters), it often lacks the Absurdist sensibility that the best scuzz films do, and, at certain points the plot seems to take rather jarring and arbitrary turns. But the film, like a failed work of art coming late in the career of an accomplished artist, does carry a certain cache as a ""film by Oliver Stone"" and can and should be enjoyed in that context - appropriately as a video rental!"
5,This isn't a Film for Grandma and Grandpa!,"I'll just get started by saying flat out I love this movie. I mean it is one hilarious, sick, twisted and violent beast. Probably not a movie for the over 60 crowd. The performances are all top notch from Sean Penn all the way down to the cameo appearance of Bo Hopkins. And then of course the scene stealer Jon Voight in one of his best performances in years. And I also have to say Jennifer Lopez has her best role to date going the full range from sexy to sympathetic to sinister. The picture quality on the DVD is great and really puts you in the great American SouthWest. Same goes for the sound. Why are you reading this when you should be buying this truly unique film experience."
2,I must have missed the point,"U-Turn is bloody. It's sick, too. Even hilarious in some parts. I'll tell you what it most definitely is: dead boring. The story was established early and effectively but with a limited ensemble of off-beat but uninteresting characters my interest in this picture dissipated with each passing scene. Oliver Stone's direction of this film is nothing special. I feel he was trying to capture the dark wit of the book upon which the film's based. Sean Penn gets to mouth off some great one-liners and Nick Nolte has his moments too. 'U-Turn' is too shallow for my tastes, despite the obviously camp performances and shoddy production values. Not horrible, still watchable but not one I'll be watching again in a hurry."
2,Very powerful and suspenseful but horrible and gory,"Very powerful and suspenseful but horrible and gory. The plot is extremely clever and full of surprises. I would have given it three stars except that occasionally the camera is hand-held and shaky, and i always take stars off for that deplorable trick."
1,YOU MEAN DEAD END!,This was one of the worst movies of the year! The whole plot was stupid and the execution and direction made it worse. No one should be more embarrassed than Jon Voight. This is verifiable evidence of a low point in his career. Everyone else in this film should leave it off their resumes as well.
5,U-Turn,"The movie ""U-Turn"" is smartly done, leaving the viewer up in the air, never knowing what to expect next. It is a great movie & should not be missed!"
5,"great movie, wrong box cover","The U-Turn shipped had a different box cover than the one advertised. I think there are different versions so I returned it for a refund. TCM and importcds (an Amazon seller) also only have the wrong box cover. I ended up getting it from Blockbuster.What's different? Some of the cinematography is different. Maybe it's the VOD version. Maybe it's me but when I watched something was.I agree with all the positive reviews. It's dark and troubling with no redemption anywhere. It's a real groundhog hell for Bobby Cooper(Sean Penn) in Superior, AZ."
1,"A poor, irritating imitation of ""Red Rock West""","I bought this film based on several critic's favorable reviews. I was very disapointed with it because: 1) the film is cut in a annoyingly jerky manner, 2) all of the characters are two-dimensional and lack any development, 3) the performances are unnecessarily over the top, and 4) all of the flashbacks are scenes we have seen already, making them completely unnecessary. I couldn't wait for this one to end."
3,U bomb,I bought this movie a long time ago...This is not 1 of Sean Penns better movies...It's in a desert theres a bad cop..J..LO walkin around trying to seduce the New Guy in Town...and thats aboout it...This movie is Reediculous..
4,"Great, except...","This laptop performs great and looks nice too. I only have 3 complaints/suggestions about it.1. The recovery system is horrible. Doesn't come with a CD. Easy fix is to download from their website all the drivers, and then just have them handy when you reformat in the future.2. The battery life starts of great, around 3 hours. But now a year later it is about 30 minutes.3. The laptop get hot, VERY hot. So hot you can't touch the bottom without burning yourself. I was amazed it didn't overheat and shut down. But after about 10 months that started happening too. Since the machine is so small, there can't be good circulation. I would clean out the fan, but that would void warranty.Overall though, I am very pleased."
5,The Gold Standard,"This is the epic book for anyone interested in understanding how waves work and how different types of beaches, beach heads, sand bars, bays, etc. are formed and interact with ocean swells. It's a wonderful mix of technical information, cool old photos, vivid examples of tsunamis and ships in brutal storm conditions, and it presents a great understanding for anyone deeply interested in surfing and the physical forces that shape coastlines around the planet. I will read and re-read this book many times."
4,Waves & Beaches,"This book is a good start for someone wanting to understand the science of wave action on beaches, but this very, very complicated topic requires years of experience and data gathering and further reading than just one book can offer. But it is a good start."
5,Great pill reminder that does it discreetly,"I am 66 years old and have used many alarm watches in my life. This is by far the best performing watch I have owned. Its six alarms gives plenty of flexibility and reminds you of the time to attend meetings or take your medications without anyone knowing about it. It's vibrating alarm is reminds you very discreetly since no one should know that you are taking meds. The watch also has the feature to switch from vibrating to audible alarm. Unfortunately, at my age, I cannot hear the audible beep well and do not use it. I wish the beep was a little louder. Despite that one point, I will keep on buying this watch every time my watch stops working. Great Watch."
5,GREAT TIME TO TAKE YOUR MEDICATIONS,Bought this to remind my husband when he needs to take his medicine....he loves it and for me it was a great gift. I also liked that it vibrates the reminder instead of ringing. It doesn't look like a medical watch with the words ALERT on it and that gives my man a feeling of privacy. I am so pleased that he likes his new watch and there is still room to add other settings in case he has to take other medications down the line.
2,SUSPENSE-LESS,I did not enjoy this book at all. It was far too bland for my tastes. It was too drawn out. Please don't waste your money.
4,If you love Kay Kendall,"This book is typical English. But if you love Kay Kendall and her unfortunately short career, it is a small gem to be valued."
3,"Great characters, just not my favorite of the series","With so much news lately about the porous border between the US and Mexico, this book seemed to be on a timely topic. In the story Lee Troy and Ed Storey, who are covert military operators for the U.S., are trying to thwart an Al Qaeda plot to cross into the U.S. via Mexico and cause mayhem.The best part about The Enemy Inside is that the author creates believable characters. They are daring and intelligent, but make mistakes too. The best laid plans go awry, but in the end they have the skills to nab the enemy. The enemies are portrayed the same way. They aren't just mindless robots - they are cunning and determined, but their plans gets screwed up too.You can tell the author has experience in the field. He is able to paint scenarios where there is a lot of tension, uncertainty, and action. It's realistic! My only complaint is I thought the plot was a bit slow at time."
5,...love plays out upon an arcing continuum..,"Jim Cohn's first book, a wonderfully ragged compilation capped by the troubled identity of the title character, a soaring bird awed by natural wonder & cursed by an empathy with the suffering world below. For Cohn, love plays out upon an arcing continuum & is not to be categorized. This truth gives Cohn his great range, encompassing as many moments of his experiences as he can get into words. He is not concerned if his poems wander from baseball to the high mountains & then into cramped apartments where small gestures assume the proportions of Times Square billboards. Nor does it matter if at one moment he expresses a quiet, Buddhist acceptance of events while in the next he is screaming because someone cuts out his heart & squeezes it. His contradictions are so human that they build a strong trustworthiness between himself & the reader. Without trust, poetry is useless.Bob Rixon"
2,"Hmm, not exactly ""child sized.""","I purchased many of these keyboards for the kindergarten-2nd grade classrooms in my school district under the premise that were, in fact, child sized. I even called the manufacturer to ensure this condition. While 75% the size of a traditional keyboard, the reduced footprint is because the board does not have a keypad. The key spacing is almost identical to an adult board. If you want a colorful keyboard with a small footprint, this is a reasonable choice. If you want a smaller keyboard for smaller hands, this does not accomplish your goal."
2,Careful!,"This is not a standard keyboard, so kid's learning on this keyboard may have a difficult time switching to a standard-size keyboard in school. Just a word of warning."
4,Compelling Author,"I am currently in the process of reading all of Lesley Pearse books. She has definitely become one of my favorite authors.I find her writing to be comparable with Penny Vincenzi's early books A great read, sometimes a good cry, and or laugh.Enjoy!!!!"
5,Great Stuff!,"My pediatrician gave me a free sample of this for the dry, peeling skin on my newborn's feet and hands. It's greasy so I apply it before bedtime but it works great!"
3,Cheaper at Walmart,THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT AND HELPED MY SONS ECZEMA BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE I TRIED! BUT ITS WAY CHEAPER AT WALMART!!!!
2,OK,We got this toy at the same time as the matching hospital. When we opened it up it was missing key parts and took an awful lot of time to assemble. It's ok at at 5.29 but only if you are having other things shipped as well.
2,Good for triceps. Don't bother otherwise.,"I'm using a range of equipment, hoping to round out my workouts as much as possible. And I've found that doing that has dramatically improved my flexibility and strength in my shoulders and back.Free weights are more flexible in their use. None of the exercises couldn't be done with them or bands.But the bars are good for TRICEPS. They definitely improve the positioning of the involved muscles. One of my shoulders doesn't track as well as it should. And the bar helps to get and keep your elbows close in and perpendicular.It's frustrating, too, that you have to spend a bundle once you need heavier resistance."
2,Too focused on Tk,This book is somewhat imcomplete. It focuses too much on Tk and widgets and lacks a multitude of commands. I have found many more commands for Tcl on the web that are not even hinted to in this book. This book is especially not good for sockets programming.
5,excellent quick reference on ingredients,"I bought this book a few years ago. it has been very useful reference for me as I move around the world frequently, try different cuisines and come across unfamiliar ingredients often. I learned a lot from this book. If you are interested in different cuisines and like to cook with unfamiliar ingredients, owning this book will help a lot."
5,Excellent reference,"This book not only gives you every ingredient you would ever use in cooking, but every single ingredient has a picture. I would highly recommend this book if you can get your hands on it!!!"
2,"Not the worse film I ever seen, but pretty bad","Spolier Alert.Black Angels isn't the worse film I ever seen, but it's not good either. The acting as many have said is really bad. The filming isn't as good as I thought it would be. Most of the time, it looked to be like amateur was filming with his bad camcorder.If you were thinking there was going to be any nudity based on the cover, you would be wrong. I was hoping there was some. :The worse thing this movie did was at the end, the was the ending. It doesn't make much sense. There were two cops going around trying to solve a case, for this corrupt sergent. But at the end of it, the case seemed to just resolved itself and the cops just disappear completely. Then, the corrupt sergent gets caught again from the Black Angels and it just ends like that. Not good.I don't recommend this movie at all."
3,"Still slow, but getting there.","Book 2 of Earthian stands to be far more interesting then the first book.While its still light on the Yaoi, there is more mention and hints at the future development of it.The story now consist of more personal things going on with the protagonist Chihaya and small tidbits of a race of biohumans created by a scientist. Also included is a half angel half human with super powers and a secret, so the drama and plot focus is all over the place in this book.There are a good many examples of the evolution of heterosexual relationships in this book, from characters dealing with grief over the loss of a lover, over the longing to be notice by one, or of finding one, but as before, very little yaoi.Though this second book does build on a good amount of story that really makes you look forward to what happens in the 3rd book!The art has gotten better in this book then the first, which is saying alot since it already had good art.Recommended if you liked the first one."
4,easy listening-,"Koji Tamaki's vocals are the reason why I bought this album; his voice is very beautiful and rich in tone. He is a very talented vocalist. There are several upbeat songs on this album, but overall it has- (as the previous reviewer mentioned-) many ""sorrowful"" melodies. My favorite song on the whole album is ""Wine red No Kokoro"" and ""Koi No Yokan""- (the two first songs on the cd.)The melodies lean towards meloncholic (This is why I give it four stars; I was hoping for a more upbeat album-).It has a definite 80's sound to it, which I am enjoying, and it is very easy listening. I never grew up in or lived in Japan, so my viewpoint on it is probably much different than someone who has lived in Japan.I would say it has a soft-rock/easy listening feel to it.If that is what you re looking for then this is a good cd to purchase. Overall, a good cd, glad I found it!"
2,Instrumental pot-pourri mixes too many flavors,"Presumably Blind Pig has more instrumental material in its catalog than what it presents here, and it might have been better to issue a couple of blues instrumental albums each with two or three tracks from each artist rather than this hodgepodge with its jarring transitions, for example from Charlie Musselwhite to Deanna Bogart, or from Chubby Carrier to Magic Slim. The recording quality varies widely. As for truth in advertising, the CD isn't as bare as it claims; the very first song includes a vocal chorus. These defects are almost compensated for by the cover photography, however, which one hopes will be to a new generation what ""Whipped Cream and Other Delights"" was to mine."
4,M7 V.A.L.E. Aluminum slip on,"Installed on a '11 DRZ400S.Pros: Installation was quick and easy. Looks good. No leaks found.Cons: I wanted a better sound from the bike, but this pipe vs the stock pipe is EXTREMELY loud. It's to much for trips to town or making frequent passes by the neighbor's homes.Recommend adding one of the available sound supressing tips if you ride in areas that noise will affect your neighborhood."
2,Too thick,"I guess I did not know to look for when I ordered these. While they are good quality, they are so thick and much smaller than I thought. I wear a size 5 ring and I struggle to get these on. When I do I can barely move my fingers they are so tight."
4,Good product,"""The volume control works as advertised. I use it with my i Pod so I don't have to use the click wheel when exercising."""
3,"OK, but too much$$","I thought this was a great item until I found a volume control at Radio Shack for half the price. So it doesn't have the cool styling of the Shure, but it's 'half the price'. I bought 2 of the Shures...one for me and one for my 12 year old. Hers was broken after 3 months - hey, she's 12! Mine still works and I like it, but I got her a Radio Shack one and it has lasted her as long as the Shure already for half the price and does the same job.The Radio Shack one is a square box and about half the size of the Shure."
2,Stopped working after 3 months,"While it worked, it worked well. I like the shape. It fits nicely in the hand and is easy to adjust. The sound quality is the same whether my iPod connects directly to my headphones, or through this. In the winter months, I keep my iPod in my pocket and use this - hanging outside of my jacket - to adjust the volume. My recommendation would have been 5/5 had it lasted longer than 3 months."
2,"Good design, Poor Quality","I bought it and worked well for 5 months, after which it just started making a false contact. I can only listen one side and sound keeps switching sides right-left speaker as I move the cable.Good for a while"
4,Really happy with these earrings,"They are lovely, and are small enough that my infant daughter doesn't try to rip them out of my ears. I can finally wear earrings again! My only complaint is that I find it a smidgeon difficult to put them on, but that could be user error -- since it's been almost 11 months since I have been able to wear earrings at all, it's possible my ears have closed up a bit or I've lost the touch."
4,admirable,"I really liked this book. It has wonderful atmosphere - the magic of Lithuania, the blend of sophistication and everyday in Paris. The theme of being surrounded by people who do not understand you really spoke to me. I especially liked the main character,Tomas, because he cared about others but would not give up on his dreams. He shows what was once called strength of character. Best of all, I liked the message that you can love your family and village and country, but still need to leave to find like minded souls."
4,Excellent beginner book,"If you are new to the Korn Shell then this is a great buy. Start here to learn Flow Control, Regular Expressions, I/O and command-line processing, background job referencing, and debugging. This text also covers basic emacs and Vi operations as well as ways to customize your environment in UNIX.I picked this book up as a supplement to learning UNIX. The index proved helpful when I was learning a new command or searching for a solution to my problem. I like the book because it is easier to use than trying to scour the web for solutions. This book will at least narrow the task and help you know what to look for on the web."
5,"Good, but no reference (by far)","I got this book because I needed to learn Korn Shell programming right away, and that is just what it did. When I got to a point where I didn't need the book for a few weeks and put it down. I then needed it again, and had trouble searching the book for what I wanted. Thus, then, therefore, and in conclusion this is no reference book. But an excellent read."
2,"Insufficient relevant examples, badly organized","An unsatisfying book. Somewhat longwinded on the text and the examples fail to cover some easy syntax stuff (eg. string comparisons, p.126, fails to tell you you must have a space on either side of the comparison operator). Would benefit greatly from a reference section that brings all the syntax together. I've spent too much time flicking through the pages looking for something I know I came across at some point but cannot find again."
4,Easy & straight-forward,A great introduction text for those who are begining to learn the Korn Shell. Also just as handy for those moving to the Korn Shell from other shells.Another great book from the NUTSHELL series.I just wish I had purchased the book from Amazon - I would have saved heaps
5,Handy Handbook,"""Learning the Korn Shell"" has been an extremely useful addition to my library as a Korn Shell reference. It is well organized and well indexed."
2,Not well organized and very poor in contents,There's no way you can be a proficient ksh programmer by using only this book. Many topics are not explained clearly nor well organized for a beginner ksh programmer.At least the author could have provide with some clearly written sample ksh scripts for a few major topics.I think that those 'dummy' books are much better learning tool than this book.
3,Not one of O'Reilley's best,"Although this book goes through an introduction to shell programming, and covers many features unique to the korn shell, there are large gaps in between. For example, its coverage of simple string and integer comparisons within ""if"" statements is not presented coherently.It does not make a good general shell programming reference."
3,"Decent Introduction, but not a good reference.","This book is a good introduction to the basics of the Korn shell. After reading through it once, you'll have a good feeling for what you can do with the shell, but I find myself frustrated when I try to use the book to solve problems I encounter using the Korn shell. It seems to take forever to find the right section. I'm looking for another book to supplement this one."
5,A must if you use KSH,"While not as popular (at least in Linux circles) as bash, ksh is a powerful language/tool. Put bluntly, this is one of the few O'Reilly books I have read cover to cover. That isn't to say that the others don't warrant a thorough perusal, but that this book was readily accessible and provided excellent information. I have used it as a reference countless times over the years and do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone using or considering using ksh. Moreover, if you are considering using ksh - or perhaps need a better background in Unix shell scripting - read this book."
1,Poorly organized and incomplete,"For some time, ""Learning the Korn Shell"" was the only source I had for k-shell programming. That was a bad idea. O'Reilly books are usually first-rate, but I guess they can't knock every pitch out of the park. I cannot recommend this book either as an introductory tutorial or as a reference. The first problem is that topics seem to be jumbled together, so that things are hard to find and to follow. Secondly, many subjects are either not covered at all, or are given the proverbial lick and a prayer. Even worse, the indexing is terrible. I find too many cases in which important things (like dot scripts, for instance) are simply not in the index, if they are covered at all in the text. Fortunately, there are alternatives to this book which I find much more satisfactory. By far the best is ""The Korn Shell User and Programming Manual"", by Anatole Olczak, an Addison-Wesley publication. It's pricey (about $50), but it's well-organized, complete, and very competently indexed."
5,A great book about Korn shell programming,"I gave it 5 stars partially because it was given just 1 star unjustly by a few reviewers. From a number of complaining reviews, one realizes that the book title is little misleading. It's not a book for a true beginner wanting to read about ""simple"" examples of shell programs and looking for detailed explanations line by line. This book is concise, to the point, and really explains ""Korn"" shell's features. Even as early as chapter 4 about Korn shell basics, things are explained that a long-time shell programmers may not know. If you do and have done serious, real world Korn shell programming, you'll appreciate it.There were also complains about hard to find things in the book. But from my experience, it's not the case if one really reads it from cover to cover and unerstands the topics presented chapter by chapter. I agree that the book may not be a great reference book, but it was not written as one."
3,For learning the ksh,"A tutorial for learning the ksh. One has to go through it systematically, or one may miss something. When I read it, I sitll had time to read a book cover to cover and so aquired a good handling of ksh which I use very day on UNIX. The book is not particularly good, but it serves the purpose of tutoring ksh, so I can recommend it."
1,Bad organization and Bad explanation,"This book is poor organize and bad explanation. The example is not clear. Hard to understand even though, I had a unix background."
1,bad target,absolutely junk product. The size is way smaller than expected. Picture is very deceiving. Would not recommend this product to anyone
4,Good review,I bought this book to ensure that my 3rd grader stays on track to meet all the US standards while we live abroad. This book is definitely helping in that aspect!
2,A practical start with one part missing.,"This is a practical book which covers key issues such as managing change (without it killing you) and how to include quality in each stage. If you have a complex realignment of the business to deliver, this is good value.However, there is NO direction as to HOW to determine the needs of the customer in terms that will fit the value/supply chain factors.The direction to do this is paramount in the book, but alas there is not much on how to find and assess customer value determinants in ways that these can fit the supply chain drivers.My PhD is on this need to retro fit customer value to a supply chain - I got a few good set up quotes but no direction as to how to make it happen."
4,Great foundational material,"Though the concept of Supply Chain is not new, it is a vague and elusive subject. So much of what has been published on the subject more resembles the typical functional areas of operations or traffic management. Supply Chain is so much more but is often mistaken for the former two.I particularly appreciated this book because of its elementary nature. It made it quite simple to rather quickly develop a comprehension and an appreciation for Supply Chain and, further,to be able to communicate this understanding to others in my organization who are still scratching their heads about this newly implemented function."
3,mostly implementation methodology vs. supply chain insights,"If you are a consultant and interested in learning the implementation methodology around supply chain, then this is an interesting read. However, if you are looking for key insights to innovative ways to do supply chain management, then find another book. Also, although the title is politically correct, there is very little in terms of cusomter driven supply chain strategies."
1,Disappointing,The book is theoritical and does not provide new practical ideas. It reads like an implementation methodology book more than a management book.
4,Applicable and Interesting,This book successfully combines applicable and valuable information on today's supply chain with an easy to read approach. His examples clearly outline an appropriate course of action and path to follow to improve upon a business' supply chain more toward the customer.An excellent book for beginners and for those businesses with a little more experience in the field.
3,Evco white marble rolling pin,"The Evco marble rolling pin is of fair quality in that the marble portion is not completely uniform.I would call it ""out of round"".The handles are not solid wood. But for the money it is a good deal.Evco White Marble Collection Rolling Pin"
5,Marble Rolling Pin,"After looking through every store, I needed a marble rolling pin so that my daughter could make the fondant on my other daughter's wedding cake, I finally went online to purchase--it arrived just in time and the cake turned out perfect. Thankyou very much--it worked very well."
5,One of the greatest Rock--not just Christian Rock--albums of all time.,"Larry Norman was a genius, and ""Only Visiting This Planet"" features this pioneer of Christian rock at his best. All ten of the original tracks are classics, ranging in genre from blues-rock to psychadelic, with some 1950's rock 'n' roll influence mixed in. In addition to the brilliance and quality of the music, Larry's lyrics are some of the wittiest and most thought-provoking of any genre, much less rock. Norman's vocal delivery of his lyrics is one-of-a-kind and down-to-earth. In the discussion of the great American singer-songwriters of the 20th Century, Norman would be included by the unbiased. His was a talent on par with Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, and Randy Newman."
5,Christian Rocker,"Larry Norman's classic in Only Visiting This Planet is rated by CCM as the second Best Christian album of all time. Maybe it should have been ranked first from a lyricist's point of view. The lyrics are gritty and address the scoial issues raging in the early 70's. However,the message remains the same and is as applicable today as it was then. The liner is helpful in giving backgroud information on Norman himself and his journey of faith. This album is the rare find that exemplifies a Christ-like attitude set in today's modern culture without loosing the impetus of the Message. Great for introducing Christian music to your secular friends who are caught in the misperceptin of hymnody as the only Christian music out there."
4,Good value,"I wanted something for our 2-3 yr old daughter to be able to blow off some extra energy. In reading the reviews I was a bit hesitant. It sounds like if you get a good one, they're fine, but their manufacturing processes are variable enough you might get a bad one. We got a good one. We've had it for about a year now and its held up well. We just have 3 girls with 2 cousins)under 6, so they aren't too hard on it. But, I've been in it with them and it works with an adult in it. The door is tight, so its probably helpful if you have the kids be careful getting in and out. It sets up and tears down easily - 10 minutes or so - and actually fits back in its bag. I rated it down for fun a little because a jumper isn't much fun for one kid. That's not the fault of the manufacturer, its just a fact of jumpers."
4,Satisfied with it,"We bought this on sale, for $[...] and free shipping. [...] I wouldn't recommend buying the balls online, as you'll be paying too much for shipping. [...] The bouncer is really durable. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the blower motor has to be on at all times to keep it inflated. Believe it or not but I wasn't aware of that when I purchased it for my 18 month old. She was afraid of it at first because the motor is loud, and when it blew up she thought it was sucking mommy in! But after forcing her in it a few times, she started liking it. I wouldn't buy it for children under 3 who cannot jump with both feet at the same time yet. My daughter doesn't really jump in it, she wants me to go in it with her and roll her around on top of the balls. If you find this on sale, I'd def. recommend buying it."
3,Love the bouncer but have concerns about the smell when it is running,We bought this bouncer for our 5 year old daughter and 2 year old son. They love jumping on it and the size is perfect... we have it setup on the third floor of our home. The problem is that when it is running I feel like I am getting a headache and there is a strange smell... I checked and it does say outdoor use only-- has anyone experienced this? I actually put it away and told the kids we need to wait until its nice enough to use outdoors... the smell is very concerning. I am not sure its safe for indoor use. (and it is the banzai version as another consumer noted). It is made of vinyl and PVC. We are disappointed because we really wanted to use it indoors. :-(
3,Nice little thriller!,"I saw this movie many moons ago... And remember it it pretty well... It is directed by legendary porn director Chuck Vincent who is capable of directing straight films or porn... And also co-stars Jane Hamiliton aka porn legend Veronica Hart, along with Wings Hauser and Linda Blair...The plot is pretty simple, Wings Hauser is married to Kathy Shower, and ends up having an affair with Linda Blair, who is the lover of Jane Hamiliton, who by the way is out for revenge... That pretty much sums it up... But what do you care if the plot is simple, there are plenty of naked bodies to keep you satisfied, and besides it is a nice little thriller with some good acting...Enjoy, I did and hope to again..."
4,Does what it does well but you may want more features,"Up side:- As small, light, and stylish as they come- Sounds and plays greatDown side:- As with other Sony players, each song has to be convereted into the proprietary Sony file format before loading it--you CANNOT directly load a native mp3 file. But not such a big a deal if you're mostly taking trax from CDs.- Small controls, would have been better if they were different shapes or colors rather than all small and silver- Lowish battery life (max. 5 hours on one AA alkaline)- Fixed, internal memory (64mb), not expandable. This is about 80 minutes of music at the medium-high quality bitrate. This means you'll have to manually off- and on-load songs everytime you want to hear a new set. (If I'd thought about this more I might have opted for a player with removable media.)So, if low size and weight are most important to you, it's definitely worth a look. But if you want something flexible and full-featured, you'll probably want to look elsewhere."
4,Worth the money & met the expectation,"I have played this game few years back and wanted to buy a new CD and have fun - this CD that I bought for 8$ (including mailing), was worth the cost and game is fun."
4,my game,"I used to play this game when I was a teenager.. and I am happy I bought the CD again after the previous got damaged.. It's a very smart and intelligent game, that challenge your understanding of a city economy and necessity... in a very old world, but still so common with the reality now a day"
4,Disappointed,I was disappointed with the disk. I shouldn't have ordered it from a cheaper company becaue the disk doesn't always work. It will only play on 1 out of 4 computers in our house and the graphics sometimes don't always show up properly. You get what you pay for; at least this time.
1,The graphics are archaic!!,"This may have been a good game 5 years ago, but compared to recently released games, it is pitiful!! The graphics are terrible!"
2,Does not seem well made,"I was looking for a very fine grit to finish off the sharpening process. The surface seemed rough and uneven to start but improved after some break in. My issue was that there was a sizable burr along the edge of the sharpening surface. Any blade I tied to sharpen would snag, and I had to knock down the burr with another diamond sharpener. I preferred the 1200 grit sharpener produced by DMT compared to this one. Ultimately DMT A4EE (8000 grit) fit what I was looking for."
3,STOMP,This is a good rhythm dvd. Alot of effort went into making this 'OK' cd.It's different. Had a good beat. It was easy to get into.I would purchase it. . . . . . Oh yea . . . . . . I did!
2,Skips on DVD,"I bought this DVD to use in my music classroom, and was disappointed that the first viewing came along with a few skips where I had to skip through some parts of the show. Too bad - The students were disapointed as well.This was a manufacturing problem rather than an Amazon problem. Amazon has always been reliable in general."
3,"Nice, but not what I was looking for...","I was searching for something to make a ""temp track"" for a movie soundtrack, specifically something drum-y or percussion-y. This wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but it was quite entertaining. This is what I knew before I got the disc: STOMP was people playing different things like brooms to make music of a percussive nature, and that's what the disc was. It was entertaining for me... but I had to look elsewhere for the music that I needed for my very specific project."
4,STOMP REVIEW,"I liked it and I came to the conclusion that sometimes is more of the same. A lot of percussion, a little bit to much."
4,GOOD SAMPLE,"GIVES YOU A TASTE OF WHAT STOMP IS ALL ABOUT.YOU HAVE TO SEE IT IN PERSON TO REALLY ENJOY IT.IF YOU ENJOY PERCUSSION,THIS IS A MUST SEE."
4,"doesnt beat the show, but of course, fantastic","of course nothing compares to actually being in the theatre watching the actual show, but that only lasts for a little over an hour. when you want to see the amazing talent of these musicians, this dvd shows it.i highly recommend this dvd. it is absolutley amazing, the skills. you'll really get wrapped up in the catchy rythyms and beats."
5,Loved It!,It was perfect.I gave it as a Christmas gift.They loved it!I remember watching this at school when I was in elementary.It's still amazing
4,Percusión al límite,"Impresionante mezcla de sonidos percutivos. Ejecutado por excelentes músicos percusionistas, que con su precisión y combinación crean ritmos increíbles a partir de escobas, cacerolas, caños, tanques y hasta de partes de coches colgadas en una azotea."
5,Inesquecível...,"Imperdível! Se voc no viu, no perca tempo! Assisto toda a semana este video e no enjo. É simplesmente maravilhoso!"
3,Different.,"None of my kids: 9, 6, 3, and 1 got into this. I bought it based on the other reviews and am disappointed."
3,Less than expected,"I was expecting much more from Stomp. I like them a lot, but this DVD is not a good favour for them."
1,You'll never receive this DVD from Amazon!,I ordered this DVD in November 2005. It's March 2006 and I still haven't received it. I get e-mails every few weeks saying it's being prepared for shipping but it never ships. They won't let me cancel because they say it's in process. Don't bother ordering this DVD. It will NEVER arrive!
3,"Fun, but lacks the excellent pacing of the stage show","This production didn't have to live within the confines of a stage environment, and they definitely used that to their advantage. A good way to convey the energy to someone who's been unable to see the stage production.Unfortunately, this became kind of a ""highlights"" tape. So we see some of the routines in full multi-participant video bites; what we don't see is the great pacing of the stage show bits -- each of which starts light, maybe one actor, and gradually builds to a climax by adding more elements and people. Most of the more minimalist elements didn't make the cut.They need to do another tape or two!"
2,Not what I'd hoped for,"When I saw the Vegas show in December 2008 I was floored! I bought this DVD at the souvenir shop at Planet Hollywood expecting it to be the show I'd just seen. It's not, being exclusively NYC based, much shorter and lacking the humor and audience participation that made the show so charming. If you want a video that better represents the live show then buy the ""Stomp Live"" DVD, available here on Amazon for about $20 ($10 less than I paid for ""Stomp Out Loud"" at PH.) I just watched it and it's great! I still prefer the Vegas production which had a larger stage & cast, it seemed more lavish. Unfortunately the Vegas show has closed."
5,Family Fun,"My boys (ages 2 & 6) and I love to watch this video together. For us, it's not a sit-and-watch as much as a move-and-participate event. There's a lot of smiling and laughing."
4,Stomp Out Loud,I was totally entertained and amazed at the talent of these young people. It can be watched numerous times without ever getting bored. Highly recommend.
2,Not nearly as good as the live show,"After seeing this show in Las Vegas, I really wanted a video that captured the same energy and humour so that I could continue to enjoy the show as home. Sadly, this DVD doesn't come close.The energy is not there, the skits were not nearly as funny and some of the sets were distracting. I missed the simplisty of the stage and fast movement between skits."
4,"This is not today's Stomp show, but still awesome","I'm a fan of Stomp. I've seen them in New York and Las Vegas. This DVD is great since it has the spirit of their live shows. However, don't think you'll get a DVD version of the NY or Las Vegas show. This is an old version of their performances, shot on NY streets with the original, first Stomp cast.So, if you really enjoyed Stomp live shows, you'll enjoy this one as well. But I just want you to know this is a different version videotaped years ago, performed by the first Stomp crew."
3,Good in small doses,Having never seen or heard of this group I wasn't sure what I was going to get. They are entertaining in small blocks. Watching the whole DVD at once becomes wearing after a while. Banging on junk and making rythym with brooms and basketballs is unique and mostly pleasant to the ears. Rated F for fun.
5,Stomp Out Loud,"Very different and very clever...ours kids loved it. In fact, we are going to see the show live in March!"
1,Chino Alums,"After reading this book I could only think what an apt title for such a banal and pedestrian collection of words and sentences masquerading as a novel. Although the author seems to have a real feel for the world of lies and fraud, the story line was preposterous. Had the plot bore some reasonable connection to the real world, it might have been worth reading. But the whole story was so utterly unbelievable as to be downright laughable at times. Like a sloppy counterfeiter who hopes to pass off bogus 20 or 100 dollar bills to an unsuspecting shopkeeper, Ledbetter probably self-published this rank and steamy piece of . . . in the expectation that some unsuspecting reader of pulp fiction like myself would buy it. Frankly, if someone else is foolish enough after reading this review to spend their money and precious leisure time on this vacuous volume of perfectly awful prose, he or she deserves to be cheated by the author as well."
5,"Marvelous, Fabulous on Big Band Kaempfert Style.",I have this video and I watch it over and over. Anyone that is a Kaempfert fan never gets tired of the Kaempfert sound. It is heavenly to me to hear him and his music. He was a very worthwhile person in the music world for which I don't think gets enough credit. Bert Kaempfert is the name in music and this video is just too GOOD.
3,Know your codes beforehand,"This is great ""refresher"" material on the job-site. It is VERY short on length. Sixteen sheets of plastically laminated paper (spill-proof) that increase in size...basically they are self-tabbed by the major topic areas. So the first page is about half the physical length of the last page (which is about legal pad size). I found the material reasonable for being condensed in such a small amount of space, but nearly impossible to ""understand"" a code just from the pamphlet alone. It doesn't make for easy reading unless you know already what you're looking for and its so short that even if you did, you might just miss it."
5,Quick refernce guide.,Great to have on hand when you need to reference certain building codes and don't want to search through the actual code book. Great for field use. Durable and tough. Well done.
3,Seems like a better idea than it was,"For my purposes, this book wasn't as handy of a reference as I thought it would be. It has lots of pictures and is flashy, but I ended up using books about framing and foundations to really get enough information to be useful in building a shed."
5,Wonderful gift,I think it's a wonderful toy not only for small children but even for their parents !As soon as you hear the heavenly music spilling in the air and it makes you think of your child and of all the children in this world ! I would recommend it to anyone regardless of age. We are thankful for the joy it brought to my little daughter !
4,For a first book? Wonderful,"Their first book, I'm told. I don't know why I relate to so many of their main characters. Whatever the reason, they are one of my favorite authors of the past year. Memory Game has eye raising twists and turns throughout. No one seems to be as they appear to be. One downfall...I could not keep all the names straight-- and the first few chapters helped none for me in discerning them. Could be the interuptions of RL."
3,Enjoyable Overall...,"Having just read 'The Memeory Game' while I was sick, I can recommend it as a good novel to while away the hours, and an interesting look at issues surrounding repressed memory. It is one of those novels that creeps up on you, and before you know it, you've become engrossed and finished half the book. The one problem that I had with it was that the ending was too abrupt - it felt like the author had reached a word limit and now had to wrap up as quickly as possible, a disappointment after an otherwise good read. Recommended for holidays or plane trips where you want something interesting but light at the same time."
1,Good Concept but dull writing,"The concept kept me going as I kept hoping that something exciting would happen, but the plot was so dull that even the surprise was unexiting and did not involve the reader at all. The writing was beyond dull and seemed to deal with trivial matters that had nothing to do with understanding the characters, the plot or the overall theme. Not Recommended."
1,Total Disappointment,"This is the first Nicci French book I've tried. It took me every ounce of my willpower to finish it. Totally not a page-turner! I was looking for something a lot more exciting. But instead, this gave me a boring life of Jane, unnecessary/useless details, and a few pages of a murder story told by a person, not even a real-time murder. I didn't like it at all."
3,Had to read,"I had to read this book because I had to do a class assignment. I found that the story\ plot was good but there was too much description to keep me interested. Im not one to pick a book apart because of it's faults and I never will. But there was so much description of every little thing around her that I wanted to put it down, It bored me!. Except I couldn't as with most murder, mysteries I wanted to find out what happened at the end. Overall the book was okay but it took to long with lots of unnesscary crap."
4,On-the-edge-of-your-seat kinda book.,"Overall I loved it. When I was abroud in London for a college semester I bought this book for 10lbs. I just learned that it is selling for $84. I am absolutely astonished!!!! Anyhow, I found the writting a bit below average but the content gripping. I have yet to see the movie but I'm sure it will keep me in suspense the whole way through it. I recommend this book highly and would love to see more of Nicki French's work."
3,"Interesting subject, i.e. repressed memories","Whilst I found the subject matter interesting, i.e. repressed memories, I found the storyline did not hold my complete attention in spite of the twist at the end. Two things jarred me throughout, the first, the central character was living on her own, yet baked constantly (who ate all the food?) and second, she smoked her way through plantations of tobacco. A fair read but not only."
1,Terrible,"For the first time ever, I stopped reading a book. Made it through 136 pages. This book is just pointless. Wish I had read all of the reviews before I bought it."
4,"True emotions, intriguing plot","Nicci French took a potentially explosive topic (repressed memories and those who accuse family members of wrongdoing as a result of retrieving these memories) and addressed it with great emotional honesty and strength. Accusations against family members due to the recovery of repressed memories has happened within my own family and I thought the writing was strong, true, and emotionally accurate, very close to my own real life experience. French was able to package these raw emotions within an engrossing thriller that kept me turning the pages without diluting or cheapening the emotional power of the traumas her main character faced. I was impressed by French's ability to manage the psychological interior of her confused, unhappy main character -- the story is psychologically dead on target."
1,"Good movie, lousy reading","This is a one of the lousiest books I have ever read, but it'd make quite a thriller on the big (or small) screen. Shallow and underdeveloped main character, neurotically smoking and boozing throughout the story which was dull in spite of the interesting subject of repressed memory...... Pity"
3,Entertaining Enough,"This was a rather interesting psychological mystery - but not a very unpredictable mystery. It's never a good sign when the mystery can be solved before reading the book... Just from the synopsis on the back of the book, it was pretty obvious whodunit. There just weren't any real surprises in this book. It was well-written, but neither the plot or characters were enough to make it anything more than your average mystery."
3,way too long,"About half way through this almost 400 page novel, the first one I've read by Ms French, I was ready to give up on it altogether or skip through to the end to find out who did it. The problem, as other reviewers have said, is that there are too many subplots that add nothing to the story. While the recovered memory aspect is important to the plot, it could have been condensed, as could all the parts about the dates, parties, architectural setbacks, etc. The ending, although a twist, was anticlimactic. There was no tension at all when we realize what really happened, as if the writer was as tired of the story as the reader was by that time. Although the story was ultimately somewhat interesting, I'd be reluctant to plod through another of her books."
2,Too drawn out,"I have never read anything by Nicci French before and I found the book by chance roaming around a Barnes and Noble one afternoon. The synopsis really pulled me in, a mystery, bones found in the backyard, deep family secrets...I thought it would be a good read. Well I thought that before I started it obviously. I really was tired of the book about halfway through. Too many characters, too much unnecessary back story and Jane really was annoying after a while. I felt like the book was more about her divorce and fragile state of mind then what the plot was really supposed to be. I almost gave up on it half way through but decided that since I suffered through it that far I might as well finish it and find out the ""who done it"" at the end. The idea of the book was good but the finished product, not so great."
3,ENTERTAINING PIECE OF FLUFF,"I enjoyed Switcheroo by Olivia Goldsmith, but it wasn't as intelligent or as funny or insightful as Bestseller or some of her other books. This was quite a enjoyable book that was basically about 2 women who are with the same man, one as his wife (Slyvie)and one as his mistress (Marla)- both look the same only the wife looks 10 yrs older. Marlahas always wanted to be his wife and Slyvie wants to be his mistress, so they change themselves a bit and viola! swap places without the hapless man knowing anything about it..Although this story asks you to suspend belief, as it is unrealistic in places, plus the main man is definately not the brightest fellow, it is still cute and worth reading if you have a Sunday afternoon free and you don't want a 'heavy' book."
1,Goldsmith Bombs with Switcheroo--Worthy of a Zero Star,"I thought ""Bestseller"" ""First Wives Club"" even ""Fashionbaly Late"" were interesting, funny, witty, etc...Switcheroo on the otherhand, it is hard to believe that Olivia Goldsmith actually wrote this piece of garbage. The dialogue and characters are so unrealistic (not to mention unlikable). It seems like Goldsmith wrote this book in hopes of having a screenplay created...it reminded me of a ""Waiting to exhale"" copycat. I kept hoping the book would get better, but sadly, it got worse! Don't waste your time on this book. Goldsmith seems like she is trying to inject humor and wit into the characters, but the entire book is flat, dull, and if you liked Goldsmith's other works, you will be thoroughly disappointed. Makes me wonder if Goldsmith is running on a deadline and selling out like one of her characters in ""Bestseller""."
2,Fairly boring reading; lacked oomph!,This is not one of Olivia Goldsmith's best books. I enjoyed First Wives' Club and really looked forward to reading this one but was disappointed due to how boring this book actually was! It's a real yawner!
2,Look for the upcoming movie!,"While Switcharoo certainly isn't the book to choose for enlightened reading, the absurdity of its characters will keep you entertained. It reads like a screenplay, which may be the intent, given the big screen success of ""First Wives Club.""It's a great way to spend a rainy Sunday, but don't look to add this one to your book club reading list."
1,very disappointed as well,"I wish I had read these reviews before I bought the book - read The Bestseller and Flavor of the Month, then went out on a hunt for more Goldsmith books. I can't believe this is the same author - something is very wrong - did her editor write the other two books ( which were by the way excellent even though a bit contrived)when I got to page 100, I threw it away very sad"
4,My thoughts on Switcheroo,"This book was FUN! The ending was predictable but then it wasn't. You kind of know what's going to happen with one person but not the other. So it's not disappointing! It was farfetched (but hey what'd ya expect it's fiction!) I liked this book. It was worth the time and money. It's easy-reading. Like I said before ""FUN!"" No thinking hard or being confused just sit back and relax and be entertained with this book. You'll love it!"
1,"Don't waste your money, or your time which is more valuable","I would give this book a BIG ZERO STAR.. If you like Olivia Goldsmith's books please, please skip this one like the plague.. but I recommend you read her book ""Marrying Mom"" it is hilarious, you will smile, chuckle, guffaw and finally cry with laughter."
1,Switcheroo is a Stinkeroo,"Olivia Goldsmith has taken her fascination with achieving sexual desirability through diet, exercise, and plastic surgery to a ridiculous level. The devices that served her stories in previous books have become the substance of the story in this book, much to the detriment of the work and the dismay of her loyal readers. Whether she hurried to meet a deadline or has simply lost her muse, Ms. Goldsmith has far missed the mark with this attempt."
2,Fluff has its place...,"Sometimes, it's just nice to relax with a quick read and Goldsmith's target audience tends to agree. However, the most overtly annoying aspects of Goldsmith's style I find is that she takes herself too seriously and is too self-indulgent in her style. Perhaps it is the blatant didacticism which is distracting, the predictable ""moral"" at the end where everyone learns a lesson and everything goes on. At other times, the reader can practically hear Goldsmith gloat over sentences and passages she particularly likes. But, what author doesn't? Overall, it is charmingly quick and predictable. Jane Austen, she is NOT, she lacks the subtleties and character developments which make Austen classic literature and Goldsmith, well, best seller beach book material."
2,"Please, please NO MOVIE!","I was extremely disappointed in this book. It was fluff, just like ""Marrying Mom"". It read like it was dashed off because of a deadline, not because Oliva had a great idea. It could have been so much better, however, none of the characters were engaging. I found myself wondering why? why? why? Then I wondered why I finished the book."
1,"It's supposed to be funny, but actually it's a sad story","The funnier the author tries to be on this one, the stupider and more pathetic the book becomes. All of the characters are totally unlikeable, shallow, arrogant, and stupid. I don't think that these particular personality traits are funny, and I don't see how Ms. Goldsmith ever got this implausible, sorry book published. First Wife's Club it isn't!"
3,Entertaining to a point,"This book was funny for a while but toward the middle, I was anxious just to finish it. Bob was a first class jerk. Sylvie wasted too much energy on him and Marla was simply a bimbo. Enough already."
3,Pure silliness,"Olivia Golsmith isn't exactly a literary genius, and the plot goes beyond implausable into the realm of utter unbeleiveability. However, I really enjoyed this book. The characters, especially Sylvie's mother and Marla, are very funny, and the dialogue had me laughing out loud. I particularly loved the scene where Sylvie reveals Bob's affair to her mother, confirming it with the damning evidence that he'd gotten a pedicure. This is a great book to escape into - just leave your skepticism and sense of realism at the door."
2,I don't know.....,"Not one of Olivia's best, as far as I'm concerned. I don't care about how unbelievable the plot is (though it IS THE most unbelievable of her books I've read so far), but I was extremely annoyed by what I considered to be a terrible, terrible ending to an otherwise perfectly good book. I won't give it away, but I was very disappointed, so much so that I held off reading another Goldsmith for another 2 months after reading 3 in a row....."
4,"Let's make this a movie, Goldsmith!","I enjoyed this light-hearted and ""oh so true"" novel about women and men and what happens when the man goes off to play! True, the story makes plenty of male-bashing jabs (I am finding this is all too often common in Goldsmith's books?) but it was told so hilariously well! It is amazing men and women share the same planet together!I would have changed the plot just a little. I was expecting Marla to be the love child between Sylvia's father, Jim, and his mistress! Wouldn't that have been interesting! How else could they look so much alike??!! Well, maybe the silver screen will pick up on this twist to her novel. Happy reading!"
1,Awful - One Star,"I feel awful having read this book. It is such a bad read that I felt bad physicaly and mentaly after listening to this crap. This thing wasn't funny. There wasn't a single moment where I even recognized humor. Maybe Goldsmiths attempt at satire was lost on me, I don't know. These one-dimensional charachters and their absolutely pointless lives. I was hoping that Bob would blow his head off in that car of his. The ending of this book is one of the biggest cop outs of all time. I do not recommend this book to anyone."
1,zero stars -- this book is terrible,"Well, at least I got 25 cents for it at my garage sale.this book is terrible.and the grammar is rotten. Doesn't she have a highly paid editor?Don't buy this book"
1,Pastor,"I went to FourSquare Church for 8 Years. and was a Childern's Pastor. I used to Put books on Peoples Desks at Work like this one, Then. The I said to Myself if I'm not an Eye whitness I am a Faults Whitness. So I started going to the SDA Church.Then I saw a whell know Pastor from North West Foursquare Church. After all the bible teachings iv'e learned after 6 years. this book is stupid? and have a lot of falts in it."
3,Adventism,"I really can't give a fair review at this point because I've only read the first 4 Chapters. Then I decided I had to put it down for now. It's a bit over my level of scripture knowledge right now.I sense he is still a little wounded/angry maybe.Shortly after the purchase of this book I bought 'Kingdom of The Cults' Walter Martin, apparently, a evangelical standard which is very scholarly and objective. Adventism is not considered a cult by Mr. Martin so he covers it in a 125 page appendix. I agree with Mr. Martin's evaluation for the most part, but I believe the 7th Day Adventist heterodox theologies are more dangerous that he reports. I have see it first hand.I will return to this one eventually, but I'm on some other more pressing discoveries at this time."
4,Exposing Seventh-day Adventism is an eye-opener,Exposing Seventh-day Adventism is an eye-openerto the cultic doctrines of Adventism. Both SDA members and the public that read this book would benefit greatly from Dr. Kelly's research. He does an excellent job of documenting and exploring the twisted and misleading Bible interpretations of the SDA prophetess Ellen G. White. I highly recommend reading this book.
1,Not accurate with twisting of beliefs and doctrines.,Seventh Day Adventists actually base all their doctines on the bible alone. This books author claims that Seventh-day Adventism entices members into it using trickery and half-truths. There is nothing further from the truth. They are an open book with their beliefs and scriptural support clearly stated in their 28 fundamental beliefs. The author either ignorantly or knowingly is misleading readers.
1,Terribly inaccurate.,The utter inaccuracies within this book about the SDAs and Biblical theology made further reading a waste of time. This is not a useful resource.
1,SMH,"i wish people would stop fighting and arguing over religion. Seriously, why wouldn't you go back to the bible for references? Seventh Day Adventists use the same bible as everyone else. Contrary to popular belief, Adventists have not modified the bible or the practices that the bible teaches. If you want to, get knee deep into research you will find many reliable sources that outline the religions & people who have modified and changed things. Apart from all this, FROM THE BEGINNING THERE WAS ONLY ONE ""RELIGION"": LOVE. We all have modified things by writing books like this, reading them, and passing them down to others who then write their own books and continue the cycle. Learn to love God and drench yourself in His word. Leave the judgement of what is right or wrong up to Him. If you open yourself up to truth, you will find it. In the end we will ALL be exposed."
1,Accurate? No.,This book is extremely unnaccurate and ridiculous. All the anti-Adventist stuff that is out there in books and on the internet just proves that the devil hates the truth and will do anything to smear the Adventist message.
3,case too long,"I though this case had more padding. It's too big for my 5'5"" bo staff and flops over when the staff is in the case."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this along with some other things. Because this vendor will not accept credit cards, I had to give my bank account number for the entire order. Since I have Discover and get cash back, I was not very happy about this. And then they cancelled the Bo Staff Carrying Case part of the order because they said it was out of stock! Several days later I check back here and it's still posted, saying ""in stock"". What's up with that?"
2,Poor image quality,"The Pentax Optio 550 5MP was light and easy to use, but I was unimpressed with the image quality. My daughter's 3MP Kodak produced sharper pictures. The image quality may have been better if sufficient memory had been included with the camera to store pictures at a high resolution setting. The16MB memory card included with the camera did not have sufficient space for even one shot at the highest resolution setting."
2,Streamline battery,"Started to look great when the package was opened, charged installed battery, really complicated, not, flipped switch no power,, removed battery, tested via Fluke meter, 3.2 volts, no good, tested again, on charger, 3.2 volt DC,, complete discharge action performed, recharged. Lights up, dies. Battery junk."
1,Where were the editors?,"Did anyone edit this poorly written novel? There were so many typos the last third of the book, it was difficult to keep reading. I normally LOVE novels about the Civil War, but this one was poorly written, disjointed, and down right implausible. That President Davis and General Lee would offer frequent, detailed briefings to a woman while planning a frantic war effort was just too difficult to accept. Also, there was no feeling that this woman loved her children, they were never together! I could go on. What a disappointment."
5,A REALLY GOOD BOOK TO READ,"I COULD NOT STOP READING THIS BOOK . IT WAS AS IF I WAS ONE OF THEM, GOING THROUGH THE CIVIL WAR, AND THE TIME ,AND PEOPLE SURROUNDING IT !"
1,Awful,"Just awful. Maybe I don't get it or something, but the ""religion"" is just laughable. ""The only thing constant is change."" That's a religion? What? There's nothing else to it it makes no sense. That's why all these people are following her?One star for some ok dystopian future ideas. Not worth it though. Waste of time."
4,"an apocalyptic vision, with mutunt","This is a very intense story set against the backdrop of the breakdown of an industrial society. Butler's vision of a chaotic LA is truly chilling, from the near-defenselessness of its innocents to the killing fury of its villains. In a way, it is the most realistic and grim from of all her science fiction, the most likely to happen.It never ceases to amaze me how ambitious Butler is! In earlier novels, she invents a divide of human speciation as well as a hybrid race that springs from extraterrestrial genetic traders. At the center of this story is an empath - a mutant whose abilities are not as fantstic as those in Butler's other novels - who embarks on a crusade to found and lead a new religion.Thus, Butler addresses the great themes of humanity with great inventiveness and utterly superb writing. She is a first rate novelist.Howver, I did find this novel rather slower than her others.Warmly recommended."
5,"A New World, Hints of the One We Already Have","I was thoroughly captivated by the world Ms. Butler crafts. Having worked outside the United States in many unstable parts of the world, I can see parallels in the responses of ordinary people to the breakdown of authority, to corruption and chaos. We see all kinds of answers in this book -- incapacitating fear, largely futile attempts at escape, but also an intense hope for basic humanity.Ms. Butler could use a better copy editor, but that's a minor distraction. Highly recommended."
4,Exceptional Writer....Exceptional Story,"I've heard about Ms. Butler's talents for about a year now, but this is the first of her books that I've read. I wound up devouring it in just under two days. A frightening vision of the future and from one that lives in L.A., on some days, not all that implausible. I found the description of re-decent into legalized slavery and company towns, all with federal and local blessings very frightening. I agree with a previous reviewer that the Earthseed religion did not add all that much to the story, but taking it as a story of human preserverence over chaos and evil, it was a great read. I highly recommend it."
3,Parable of the Sower,"I read this book for a class of mine. I think my religion professor is nuts for making me read this and write about it as a religion. Otherwise it is a good read. Parable offers a glimse of a twisted future. The religion itself offers beautiful prose, but i feel it needs to be more substantive. Anyway, I am not a science fiction fan but Octavia Butler has got talent and it shows in this book. I will surely be checking out her other stuff. Another note, I read this book over the weekend when my roomates were gone and I was alone. Do not do that, this book makes you get chills down your back every so often! Enjoy!"
3,Decent read.,Good story telling. Good writing. Some of the ideas in the book make you want to roll your eyes but all in all a good book.
3,So-so,Very well written. Very dark. The writer has a great imagination however the story can easily led one into despair.
4,Very nice,It was interesting book. Made me excited to read it every night. Who knows What Can really happen in year 2025
5,Great Read,"Heard the author mentioned on a TV, and decided to give her a try. An avid science fiction fan I really enjoyed this novel. Highly imaginative and a harbinger of what's to come if we---as a nation---can't get it together NOW."
5,Great Discovery,"I'm sorry it took me too long to discover this author. A friend was reading the other ""Parable......"" but I wanted to go back and read how it started. I read ""The Hunger Games"" and it's distopia subject and found this to be every bit as entertaining I can't hardly wait to read the second installation It‘s sort of scary. Are we heading in that direction as a society?"
4,An interesting vision of an American dystopia,"The basic idea of this book is that mid-21st-century America is in shambles-- crime and drug addiction have torn cities apart. Butler's story centers on a Black (Butler always capitalizes this) teenage girl who escapes the horrors of future L.A. (isn't present L.A. bad enough?) and travels north towards the Pacific Northwest, gathering ""disciples"" along the way. The girl's personal philosophy ""Earthseed"" is what draws people to her; it is basically a derivative of process philosophy/theology. The principle of this school of thought, in short, is that God is change. The idea of basing an entire novel around process theology is fascinating. The story Butler tells is engaging and well-constructed. Her vision of an American dystopia is very thought-provoking."
4,A pleasant surprise.,"This is very very good. Maybe at the height of my spiritual awareness I wouldhave given this 5 stars, but at times its a little too preachy for me. Still,its an excellent read with some material worth keeping."
4,Engaging Science Fiction,"Dismal, violent view of the near future, in which shortages have become so acute as to destroy the social fabric. The book is in the form of a diary of a teenage girl, whose determination, courage, and optimism put her into the role of a survivalist, and ultimately a religious leader.To criticize the book for a lack of realism misses the point. It is science fiction, and where it has a ring of truth it makes you look at reality differently. Butler is writing fiction, and does not promise that she thinks everything will ever be as she describes it in this mesmerizing book.Personally, I am not actually a fan of science fiction, but this book hooked me. Couldn't put it down."
1,Boring,Not much happens in this book and you don't really care.Nine more words were required so here they are
3,It was okay...,"I read this for a class, and found it to be an interesting read.In the early part of the book, there were a lot of characters to keep track of, but as the story progressed, there seemed to be fewer...with those we were introduced to, expanded on.The story centers around the California-based protagonist Lauren Olamina, who starts off as a 16-year-old who lives in a dystopic future that has race and class issues. Two years later, she travels to Northern California in order to build a community around Earthseed, which is focused on shaping God and Destiny according to the needs of her community that is supposed to escape the negativity that has befallen society.There isn't really much at stake, or a sense of urgency; it's more of a soul-searching book.I understand that this book is part of a two-book series, which was going to be a trilogy before the author passed away. Still, I plan on reading ""Parable of the Talents"" in due time."
3,Critics should take a chill,"I have just finished Parable of the Sower. It was my first book by Butler, and may not be my last. The story caught my attention in the first fifty pages. I was hooked on the fate of a girl my age in a situation that could be my own. Now you must understand that the book is si-fi. It takes place in a world that is slowly being destroyed, like the torture of a war prisoner beaten to his knees, but in this world Butler deals with issues that every girl faces. This is a coming of age story. Like Catcher in the Rye the main character deals with loss, love, and a changing world outlook. Don't misunderstand this book will never be a classic it is not written in a way to speak to many people on many different levels, but it is a great quick read for women ages 12-35 or anyone who feels like they are still dealing with the pangs of adolecence. Butler is an excellent writer and I will continue to place her on my summer reading list."
4,Great for OB fans,"This is not my favorite Octavia Butler Novel, but it is still well written and it is a good story."
2,parable of dispair,"this was the most depressing book in the world. luckly i didn't buy the book by choice but only as part of a book club. If you looking for nothing good to occur, you've found it in this book. All that is bad about society, found wound up in these 300+ pages. I suppose the ultimate message was to keep plugging along depite the negativity, but who needs that lecture."
1,"Ugh, never again.","This is my first time reading Octavia E. Butler and it will most likely be the last; I was coerced to read this novel for one of my classes in college--unfortunately. The book falls flat and is more bland than anything else. The writing style is as follows: cause and effect, cause and effect, cause and effect. It is uninteresting and uninspiring; also, the main character, Lauren, her religion or silly ""philosophy"" is weak and has more of a floating effect than something that is concrete. All through the book she mumbles: ""God is change"", but Butler does not even attempt to go any further. I fail to realize what Lauren actually meant: oh, and the ending is horrible. Do not read this book: it's a slow read and boring."
1,Utterly depressing,"I have read many sad books and novels with depressing themes, but I have never read anything so terribly upsetting as this book. There is nothing positive or happy in the entire novel- NOTHING. The action described is so horrific, I actually had a nightmare about what I read. I hated this novel more than anything I've ever read. I can't think of one good thing about it and I'm typically a very fair person. I would never recommend it to anyone and I just wish I hadn't wasted my money on it!"
1,empty,"I found this alternately depressing and empty, not connected enough with today's real world to be inspiring on an immediate level, yet not far-out enough to be inspiring on a far-out level.There's a lot of adolescent-like musimg about the meaning of life, which might be paraphrased as ""God is change, that's all I know, I can't explain it any further but I know it with a passionate certainty..."" There's too much ""I can't explain it but I'm really really sure."""
3,"Just okay, not bad and not great","I can only speak from my own frame of reference, despite all the great reviews. I know it's an apocalyptic novel, but even so it is very bleak indeed. It is well-written for sure, with honest and believable characters. For reasons I couldn't pinpoint, it still failed to capture my interest. It was a bit slow, and perhaps due to all the dark incidents, I was unable to really get behind any of the characters. I really couldn't find glaring weaknesses or great strengths with the book, so for me it was average."
1,Disappointed,"It seems like a good idea, but why would it have been designed to have a maximum length of only 35 inches? I apparently didn't notice that part of the description before I ordered mine. It does me no good unless I am walking barefoot, and I am only 5'7"" tall. So, consider that point carefully! Also, it is very easily over adjusted which the instructions clearly advise against. Then, considerable time is spent trying to reposition each segment. Apparently the name ""Micro Pole"" refers to its usable length rather than its compactability. It's suitable for short users that have plenty of time to make adjustments to it."
3,Too big,I thought this item would be smaller than the equivalent in a standard surge protector. It is not. It's overpriced for what it is.
3,"Good design, cord too short.","This is a simple and elegant design. The only drawback for this particular model is the 4' cord length from the wall outlet, I found it to be too short for most applications in my house."
5,Squid plug,"I purchased one for myself and extras as gifts, because of the usefulness of this product"
3,Anusual but Very practical,The fact that every plug is seperate from the rest makes it much more convenient and practical. The classic style didn't fit our needs (we needed space between the plugs to allow ALL of the cords to be pluged).This device is GREAT. DID THE JOB.
4,Perfect for unusual projects or situations,Sometimes a traditional powerstrip just won't do. This is a great product for those times.
1,Red Wine Goes With Murder by Paula Carter,"An amateurish story that insults Southerners, feminists and American tourists in one fell swoop. The dialogue is often silly without true humour. This book is definitely not in a class with those by authors such as Grafton, Kellerman (Jonathan or Faye) or P.D. James.I found myself scanning pages to avoid the simplistic repartee between characters. It is hard to believe the supposedly educated lead characters had such a disregard for foreign languages or customs and such a limited knowledge of common French phrases. C'est dommage! I will not buy another book by this author until her writing matures."
4,6 Therapies and 1 Client,"This book illustrates how all roads lead to Rome. Essentially, the same client is treated through six different therapies showing that no matter your theory, application of said, when done right, may lead to an effective treatment outcome."
3,"Great product, but -NOT- Dishwasher Safe","Great product, but the review is inaccurate. This product is HAND WASH ONLY (see uploaded picture). The other issue is that the outer frame is not rigid (the entire mold is silicone). Therefore, to get the mold into the freezer easily (we have a bottom load freezer), you need to place the mold on a stiff backing material like a piece of cardboard.The only FRED Ice Cube tray that is DISHAWASHER SAFE that I have purchased is the ""Stone Cold"" one (looks like Easter Island heads). <...>"
2,eh,"Nice idea but the reality is that the cubes are very difficult to get out and by the time you do, the cubes have already lost some of their angular shape - which is the reason you buy this thing in the first place. Then by the time you put it in your drink, you can't tell these cubes from a regular one within 30 seconds. Can't fight physics, I should have known better...oh well."
2,nice idea but poor execution,"bought it , used it twice and tossed it . the way they freeze makes it way too much trouble to get them out. after you get 2 out you pretty much give up and user regular ice"
4,cool!!!,the mold came very quickly!!! and in good condition. Absolutely love it!!! i got it to make jello jewels for my daughters birthday party. it is a little difficult to get the jello shapes out and i do ruin some of them but over all i am very pleased with the product!!! my daughter loves the jewels!!!!
2,nope,"I wouldn't' recommend this product. The ""silicone"" is cheap and warped. Would be great if it were a more quality material."
2,Nice concept but,"I like the idea, but this ice cube tray does a spotty job. The cubes are often mishapen and really hard to get out of the pack. Also, many of the gem shapes are so round that they just look like a ball after a few mintues in a drink."
5,Super Cool,I bought this for my childs pirate birthday so i could have a treasure chest of cool colored gems. They worked great they were easy to pop out and everybody loved them. Great item!
3,"Fun, but a little difficult to use","This makes jewel-shaped ice cubes, exactly as advertised, but it is a little difficult to get the ice out of the silicone. I found a technique that works well - and maybe the silicone will loosen up a bit with use to make release easier. Overall, I recommend this product."
4,icy jewels!,"Today the thermometer hit 84* (Cambridge, MA) and I was very pleased to receive my ice cube trays! The silicone is thick and seems durable, and I am sure it will be no problem to remove the gems. The jewels are everything I was hoping they would be, and I am very pleased."
1,Jewel Heist,"There was nothing jewel like in these ice cubes - I am going to try a premium super clear bottled water next time, if I bother with a next time! They are also a lot smaller than they look in the photo; nothing like the hand carved huge cubes I was trying to fake....."
3,"Fun for novelty, hard to get perfectly clear","I was in the market for some silicone ice cube trays and when I saw these Cool Jewels, I had to try them out. Their ""neatness"" factor is awesome, but unfortunately their ""usefulness"" factor is below average.Do not buy these if you want a ice tray - the cubes are too small (melt quick) and since it's a wobbly silicone tray with many jewels that require a fill to the top, it's sort of messy. You're better off just buying the straight square silicone trays.Do buy these if you want a novelty item to plink into guests' drink glasses. However, since these are pretty small and melt quick, you'll probably be buying quite a few trays.It should also be noted that in order to get the perfectly clear ice cubes as shown in the pictures, you've got to move the water around every once and a while so that the air bubbles don't get trapped in the forming cube and cause the white spots. In other words, expect your diamond cubes to have some pretty visible flaws."
3,Ice Baby!,"Interesting product. Good idea. But for some strange reason these ice cubes melt quicker than ice cubes made in the ""regular"" ice cube trays. The ""jewel"" shape doesn't last very long either even with a beverage that's already chilled. Got a cheaper ""shaped"" ice cube tray at Ikea."
3,Pretty good buy,"It's not really easy to get the cubes out in one piece, they do tend to crack, but it's nothing to sweat over. they seem well made."
1,Don't put them in the dishwasher!,"I bought 4 of these trays and stuck them in the dishwasher to clean them before use. Any of my other food grade silicon I can stick in the dishwasher just fine. Well, these warped and won't even sit flat on the counter anymore. No where on the Fred & friends website, the package or the tray does it state it is not dishwasher safe."
3,Review for Craft Use,"I didn't buy this product for making ice cubes; I bought it for molding plastic resin for making jewelery/magnets/etc.As far as that goes, they worked, OK, not great, but OK. I think even for ice cubes their shape would cause issues. The fact that the molds get smaller at the top makes it really difficult to get the pieces out. Not horrible, but for craft use they're not my #1 choice of mold to pick when choosing what to make."
3,Jewel Ice Cube Tray,"Love the Design and End product of these ice trays.... Only problemis that the cubes can be a pain to get out of the tray, and if you areas accident prone as I am... Ice cubes will occasionally go flying!"
3,Cube tray.,"Cube tray is rather small, the cubes are kind of hard to get out, and (because of impurities in tap water...ect.)the ice cubes were pretty cloudy. Worth the novelty for a fun cocktail... The fake teeth ice tray is much more fun."
3,Ok... Big fun for children though...,"While the ""gems"" lose their shapes quite quickly, it's still a good idea to make these gemstone-shaped ice cubes as they look quite glam actually. Better filled with juice as the ice made are not quite clear if plain water is used."
4,Cute ice cubes,"Bought this product while on an exteneded business in St Paul, MN. Bought it of amazon because it was cheaper (than in museum stores or other online sites) and with free domestic shipping. Didn't use it until I get back to singapore 3 months later. It's kind of fun looking at big diamonds floating aroudn in your drink. The rubbery mold tray though tends to deform when kept in a non-horizontal or flat position. Luckily it does recover to its original shape after putting it flat and proper after a while. Think it may be due to the hot, humid tropical climate. Anyway, had fun making those jewel ice cubes and made my daughter very happy. like it alot."
4,Cool jewels ice cube trays,Not what I was expecting(a little small) Will be fun for my graduation party this summer!!
4,ice jewels,Its just another ice tray. The diamond ice doesnt sparkle......( or am I expecting too much?)
4,Vogue/Butterick Step-By-Guide to Sewing Techniques,"This has been a great resource for me returning to sewing after 25 yr. hiatus. I have gone back to it over and over again the past few years to see how they explain something I'm not clear on. It may not please very experienced sewers, but as the title says,""Step-by-Step Guide to Sewing Techniques"", not Couture techniques."
4,Good - but not great,"Will certainly help the beginner, but don't expect it to get you through a pattern for a very complicated designer garment. A good reference, but it shouldn't be your only one."
5,Humorous conflict and delightful resolution,"Failing to name the protagonist, Bottner allows us to slip into the main character's emotional seat and experience the teeth-gritting, tyrannical Bootsie Barker. How would you handle such an ill-mannered, fearsome guest? Discover the imaginative, realistic resolution expertly conveyed in gratifying mood-injected illustrations."
1,horrified!,"My three-year-old daughter was horrified by the artwork and the scary Bootsie Barker. She is seen tearing a book, then terrorizing a little girl, then holding her hand over the little girl's mouth so she can't yell for help! Pulling her by the hair, throwing her pet salamander, pinning her to the floor by stepping on her and pulling her braid while her face is smashed into the floor! I have yet to find the humor here....HOW is this funny? And how does this little girl eventually cope with this bully? She threatens her back!! NOT the example I want to teach my child. (By the way, where was the mother when all this behavior was taking place?) This book will NEVER be read again in my home! I am astonished at the previous high reviews!"
5,"We all know a ""Bootsie"" don't we?","We purchased this book on the recommendation of my son's preschool teachers. At just 4 years old we had encountered our very own ""Bootsie Barker!"" After trying all of the conflict resolution tricks we knew, the teachers suggested a little humor might help. This story may not be looked at as ""P.C."" but it can definitely help to empower a child! When you've tried everything else, sometimes it's helpful to see that the ""nice guy"" can WIN! I've read this to a group of children as well as my own and they love it, always waiting to see just what will happen next! This book doesn't disappoint and leaves you with a sly little grin-- right up until the very last page!"
5,my 5 uear old loves this book!,"My daughters kindergarten teacher told us there is s ""mean girl"" in the class, the teachers are dealing with it,but we should talk to our kids about how to handle a mean girl too. I got this book and my daughter loves it! I like that the mom has a good way of handling it, but the daughter problem solves also. I'm really happy with this!"
5,What a Character!,"I absolutely love, or love to hate, Bootsie Barker. She conjures up all the feelings that come with being bullied, which helps the reader identify with the narrator that much more. I found myself thoroughly appreciating the narrator's daydreams of having awful things happen to Bootsie. The fact that the two mothers are friends and Bootsie is in her home on a regular basis, just adds to our heroine's initial feelings of hopelessness. The ending is sweet desserts. Our narrator has found a way of speaking up for herself and outsmarting Bootsie that is intelligent and proactive. This one has been a favorite at our house for years now. Also, look for the great small details in the illustrations that are sometimes funnier than the text. Having the pet salamander being taken away on a stretcher, complete with an IV, makes me chuckle every time. Don't worry. The salamander is fine.Chris Bowen,Author of, ""Our Kids: Building Relationships in the Classroom""(give it a search...check it out)"
1,Also horrified!,"This book was scary! Not only was I alarmed at the behavior of Bootsie, but the ""victim"" in the book wishes ill of Bootsie. I don't think this teaches children the best ways to deal with bullying, to the contrary, it glorifies harmful thoughts. I DO NOT recommend this for any child."
1,This book is not about resolving conflict,"I was hoping that this book would teach children about resolving conflict in a long term healthy way with difficult ""Bootsie"" people in their lives. Instead it taught revenge, unforgiveness, bitterness and fear. A look into Bootsie's life may have been a better place to look for reconciliation. There will always be Bootsie people in kids' lives and teaching distancing from them, threatening them or wishing harm to them will birth much the same. A terrible negative book without much love."
1,Please please please don't buy this.,I would not recommend this turntable unless you ABSOLUTELY need a USB input to your computer for recording. There are much better quality players out there that are much cheaper and can be easily hooked into a computer (mic port) for recording.Why you would buy this instead of a respectible record player that's $50 cheaper I'll never know:Audio-Technica AT-PL120 Professional Direct-Drive Turntable
1,Don't waste your money.,"I purchased the ION TTUSB approximatelyIon TTUSB Turntable with USB Record3 years ago. When I first obtained the item I was able to transfer one vinyl lp to my computer and was able to burn it to cd. At the point, I also purchased a dust cover for the unit and placed it on a shelf in my closet, where it has been stored for the past couple of years untouched, covered & unmoved. A week ago I decided to undertake the task of transferring the lps with my stored turntable. To my chagrin I discovered that the unit was not functioning. I called Technical support and logically decided that the belt was stretched and unused and may have been the problem. The ION cost $100 new, and additional $40 for the dust cover, another $20 for needles should they wear out and $10 for a new belt. Now I can dispose of the entire investment. If given the option of NO STARs, I would have made that choice."
4,Does what it says.,"Followed the set up and operating instructions carefully, and it worked the way they said it would. No problems. But for the money, I thought it should have had an automatic tone arm return."
3,Save your money. Don't buy this one,The turntable works fine once setup correctly. It was no problem getting started immediately. The problem occurs with the audacity software included with the product. The software does not work as advertised. I could not get the noise out of the LP's using the audacity included with the turntable. Instead it seems you must purchase the retail version in order to effectively remove the noise.If you are buying to transfer LP's and require effective noise removal software don't waste your money on this one!
2,Costly :: few features !*!*!*!,"Well, it cost >$200 and I at least had a vision of a turntable that would start and stop :: in the automatic mode. Nope; it did not stop.. it did not start! It is all plastic and too expensive.The only reason that I kept it is that it has a *nice* visual design as far as components go. It has a dust cover and some adjustment features.The whole darn thing cost about $22 to manufacture or less. Do not buy this item.. go else where.. look for one made of metal or wood."
4,Turntable,I really haven't had enough time to fully explore the turntable but it seems to do what I want to do with my old LP records and the interface is really easy to follow. Just read the instruction carefully.
4,unopened,"i have not the chance to set up and test this item, but had to input a rating to close this review. Based on other users I am expecting the results to be similar and that's why I gave it a 4."
4,Almost Perfect,"Due to other perceived priorities it took me a few days before I assembled this, but it is worth it. My first project was to recover a 50-year old well worn performance of Shostakovitch's #10 by Mitropoulos. It really works, especially the Audacity clean-up application. Just follow the instructions. And herewith are my only carps. The Quick Start Owner's Manual is too brief. One discovers more instructions under the pull-down menus in the application, especially what all the different buttons and ""graphs"" do. The other minor problem is that the hole in the felt platter pad is too small for the spindle. Simply enlarge with a suitably graduated round pointed tool such as a punch."
2,How did everyone but me know it records background noise?,"Just got this as a gift. I'm not a big vinyl person but there are a few MJ albums I'd like to hear again. We recorded Thriller and hey, you can't help but sing along. Playing it back through the iPod and there is my voice and my husband's voice singing along. I just assumed it recorded through the needle or something! We were talking about when we were kids and wanted to use a ""recording device"" to record an LP and we had to yell at everyone in the house to shut up. Seems like technology hasn't really progressed that much! Bottom line - did we do something wrong? Is there a switch or a preference we didn't set correctly? Seems kinda wonky otherwise."
3,Shipping review,Charged $110.00 for item from TechNGnet and they charged me $152.00 for shipping. Couldn't confirm shipping cost prior to buy. Stinks to get ripped off during the holidays. Thanks a lot Amazon for having people like this selling on site. Might as well be Craigslist!!
2,Dismayed,"First reading the product description, I was excited to find someone else utilizing our country's ""wild gourd"". After looking at the cover of Macfarlane's book and reading the Amazon reviews, I was dismayed to find the description deceiving.This crafting book is NOT about ""wild gourd"", but the hardshell gourd, Lagenaria siceraria. The ONLY native gourd growing in this USA is the gourd called Buffalo Gourd or Coyote Gourd (coyote melon, chili coyote, wild gourd are also some common names,) scientific names -- Cucurbita foetidissima and C. digitata. How disappointing to find such an obvious blunder.Perhaps the author could do with some additional fact checking and botany lessons instead of so many crafting classes. I decided to rate with book with one extra star out of shear compassion."
5,Just what the DR ordered!!,"This is a beautiful collection of gourd art from the true masters, replete w/ useful suggestions, patterns, and instructions. THANK YOU!!!! Highly recommend to all levels of gourd crafters."
4,"Could be a little more detailed as far as ""how to"" not for the novice","Beautiful book, could be used as a coffee table item. I really am enjoyong the book. However I feel that it does not offer the level of learning tecniques that I had hoped for. Not for the beginner."
5,Best Fine Gourd Art Book Ever Published!!!!,"I had only made my first piece of gourd art in February of 2004 after spotting some gourd artists at a local woodcarving show here in Mesa, Arizona..... I threw up (literally ;-) a pretty sorry web site at the time but sure enough, 8 months later, I got a call from Mr. Dave McFarlane @(Sterling Publishing, NYNY.) He asked me if I wanted to be in this book and at first, I thought it was a joke!!!! It was for real and you see the results!!! If you ever winter in Arizona and want to take a class, look me up!!!! Thanks Dave!!!!!"
3,beyond the basics; gourd art,some great projects shown... mostly for inspiration... the directions were often not detailed enough to complete the project... no patterns... However I'm glad to have thebook
3,Poor excuse,That an author used the Lord's name in vain is a very poor excuse for a bad review. I'm sure your recycling bin is full.
1,Recycle Bin,"I'm taking this book to the recycle bin. He uses God's name in vain on page 3. There are better ways of getting your point across. It may be a really wonderful story, but I'm not willing to stomach that."
3,Mixed,The stuff on symmetry breaking was nice and the section on solitons was helpful. However I found the first couple of lectures so outdated as to be destructive to my understanding.
3,"atlast,info on x-men behind the scenes","It always eluded me as to how the X-men were on and off a sizzling bestselling comic book for the past twenty years.So what fuels this book is actually curiousity.'Cause it was always a wonder to me what was it that made x-men so diferent than other comics.Well,i still don't see what makes this a phenomenal chart-scorcher,but it will be a bit useful for aspiring artists and writers trying to break into the comic field."
1,Save Your Money -- Not What it Looks Like,"Careful with this one -- it's not the ""Greatest Hits Vol. 2"" that it looks like and is advertised on Amazon as being. This is a 1977 album called ""Platinum"" which is nothing more than some disco dribble, not the sort of rock and roll you normally associate with the Stampeders. I got snookered and spent my money on this dud. My advice: save your money and look for some other recording."
2,did not do as expected,I purchased this product after Dr Oz endorsed California Poppy as a pain reliever and sleep enhancer. I had little improvement in my joint pain which was the main reason I was trying this. Plain old Ibuprofen works much better. I will not be buying this again!
5,. Hoshino Ruri Vocals .,This is one of my most expensive CD but it's worth every penny! Not only is Ruri cute she has a great voice. This is a must for any Nadesico fan. I give it 5 stars!
1,Snapped in Half the First Time I Used It,I waited too long to open the box and now I can't return it. Anyone know of any glues that work well on marble?
3,BEDAZZLED,"I had problems with the region code, as it costs money to remove it. For some reason the movie only used part of the screen."
4,Bedazzled by the original!,"Far more droll than the re-make. Dudley Moore is well known, but Peter Cooke, Dudley's partner in comedy from the 60's, shines as the Great Deceiver. And who can pass up seeing Raquel Welch as Lust? To me, the Pop Star sequence is sublime and still rings true. In many ways the social comments are still fresh and relevent."
5,Classic Comedy,"Although not a Dudley Moore fan, this performance is of a great actor and not the later repeatative character in his more recent films. Mothers always warn to never make a deal with the devil; but this movie illustrates how everyone else can benefit from the situational humor created by such deals. This film has humor from quite subtle to outrageous. I still am amused by the same antics and many that I've missed in prior viewings. This is one of the few tapes I still watch. It is the only one shelved on my DVD rack."
3,Bedazzled,"Not Peter Cook at his best, although as a devil he showed potential- I bought it for Raquel who did perform well."
4,ITS A CAMEO GUYS,"As a whole this comedy doesn't really connect, but many funny moments make it a must see.Guys who want to see this for RAQUEL WELCH be patient ,you will see her bikini clad dancing for you ,but its only a cameo.This is a BRITISH comedy to be sure,the humour seems to function just like a painkiller.Don't miss RAQUEL!"
5,The best,"After years of searching for Bedazzled on video or DVD, I'm hoping that the remake will make the original available again. They just don't make adult comedy any better than this."
3,Speak of the Devil,"Bedazzled doesn't actually dazzle, though it's pretty good for its time. The title comes from a song central to one of the scenes, with DudleyMoore's character attempting the role of rock star. With typically understated British humor, Dudley sells his soul to the Devil (Peter Cook), who makes the most of his purchase by too literal interpretation of the wishes Dudley gets as his payoffs. Raquel Welch has a somewhat memorable but short role as Lust, one of the seven deadly sins. Of course, nothing really untoward is allowed to happen; it's all in fun. There is even a suitable ending, where Dudley gets to keep his soul after all, and the whole experience becomes a morality play in the tradition of English theater."
2,Dissenting view,"I see from the many favorable reviews that I'm an outlier on this movie, but I was unimpressed. The wishes were lame and poorly plotted. Raquel Welch was wasted. Dudley Moore's character was such a drip that it was hard not to cheer against him."
2,A DISSENTING OPINION.,"I bought this cuz it had such uniformly rave reviews, but I didn't like it at all. The premise is trite, and the execution is not particularly clever. Dudley Moore gets on my nerves."
5,Pleased with The New Jedi Order Sourcebook,"The New Jedi Order Sourcebook came in the condition in which it was described, no surprises. The book is in good condition, no torn or missing pages. The binding is good and the cover is good. The book arrived in a timely manner, no delays. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recomend using this site to anyone. Thank you for this book."
1,Disorganization a major obstacle,"All content aside, the organization of the book is its biggest flaw. Characters, vehicles and locations are scattered throughout the book, alomst hidden, unless one takes excessive time to scan he index, all of which becomes a hindrance to the flow of any game. Later books have the improved indexes (lesson learned?) that this book sorely needs."
4,Very good deep house offering,"More like 4.5 stars.So deep house has been commodified to the point that it's often no longer fun. I love naked music as much as the next guy, but some of their offerings are a bit bland, don't you think?This guy gets it though. Deep house is not about throwing a diva over 120 bpm, adding production values, and calling it a day. It's about real, gods-honest, genuine soul. And funk. Think DJ Deep, among others. Listen to ""CJs Theme"" and tell me Mr. Wyatt aint funky. nia please."
2,Warped and too flexible,"The Peachtree insert fits the saw fairly well, but other than that I didn't like mine at all.It isn't flat; it bellies down in the middle. As a result, the ends stick up and that creates issues when the stock hits the edge. I talked to Peachtree about it, and they just told me to bend it back until it is flat. Well, that sorta works... but after about 5 minutes the thing goes back to the original warped shape. The way they answered the question makes me think that lots of folks call about warped inserts.Also, there is a little bit of slop, both sideways as well as fore/aft.I replaced mine with a Leecraft CR-2. That one is made of phenolic so it is dead flat and stiff, and it fits much better."
2,Not a good fit,I am having to make significant modifications to this insert for it to fit my Craftsman Contractors saw. I would suggest that you provide Peachtree with a model number and let them verify that it will fit.
2,"Technically sound, but frightfully brief. A total rip off.","Appel does an moderate-to-poor job of describing the MACD trigger method and how to understand it. As the ""book"" is actually a pamphlet, the price is obsurd and outrageous. It left me feeling ripped off. I would not buy this book again. I am looking for a more thorough explanation in some other book."
2,Not Quite,"I purchased the Suchards Hot Chocolate for my Tassimo machine and to be honest it was a let-down after hearing all these positive reviews all over the net. The product has potential but I found it to be quite weak, with not enough chocolate taste. Suchard should increase the capsule size with more concentrated chocolate. I still feel Starbucks has a much better product in their stores (but your going to pay for it).I also found the drink to be of a much smaller size then the Cappucinos and Lattes that I have made in this machine."
3,Only Fair Hot Chocolate,"I bought this while waiting for my coffee order. I found it kind of weak, with an odd 'Salty' taste. I probably won't buy it again. I am hoping the coffee is better!"
2,OK not Great,I was hopeful this hot chocolate would be great tasting. Suchards...imported... sounded promising. But it leaves a lot to be desired. It is watery tasting and has an odd grainy consistency to it as well. I'd say pass on this.
1,Confusion at Amazon for products sold....,"Hello...I paid for this product on August 20. I was to receive the item between August 27th and Sept. 14th. Product never arrived. I emailed the vendor. The vendor indicated I should already have the product. I applied for a refund. Currently, Amazon may get the matter resolved by Oct. 2nd of this year.I finally got an email from the vendor telling me that they did not understand why they got a response for the sale of that printer server. They sold that item a year ago and the listing should have been removed from Amazon.If the vendor is truthful, then that means Amazon collected money for a product that was sold a year ago. And either Amazon or the vendor will be sitting on my money for about 6 or 7 weeks before I get my money refunded."
2,"Boring.. but it is really about his life,","Well, the writer really wrote about McGuire's life... in the first one hundred pages, we are overwhelmed by ""glorious"" tales of McGuire fishing with his friends, McGuire dating girls, McGuire having lunch and dinner, McGuire buying new clothes, McGuire playing clarinet at his school band, McGuire sleeping, McGuire buying a ring for his fiancée....Uau, utter boring!! Action only begins around page 170...But I must say that the tittle book let it be clar: THE LIFE OF MAJOR THOMAS B. McGUIRE. It's not "" THE WAR HISTORY OF MAJOR THOMAS B. MCGUIRE"". So, now you know what you're into for..."
2,Great.. from the middle towards the end....,"This book only takes off around the middle of it, when it focus in McGuire's war exploits. Then you can feel all his stress flying countless operations, his skill, his charisma, what his fellow pilots thought about him. The first half of the book is utterly boring."
5,An incredibly useful tea book,"My mother gave this book to me after learning of my newly developed love of tea, and it has been really helpful. It describes all the different kinds of tea and offers suggestions about which kinds to try, and has a tasty scone recipe as well as others I haven't tried yet. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone new to tea and wanting to learn more!"
2,My mistake,"I ordered this DVD under the impression that the copy of LA PERLA on the disk had English subtitles. I am not attempting to return it; my son has a friend that he can give it to.However, I would like to know if a subtitled version of this film does exist. Can you give me any information on that? And if there is such a version, can you name a source for me? Thank you for your attention to this request."
1,not a direct replacement,"I took the pump to the Chrysler dealer to have them install it because removing the assembly from the fuel tank required a special tool. Once they removed it the electrical connections were not compatable. I had buy a pump from them because they would not do ""jury rigging of electrical"" in the fuel tank.Python Injection, Inc. 747-227 Precision Remanufactured OEM Fuel Pump"
3,"OOOPS!! guess he`s wrong ""Hit the Road""","I hate to burst Christopher`s review on Hit the Road, but ""Hit the Road Jack"" which actually has a brief bit for the wolfman is not on this album. (never was).""Hit the Road Jack"" is on the album Steamin it was not, nor has it been ever released on Hit the Road. All one has to do is go to the stampeders web site and check there discography to verify this. Being from Canada and growing up with them I eagerly awaited every album and know them by heart.Although this was not one of there better albums a -0 rating is a little tough. They were trying a transistion at this time looking into horns and the such. IN fact it was shortly after this album Rich Dodson quit due to a musical differenc."
5,Excellent Biblical Perspective on Healing,"Jim does an excellent job of giving historical, Biblical information on healing as well as present-day thought. Especially our understanding of the word 'miracle'. He also explains discusses secular healing and Divine Healing, and some possible causes of disease in our lives. I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. I give it an A+. Thx, Jim, for all your efforts writing this book."
2,to much work,"I bought these 2 units off the TV add and it it wasn't so much trouble I would return them.. The ampunt of oversray with this is considerable and do't even think about using it indoors at all. Oh yes, don't let it accidently drop as the connector couplin breaks very easily."
5,"""Adios, Hollywood, My Story By Dick, Dog of Oaxaca As Told To Rose Leiman Goldemberg"".","""Adios, Hollywood, My Story By Dick, Dog of Oaxaca As Told To Rose Leiman Goldemberg"".It was one of the funniest and enjoyable reads I have had in a long time. Aside from the shear enjoyment of reading the story it stayed with as I got to understand what kind of place Hollywood can be. I think the use of a dog to tell the story of what happens to some if not most who want to be in the Hollywood scene was brilliant.I thank you for writing it and providing me with such meaningful fun, but hat happens to Dick next?"
4,Enjoyable Read for Me,"The ""Welshman's Way"" was my fourth book by this author and the fourth in the series of 14 books. I am now on book 5 and all of the stories so far a good,light romantic stories. They are not very racey. The love scenes are short and sweet for the most part. Nothing erotic in this series. The characters are very good. Not just the main characters but all of them.The nice thing is some of the characters show up in the other books in a very inventive way. Some of the characters turn out to be the main person in the next book. Good writing I guess you would say. So far I have really enjoyed the stories and each one has had a good and differnt plot. I am used to reading Berrice Smalls books that have very erotic love scenes. I wasn't sure if I would like this series but they are kind of refreshing but they could use a little more sexual romance. I have all 14 books and so far I have not read a bad or boring one."
3,An average read,"This book kind of plodded along, and I never really connected with any of the characters. It was about average for a romance, but one you only read once, and only because there's nothing else. I wouldn't pay any more than a dollar for it. Better to get it at the library."
2,BEWARE of Warranty!,"I purchased my Movado Amorosa Watch through Amazon less than only 4 months ago. It is a beautiful watch, but unfortunately the band just recently came apart at the hinge section just below where it mounts to the case. Local jewelers told me this must be repaired by an Authorized Movado Service Center as they were not able to repair it and it being a manufacturing defect. HOWEVER, due to it being purchased online through Amazon the manufacturer's warranty is VOID since it was not purchased through an authorized dealer. Amazon only offers a 30 day return, so now I have to pay to have the band serviced or replaced!!! BEWARE- basically you will only get a 30 day warrenty with any Movado purchase online!"
1,great until the warranty expired,"This watch is stunning and was my favorite out of all of the ones I've owned, but the warranty only lasts 2 years, and mine stopped working at 2 years 3 months. I was hoping it was just the battery, but it turned out to be the movement and the crown that were broken. My dealer sent it to Movado for me, and Movado wanted me to pay $220 to get it fixed. I think this is ridiculous, since it's only 3 months out of warranty and you'd expect a company as well known as Movado to stand by their products. Sadly, they don't."
3,Elegant and Simple,"I got this watch as a Mother's Day gift just few days ago from my husband. This watch was so beautifully presented in the box. I tried it on right away, and fell in love immediately.The only complain I have is that the wrist band seem to be too big for normal size. It is been adjusted to the smallest possible band size, and it still fits loose on my wrist."
5,Better than she ever Expected!!,This was a Christmas present for girlfriend. She was even more pleased than I could have imagined.
3,Movado,"Received this as scheduled; however, the box was damaged and the watch was not packed as I would expect. All in all I like the watch..."
4,Good Watch,"Looks fancier on the picture. Overall good watch, really happy with my purchase. It's Movado! Enough said. Could not give 5 stars, waiting for something out of ordinary..."
1,Horrible customer service,"I recenlty bought a Movado Pen at the local Movado store. The store closed down, the pen no longer works correclty after 6 months and Movado customer service keeps trying to send me to a 3rd party Pen vendor in NY. and I live in Bellevue WA. Customer service will take no action for the faulty pen, and I am stuck with a $200 pen that does not work."
3,Its not the best,I was expecting more information on the watch such as the warranty that I have with it and also how to get this resized. it is to big for the person I bought it for and can't really do much with it.
3,Women's Movado Amorosa Watch,"Nice watch, however, I bought this for my wife for Christmas, and herwrist is small, this watch won't fit a small wrist. It is better to buya watch with more links instead of a bracelet style watch."
5,Movado's are great,"My girlfriend has had this watch for a couple years now, I just saw that I should review the product. Movado is an awesome watch. I have had mine for 7 years and in many of rough environments and my watch still looks great. I only have changed the battery one time. So I got her one too and she loves it. Great product."
1,Requiring a signature for delivery...what world do you live in?,"I didn't receive the watch. When notified I had to be home to sign for it, I had UPS return it. Like most Americans, I work and I don't have the time to drive to a remote UPS center. It seems that during the ordering process the question could be asked about the preference for signing upon delivery."
4,Beatiful watch. Careful with wrist size.,"I bought this watch for my wife as a Christmas Gift. The watch is beautiful, very classy and usable with formal or casual clothing. But... we had only one problem that was a real bummer. We went to shorten the band and realized it didn't get as short as she needed to fit nice on her wrist. This is because of the band design that only allows a few links to be taken away. So if you are thinking about buying this model be aware of that. Although we had that problem I still think it's an excellent watch."
3,Good deal,"I bought this for my wife a year ago. It was retailing for 2x the amount at the jewelry stores, at about $500. The watch is very basic, clean and elegant. It's her dressy watch. Considering the price in retail stores, this is a steal."
4,Pastore's book for options...this book for ESPPs,"I disagree with the reviews on this site. Thomas's book is good but too encyclopedic covering options, estimated tax payments, employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs), mutual funds, gift and estate taxes, what a share of stock is, and more. There are 75-100 pages in this book covering basic material. This book and Pastore's are totally different....but buy both because presumably you've got real money at stake."
2,"Covers the basics, but not strategy or advice","This book is good in that it covers all the basic mechanics of stock options -- Incentive and Non-Qualified, and ESPP plans. However, this basic information can easily be found on the web or from your employer.What is sadly lacking from this book is advice on strategy on how to manage options, e.g., ideas on when to exercise and sell. Because of this, the book is quite disappointing to me and not very useful."
4,Consider Your Options,"Mr. Thomas knows how to lay your options out in plain, simple English. He has an effective and informative style that makes sense of gobbledeygook. After thousands of dollars in legal and accounting fees these were the first straight answers I have been given to the questions and scenarios I am struggling with. Well worth the price of the book. Options are nothing to screw around with. The IRS seems to have targeted this form of comp for their most evil form of torturous logic. Make an informed decision, read this book."
3,For the very lay person...,"Don't know much about options? Here is the book for you. Simply written, not verbose, and will likely cover anything you have questions about."
4,Imagining the Shadow World,"There are things going on in the Shadow World, where spirits war, beyond anyone's imagination. Theodore Beale uses his to create an engaging tale of what invisible spiritual warfare might be like in the halls, parties, and coffeeshops frequented by Minnesota high school youth. We might not all have opportunities to interact quite so personally with the likes of Melusine and Paulus as do the human protagonists of this book--nor am I really sure we would want to. Nevertheless, there is a lesson in practical Christianity here that can be carried away: the ""path of least resistance"", the turning of a blind eye on those who suffer cruelty, has serious consequences, even eternal consequences. Wage spiritual war by loving someone today."
5,amazingly real,"this book was better than the first. without a single doubt. It brought the spiritual war to Earth, where it indeed is being fought daily. Although ficticious, it gave a real perspective on daily life. Showing the overall influence of the war on everyday life. How most of us are blinf to the fact that we are being used. The way Kaym used Brien and Derek, without them even knowing until the end.The war we fight with our sin is influenced. and Mr.Beale put it into a gravley real perspective, how the Fallen can use just a bit of hatred and sin to create a mass problem."
5,Dust collector bags,"Good bags, fit was right on. They seem to be as good as the OEM bags. I would recommend These to anyone looking for an alternative source."
4,Twins' delight,"Haven't actually seen this toy as it was sent to my grandchildren, so my response is based on their mother's comments which may be grandparent biased!"
2,Too few pieces for the price.,"We received these blocks as a gift for my twin boys. When we received it, I didn't even remove the shrink wrap and returned it. The pieces were SO small (square blocks are hardly 1 1/2 inch wide), and there were SO few of them, especially for the price this set is. So, on the picture, if you count the blocks that are visible in the box window - that's it - there aren't any more. Sure the quality seems great, but they are simply painted wooden blocks. Even if the paint is non-toxic, I still don't want my boys to eat it (and their little sharp teeth get anything!). I'll be buying a simple set of unpainted wooden blocks (which I can find sets with way more blocks for the same price) and let my boys use their imagination like I did when I was growing up ;). Hope this is helpful... I was just very dissapointed with this one and we've purchased other Haba toys which are awesome (like theHaba Walker Wagon- IT'S GREAT!). But this toy - I would not recommend to anyone."
5,My son loves these blocks,"The blocks are great. My 1-year old son loves them -- the blocks are the first thing he goes for in the morning. Well designed, made in Germany, non-toxic... what else do you need to know?"
4,Very good blocks,"My 12-month old daughter loves these almost as much as DUPLOs.They are almost all wooden (except the transparent one). My daughter has been chewing on them for the last couple of months and I didn't see any chips of wood or cracks in paint - this speaks quality.Why 4/5 stars? I now it's dumb - but there are so few blocks - I know, I should have read the description, but I was expecting more for the price paid. So 1 star off for the price per block."
5,Best blocks ever,"We have had these blocks for over 2 years and absolutely love them. They are so adorable and the different colors and shapes allow for so much creativity. They are very durable, there has been no color chipping or fading after two years of being played with on hardwood floors. There was one roundish piece that my son put in his mouth, and it seemed like quite a choking hazard (it fit all the way in his mouth) so we removed that one, but otherwise, we love these blocks. We bought another colorful Haba set and mixed the two. Great purchase."
4,A great toy that will provide countless hours of fun for the child,"I was looking for a toy that was safe, and provide a lot of entertainment for the child. I bought this one as a present. I have been buying this series of toys so that the child can build on it. This fits the bilHaba Fantasy Blocksl."
5,Best blocks EVER!!,"My son got these off his wishlist for his 1st birthday and has loved them ever since! Bold colors, fantastic shapes and quirky/cool special touches. The block with a bell inside is a hit! Haba makes wonderful toys and this is no exception."
4,Love the blocks but beware of smaller pieces,"My son loves the blocks. The look like no other blocks and he gets a kick out of the block with the bell inside and the clear plastic blocks that look like ice cubes. To my horror, he can put a few of the smaller ones entirely into his mouth so I took them away so he can play with when he's older. Watch out for this if you buy these wonderful blocks."
5,We all love these blocks!,"I purchased these blocks for my daughter's first christmas. She was 9 months old at the time. She has gotten tremendous use out of these. At first we would play with her while using these as there are two small half circle blocks, but overall, the blocks are a good size for toddlers. She is now almost 3 years old and I am looking to add another set to our collection this christmas. These are wonderful for the imagination and ours are used daily and they still look brand new! Love Haba!"
2,disappointing,too fast to learn and the signs are difficult to understand and I am intermediate in ASL. Their other Christmas DVD is great so I am real disappointed
1,Elliot Goldenthal is Brilliant,"This is an awesome soundtrack and you'd be missing out if you did not buy it. Also if you liked this soundtrack try Elliot Goldenthal's soundtrack to ""Interview with the Vampire"". It is amazing; he really captures the dark and passionate nature of vampires."
2,Nearly unlistenable,"I truly believe there are two types of film scores; those that can be listened by themselves, and those that need to accompany a film to be listened to. 'Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within' definately needs to be lumped into the latter category. Being a big fan of the music composed for the FF games, I was really anticipating this CD. Being familiar with only Goldenthal's work with the last Batman films, I was prepared to give the guy an open ear. I wish now I had closed it. This score is noisy and brash, with absolutely no melody whatsoever. There are lots of loud instruments blurting away, clanging cymbals and hollering wind instruments all alike. There is no one leading theme or melody to latch onto to set this score apart from the others. I believe the soundtrack to a film should be a part of that film's character, but this one is a faceless mess. The only thing to even closely redeem it was the second last vocal track. FF fans, don't be duped into buying this."
5,Great CD,"This is a nice and emotional CD. But there is something that buged me the most. Alot of Reveiwers said that the last track,""the Spirits Dreams Inside"" was a waste. I LOVE THAT SONG! Infact, right now that is my most favorite song in the world. And I have to say, that is a very cool song. L'Arc~En~Ciel is a good band, and will always be. And for some of you who don't know, the main singer that sang most of it was Hyde. So back off of that song, it rocks"
4,The Dream Within is a Great Song!,"The ending song by Lara Fabian is the main reason I bought this CD, and I wasn't disappointed. However, I feel the rest of the album falls short of a good buy, as it's seldom very melodic and not very easy to listen to all in one go. The variety can be a welcome change when you get tired of evil phantom tracks, but overall I'd say there are better soundtracks out there. Still, wow, what a great end song..."
4,Very evocative,"As one of the rare people on the planet who actually loved this movie, I also liked the soundtrack as it was very evocative. ""The dream within"" is a beautiful song and ""The Kiss"" is very romantic and successfully conveys the very touching moment between Gray and Aki."
5,The General,The General is an Excellent movie. Sure to become a classic in Irish cinema.Brendan Gleeson is a great character actor.
2,"Boring and, well, inertly comic","This movie is like a soup whose ingredients are so good that you can't miss, and yet it comes out bland as dishwater. It's a true and incredible story, masterfully photographed, well acted, lots of great Irish accents, and.... it's boring as hell. It might have come out okay if Boorman had added pathos, but he only goes for humor (like the movie Robin Hood), and it plays so forced that it comes across as desperate and callous (to Cahill's victims). I love just about everything Irish, but this movie was impossibly boring, and its humor was forced."
2,Sleazy guy featured in well-done portrayal,"This guy was simply too sleazy for words! The film seemed to romanticize, or at least to want the viewer to admire, this Irish mafia dude. His behavior was simply reprehensible, especially in his off-handed manner toward his wife and sister-in-law (both of whom he was openly sexually involved with) and with his protecting one of his ""employees"" who admitted to sexually abusing his own daughter. The movie DID hold my interest, but I was actually relieved when the General was shot to death at the end of the film."
1,"One of the best films of the year, terrible dvd.","This was the second best film of the year, and certainly the most beautifully photographed in widescreen black and white. Just don't expect that from the DVD. It contains two versions black and white and a ""desaturated color version."" The black and white version is shown 1.85:1, not the original 2.35:1. The color version was obviously done on a computer, with some footage in color, while most is still in black and white. You would think you could solve the problem by turning off the color on your t.v. pre-sets, but it turns out the only available audio has all obscenities dubbed out, like on network television. Save your money untill Columbia represses the disc."
4,Colorful Portrait of a Unique Criminal,"This is a gritty, human tale told with irony, humor and more than a little violence. Gleeson is great in the title role. I can't help but wonder, however, which version the director initially intended to be seen theatrically: the black and white (which, incidentally, is presented in a 1.85:1 ratio, rather than the advertised 2.35:1) or the desaturated color version (which is 2.35:1)?"
3,Somewhat Interesting -,"'The General"" is a biographical portrait of Irish crime boss Martin Cahill. The film opens with him being assassinated outside his home, followed by a summary of his prior life. Cahill began his life of crime as a youngster - stealing food for his family, and never stopped stealing, even while living on the dole with his wife and children and after having committed a major jewel robbery. The problem with the film is that it is difficult to avoid becoming disgusted with Cahill's character - you wish he had turned to a productive life.Eventually Cahill's cohorts tire of the non-stop life of crime, or are picked up. Cahill also antagonizes the IRA, though the movie doesn't explain why. Presumably it was the IRA that ended Cahill's life, sparing the hapless police further embarrassment."
4,Awesom and first of its kind,This film is the first of its kind for 'baby-boomers'. Awesome. Loved Benson amd DeVito.
2,Only the truly strong might bear it,"Modern Love.People who went to the University of South Carolina or who lived in Columbia, S.C. might like the scenery. It is an homage to USC and Columbia locales, using some years before they appeared in Hootie and the Blowfish vidoes, such as the DMZ neighborhood under the water tower.The scene on The Horseshoe might bring a tear to a USC alumnus' eye, but otherwise, not much to it.."
3,wrinkled poster,The poster arrived quickly but it was wrinkled. It wasn't worth returning so I kept it and it smoothed out almost all the way when I put it in a frame. Still ... disappointing.
2,Dated material,"This stuff may have been good back in the day, but it is sub par for todays standards . This stuff is AGRESSIVE! There is actual grit within the compound. I dont see many applications of this product. Other than the fact that it is cheap i would avoid it. Meguiars has much better products out there for severe to moderate defects."
2,Writing for the audience of oneself,"Mr Zinik's work is not destined for ""the masses"" and I don't think he really wants it to be enjoyed by too many. The use of the languare is so sofisticated that sometimes one wanders how the author with all those complicated words manages not to get wherever he wanted to get initially. Couple of stories are amusing but too long (for the content) and most of them are promising at start and dissapointing at the end. I would not recommend buying this book unless you are particularly interested in the mindset of intellectualised Russian intelligencia that is trying to meet ends in England and is unhappy about everything."
4,compelling story,"I had read Geraldine McCaughrean's ""The White Darkness"" and loved her writing style, so thought I would try another of her books. I can recommend this to all readers aged 12 (or there abouts) and up. (And up and up ... I am 45!)The characters are fun and interesting, especially the fascinating MCC Berkshire; and one feels a certain empathy for the adolescent Ailsa, trapped in a boring life with her widowed Mother, helping out at the family shop.Ailsa meets the strange Mr Berkshire whilst doing work experience at her local library. He is in need of employment and a place to stay. Her mother is in need of someone to help in the shop. And it appears that MCC, though unorthodox in his methods, is able to sell almost anything.I found the book very easy to read, and the ""stories within the story"" compelling.A great book with a very neat little twist at the end."
5,A Great Piece of My Childhood....,"This book is so wonderful for young minds. For me it was a hallmark of my youth - I re-read it again and again over the years, always surprised by how captivating it was. It nurtures the idea that young people should have imaginations that they sometimes forget are not ""real."" We should allow children to be children and enjoying a good story is the ultimate way to remain young at heart! I think everyone should read it - I still do every few years to remind myself to be hopeful!"
1,unorganized,"This book is poorly written. Ideas are vague and never expanded to completion. Ziker seems adept at starting one topic, and then branching off into so many other aspects that one gets lost and is unable to follow the original point of the discussion. I never got a feel for the people or their lifestyle except for the rare generalized glimpses that Ziker offers into their basic behavior. For a man that lived among these people, he doesn't leave the impression that he got to know them at all. Unless this is required text I would pass."
2,"Good material, but bad value","I hold this to be a good book on the subject of informal logic, but the value is rather poor. The reason for this is that much of the book is merely reiterating what was said on the subject in Irving Copi's ""Introduction to Logic"". What makes this really bad, is that ""Introduction to Logic"" costs more or less the same as this, and covers a lot more ground. Do not buy this book!! Buy ""Introduction to Logic"" instead, for its value is much better than this one, and will teach you all that this one will and more."
1,Poor Value,"As an earlier reviewer noted, this book contains only a third of Copi's Introduction to Logic yet it costs almost as much.There is nothing here that can't be found in Introduction to Logic. This is just another example of publishers repackaging old stuff and selling it at a premium, in an attempt to rip off college students.If you want to learn logic, get Copi and Cohen's Introduction to Logic.And unless you are taking a course and thus need to do the exercises in the latest edition, save money by buying a cheap used copy of the previous edition."
1,"Too Pricey, No Better Than Cheaper Books.","I with agree most of the others here. This book is way too expensive for what it offers. I had to use it for a logic class three years ago. It's okay, as far as it goes, but the price is ridiculously high. There are several equally good informal logic texts that cost only 1/4 what this one costs. Save your money and get one of the cheaper books. (Howard Kahane is good.)"
5,Absolutely fabulous,"It's the best book I ever read. I felt like the author had been looking over my shoulder at some of the events that have happend in my own life - I really related to the main character, Victoria. I believe it should stimulate others to think about their own past lives. I think everyone should take this journey."
3,Lighthearthed Family TV,"Scarecrow and Mrs. King was not an award winning drama show, but it was good fun for the whole family and is child friendly. Mrs. King is an average homemaker and mother of two boys, who accidentally becomes involved with a spy (Scarecrow). She eventually becomes a real agent and always gets them into trouble. Btw, Bruce Boxleitner is a pleasure to look at!"
3,a long wait for not enough,"Having read the book and enjoyed the vhs version of this story, I was very happy to hear that it was available on dvd--but it has no extras AT ALL.Movie starts immediately after you push the play button..thought it would at least have a little background on the story, or the stars, or something. Most movies that are released on dvd several years after the initial release do have a little extraadded...but not this one, and it was a fairly high price at $19.98, no closed captioning, either. I guess I should have read the promo a little more closely to see exactly what I was getting. I don't regret having it on dvd but just wish there were a little more to enjoy.."
5,"Great Southern Tale of love, life, and great humor.","I absoulutely love this movie, I see it all the time on Romance Classics Channel; it just so entertaining and real!! See it and you will not be dissapointed!!!"
4,"Joel's Comments for ""Rich in Love""","Easy to watch interesting movie. Anyone who remembers the pre Hugo Charleston will love this movie. Pictures of the old Cooper River Bridges, East Bay Street and Market area are priceless. It brings back old memories of a changed Charleston after hurrican Hugo. A must see for Charleston buffs."
2,Constantine is a Zionist/Communist Apologist,I was disappointed in this book because it atttibutes all evil to the Nazi branch of the Illuminati without any reference to the Zionist Communist branch. The tips offs are 1) He defends an acknowledged Communist spy Harry Dexter White as a true patriot. He retails the lie that James Forrestal committed suicide. Don't waste your money on this book.
4,Love me some blue-eyed soul,"Crosby Tyler! It's your old friend from the swap meet circuit, Doug. I sold you a few records back in the day. I never knew you could really sing - black canary indeed. You always had that sly grin, like you had something up your sleeve. You were grinning because you knew you had a ticket out, your god-given talent. Much love and congratulations for living your dream."
5,CARY GRANT :Dark Angel by Geoffrey Wansell,"I found this book to be a wonderful insight into the glorious life of Cary Grant....many have said it before ,however the combination of wonderful photographs and truthful respectfulwording makes this a must for Cary Grant Fans ....just great!!!"
2,Too Many Inconsistencies,"As a person who studied with students of and later Peng Jui Ling himself (continuing to Luo Han Gong, Kongjing Qigong and the Poison Hand techniques), the man who is supposedly the source of the information of this book, I would like to take issue with the content. When I studied this form (taught by Master Peng as One finger Zen, also known elsewhere in the world as One Finger Art and Yihizi Chan Qigong), I was given his notes and I find many inconsistencies from notes to book, one of the most glaring the amount of time bending each finger, which is actually the core of this form. I would suggest this book be used as an introductory primer for someone considering taking one Master Peng's courses with either him or an instructor recommended by him, not as a substitute for actual instruction."
1,"9 Inch Pan, NOT 12""",Expected to receive a 12 inch pan and received a 9 inch pan. I returned it and it took them like two months to refund me.
4,Great induction use!,Basic all 'round pan - works very well (& at a fair price!) on an induction burner !
2,Not bad...but not great,"This stand isn't too bad for the price. The main problem with the stand is that it wobbles, and there isn't anything to stop the shaft from coming out of the base when lifted. All in all, useful but not terribly well put together."
5,Rolling with my Bro.,"What a weird and lovely mix of music! This is easily my favorite of all the Katamari games' soundtracks. My brother and I used to play this game together so much that in a way we've bonded over it. Besides, I've been getting these songs stuck in my head years after playing this game, and I finally decided to get this OST. I'm very happy to hear these nostalgic songs whenever I want now."
5,this IS the soundtrack,"One reviewer claimed that this is not the soundtrack to We Love Katamari, but that is incorrect. This does contain all of the crazy songs from the game - same versions, original performances. Lots of fun! A few instrumentals are also contained."
4,"Good, not great","This soudtrack to the sequel to Katamari Damacy, We Love Katamari, contains good tunes. This soundtrack is not as inspired as the soundtrack to Katamari Damacy was. Not to say that there is nothing good here - Track 6, Everlasting Love, track 7, Tsuyogari Katamari and track 14, Disco * Prince don't loose much when not listened to in game. Same thing for track 4, Katamari on the Swing to a lesser degree. Some of the other tracks are way out there without the context of the game around them. That's OK, though, this is Katamari Damacy, it's SUPPOSED to be whacked!"
2,NOT THE GAME SOUNDTRACK,"Don't make the same mistake I did and assume this is the soundtrack from the Katamari game. Instead, it's a bunch of covers of those songs, done horribly wacked out (in my opinion)."
4,Understanding Enterprise SOA,"Understanding Enterprise SOA is a book of choice; it uncovers the reality fact that SOA is the emergent wave of current technology. Through real case studies from the industry, the book holds a simple way of presenting the core of the enterprise SOA trend to the business people and the IT professionals, showing how much changes will be there crossing the fields of B2B, Business process management, real-time operations, and enterprise software development in general. The book goes on two tracks to achieve its goal of realizing enterprise SOA; Technology and People. Chapter 4 introduces the concept of SOA in an easy way, on the other track (part 2) chapter 14 introduce a (Four P's), which is a suggested process of a four stages for the best practices in enterprise SOA. This book has really put some focused lights across the SOA area."
1,A used-car-salesman's book on SOA,"Just about every technology cliché' out there is used in the ""used-car-salesman's"" version of a book on SOA (sorry if I offend any used car salesman here). The argument here is that SOA solves every ill. Not true. Only good, sound, application of the proper technology where it is needed will do that, not SOA alone. These guys could have written a great book if they had only refrained from hyperbole."
1,managers only,"I'm amazed this book received so many good reviews, the only reason I can see is that the reviewers are all Managers or it's a sign of a skewed process.Anyway the books own description should give it away ""Intended for both business people and technologists"". What are the chances of that being true? I'd say none.Basically this is a Managers book with all the consultant doublespeak you'd expect. It's written from such a high level it will give you nose bleed and makes tons of assumptions that only a Manager would buy into. If you are a techie and buy this book you will waste your time at best and learn misleading/incorrect info at worse."
3,Not what was described,"The description didn't say timed release, which is what I got. Totally not what I wanted or what was described but also not worth exchanging. I do like Melatonin (have used it for a few years to help me get to sleep) and Source Naturals is my brand of choice, I just didn't want timed release."
3,fun and cute,"Hi well to start this is sooooooo cute!!!!! It might not come with a doll but who cares? Anyway the animals look cute but the cat looks like a dog but it still looks cute. Anyway it comes with a lap top computer, a phone, an I.V., stick on bandages, a carrying case, and a whole lot more witch I don't have time to tell you about. So overall it's very fun so go out and get it for your kid well time for bed hope this was helpful L.O.L. Brooke."
5,Read it in one day,"I could not put this down and read it in one day. I have not read any of the author's other books. I looked up on the web a list of scottish romances and the title caught my eye. After reading the reviews, I thought to take a chance and was not disappointed, except I am not one for graphic love scenes and this romance had plenty. Other than that, it was cute and I liked it. Feel free to buy it if scottish romances catch your fancy."
5,10 plus stars - Read this Series!!!!,"If you never read a series, read this one, AND READ IT IN ORDER!! Kinley is sensational and truly the best author ever. All of the characters are outstanding - REAL MEN, and the women are strong minded, not weak and submissive. I can not wait until the next book comes out. I am looking forward to learning about Kieren and meeting Lochlan's bride to be. PLEASE hurry and publish them!"
4,Not as good as Born In Sin,"I enjoyed reading this book. I had a bit of a problem with the hero's stupidity, he was likeable and everything but he was just plain dense especially before the ending. The heroine was the redeeming quality of this book, she was a fun character to read, like a breath of fresh air. I get sick and tired of heroines who are so plain stubborn (""No, no no I can't do this! It's wrong!""...while she pants in heat, the heroine tells the hero the same thing-yada yada yada...repeatedly, until the end or middle of the book she finally gives in) that it gets old, boring and stale. The other characters in the book including the brothers were fun to read about as well. The plot was a bit too slow for me but all in all, it was a good book. I can't wait for Kierens' story! I do hope the next story is about Kieren instead of Lochlan because the ending of the series would be greater if the leader of the clan be the last to find true love. That would be a neat package!"
5,Awesome! Sexy and emotional at the same time.,This was my first Kinley read. I was NOT disappointed. The characters are well-rounded and the story line was interesting and relevant to the romance.The love scenes were hot and yet there was still enough romance to make this a touching and emotional story. I actually found myself tearing up at times!I give this 5 stars.
2,Bit of fluff,"Is it just me? With each succeeding book, Kinley MacGregor/Sherilyn Kenyon's writing skills seem to be dwindling. I enjoyed the first book of this series (and enjoyed her first Dark Hunter: Fantasy Lover, too), but with this book (and with the Dark Hunter book, Night Embrace) I could barely read a page without finding something juvenile or anachronistic that pulled me right back out. It seemed to be written quickly, and doesn't stand up to previous books in the series in content or flow.This story is slightly amusing (I enjoyed the heroine - her quirky talkativeness was fresh and fun), and readers who are following this series will want to read it just to keep up with the family, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone looking for a well-crafted story."
2,Shallow & lackluster,"I checked this book out thinking that it was something akin to Georgette Heyer's work... Big mistake. This was trashy, degrading and a big waste of my time. MacGregor loves to write about male arousal, I'll say that much. Again and again, she felt compelled to tell us that her male hero was excited... (Do we really need to know that?)In the hands of an author that could manage to get her mind out of the bedroom and describe more than just the sexual yearnings and exploits of her characters, this could've been a really fun read. (There was a bit of plot in there somewhere... And a smattering of charming dialogue.) As it was, this one turned me off of all her books.No matter what alias she tacks to the cover."
4,Same story structure,"The story structure is pretty much the same as any other of this series. Male lead character had an terrible life; believes himself to be unlovable and undeserving. In comes female (virgin of course) lead character. First both characters clash and can't stand each other. Stuff happens and they have sex and fall in love after 5 seconds of meeting each other. Not bad writing, but very predictable."
2,Predictable,"I really like these kinds of romance novels. Particularly novels set in Scottland, which was why I bought this book. Unfortunately, this book did not live up to my expectations at all. It was incredibly predictable and I felt, written poorly. So much so, that I stopped reading it mid-way through the book. I almost never, ever do that as most times I want to finish the book to see if it either gets better, or see how it ends. This book also seemed insulting to women in general as it goes on and on about how much the young woman in the story talks; as if women can't help but ""blather on about things."" I probably won't buy another Kinley MacGregor novel after this. I hate to spend the money and be totally dissatisfied."
4,Meeting a man in a cave,"I was reading a preview of the first chapter of this book and was hooked. I had to buy it. It started with the woman entering a cave and seeing a man, naked and sprawled out on a bed. No slow lead up. Just jump right in. I liked the idea of it and decided to go ahead and get the book. I am glad I did. Now I am anxious to read all of the MacAllister books by Kinley MacGregor. I will definitely keep this book."
2,A Let Down,"After reading the entertaining ""Master of Desire"", I expected far more than I got from ""Taming the Scotsman"". Although there were parts of the story that held my interest, I found myself skipping tons and tons of pages of sexual play and the characters rehashing their emotional problems, trying to get back to the thread of the story. It seems to me the story should be the foundation and the sexual tension and emotional second guessing should be secondary, not primary. Highly disappointing."
2,Send in the second-stringers! MGM's bench warmers.,"Clearly Metro went to the well once too often to fetch this second-rate complilation of supposed ""magical musical moments"" from the studio's storied past. No matter how you slice it Ann Miller, Debbie Reynolds, Howard Keel, Donald O'Connor or Cyd Charisse just can't hold a candle to Garland, Kelly or Astaire. And how many times must we hear how much Mickey Rooney still misses Judy Garland? He covered his undying devotion much more eloquently twenty years earlier in Part 1. Get grief therapy, Mick. On that note, the film only comes to life when discarded footage of Garland in ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and ""Easter Parade"" is highlighted. It only serves to remind viewers that out-takes of Judy is infinitely better than intact numbers from the rest of the sub-par cast. The next time MGM has a garage sale of its film vaults, they should at least have more to offer than the ""dollar table"" items."
3,Disappointed,"I love musicals and thought from the advertising I would get to see some really good stuff on this video. Much of it wasn't interesting at all, though I did love the stuff about Marilyn Monroe. If you are more interested in the history of musicals than the musicals themselves, then this might be a good buy. otherwise you will be disappointed."
5,Thanks!,"Thanks so much, this was a gift for my boyfriend and he has not put it down! Thanks great purchase!"
4,Good review,"I read this book before appearing on Wheel. This book has a few letter association tips that can help you some puzzles faster. Some of the information is outdated as far as how the show is played, but it does give you a lot of practice puzzles in the various categories to do before your big day. I won about $11,000 with a trip to Belize! It surely couldn't hurt your chances of winning at the Wheel."
5,Great product!,"This product arrived in a timely manner, it was easy to install and worked perfectly. It was a great product and fixed the problem we were having with our computer."
1,Stopped Working After 1-day,"Was very excited about this watch until it arrived. The watch and band were of cheap quality. Not anywhere near the price paid. Put it into use anyway since we had a need for it. After 1-day the ""C"" button stopped working. Therefore, we could no longer set the time, date, or the various alarms, rendering the watch useless to us."
3,At least it comes with a wallet,It barely survived the school year. The bottom support broke quickly. It's not durable enough for young kids who get a little wild on the way home from the bus stop.
3,erotica that's not too embarrassing to read!,"I enjoyed this book much more than I expected to - it was not written in the vein of ""The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty"" which embarrassed me somewhat - but was exciting and enticing without being graphic. The characters were so real that I felt close to them, almost as if I were part of the story, which drew me in so that I could not put this book down! I finished it in one sitting, staying up until 3am! Very enchanting, well worth it - a good read!"
1,poor quality,"put this in a brand new fitting, which i seldom use. Since buying Ive probably used the light for 5 hours in total and thats as long as the bulb lasted. Waste of money and the resources to make it."
2,bulbrite bulb,It's possible these products don't work properly with Australian conditions. The bulb blew within hours and made an unusual noise within minutes. Would be fine if it worked.
2,Hmmm...waited so long for what?,"First, I LOVED the movie GREASE so it's fair to say that I really wanted this doll. I bought 2, one the debox and one to admire on the shelf. Two problems...the outfit is SEWN on to the doll and she is practically bald in the back. Not much fun there, when you can't redress and she needs a weave. Needless to say I RETURNED the one I hadn't deboxed for a refund. Not worth the [money]!"
5,"If you loved Grease, you will love displaying this figure!","This is a great figure. Beautiful work. Just like in the movie. Comes in a really nice display-styled box with a movie-themed box and appropriate background, so if you prefer to keep her shut, she is just as good for a display piece. This is definately one to invest in!"
2,For Beginners Only,"If you know a tripod will add stability to your camera, that a larger negative (say 4""x5"") contains more information than a 35mm negative, and such sage advice, save your money. Instead consider a book by Galen Rowell or John Shaw. This book belabors the obvious for all but a beginner or the beginning intermediate photographer. Actually expected much more from this writer. But if you are a beginner, go for it. A good photo guide from Kodak or National Geographic will contain more useful information. His adulation of a particular brand on 35mm camera (Yahica/Contax)gets in the way of the reader in this writer's opinion."
1,the picture shown is not what you get,"You really shouldn't show the picture of the genuine HP cartridges when the seller sends you a knock off that doesn't work as well. This is false advertising! You can't show a picture of something and sell something else! And there was nothing said about getting a knock-off product. If you're looking for ink for ur inkjet, don't get it here.. it may be cheap, but it's not the real thing, and it doesn't work well. every few times i print i get these ugly streaks and i have to print over again."
3,"Don't even think of clicking ""used"" button! Buy only ""NEW""","Don't even think of clicking the ""used"" button; you'll be sorry. When it comes to so-called ""remanufactured"" cartridges especially for HP inkjet printers, don't take the chance. The ""used"" cartridge doesn't last as long, there's a possibility that the cartridge may explode, rendering your printer useless, and probably you'll void the warrenty on the printer. Don't be deceived, buy only ""new"" for HP printers (especially because the head is in the print cartridge.) Also a note to the Amazon people: Don't show a picture of a twin pack for the ""used"" product, because that's not what your getting in the mail if you buy it."
1,One cartridge already half empty?,"I just opened a new pack of these and the first cartridge I took out of the two-pack appears already half empty. This was from a sealed plastic carton bought new. I noticed writing on the package of install before AUG 2005 so I have almost a year before they ""expire"". The indicator was half green and half black so I assume I got a cartridge only half full. Out of curiosity I opened the second cartridge and found that its indicator was entirely green meaning it was OK. So, being that I only got 3/4 of the ink I paid for I have to give it a 1 star."
3,"Good Quality, But Why So Expensive?","...On the plus side, HP has improved the design of the cartridges so they do not gum up as bad as they once did. Years ago, I had a HP 660CSE printer, and the cartridges were notorious for gumming up. My current 932C works great with these cartridges.In a nutshell, this is a good quality cartridge but still not a good value for the money. Even though you can save a few bucks by buying the twin pack I am tempted to try cartridges from aftermarket manufacturers, or even refill kits."
2,CAUTION!,Did not even try it. It contains peanut oil as the second ingrediant! I bought it because it was almond and did not say anything about having a peanut product in it. Use caution! My significant other is deathly allergic to anything wtih peanuts. I could have killed her!
2,wrong stuff to get,"you have to be careful with these products. its not organic, and its not raw nut butter.roasting ANY nut (or anything, for that matter) destroys the nutrients which should be why youre eating this in the first place. the organic factor isnt as big of a deal, but why buy something with pesticides if you can buy organically grown? youre already shelling out 8 bucks for 3/4 lbs.get the maranatha raw organic nut butter. its the second best ive enjoyed (the other brand isnt available on amazon)."
1,Palm Springs Confidential: Playground of the Stars,"Is a complete waste of time. It reads (and looks) like a bad copy of the National Enquirer, but in a better cover.I've already recycled my copy."
5,Used Book Purchase,"I ordered this book as used and it was was rated in good condition. I don't know what the scale is exactly but, when I received it I was amazed that it looked and felt like it just came from the publisher's printing room. Excellent, excellent condition. Thanks again Amazon."
2,Boring and predictable,"There is nothing new nor interesting in this book. Liberace was gay. Really? Gosh, I didn't know that. Sinatra could be mean. Who'd a thunk? People had parties at their houses where lord only knows what went on because the parties were on private property. Oh, heaven forbid. At least some of the photos were nice."
3,Okay; doesn't fit many parts,"The design of this rack is very appealing, however it isn't as versatile as some of the reviews I read say that it is. I still haven't figured out how to make good use of the middle level of the rack. I end up throwing everything in the top part with bottles and pump pieces hanging off the prongs, but nipples and smaller pump parts get buried in the center and are hard to dig out without taking everything off the prongs.I really liked the idea of the brush holder in the middle because without it, I never know where to store the bottle brush and keep it sanitary, however it doesn't fit any other brush that I've purchased and I like to replace the brush from time to time.One thing that I do really like is that it comes apart easily and all pieces are dishwasher safe."
3,Useful,"The Translucent color of this bottle dryer looks a little yellowish in its actual product. Images and photos of this product as shown on Amazon are not close to the actual product.I would recommend interested buyer to go for the White color instead.Overall, the product is useful."
2,Brush Broke,"After three weeks my brush broke too! Cannot find a replacement, I do not want to buy a whole new rack. Design fault that they should correct. Not good enough"
4,Works well and looks nice,"The reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars is that it would be perfect if I used the skinny bottles (like the Gerber ones) but I use the Tommee Tippee line, which are a bit wider. Fitting bottles and the nipples on here is a tight squeeze. Also, the brush that it comes with isn't very high quality, which isn't surprising. I wound up throwing it away after using it a few times because I didn't like the idea of a dirty/used bottle brush living so close to the baby's clean bottles. So now the rack isn't as cute with the little orange bottle brush handle sticking up. However, removing the handle did make it shorter so now it can live on top of my microwave (that lives on the counter under a cupboard).Overall, it serves its purpose well and is better looking than bottle drying racks that I've seen at my friends' houses."
2,"Design is there, but not very practical","I bought one the Marine rack for myself and the white for my sister. We both had the same problem. Water pools in the bottom layer and molds. Yes, I empty out the water that accumulates throughout the day, but some water stays there. We both have ""retired"" this bottle rack to our cabinets.The design is beautiful and perfect for a modern kitchen. I now have The First Years drying rack and while it clashes with overall ""tone"" of the house, it is more practical. Luckily, I breastfeed so I do not have to use the rack too often except to dry the pump parts.I think this product fills a void in the market (come on designers... give us some non-baby looking modern products), however mold/mildew is not worth it to me."
4,sturdy bottle holder,it is very sturdy but the brush broke after only 3 weeks. i have searched the web and can't find anywhere to buy a replacement brush for this item so the whole thing doesn't look quite as good with a brush that doesn't match.
4,"NOT that great, and NOT for WIDE-NECK bottles! (2 stars!!)","NOT WORTH THE MONEY, AND I ONLY GIVE IT TWO STARS, BUT SINCE I EDITED MY REVIEW, IT WON'T LET ME CHANGE THE NUMBER OF STARS I GAVE IT (I first reviewed it when I was using smaller glass bottles with not as many parts). Yes, it's better for glass bottles than the collapsible ones, but it's NOT at all good for BORN FREE (or any other wide neck bottles) bottles because you can only fit them on every other upright (they're too wide to go right next to each other), and there's no room for all of the other venting pieces that come with Born Free bottles. The two bottom pieces are too small to hold much, and things fall off of them!"
4,Super,"You can't 'see' this product's actual size by just looking at a photo. It is quite large. It also doesn't hold the Playtex Drop-Ins bottles like I hoped it would.But this company is wonderful. The product is sturdy and the design is certainly a wonderful conversation piece. Honestly, if I wanted to just store bottles, I would have bought something else!"
4,baby bottle rack,"the bottle rack dryer is pretty much what I expected asthe way it had been described by the vendor ...it is a nice space saver on the counter top instead of thehuge flat one I had with all the spaces for the bottles ...the design is unique and quite attractive ... and the factthat the bottle brush stands upright in the middle is sucha fabulous idea ...I recommend it for any smaller kitchen ... it fits nicely intothe corner and is out of the way and not a detraction as thelarger, chunky ones are ... in fact it is possible that two couldbe used if needed for lots of bottles or if you have twins ...because it is such a clever design it could almost be a decoration !overall I am pleased that I purchased it..."
2,"Compact Design, So-So Quality","I like the compact, stylish design of this drying rack, but the brush handle broke off after only a month of usage. Granted, its a minor problem since brushes are cheap, but at the price I paid, I expected better quality. If I had to do over again, I would not buy this product again but would go for a cheaper rack instead and save my money to buy replacement brushes."
5,Form and function - pricey but awesome,"Ok, so it's a dish rack for baby stuff. At $25.99 on sale, that's probably a bit much for this non-essential to childrearing. But if you are a sucker for smart, beautiful design, I doubt you'll find better in the baby dish rack department. I didn't buy this myself (I couldn't justify spending the cash) but I did get it as a gift, and I am really happy with it. It makes me happy when I see it on the counter and it keeps the stuff I never seem to put away, neatly in one little red place. Skip Hop's stuff is pricey because you can tell they've paid people to design beautiful things... I'm okay with that, I just wish I could afford it all!"
3,Attractive but not as functional as I had hoped.,"I love Skip Hop products - we have several - and was excited to add this to our collection. However, it's not as functional as I'd hoped. We used a bottle that had a lot of parts to it and ended up only being able to fit three total bottles (with parts) on this drying rack. I love the color and the modern design, though, so if you don't use many bottles or bottles with a crazy amount of parts, this will be good for you."
2,Eye pleasing but...,"I bought this strictly for the look of it. I have the translucent one and it goes great on the kitchen counter. It is really nice that it neatly holds the brush too. The downside is that it really doesn't hold that much. The underneath piece just isn't super practical for holding things. I dislike the fact that it doesn't have a nipple brush either, which is completely necessary when hand washing bottles. We go through so many bottles on a daily basis that I've just started using the dishwasher. This would maybe hold half of the day's bottles for 1 child...especially if you are using Dr. Browns, which has a lot of pieces to it. It is pretty expensive too, compared to other racks. My advice: go to a consignment sale and buy one of the ugly, but functional ones for a buck."
2,Skip Hop Drying Rack- Clear,"I loved this drying rack at first, especially because it spins nicely and the brush is conveniently located in the middle, however, I have also had problems with mold/mildew in the middle where the water drains. I have taken it apart and cleaned it, and it is a pain to put back together. Plus the clear plastic shows water spots."
1,Avoid!,"Here is an example of the very worst type of ""Best of..."" collection discs: loaded up with tracks from the least popular of the albums from the period it covers and featuring only ""bleeding chunk"" extracts of the good material. If Amazon allowed discs to get no stars, this would qualify.(For a fuller review--and some tips on which TD discs to buy instead--see this disc's entry on the amazon.co.uk site.)"
3,Not the best compilation for the pink years.,"I'm a big fan of TD's early chapter but this ""best of"" album does'nt quite give a good overview of the ""pink years"". It seems short and feels more like an album of misc. tracks. Although I like the tracks from ""green desert"" they don't seem like they belong. The first CD of ""book of dreams"" which features remixed and shorter versions of pink year songs is actually a better listening experience because the tracks flow together really nicely.This album has some diversity to it but it does'nt feature ""wahn"" which is one of their most unique and powerful tracks from that era. I recommend getting ""book of dreams"" and ""Atem"" (1973) and you'll have most of the good tracks from the pink years."
1,A big disapointment,"Being a great fan of Jean Michel Jarre I've been very interested in Electronic music. A friend intoduced me to TD with the album Underwater Sunlight (which is amazing). I bought this album bearing in mind that the first albums by Jarre is among his best, but my god...this is not the case with TD! This is by far the worst cd I've ever heard. I love catchy themes and soundscapes, but this cd has neither. It's a series of weird sounds and effects. To be honest I'm surprised how anyone can enjoy this album, but then again...every man - different taste, and I respect that."
3,Misleading,"The size for this product was listed as just '8' so I thought I was buying a regular width size 8 shoe. Unfortunately it was a narrow width, so I can't wear them for running. Its slightly my fault as I should have known better than to think that there were still regular size 8's out there to buy. Why does NB have to discontinue good shoes? As a runner who has a hard time finding shoes that fit's them well, it really sucks."
4,Good guide for marriage communication skills,"We studied this book in a newlywed small group with our church. Some of the scenarios are kinda cheesy, but overall this book had some really good guides for communication and conflict resolution that I think we'll take with us throughout our marriage. Worth reading."
5,A Worthy Read,"This is a wonderful guide for married couples, or those who plan to be married. Even if you are not currently having any marital problems, this book will help enhance your marriage relationship. And even if only one person of the couple reads it, it will still be beneficial. I highly recommend this book."
5,MUST READ FOR YOUNG MARRIED COUPLE,"The book discusses the heart of conflict and compromise in a relationship. It also teaches you how to resolve conflict. As the book stated, all couples encounter conflict, finances, sex, the children, work schedules, etc., but good relationships resolve conflicts,while bad relationships allow conflict to eat away at the happiness in the relationship. GREAT BOOK!!"
1,PURA BASURA,"El segundo album de Raul es aun peor que su debut ""Sueño Su Boca"" que ya practicamente tocaba el suelo con la calidad nefasta de sus ""canciones"" y la baja calidad de la produccion.Pero esto ya es el limite...15 canciones mal interpretadas y de indole aburridisimo, y una produccion que solo podria haber sido hecho en España.Para olvidar."
1,yuck,"i hate this doll. it looks really ugly and has very bad clothes. i agree, those trend girls will be better to play with than this!!anybody know were to find the diva stars robots! i have 2 but i lost the laptop top and her cell also her dress so if you know please tell."
1,i hate this toy,i love the diva starz robots because you can talk to them and play with them but not this one. it only has a feww things to say and there mostly about boys and shopping. you cant do anything with it. i hate it times 10. and yes im helping you! NOT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!! bye
1,Down the toilet!,I only have a few words to say. THIS TOY WAS SO BORING I HAD MORE FUN STARING AT A WALL! The End.
1,EWWWWW! Gross!,THESE DOLLS ARE SOOOOOOOO DISGUSTING! They look like alians from another planet. I mean look at them! Who would want to play with something with huge eyes that makes them look so hidius? I know I don't! I would rather play with trollz and teen trends for the rest of my life!
2,VERY CREEPY,These dolls are SO FREAKY!They have huge eyes!They only think about shopping and boys!Don't buy these scary toys!!
3,informative but cynical,"This is a pretty thorough and informative look at the sexual habits of America from the 70's to the present. Most of the reading is interesting and fun, and the photographs of old magazine ads are great. After a while, however, the author's cynical, condescending tone started to grate on me. For instance, regarding hot tubs: 'soon California was deafened by the sounds of old growth redwoods falling to keep up with the demand. And of course, hot tub owners soon realized you had to occasionally clean out the filters, whch would become clogged with pubic hair and other human mange'. A little of this goes a long way, but it seems like Boulware ends every example in the book with a similar disclaimer. I found it read best in small doses."
1,Long Run review,"This movie was a general letdown.. I have seen better movies like Chariots of Fire and Prefontaine, so I went in to this movie knowing it might be poor, but the acting was mundane even for those diminished standards.....not recommended"
3,ok but not great,it was different but not one of my favorites. It was expecting more like chariots of fire but was not too inspired by it.
4,"Me Jane, You Tarzan","Why do guys read romance novels? Well, this didn't look like a romance novel and I was about 50 pages in when I figured it out.So what to do? I know what's going to happen, so how will theauthor get there?Set mostly in Seattle (placing jazz at a Queen Anne Hill bistro that's never heard of jazz) the novel has the usual amount of deceit, et cetera, and the men all wear hats that are either very, very white or very, very black.But the major shortcoming of this book is that the central character, Jane, sounds much more interesting than the author lets her become. Putting all the good lines into the mouth of her anima ""Kate"", the author makes the Jane character the colorless victim of events around her.It's an acceptable first novel, but I hope to hear more from Jane next time out."
3,"Great concept, but...","This is a great concept and something that has worked for many years in the Montessori classroom. However, I would point out that the print quality isn't really the best compared to more modern examples, and as another reviewer pointed out, sometimes the lines don't really line up. You need to be very careful not to cut into the artwork!I wound up using this in the course of our homeschooling curriculum, but I also came across some awesome little art cards here on Amazon for super cheap. If you search for ""Small-Format Card Books"" you'll find several sets of small art postcards featuring a variety of important artists. They are mostly included in the Prime shipping program and are currently part of the 4-for-3 deal, to boot. At (way) less than 2 dollars for a pack of 6 cards, it's a steal and a great way to expand the idea presented in this series."
5,"Great quality, for easy introduction to art.","Love this series! I have young kids and teach in a rurual area. Not a lot of museums to go to around here. These cards are a perfect way to introduce art to young ones. They are hands on and great quality. This book is only the postcards not the ""how to"" book. After cutting apart the postcards you do not have a book left at all. So if you want the instructions for using them you need the ""How to use Child Size Masterpieces"". However I do know some moms that use with out that book. They create their own games and drills to help the kids learn."
5,Hornblower's Capt Pellew Sings and Dances!,"For those of us who missed Robert Lindsay in ""Me and My Girl"", this delightful film allows us to see him dance and sing a la Astaire and Kelly. And, yes, Hornblower fans, Lindsay is our very own Captain Sir Edward Pellew"
3,"One quite nice, one only mediocre","The first story, The Vampire Viscount, is very well done with a few minor, but nice twists on vamps. Harbaugh creates good characters in Nicholas and Leonore and a very good romance. It's not perfect but it's something different, has some excellent moments, and is a nice read. Three stars.The Devil's Bargain is not as good -- its devil and angel ""bargain"" is trite and takes away from the storyline. Although Eveline's great, you sometimes don't know whether or not to like Richard. One and 1/2 to two stars."
2,Not very useful for an owner builder,"I bought this book and ""The Owner Builder Book"" before I started building my own house. ""The Owner Builder Book"" was a very useful tool while this book mainly served to warn me about building techniques used by some contractors to save money, barely meeting minimum building codes. I'd recommend looking at this book in a library before buying to see some of the house pictures. If they look like things you'd be happy with (uncased doors and windows, carpeted stairs, closets without doors, wire closet shelves, stairs with knee walls instead of balustrade, laminate counters and fewer doors and windows to save money), then buy it. It could save you some money."
2,Disappointing.,As gregorian Chants go this was disappointing. Don't like the modern stuff. Alwaysfound Gregorian chants inspiring and more religious. Would not recommend this .
3,Shattering,"One of the several works of Elizabeth Hand's that I picked up after being inspired by ""Waking the Moon,"" this novel left me with a sense of chilled desolation. The characters touched a nerve that I don't want to feel again. Although I probably could not read ""Winterlong"" again, I am glad for the experience, and still give it high marks for its creative integrity and Ms. Hand's remarkable style."
2,A stylish sci-fi story that collapses upon itself,"This novel showed great promise for the first half of the story, but then gets bogged down in some nonsensical motivations of some of the characters. I lost interest in the main character during the second half and maybe I missed the point of the novel. I just don't feel like re-reading it to get it. I loved the mood and style of the novel though, but that's just not enough to carry the story."
2,"well, I really liked the first half","For the first half of this book, I might have given this book four or five stars. I swear though, it is almost like another writer picked up the proverbial quill for the second half of the book. The writing in the second half felt long and drawn out and just didn't go where I thought it might based on the first half. I liked the characters well enough and the author can spin and excellent and compelling tale, but what happened to the last half of this book? It showed so much promise but it just fell flat half way through."
5,best book can ever be written by an earthling!,"I borrowed Paul's Idiot Letters from my English teacher and it has been the coolest 'assignment' ever. But the best part is when I wrote to Paul myself and he's proven himself to be the real thing!!! He's the best, and even better.."
5,The funniest book I have ever read in My 22 years.,"I am a business major at Sam Houston State University. After taking a business writing class, a friend introduced me to this book. I have never laughed at any book in my life, until I ran across the first Idiot Letters, by Paul Rosa. My favorite is the one about the eagle in a gas station advertisement. You will cry laughing! Lonnie Lee Best"
4,Complete Idiot Letters as reviewed by complete idiot,"Even funnier than the original Idiot Letters; Mr. Rosa strikes fear into the hearts of Corporate America, and giggles in their mail rooms."
5,Another great one!,"I feel almost compelled to write a review of this book. Why? Because I'm partly responsible for its publication! I reviewed Paul's first book here at Amazon.com, and he thanked me for writing the review. I emailed him back asking when another one of these books was coming out. He didn't have a publisher. Well, my dad's in the business, and my dad liked the first one, and it turns out he thought the second one was funny enough to publish. It is a great book, too: again, Paul is the master idiot letter writer! The letter to Ford Trucks and Toshiba Televisions are the best (including the letters in the first book!). Paul's request to be one of the Fruit of the Loom guys was also quite funny. And to all you other would-be authors out there: I'm not a referral service, this is the only book I've ever referred, and so please don't flood my email box!"
2,Morris runs out of gas third time around.,"Bob Morris falls a bit flat in this third of the Zack Chasteen series. Missing are the bits of local history and culture that give a tropic mystery its flavor, and in its place is a frenetic pacing (there must have been a dozen chapters of two pages or less) along a workmanlike plot (the villain is obvious halfway through the book) that still leaves some final questions unanswered. Morris seems to have run out of ways to develop Zack and Boggy as characters, substituting Zack's cynical put downs of Boggy's mysticism for any real development of their relationship. In summary, a decent read on the beach or in the airport, but a weaker cousin of the first two books, which had the energy and novelty of a really promising new franchise. Hopefully No. 4 in the series will recapture the magic of No. 1."
5,Duffy,Never read a dull Zack Chasteen adventure. Easy to lose yourself in this stuff for an evening. Kind of a copy cat author along the lines of Randy Wayne White and Carl Haasen. Characters not as well rounded and not of the same writing quality and Chasteen is rather more dense than Doc Ford but addictive nevertheless.
3,"looks ok, but very cheap material","Looks good from far, and might look good on pictures but it's very cheap material. The material is very thin. The buttons are made of plastic and very fragile. I only tried it on and almost broke one of the buttons.You get what you pay for!!!!"
1,Cheap and flimsy,"The vests ran smaller than advertised, the material was incredibly thin, and the buttons popped off with absurd ease. The back of the buttons were plastic instead of metal and broke easily. Every button on my vest popped off due mainly to getting snagged on other items of clothing. I won't be buying this brand again."
3,average quality at a good price,All the metal bandsaw blades are high speed steel blade material that is made into a band and spot welded and the quality is going to be the same. No reason to pay more for one brand or to buy from one company over another. Dimensions are the same for most band saws so seldom a need to buy a replacement from the manufacturer or one of their dealers.The band saw blades I use tend to break from fatigue before they wear out and I have seen no difference in this regard or overall performance between the different ones I have purchased over the years.
3,Sounds A Bit The Same,"The sound is very good. This is in my opinion, Last Day of April's best cd. But the songs begin to sound the same and repetitive. That's the only real complaint, but it becomes a big one. Glowing Me, Choking You is the best, in my humble opinion."
4,foozpat!,"amazing, a more experimental release from this excellent band, but it doesn't fail to meet the big expectations carried from the beautiful ""rainmaker"". stunning guitar work and an excellent string section more than complements the powerful yet comforting vocals, which is enough to like this band alone. notice the incredible production, digital sampling and an interesting instrumental. stunning to the new fans, and pleasing to the old. polished and romantic."
2,not pleased,"I purchased this item to try and restore the grout on my floor. It was recommended by my granite installer. It really didn't work and where it did try and work it left it spotty. And by all means don't let it even touch any stainless steel. It leaves spots that do not come off even if you remove it immediatly. Very upsetting, especially when you just remodeled a kitchen and have a new sink and range that are stainless and are now stained from this product. They do warn you about this problem and tell you to wipe it off immediatly, just don't let it touch any stainless."
5,Stone Tech RS4-G Restore Ceramic Tile and Grout Cleaner,Excellent getting the grout and tiles cleaned. did it by hand and it is GREAT!!!!!! I recommend it to everyone. A little hard workmade it like new....
1,Misquote,"The editorial review for this book misquotes the Declaration of Independence. The review states this: ""We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.""In reality, the Declaration says this: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."""
1,Overrated,"I agree with the reader from Washington, DC. The book is overrated and not much more than the actual documents. Very disappointed!"
4,The Least We Can Do is Be Informed,"Our Country is the greatest nation the world has ever seen. The tenets of this representative republic are beautifully and most eloquently presented for us, the people--individual and collective. Despite the venomous attacks on Congress and the philandering of the President, our Nation is founded in these principles which are a sacred trust to us and our children. To ensure the growth and prosperity of our Nation, the least we can do is be informed. The truths of these documents cannot be overlooked, by pollution of invented reality editorials, polls, and those who remain ignorant. Read the documents--as they were written, and sparingly heed the commentary. The only thing preventing a 5 star review is the excessive introduction and commentary. God Bless America!"
4,Nice System - Easy Installation.,"Quick/easy installation in just over an hour! I really wanted keyless entry on my 1994 Mercedes E320 - this unit can be easily modified for the vacuum locks using the supplied instructions. They also offer phone support (did not use) when installing. If you have ever installed a car stereo, you can install this kit. I liked the small, OEM looking remote (not MB OEM, but a nice feel). The programming button is a little large, but you get used to it. Only downside is the package only has a single remote. Additional remotes can be found on Amazon or eBay. Additional relays are needed if you want to flash the lights or honk the horn (future projects)."
2,even with battery backup it looses it's programming every time main power is lost,"I got this as a timer for my block heater, I mounted it in my truck, but it is not keeping the program, it does keep time, but does not remember to run the program after the power is lost, so for me it is an expensive switch. I know I'm not using it the way it is designed, but, buyers should be aware that it will either be on forever, or off forever after a power failure, depending on whether it was off, or on when the power went out."
4,Vivien: The Life of Vivien Leigh,Great book! Lots of info I didn't know about her. Some of it was a bit too detailed for me. Such a sad story of her life.
3,a tad disappointing,"As a fan of Vivien Leigh, I was hoping for a biography that would delve more into her personal life. Instead, it dragged with pages and pages dedicated to mostly her career. However, if you can breeze through the boring parts, the rest is worth it."
2,BORING BOOK GOOD CONDITION,THIS BOOK WAS NOT GOOD. THE CONDITION AND THE SPEED IN WHICH I RECIEVED IT WAS GREAT.
5,Amazing Biographer,"I love this book! I think a lot of biographies are boring, without a lot of real insight into the person's character. This one was fun and entertaining all the way through, and didn't go on too much with details we don't care about. Great look into a fascinating lady."
2,disappointing,"Maybe its just the style if writing, because I know this woman had a fascinating life, but I have only gotten half way through this book because its god awful boring. The writer seems to be more interested in her early career and the details of her contracts and her stage work than the personal and human parts of her early life. Or maybe he just couldn't find out any of that? Either way, maybe someday, I will finish it, but too many other good books to read at the moment! Half way through, its a yawn!"
4,Original classic,"Original classic movie. Quality could have been better, but then it wouldn't have had the same effect of watching the original wolfman."
5,Acapella Heaven,Go Fish sings in harmony that will make you want to own all of their CD's. This collection of songs includes customized harmonious versions of old classics like Go Tell It On The Mountain. If harmony is your style - and even it if isn't - you will LOVE this CD!
4,Very groovy CD,My favorite track on this CD is 'Silent Night'. It is the only version that I LOVE. The rest of the CD is cool too. It's nice to pop this in the player at Christmas time and sing along. Have fun!
5,First of the line ... well worn!,"This game was in my Gameboy, Advance, and DS for years. After settling into bed, I would play this for about 15 minutes to relax me into a good sleep. Replaced it with Picross DS a few years ago (which I've just about finished with, going through the whole game twice PLUS the downloadables).Am excited about buying the third one (Picross3D) tomorrow!"
5,Great puzzler game for the Game Boy,"I bought the Japanese version of this game. I first learned Picross using a pencil. This version is more fun and less messy! The implementation is excellent -- the controls are easy to use and game play is intuitive. After I finished all the puzzles, I longed for more. All in all, a puzzler well worth having."
2,Not great,"This book really isn't that great. It came highly recommended, so I was disappointed when I got it. It pretty much just says exactly what ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" says...word for word sometimes! The books I really use are What to Expect When You're Expecting, The Pregnancy Bible, The Mother of All Pregnancy Organizers, The Everything Twins...Book, and The Pregnancy Countdown. You really don't need to buy the ""Dr. Spock"" book."
2,More of the Bizarre than the Usable,"The women who speak candidly are mostly far from the mainstream. There's nothing wrong with that, but the title is misleading. I expected information that would apply to most women, not primarily those on the fringe. - - The only valuable point made is that some women enjoy and desire sex for purely physical reasons. This book did not meet my expectations. The best part of it is the photo on the cover. - -"
1,"Offensive, Crude, and very Obnoxious","As a staunch feminist, I find this type of trash repulsive. It is as bad, if not worse, than Penthouse letters or any other porn magazine. The author asks sexually oriented questions of these pathetically open women. Where did he find them? I think any time men manipulative women for their sexuality it is just wrong. And this new strain of S/M glofication, sadism and masochism, and sexual experimentation is just a throw back to ancient patriarchial views. Sexpectations, through interviews, gives graphic sexual details about women's desires. I think this type of smut should be thrown in the trash. Most women I know are not into this type of deviance. It is men, afterall, who have been the promoters of porn, sexism in advertising, and displays of women in the media."
1,"Only 2 pages (#100,101) were worth reading, & they were good","Interviews of abnormal women the author presents as normal. Per this book almost every woman is heavily into BDSM (bondage, dominance, sado mashochism). It's nonesense! Pages 100 & 101 have some good practical advice, but that's it."
1,Dead as a doornail,"This battery worked fine when I first got it. Now, after nine months of VERY light use in my Pentax camera (like, I may have shot a couple dozen photos with it) it's completely, utterly dead. Won't even charge.Meanwhile, the original Pentax battery that came with the camera five years ago is still working great.I just wanted a second battery so I could always have a charged one on hand. Apparently there's a reason why SterlingTek's battery is so much cheaper than the Pentax one."
5,Awesome,This is an exceptionally detailed and well written accounting of the III Germanisches SS Panzer Korps... dryly entertaining but very educational and satisfying. If you're researching the fate of a battalion or company this is the place to find your information.
3,Monotonous and Odd,"I grabbed this book a year ago expecting the best, however i was in for a rude awakening. The book is monotonous and its structure is terrible, it fails to appeal to the reader or communicate to the reader in anyway and besides that it gives a stereotypical description of the Red Army as a faceless horde.It also tends to endorse the SS and its actions calling it Europes first Army of defense against the Reds before NATO, another inadequate book on the East. True the book can be descriptive and informative but its largely biased and unnapealling. Awaste of time and Money!"
4,World War II for Kids: A History with 21 Activities,This book even has a Foreword from Senator John McCain. I do believe that children of all ages and adults can enjoy reading this book.
4,used for report,My high school son needed 4 childrens books which included information about Winston Churchill for a school project. This book was informative and fit the bill.You will see this exact same review on the other books we had to purchase for this project. They were all very similar and used in the same manner.
2,Not a kids book really,"As a book on the War I might would give it more stars, but if you want to label it is a book for kids it stinks.They basically took a World War 2 book and threw in 21 pointless activities, such as1)collect all the scrap metal around your house for a week. Now imagine how much more you'd have to have to make a plane!2)Make a care package for a soldier3)Design your own recruiting poster4)Sew a yellow felt star on your t-shirtThere are better books for kids on this topic."
3,History for kids,Teachers need books for elementary books. There are many different books out there to help teach our future kids of America.
2,Kundon't,"Slow first half kills modestly interesting second half of this epic bio of the Dalai Lama. The film makers feel everyone knows the inner workings of Tibetan culture, leading to constant frustration about the goings-on."
2,meh,"didnt really like the movie, I bought it on here cause I broke my friends disc and felt bad so I replaced it."
1,"Perhaps I expected too much, but....","I didn't find this very informative or compelling. The film never really explains the nature of Tibetian government, the rule of the Dalai Lama, what made it unique, etc. It's take on Buddhism is simplistic. At one point His Holiness is asked to recite the Four Noble Truths. Geez, I would've thought they would get past that after a week or so (and he makes the common Western error of translating the first noble truth as ""suffering"" instead of ""sorrowful impermanence"" or a like phrase). In a ""dramatic"" moment, he is asked who he is on crossing the Indian border, and he says: ""the moon on the water."" It comes off as a Buddhist cliche.If you aren't familiar with the story of Tibet, its history, and the actions of the Chinese already, this won't inform you. The film is stunning visually, but I am somewhat tired of the MTV approach to filmmaking: if it's a good image, use it, regardless of whether it fits in the story or informs the viewer of needed information."
2,"Too long, too boring","I think this movie was too long, too boring and too odl day fashioned for me to understand it comepletely but I think the acting was excellent. How would they remember all those boring words and sentences? I was really disappointed when I went to see it but I think we should give the actors some credit for they put their best work into this movie. I would only recommened this movie to people at least 50 - 100 years old, it is pretty ancient. Kundun is boring, long and true but it is still a movie and we kidn of have to be grateful."
5,Awesome,"A very moving tale of the fourteenth Dalai-Lama, from birth to his forced exile from Chinese occupied Tibet."
4,This film gives viewers much information that they should know,"This is a very informative film directed by Martin Scorsese in which he portrays the life of the fourteenth, the present, Dalai Lama, from childhood through the Chinese occupation of Tibet and his exile into India. The Buddhists believe that the soul of the first Dalai Lama is reincarnated into another person after he dies and that this person has some recollections of his former existence. Thus it is interesting to see how the monks discover that this child is the reincarnated Dalai Lama. It is also fascinating to watch how he is treated, how he matures, the plight of Tibet, the behavior of the Chinese, and the life and suffering of the Tibetan people."
4,Very good,"If you are one who enjoys learning about different spiritual ideas or if this faith is your personal path, you will likely enjoy this movie.This is a good and interesting movie and made me really think. I am one who likes to learn about many spiritual paths and I really enjoyed this movie. In fact, I just rented it from my library and just purchased it to add to my spiritual movie collection."
5,Great Film and Great Score.,"This so far is the only Blu-ray release of this film all the way from Singapore. It states that it is Region A however it worked fine on my standard UK BD player. The film is a beautiful work of art on Scorsese part and the Oscar worthy score by Philip Glass further adds to the captivating nature of the film. It charts the Tibetan life of the 14th Dalai Lama, from his discovery as a boy to his teenage escape to India caused by the invasion of the Chinese. I found this film very eye opening to the situation in Tibet and Buddhism itself. The only downer is it does not have any true extras for that I recommend the stand alone DVD ""In Search of Kundun with Martin Scorsese"". Enjoy."
4,Rent don't buy - Can't justify the DVD purchase,"If you just like collecting DVDs, then ignore my advise. I buy DVDs to learn more about the movie as well as have an excellent copy. This is a must see movie! I highly recommend it to any Martin Scorsese and, of course, Dali Lama fan. A very moving picture where the story is basically a piece of history. Unfortunately, there is nothing added to the DVD version other than a trailer. I was hoping for a director's commentary (I like to hear Mr. Scorsese talk about his pictures) or a behind the scenes piece to make the purchase of the DVD more justifiable. The quality of the transfer is excellent. I recommend renting the DVD/VHS and hope that a Special Edition of this movie with more additions comes out in the future. I'll watch my copy and probably buy the new release..."
4,Kundun Kudos,"After making Casino-one of the most disappointing flicks of his stellar career-wasn't it about time Scorcese turned his sights back to more serious, weighty matters.Kundun's plot is unconventional by Hollywood standards and might be just plain boring to those expecting a gory Asian massacre. But like Scorcese's shamefully unseen The Last Temptation of Christ, Kundun brings a human touch to a worshipped man-our sympathies extend beyond mere reverence. While it fails to completely unravel the core character of the Dalai Lama, it brings awareness to the beauty and the suffering of one of the most tragic and tranquil lives of this century."
5,Ranks with Mr. Scorsese's Best,"""Kundun"" is a near-perfect marriage of sound and vision, thanks to Philip Glass' mesmerizing score (get the CD) and Roger Deakins' mindblowing cinematography. It deserves a place alongside ""Mean Streets"", ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas"" as one of Martin Scorsese's greatest movies."
2,Well Done,This film gives a good overview of what life is and was like in Tibet before and after China took over Tibet. It gives a good view of what the Dali Lhama is all about and of Tibetan spiritual life in general. The cinematography is beautiful. Anyone even remotely interested in what Tibet and what the Dali Lhama are about would enjoy this film.
2,"The Zen of ""Unhelpful"" Reviews","Martin Scorcese goes Bertolucci with this painterly portrait of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan culture, but ""The Last Emperor"" this ain't. No, I didn't go in expecting ""Raging Zen"" or ""Goodmonks"". And yes, the frame is filled with visual splendor and Scorcese's mastery of cinematic composition and color is on full display, but somewhere along the way he forgot something called ""an interesting narrative"". The actual story of the Dalai Lama's struggle and exile IS in fact a fascinating tale, so this should have been a no-brainer. Using ""non-actors"" is always a gamble, and in this case an unfortunate decision. I think Scorcese got too hung up on his obvious reverence toward the subject, to the point of stifling his own creative license. What you end up with is a glorified TV documentary--pretty to look at, but ultimately a curiously detached exercise in tedium."
3,Good but ...,"I could have given it a higher rating if the film has more emotional impact and the main characters speak their natural languages. Every time someone opens their mouth, I was constantly and immediately reminded that it is a (made in Hollywood) movie after all."
4,Kundun,"This movie was astonishingly good. I'd seen the movie box constantly when visiting the video store and thought it looked like a boring biographical film. I was wrong. The moviewas not what I thought it would be. It represented theDalai Lama's life from when he was born to when he moved toIndia. I felt there could have been more in the movie. Moreaccounts of his life, the transitions between each age weretoo quick and I feel there should've been more. As far asbiographical movies go, I feel this is one of the best I'veseen, and from other research I found that it is very historically accurate (aside from missing certain events)."
5,The best movie I've seen involving the Dalai Lama!!,This movie was Awsome! If you know anything about the Dalai Lama or just want to find out more about him this is the movie to see!! The movie had aspects of the the Dalai Lama's life that you wouldn't see or hear about unless you read about him. If you have any taste in movies whatsoever you'll like this film!
3,The life of HH Dalai Lama,"If you are looking for movie about the discovery and life of the Dalai Lama, then this is good. With that said, Scorsese missed the opportunity to show the world what really happened to the Tibetan people!!!!If you are looking for a good documentary on Tibet, I recommend TIBET CRY OF THE SNOW LION"
5,Visual music,"Stunningly gorgeous. More than a movie, this is art that can be viewed repeatedly, like great music can be enjoyed again and again. The culture is fascinating, and the story intensely moving."
5,Kundun,"This is a beautiful film, in both style and subject matter. The scenes and cinematography are outstanding and the story of the Dalai Lama's early life and exile are fascinating to watch. This is a great place to go if you wish to learn about this turbulent time in Tibet and isn't too biased or 'Hollywood' either. Great!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,All Dressed Up But Nowhere to Go,"This is a gorgeous, reverential account of the Dalai Lama's life that airbrushes out any real dramatic conflict for the sake of the pretty colors. In the early scenes this underscores Kundun's remoteness from the secular world, but as the movie rolls on, Scorsese's eye for Eastern splendor overtakes the story of Tibet's struggle and the 18-year-old Kundun's growing response to it. I share Scorsese's respect for the Dalai Lama, but I think there's a crippling Orientalist romance at work in this movie. Would he treat a Western leader so uncritically? A lot of love and passion clearly went into this production; I wish it had dropped the dreamy filters and done justice to a very human tragedy."
1,Unhappy Experience with Amazon's handling.,"Amazon Purchase: We thought we ordered this The Pink Panther Movie Collection on dvd..however when we received it, it was vhs, which we can't use.I corresponded with your staff back and forth several times with no satisfaction. Her answer was that, ""we do not sell vhs tapes. I then quoted her the order number, date and other information.Her reply was that she was sorry but you do not sell anything on vhs.I finally gave up after several unsatisfactory responsesand erased the e-mails.We have the vhs set...we re-ordered the dvd from you and received it in very good condition.That's my experience with ordering that item from Amazon. We are very pleased with our other purchases."
5,Bluetooth harnes for Jeep,"This harness saved me alot of money. Without it, I would have to pay another 100 dollars from the dealer. Not to mention, it works perfectly! Highly recommended."
4,"Good book, with some minor problems","Overall this is a really great book with lots of examples and good problems, however my complaint is that some of the problems haven't been covered in the examples and so they are too difficult to solve. For instance, in the chapter on node voltages, none of the examples covers floating voltage sources that have other components like resistors in series with them, yet a number of the problems involve such floating voltage sources. I had to refer to the Schaum's Outline of Basic Circuit Analysis (another very good book, btw) to find an example problem for that.If you're looking for books on electric circuits, however, I would definitely recommend this one along with the Schaum's Outline book I mentioned above."
5,very useful,"This is probably the most useful engineering textbook I have on my shelf. Not only is it very easy to understand, but as a reference, I like it even better! The math is lucid, yet never overwhelming, and in addition, the problems are quite interesting. I highly recommend this book, rather than Nilsson's. (I think one of the Authors of this book has written/edited an EE handbook as well, which I am less familiar with. Maybe I'd check that one out too)"
5,Beginning electrical engineering,"It's a good read so far. Understandable with tons of examples and practice problems. It is for the first circuit analysis course. It is not for beginning digital. If you work the problems you will learn the basics towards being a EE or good tech. It is calculus based, but the math is held down to a tolerable level."
5,Great,"This is a decent start for novice engineers. Unlike other texts on the same subject it has very effective methodology of teaching the very basic concepts of electric circuits. A bulk of solved examples is there to help you understand techniques of circuit analysis. It really soothed me when I was suffering from ""circuit phobia"". This text is highly recommended by me for beginners."
2,Terrible book. Too many equations and not enough explanation.,"This book is the book we use in our basic circuits class. This book is quite poor. There is way too much focus on derivations and not enough on simple text explanations. Most of the examples are too easy compared to homework problems. Comparing it to some older textbooks such as ""Mathematics for Electronics"" By Forrest Barker 1st edition, it seems like these newer textbooks just list equation after equation at you without explanation. I don't have too much experience with similar textbooks, but I have a copy of Nilsson-Riedel's Electric Circuits and it seems much better."
1,A less-than-brilliant 'best of' release,"This is a reasonable survey of Tangerine Dream's albums ""Le Parc"" and ""Underwater Sunlight"", with some chunks of ""Poland"", ""Tyger"" and ""Livemiles"" thrown in. It doesn't contain enough of any of these albums to be worth having, though, nor is it sufficiently representative (especially of ""Poland"" or ""Tyger"") to be a useful way of finding out whether or not the full albums are worth having! Personally, I'd recommend putting the money towards copies of ""Livemiles"" and ""Poland"", if you don't have those. Or, if you're interested in the ""Tyger"", ""Le Parc"" and ""Underwater Sunlight"" tracks, go for the 5-CD ""Dream Roots Collection"" instead. It is more expensive, obviously, but it has a better mix of tracks than here, (from the same albums) and has some otherwise unavailable tracks on it too."
5,A Music Therapist's Best Friend,"For anyone who works with people, whether they are a music therapist an elementary music teacher, or an activity director at an assisted living home, this book will become your best friend. It covers so many great songs that can be used for anyone, from children to geriatrics. I have fallen in love with it."
2,Great Content - Horrible Spellings,"I think this book is extremely interesting, but for the following reasons I had to give it two stars. The fact that I paid for this for the Kindle led me to expect a good translation from real book to e-book. My Kindle version has way too many spelling errors to be acceptable. If the book were free, I would not have minded, but since I did pay for it I expected better quality control. If I had to estimate, I'd say there are errors every ten pages or so."
1,Too much like a text book.,Not what I expected. Sorry I ordered it . Not a fiction book which I thought it was. Crappy book.
4,Fascinating History,"I don't read a lot of non fiction and am pretty selective when I do. I took a chance on this book because I've been to the Museum of Natural History as a very small child and the images there still stick with me more than 60 years later. This book brings back many memories as well as the back stories of many of the displays I still remember. A very good read, well written and informative. I'd recommend this to anyone. An entertaining gem."
4,A surprise.,"I have had this book on my ""next to read"" list for quite a while now. So, after having read many of this authors other offerings, I purchased this one on my Kindle and jumped in expecting a good mystery. Well, I got what I asked for but not what I expected. It is a mystery to me that a book this detailed and scientific could also be a really good read.I have visited the Museum of Natural History in New York City several times before but after reading this book I plan to go again with a much different prospective. This time I will view the exhibits with the knowledge that everything there took more time, more money and much more foresight than I would have believed."
4,Informative and enjoyable read,The book lays out many key features of the museum and how the artifacts were acquired. It has some black & white photos showing key facets of the museum's history as described in the book. The narrative is written in a novel-like way adding to the reading enjoyment.
4,Adventure In The Everglades,"If you like adventure, I would highly recommend this book because it has a lot of adventure in it. It taught me that even if you are in a bad situation, if you use your head, you can find a way to get out of it. Also, you always need to trust in God, because that is what Tyler did when he was in need of help from God.This story is about a boy named Tyler whose father woke up next to a dead man. Afraid of being accused of murdering him, he fled with his wife and Tyler to a place called Lostmans River. There, they changed their last name and, a few years later, another baby was born. When Tyler is in his early teens, a stranger called Mr. Strawbridge comes and wants to know if Tyler wants to work for him...To find out the rest, read the book!"
1,Broke on first use,"Very first time I used it, I was pushing off the dock and the plastic head snapped off.Not repairable.I have to purchase another, and it won't be this brand!"
1,UST tires are problematic...,"Although it is a common practice to use sealant in tubeless setups, Kenda says the warranty is void if you do (this is written on the tag that comes attached to the tire). Other than that, they look like great tires. Hopefully Kenda will fix this problem in futures products."
2,"Good on pavement, but they are supposed to be good off-road","Ive done hundreds of rides with these tires and have not been happy riding in Virginia with them. They are not good on the conditions: loose, compact, wet, clay, roots... Anything else? I'm not happy with them."
5,nice,I have a setnof these and use them 50/50 road and dirt. they are fantastic in hardpack and semi loose stuff such as gravel. the only thing i can complain about is the loud hum they produce on the road but that isnt fair since they were not designed for that. great tire with a tall aggresive tread. will buy again.
1,Tang Soo Do Korean Empty Hand Self-Defense Book of Hyungs,"Pictures were hand drawn and very poor quality, and entire section of the book was upside down. For the price I expected a better quality book."
1,Get some matches,"You would be better off using this book as kindling than as a source. If you depend on this author, his information, his books as a source to educate or validate your own information....then you will soon be known as a bafoon! There are so many errors in not only historical information but in basic translations it isn't funny. The cover itself should be a clue to you. That isn't even Hangul on the cover. No one really knows what it is supposed to be, but according to the author, it is supposed to say Tang Soo Do in Korean. It doesn't! But that should prove to you this author will attempt to pass off onto you what he himself has no knowledge about."
3,"pay double for the ""Grizzly name","I have a Jet brand bandsaw and had a hard time finding a replacement blade until I located this one from Grizzly. I did not realize that 64-1/2"" x 1/2"" is an industry standard and that anyone's bandsaw blade would work.I paid double the normal price for a standard bandsaw blade to get this Grizzly branded one which is no better, just twice as expensive. Next time I will know better."
1,not fuel proof,"This item is not fuel proof. I contacted Pacer Technology, the vendor on this subject. They stated this is a false staement by the seller. The item will not hold up in fuel."
1,Absolute Garbage,"This kit comes wrapped up nicely and looks good. Looks like it's worth $25. The wires are so F-ing cheap that crimping a connector onto them causes them to break. The RCA's are crap and made a nice static sound, and the power cord was coming apart at the amp one strand at a time. I have installed many amps and car stereos, and this kit is completely useless. I yanked out everything I got here and replaced it. This product is so terrible it makes me angry, and if you buy it you deserve the misery."
1,Outrageous,Amazon's price on this is crazy. 12 bottles of 500 for over 40 dollars. I can get 6 bottles of 1000 the exact same thing for about 10 dollars cheaper just without using amazon. MAKE SURE AND DO A SEARCH AND PRICE COMPARE RATHER THAN PAYING AMAZONS RIP OFF PRICE.
3,"Too much jazz, not enough substance.","Yikes! What happened to the Mythos I heard on the self-titled album and ""Reality of a Dreamer""? Now it seems that Bob D'Eith (piano) and Paul Schmidt (guitar) have shifted in a smooth jazz direction, much to my annoyance. The only track on ""Eternity"" I liked was ""Unity"", the rest I quickly dismissed after a few minutes into the abyss of forgetfulness. Let's hope that Mythos goes back to the dark vibes of their earlier works, and not try to sound like 3rd Force again."
3,Mythos: Continuation of inconsistancy,"As a long time fan of Era, Delerium, Enya, Lesiem and Magna Canta, I saw Mythos as my next step in the new age genre. As I have reviewed other Mythos' albums here on Amazon.com I am again struck with the feeling that the duo artists behind Mythos the entity have again augmented inconsistancy. This album release has some of the older songs from previously released albums mixed with new song samples. In this album, Bob D'Eith and Paul Schmidt include ethnic instruments and sounds into the songs, trying to coalesce a sleeping giant awake. Personally this album is another disappointment with every song being inconsistant. It seemed to me that they were searching for a sound that could make Mythos distinctive and unique.Just like their counterparts Lesiem and Enya who have found their niche in the new age music scene, Mythos is a wandering giant still looking for a home in the land of new age music."
4,"Good, but not quite up there...","Mythos has done it again. Some of the tracks in this CD will stir your soul. An ethereal mix of sublime vocals and piano. I have given 4 stars, because they could not live up to the stellar expectations after their previous album. Nevertheless, this is an excellent buy ..."
5,Mythos sound is reflected in each and every composition,"Mythos is the Canadian duo of Bob D'eith (piano) and Paul Schmidt (guitar) who, with the assistance of session musicians, created a 13 tack collecting blending ethereal, metaphysical qualities with motifs drawn from Jazz, Brazilian, Middle Eastern, and British Electronic influences. The unique Mythos sound is reflected in each and every composition and performance comprising Eternity who selections include: Ascent (3:38); Unity (4:20); Del Mar (3:42); Turn To Grey (3:54); Alpha (2:47); Exodus (4:39); Legends (1:50); Kyrie (4:34); Dreams of Jade (5:28); Paradise (3:46); Orca (5:47); Sixth Sense (2:34); and Freedom (4:02)."
1,Ugly book,"Buy it only if you haven't installed Exchange server help yet. If you have than read the help first and save money.(Bought it in Russian and checked in English to make sure that translation is correct. Well it's a copy of English book, unfortunately)"
3,Exchange Server 2003,Just started reading and already found incomplete information. So far I'm not real impreased.
3,Basic Book,"It is a good book for a novice .If you have some experience in Exchange 2000 , this book is not 'the choice'."
1,"Bad, bad, bad","A poorly written novel with unbelievably motivated characters. A word of advice, T.M.: take a beginning English class, learn how to write."
4,a serendipitous stumble,"I was in the Delaware USO and stumbled upon this book. I read it straight through and have never read anything like it. Although there are disturbingly vivid scenes it reads more like a science fiction work than horror. I don't know what genre to place it, but this work of fiction is imaginative, original, and offers a different opinion (well based) on the afterlife."
3,sleepeasy,"Very quirky book. This is my first book that I have read by T.M. Wright. It starts out when Harry Briggs dies and goes to a town called Silver Lake. He will meet some very odd characters along his journey and learn some of the rules of being a ghost. Mr. Wright fails to tie up all the loose ends (almost like there may be a sequel) and leaves the reader hanging.I like the P.I. aspects of the book and the humor. If you like horror and do not like ""blood and guts"" this may be for you."
2,Overated,"This was an intriguing idea but it seemed to be more suited to a short story than to a full length novel. The characters all seemed to be brief sketches, almost as if it was a first draft. Not one seemed fully developed.Finally I think it failed as a horror story because it failed to scare. No chills."
5,Excellent!,"These guys have been doing parodies since 1994, and, since 1997, have released a new CD almost every year. This CD, from 2000, is a great one. They've parodied some of the biggest songs from the 60s through today on this disk... From the opening lines of their ""theme song"", ""Play That Funny Music"", you can tell it's gonna be good. With parodies of Ricky Martin, The Beach Boys, Kid Rock, Santana, and more, there's not a bad song on this disk. If you like parodies, get this disk. You'll love it. This is the last CD with drummer Fred Bohanna."
4,Jazzmix,"This dvd is excellent, and well worth watching. A word of caution - you MUST be a jazz fan to even begin to appreciate the music. Definitely one of the best music dvd's I've watched n a while.Stand out performances from Ambrose Akinmusire, Jason Lindner, and Jaleel Shaw.Jamil - Cape Town, South Africa"
3,Good value,"No problems. I'm happy with the CMT chisel & bit sets. Chisel is sharp and can be sharpened. The bit seems a bit light, however."
1,oh Leslie,"First off, for those of you that like my reviews, you have probably noticed that I either totally like a movie, or totally despise it for killing brain cells. This, to those of you, is the latter. Mr Magoo, a retired idea from a retired cartoon, that neither should have made it past phase one. After you laugh at one thing (As Ebert said about Money Pit) you have nothing more to laugh at. The jokes are neither funny nor inspiring. New material is essential to the survival of a comedy. Unless, that is, you enjoy redundancy. Leslie Nielson, is one of my favorite comedians, (With the exception of the unnecessary Wrongfully accused, in which I laughed twice) and I have to say he was the best for the job. But, how unfortunate for him, that the material was plucked from an animated floozy. I am mr magoo, here is my chicken."
1,"THIS WAS VERY,VERY BORING AND I NEVER WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN","I watched this movie once and it was 5 minutes in and I hated it.You know the ratings on movies and books in ''Seventeen magizne'',well i give this poor.I really feel sorry for people who have to see this more than once.If you're looking for a good movie how 'bout Practical magic or scream.If you're younger how 'bout freaky friday or homeward bound."
1,Mr Magoofy,"This is the worst Disney movie, I have ever seen Leslie Neilson star in. He must have been very hard up for money to take this role.If you get the chance to spend your dollars on this . Please just throw the money in the trashcan."
1,very bad stuipd,I found it not as funny as they had said. it was a bad movie. i say you shoulden't see it.
3,It Could Be Entertaining. It Is Better The Second Time.,"It is one of those movies to watch when you have a Short-Attention-Span day. Don't analyze, just enjoy the occasional silly joke. And do not worry if you miss any part of the movie. You get used to it, it seems better the 2nd time."
1,"Not funny, not funny at all","I watched this back in 2000, and I must say that I wasn't amused. The jokers weren't funny, the slapstick was dry, and Leslie Nielsen didn't perform very well as Mr. Magoo. I believe it had lots of potential, but it looks like the screenwriter and director didn't really care for this. Oh well."
1,Mr. Magoo,"almost everyday I watch a new movie, and since more than 5 years I didn't watch something like this, this movie should have an academy award for the WORST MOVIE IN HISTORY OF CINEMA. here I took some notes from other people reviews and I think I can not say anything more:1 - The dog was the best actor of all 2 - In the worst performance of his career, Leslie Nielsen stars in Mr. Magoo 3- it's hard to believe that movies as bad as this actually get made.I couldn't believe how Leslie Nielsen agreed and signed a contract for this movie I've always considered him one of the best Comedy actors and I didn't believed that he worked in this movie.bottom line : 1.10 hours waste of time."
1,One joke can't carry a movie.,"At cartoon-length, Mr. Magoo is hilarious. The animated opening sequence is the best part of the movie. But dragging it out over 90 minutes and trying to make it work in live-action? Big mistake. Leslie Nielsen is a little too perky to be a convincing Mr. Magoo, anyway."
1,"ugh, an awful movie!","no offense to the director, but this was a purely awful movie. Unless you love stupid humor, you should not see this. all the ""comedy"" is based on the same premis, that mr. magoo cant see well. i could barely sit throgh the movie because of the one-sided characters and the pathetic plot."
1,Boring!,"I mean, if a , tv show, or a newspaper or anything like that just says: ""Zany!"", ""Fun!"", ""Thrills!"", or ""Slapstick!"", it usually mean they hated it and were either payed to say these things or they were looking for something possitive(unlikley!)"
2,Mr. Mediocrity,This is definitely a botched opportunity. The plot involving a stolen jewel is too tedious for adults. It's also too complicated for children to enjoy. Sole redeeming qualities are Leslie Nielsen's game performance as the title character and an effervessant Jennifer Garner in an early role. Doesn't even qualify as a decent waste of time. The late great Jim Backus is probably rolling in his grave.
3,good premise but very slow and boring,"I can't believe this got rave reviews as I found the plot slow and boring actually. Story is set in 1662; Susannah is a Quaker teen who finds herself drawn to Will, a well educated young man not suited for her, as her mother thinks. The plot takes the reader into the solid characters of Quaker society and while that part is interesting, it just falls flat on the rest of the novel. There were way too many THEES and THOUS for me to get past and enjoy. That part seemed too overdone."
2,Not enough sex! :-),"There were two fabulous scenes in this lesbian erotica book but the rest of story was mediocre. I wish the author would have expanded on the first three pages instead of going into the somewhat mundane world of a young butch being seduced by a bar owner and a lesbian erotica writer.To be frank, the book needed to have a lot more sex in it and a lot less talking. What was especially disappointing is I didn't a find the lead character, 'Bobbie' very interesting OR sexy. I recommned this book only for the first 3 pages and a scene located in the early middle of the book, involving a young woman being initiated into the ways of sapphic love . . . . If your looking for a 'hot' book, this only warmed my fires a couple times. Too bad."
1,Garbage,Really bad. Dont waste your time. I could have spent my time doing sometthing better. I watched it on netflix. What a waste of time
2,Lost In The Intrails,"I liked this movie, but there was too much killing and disembowelment. Most of the movie was a mystery, only revealed to us at the end. Too close to the end for my taste. The unravelling did not slowly develop. This is yet another low budget, B-rated movie, with no-name actors, but the actors did a good job. The idea of the story was a good one. The emplimintation was lacking. But I have seen much worse and would gladly watch this one again. We should have seen what happened to the boyfriend of the surviving teen at the end. The sister of the killer, while quite a character was useless. A letter from her could have substituted.Knock! Knock! Who's there? A good story gone awry."
1,SImply as awful as it gets,I have nothing to say about this film except to say I got 7 minutes in and could not take it. Laughable. An absolute POS.
3,"Just as the cover says ""everything a slasher fan could want""","This movie has gotten mostly bad reviews, which I think are unfair. Nothing but an average flick, no better no worse. The story isn't that original (manic victim back from revenge, who ALSO escaped from the mental institution) and the acting isn't that great, but how many horror movies suffer from this same fate. If you want a good late night watch, this one isn't so bad, but I would maybe buy it if it was a used rental or you find it cheaper than the listing price. $13 may be too much"
3,What happened?! You had a good story!,"This movie has a good story, but it wasn't clearly told. The editing could have been better and would have improved the pace. Mastrantonio is very convincing, perhaps too strong for his counterpart. I'm surprised they didn't list his name on the product details here in amazon.A good storyline should not be lost on the grounds that there's a ""formula"" that tells you that two shower scenes and a lot of blood sells. Could have been a really good movie."
2,Knock Knock..Whos There? WHO CARES,"Knock Knock had all good intentions.a good story ,a great tag line.Too bad the characters were so unbelievable..Like the big breasted blonde bimbo for the police detective""Yea ok"".The killings were done in fast motion so you couldn't really see what was going on most of the time although there were a couple of redeeming kill sceneslike the blow torch and the shower scene.The acting was off the charts bad..and it was very predictable..The mask the killer used was like a generic Leather face mask..I only bought this because I was in WalMart and needed a movie to watch and I saw a copy of this and cover and the pics in the back made it look good as did the synopsis.but NOT.."
1,Punishment for your eyes,"This movie is an abomination on filmmaking. The acting is an absolute joke, the story makes hardly any sense and the continuity is just horrible. There is a reason that the director has done nothing sense and all the actors have done nothing of note ever before or after. If you can avoid this abortion of filmmaking then do so. And if somebody can tell me if they are in the south or New York I would really like to know because the accents make no sense to me what so ever."
1,"Knock,Knock.","Knock,Knock...Who's there? nothing another slasher movie and one of the worst.Think Jersey shore meets slasher or annoying new york goodfella accents,the actors,acting is horrible,and the excessive violence and intentional blood and gore can't save it. I had nothing to do and watched it. It had a good story and yes smoking hot chicks too but the movie really really is bad."
4,Worthwhile Investment,"Unlike the Sony, LG and Samsung DVD recorders I tried, this one actually works right every single time when burning dual layer discs. Those other units could only burn about 5% of the dual layer DVD's I used, where as the Panasonic has yet to have a failure. Picture quality is good, plenty of input and output options and the fact that it works every time is a major plus. Highly recommended!"
3,Panasonic DMR-EZ27 DVD-recorder,"So far I am fairly happy with this machine. I have not yet done much editing of my family tapes onto DVDs (really, the ONLY reasonable purpose for one of these machines), but it seems at once powerfull and simple enough to use. It has pretty good upconversion of DVDs to 1080p, but then so does my Denon amp.On the downside, this machine has a fairly steep learning curve vis-a-vis editing features. In addition, it is VERY slow to start up and, in an astonishingly stupid move, has no open/close button on the remote! You must go to the machine and push that button. Fortunately, I have a Harmony universal remote which DOES allow me to open and close the DVD drawer. Go figure. It has DIVx capabilities, but these work intermittently for no good reason.Would I buy it again? Probably not. I'd wait for the Bluray version (if such a thing ever comes out) to be able to play AND record in that format."
1,Is there any QC at Panasonic?,"This product quit working 20 days after it was received, will not show on TV and the DVD door will not open."
3,Not really HDTV,"I was so hopeful to have the 2 devices I need (DVD player, HDTV tuner) in a single device, but it wasn't to be. As is the case with the DMR-EZ17 (no HDMI) and a recent LG recorder, this unit only outputs TV at 480p even though it has a digital tuner. This is a huge disappointment, and I'll definitely be returning it. Also, you can't play 4:3 content in 4:3 mode, unless you go into the setup and change the TV type to 4:3. Many recent DVD players seem to be like this, and it's stupid. There is a lot of 4:3 content available that I don't want stretched to 16:9. All players should have a zoom function that let's you increase the viewing area a small bit at a time. The Oppo 981 lets you. Then again, it costs about 2x what most players do.As for the recording capability, I haven't tried it since I already decided I would not keep it. However, I have read that it records multi-channel audio in stereo only, another limitation. Why do they do this? Is there some legal reason?"
1,Don't buy this or the EZ28,Like many other reviewers I found this worked perfectly at the beginning but after a year or so things started to go wrong. Distorted pictures and sound then nothing. Panasonic technical support couldn't help and only suggestion was to return it (at my expense) and pay $160 to get it fixed.I have many other very good Panasonioc products but their DVD (as well as DVD/VCR) recorders are ruining their reputation.
3,Good start for a player/recorder,For the money I expected a little better performance. Overall it's a good start. Things I didn't like was no button on remote to open/close the drive door. Remote seems sluggish when pressing keys. Start-up time is slow. I'm not big into buying/renting movies or recording tv programs. I just wanted a system so if/when I need to do so.
2,It's can be better,"I had a Panasonic DMR-55 dvd recorder and it was excelent dvd recorder for 3 years, but I decided changed it for a panasonic DMR-EZ27K, I really made mistake, because it is a very low quality: The time in the clock is easy missing, some time it don't recorder pictures that I scherduled weekly, and the worse thing is that some times the DMR-EZ27K is freezing and I turned off the power for recorver the image. Pnasonic must be checking this product."
1,Don't do it.,"This item should never have been brought to market. Would you buy this device if you knew that within a few months, just after your opportunity for a hassle-free refund expired, there would be a <10% chance that your scheduled recordings would work? Or that this device would FREEZE without explanation repeatedly, even with Panasonic RAM discs. Those were my experiences last year. Don't do it. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk.This item scores a rating of 1 star...on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. Unfortunately, zero stars ain't an option on this website."
3,Glitchy Performance,"I'm still a little nervous about this purchase. I have 'scheduled' about 6 programs to record. Only 3 of the 6 have actually recorded the program. I watched it closely the last time it failed. The set blinks as if it is starting to record, but the timer never starts ticking off the time, like it does when it records successfully. Hmmmm ... anyone's guess as to whether it will record that future program. When it does record, the picture is very good. I have a 1080 37"" LCD television, and I had previously read that the upconversion is over-rated. I disagree. I have watched the same DVD on this new Panasonic with a HDMI connection, and it is a noticeable improvement over the same picture from my old Sony DVD player with the standard connection (no upconversion). However, if I had to do it over, I would probably wait for better technology. Or look into recording those occasional HD programs on the computer."
1,eddkbrown,"An absolute piece of trash. I sent it back after a month for repair of the DVD player. No cost to me fortunately, but the tuner is garbage and the machine constantly requires a reset (note: Never buy anything with a reset button on it. It means the company new this product was not ready for market.) Never know if it will record or crash. I won't even look at anything with the name Panasonic on after wasting $250 on this. Doesn't deserve one star!"
3,Ups and downs...,"This item records well, but the menus take a couple of seconds to come up, and they're not well-organized when they do. The entire unit takes 15-20 seconds to power up and accept commands from the remote (say you're turning it on, then trying to view the DVD menu on a disc you've recorded), and like many DVD recorders, it will refuse to copy a manufacturer's original VHS. So if you want to turn those old VHS copies of your favorite Hollywood movies into DVDs, you don't want this recorder. Honestly, this is a stupid function, and if I would have known about it, I would have purchased a different brand that didn't infringe on my legal right to make a backup copy of a movie I already own. I haven't tried to record from HBO or anything like that, but recordings from PBS, SciFi, History Channel, and a few other cable channels have come out fine.It's not a bad recorder, but there's plenty of room for improvement."
2,Worked fine for just three weeks,"There is a design or manufacturing flaw in this model. I've since found from Circuit City's owner comments at their website that many other people have had this happen. During a timer recording, the unit froze up and would not reboot or release the DVR-RW trapped inside. My unit is now at Panasonic's service facility in Illinois. Although I've owned four other Panasonic DVD recorders that had no problems, I strongly recommend against purchasing this particular model."
1,bad packaging,"If you buy something from j and r all the will do is put your item in gray plastic bag and ship it. The packaging sucks, the packaging from the original manufacturer is the only packaging protection you get. I get a warm fuzzy feeling when I hold my DVD recorder up to the ceiling and hear things moving around on the inside. I guess it is perfectly normal for electronic components to settle while shipping.Thank YouNewegg Customer"
3,Black prince with light skin?,"When I asked my daughter what color skin she would like her boy doll to be- light, medium or dark?She enthusiastically said, ""Dark, I want him to have dark skin!""It was a birthday gift that I ordered from my phone so the image of him was small.They did try to get the hair right but, I was disappointed about how light he turned out to be. She noticed that him and her beach barbie have the same color, but she would never complain.He also needs hard boots, not long socks. I'm not a barbie doll supporter really, so this just confirms how I feel about the brand overall."
1,"nice concept, but terrible monitoring system","I tried two of these monitors, hoping that the first was just a bad item, however when the second did the same thing, ToysRUs took it back. The box is a nightmare to get the thing out first of all, and they want you to return it in the box. The monitor clicks, and we did try this all over the house. We even unplugged our cordless phones and computers to see if that was the problem which it was not. It also jumps off channel, and leaves a horrible static sound. I did like the rechargable battery concept, the walkie talkie concept, and the ability to monitor three rooms, however it is just not worth the headaches. I did exchange this for the Sony which is amazing, as per other reviewers."
1,Very Dissapointing,"I was very excited that I found this monitor system. I read the reviews and thought with 3 1/2 stars it could not be that bad. We have a large home and had to move our daughter to the other end of the house to get the new baby close to our room. When we tested the monitors you can not hear anything with the volume on max. We tried different channels thinking it would be better but it was not. She talked quietly and you could not even here her and also turned a radio on and it could not be heard. I just did not feeel comfortable using this system with a newborn baby that you want to be able to hear breathe in the middle of the night. We also received the Safety 1st glow monitor and it is wonderful just like our old one. You can hear our daughter breathe, rollover and any tiny sound that may happen in the room. And this is set on a medium volume. My opinion is do not waste your money on this product when you can get one that works 100 times better for $100 less."
2,Great idea but poor quality,"I was so excited to find this product. I have two children under 2 years of age and really wanted a monitor with two base units - and this one has three! I purchased it thinking it would be worth the hefty price tag, but unfortunately I was wrong.This monitor had a constant static-y hum and would periodically crackle loudly, which was very annoying compared to the monitor I used to have that was completely silent. I might have been willing to deal with that except I could barely hear my children even with the volume turned all the way up. I was used to hearing my son breathing over our old monitor, but with this one I could only hear him well if he was crying loudly. I couldn't believe how low the maximum volume was!This monitor was definitely not worth the price considering the poor quality - it was almost worthless! I returned it and am going to try using two different monitors instead."
1,This company makes faulty monitors,"Another reviewer wrote: ""I wanted it to work!"" and so did I! One of the parent receivers never worked and when I called Safety first they asked me to send it to them and they'd replace it but ""it would take a while."" Two months later the second receiver died, and I still hadn't replaced the first one. I called and asked for a refund and they tried to convince me to pay for shipping it back to them! If you buy this and have problems, DEMAND that they send you a return postage label! After I got rid of those (still no refund yet, by the way!) I purchase a Safety First monitor at the other end of the price spectrum: $16.00 I know, WHY would I do that? Long story...but the end result was: THAT DIDN'T WORK EITHER!This company has poor quality products."
2,Disappointed!!,"We are expecting twins, so we were really excited to find this product. We hooked it up--it has some really nice features like a walkie talkie, 2 parent sets, and a rechargable battery in the parent sets. One of our parent sets simply didn't work--all static!! Several others reviwers mentioned to simply read the directions. Well, we are pretty tech savvy, and we certainly know to have the monitors on the same channel! There is just a lot of static, and one simply didn't pick up a signal from the baby set. Also, it isn't very loud. You would have to have the volume up full blast to hear a baby cry. It also interfered with our cordless phone despite the channel we picked. Save your money and buy something cheaper!"
1,Mother of 2,"I thought this monitor set would solve all our problems -- ability to listen to 2 children and have receivers in different rooms. Yes, it does that but there is a lot of static and the receiver had to be turned up too high in order to hear the kids. The scanning feature was a big disappointment -- probably the biggest disappointment with this unit. The scanning feature allows you to listed to each monitor for a few seconds each. Problem is, if you are only using 2 of the 3 units then you will hear unit 1, unit 2 and then static for the unit not being used. That is very annoying. It should only scan units currently in use -- or at least not deliver static for the unit not used.In short, this unit offers more than is delivered."
1,The Monitor that keeps me up,I couldnt belive it when I saw this monitor I thought it was purfect until I got it hom then threw away the recipt (big mistake) and the box (trash day too.) This Monitor is the worst monitor I have ever seen. Sure the set up is ok and it is versible but all night it makes this anoying clicking noise. The reception is horrible! When my phone rings it goes crazy! (Click...Click....Click)This thing Has kept me up every night since I have owned it. I do not recomend spending the amount of money on this monotor. I'm going to buy a 20.00 dollor one today!
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!!!!,"Could only stand it for two days - had to return . . . Lots and lots of static, popping, and chirping. I could barely even hear the baby, even with the volume turned all the way up. Plus, the volume control broke on one monitor and a light burned out on the other monitor, all within two days of getting it home. Couldn't have been interference with other devices because I unplugged everything in my house and still had problems. Would never ever recommend this product to anyone - deserves a 0 star. I have ordered the Sony 27 channel monitor and will hopefully have better luck!"
1,Horrible - save your money,With two children this looked like the perfect system - but we were extremely wrong. It has horrible static on every station and we were constantly getting interference coming across. Do not waste your time or money on this system - it is absolutely terrible!
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This monitor is terrible! I bought this one because I live in a 2-story home, and thought it would be great because I could have receivers and monitors in different locations upstairs and downstairs. Yes, that part was fine, but all the static wasn't what I needed. I tried to change all the channels on every monitor and receiver, but still got static, plus an additional beeping sound every 15 seconds. I can't get any sleep with all that noise. This is the worst product you can buy for the money. I'm hoping the new Sony monitor will work better; it seems to have the best reviews."
4,Just what we were looking for.,"I am very pleased with the 900 MHz Connection Monitor. The last monitor I owned picked up so much static that the volume had to be turned low enough that I couldn't hear my child. Now that I have twins and a toddler I needed more than one monitor. This one works great with little static. Only occasionally I will hear a few odd noises but it's always during the day when it doesn't really matter anyway. The info guide says to plug in all 3 monitors to reduce any static and I did have to do this, so I just put the extra one in my toddlers bathroom and it works fine. My husband and I have also used the two receiver/walkie talkies around the house while we are remodeling (came in handy while checking for electric from breaker box). I also like the way it allows you to listen to one room or scan for all three."
2,mom of 3 princesses,"This monitor was great for about a year. I had a 2 yr old ,a 1 year old and a newborn all in different rooms. Once the baby turned one, the monitor turned to pure static. Yes you can still hear the baby cry through the static, but it is so annoying! I'm trying to figure out how to contact the manufacturer for help in fixing it."
2,"Good concept, bad performance","I received this monitoring system as a gift and I really like that it has 2 parent units and 3 room monitors. The major problems I have had with this monitor include one of the parent units not working and excessive static, even on the second channel. I also hate the lights on the parent monitor. They are VERY bright, and at first, I had a really hard time sleeping with them on. The blue light seems to be the brightest. I did call the company regarding the faulty parent unit and they gave me no hassel on the phone and said they would ship a new one out. I still have not received it, however, and it has been nearly 2 months!!!"
1,Everything I wanted but all I got was static,"We too were looking for exactly what this monitor said it had to offer. The multiple units and walkie talkie feature is a great idea, but it's too bad it doesn't work. The constant static, clicking noises and lack of sensitivity all contributed to me returning this product to the store today. We tried unplugging every cordless phone in the house, repositioning it in the rooms and changing the channels, but nothing ever worked. I too thought for this price I really must be getting everything, but all I got was static."
1,Too Many Problems!!!!,"We read the reviews of this product already posted, which were mixed (some liked it and others did not). However, the monitor was ideal for our 3-level town home and we thought that we'd give it a chance, hoping that the problems mentioned in the reviews would not surface.Unfortunately, the first night we turned the monitor on, the problems started. The clicking on the receivers started as well as the loud, consistent static, both difficult to sleep through (most of the nights we turned the monitor off).Less than two weeks after we bought the monitor, at our earliest convenience, we are returning it!! Happy monitoring and believe the reviews you read!"
3,Loved it until...,"I loved this monitor, a great solution for someone with two young children, until it started broadcasting ESPN at night! I have e-mailed Safety 1st, so we'll see what they say, but it was very disturbing to be awoken at 1am by a football game broadcast--like I get enough sleep anyway!!"
4,Great monitor for split level homes,"As a mother of twins in a split level home with a dog, we are constantly on zone defense. This monitor is very helpful with keeping an ear out for one twin, communicating with my husband, and listening for the comings and goings of our Lab. You can keep tabs on all floors extremely well with this system. There is no interference and the small size make it very descreet in rooms (you have to remind guest they are there or it could lead to embarassing moments).While it is very helpful, the volume on the adult monitors is not very loud. If you do not have the monitor on you and you walk out of the room (or over another vocal child or a barking dog) you may not hear it. That aside, they are the best I have found."
1,"Great Idea, poor execution!",We are expecting our second child soon so we will have 2 under the age of 2. I was so excited to find this monitor. It looked like the answer to our monitor needs. Unfortunately.... I will be returning this monitor today. The sound is terrible. It has some static but the problem is mostly that it not sensitive enough for me. My son has to nearly scream for me to hear him clearly. I was previously using the Fisher-Price 900 MHz and I could hear amazingly clear. I'm so glad I tested it out before I had to use it with my newborn. I am not comfortable with the very poor sound quality of this monitor.
1,"Great idea, bad product. Save your money!","The idea is perfect but these monitors are not made properly. No matter what we did or what advise the company gave us we could barely hear anything thru these monitors. The monitor was with in 2 feet of the kids beds and yet even with the volume turned ALL the way up we could hardly hear them on our end! Again, its a wonderful idea but these just don't work right."
2,Very Dissappointed Parents,"This product was given to us for our baby shower, we were so excited about it that we decided to try it out that night. We placed it in our 2 year old's room to see if it would work, unfortunately we got nothing but lots of static, we couldn't hear anything, my husband and I even went in the room and talked to see if we could hear something but we didn't. Needless to say we returned it the very next day and purchased a less expensive fisher-price monitor that worked a lot better. Save your money!!!!"
2,What a disappointment!,"I was looking so forward to taking advantage of having a monitor in three rooms, but if we use our cordless phone or cell phone the monitor goes crazy. Also at night we have to put the volume all the way up due to all the static that comes through. I am going to Babies R Us tomorrow morning and buying Baby Call by Sony. It is only $49.99 and rated one of the best in Consumer Report. I truly believe this was a waste of $129.99 that could have been spent on somrthing worth while."
2,Great concept - but didn't live up to promise,"Thought this would be great for us when 2nd child was born. (we currently have a fisher price Sounds and Lights) But much to our disappointment, proved to be incompatible w/900 mghz phones and whatnot - even when not placed near phones. There was so much static - no matter what we did - as well as loud buzzing. I should note we live in private house - so there was not interference from neighbor's monitors. You have to monitor 1 or 3 zones - can't just monitor 2. Also, the most wasteful packaging I have ever seen for a product of this size! We returned it and purchased a sony 900 mghz with a lot of frequencies to choose from. Great idea for a home system - but poor execution."
1,This monitor is HORRID!,"We saved up to buy this monitor after the birth of our second child. We got it 2 weeks ago, and are already on our second one. The first one had a receiver that stopped working properly within a week. We exchanged it for another one, which also lasted about a week before it started having horrible and unexplainable static out of nowhere. I'll be returning it ASAP for a refund and will go back to using 2 different (less expensive!) monitors instead. Side note -- someone else was at the same store returning this monitor for being faulty the first time we went back as well. Definitely don't waste your time or your money on this monitor -- it doesn't work!"
2,Monitor interferes with too many other products,"The idea was great...but the monitors make terribly sounds if I turn on the microwave, use my cordless phone, use my cell phone, or use any other baby monitor..."
1,Way to quiet!!,"I read all the reviews for this product but hoped that I would get the one that acutally worked. Not the case. I didnt have any problems with static. We have a newborn and a fourteen month old. The baby was crying and I could not even hear it on the monitor with the volume turned all the way up. I returned it the next day. The reason you are paying so much money for this monitor is the packaging. The packaging alone for this monitor is atleast $25 of the cost. Any way dont buy it,it doesent work. I have no idea how long my poor baby was crying that night. I wouldnt recommend this piece of garbage to my worst enemy. The only reason I gave this monitor 1 star is because I had to. In my book it gets no stars."
2,NOT WORTH IT!!,"Despite the negative feed back we read we let the few positives out way them and gave it a try. Well we are on our second child and thought the concept would be great, how wrong we were. Save your money and buy 2 cheaper monitors, the volume on the reciever when all the way up is less than a whisper, we can hear the kids in the other room on our own before we can hear them on the monitor. The interferance or static was not a problem with this monitor, but you do need superb hearing to hear anything coming out of the reciever."
4,Static and no sound,"I got this for the same reason everyone else did 2 kids in different roomS and I want to be able to hear them both. I love this Monitor its a great idea if you are lucky to not have static while you are using it. Also most of the time one of my recevers wouldent let me hear noise coming from the ""A"" monitor the only way I knew my son was making noise was the light being lit up. I have since swiched the monitor recevers cords that had helped now no problems but, still static. Whats a mom to do!!!"
1,Horrible,I loved the concept since we have two kids under the age of 2 but both monitors broke after a couple of months. One kept on having static and the other monitors lights did not work. The idea is great but too bad the product did not live up to its promise. I ended up buying two separate monitors that added up to be less expensive and work better.
1,more hassle than it's worth,"I have a baby and a toddler in two bedrooms. I thought this sounded like a great idea. It is not. The monitor is extremely sensitive to interference through ANY electrical devices in your home. I practically unplugged my entire home trying to find what caused the interference, and never completely resolved the problems. Even with the volume very high, the sound was too faint (except for static). Also, I did not like the fact that the scan feature must scan all three monitors, you can't have it scan only two rooms. I returned it, and for a lot less money bought two separate monitors that work great with no interference or static."
2,Older version was much better,"The old version of Bicycle Gin Rummy was much better, but no longer works in new ""windows"". The new version is much smaller and cannot be enlarged. In the new version, the cards cannot be moved so that sequences can easily be seen.It is a bit confusing to try to see matches because of that. The cards are so small, it is very hard to distinguish between suits of the same color. The game is more of a chore than fun."
2,Disappointing,"I have to agree with J. F. Kyte's review.Even though the Rules say there is an option allowing you to lay cards on your opponent's sets, it's not there.You also can't play double suits when laying down cards, ven though there's supposed to be an option to allow it.Graphics are poor. It's nearly impossible to read your opponents sets on the table."
4,Good story but the writing style is a little dry,I did enjoy reading this book and didn't know how tumultuous a start the company had. The middle starts to drag and I had to read it in small bites to get through it. It is like a transcribed documentary film instead of a well-told story. But the evolution from pure startup to billion-dollar company is a great case study for anyone.
5,You must read and share,It touched my heart. It changed my perspective. It stayed in my mind forever. Please read it and share it.
2,Biography of A Hypocrite,"This is Ritter's own story of ""Coveneant House"", a place of refuge for street children who have nowhere else to turn. He goes into detail describing the life of children forced out onto the streets, and his plans for saving them. He refers to Dr. Ruth Westheimer here as the ""high priestess of hedonism"" as if sex education and sexual perversion go hand in hand! Many of his ideas are ridiculous and certainly coloured by his religious beliefs, but for all his efforts, it is hard to take him seriously now, because, as it turned out, he was one of the child molesters that he campaigned so hard against! Although Coveneant House of fortunately still finctional without him, one wonders whether his concern for the street children of the U.S. was really for their own benefits or just an old man's attempts to get them into his own hands for his own sexual cravings."
1,Extremely disappointing quality,"I bought this to replace a 10 year old TUMI that was still fully functional, but tired looking. Within 3 months, the cording was fraying and sticking out, the zipper pulls broke and came off and one zipper broke altogether. Hartmann apparently does not warranty this item, and informed me that the bag was constructed 'at an outsourced facility overseas' and they were unable to repair the physical problems. They did finally agree to fix the zipper pulls, after informing me that they were doing it as an ACCOMMODATION but I had to pay the shipping. To sum up, stay away, buy something else, don't waste your money on this overpriced piece of shoddy craftsmanship and take note of the begrudging customer service and absence of warranty."
2,Not what we expected,Got this for a 12 hour trip. It is full of activities for older kids. Not really a family thing and definitely not something the driver can be included in.
3,Unfinished Sanding Block,"I beleive it is a factory second, the wood was not finshed, the hole drilled to accept the screw holding it togetherwas not centerd needed plyers to get it apart.Carl White"
5,A great and economical product line,"Having had poor luck with KitchenAid utensils, I switched to Oxo. Then, a year ago, I discovered that Caphalon was introducing utensils with an orientation to non-stick cookware. I started buying these and now have a slight preference for Caphalon over Oxo where they have similar offerings. Caphalon's utensils are elegant, well-made, and highly functional, including this turner. And their pricing is hard to beat."
3,Handy turner,This turner is handy when cooking with Teflon pans. However it is a little thick for turning thin food items.
5,Calphalon Nylon All Purpose Turner,The item arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I'm pleased with Amazon and my item. thx! Patricia
2,Not so impressed.,"I had high hopes for this tuner, as I usually like most Calphalon products. The biggest problem is that it is not heat resistant, as advertised. The lip (the edge) of the tuner frayed up and split after only one or two uses. And it's too thick to be used for a lot of purposes. And the handle is too wide to fit nicely in a jar, upright. So - not really great for my needs at all."
3,"the lip is too thick, but it's a nice compact size.","Length:: 0:35 Minsyeah, it looks good, but sometimes I have a difficult time flipping patties. I wish the lip would have been narrower. Sounds minor, but it's a bigger deal than it sounds.on a positive note,this turner is great for eggs, and matches the Calphalon pans. Finally, I love the compact narrow size. It doesn't take up a lot of space in the clean dish rack next to the sink.Overall, it's just okay."
3,Fine Kitchen Tool,"A recent purchase of some high end non-stick cookware prompted a hunt for a non-steel turner.In all, this Calphalon turner works well, but I would have like to see a thinner lip at the end to help with sliding under things, such as the fried eggs I usually make in these pans.It's my own fault for not buying a wider version, but from the picture (which is the best) it looked as if it would be wide enough.Overall, it's a fine tool, but nothing I was overly impressed with when I pulled it from the box and put it to use."
1,Can't stand high heat,"I bought this turner to replace my stainless steel turner so it wont scratch my pans and wok. But only after a few days of cooking (stir frying) i saw that the turner is already melting on the tip. I don't know the degree or temp of the pan, but it shouldnt be a problem because how can I watch the temp when I am cooking all the time. I will definitely not recommend this to my friends."
1,Do Not Buy!,"Complete waste of money! I bought the Calphalon turner with the pan - LOVE the pan, but the turner, after 2-weeks' use, is peeling and chipping off the bottom edge! If zero stars were a possibility, that's how I would rate it!"
2,Falling apart and peeling after a few months,Within 6 months this turner is starting to degrade. It does seem to play properly with my nonstick pan but I don't think this was a worthwhile investment in the end.
5,It's uh. A spatula.,"It's definitely a spatula. I like Calphalon's products... Just a little smaller than I expected but good design. It's a spatula. It works.Ok. After having it a while I got more to say. Firstly, the tip of it has places where it melted and now has rough edges. Secondly, the grip has begun to come loose and pops out of the handle from time to time. Not enough to make me replace it... yet. But far below the standard I've come to expect from Calphalon after using their knives (I have a calphalon cleaver and chef's knife that I *LOVE*) and their cookware (Bought my mom some pans that are super sturdy and she likes them very well). Moral: Calphalon makes great pans and knives but (in this instance at least) fall a bit short of the mark on their spatulas. Won't stop me from buying their products though."
1,Turner,DO NOT BUY THIS item either... either the pancake or the all purpose turner melted on the FIRST use. I bought the t-fal frying pan (which is great) but these calphalon spoons are not made to use with heat.
5,I.C.B.I.C.M.,I Can't Believe It's Christian Music! - Apologetix has taken Rock n Roll classics and soon to be classics and turned them in to GREAT Christian music. These guys have taken contemporary music and made it into music my whole family enjoys. I've even used their songs as part of my elementary Sunday School lessons. Great music and great lyrics - I.C.B.I.C.M!
5,This One Rocks,"Biblical Graffiti, with its parodied rock songs from the 50's-90's, takes some songs with awesome music and changes the lyrics to words that lift up Jesus. It's hearing Bible history in a whole new and fun way."
5,Great spoofs,"This cd released in 1999 , is great and one of Apologetix's best it include parodys of mordern rock songs like,Dropping on the sun (parody of ""walking on the sun"" by Smashmouth) Fast paul (parody of ""the way"" by Fastball) Put you down in my will (parody of ""push"" by Matchbox 20) it also includes parody's of classic rock songs like, Twins came out (parody of ""twist and shout"" by the Beatles) Donky talked with him (parody of ""honky tonk women"" by the Rolling stones) Revelation man (parody of ""secret agent man"" by Jonny rivers) and, Jail got rocked (parody of ""jailhouse rock"" by Elvis Presly) other songs include,Enter samson (parody of ""enter sandman"" by Metalica) Smart blest man (parody of ""sharp dressed man"" by ZZ top) and, Bends to low places (parody of ""freinds in low places"" by Garth brooks) getthis cd if you like Apologetix or parodys"
3,Creepy Crawlers From Space,"The scare factor from this episode of the revived ""Outer Limits"" is watching Bridges' scientist character slide into delusions of grandeur after sneaking out a life form from the lab he works at to cultivate on his own. When the creatures perform acts of mayhem, this is still not enough for the scientist to stop. Will make you wonder the next time you are out in the woods and see an insect you can't quite identify."
1,buyer beware,Buyer beware was a big fan of this before they stopped making this 750 a bottle seemed great price to bad I didn't realize it was a .033 size bottle not only that all 3 I ordered came in 1 package and it cost me13.99 for shipping to Ohio I thought it was a bigger bottle because it was the bigger bottle in the picture it has a rubber handle so much for consumer protection laws and rules about false advertising I used a little and go figure was not even the original scent but a knock off that won't wash off and stings the eyes it does do not trust these snake oil peddlers I am goin to request a refund they can keep there wee little bottles of horse urine for their in laws birthday party enough said
3,"It's fragile, but it should be fun.","I bought this for a friend and haven't given it to him yet so I wasn't very sure about how to rate this toy, but I did open it to add a note inside so I've played with it a little, but not too much because I was afraid I'd scramble the boxes and won't be able to fix it. But when I handled the toy, it felt pretty fragile but I don't think it would have fallen apart after a couple of days of play. It would probably break if it fell from the hands of someone though. I guess my friend would just have to be careful. This toy looks pretty challenging and fun though."
2,no.,get a speed cube 5x5 even if you dont speed cube its better quality. i recommend a shengshou 5x5 .
2,corner cube broke off on the first turn.,"Our 11 year old, who is proficient with the lower cubes, opened the package and made one twist and the corner broke off. Need to return it and hopefully this was just one bad one."
3,The knockoffs are all better,"To be honest, for an original, I'm disappointed at the quality of these cubes. The 5x5x5s that many of the knockoff companies produce are much better in quality and durability. They turn better, the stickers stay on, they're quieter, and they don't feel fragile. While I do recommend the puzzle, I do not recommend the Rubik's version of it. The Sheng-shou, while being a knockoff, is much higher quality.Source: I have both, and have used both extensively."
5,I don't like titling reviews.,"Like all Rubik's, it does take a good bit of time to break in for nice smooth movement. The 5x5 works precisely as expected, and was a lot of fun to work. Due to the shape and shear number of layers, the 5x5 does take a little extra care in moving - it is easy to have one row just far enough out of line to prevent a turn. Also, and important to note, due to the design it is possible to get a few of the squares in particular (think second row second column) twisted if you attempt to turn it while slightly misaligned. This hasn't caused any damage to mine, as we've always caught it beforehand - but someone just wrenching on your cube could easily twist one of these pieces off."
3,"Fun, but not built well.","I have loved Rubik's cubes since the 80s when I was a kid. They are a lot of fun and they help develop/refine spatial reasoning. This is a great toy, but I am NOT impressed with the quality.The cube is difficult to turn, the stickers peel off, and I constantly have the cube bind. If I were to try to solve the cube very fast, I would probably shatter the thing and be left wondering how to put it back together. I have had a couple of pieces pop out while working with it, but since I was going slow it was easy to pop the piece back in.My son bought the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 from Eastsheen. It is a much better cube and a better size for the hand. I would hightly recommend the Eastsheen cube, but I am only luke warm to the Winning Moves brand."
3,Hard ti move,The spins are Very hard to do I can not imagine a kid using this toy it has a great potencial but the difficult to move it kill a everything I Will try with another 5x5x5
1,"""Okay"" when it first came out, but has been made obsolete by better versions.","I've been involved in competitive Rubik's Cube speedsolving since 2008 and when I purchased this cube back then, it was one of the few mass-produced cubes available (the other two produced by Meffert's and Eastsheen). While I was able to do solves in under 5 minutes without breaking it, even with lubrication (using silicone), it doesn't turn particularly smoothly, it's quite heavy, the included stickers will begin to deteriorate almost immediately upon use, and if you're not careful when solving, it will break.For your money, you're better off purchasing the V-Cube 5 (which can cost a bit more). The V-Cube has better quality stickers, is more robust, turns much more smoothly, and is a much better quality product overall."
4,i like it,"This is alot of fun, easier than the 4x4 i think. Its really fragile and the inside corners pop out. I super glued one back together and it has stayed. I heard that the other manufacturers make more durable ones."
1,"Very fragile, broken after 30 minutes' play","I bought a 4*4 and returned it.For this one, I thought I would get better luck.However, it is more fragile and got broken after 30 minutes' play.Such as bad experience with the products from this seller!!"
3,A handful,"The 5x5 is much more difficult than the 3x3 but it has lost some of the fun edge. Turning the sides has become a burden and is slow. They need to be perfectly lined up and unlike the three sided cube, it must be realigned constantly. This cube is difficult and requires different moves than the 3x3 so if you are looking for a challenge than pick this up but if fun and a quick mental challenge is what you are looking for stick with the 3x3."
3,For the price I expected more,"The product is quite expensive. but the pieces are almost breaking, the colors are just stickers - ready to fall. I expected more from for the price I payed"
4,Fun with durable stickers,"I bought this 5x5 Rubik's cube for my brother for Christmas. He has solved the 3x3 and 4x4 before, so he was really excited to get this one. He had it solved before everyone had even finished unwrapping the rest of the Christmas presents (but only because he has mastered both the 3x3 and 4x4). It has the more durable stickers that don't fall off and lose their color if you use the cube a lot, which is a plus. However, it doesn't turn as well as the 3x3 because it has more parts, so it can't really be used for speed solving. Definitely a good buy if you enjoy the 3x3 and 4x4."
3,Pretty Sweet,"Pretty cool, but I'm only giving it 3 stars because it is SO hard to move. It took me 5 hours to solve and I guarantee most of that time was trying to move it! It also sometimes feels like it is going to fall apart. However, still an awesome product."
2,Fun but very fragile,"I bought this puzzle for my kid after he solved the original cube. I had read the review here and other places stating that one needed to be cautious when turning the puzzle. However, our major problem with it was that the orange stickers (within ten minutes of playing with the cube) began to peel back and fall off. We tried using glue (they had no stick to them) to put them back but it was not long after that the green stickers began curling back and falling off as well.The major problem is that these turned out not to be ""stickers"" after all, but rather colored squares of vinyl adhereing to additional stickers beneath (all white) by means of static. They fall off easily.This is a nice puzzle for show (impressive on the desk) but not for actual continued use. Hopefully, Rubik's can use proper stickers or adhesive in the future and maybe even tighten up the design so that this can be used as a fun puzzle."
5,crazy hard,"i bought this for my lil bro for Christmas. He loves it, he is a master at the 3x3 so i figured this would be a good challenge for him. it is a little rough to twist at first but it loosens up with use."
5,great puzzle like its predecesors,its a great game i also bought the revenge and of course the rubiks classic cube. i like solving it over and over just for the fun of it.
5,fragile,"I bought this 5x5 for my fiance. He was a bit frustrated since he wanted 3x3. Well you will definately find 5x5 more difficult and I guess my fiance didn't like such a challenge. However it's a good challenge and he'll try to solve it after I get a 3x3 one first. :) He found 5x5 very fragile. You just have to get used to it. Otherwise, it's a nice thing to have and entertain your guests. :)"
2,V-Cube 5 is a much better product,"I bought this for my son. Here are his comments about this product:I don't recomend this cube at all even if you aren't speed solving. This cube comes close to breaking almost every single time you solve it. Get a V-Cube 5x5x5 if you want a much better product. What really drives me crazy is that whenever I move the center layer, the top layer moves along with it. Also, the top, bottom, and middle layers don't move very well, although the inner layers move okay. If you use this cube a lot, you are going to want to replace it with the better V-Cube, so you might as well get the V-Cube instead even though it costs more."
3,"Fun, but not very well designed","I enjoy solving the Rubik's 5x5, but this cube is very fragile. I feel like I'm going to break this thing by accident every time I play with it. Kinda makes it useless for speed cubing. The quality of this cube (or the lack thereof) is something you'd expect more from a cheap imitation made in some sweat shop in China that you'd find at the dollar store. You'd think that Rubik's would have the money, resources and the knowledge to build a more durable cube that is easy to move without it almost falling apart on you. Overall, I am rather disappointed in the quality and durability of the Rubik's 5x5. I've heard the V-cube is a way better design, so I might give that a try sometime."
2,Too Much Of A Good Thing,"The original Rubik's 3X3 Cube was a huge hit at my house, so I was really excited to purchase this Rubik's 5X5 Cube, and was even willing to pay a price that was almost triple the cost of the Rubik's 3X3 Cube. What I'd hoped to get, what I'd PLANNED to get, was a fun educational toy which my math-whiz son would love. But what I got instead, unfortunately, was simply too much of a good thing.Beyond the increased difficulty of the Rubik's 5X5 Cube, which of course is a given, the extra squares make the toy harder to manipulate and simply more fragile to work with, especially for adults with large hands or kids without patience or an understanding of delicacy.I will say, though, that the Rubik's 5X5 Cube looks interesting sitting on my son's bedroom shelf. But in my opinion, it would look better, and even more interesting, in my son's HANDS -- the only place this toy's true educational potential will ever be realized."
1,terrible quality,this product is supposed to be a good quality rubiks cube but it is far from that. turning is horrendous and feels like is falling apart everytime i use it.
2,Bad quality,I've wanted a 5x5x5 cube for a long time. My wife didn't want me paying 45 dollars for a rubiks cube but I did anyway and regret it.So now I went with on of the chinese made/name cubes. They're more durable and don't fall apart/hang up.
3,Behind The Rising Sun,The controversial aspect of this film has been tamed by time. The exciting fight scene between Robert Ryan and Mike Mazurki is excellent and one of the best to be seen.
2,Kid's song,"This song is made for a Japanese kid's TV show (something like Sesame Street) by one of the most popular Jpop group Dreams Come True. However because of the audience (3-5 yr old) the music is very cute and simple and it's not really like other great songs of Dreams Come True. Its package is an 8"" cardboard paper sleeve just like an old single vinyl record from 70's. Reminds me of my childhood. It was released due to a lot of requests from thier fans who happened to see the TV show which aired this song without any major announcement. I think it's a collection piece for Dreams Come True fans."
4,A great love story!,"What a remarkable biography of a woman whose devotion to serving the Lord was so clear and focused that she simply trusted Him to help her overcome obstacles that would have daunted most. Her work led her from the rural USA to Egypt, and to this day the work she established there remains (you can visit the web site!)."
2,Buy the jorgensen Brand!,"I bought these 'cause they were CHEAP. I can't say I got what I paid for. I'd say I overpaid.I can't remember now, what I needed them for. They were marginally useful. I tried recently to use them again and had no success. They don't seem to stay aligned.The cauls (or whatever they're called) that lock the movable head interfere with resting the clamp on a table. there are only two whereas most other pipe clamps have three.The female threads are poorly cut and the clamps don't thread onto my pipe clamps more than 3/8"".Save up your money and buy the orange ones."

4,Great information and good layout,"I have found this book to be very useful and well designed. The glossary of herbs is detailed and informative, combining age-old wisdom and newer, medical information. Each herb is also included on a photo page and referenced from the glossary, so you can see what the herb you are studying looks like in real life. The sections on home use, health and body care were interesting and had recipes for a variety of uses. I would have liked a few more pet care recipes, but overall, I'm very happy with this book."
1,Very expensive...when you get nothing,"I purchased this cute little camera for my daughter for Christmas. It is such a piece of junk that even though I purchased a memory card for it, and really, really tried no one could get the thing to work. I have had several cameras of all types and this one shouldn't even be on the market. This was money spent on something that eventually just ended up in the trash!"
2,"Badly written, confusing, and full of errors.",This book is confusing. Knowledge required in earlier chapters is explained in later chapters which makes understanding a topic difficult. It didn't focus enough on certain areas such as monitoring and optimization. There were a lot of errors which led to confusion in understanding a topic. It didn't prepair me enough for the exam. Try a different TCP/IP exam prep. text.
3,"Excellent text, useless CD, high price","This guide is about what I've come to expect from the Microsoft self-paced study guides. The text is easy read, with clear and consise explanation of all topics. It also covers the test material well. The CD, however, only has cute presentations of subjects that are already covered in the book -- it adds nothing to the package. The book is very adequate preparation for the exam and in terms of quality would rate a 9 by itself, but for the relatively steep price you'd expect more supporting materials and assesment exams etc. on the CD."
4,If your planning on PASSING the exam check it out!,"This book is complete in all aspects of what is on the exam. Although it does not go into any great detail, the basic concepts are described and covered very well. There are a few technical typing errors but all in all, with this book a PASS is almost guaranteed!"
2,"Over-Rated, Poor Editorial Control and Value","I'm using this book now to study for my fourth MCSE exam, and find it very poor compared with other books. Here's why. 1. Many editorial mistakes make it hard to rely on. 2. The CD-ROM Multimedia materials do not illustrate the most important concepts, such as subnet masks. Instead, they illustrate fairl;y clear ideas. 3. The descriptions of subnet masks and addressing are far less clear than in other books. Examples are abitrary and not explained. The practices do not focus clearly on the themes of the chapter (try comparing the actual summaries with the actual exercises and you will see what I mean). 4. Answers to exercises are not explained in any detail. For this reason, I found the Microsoft Press material far less useful that materials such as Exam/Cram, on-line articles, and the comments of netizens. I cannot recommend this for anyone serious about self-study."
4,Why did Microsoft include the CD??,"The text was excellent, but including the CD is misleading. I found that the text did a fine job of preparing me for the exam, but I expected more from the CD. Especially for the price I payed. I suggest getting the test exams from Transender.com in addition to this book."
5,All you need to pass the exam.,"I used only this book to study for the exam and passed with a 931. Everything on the exam is covered in this book. The negatives of this book are (1) The first couple of chapters cover material which is not on the test such as the RFC process and details of the protocol, and (2) the answers to most review questions are not explained well enough. But these are small issues compared to the overall quality of the book. The explainations are clear and thorough. Subnetting is even easy to understand. Basically, if you use this book and don't pass there isn't much hope for you."
2,Watered down TCP/IP info,"I found this book good for giving a basic understanding of TCP/IP, but I can't see how anyone could pass the TCP/IP exam using this book... too watered down. This isn't the book to actually LEARN TCP/IP, but it gives a general overview."
3,Strong practices / weak explanations.,"This book would be good for a course with an instructor to explain the why's behind everything. Although there are some good descriptions of terms, and objects, I found it weak in wrapping things together. There was little information on troubleshooting as other reviewers have stated. I am going to try reading the ""MCSE Exam Notes"" for TCP/IP by SYBEX. I have had good experiences with these books."
5,Yamaha P-80 Digital Keyboard,"Great digital keyboard for beginners or teachers. Weighted keys add a realistic feel and provide finger strengthening. Full sized, with 88 keys, from low A to high C. Control Panel allows adjustment of volume, metronome, demos, record & playback, voice/variation, effects and reverb. Keyboard can connected directly to MAC or IBM/PC compatible computers via the MIDI IN/OUT connectors and a MIDI interface..."
5,Very helpful,"This book contains some excellent, practical advice for managing attention deficit disorder in the workplace. The format is nonjudgemental enough (she manages to find positive aspects to otherwise negative traits) that I was able to lend this book to a former manager. Also, her division of ADD into ""Outwardly Expressive,"" ""Inwardly Directed,"" and ""Highly Structured"" worked much better for me than the traditional split over hyperactivity (ADHD vs. ADD). This was an early book after Adult ADD diagnoses first became public, so there may be more recent books out there, but the advice here still works."
2,AVERAGE SHOW WITH SUB PAR AUDIO,"THIS DVD IS JUST AVERAGE, IN MY OPINION, BUT THE AUDIO IS VERY POOR. NOT A FUN WATCH!!!"
4,This book kept my interest; it was very unique.,"I read this book when I was a senior in highschool,which was over three years ago. I needed to find a book for my class, so I chose this one because my name is Niki and I always sign my name NIK. I was really impressed with this book. It was definetly unique and it kept my interest. There are very few books that I really love and this is one of them. I highly reccomend it. It's definetly an original."
5,Fabulous book!,"I just read the last page of Yesterday's Dreams and I can't believe this is the authors first book. I also can't believe that the larger publishers have not found her. The book is a contemporary story of Celtic myth, romance, fantasy and thriller rolled into one. I loved the charectors from heroine to villain and I still can't get over what a terrific book this is. I sincerely hope Ms. Ackley-McPhail will continue to write. This is one of the best books I have read this year!"
3,Better than expected,"I'll review this in English since this is Amazon, but note that the films are not subtitled.Flor Silvestre es a true classic of Mexican Cinema, and Subida Al Cielo is a classic if seldom seen film of Bunuel. So there is not much to say about the films themselves. Any fan of Mexcian Cinema will want these films.The print and transfer quality s always an issue with Mexican films becuase the black market in DVDs makes it impossible for anyone to make a profit reissuing quality DVDs. I was pleasantly surprised by the transfer and print quality with these films. The quality wan't good, but it wasn't bad, and it wasn't distracting. The sound quality was generally ok as well.Finally, the Spanish spoken in both of these films is more or less formal, and clearly spoken, so these are definitely films easily enjoyed by non-native Spanis speakers."
2,Interesting book,I used this book for a class and it had a lot of good information in it. I learned so much about different countries and their business practices.
2,"Looks nice, but falls apart","I bought this barn because I didn't want to spend the money for a wooden one at the time. I must say I am sorry I did. I didn't realize it had cardboard bottom and sides. The cardboard is very thin and the horses really can't stand up on the cardboard floor. Besides that the barn comes apart all the time. The stall dividers don't stay up, doors come off, and the roof gets loose all the time. It is meant to snap together, but you really need to glue it together to get it to stay. I say don't even bother with this. Do it right and get a wooden barn or don't do it at all. I'm sorry to say I really found this to be a piece of junk."
1,Piece of Junk,"I got this stable for my son for Christmas. It was made of cardboard and plastic. The cardboard would not stay in the plastic edges. Aside from my son being upset that he couldnt play with it because it wouldnt stay together, I wasted my money on it. We threw it away within an hour of having it. I am very disappointed, I thought Breyer was a quality name. I never thought they would sell a piece of junk such as this! DO NOT BUY IT!!!"
3,not to bad for older kids,"It is hard to put together. You have to hold everything in place all at the same time for everything to be put together. You might need two people to do this. Once it is put together, the child should carry it from the bottom to move it. Our 9 year old daughter does love it and is careful with it. I would say for 8 years and up."
1,The most ridiculous toy I've ever bought,"My daughter has been collecting Breyer horses, so I thought this barn would be fun for her to play with. It is almost impossible to put together. If you're lucky and do get it assembled, the minute it is touched, it falls apart. She now plays with just the roof on the floor and I'm going to have to throw it out. I was very disappointed because I thought a Breyer barn would mean quality."
4,Horse Lover,I got this barn about 6 months ago and I still have it.Most people are saying that it is a piece of a junk.I think it isn't because older kids who have it will take good care of it and if a little kid has it the barn will ruined because they are to ruff.I would sugest on buying this for a kid ages 8 and up.
3,"For Breyer Classics Size Horses, Durability Issues","I purchased this barn for my animal-crazy young daughter. While the bright plastic roof seemed sturdy enough, I was disappointed to open the box and find out that the side walls are made of cardboard. The floor of the barn is also a cardboard piece. The upright posts are plastic, as are the back opening windows. The side windows do open and close, but they are cardboard.This barn is built for the Breyer Classics model horses. The Breyer Traditional models and Barbie horses are too large for the barn.Within the first 24 hours of owning the barn, I had to put it back together four times. The following day I used a tube of Super Glue to lock everything down so it would stop falling apart.While this barn looks attractive, it is not very durable. If your child is tough on their toys, this barn is not for you."
5,Great book,"I purchased the Christmas book exactly like this one, and I love how simple both ofmthese books are without watering down the importance of the each story. My 2 yo loves the flap pages too. Great book for her to learn from."
3,Make an enemy sandwitch with this puzzle game,"This game fits into whatever genre Tetris does. Please note this is not Yoshi's Cookie, that's a different game.In this game, there are four colums that enemies and half eggs fall from the sky just like Tetris. Here's the catch, you don't control the items, you control Mario at the bottom of the screen. You must rotate around the four columns (switch the columns). To prevent the enemies from piling too high, you can match the enemies and make them disappear (blooper with blooper, boo with boo).The objective is to make an enemy sandwitch between the lower half of an egg and the upper half. It starts out easy enough of course, then grows in difficulty.Its a fun G-rated puzzle game for all ages :-)"
3,Yoshi for Gameboy,this game has ten levels of fun. you can change the music and the speed. i like it a lot.it is sumwut like a tetress game. i luv it.
5,Polymer clay book by Irene Semanchuk Dean,"I've been using polymer clay for around 7 years, and this book thrills me. I know that this Lark series is geared towards beginning and intermediate level clayers, but I think it can be inspirational to anyone, because of the range of techniques and projects. The book has a generous amount of beautiful work by many skilled craftspersons, in addition to Irene's own work. The ""how-to"" projects are worthwhile, but the book stands on its own even if someone isn't interested in these projects."
3,Not bad for beginners,"Arrived on time and does have many projects listed however, if you are an experienced polymer clay handler there are not many things in here for you."
5,"Practical, beautiful and inspiring!","This book is a must for any beginning to intermediate polymer clay crafter or artisan. The projects are beautiful and very ""do-able""! Irene's own projects are displayed in very good photos, and are a marvelous source of inspiration for combining techniques and textures. Her tiled mirrors and wall pieces are breathtaking."
2,Big Disappointment,"Wow, I have to say I was very disappointed with this effort at revising the X-Men. I've been away from comics for a long time but came back after seeing the Ultimate Avengers DVD with my kids. Naturally the first book I picked up was the Ultimates and I've been hooked ever since.Millar's work on the Ultimates was first rate. His work on the X-men was not. In the X-Men Millar completely blows off characterization in favor of action sequences. The problem is that the lack of effort in developing the characters makes the action superficial. Who cares if the Beast gets ""killed""? The inconsistent artwork doesn't help. In the beginning the art was awesome but as the story progressed the art deteriorated.The hardcover format is awesome. The books look great and collecting a year's worth of comics helps hold the attention of an old guy like me. I bought Vol. 2 of the X-Men together with Vol. 1 so I'll give Millar another year's worth of stories to get his act together."
5,fantastic!,"The new story of the brash x-men is fantastic. All of the Ulitmate X-men combined into one, hardback volume is a definite item for the bookshelf. The story and art are pumped full of energy, and you get to see the characters you love in their teen years... definitely not one to miss."
2,Who wrote this junk?,"While the plot is interesting, the dialogue is awful. These 12 issues read like they were written by some 15 year old while he goofed off in algebra class. The art is ok, but nothing special. Great writing can overcome a number of other deficiencies, but terrible writing shines through, no matter how much you dress it up. The writing in Ultimate Spider-Man and Ultimate Fantastic Four puts this junk to shame."
5,AWESOME,"I have collected comics for many years, and I know when I read a good comic. HERE IT IS! Not only is the art amazing but the story gets you hooked. My only complaint is WHERE'S THE ANGEL? and on that note whers Shadowcat, or Gambit, or Banshee, or Havok, or Polaris, ect."
5,An amazing mind shares a glimpse,"Its nearly impossible to summarize Samson Orion's treatise on the true points of human existence in a short paragraph...just as interviews with the man himself offer little more than glances into the genious and deep complexity of a consciousness broader and in a word more ""connected"" than most souls you will encounter in a lifetime on this planet. His MANIFEST is just a doorway, maybe a beckoning entrance into a world few are equipped to transverse...but don't be afraid to take that first step, and see for yourself why Samson Orion's star, his ""constellation,"" shines so brightly in the night sky of human understanding."
4,Towards Book of Disquiet,"Intense like any Pessoa writing it is limited in proportions and content. Maybe the topic could seem outdated, but the metaphors are still valid. Consider it the leading sign towards the surprising and unpaired masterpiece: The Book of Disquiet."
1,Zero Stars,"I frequently had a problem with the installation and software (it would often crash), but I could usually complete a scan. I made a total of less than 50 scans over three months before the Visioneer 8820 started producing a multi-colored grainy background in color scans and a grey grainy background in black and white scans. Customer support was little help. Over an hour on hold on a toll-call, followed by rounds of worthless email exchanges, and finally a 45-minute on-hold and 90 minute troubleshooting call with their technical ""support"" guy. He gave in and let me exchange the scanner for a new one.The new scanner arrived and lasted about 25 scans before it started doing the same thing. Don't waste your money on a Visionneer."
1,Visioneer 8820 scan quality and tech support fiasco,"Just like the other reviewer our 8820 worked fine the first few months then started getting very grey and grainy. We also have Windows ME although no one at Visioneer has yet suggested that may be the problem. Tech support never answers, forcing us to contact the ""pay"" tech support line. They told us once that the PC must have 85% performance or above for it to work, which led me to Dell since our performance was never above 82%. Dell want me to re-install the operating system. Visioneer gave me some stuff to edit in files and registry, which made no difference. We too are ready to buy a different scanner -- I would not recommend ANY Visioneer scanner due to their deplorable tech support."
5,best online purchase I made,"I was hesitant to buy this online, but I am extremely satisfied with my nuwave oven. I only paid half of what it is sold on TV."
1,The vendor is a thief,I bought this product for my 87 year old mother who wasn't interested in having yet another kitchen gadget. I promptly returned the item after Christmas as per Amazon and the vendor's instructions. Here it is in April still without a refund or explanation. I would be remiss to do business with either Amazon or the vendor again.
1,Hunk of junk.,"I give this NO stars, but the site wants at least one star. This thing is a piece of junk. It takes longer to cook completely, and one has to continually 'Pause' to check the doneness of the meat. It looks very done on the outside, begins to over cook, and after cutting the meat to check for doneness, the middle is still uncooked. When the middle is finally cooked, the outside overcooked, the juices run pink on the platter. The tall rack is too tall for cooking a big piece of meat, and it is necessary to cook it down in the pan. This involves turning over that chunk of meat several times to get it cooked. Now, after a few months, the pan has begun to deteriorate, and leaves black muck on the bottom of the meat. The thing is awkward to use, the top is heavy, and the thing is hard to clean. Complete waste of money."
4,Best Oven,Recommend this product to anyone looking to make great meals without spending a lot of time in the kitchen. As with any appliance you discover how it best suites your needs as you cook different dishes using the guide. Once you master the times and cooking levels for your needs it is a wonderful addition to your kitchen. Food comes out moist and tender.
3,Nuwave,"Oven works fine, a little bulky to my preference but it really cooks fast, Easy to operate, clean and maintain."
2,Not as advertised,"I have been disappointed with this oven. I have used it for three months on steak, lamb, chicken, vegetables, salmon, and a roast. It always takes way longer to cook than a regular oven or the direction book says even though I always set it on high. There is only one cooking method not several as the ad implies, and it doesn't brown as well as a regular oven. It does clean easily and might be okay for someone who has to have a portable oven, but it definitely takes much longer to cook than a my regular oven with poorer results. I regret buying it."
2,Nuwave 20201 Analog-Controlled Unit,"I Had a great feeling when I first ordered this product. I wanted to start the New Year off right. Cooking more at home and eating out less. I watched a TV add on this product and decided to buy the Analog version from Amazon to save a few bucks. The first time I tried the product I was very dis-pleased! I followed the directions within the cook book that came with the unit. I tried to cook a small boneless turkey breast. What a mess! I had to keep cooking it longer and longer. Finally it was done inside, but dried out. I now wish I would have bought the digital unit with a thermometer built into it. The TV show made it look so simple. Take my advice, think long and hard before buying this product."
3,Jim Walder,"Does not live up to TV hype. Great for frozen steaks and other items that fit on rack. The instructions are really vague aa to how to cook several items together. Tried several combinations as suggested and wound up with great cooked meat and ruined vegetables. The analog works as advertised and was cheaper. The cooking instructions (besides being hard to read and half in Spanish) are vague as to multiple items. This is not a ""plug 'n play"" item. Must study every item you place in oven to wind up cooked at same time. Wife went back to crock pot & regular oven and I continue to use for last minute craving like frozen steaks and burgers."
2,Slow and easily overcooks,"I have had a completely different experience with this device than others here. I made a steak according to directions for rare..it was very well done. The times in the booklets vary from one section to another for the same item. The card has much longer cooking times than the booklets. It does NOT cook in half the time...the baked potato timing is 50 minutes, exactly like an oven.This is a waste of money and space!"
3,Nuwave,"Love this product, use everyday, clean everyday but have not had for less than a year and container is wearing out already, scratches but it still works just turns ugly in appearance--"
1,CHINESE JUNQUE,"My first air oven was AMERICAN HARVEST. It lasted, with daily use, for well over ten years.That was where i made a major mistake, I bought a ""Nu Wave"" for $140. What a piece of JUNK! I used it five times and it stopped working!I tried to contact the distributor. No response!DON'T BY THIS CHINESE JUNQUE!BUY THE AMERICAN HARVEST! IT WORKS!"
3,Good for certain things,"For a couple frozen chicken breasts and a couple baked potatoes, doesreally good. Is good for 2 people, not for a family. Also did talapiareally well."
4,NuWave Oven,"These convection ovens really work well. Got the analog type (not Computer controls) simply because it is easy to use. It would of been nice if there was an on/off control instead of using the timer for this function, if there was I would of rated this oven a 5."
4,NuWave Oven,"English: Before buying this product we used the George Foreman grill. Our Salmon steaks and chicken breasts always came out dry. We tried these on the NuWave oven and were elated to see that the steaks and chicken came out moist. What a big difference. But best of all you can cook with out added oil. This is really a good buy. As a matter of fact, we purchased one for my husband's mom and she also enjoys using it.Spanish: Antes de comprar este producto usábamos la parrilla George Forman. Tanto el pescado como la pechuga de pollo salían muy secos. Al cocinar esas carnes en el horno NuWave, nos encantó que salieron muy jugosas. Lo que es más, no se necesita usar aceite adicional. Definitivamente, este producto resultó ser una buena compra. De hecho, le compramos uno a la mamá de mi esposo y ella está muy encantada con su nuevo hornito."
5,Hilarious,"This book will have you laughing out loud LOL!!!With each story, the author proves that every circumstance in life, even serious health challenges, can be viewed with a sense of humor. His brand of comedy is energizing and healing. Bought for me, and then my sister, who is fighting cancer. Perhaps instead of ""Laughter is the best medicine"" they'll soon say that ""Ballister is..."""
2,"""God Does Have A Sense of Humor""",I felt it was poorly written and not a cohesive story. I also didn't find much humor in it. It was not at all what I expected nd was surprised it was so highly recommended on the most humorous book list.
3,I thought it would be funnier,"I was looking for some light reading. You know, a book you can pick up for a few minutes at a time. This is it. But be aware that it is basically a journal of a bachelor's not-so-good love life."
1,Mediocre,"It wasn't what I had hoped for. Actually, it seemed like a couple of funny experiences stretched out to make a book."
5,VERY funny,"I loved it. It was so funny-I got looks on the subway from people wondering what I was laughing at. There are reviews about him making fun of his cancer, but I completely disagree. He is making the best of his situation. He had some medical issues and he over came them. Humor seems to be the way that he deals with it and he does it very well. Laughing eases every situation. This book has a lot of stories that everyone can relate to which is what makes it a good, fast read especially if you need a pick-me-up for the day."
5,Much more than a survivor's story,"While the author is a cancer survivor, there is so much more to this collection of humorous essays than just that aspect of his life. In fact, I would encourage anyone who might hestitate to read, not wanting to even touch a ""downer"" topic, to press on and read further. The short selections are hilarious. Incidentally, this was a kindle purchase."
5,Can't wait for the sequel,"After laughing along with Rob Ballister as he tells about his childhood, his bachelor life and dealing with every curve ball and screw ball life throws at him, I can hardly wait for the next installment. The book is well written as a series of essays that stand alone as humorous antidotes on life. As the author states in his forward, ""These stories are not intended to educate or preach... but entertain. Some are almost completely fact, because it can be stranger than fiction. Some are absolutely fabricated. Most are somewhere in between."" His mixture of fact and fiction is right on target and will make anyone laugh."
5,Proud of My Fellow Shipmate/Author,"Rob Ballister shares his one-of-a-kind sense of humor in this wonderful collection of essays. Ballister's honest appraisal and lack of fear when expressing his emotions exemplify the best kind of writing--from the heart. Whether you're a cancer survivor, US Navy Officer, Sailor or USNA grad, you'll appreciate Ballister's candid and revealing examination of life as he's experienced it. This is a MUST READ for anyone seeking inspiration or the desire to make sense of the craziness of their life."
5,Wonderful romantic comedy,"A great period piece. Terrific acting, especially by Frances McDormand. Her facial expressions, however subtle, are the best part. She can act without saying a thing. The story is lovely and sweet, with a wonderful ending. I love how she shows the people around her how to listen to their hearts and do the right thing. One of my favorite scenes is with the cigar; it's priceless!"
5,Amazing,I ask this movie as new and was perfect!about movie I just can said that is funny and romantic! love the end of the story ....show that lifes is good and fair and sooner or later you can get what you wish!whatch it!!!
5,Wonderful. Frothy. Perfect in Every Way.,"This movie is fabulous. Not only is it just a great movie but it does such a good job of recreating the feel of the late 1930's. It actually feels like it was filmed back then. Frances McDormand and Amy Adam were woderful and charming. I've never heard of Frances before this movie but, she's certainly a treasure."
2,"Movie OK, Amazon On Demand Needs Improvement","Movie was fine and I agree with the other reviewers.Unfortunately, the movie continually stuttered and lagged on my 2.2 GHz, Core 2 Duo Macbook Pro connected via a university ethernet connection (about 20,000 kbps downstream, much faster than any cable connection). I tried it in both Firefox and Safari with no other programs running. It did not make a difference. The inability to buffer the movie is a real problem with this service. As I use a Mac, I was not able to download the movie first and then watch it. I will not be using the service again until these issues are fixed."
2,Weak plot!,"Miss Pettigrew is a women who finds her self unemployed and hungry on the streets, comes one day across the chance of becoming the new social secretary of Ms. Lafosse. Ms. Lafosse is in a relationship with three men and is confused which one of them should she dedicate her life to. With the help of Miss Pettigrew, she was able to make the right choice.I thought the plot of the movie was quite weak!The story is probably just too simple."
4,Not everything comes along just when we want it. There are times when decisions just have to be made.,"Miss. Pettigrew lives for a day, is the adorable tale of Guinevere Pettigrew(Frances McDormand) a down on her luck nanny, just fired from a not-so-satisfied client; who finds a friend and patron in Delysia(Amy Adams) an aspiring singer with her hands full of both drama and men.After a well timed makeover(because she couldn't go around looking like Oliver Twists' mother), Delysia hires Miss. Pettigrew as a social secretary in order to help her decide what man, and what life path perhaps, may be the most suitable for a woman in her situation.Both Amy Adams and Frances McDormand are simply delightful, not to mention Lee Pace is adorable as Michael; one of Delysia's three suitors.Not the most creative idea, but a well written and in hand, well acted film.If you enjoy a wonderful romance, beautiful 1930s accoutrements and a charming, happy ending you will love Miss Pettigrew lives for a day."
5,In Which Francis McDermond Sparkles,"Frances McDormond is just delightful as the dowdy, down and out woman she plays - she positively sparkles. Amy Adams plays the ditzy woman to the hilt.....the entire cast is captivating - this is a great little film which is not so little - it is a pretty wonderful story.Johanna Stephens"
2,Mildly entertaining,"Not a bad film, and it contains a good deal of enjoyable performances from all the cast. Yet, in the end, both my wife and I felt there was not quite enough there to make it stand out. Bet you Leonard Maltin gives it 2.5 stars, and I would too, but Amazon doesn't let you give half points!"
2,"Too many lovers, people, and soup kitchens?!","Miss Pettigrew lives for a day was a cute film, but really had no plot. During the whole movie, I was just waiting for it to end, its pretty predictable and scrambled. How does Miss Pettigrew have so much insights into these people's lives? She is just kind of thrown into the commotion to find where she belongs. Its nice that she gets all prettied up and makes friends, but overall after they leave, where does that leave her? A lot of questions go unanswered in the movie. I found it doesnt rent well at work, the few people that have come in asking for it are getting it because there is nothing else to watch. I rented it because I saw the previews and thought it might be a worthwhile movie. I was in the mood for something cute and funny, what I got were very few funny moments and a bit of disappointment."
1,"A slick, empty film","Miss Pettigrew serves up fluff instead of substance. It's romantic plotlines are weak, it's comedy driven by more by lust than humor, the best that can be said for it is that the sets were spectacular.I would not recommend this film to any woman seeking an inoffensive chick-flick. The level of nudity in this film should have earned it an R rating, and it's insincere drivel about the importance of love (without any of the responsibility, authenticity or commitment real love engenders) was offensive instead of sweet. I shudder to think of teenage girls watching this for fun. A very unsatisfying ""romp"" that went straight from my DVD player into the garbage can."
1,boring,"I watched only 40 minutes. I couldn't take it longer.BORING. crazy, I was very disappointed.I give it less than 1 star."
5,Miss Pettigrew,"Loved this at the movies and it was on my daughter's Christmas list. Charming movie, very uplifting and fun."
4,A Great Little Movie,"""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"" is a great little movie. It captures the uncertainty of life brought into focus by an uncertain time--in this case the outbreak of WWII in London. Amy Adams and Frances McDormand are both fantastic, and you'll find yourself wishing there was just a little bit more of this movie when it reaches its end.Miss Pettigrew is a down on her luck nanny who ends up being the ""social secretary"" to Adam's Delysia. A hilarious and action packed day ensues, in which each woman finds her way out of the fog in her life.An excellent film for anyone who enjoys period pieces or Adams/McDormand's work."
2,24-hours is not a good choice,This is the first time I used a 24-hour rental. I got interrupted about a third of the way through the movie and was not able to get back to it within the 24-hour limit. The movie seemed to be good - cannot really evaluate that as I only saw part of it. 24-hours might work just fine for some folks - I personally will not do it again - it was a waste of money.
5,loveeee it,"I love this charming film almost as much as I love Lee Pace. Its funny, romantic, and very enjoyable. There are a few moments that will pull at your heartstrings if you've ever been in love especially if its unrequited."
3,Three and a Half Stars,"I wanted to see this film because I enjoy watching Frances McDormand's performances. I would describe this movie as more of a stage play on the big screen than a typical Hollywood film. As for the story, ordinary yet resourceful Miss Pettigrew lives the life of ""the other half"" for the day as an assistant to a beautiful, exciting young socialite. Miss Pettigrew may be plain, but her down to earth pragmatism comes in handy and is appreciated not only by the young socialite, but by a certain someone."
5,An absolutely adorable video! Great fun to watch,"I discovered this film by accident a few weeks ago. Had never heard of it before. So I thought I'd take a chance and am so glad I did. So adorable. Amy Adams did a wonderful job in this film, as did Frances McDormand. I especially liked the costumes and the music. The storyline was pretty funny, too."
5,From Frivolous to Fantastic,"This movie begins with a flurry of frivolous behavior. However, by the end, it becomes a fairy tale. Will any of us have a day like this? Probably not. But isn't that what movies are for? I enjoyed this movie because it was far from reality--something I want now and then in a good film. It isn't something you are likely to see every day, which makes it exceptional.This movie is for those who enjoy a little romance and sentimentality. I live in the real world every day, so a little fantasy with Miss Pettigrew was a much needed escape."
5,What a delight!,"This movie is just a breath of fresh air! A feel-good, rags-to-riches romantic comedy - the best kind in my opinion! Fantastic cast, fantastic plot, fantastic love story! Great music, great setting, great costumes, great humor! The story is just too sweet! True love can find you at any age and when you least expect it, and this movie is proof that one person can change your whole life for the better in just one day! Highly recommended!"
5,A sheer delight....,"I read this book for myself, then I passed it along to my nephew and he loved it. It is so well written and geared for the younger audience that you will find yourself wishing that you were of the age it was meant for.Paul Amdahl's love for fishing is infectious and it is clear that he is of an easygoing and happy nature because it is so reflected in his writing.I urge anyone with children who possess a desire to fish to have them first read ""The Barefoot Fisherman"" and then when your child is not looking, sneak a peek yourself. You will be glad you did!"
3,Golden Goofers,"This is the 2nd novelty CD in the Popular Time Life Your Hit Parade Series. It is harder to find than the 1st novelty CD which was Fun Time 50's and 60's. this is my opinion, but this Fun Time 50's and 60's had much better songs than Golden Goofers. Anybody else want to comment?"
3,Paxil Motivated,Pebonr moved on to this hard rocking outfit demonstrating that Tom Cruise was right.
4,Great for Detoxing Christians,"Ever wonder how we got from the great commandment (LOVE!) to the great commission (CONVERT!)? I certainly do! Most Christians are mad at non-Christians for not agreeing with them, for not going to church, and for being so damn stubborn.But Jesus wasn't mad at people. He loved people.This book shows us how to get back on the love-your-neighbor track in practical, natural, authentic ways. If you're searching for how to be a new kind of Christian, this book will help you breathe easier."
2,Great form - Stupid Clip,"I was extremely disappointed when I received this pouch. It fits the Razr v3 perfectly, the leather is nice and the look is exactly what I wanted...BUT the stupid belt clip at the back of this case adds a half an inch to the thickness of the case! What is the point of having a pouch perfectly fitted for the RAZR and then giving it a clip which is almost thicker than the phone itself! I simply cannot believe that Motorola designed this product. I will not be using it unless I can find a way to REMOVE the existing clip and replace it with standard belt clip."
4,Love it,"Easy to use and more comfortable than a vertical case. I spite of other reviews, has held up well for 5 months of daily use. Am buying a spare for when they stop making it."
1,This thing sucks! It's broken after 2-month gentle use ;(,"Exactly as what the previous reviewer said, the cheap glue-together flip stopped kissing each other after 2 months. This thing sucks!"
3,DVD Set Not What It Seems,"There is only one reason to purchase this DVD set and that is for the 'B' Horror movie cult classic ""The Indestructible Man"". This as well as the other ""movie?"" on this set ""Man-Fish"" have been in the public domain for years so there have been numerous tattered and horrible quality copies floating about. ""Indestructible Man"" is here for the first time in what they claim to be from a 35mm print but it is still very soft - like it may have been a 16mm print copied early on to 35mm stock (companies did this some times for theaters who didn't have 16mm projectors). Though it is the best this film has looked, it is still not in-your-face crystal clear or crisp so tells me it is not from the ""original"" 35mm negative source. The other titles are actually TV show plays and not feature movies.The packaging is a bit misleading and isn't a ""collection"" of any true sorts showcasing Chaney Jr's work."
4,"NOT a good transfer of ""Indestructible Man""","Contrary to what it says on the package, I'm pretty sure the transfer of ""The Indestructible Man"" isn't from a 35mm film. It looks better than my public domain copy, but the resolution isn't up to DVD snuff, it jiggles in a very VHS-like way, and it has horizontal lines in it here and there that look suspiciously like video dropouts. Also, there's a lot of dirt on it. Just so you know.Even so, it's always great to see Lon Chaney."
4,ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE LON!!!!!,"2 features and 2 TV programs featuring Lon Chaney Jr. The good part is that The Indestructable Man looks pretty good. The Telephone Time episode also is pretty decent with no problems. The bad part is that Manfish was filmed in color and this is a B/W print. The Lock Up episode is good except for some audio problems when they are in the sheriff's office. I can't quite tell if the problem is with the print used or is a problem with the DVD, but I'm inclined to think the problem is with the DVD transfer. All films are in full screen."
3,Havent bought the set but......,MANFISH was shown on British TV in the mid 70s in color!!! Why no color print should exist is a mystery.
1,Customer Service is Horrible,While the product is decent. I received only the ramp portion in the mail not the stand that holds up the ramp. Upon contacting regarding not having received all the parts I was immediately shipped the holder. YET I have been charged TWICE. No one from customer service upon multiple contacts has yet to resolve this.I would never purchase something from them again!
1,never worked,"Still no word back since I shipped the product back with my RMA. But the charger was supposed to plug in & turn a blue light on that remains on until fully charged. The charger that came with it didn't fit in the hole. Also, the interchangeable paper patterns are cute, but the cheap plastic that snaps over it needs a fine finger nail buffer taken to it to smooth the rough cut edges. Very cheaply made."
1,Thinking About This One??? DON'T!!!,"After losing my H500 Motorolo Bluetooth (sniffle) I bought this one. Having had both brands, I can honestly say this is a piece of junk. The sound quality is so garbled that it's difficult and VERY frustrating to carry-on a conversation. The earpiece fits okay, but the Motorola clamped-down more snuggly. I can't seem to get it loud enough either. You'll forget about how cute it is when you're cursing at the lack of quality. I'm online now shopping for a new Motorola Bluetooth. This is certainly not the headset for someone who is expected to conduct business on their phone. Star was for so-so battery life."
3,"Cute, but Complicated","Great product but the instructions are a little backwards. Keep the volume low, there's nothing but static on a high pitch."
1,CUTE BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT,"I got this for a birthday gift it is very stylish. I enjoyed changing the faceplate everyday to match all of my outfits. However, the positives end there. It did fall off of my ear occasionally & the sound quality was garbled at times. Mine was able to hold a charge, sometimes for as long as 36 hours or so. I've had it for 3 months exactly and it just stopped working, won't power on and won't connect to my Razr. I was going to purchase another until I read all of the reviews and it seems like this is a problem with all of them."
2,"Works fine, but not wearable","This bluetooth headset works fine; however, it does not fit comfortable by the ear. It seems to flop around on your ear and is quite annoying. I gave this one away and purchased a Plantronics 220."
2,Just junk,"This was my first bluetooth headset ever and I got it because I wanted to be able to print out a picture so my headset could match my outfit. Now that I've grown up a bit, I've gone thru another 5 or 6 Bluetooths and this was probably the bottom of the line for all of them. It's a great headset if you just want a headset to look cool, but for people like me who actually use them, it's pure junk. Bluetooth is a get what you pay for kind of thing. If you want quality, you're gonna pay money."
4,"Good, but be careful","Good bluetooth headset, but after returning the BT150 and getting this as a replacement, the charging port wore out after about 6 weeks and we had to get another. Only costs 29.99, but it should still last longer than that. My wife fell in love with it when she saw the lady bug graphic insert. It works very well, but BE CAREFUL. She no longer puts it in her purse to make sure that it doesn't hit anything else in there."
1,horrible product,"I bought this one since the overall rating was above 3.5 on amazon. I cannot believe all these positive reviews, I suspect they are from people who want to get rid of these .... cannot hear anything if u are driving a car which is exactly when u need them .. will work if u are sitting in a silent room .... go figure ..."
1,defective product line,I've had 2 of these and both stopped charging after about a month. warranty is expired now and its not worth replacing anyways.
2,Used jabra did not work,"My jabra did not work. purchased march 10,2009. stopped working about a week ago.Did not last a month."
3,"Inexpensive, decent performance with most phones","This headset worked great with an iPhone and iPhone 3g, however it produced echo (heard by the person on the other end) when used with a Samsung Blackjack II.The headset controls are simple and intuitive, and the interchangeable face plate designs are a nice feature for people who need to customize their gadgets."
4,jabra bt160,i got this bluetooth for my wife and she loves it very much . good reception and very light
3,Annoying!,"I wish the carriage parts were attached better. My 4 year old has trouble putting it back together when it comes apart, and the unicorn always comes off of the harness. She finds it hard to play with and I find it irritating to have to put back together every two seconds. The reins are also not quite long enough for Barbie to sit all the way in the seat."
1,frustrating toy,"The unicorn tends to topple as it is only standing on two hoofs and the weight is not balanced plus the coach DOES NOT stay attached to the unicorn at the saddle. After a short while of play, we took all the harness off and just play with the carriage like a buggy. Very disappointing."
1,Too impersonal,"Unfortunately, I read ""102 Minutes"" before reading this book. ""102 Minutes"" brought the reader into the lives of the people who perished in the WTC attacks.In ""Who They Were"", these people were reduced to ""tissue"", ""charred bones"", and ""material"". The author seemed a bit pompous. I could have done without the curriculum vitae of every scientist, engineer and lab worker.The title ""Who They Were"" implies a humanistic approach to a very horrible, yet needed, process of closure. I did not expect the names of the victims to be published out of respect to the families, friends and co-workers. I did, however, expect a more personal approach that would render a feeling of solomn gratitude that some families were given the opportunity to bring home the people they loved."
2,Bad production,"""La Traviata"" is one of the most popular operas ever composed, paralleled, perhaps, only by ""Carmen"" and ""La Bohème"". All opera lovers have already seen several productions of ""La Traviata"", and know, by heart, its lyrics and music. So, when a new production is announced, usually we expect that the producers, as professionals that they are, have, at least, the same degree of experience, knowledge, and good taste that a simple opera lover has. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and the production is not good, aggravated by the main singers bad performances.I would give just one star, but that wouldn't be fair with the orchestra, that is a good one. So, two stars."
2,the world most HORRIBLE B DAMAN,"A b daman with lights and sounds???if you buy this b daman you will get realy strange sounds,its not cool and i would not pay for batteries you should think about it why should you pay for batteries if you can buy a normal dhb b daman and not had to pay batteries every time you fire theres a sound and when you recieve a hit it goes crazy!!!suguestion:only buy this if you are a b daman fan or as last hope and if it gets to much hits it will begin to break.pos:dont buy it."
4,Mayfield Crossing,"Welcome to Mayfield Crossing where Meg and Billie used to go to school. But now they go to Parkview where they are the only African American kids. Meg has problems because of this. She loves baseball and she wanted to play, but the white kids did not let her especially, Clayton because of the color of her skin. What can she do when people judge her by the color of her skin?I liked this book because it had a lot of action like when Meg went to Ivy and told her that her team needed one more person even though she was a white girl. It was Meg's point of view and Meg really describes things that you can visualize. When I read this book I got a real visual about what was happening. When I read this book I was very surprised when Meg and Billie got in a fight with Clayton.I would recommend this book for any age. I think everyone who reads this book would like it and learn a lesson from the story. They would like this book because of the action and conversation."
2,Picture is Very Deceiving,"When this came in I opened it and was immeditaly shocked. This bag is small. The length is decent as well as the width, however the height is only about 5 inches (maybe). I guess I should have taken a closer look at the description and found some measurements. If you are looking to carry only BP cuff, stethoscope, and various other small pieces of equipment this will be fine. I was looking to carry all that plus a small spiral bound notebook and occassionally a book or two. The notebook can't even fit in due to the height."
3,small,did not expect it to soooo small. barely enough room basic equipment. should taken my measuring tape out before purchase.
4,Great,"My wife uses this bag for her Physician assistant courses. She is very pleased. It looks small, but it holds a lot."
2,Smaller than I thought,"I bought this bag to fit my equipment for PA school. I tried diligently to find dimensions on the description but was unable to. Upon reading other reviews it sounded like it might work. However, when I received the bag, it was very small and was definitely a travel size bag, not big enough to fit a diagnostic set, stethescope and blood pressure kit. The bag was a very nice quality, just not what I was looking for."
1,Too small to be useful,There were no dimensions stated. In reality it's 13x4 and only 6.5 inches deep. The photo is very misleading. Definitely returning this.
5,nurse's car-go bag,"I am a hospice nurse, and this bag is great. Sometimes I just don't need to carry the ""big bag"" and this is perfect for my bp cuff, stethoscope, etc. It's lightweight and easy to carry into a home or facility. Sections work just great and my cell phone fits into the side pocket. Love it."
4,it works,"For a cheap 24 inch ruler, it's straight and easy to read - Light weight. it works well for what it is and hard to beat at the price."
4,Just listen to John's voice,"One of the greatest works made by John. Simple, direct, honest.Listening to John's naked voice from outtakes of this disc is delightful. It is impossible not to feel his talent and humanity.Very interesting comments from engineers and from Yoko, but very few 'new material' for die-hard fans.John Lennon was a genious and a wonderful human being."
1,why this dvd too bad?,"no john's song ""look at me"" in documents?and no phil spector in film?hate this way for making money"
5,perfectly shipped and delivered,"I haven't had a chance yet to watch this DVD because i bought it as a Christmas gift for my little brother. But if you live Adventure Time, it is a must have for you. I'm sure it will be great. The packaging and shipping was fine."
5,Super Happy,"Brand new, on time, no damage, and a 30 day back guarantee!!!! I couldn't be any happier, I'd give this company 6 stars if I could!"
3,wish it came up woth warnings that it doesnt work on a UK dvd player.,"I'm very lucky to have a non European DVD player otherwise I wouldn't have been able to watch it.I will do the safest (most expensive, by up to 50%) option and buy it from the UK. After shipping this turned out to be expensive. Even if I wanted to send it back I couldn't the address was a UK address and not the American one."
5,YES,"thsi show is amazing. but if u watch this as an adult, NOT FOR KIDS!! watch it closer and see what i mean"
2,Poor video quaility,What the Lump?!?! The quality of the video is horrible. At first I thought maybe the setting on my PS3 were off. So I tried playing it on my XBox 360 and the video quality was still horrible. The lines drawn around the characters and the character color fills don't match up and the colors seem washed out. I am really baffled by this because the none HD version of the show that comes on TV looks better than the DVD. I have other cartoons on DVD that are much older and have better quality. Wait for the Blue Ray!!I preordered Adventure Time with hope that my daughter and I could watch the first season together from beginning to end.. We have since decided to shelf the DVD and watch the episodes that we have on the DVR.I am highly disappointed that Cartoon Network would release such a poor quality product.
2,This show is lost on me,"I started my experience with Adventure Time after repeated badgering from a friend who is a big fan of the show. Since then, I have attempted watching the series on three other occasions bringing up my total to four attempts. The first two times it was just random episodes, the last two were recommendations, one from my friend and another from the internet. While the art style is very unique and the setting interesting, I really couldn't get behind the most important aspect of any cartoon and that's the characters who really didn't stand out and were bland as well as the stories."
1,Just ONE SEASON?!?,THE REST!! Where's the rest?!? I mean come on! Is Cartoon Network so stupid that they can't release the entire show?!?
1,Why Does Everyone Like This Show?,"I mean,it is overrated,and wierd in my opinon. Weird Characters,Bad Acting Etc. Why Can't Good Shows like Regular Show Or Gumball Get Half the overdose of merchandise this show gets.I mean ,come on! It Has 3+ Dvds So Far With More on the way and gets 500+ Different Action Figures made a year.My Only Problem is that it does not deserve any of this extra merchandise and regular show and gumball should get at least more than shirts and 1 to 2 dvds . Oh Well,Hope You All Enjoy it,becuase it does not suit me well."
5,Lots and lots of fun.,"Adventure Time is a great series and I have no complaints whatsoever about the content of this set - it's definitely worth owning. It's too bad a blu ray version is not available, but the dvds look good nonetheless when upscaled on an HD television."
4,Where the lump is the bluray?,"This and Regular Show are the best things Cartoon Network has released, ever. These shows are B E A U T I F U L in HD, though, and this appears to be DVD only. Animation always looks great in HD. Where's the bluray? I would empty my wallet for Adventure Time in HD, cartoon network. Get to it!"
2,Wonderful show - This version is censored,"The low review for this product is not on Adventure Time. I love the Adventure Time series. I also love that finally we have a collated Season 1, instead of a smattering of various random episodes.However, the episodes featured in this pack are the censored versions. Cartoon Network found some of the humor too dark in the original episodes, and some of the adult themes in the subtext inappropriate, so they changed the writing and in some cases added or deleted scenes that completely ruined the humor of the show.The Tree Trunks episode, for example, is one of my favorite episodes of the show. However, its punchline is absolutely ruined by the addition of a single 2 second scene that offsets the dark humor of the punchline.As much as I like the show I can't in good conscience support this kind of censorship."
5,One Of Frederator Studios's Best Works Since The Fairly OddParents,"""It's Adventure Time! C'mon grab your friends. We'll go to very distant lands. With Jake the Dog and Finn the Human the fun will never end. It's Adventure Time!""Adventure Time (along with The Fairly OddParents) is one of Frederator Studios's most sucessful works. It's about the human Finn and Jake the dog going on adventures. This DVD presents all 26 segments (13 episodes) on 2 discs.The episodes are as follows:Disc 11. Slumber Party Panic / Trouble in Lumpy Space2. Prisoners of Love / Tree Trunks3. The Enchiridion! / The Jiggler4. Ricardio the Heart Guy / Business Time5.

The Duke / Freak City11. Donny / Henchman12. Rainy Day Daydream / What Have You Done?13. His Hero / Gut GrinderLook forward to the second season DVD coming June 4th."
4,"It's Math, man","This show is so stupid hilarious I can't stop watching.I can't wait for the second season to come out on DVD boxed set (and not the stupid random jumble of episodes!)I would recommend the show for anyone over 14, maybe I'm too prudish but I wouldn't let my 13 or under child watch it; it's not particularly violent, the language isn't terrible, there are a few ""sexy"" statements thrown in at random but those aren't so much of why I would object to a younger audience than I would rather my children do something more meaningful with their time. I suppose it is like Family Guy: It's also horrible and hilarious at the same time, it makes me laugh my butt off, but I'm an adult: I won't be influenced by the things I see because I know who I am and what kind person I am.The show really is about nothing, there are no morals or lessons that the characters learn. It's just something to laugh at.I hope that makes sense and that this review helps."
5,Adventure Time!,"Now if only the other seasons would come out! Fantastic surreal show, friendly enough for children with dark twists to make sure they come out right."
5,I want more of these!,"I will totes buy every season of this show they put out on DVD. Srsly, these guys need to quit releasing those silly random episode DVDs, who even buys those?Anyways, the show is super great. I enjoyed the commentary tracks. I hope future releases will have more of those."
5,Instant Classic,"If you had the foresight to pick this DVD up instead of the two compilation packs then you made the right chose. It has everything you could want, episode commentary, special feature worth mentioning and the bombastic episodes of the first season. This is definitely something worth picking up."
5,Adventure Time is Algebraic!,Watching Adventure Time is the only cartoon we watch at our house. We love all the little quirks in the show and think it's just amazing! Glad CN picked it up! :)
4,The Art of Nurturing Oneself,"To me this book is dedicated to women everywhere who want to be inspiredby their creativity,whether it be journal writing, art projects, helpingothers by life coaching or by being in the present and realizing theirself worth. This is about the need to be fully aware of all the creativity we have inside of us and the ability we have to be of serviceto ourself and others. There is a great message to be learned from thisbook. Start organizing your life and become empowered to do good."
5,A treat!,"I must have given this book half a dozen times as a gift to friends or family members who were in need of a little nurturing, or who needed an excuse to spend a little more time on themselves. This book has dozens of ideas for activities to help you through a day, and even a little categorized index to look for a project based on how you're feeling at the moment.A real treasure! Give it to a loved one by itself, or in combination with a nice journal or blank book and a couple of fun pens (I recommend purple), and she will know you care about her. Better yet, buy one for yourself."
5,a valuable self nurturing guide for women.,"This book is a keeper for me and my clients. It's another valuable resource for women. Learning how to better nuture yourself is never a waste of time, and this book is a great tool to help guide you along."
5,"A ""Must Have"" for every woman!","This, the first in a priceless series of books by Jennifer Louden,is truly a ""must have"" for every woman. The book is full of useable suggestions on how to practice the lost art of self-care,all arranged in an easy to use format. It does take some practice learning to take care of yourself, but this book gives you the permission and the resources to do so."
5,awsome baby!!!,"I have played other online community type games before...this one is by far the best...in other games the people were snobish, and clickish, gameplay was tedious and extemely difficult. With EQ gamplay is simple to understand, and while nothing is handed to you, (yes, you do have to work to achieve anything), the process is much easier to acomplish. The people who play EQ are much friendlier too, and willing to help you any way they can, short of actually ""giving"" you what you want."
4,Fun and entertaining,"The Cd I purchased did not work, so I ended up downloading the game digataily. The game is fun and entertaining overall."
3,Depends on your tastes,"I personally like this game a lot. Although there are many people who play that can really get on your nerves, like many people have said before, there are also many nice players that are usually willing to help out new players. Yes, some of the fighting does get repetitive, IF you choose to fight the same things over and over and over. There are many creatures that are available for you to fight all over the EQ continent. You can fight the same things over and over, but that gets boring. I like to explore new zones and fight as many different creatures as I can. If you don't mind taking a while to earn experience and you can ignore some obnoxious players, this game would probably be great for you. That's it hope this helps"
3,"Decent, but not great","Alot of people list the good things, but not everything about it is great. For people on time constraints, it can be very frustrating to play due to the high dependance on finding other people to ""group"" with. I have been playing since right before the first expansion came out, and you get burned out on this game. It may be good at first, but gets old after awhile."
2,It just takes too long...,"The problem with this game is the same one you get with most other games like it. To make it fair for the people who invest a lot of time, they have to make leveling something that takes forever. I played it when it first came out and enjoyed it for about a month. That's a pretty long time for a game i was paying money for after i bought it. If you are looking for this type of game, try Dark Ages of Camelot, it's a better version of Everquest...basically, it has wars with other countries as well...things are handled better. The point is, this game is, nowadays, a waste of money. It was good when it came out...if you have friends to play it with...but now there are much better games out there."
1,No Thanks,"I might get yelled at by fellow gamers, but I hated Everquest.1) The graphics were horrbile compared to Asheron's Call2) I got motion sickness. No other game game me motion sickness. This game started it!3) The learning curve was horrible4) It was tedious5) Couldn't group like Asheron's Call"
5,THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES EVER!!!,"This game is truly good. If you get the expantion, ruins of Kunark, it is even better. WIth everything it has, I am truly surprised it is only ... dollars a month. If you ask me, if it was ... a month, it would still be worth it, even though I would have to give up Food every other week to do that. I mean, with 40,000 players, 1,000-1,500 on every server, you know they aren't doing much wrong."
5,YOu will love this game,"Hands down this is one of the best games out there. It can be very addictive and you will want to buy all the expansions very soon after you purchase this starter package. Don't get frustrated with being new to the game, everyone is at some point. Once you have played for a while and get your character past lvl 5 or so you will really begin to enjoy your adventures. Start a player you don't like? Well try another one!! There are to many choices to pigeon hole yourself. Its a great game play it the way that is fun for you!!! )"
3,"Very addictive, but...","I would not recommend buying this game if you at all have an addictive personality.It's a good game, but very, very time consuming (and, eventually, very repetitious). Because there is no end, you never come to a time when you are finished.I played for 1 year. I knew people (in the game) whose marriages ended because their wives walked out on them because they played so much. Personally, my wife felt quite neglected, and I did not play anywhere near as much as most people I knew. When you get to raiding, raids can go 4 or 6 or more hours, and it is really looked down on to leave before the raid is done. I get much more sleep since I quit EQ.That's all--it really is the most addictive game I have ever played, so unless you really don't mind spending all your free time playing a game (at the expense of real world social interaction, chores, any other activities), be very careful. Seriously."
5,Everquest=brilliance... what more do you need to know?,"This game has everything... great graphics, the finest in RPG, and the realistic gameplay! I don't mean that tiny spell bounding people are real, i am just syaing that the enviroments that you wander around in are just so realistic that you will get very addicted to this game...."
3,i expected more . . .,"as a rabid hockey fan, i pretty much knew what to expect going in, history wise. however, i was disappointed with the lack of interaction the rocket had with his hall of fame brethren- very few even have speaking roles. elmer lach has, i think, three lines. but, the on ice re-creations are spectacular, particularly the climactic scene that spurred the infamous riot, and worth the price alone. ""the rocket"" focuses less on the on ice heroics and locker room life of the man, and instead focuses primarily on franco-anglo tensions of the era in quebec. overall, not bad, but not that great either."
4,More than a hockey star,"Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard had one of the most successful and enduring careers of anyone in the history of the NHL. He began as a factory worker, but eventually got his chance to play professional hockey and he made the most of it. Tough and taciturn, he endured discrimination because he was French-Canadian, and physical attacks from opposing players. He became a hero to hockey fans and fellow French-Canadians during his long and illustrious career with the Montreal Canadiens. I listened to many of his games on the radio when I was growing up, but had no idea of the social and racial hurdles he faced in his life. This is a fascinating and informative movie about one of the greatest players in hockey history."
4,The Rocket,"If you are a true hockey fan, this video is a must see. It tells the story of the Montreal Canadiens Maurice ""The Rocket"" Richard and his struggle to play the game. It is an inside story. If you think you know the story, you are probably mistaken and should watch and learn. Acting is great, cinemaphotography goes between between classic vintage B & W footage and new footage seemlessly. It is spellbinding."
4,RD in another great movie,"I'm not a hockey fan. But this movie has open a door in the history of the sport. Roy D is excellent. The story was one of power and dedication to corruption of organized sports in the 1950's, not just for Canada but the world. It's a must see movie."
2,My Size Swan Lake Barbie,This toy is a real disappointment for the amount of money that it costs. I got this as a birthday gift for my four-year old little girl. This product does not stand very well. She played with it one time and now it's sits in the corner. $30 should be the maximum price for this toy.
1,DO NOT BUY,I BOUGHT THIS BARBIE FOR MY DAUGHTER 3 YEARS BIRTHDAYI WAS COMPLETELY DISAGREE. SHE HAS NOT PLAY WITH IT AT ALLHER CROWN IS IN TWO PIECES. IT IS A POOR QUALITY DOLL. NOTHINGLIKE IT LOOKS IN THE BOX.NOT WORTH THE PRICE THE DOLL SHOULD COST LIKE MAYBE 40.00DO NOT BUY IT WILL BE A WASTE OF MONEY BELIEVE ME WE HAVEONE AND IT IS SITTING IN THE SAME PLACE IT WAS 2 MONTHS AGO
4,Low Maintenance Playdate!!,"Although my 5 year old is usually involved in activities that include other children, she is also extremely imaginative and loves to pretend. Her My Size Barbie was a Christmas gift when she was 3 (from her Aunt) and she is still one of my daughter's favorite toys. Initially I was disappointed with the endurance of the clothes because the shoulder straps snapped immediately. It wasn't an issue for long because Barbie was then frequently clothed from our dress-up closet. I'm ordering her the new My Size Swan Lake Barbie for Christmas so we can expand our low maintenance playdates to 3 members!"
3,Best doll in my collection so far,"As a collector of 32-inch walking dolls, I couldn't resist buying the My Size Barbie of Swan Lake. She is a whopping 38 inches in height and is made prettier and more durable than my walking dolls. The hair is weaved generously, not sparsely like my other dolls. As for the outfit that Barbie of Swan Lake came in, I never keep doll clothes anyway. I bought a cute pair of jeans and a T-shirt for infants 0 to 3 months old and shoes with socks for newborns. All fit Barbie perfectly and look darling as well. The jeans are long shorts or capris on her!"
1,RIPOFF!,"This may look good, and like it's a kid's best friend.no, it's not. it is big and has glitter that will make dust andalso, it's $120! wow, it should be at least $20!what a ripoff. i am soooo glad i didn't put this on my christmaslist!"
1,barbie torture,"I find this toy GREAT, for 1 day, the next, you don't even want to know about it and gets stuffed in your closet. because it so huge it takes up a lot of space and after sitting for quite some time it begins to get really distribing trust me don't get this item begining the owner of one is enough the only good thing it DOES bring back memories"
1,speaking of a lake!,Heres the story. i bought this doll seeing as how i only collect the my size barbie dolls. so i took it on a camping trip. we went to a lake. i sat with my doll in the water and all of a sudden its hair is yanked away by a jet ski and the doll sunk into the lake! two days later a man caught it while fishing and told me that hunk of junk was also a present to his daughter. he said she was dissapointed and next time he fishes he will bring his daughters seeing as mine worked as bate and was a flotaton device for some seaweed! i caught 14 slamon!
3,WAY too expensive!,"Well, my 3 year old got this from Santa. It was the one thing she REALLY wanted after seeing it on TV. So I broke down and bought it. My daughter LOVES this doll, as awkward as it is. She sleeps with it, carries it everywhere, wears the outfit constantly. However, this is in NO WAY worth even close to $...I would say $...at the most. We've had to tape the shoes on, the hair is a mess, the crown is in 2 pieces....same complaints everyone else had. I cringe at the fact that I spent so much on this doll. My only consolation is that she likes it so much. If your little girl wants this, wait until it's on clearance..."
2,"I like to remind you, just a simple remider, you know ?","Before you tell your daughter, ""okay, okay i'll buy it."" Think about all the money you are wasting. Once when she becomes a certain age, she will get sick of it. She might throw it away after a year.The barbie doll cost over a hundred. Now who would throw away 109 maybe 110 dollars so that the child could play with something that will take up space. My friend had one of those. After two years, she threw it away and soon forgot she even had it. There are barbies and barbie houses that cost less than ten dollars. So, before you go out to buy it, think about it."
2,Very Disappointed,"I got this doll for my 3 yr old daughter. She was very excited about it (and so was I). But when I took it out of the box, I was disappointed. Her hair was all crinkled & icky, her dress was pretty cheap, the crown wouldn't stay on, she didn't stand well at all. I do have to say her face is very pretty. My daughter played with her about 5 minutes and that was it. The doll is NOT worth anything close to $100. I do not recommend it."
3,Stadium Checkers not as expected,"As I stated previously, the game is a miniature of the original. Too tiny for four large kids to sit around comfortably and play. The game in the 60's was twice as big and had regular sized marbles. My grand children do enjoy playing it but if any marbles are lost, a package of six (of the SAME color) cost over $5.I wrote to Amazon,Puzzles USA and Winning Moves to tell them and got NO responses to my reviews or critique.....so what's the point of reviewing a purchase."
3,Roller Bowl,"The toy is much smaller than I had pictured in my head. I can hold it in my hand easily. The little balls are lightweight plastic, as is the arena. It works pretty much as I understood though. I think it made it 30 minutes before being put in the closet with Simon, Monopoly, and Sorry."
3,Roller Ball - Stadiam Checkers,This new product is only half or less the size of the one I played with in 1970's but it is still fun. I wish it were the original size but my children love it because they don't realize how much better it would be if it were bigger.
4,Lots of Fun for All Ages,"This is a particularly nice game for younger children who are past the age of putting things in their mouths. We have enjoyed playing it with our 4 and 6 year olds. There's a little strategy to the game with makes it challenging for older children, but it's also just fun to make the ""marbles"" fall, which is fun for younger players. You can even just play solo and enjoy seeing ""marbles"" fall as you spin the rings.It's a bit smaller than I expected and the ""marbles"" are smaller plastic balls, not real marbles. Would be nice if there was better storage for the balls, but that doesn't effect the fun at all. ENJOY!!"
2,Poor Quality CDs for an overall Decent Textbook,"These CDs are used with the Ahlan wa Sahlan Textbook. The book is fine but the CDs are shoddy.The sound quality is poor - room noise, coughing, shuffling of feet - all clearly audible in the background. The track breaks on the CDs correspond to an entire chapter in the textbook. Because each chapter has 4-8 listening exercises, manually advancing to the exercise you want is a pain.The listening exercises on the CDs are not well timed - to follow along in the book, you MUST frequently pause the recording to keep up.Overall the CDs complement the textbook's solid content, but poor structure, sloppy production values and an expensive price tag make them feel like a rip-off. Unfortunately if you're using the textbook, the CDs are also essential."
5,Excellent book,"Great book.After reading the other reviews, I realized that it may not be clear that you need to have the accompanying workbook also (this is the material that introduces you to the alphabet, sounds, etc.). Those two together provide an excellent intro to Arabic."
4,Lots of blood,"This was a bit disturbing. Lots of folks die lots of blood. Richard Gere plays a disturded cop that is bored and ready to retire but wants to make a mark for himself. Being a retired cop this is in some ways realistic and other ways not realistic. It all depends on what a cop does, what his view of crime is and whether he is working for a paycheck or because he believes in the greater good of beincg a a good law enforment officer."
3,Just an 'ordinary' cop movie apart from the Stars,"I wasn't a huge fan of 'Training Day' the other cop film done by this director, but I was hoping for better considering the actors involved. The 3 characters are all lacking in much 'back story' to give us a better understanding of how they got where they are in their careers when the movie opens. The action scenes are well done but its hard to develop much rooting interest for the 3 cops portrayed because each becomes 'corrupted' in his own way so their virtues no longer matter. Richard Gere's character as an example is totally unlikeable, yet he winds up the only one with any sort of 'redemption' at the end but he's still unlikeable. As the credits roll your left with feeling the film is just really kind of depressing and pointless, nothing sets it apart from a zillion other cop movies."
1,Brooklyn's Worst,I was surprised with this cast that the movie was not better. I was very disappointed with the movie and the dark side of the police. I just wanted the movie to end.
4,Where's the Spanish track???,"I'd give it 5 stars, if it weren't for not having a Spanish track on the DVD. Let me get this straight . . . nobody speaks Spanish in Brooklyn, NY? Apart from that, the movie itself is top notch entertainment, with a Sydney Lumet kind of grittiness. I only which folks would stop comparing it to The Wire. A few cast members from The Wire are in it, but that doesn't make it The Wire: The Movie."
1,Too much filth,"Sorry I bought this one! If you want to hear the F word over and over then watch it. I thought it would be good since I like Richard Gere but it was not. This gives the idea that all cops are bad and they are not, at least not in my town. Most are very good. Please keep this filth in the big towns!"
2,Just didn't pull me in,"I usually like cop movies, even when they have a dark edge - likeRighteous Kill. However, this film was trying so hard to be gritty, it just ended up being boring for me. None of these usually talented actors showed any spirit - it was like they were being beaten down by the violent, depressing story amid a dark and gloomy setting. Most of the film is quite literally dark, and muddy looking. There are sporadic scenes of intense violence, but no real emotion. I think I needed someone to identify with, whether villain or hero, but instead I got several characters who all wanted to be put out of their misery. Overall, I found this to be a very slow movie with nowhere to go."
3,Pretty Good,"This movie was worth watching, but I won't be watching it again. It's not a movie I would add to my collection."
1,Don't waste your time with this one.,"I agree with the one-star voters. I wish I hadn't wasted my time watching it. If you like to see people getting shot, this film is for you. Towards the end of the film, there are too many dead bodies to count, almost.Ethan Hawke's acting is good, I think, but all in all, a complete waste of time. Read the other negative reviews - I agree with most of them. Glad I recorded it from TV, so that I could just happily erase it, finally."
3,Brooklyn's Finest,"With a top-billing cast, the acting in this movie is superb, as expected. The intricate plotline that interweaves three separate stories into each other is, sadly, a bit tedious to watch. We popped this movie in with good intentions, and about halfway through (where tension should have been rising), we were bored and checking how much longer we had. That's never a good sign! I generally like cop dramas, so I'm really not sure why this one didn't work out for me, but it fell far flat of my expectations."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"BUY FOR A NEW ORIGINAL BLURAY AND SEND ME ONE OF THE BLOCKBUSTER STORE, EVEN SEALED.Brooklyn's Finest [Blu-ray]"
5,A nicely balance film.,I like how this movie is written. The timing on the three different situations are right on time.I feel this movie is a good police suspense flick. There are a number of well known actors in it. And everyone of them are excellent. I recommend this movie.
2,Great acting...Bad Movie,"Spoiler alert! everyone dies...yep, it's one of those artsy-fartsy movies of deep despair, hopeless situations and in the end everyone dies. The acting is top notch, but the endless drudgery is beyond painful. Life is short, don't waste it on this ""artistic"" self indulgence."
1,A MISERABLE AND DEPRESSING PIECE OF WORK.,This movie has no redeeming or inspiring quality. It is just a two hour marathon of depression. If you want to spoil your evening and experience depression this will do it. All you see is the disgusting side of things. Nothing good.
5,A MUST HAVE,GREAT MOVIE IF YOU ARE A FAN OF TWISTED COP DRAMA YOUR GONNA LOVE THIS.........EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND MORE. OMG
1,Review of Richard Gere's movie Brooklyn's finest.,"I bought the movie because of the cast.Richard Gere had a role unlike most of his roles, and I didn't feel he was good in it.It was way too violent for me. This is the type of movie that we don't need more of in our world.Curb the violence in movies."
3,overly violent,"I was pumped to see this when it came out in the theater due to liking the directors other movies (Training Day and Harsh Times). Those movies were a little rough in areas but this has too much violence. The acting is great but it's a very negative movie. I did like it more when I saw it the second time but it's depressing and maybe too realistic, if that's what they were trying to do."
4,GRITTY BUT COMPELLING,"A gritty setup in Brooklyn that reminded me of THE WIRE. Focus is on three main characters who are cops with conflicting passions, or, in the case of one, passion that has been stifled by numbness. There's quite a cast in this piece including some name actor/actresses in supporting roles (though one could argue Ellen Barkin and Will Patton aren't top entertainers anymore but that's up for debate). My dater didn't care for the gritty violence or the raw underbelly setting of Brooklyn. I really enjoyed it but went in expecting tragic themes. MY GRADE: B plus to A minus (almost a five star but not quite); WHEN WATCHED: 09/27/2010."
4,Great movie,This film is like The Wire + New Jack City + Crash all mixed in one. Great movie. Great actors and a solid plot.
2,Boring and predictable,"This is the kind of movie that was probably not directed towards me. I am a single female graduate student and I like to watch movies from time to time to escape the academic world. A few minutes into the movie I got up to start washing dishes; it did not catch my attention. The movie reminded me of a combination of Training Day and that TV show ""The Shield"". A lot of killing, lots of swearing, bad cops, drugs and money. I have always admired Don Cheadle so I'll watch anything that he's in, but I felt like I had seen this type of movie many times before. I wouldn't even classify it as mindless entertainment because it was a bit too gritty to be entertaining. I bet if I gave this movie to any of my male friends they would love it. There was lots of action and the movie moves along at a fast pace, but it just wasn't for me."
1,"A sad ,boring and depressing movie","This movie had a fabulous cast,but a lousy plot and was quite dark and depressing and I felt the it lacked any merit in the screenplay or plot. A real was wast of time actually!"
3,Disjointed and incoherent.,"This film left me wanting more.3 separate stories ramble on all alone for 2 hours, skillfully acted I might add by Gere, Cheadle, and Hawke. The web of intrigue grows and grows and grows, then finally intersects (somewhat) in a hail of unrelated gunfire, and then..... Well, I wont spoil the ending for you, but after two hours of this thing I really would have preferred a more conclusive ending. This thing just flat doesnt make any sense. All three main characters were outstanding and very believable in their roles, thats what makes this flick such a disappointment. 3 clips, and I'm being kind."
2,"Great Director, Great Actors...What happened?","First off, I hate The Wire. It is profanity laced nothingness with no humanity and watching the exact same plot season after season just didn't appeal to me at all! That being said as I had heard this film compared to The Wire which I did not I just could not get into it. I did find it quite depressing and just not believable.The Director: I think Fuqua is Amazing. I enjoyed Training Day, Tears of the Sun and Shooter. I did not think this film was at all like Training Day...Actors: I like all but Snipes who has done so many low budget cheesy martial arts wannabe flicks I had completely forgotten about him. Richard Gere, his character just depressed me.The plot: I am not going to put spoilers and ruin it for anyone but I just did not feel like it all came together. It was a bit too dark with no light at the end of the tunnel..."
5,Brooklyn's Finest,"This movie is like a Woody Allen film,3 parts in one. The shady NYC scenes remind me of Director Abel Ferrara. The events that take place are like very real. The acting was excellent especially Richard Gere. The New York City scenes are superb. Director Antone Fuqua did a great job. Anyone who likes Directors Abel Ferrara and Woody Allen should not miss this very well made movie."
5,Great cast = great movie!!,"I couldn't wait to see this movie once I saw the commercial for it, and it was definitely worth it!! Without going into too many details, this movie has 4+ different story lines going on at the same time...and they end up being connected in one way or another. This movie has plenty of action & suspense....it keeps you guessing until the end!!! Some of the movie reviewers gave it only two stars, but I have to say I disagree. This movie is definitely worth seeing!!! If you like action & suspense movies, you will not regret seeing this one!"
3,Dark & Depressing,"I would have liked this movie better if at least in the end something positive happened to lighten the dark mood of the entire movie. There was a very tiny bright spot at the end but it just wasn't enough to banish the dreary lives of the main characters.The movie is directed well. The acting is good. The story is good...if it wasn't so sad.I don't think there is a single happy person! Everyone is either being shot, doing the shooting, being depressed, being abused or being the abuser. The drugie or the drug dealer. Everyone just hates their life. I held out on the hope that everyone's suffering would pay off in the end & there would be some joy. It's just one of those NOT ""feel good of the year"" movies.I gave it 3 stars because it could have been much better...the potential was there."
2,A little corny for my taste,"I like girly movies, but this was a little too corny for me. Trust me and save your money. If you want to see it,rent it but don't buy it."
4,A good read.,It is amazing what some people will try to get away with. Some of them do. My only complaint is that the author adjusted the dollar amounts to 1990 dollars. You never know the actual amount that was stolen. Still interesting.
5,The only guide you will ever need to building a darkroom,"I just purchased this book because i am planning to build a darkroom in my basement, and it has provided me with alot of information. And if you have a really small bathroom and you think it's impossible to turn it into a darkroom and use it at the same time, then you better get this book. There are floorplans/layouts & elevation provided, as well as pictures to give you an idea of how your darkroom will turn out. There are so many alternatives given that you can't go wrong in builiding the perfect darkroom of your own and save money as well."
5,For those that still do this...,"This book is a nice and detailed overview of the process, but for me the best part has to have been the darkroom setup ideas for ""alternative"" spaces. If you've got very little room to work with but you're stubbornly attached to the idea of setting up your own darkroom, this book is definitely worth a look."
3,"Ford Total Performance:The Road to World Racing Domination,1962-1970*FORDS NEVER WIN*","I am A HUGE GM Guy/Corvette/Chevy which I believe are Superior,I know Blue Oval fans have it lucky considering they did not Have their Ford Brand Nationalized and that's a good point,As I never would buy a Nationalized product nor SAIC(Red Chinese) owned product(as of this writing a 15& stake) is rumored, And You have to give credit for Henry Ford II taking it to Snobby Annoying Enzo Ferrari(I can't stomach Ferrari)and Beating him with the GT40's, The Complete Domination (Almost) by Ford in the 60's while GM beancounters enforced the AMA ban cannot be overlooked. Although we cannot Forget Chaparral,McLaren and other ""Backdoor"" Racing from GM,especially my favorite being the Cobra Stomping Grand Sports,This book is a good read for Blue Oval guys,Indy,GT40,Cobras,DRAG RACING,and Stock Cars. Wish GM would Have done Something On the Scale of Ford,However the Indy program revealed here was basically on a Shoestring."
1,Try walking in these shoes.,This shoe is a very narrow shoe. My foot has fit in all other types of shoes from different manufacturers. My foot wouldn't fit in this shoe because the shoe is too narrow and the shoe opening is not high enough. I suggest you skip this shoe and buy from another brand.P.S. I currently own an Unlisted Shoe bought from a department store that fits and is comfortable but the leather wore off the top of the shoe within a couple of weeks.
5,Quality shoes,These shoes are even better looking in person. They are very high quality for a very low price!
3,Ok shoes,I like soft cushioned shoes.But these are a bit hard.I like hushpuppies shoes. I tried this company this time. Not great shoes for me
4,Nice Shoe,"My boyfriend has been wearing a pair of high-end Kenneth Cole's for dress shoes for a couple of years. Needless to say a new pair would've made an excellent Christmas gift. Of course these shoes are a great substitute for the high-end Kenneth's, as they are of great quality, but at a reasonable price. He has even already worn them out and he is a very picky consumer. I recommend the Men's Groovy Nights in black to anyone looking for a highly attractive shoe."
2,That all?,"This is an OK video but very short, barely worth the money I guess. I wasn't really expecting much, and that's about what I got. However, the video for ""spit it out"" it great, and some of the concert footage is good too. Make no mistake, the Slipknot CD is terrific - but maybe the fact that I'm a bit older than most of their fans makes it harder for me to sit and listen to their ""interview"" drivel with a straight face. Try not to take yourselves so seriously, Slipknot - I sure don't. While the music is good, there is just too much brainless chatter from the band members themselves."
5,Hell of a band...hell of a video,"This video is a valuable piece in every slipfanz collection...I bought this the day it came out, at an incredibly low price, and have viewed it about 25 times already. They are great in concert, and this video is the next best thing. Excellent bio's for each member, plus live performances of ""the slipknot national athem, and the great and melodic ""wait and bleed""...added to this already impressive lineup of great info..there is also the ""spit it out"" video that is actually a parady of the great Stanley Kubrick version of ""The Shinning"" Order this video now...from one Iowan to another...this video kicks!"
3,Slipknot-welcome to our neighborhood,I love Slipknot more than words can describe. What I dont love is that i paid $... for a 20 minute video.
1,"A lot of ego stroking, no substance","the author spends a lot of my time telling me how good he is as a writer, and then I find many of his recipes do not work properly, or are so vague they could lead to disaster. there are just too many good Dutch Oven cookbooks today to have to put up with this author."
4,It's decent for a cheap point and shoot,"I typically shoot with digital SLRs and wanted a decent point and shoot that was small, cheap, and had decent image quality. This camera is small, cheap, and has... good enough image quality. It's touted as having great low-light capabilities, but the quality at ISO 1600 and ISO 2000 is crap. Other than that, it suffers from the same problems that just about every camera in this class does: very little manual control, no RAW, etc.Don't get me wrong: I really like this camera. I think I just have a chip on my shoulder about the state of the point and shoot market. If you want a point and shoot, this is a very good one. If you pre-focus, the shutter is remarkably responsive. The video quality is pretty good. While ISO 1600 may be noisy, ISO 400 is better than most P&S; cams."
3,"OK pictures, easy use, no memory incl","After much thought, I ordered this camera to upgrade from my old Fuji Finepix 2.0 megapixel camera. I have to say, the pictures don't look to me to be 3x clearer on this 6.3 megapixel model. And I guess I'm getting old because, like cell phones, smaller isn't always better for me! It's a little harder to navigate with the tiny buttons, but I'm sure I'll adjust. If you order this camera, just add in the extra $25-30 memory card right away and consider it part of the purchase. I literally took 6 pictures when it said ""memory full."" But, for the $150, it's a nice little unit and will serve my purposes until technology surpasses me again and I buy another camera!"
2,Kaput after a month and a half,"It was nice while it lasted. I just packed it up and shipped it to Fuji to repair the front lens cover, which either stays half closed with the lens extended or half open with the lens closed, depending on how you look at it. Either way, cannot take pictures with it anymore.After only a month and a half of ownership, I'm not happy about this. Even if Fuji fixes it under warranty at no charge, I have no use of the camera while they do so, and I had to pay to ship it to them insured, with UPS. Adding that cost to the camera alone, I could have bought a more fully featured model from a competing manufacturer.Maybe I'm spoiled, but I've had a ton of digital cameras since the first floppy Sony Mavicas debuted back in the dark ages. This is the FIRST one I've needed to send out for repair."
4,"First, I'll admit I DID purchase this camera elsewhere...","BUT I did want to comment on it as I was extremely happy with it & know that when I am researching something I'm desiring to purchase I like to read a thorough review. When I first researched this & about 100 other cameras, I was looking for something user friendly, both with the camera's features & it's techy connection to my computer. I'll have to say this has been the one new digital anything that I've gotten that I am completely satisfied with. I'd recommend the 1G xd card when you purchase it. The pictures come out crisp & clear & has many wonderful features like the image stabilization & a natural light/flash feature where it'll take the same pic in both lights, safe them, giving you the option to pick which one is better. The low light, night shots are spectacular. It's F30 model is only different if you want to have a manual appiture. Otherwise, for the money THIS is a fantastic deal."
1,Totally Non-Functional,"Refurbished Camera just arrived.Gives a ""focus"" error. Does not work at all.Big disappointment - and no contact information for the store (no phone)last refurbished I buy"
5,New Digital Camera,"This camera was purchased for my wife to replace an older Olympus digital camera. The camera is very compact, has a great 2.5"" display and easy to use controls. The pictures taken too date have been sharp with great colors. In short; my wife loves the camera, especially the ability to take pictures without a flash in low light conditions and the long battery life. She will love it even more when she learns to use more of its many features."
5,Great point and shoot,"I have had this camera for about 6 months now. I did quite a bit of research before buying it, and the points that sold me on it were:- excellent low light performance- very reasonable price- compact size- good battery capacity and no AA's to mess with.This is a great camera, operates quickly so less missed opportunities. Also, I tend to shoot a lot indoors under less then ideal lighting. Focuses quickly and accurately. This camera handles poor light better then most, especially in the same price range. The battery lasts for a long time, even with a lot of flash photography. Colors are natural and lifelike. Built quality and ""touch and feel"" are impeccable. The only drawback is the XD card but it is not that much more expensive than generic cards, so it's really not a big deal. For general purpose ""family"" photography, this camera cannnot be beat."
5,Great!,"I got exactly what I asked for, which was good for its price. I don't know why fuji makes the f20s slightly different from each other, but this one was a lighter grey than my old f20 and looked more elegant. Aside from appearance, it's been working fine so far--also came with a 1GB xd memory card, which I wasn't expecting."
5,Fuji F20,"I'll skip to the chase - this is the best low light point and shoot camera you can buy. At any price - including 2008 model cameras. I hardly use the flash - even indoors and even at night. Just hold the camera steady and go. Natural lighting in photo's always looks better than stark bluish flash. If I do use the flash its just for fill.The video feature is a nice touch - DVD quality in sharpness, but I use it sparingly as its mostly a novelty even though it makes buying a full fledged camcorder irrelevant.The only downside to the camera is the xD card which has slowish PC transfers, compared to SD anyway, although writing to the card itself when taking pictures is plenty fast. I use a 1gb card and its tricky to fill with images, but video eats up room fast.Still, if the purpose of this camera is quick shots in anything other than bright light, you simply can't buy a better one - yet."
4,Great low-light performance,"I bought this camera as I was looking for a FujiFilm F30 or F31 - looking for a solid performing low-light compact camera. Noise is minimal even at ISO400 and pics are usable at ISO800, which coupled with the very short focal length of compact digital cameras makes for very good available ligh shooting. This is what I expected after reading the F30 dpreview where it performed comparable to a Nikon DSLR at high ISO values (800, 1600) - as the F20 shares the sensor of the 30 and 31.Manual control is minimal, there is no image stabilization (just a 'anti-blur button' or something - which is really a joke, it just throws the camera into a high speed automated mode with ISO2000, flash etc) but as we all know good high ISO performance is far more useful than stabilization.A nice little camera, with amazing low-light performance for a compact."
5,F20 great little camera. Get it while they last!,Recommended. Nice sharp outdoor pics. Indoor at hi ISO much less noisy than my other p&s cameras.
5,Sweet Camera,"I didn't want to drop big bucks on a camera, so I decided to get a lower-end, inexpensive Fuji (a recommendation from the local gadget guy). I got a steal ($85) on this one as the camera shop was clearing them out for the '08 models, so I couldn't complain about the price. As for the quality, it is second to none for an inexpensive camera. I even tried taking a picture of my wife in pitch black and got a gorgeous shot! It has a ton of picture modes and bells and whistles, but the menu is easy to navigate. It also comes with an AC power cord that you can use if you want to save battery life (which doesn't seem to be a problem since it uses a rechargeable lithium-ion battery). The only downside is that Fujis use XD memory cards which generally tend to be a little more expensive, but I wouldn't let that sway me from buying this great camera. When my children get a little older I'm definately going with Fuji's for them also."
4,Good Camera For the Price,"Pretty nice camera. Pretty cheap now-a-days, and it has the capabilities of creating some fantastic images. It'll take a little while to get used to playing with all of the features and settings, as AUTO mode sucks, but once you get it, the camera produces gorgeous photos. Very slow photo taking, and speckling at high ISOs though."
1,Don't buy,I would suggest against buying this camera yes the price is great and it does work great but I had this camera for less than a year and the camera screen went black so I can't see what I am taking a picture of anymore. The camera also doesn't have a viewfinder so I can't take pictures that way either. This has been a problem for other users as well. Besides that if you want to take a chance of that not happening it takes very good pictures and it has an excellent shutter speed.
4,Great point and shoot camera,"This is the second one I bought. I gave away my first one to a relative. After researching for a new one, one year after the first purchase, I still went for the F20. The new cameras, including Fujis, went to the direction of higher Megapixels, which only improves performance in perfect outdoor lighting. For overall outdoor and indoor performance, this is the best compromise. I only wish it have real image stabilization."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I bought this air system and it didn't fit. It even came with parts that were too short. I called the manufacturer and was told it wasn't made to fit exact and that it would be OK to leak air from not fitting. You can envision the rest of the conservation.
1,Very poor quality book,"On the back page it is written: ""...a major revision of the successful book..."" ? I wasted my money on buying this book. If you want to be serious in programming in Mathematica, get or buy a copy of the author called Maeder."
4,A pleasant diversion,"Oxford Mourning is the perfect companion for a cold, winter afternoon, when your body is weary from a morning of sledding with the kids, and your mind, while alert, is not quite up to the task of too challenging a read. Partway through this short, tight mystery, I realized that Stallwood's attention to her characters was somewhat reminiscent of Barbara Vine/Ruth Rendell's marvelous psychological studies masquerading as whodunnits. I say somewhat because Vine/Rendell is a master of the genre, whereas Stallwood is more of a reasonably apt pupil. Two Kate Ivory mysteries preceded this one, but I have not yet read them. That said, let me note that, in Oxford Mourning, the secondary characters of ""the family"" are more vividly portrayed than the sleuth herself. Not at all a disappointing way to spend a few hours, though."
2,Flitting through Oxford,"I picked up this mystery because I enjoy English settings. Oxford is an important character in this diverting novel. It is a quick read, and often entertaining. On the whole, however, I was disappointed in it. One of the main characters has lost her memory, and consequently is presented very vaguely; it is hard to care about a character so illy defined. I think the novel would have been stronger if we had a sense of Angel's character earlier. Stallwood shifts the narrative voice from character to character almost paragraph by paragraph, I had a sense I was developing ADD. A light, diverting read, but Stallwood cannot develop characterization as well as Margaret Yorke."
1,Good paper weight!,"I have an SM200C... I wanted it so that I could travel and listen to MP3's, in the car on the plane etc.. Without testing it out first, I went on a vacation and nearly jumped out of the car when it skipped MP3 CD's like a schoolgirl skipps rope!It skipps, it's readout does not have a light so that you can see it in the dark, the readout reads from very little angles, and the sinleg button interface work poorly when looking at the road and trying to change songs. I found myself hitting stop and pause alot!Also if you plan on listening to something longer than 10 minutes, don't! It plays the first 5 minutes, and then skipps past!LOOKING FOR A GOOD MP3 CD PLAYER>>> Look elsewhere!"
5,Fine Table,"I bought this table, not for camping or dutch oven cooking though I do both, but for a BBQ table on my deck. I put my Smokey Joe on it and don't need to bend over to cook or worry about hot coals or messy ash. I keep my charcoal caddy and chimney starter under the table and keep it all covered when not in use with a cheap small grill cover though it doesn't seem to mind the rain.Amazon had this product cheaper than anywhere else and order/delivery was flawless as usual."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this toy after buying it for my 3-year old daughter for Christmas. The attachment that rocks the cradle is already broken (it never worked great to begin with). The knob to turn the cradle rocker also doesn't work properly. There are many tiny accessories that are easy to lose. The accessories that are supposed to fit on the cradle, like the mobile, don't stay in. The dolls are okay, but the rest of the toy seems cheaply made. Not worth the $20 I paid for it."
5,WOW!,"If you've never heard Karen Savoca, start listening now! This is one powerful set of chords. Turn up the volume and get ready. If you have a chance to see her live don't miss it."
3,the mellower side,"While I prefer the harder edge of The Gathering this is still a fine release but quite a bit mellow as the title suggests, can make you ' sleepy'"
3,I'm hooked - you will be too,"Great series, but the DVDs, unfortunately, are missing several episodes. Search for Starhunter on the Internet to locate the missing ones. Otherwise a good buy."
2,Starhunter,I ordered this thinking that it would be a 'cleaned up' version of the original. What it is -- 2/3 of the original collection in 2 vols. Not my favorite way of getting a series. Same quality of copy... so those flaws that other have written about are still present in this set. If you want the whole series look for the 4-disc set and you will be much better pleased.
3,"Cool Book,but too critical","A great thing about this book is how it lets you know about lesser known movies (Gappa,Attack of the mushroom people,The X from Outer Space,War of the Gargantuas,The Magic Serpant, etc.).However,it is too critical of some movies(how coul he not like Godzilla vs. Destroyer is beyond me).Still,a good book."
4,Monsters Are Attacking Tokyo!,"A remarkable book that contains Toho, Daiei and other studio's film on Japanese's unforgettable monsters of the past.Godzilla, Gamera, Majin, Gargantuas, Mothra, Ghidorah etc. are some of the greatest monsters featured and also crew members that talk behind the scenes. I also like the rating of the films."
3,"great interviews and facts, but too ""fan boy"" in its reviews","like the authors first book,this is a treasure trove of facts, and in addition, some remarkable interviews with the talented people who made these sometimes wonderful,sometimes awful, but always fun movies. I have to agree with others who feel that the reviews are sometimes way off base.Some films are wildly overpraised while others (almost always the more recent Godzilla films) are Dammed. Like too many godzilla fans,the author needs to get over his ""the old films are better""nonsense. Its like those sad people dressed up in star trek uniforms arguing over how GREAT William Shatner is and how awful Star Trek is without him. Sad to say this is something beyond many fans. after all, the word fan does derive from fanatic! however... enjoy the books interviews and photos. as for the reviews, don't take them with a grain of salt...take them with the whole salt mine!"
2,Disappointing,For the most point this is a very poorly put together book. The author took the time to interview many key people from Japanese sci-fi/fantasy cinema and then pieced the interviews together in a extremely disjointed form. Working the interviews into a narrative would have been much more interesting.
5,Where Do We Find Such Men?,"Winston Churchill said, ""A nation that does not remember its heroes, will soon have no heroes to remember."" This well-written and fast reading book pays tribute to one such hero. In a place and time where heroes were many, this man, this Marine's Marine, rises to the top. I would like to have met Jimmie Dyess. Thank you, General Smith, for introducing him to us."
5,Fantastic Book,"This book is fantastic! It opens a panoramic view over the future, the new era of biology. I thoroughly enjoyed reading and studing it. It is full of interesting ideas, insights, and techniques. It should prove very valuable to both biologists and computer scientists. Very clear and rigorous foundations. Mr. Baldi and Mr. Brunak are also funny. Nice entertaining pictures."
1,Terrible,"I'm a graduate student, reading a lot of bioinformatics materials. This is by far the worst text I've read on the subject. Poorly explained, poorly edited. Poor."
1,the worst book I have ever read,"Just a collection of formulae, in an unclear way. Once we tried to use it in our seminar of bioinformatics, but after a few chapters we had to give it up for its bad writing. I could not find any reason to buy it or read it."
2,Not a good book for learning new material!,"This is definitely not a good book for learning the material for the first (or even second!) time. It's difficult to read, has too few examples, and the material is way too condensed for studying analysis. Based on what the author presents, the problems are generally difficult to solve."
2,Yakkkkkkkkkkkk............,"This is a text book for math major students. I believe nothing is more terrible than a book full of theorems without adequat samples. And this happen to be one. The ""A Probability Path"" is much better than this one."
5,A change of Pace,"Oh man! I saw the movie and loved that song that went along with the ""Potato Scene."" When I heard that song, I was hooked! I kept going back to the potato scene just for that song, that is when I figured I should get the soundtrack before I burn a hole in the DVD. I just love the cd, it is a change of pace for me. I'm into all kinds of music, but this was something I've never heard before, and I loved it! It's still, to this day in my cd player at home. It is a nice cd to kick back to, or in my case to clean the house, or do some baking. I recommend this cd to anyone who has a unique taste in music. It is awsome, I could go on and on. But I won't. Buy it!"
5,Unique,"Other reviewers know these musicians. I do not. I simply saw the movie and flipped for the soundtrack (and the film as well). Eastern European, yes. Rock, yes. Traditional, yes. Sardonic, yes. For everybody, no. For me, mezmerizing."
5,Very illuminating!!,I bought this cd for my 31 yo daughter after we watched the movie and loved the music. She plays it often and we were both thrilled to find that every song is great. That doesn't happen often with cds. I would recommend it to anyone who loves all types of music. Thank you.
4,cd movie sountrack,CD arrived promptly and well packaged and was given as a gift a few weeks later. Quality fine but I was disappointed to find lyrics were not included.
5,Wonderful,"At least 4 songs are just phenomenal on this CD. Hautingly beautiful songs that transport you to scenes from the movie, or allow you to reflect upon scenes from your own life. I've played it over and over on the Ipod, and often come back to it; quite rare for me. Some of the other songs I could hardly listen to even once, but this seems to be par for the course when you buy a CD."
3,Damn Fine Indie Pop,"Most of you would remember Turnstyle's 'Country' album from a few years back, even if only for the Purple Crown, Spray Water On The Stereo and Portamento singles. If you liked this, rest assured, the bands follow-up album, 'Corporation', is a step in the right direction. Turnstyle on 'Corporation' have managed to pull off the difficult task of musically progressing without any chance of alienating their earlier audiences. Examples of the finer songs on this album include the cute electropop of 'Take My Hand', the quirky casio inspired 'TWP"", and one of the catchiest and best titled songs of 2001, 'World Famous In Perth'. Great indie pop that you really should purchase."
4,A new kind of classic,"I loved this book, and although it was difficult to read, I think that that was where a lot of the value in it came from. If any of you have a history of sympathizing with the underdog, read this book. And the ending, although startling, is by no means disgusting -- in fact, anything less would have done an injustice to the theme of Steinbeck's story."
1,"I hate John Steinbeck, AND I'm smart!","Of Mice and Men Is one of the worst books I have ever read. Let me count the ways:1) It has immeasuably two dimensional chacters. Steinbeck stays so close to the archetypal ""strong man"" ""seedy guy"" ""angry little guy"" ""seductive wife"" its disgusting. he even has a token black guy! Absurd.2) An equally two-dimensional plot. Steinbeck's unbearable heavy handedness in getting his all important ""moral"" across completely crushes out any vestige of meaningful charcterization or subtext.3) The ending. No, I'm not about to say ""ew!"" What i will say is that thats what he WANTS you to think. He wants you to put down this book and ""realzie the impossibility the america dream, and the cutthroat nature of humans in general."" The problem with this conclusion is the entire book is completely contrived! The most absurd confluence of cicumstances that could possible occur come togethr in this book."
3,TNG--they forgot the premise of the ensemble cast,"I love Star Trek, but I forgot how lame most of these movies are. The TV episodes worked well with a main outer threat and an inner personal conflict subplot. Unfortunately, a movie needs a bit more than that level of complexity, if only because it's twice as long. It was part of the Star Trek Bible that there were no conflicts between crew members, but a movie should give more depth to each character. These movies are plot driven and less than original in most cases.They are what they are. I still like the characters, but I would not have bought the movies if I had remembered them. I should have bought a box set of episodes. Ah well. The packaging is nice, and if you are a true trekker, you need the good, the bad and the mediocre in your collection."
2,ALmost worth it,"We could not wait to get theses in. Cleared up a Saturday afternoon and started a Trek marathon But when we got to Insurrection , I had to max the volume on my Bose system , turn off the air, shut the front door and listen very hard to hear any spoken word. I did learn how to quickly mute the audio when any action was taking place. Okay I sort of already knew how to do that, I just got better at it."
2,Missing DVD,"I ordered this collection for Xmas of 2009. Until recently we had not viewed it. When we decided to watch the 'Insurrection"" DVD, to my surprise, no DVD in the package. While the DVDs are enjoyable Ifeel I was ripped off.Star Trek: The Next Generation Motion Picture Collection (First Contact / Generations / Insurrection / Nemesis)"
3,Generations disc defective,"The picture and sound are great in this set except for the Generations movie. This disc was defective. The contrast and color are bad. I emailed Paramount, asking about an exchange a couple of weeks ago, but got no reply. I have no way of knowing whether all the Generations discs have this problem, but I was not pleased with mine (although the other movies are great) and I am even less pleased with the lack of response from Paramount."
4,Not a perfect set but good enough.,"Not a Trek Fan but love Sci-Fi so this was a no brainier as I had fond memories of the TNG Series as a child. Although I find the films silly and unintelligible, this is a fun set nonetheless. The video quality is inconsistent with most all these films. I had the Original Series Movie set before this and my Jaw dropped at the likes of Wrath of Khan. Do not expect that kind of quality or even story telling for that matter."
5,OOOHHHH SSOOO HAPPY!!!!!,"If Amazon had lips I would kiss them! I have this collection already but not on Blu-ray!!This is going to make my Thursday night Trek-Meet so much better. My buddies and I all gather in my parents basement and review each movie. It's a potluck so we have klingon burgers, Vulcan nerve pinchers (fried jalapenos), Captain Kirk Fries (just regular fries), etc. etc.I think the best part about it is that my screen is 72 inches and we can stand next to it pretending that we are actually IN the movie.My meetings are going to rock so hard because of this! As sure as the shields fail during battle, I am going to be a LEGEND!!!!-James Nimoy Yamamoto-"
3,Good deal if you don't already own them.,"Theatrical version only. No director's cuts available in this box set. HD quality good, but nothing spectacular about the conversion. Lots of extras for each movie, including deleted scenes and an alternate ending for Insurrection. Worth buying if you don't already own these on DVD or are just collecting for the sake of completeness."
4,Star Trek: the Next Generation Motion Picture Collection,Nicely boxed set. Purchased this set for my husband for Father's Day. Very good value for the money in Blue Ray. Have already watched 3 of the 5 disc's.
4,Strictly For TNG Fans !,"Based on what I've seen for the first 20 minutes of Star Trek TNG disc 1, I must say that the picture and sound is a great improvement as compared to DVD. The fourth disc contains supplement. I do enjoyed the portion of many ENTERPRISE that was presented throughout the years ! A real good buy for TNG fans."
5,Just what was expected!!,"Exactly what I thought they would be... high definition copies of the original films. If you like Star Trek especially Next Generation, then this is the best set I seen."
3,seems ok,"The order arrived quicker than i expected,but,i saw very little difference between the DVD and the BLUE RAY. I think the older the movie the more dramatic effect you will see in video quality. I also purchased an older movie called ""Patton"" on blue ray and was very impressed with the quality of the video."
5,Excellent compilation,"Okay, Insurrection and Nemesis were underwhelming. Non-great. Bad, even.This BD collection presents the whole shootin' match in absolutely spectacular video and audio. The extras are superb, even those made before the era when such a thing was expected.If you only like Generations and First Contact, the price may be steep. If you want completeness of the whole movie cycle, this collection is for you."
5,Star trek DVD review,Well what can I say. It's Star Trek and rocks. I'm very happy with the purchase. I had already seen all of the movie's so I had an idea of what I was getting.
5,This is a great movie for anyone who is a Star Trek fan! Live Long and Prosper!,"The reason why I bought this Star Trek collection was because I learn that these DVDS has the subtitles and the audio in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. You can enjoy the Star Trek movies and learn these languages, too!"
4,"Great item, a few flaws though.","This collection pack is great for any enthusiast who is obsessed with Star Trek: The Next Generation and wants a Hi-Def remastered set. However, when you deal with remastered editions, you sometimes run into movies who have had their works of art remastered by lazy companies that cut corners. As some of the other reviews have mentioned, the corners and shadows do have some flaws. The largest flaws I mainly saw, which literally annoyed me, was the remastered work on the CGI shots. Some of the CGI shots, compared to the non-remastered editions, seem like they were drawn by a Japanese cartoon artist for the local newspaper. Other than that, the general shots of the characters and the motions between the characters is great. If you are not too concerned with the issue of the CGI, I encourage you to purchase this item."
5,Awesome!,Great! Love it! Enjoy these movies sooo much! I am such a huge fan of the Star Trek Universe! It's a really nice package!
4,Fantastic... but not perfect....,"This is something I've been waiting for since blu-ray was first announced. And while the main feature was exactly as I always envisioned(Sleek and visually stunning). Some of the extra features lacked the real depth that you would come to expect from a collectors edition boxset in blu-ray.The round-table discussions were mediocre at best. Apart from the host, I dont believe any of the panel even remotely feigned wanting to be there and their analysis left a lot to be desired; at times even misguided or misinformed. The Starfleet Academy extra feature was redundant at best, only explaining in no extra detail exactly what you just observed in the main feature; although noteworthy because its presented by a most attractive cadet :)Apart from that though the commentaries were highly entertaining as well as the homage to Data. All in all brilliant value for money and highly recommended addition to any sci-fi fans collection. Buy now!"
5,Great value,It is a great collection. I have had the chance to look at First Contact and Nemesis and the clarity of the picture and the sound on my Denon/Aperion system is amazing.I would clearly reccomend it for any Trek or sci-fi fan.
4,"Movies are Top, Disc 5 almost a Flop","The Movies are okay there is not much to say, but the 5th disc is almost a joke!!!!!!The special features is catastrophic on this disc.the different ships and the villains feature are very short but okay. But the rest on it is a BIG CRAP. The Las Vegas Show has really nothing to do with this movie set and this crap runs almost 40 min, what a waste of time its just a big commercial show,with lowgrade actors from something thats not existing anymore."
3,As close as we will ever get to true TNG HD quality?,"After it has become possible to enjoy Kirk and Spock in high definition, Picard and his crew are finally next - but unlike Kirk and Spock, Picard and crew will be limited for a long (if not life-) time, to the 4 TNG movies.Because of the amount of remastering work necessary, current plans to release ST-TNG (the TV series) on Blu-ray feature the old, poor video transfers dating back to the late 80's. In simpler language: less discs but light years away from true HD quality.So, for what it is worth, the TNG movie collection may be literally the only way to watch adventures of Picard, Data, Riker, Troi and all the others in true, high definition picture quality - unless we all tell Viacom that we also want to see the TV series in HD, that we still care and cherish the TV series.A rather small step for Viacom, but a giant leap to preserve one of the most iconic Science Fiction TV series and generate interest in 'our' next generation..."
4,Great Gift for a Fan,"These were a gift for my son, but I watched them all with him. The Blu-ray looks fantastic on a large HD screen, and the sound is excellent. I wish Nemesis and Insurrection were better movies, but Generations and First Contact alone are worth the purchase."
4,Great Blu-rays Damaged Box-set,"The Next Generation Blu-ray films are wonderful. Great picture and great sound. The Amazon packaging was excellent. Unfortunately, the box-set inside was damaged, which means they placed a pre-damaged item inside the Amazon box. Several of the blu-ray cases were damaged and cracked as well. My blu-ray box-set was sold by Esolution Tech LLC through Amazon."
5,Must have for the serious Trekkie,"Personally, I am not a big fan of The Original Series, but as a die hard Trekkie, these are a must have."
5,Fantastic Blue Ray Star Trek,"For any fan of Star Trek, the blue-ray DVD version of some of the franchise's greatest movies should be a non-brainer. Great resolution and worth every penny. Highly recommended."
3,Need Stronger Glue,"This product works well, but the glue comes unstuck when the laptop has been in use for any period of time. Also, I think they would work better with 2 pairs affixed to the laptop. I put the set I purchased on the rear of my laptop and while the majority of the laptop feels nice and cool the front few inches are still warm - with an extra set more air could circulate.The feet are a simple solution to the overheating problem, but the slipping and sliding created by the provided adhesive is an annoyance, to say the least. I have peeled off the original adhesive and am trying double-stick tape. Overall, this is a worthwhile product."
3,Didn't work for me,"My 14 inch Dell runs very hot. As a result, I tried giving it a little more air flow via these legs. They worked for a while, but then the adhesive stopped sticking and they would come off. At the price I paid, I was hoping for a long lasting solution, but no such luck for me. Ultimately, if you have a very light laptop or your machine doesn't run too hot, this may work well for you. Otherwise, you might face some disappointment."
5,Works Great for Keyboards Too!,"I have a older wireless keybloard with a lot of extra bells and whistles, including a couple little fold out feet in the back two corners that would tilt the keyboard to a more comfortable angle for use. One of my kids dropped the keyboard while using it on their lap recently, and broke one of the feet. After looking and looking to find a replacement for the broken ""foot"" everywhere, and unable to locate any, I finally decided to try the Laptop Legs. I just folded up the one foot I had left, and stuck the new laptop legs to the bottom of the keyboard in the back two corners, and it works great. Very stable, and very sturdy. It's great to have the keyborad back to the way it was before."
5,Pricey for what it is.. but genius,Not so much genius.. as oh why didn't I think of that!? Such a simple and perfect minimalist solution. Before this I had an Aviiq laptop stand.. and in hindsight is just way too over-engineered and is one more thing you have to lug around. These just flip open and improve air flow as well!
5,"have bought these before,love item","i have used a pair of these for years on several laptops. After removing them alot of times to use on new laptops, i figured i would get a new set (and got two).Love item, really works."
3,Can't Talk to Princess,"Our daughter got this phone as a gift and was really excited to open it. She wanted to speak with the princesses. Unfortunately, when you dial the princess' numbers you only reach one of the ""favorite"" songs. The songs do not even correspond to the movies or CDs. It does have some fun learning activities where you find the princess' partners or play some musical tones, but all in all we thought it was disappointing. Additionally, some of the tasks were a little beyond our 4 y.o. capabilities, requiring her to read the ""phone book"" to dial the correct number."
5,My girls love it!,"My oldest daughter who is about to turn 8 has had this phone for a few years now and it is still in great shape. This is a compliment to the toys durability as she was not always the most gentle with her toys! Now I have another daughter who is going to be 2. She also LOVES to play with it, so I am getting it for her as a Christmas gift, seeing as my older child still wants to use it aswell. Now-the educational aspects may be too advanced for her at this time but she does love playing with it and it can grow with her. I have no worries of it lasting."
4,"Cute, but can't talk to princesses","My 3-year old daughter loves this toy, but she keeps trying to dial the princesses to talk to them. She can't. Dialing their number only plays music, which confuses her. But overall, a nice, colorful toy."
3,It's okay,"The product does not leak at all, but I have had a terrible time keeping it from crumpling up and keeping my daughter on it. She moves so much that most of her accidents have still ended up on her bed. It does not do well staying flat or underneath her because she moves during the night."
2,"Too chatty, too cute, too lean","Busch's book was too chatty by far to suit my tastes and expectations. For example, I would have taken my editor's red pen to filler like this: ""There were lots of photographs of the Hindenberg as it started its descent in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, and quite a few of the charred rubble on the ground afterwards, but none of them made the cover of a Led Zeppelin album."" If you like this kind of commentary in a book on photographic techniques, then Busch's book will delight you.But if you're looking for basic information such as the aperture and shutter speed settings for the many sample photos in the book, forget it, you won't find them here. As well, the coverage is lean, spotty and uneven in key areas. Take lenses for example. There are small sections on lenses for architectural, macro, and scenic photography but nothing on portrait photography. Moreover, the section on portraits is dominated by a lengthy discussion on lighting.I was very disappointed."
1,Non-review,"This actually was the wrong book, it has been sent back and the correct book has been received. Since I didn't read the book I can't rate it."
2,Use this book only if using a non SLR digital camera!!!,"First off this book use old photos for its examples. Secondly it does not tell you anything about professional digital SLR equipment or on how to an SLR to take pictures. I guess it was my fault for buying it I should have read reviews on other sites as well as the ones I read here. Basically if you looking for a professional photography book this in not the book for you, but if your using a point-and-shoot its worth buying. I hope this review was useful to you."
2,Stories interesting/DVD quality lacking,"Most of the stories were interesting and entertaining, but the DVD was lacking in quality. The presentation was a bit amateurish, as if someone had copied it directly from the television program: many pixels and blurry scenes also."
4,Great read !,"I enjoyed this book much more than City of Night. It's very readable and believable, and truly heartbreaking. The writing style is quite unique and takes a bit of getting used to, but the ending is tied together masterfully. (Similar to Picano's ""Like People in History"" with jumping plot lines.) My only criticism is that it is a bit too graphic, but then again, so were the early 80's. I recommend this book."
1,The Coming of the Night by John Rechy,"Ok what was the point of this book? It was nothing more than a study of oversexed, kinky, S&M-obsessed perverts throughout the course of a windy day in Los Angeles. Rechy's overused symbol of the ""Sant'Anas"" was eventually annoying and his pervasive sexual language and scenarios had no artistic merit whatsoever and no purpose other than thoroughly grossing out this reader. Save your time and read a true gay masterpiece- ""Dancer From the Dance""- instead. I regret picking this one up."
2,Warmed Over Rechy!,"While Rechy retains his usual competence in portraying man-to-man action, his misperceptions on SM are still all too present. If you have read Rushes, you don't need this book. Up to the point of covering S&M activity, Rechy does a pretty good job with the gay male libido. However, here (as in rushes) he has no perceptions of the SM dynamic. His details of heavier-duty encounters emerge as ignorant diatribe. He sees a substitution of violence and symbol for sexuality, ignoring the actual perceptions of those engaged in heavier duty action.This tends to invalidate his whole work. Perhaps he should stick to the hustler scene and retire from descriptions of that which he obviously does not understand."
2,"man, what a disappointment","i bought this book on the strength of his earlier works but i'd advise the rest of you to save your pennies. it's not a good book and it's far from his best work. yes, it is sex-filled but the characters are flat and you end up not caring about any of them, even if you can keep them straight [as it were]. there are dozens of books that chronicle this time period in a more engaging way. on top of that, it wasn't even hot."
2,Overrated,"For such a plot driven novel, Rechy's heavy-handedness is its downfall. His characters are two-dimensional and wooden, his plot completely predictable. What does that leave us? Not much, other than graphic sex, which can be found anywhere. This was such a disappointment, as I loved ""City of Night""."
4,Great read!,"I enjoyed this book much more than City of Night. It's very readable and believable, and truly heartbreaking. The writing style is quite unique and takes a bit of getting used to, but the ending is tied together masterfully. (Similar to Picano's ""Like People in History"" with jumping plot lines.) My only criticism is that it is a bit too graphic, but then again, so were the early 80's. I recommend this book."
4,One of Rechy's Best,"The Coming of the Night is one of Rechy's best books to follow City of Night and Numbers. The writing is imaginative, and loaded with fantastic descriptions of the nonverbal aspects of communication, really capturing the emotional nuances of conversation. The complexity of the sexually complicated characters is developed in short recurring vignettes in a masterful use of suspense. Some of the archetypical characters types that reappear in various novels by Rechy are present, with believable life circumstances. Various recognizable gay male identities are portrayed, the men vulnerable in their humanity. The story's tension builds precipitously, resulting in a profound climx foreshadowing the historical events that follow in the next few decades."
1,Not scripturally accurate,"The real story is found in the book of Exodus, the first 14 chapters. The story portrayed on this video/DVD has the same central human figure (Moses) and the same setting (Egypt) but the rest of it is quite imaginative and does not agree with the truth.While I always encourage students to use their imaginations, it is hard to understand how someone could write a story like this and still market it as the story of Moses. Although it's told well and is interesting, it's not simply adding creative material to the story as written.I will be joining those who are throwing away their copies. If you've already bought this, take a good look before letting your children watch it. If you're looking for a good Moses movie, the Prince of Egypt one is much more accurate."
2,Not the best,"The story of Moses told on this DVD isn't the best of the best, but it is fair, and it does tell the story but in a different way. I would say buy this DVD is you're looking for a cheaper version of ""Prince of Egypt"" which anyways this is called ""Prince of the Nile."" Otherwise, I don't recommend this DVD."
5,Great,"Great value, they write just as described. The point is fine and I like having all the colors. Would order them again."
2,Bad Batch,"I am not sure who is to blame here. I have been using Sharpies forever, but this batch was not a good one. 3 of the pens came dry! I shook them, left them upside down, etc, nothing worked. So I would still get sharpies, but next time I will not buy them online. You never know how long they were sitting in storage."
5,so many uses,"I use Sharpies for labeling storage boxes, addressing packages, drawing and getting autographs. I always have a bunch on hand and have been drawing on my backpacks before it was a contest. The name brand ""Sharpie"" has become interchangeable for the item ""marker"" (like Kleenex for tissue or Q-tip for cotton swabs), but I never buy cheap-o store brand markers to save a buck because they dry out and the tips don't stay pointed. Rock on Sharpie!"
3,"Resourceful, but be careful.","Although this contains a lot of information about anti-aging drugs in the world, but we might have to be suspicious about what they are insisting here. They seem to be trying to be objective by reciting academic papers, but we ought to be careful about using these drugs. It might be possible for you to have obsessions about taking these drugs. Be careful."
4,An Oldie But a Great Album,"The reason for only 4 stars is pretty simple. This CD Should have 5 BIG Stars but the production value drops it to the point of ""Where did you buy that Mr. Microphone Dude?"" - HOWEVER, this is really worth buying just because Country Dick, Buddy Blue, Jerry Raney & Rolle Love do a great job - It's the production team that should have been taken behind the woodshed and beaten until they paid back every cent the band invested. The cut, Riverside has a unique quality and the lyrics are so unique to the S. CA mentality, mainly those souls familiar with the Inland Empire that for me, is and was special. Naturally Blue's Gunsale At The Church is a MUST HAVE song. Why this song has never become the Number ONE hit it should be, is a mystery. Country Dick shines in BIG UGLY WHEELS. We miss Country Dick, God bless him, he died with his boots on. Not the Beat Farmers best but compared to most of the hyped up junk out there, this album should be part of your collection."
3,xbox mini wireless controller (2pack),The remotes are great my kids love them when they work right. One of the remotes left thumb stick doesnt work and also the A button doesnt work. Causes them a lot of frustration. Other than this problem the one that works works well
3,to small gamepads...,i cant play my favorite shooting games cause this gamepad have no precision at all..only sport and racing games..
5,Great purchase!,"I was a little sceptical about buying this product after reading the ratings, but it turned out to be a good purchase. I had it connected and was gaming within 10 minutes of taking them out of the box. So far, it works great - easy set up and installation. Have only used it with Fight Night round 3. I will probably do another review after I play with some other games. So far I highly recommend this product."
1,this product sucks,"When i bougth this product i think, this is a god product, so i bought, after a 2 weeks these controllers broken.Dont receive a signal and i went to a electtrics service and them told me, these controllers desnt have repair. please dont bught these."
2,WHY?!!,Why did they even make this? I was playing NCAA football 2005 and it ran out of batteries for the 45th time!Then you ask? then I lost my game 45-52! You need to buy a nonwireless controller if you need another conroller!They run out of batteries 24-7!
4,Keeping my fingers crossed...,"bought this bag a month ago. Carried a laptop everyday... i dont remember stuffing it with more load, already few stitches are coming out... and just hoping that this bag will last for atleast 6-8months... i liked the bag though... :)"
4,It's a pack that you carry on your back,The backpack is sturdy with enough pockets and few frills but it works well. The only problem I have with it is the straps slip and loosen.
4,well worth the small chunk of change,"as the other reviewer pointed out, this thing is great if you need to replace the stem on an older/cheap bike. much lighter than the big lead weights posing as stems out there (mongoose, i'm looking at you!). seems pretty durable, and most importantly, no bar slippage. however, it would of been nice if the main bolt was hollow. just in case i ever decided to run a front break/rear break gyro setup again. doubt i ever will, but the option's always nice. other than that small complaint, good quality stem for your threaded forks, that won't cost you an arm and a leg."
2,Black Ops Stem by Bulletproof,"No good, waste of time and money. Stem bolt does not need to be adjusted with an allen tool and stem bolt is too thin."
1,O'Brien',"I thought this was going to be funny because it was in the stand-up genre. It was insightful, but I lost all respect for Conan to see how he treats people."
3,Couldn't Get Into It,"I was really excited about getting to see this film. I love documenteries, I like Conan and I wanted to know more about what happened. Unfortunately, after about 30 minutes I still couldn't get into it. It was mostly about the comedy tour he did after he left NBC and I didn't find it funny...at all. I was really disappointed since it was a $6.99 rental. When it's free, I may try it again."
2,Be more funny...!,"It is really a shame to see how Conan treats almost everyone around him (except for his family maybe). Just skip to minute 47 and check out how Jack McBrayer (aka Kenneth Parcell of 30 Rock) is warmly welcomed or should I rather say humiliated - maybe it is because 30 Rock is a NBC show??? I admit Conan acts funny in parts but his spoiled behavior really ruins the show here. When I watched this I felt like he is masking his egomaniac attributes and hunger for encouragement by alleged ""jokes"". He is complaining and fishing for compliments all the time instead of being creative, witty and charismatic. To me it just felt dumb. I am sure Conan O'Brien can do better than this. He did better in the past for sure."
5,Great flick!!,"Gives cool insight from Conan himself as to what happened with his show and his response to it. Conan has a lot of talent and the drive to continue in show business, he proves that here."
4,Needed Dynamite,"While it's really eye opening how the stress of a tour and the entertainment business comes off on an everyman (which is how I've always seen and connected to Conan), I felt like there could have been just a little bit something more to make this story interesting. Maybe if we had seen contract negotiations in process to get Conan back on TV, or more Jack White, or maybe if they drove their tour bus over an opening bridge to escape the police during a shoot-out, this film would have been more engrossing. Still a really great film though and very interesting. 4 1/4 *'s out of 5, or 8 1/2 *'s out of 10.For a more detailed review, visit OrganizedRemains.Blogspot.com or OrganizedRemains.com"
3,Maybe better with disc...,"I love Conan, so of course getting to see him in anything is a treat, but as a documentary, I don't think this works very well at all. It's like the narrative set up nicely at the beginning and concluded wonderfully at the end isn't supported at all in the middle. In the middle it just becomes ""Let's follow them on the road! Doesn't it look exhausting but kind of awesome!"" I don't know. Maybe if I had the disc and could watch all the interview outtakes, additional scenes and extra interview with Conan, it would have been more satisfying...but then I would just have to wonder why that wasn't in there in the first place."
2,"it has funny elements. but, kind of a drag movie.","I thought it was alright, but it dragged on too much. didn't like it as much! pretty cool Kristin interviewed him afterwards. she's so sexy."
4,Need an extra key that is programmed to the car,This module needs to have an RFID key inside the module to work. They should make that clear when they sell this module.
2,Can't use with Audi fobs,"I purchased this to install in an 02 Audi A6. The Audi key fob is large and will not fit in this unit. You'll need to buy a smaller valet key from Audi to make this work. I suspect VW's are the same.Note that the transponder receiver is on very stiff and brittle wires which break easily - when I decided to use this on my Subaru instead, they broke, and I had to buy another unit.Next time I'm buying something locally and having it installed."
1,Doesnt work,"Had a mechanic install it, couldnt get it to work, and no tech support. Look in the paper, pay $129 installed."
2,Does what is supposed to but you can do it for $0,"Okay this product does what it is supposed to do but like other comments have said it requires a spare key to put in the box and placed somewhere in the dashboard. If you're planning to install a remote starter yourself you will most likely have to take the cover off the steering column, so save yourself the cost of this product and take that spare key, place it next to your ignition where it won't interfere with moving parts, secure it with some insulated copper wire, and there you have it, you've just create your own bypass."
1,Terrible bypass module,Not the greatest idea to leave a key inside the car. Easily to take key and drive off. I couldn't get the thing to work anyway. More of a hassle than anything. Spend the extra money and get one more vehicle specific. It will save you time and money in the log run. Trust me. Worthless product.
3,Spare key required for Fords,"Ford vehicles require a spare transponder key to be left in this unit at all times. This was not completely clear before I purchased it. Luckily I was able to buy a key for under $15 on Amazon and got it cut for free at the local hardware store. After programming the key, I broke the end off and placed it inside the bypass module. It works as intended but the added effort and expense of the spare key would justify the purchase of a more expensive and more secure bypass module."
1,Save your money,"This is a piece of junk. Spare yourself the headache that comes with this product. Initially I could not get any installer who would use this bypass. I finally got one who explained to me why others would not want to use it, he gave it a try. Guess what? the very next day, the car we installed it on had its battery run down because of this. It is also not safe because you've to leave a spare (valet) key in the bypass. We bought a new one for $65 which has been working just fine. Amazon, please stop recommending this junk with the key-less entry systems you sell."
5,Another Excellent Publication By Lonnie Bird,"Publications by Lonnie Bird are always excellent and informative to woodworkers, and this one achieves the same high level. I am enjoying reading Illustrated Guide to Using Woodworking Tools and looking forward to more time in the workshop with this publication."
3,OKish book,"This is a good book. However, Lonnie Bird writes not as clear as Gary Rogowski, Andy Ray or especially Kelly Mehler. This is also applied to his ""Band saw"" book.There is no clear analysis of cons and pros of different tools. Use of the tools does not contain alternative approaches too. He really thinks that only high end equipment is useful."
5,9/16-in Froster bit,"Great price. Bit is sharp, and drills a nice clean hole. Did not chip out edge of hole. I would recommend this product."
3,Not 100% flat...,"I got this zero clearance insert for my Delta TS350. Unfortunately, it is not 100% flat. It is close, but close doesn't count. It was too low in the front & back. I had to use shims to get it flat, and it ended up being two different size shims. In the front I used a very very thin metal washer and in the back I used a slightly thicker rubber washer. Also, you must store these inserts flat. It is not a stable material so if you don't store it flat it will warp. I gave it three stars because it is better than nothing once you get it shimmed up."
2,pure bodhran,"I am a bodhran player and I ordered this title much to my disappointment. Although there are a few innovative pieces,on the whole it doesn't do much for the bodrahn's rep. I swear there is also a cut from the earliest recording in America of Irish music. This is not pure anything,just the same old hat with a few new feathers and electronic doodads.Celtic music is not Jazz and although it may feature one instrument as the lead voice the instumental support of the others gives it the cohesion that originated as the Ceili sound.Not a concert but a conversation. For those of us always wanting to improve, my greatest wish would be a recording that sounded like you were sitting next to the drummer at a session. Any brilliant music producers out there?"
4,Another ghost story -- maybe,"""When the jury of which Roger Collins is chairman finds Harriet Barnes guilty of murder, she swears vengeance on the entire Collins family, and then kills herself. Soon Celia Dalton a guest at Collinwood, starts suffering strange spells. Each time she does someone at Collinwood is violently. Has Harriet Barnes taken over her spirit, making the innocent girl a blood-thirty killer? Can Barnabas and Quentin save Celia - and the Collins family - from this menace out of the crypt?"" (The plot synopsis is taken from the back cover of the first edition paperback. #17 in the series.)"
4,Hint At Riot To Tint Hair = Ultimate Rhino Hit,"Accordion, violin & banjo (or sometimes dobro, harmonica and viola) make a bluegrass/Klezmer kind of sound, although the compositions tend toward a more cinematic sweep. Like Messiaen's ""Quatuor pour la fin du temps"" the instrumentation here feels accidental, circumstantial even. THT wanders between salon music and fractured dance band, never really deciding who, or what they are.Or maybe what they are is this fuzzy in-between, where nothing is what it seems?Helium is the second lightest element."
3,"If you have read A Borderland Journal, don't bother","I am a huge Quinney fan but am quite disappointed with this effort. The book takes large sections from his earlier books, especially A Borderland Journal to include again in this later publication. Many references relate to photographs previously published. These photos are not included. If you can't see the photo now you may not get the point he is trying to make. On the other hand, for those who have not shared in the meditative journey of Quinney previously, this little book may start you down a rewarding path. I especially recommend him to photographers and journal writers."
5,The book provides an excellent introduction to the subject.,I read all the editions of Peter Jackson's Expert System book. All the editions were equally good with respect to the developments of the subject at that time.The current edition covers a wide disciplines of subject with a very simple but elegant style of presentation. I liked the book for its coverage and simplicity. I recommend the book for my graduate students specializing in knowledge-based computing. I wish you all to see the book once and recommend it to your colleagues.
4,Solid entertainment,"I enjoyed this book. OK, the plot's a little thin and some of the secondary characters a little two-dimensional but the writing is pacy and the dialog is realistic and witty. JT sets the scene real nicely too. I've never been to Shropshire but on the basis of this book, I think I'd like it! Solid entertainment."
3,Great series but incomplete,"This is a great series, but the DVD is missing some episodes. Visit Wikipedia for an episode guide."
3,Just ok,"I decided to take a chance on this book after having purchased another Gooseberry Patch book, ""Coming Home with Gooseberry Patch"" which i had found to be absolutely amazing. Every recipe in ""Coming Home"" was something that i wanted to try because they sounded so yummy and simple to make. I had not seen a copy of ""Get-Togethers"" before ordering but thought i would give it a try for the price. I was a little disappointed by the condition of the book (next time i will read my quality descriptions better - this was 100% my fault - no intent by the seller to mislead on condition). The book is ok - i will be giving the ""Bursting with Berries Bundt Cake"" a shot - but the overall feel of the book is much more ""blah"" than i expected."
5,Really Fun Book!,"I've been a Gooseberry Patch customer from day one and I have missed their catalogs, merchandise, and old style books. This new book is similar to other Desinger Cook Books I own, but it is a really nice book with some great recipes. Photos are fun and very country, and a few of the recipes are really simple and innovative. Sweet Tea and it's presentation is fabulous! Thanks for a good book!"
2,The Jewels of Miriam Haskell,"I had so much looked forward to reading this book that when it arrived I was disappointed. The text was rather disorganised in places and so it was hard to follow the points the author was making about the early life and various influences upon Miriam Haskell. Most of the book was focused on one designer and most of the pictures, although they are very nice pictures, came from the same few sources. I was hoping for a carefully researched piece which told me a lot more about Haskell and gave a much wider assortment of the pieces she designed. The book left you asking more questions than it answered and wanting more variety then it presented."
2,Not suitable for Yoga,"This a thick, comfortable mat but it should not be billed as a yoga mat. It is too thick for balancing poses. It may work well for pilates but is not useful for yoga. I'm disappointed to have paid a lot of money for a mat that I cannot use for one of its primary purposes."
2,"Some stories OK, but not really Lovecraftian","This collection is an original anthology, in which a bunch of authors write stories specifically for the collection with a central theme in common. As often happens in such collections, the writing quality is uneven, and the ""common theme"" elements often seem like they've just been thrown in. This one is actually better than what I've come to expect from original anthologies, though.Writing stories based on H.P. Lovecraft's work is a perilous endeavor because HPL fans can be pretty demanding. If you go to www.dejanews.com and search for miskatonic anthology, you can find some discussion in the alt.horror.cthulhu newsgroup about why people did or didn't like the stories in this collection"
4,Dream Bod,The P90x is great!!! It gives you results and really pushes your body!! I am 3 weeks in and can already see a difference and look forward to reviewing the after pics at the end of my 90 days.
5,P90X,"I recieved my P90X just over 3 weeks ago, in the process of other things popping up on my screen i decided to abandan this buying process and went directly to the P90X web site and bought their product for 120 dollars insted of the 80 dollars from Amazon. Turns out I bought both products because of my poor computer skills. The Amazon product showed up 4 days earlier than the P90X web site. Comparing the both I couldn't tell one from the other. The seller with Amazon delivered a great product and would reccomend this seller to other buyers. I sold the Amazon product to a friend for the excact price. I took the hickey on the P90X product because it was my fault to begin with. Been doing the P90X for 3 1/2 weeks now, its tough but I've lost 12 pounds and really look better. Because of the way my muscles have developed over the last couple of weeks it looks like I've lost more."
4,P90X Reviews Does P90X Work? The Reason P90X2 Workout Results Inspirational Transformation,"Length:: 2:58 MinsSure there are plenty of P90X reviews on Amazon. Why watch my video? I'm showing you how I use this workout like real people use it and get real results, not like some sales person. Is it worth the money? For me it is. It works; it's workouts are brutal; it builds strength; it's simple - what more can you ask for?O boy, working out with P90X is the reason that I feel great! If you want to get into fantastic shape, so simple to use and so awesome and invigorating, get P90X today."
2,The DVD's Were To Defective To Enjoy!,"I finally started this workout plan on 1-15-2012, however the DVD's were so damaged/scratched that I couldn't get through the first week! I wouldn't recommend buying this product from anyone but BEACHBODY! With BEACHBODY you can get a warranty for less than $10 which will cover damage to the dvd's for life! I had to learn the hard way! Waiting on my refund from this seller! Product sold was totally unacceptable & not usable!!!!"
4,Tough to stick with but worth it.,Great product if your serious about looking good. Difficult to stay on the program but well worth it if your serious.
4,Good but think I got a counterfeit copy?,"P90X is a great workout but I heard about a lot of counterfeits that did not work well. I thought if I bought on Amazon from a vendor w/98% positive and 1,000's of transactions I could avoid getting a counterfeit. It said ""Used (Like New)"" in the description, but it was obviously never opened. The booklet gives it away (I think) as it has more ridiculous typo's in the fitness guide than you can shake a stick at. Not just misspells, but ""("" for t, ""^"" for A, and other ridiculous stuff (literally 100's of them)that can only be possible from someone who does not use the A - Z alphabet. Maybe...a Chinese countereiter? Who knows. The DVDs have worked so far, but I hate getting burned and participating in illegal stuff like this. I can only assume that the ""Used, (Like New)"" is a way of covering up that the vendor has hundreds to sell?"
3,Many of the CDs are scratched and do not play the entire one hour long workout. Unhappy.,Unhappy because many of the CDs are scratched and therefore cannot play the entire hour long video.
2,Great at first but lousy as time progressed,When I first got this I was simply ecstatic. I did three weeks of the program before it changed up and noticed that one particular DVD didn't work. I at first tried to brush it up but little by little DVD's started to become harder and harder to get to start. Now I have two DVD's that won't work no matter what. I'm very very disappointed. I've contacted the seller in hopes to return.
4,P90X - Father's Day Gift,My husband was very excited to receive this for Father's Day. He's been thinking about getting it for months.
5,Excellent program for those who want to be challenged!,"I bought this program wanting results. Been on it a few weeks and am noticing changes. I have been working out for some time and this program is very challenging, so if your a beginner, I would start on an easier program first."
5,P90X is a great exercise system!,"This is one of the most effective exercise routines I've ever tried. It is extremely challenging but they offer alternatives to help users build up to their maximum fitness level. There are three different approaches to the 90 day cycle, with suggestions for maintaining your fitness level upon completion of the program. Some equipment is needed, including a pull-up/chin-up bar, free weights and/or exercise bands and a floor mat. There is an accompanying nutrition plan that creates some great eating habits to help maximize the exercise program."
5,"Decide, Commit, Succeed","P90X is exactly what it says. EXTREME fitness, no way, it is an extreme lifestyle. This gives you all of the tools to become the absolute best you can be. Total lifestyle program here. No joke! Follow the program and get results! I'm living proof and thousands of others are as well. Tony Horton gives it all to you, how to eat right, how to workout right, how to burn fat, carve up muscle, and get fit.Commit to the program and succeed. There's no pill that will fix you being out of shape. It takes eating right, and exercise/fitness program to fix your body.Commit for 90 days and see what kind of results you get!"
5,P90X,"The product is perfect - brand new, as described by seller. Shipping was extremely prompt. I couldn't be more satisfied. Thank you, seller."
2,Ugh,"Hated, hated, hated this workout. The host is the most annoying person on earth. I had to mute the dvd's just to not have to listen to him. The yoga is the best one..... That's only because the host shuts his trap for the last 20 minutes."
3,P90X Ordering,"I just received my P90X program. Had to immediately turn around and purchase another $200 of workout tools. Then there are the suppliments (not for me right now) and a myriad of other accessory and workout regimes that they are selling on the website. The program may be great, and I'll know more about that in the coming weeks, but once you buy in just remember you will be repetively buying and paying for a lot of ""stuff"" that you may not have been made aware of during the initial sell. Here's hoping I can stay with it."
3,Boring,"I'm rating this product a 3/5 for no fault of it's own, just simply because it's too boring. I thought because I live in Cleveland and the winter's can be tough, p90x would be the way to go. Alas, it turns out I would rather suffer hiking in snowy Metroparks than be shut up in basement trying to get through the CD's. I'm sure results would come but I just can't bear to stick to the program."
