5,Lovin the Star Trek Ethics!,"This is my second purchase of the book because I made the awful mistake of loaning it to someone who wouldn't give it back. So instead of being so angry I took the advice of the Star Trek Ethics and followed steps to create a perfect union once again. I love the book and think as a person that watches the Star Trek Series/All of Them so much the book is a perfect companion and way to revisit the consciousness and actually live it! ""Live Long and Prosper"""
3,A Pleasant Primer to Aristotelian Philosophy,"This is a very pleasant primer to the basic questions that were discussed by the early philosophers. The topics range over a very wide spectrum. Occasionally, the reader gets the chance to look deeper, but for the most part we are left looking for something more.This book's encyclopedic nature makes it an excellent introduction to philosophical issues. It would not satisfy readers past the undergraduate college level.Despite its limited depth, the book achieves its purpose marvelously. The questions are opened in as fascinating a way as can be expected for fans of Star Trek, and the discussion is capable and engaging."
3,Good for those Monday mornings,"""All Hope In Eclipse"" is a favor done to this genre, there's no doubt about it, and ""Born In A Burial Gown"" is a CoF classic. And indeed, there isn't much time nor reason to cry for having spent a buck on this disc, because most of the songs stand out in a way or another. The second half doesn't quite make it through, however, with many songs sinking into the swamp of gothic clich√©s, but ""Black Goddess Rises II"" has its great moments, and ""Scorched Earth Erotica"" makes for a fine ending theme."
4,Cradle churn out another great piece of metal,Shorlty after the release of Midian comes another masterpiece from the dark british band Cradle Of Filth. Their music seems to evolve with every album and this is a very good example.. Mixing new songs like Born in a burial gown with remakes of some of their old material like Summer dying fast really shows how much the band has taken a fresher more technical approach to their sound.. The guitars sound great and so does the drumming... For me the high point is the excellent keyboards... Brilliant! And what about the sisters of mercy cover? Sheer genius! So if you want a good mix of classic COF aswell as some of their new stuff they go for this album .. you wont be disappointed.
2,Sell Outs,"It is so blatant that Cradle sold out on From The Cradle To Enslave...I still enjoy their music, but it doesn't compare to classics such as Cruelty And The Beast or The Principle Of Evil Made Flesh. With the more recent CD's they have toned down their music and lost their atmospheric and epic songs. They no longer have that special feel in their music....now with the departure of Robin and the Sony deal, they will go downhill even more, attract more Mall-Metal fans and bring recognition to the True Black Metal scene (which is VERY bad). This band has let me down...."
1,Another one of my favorite bands sells-out!,"I can't explain my utter disapointment with CoF's latest effort. Now that CoF are with Sony, exspect to see 10-13 year olds wearing CoF shirts and saying stuff like: ""Wow! This band is as 'hard-core' as Limp Bizkit, Korn, Linkin Park, and Papa Roach!"" Then MTV will showcase CoF as the next ""big thing."" Oh yeah, the songs that were re-recorded were much better on The Principle Of Evil Made Flesh Album."
1,What happened ?,"If you're a true Cradle of Filth fan, you would understand. They completely went downhill. I saw it coming after the Cradle to Enslave album came out. I should've known they would start blowing themselves."
4,surprisingly good,"I'll admit that the vocals were hard to get around at 1st listen, but give it chance and you'll realize they fit the music and atmosphere quite well. The performances are terrific, especially the drumming with almost impossibly fast double kick. And the songs are well crafted. I'm not sure how Dani Filth can keep his voice on the road, but on this recording he pulls out all the stops to wrench emotion from the songs. Not a bad effort at all."
4,This rocks except for two things...,"Cradle of Filth really has the crappiest guitar sound. And Dani's new shriek is WAY too prominent on this album. Dani is such a girl, and it shows on this album, but it's pretty damn evil and it totally rocks."
2,Some more below average work from Cradle,"So after midian came out, I pretty much lost all faith in cradle of filth. Gone are the days of music like in the cd ""Principle of Evil Made Flesh"". I remember when I first heard these guys and how much I enjoyed the uniqueness of the music. With this new release, it just shows the band going downhill even more. Don't get me wrong, this cd isn't horrible, but it's just not as good as the older stuff. There are a few songs on it that i like, but the songs that were redone, i feel that they just butchered them. I feel that this is a good cd for people, just getting into the black metal genre of music, but if you have been into it for a while, go for something else such as ""dissection"", ""satyricon"", ""emperor"", or maybe even some ""dimmu borgir""...."
1,This album is crap!!,"I like Cradle of Filth, but this album ...!! This is not the way black metal should be!!!"
3,"Overall: dark atmosphere, worth listening to","from cradle of filth's new cd, i enjoyed listening to it; it was worth the chance i gave to it! they still have a dark atmosphere, deep lyrics, and that beautiful, natural, evil sound.if you're a hardcore cradle of filth fan, you probably wont enjoy bitter suites to succubi as much as the others; dani's voice has actually grown slightly pathedic, falling apart within some of his screeches. the song structure is slightly within the 'verse-chorus-verse' stage (of course, still containing surprising elements for structure change) rather than epic poetry falling within a dark, parallel atmosphere of maniacle, yet genious orchestrations.the whole cd in general only gets 3 stars for having a few incredible songs (such as Suicide and Other Comforts -- in my opinion) as well as interesting artwork, poetry, and the evil/crazy, orchestrated sound i enjoy."
2,Yawn!,"This was the second Cradle Of Filth album after I bought Cruelty And The Beast, and back then I was glad from my purchase, but now, considering that I have a wider collection of black metal albums, I can tell that this album, like Damnation And A Day, is a BIG dissapointment. This EP is the proof that COF began to loose its touch and that they lost their passion to play true black metal music. Unless you're a hardcore fan of these now mainstream ""black"" metalheads, don't buy this piece of crap. And stay away from Damnation And A Day!"
2,"Not bad, BUT...","The game installed and ran smoothly on my 2.7Gig machine. The only slowdowns were during the Autosaves. Graphics are decent if not spectacular and the manual is complete and well written.Having said that, the game is boring as heck. The campaign is linear, with little choice about what to do or where to go next. As someone else mentioned, the horribly mangled Elizebethian dialect would get you thrown out of most Ren Faires. Combat options are limited to: Run forward and hack until your health bar drops into the red, then run away, or stand off and shoot arrows, chuck spears, or shoot fireballs and hope nobody gets close to you. I found it a pretty pointless hack-and-slash where I could cere less about the outcome and even less about the depressingly one-dimensional characters."
2,I'm ready to launch my laptop over this one!,"It's not the laptop's fault. It's that this game is so aggravating. It's a cute premise, and I held out hope for it.The campaign was ok. As others have said, it's pretty linear, and gets dull after a while.The RPG section was ok while I was playing a male character. When I changed to playing a female character, it was like being drop-kicked into the middle of Frat Row on Beer Bash night while wearing a miniskirt. My female character gets hit on, gets stupid things said to her, says really stupid things (gawd-awful 'thou' lingo not counted), and it gets old, fast.Not to mention that the game messages were not looked over by anyone who had a native-level grasp of the English language. It was charming at first, now it's just obnoxious. If you're looking for a time-killer, this could possibly be ok. Be warned though, your blood pressure may rise."
5,A perfect instructional guide to becoming a better person.,"This book was very informative and helpful on how to better myself, mentally and spiritually! It's an easy read, which is good when reading a self-help book. Some pieces of literature get too complex when it comes to describing how to visualize or meditate(i.e-10 steps on how to get what you want and do these steps every other day). This book is clear and consise. Miss Tarpley tells you what she's learned and how you should apply what she's learned from The Goddess to become in touch with your spirituality and you as a person. If you are interested in becoming more of a spiritual being and seeing your life change for the better, read The Tao of The Goddess!"
3,Whats the point?,"Sonic Adventure is an easy game to play, the only part needing assistance being the final boss: Perfect Chaos.Whats the the point of needing a guide is the game is easy enough to figure out? Save you're 50 bucks for something else, like, a router to get your Dreamcast online. Really."
3,A Darkness More Than Night,"I have read and enjoyed Michael Connelly's books and enjoyed his character Bosch. I hated - really hated - what he did to Bosch in this book. I just don't see how it fits his character. The author has gone to such lengths to build this man - he had a dark side - he didn't have a decadent side. His whole life was following the rules. Even his own word ""What did I do?"" and his resolve to start over - it doesn't smell right. And The ex-agents marital problems - unresolved and unreal. Not to mention the physical trials of a HEART TRANSPLANT RECEIPIENT. Please.The ending ruined the entire book for me."
4,Great Headphones!!!,"While these headphones are not the newest technology and all that, they look and work great...plus they are quite affordable. The sound is very clear and I am happy with my purchase. And for anyone trying to look for a picture.. the wire is NOT L shapped, but the wire if very flexible so it will not get in the way. I would reccomend to anyone and everyone!!"
5,"Very well written, real accounting of events","I have read many WWII books, most by Ambrose. I enjoyed this one because it makes the reader feel like he/she is there. I took it to be a fairly factual and enlightening book.I would and have recommended it to others."
5,Popeye76,What a wonderful book. It was a good read from page 1 to the end. It was a very well written account of what these men did during the Europe campaign. It was amazing to be reminded that most of these men were in their lower 20's and younger.
5,Excellent,Great read. Enjoyed first person account. Brings to the forefront an on the ground view of the war. He was a lucky man to survive.
5,WWII ETO Account,Love to read actual accounts of WWII. Have not come across one like this until now. Excellent story. Must read
3,Some good History,"Worth buying. However there are a lot of WWII battle histories out there so if pinching pennies is important, move on."
3,Good Unit History,"Kind of like the old TV show COMBAT. Well written.Thank You all who served in WWII Europe, and elsewhere."
3,Very Informative,"This is not fiction and there is no character development and story plot. It is a good true life account of what it was like to be on-the-ground during a war. Sometime I wondered how the Allies won this war, but then I thought, at least in Europe, Germany and Italy were using some of the same tactics. This was a quick read that was not over powered by dates and names that could make you feel like you were reading a dry history book."
4,Another Well Written ETO Memoir,"George Wilson was a replacement office assigned to the 4th infantry division who fought in Normandy, Northern France, the Hurtgen Forest and the Bulge before being wounded in the spring of '45. This book is highly descriptive of front line soldiering in the ETO with vivid battle scenes. There is a good balance of analysis with action. It is not as breezily written as Burgett's books but doesn't feel ""literary"" ala' Brothers Karamazov as Roll me Over by Ganttner tends to feel. I enjoyed every page and was sad to finish it. If you love reading 1st person narratives of combat in World War Two then buy this book."
5,ONE OF THE BETTER FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS OF WWII,"I did like this one. The writing was real and very well done. From the first page, I was hooked. This is one of the better first hand accounts of this war I have read. The author has wonderful recall of events and make them pop out and come alive with his narrative. I should think this would make a wonderful ""how to"" book for first person writers. The author is always quite realistic in his discriptions of events and places. Not only is his story inspiring, it is quite informative and I do recommend you add this one to your collection for a reread..I know I did. Highly recommend."
4,Review of If You Survive,I have enough combat experience to know that surviving it depends upon both skill and luck. George Wilson had an ample supply of both.It's a good read.
3,Great story; great man; mediocre writing,"Lt. George Wilson is no doubt one of the bravest men I've ever heard about. But his writing style is stiff. And, just when you want to know more about a particular engagement, he shifts gears and talks about another one. I did chuckle 3/4 of the way through, after all his horrendous tales, he mentions that they are getting some R&R near the Ardennes! If I was to fight in a war, this is the man I would want as my leader! I agree with another reviewer that this would make a fantastic screenplay, as long as another writer injects some life into the language. My homage to Mr. Wilson--he's a great soldier and a great American."
4,"Exceptional man, uninspired writing.","Without a doubt George Wilson was a courageous and stalwart soldier. However, his book could have used a co-author to give it some structure and a bit more emotion. It's an easy read, though, and contains some great examples of how a WWII company-grade officer carries out tactics on the platoon and company level. This book is on the Army Chief of Staff's Professional Reading List for cadets, soldiers, and junior NCOs."
3,One man's War: Inspiring courage and spectacular luck,"Men experience war in different ways and some men have good wars, some have bad. George Wilson had a good war. He seemed perfectly equipped, with his Michigan State football scholarship and strong moral beliefs, as well as an essential dose of fabulous luck. As Wilson takes us through France (he landed after D-Day)to Paris and then to the Ardennes, we marvel at how anyone could have survived the carnage of Hitler's retreat across Europe.Wilson's account is highly informative but necessarily self-centered. His writing style makes it difficult for the reader to understand much about Wilson's mostly nameless comarades, even the fellow officer whose death reduced the writer to bitter tears. This apart, the book is a fascinating insight, complete with some unanswered questions and stunning acts of bravery set amid the desparate final months of Hitler's war."
5,Engrossing strategic and personal detail of a soldier's life,"Mr. Wilson's account of WWII from his landing at Normandy to the doors of Berlin is a completely engrossing tale. He presents vivid details of the environment, the action , the pain, and the suffering of fighting in the European theater as a foot soldier.The reader learns how fast these young men grew up and became tactical experts on fighting the enemy and fighting to survive. At times when Mr. Wilson describes a battle he was involved in, you start to formulate what he would have done and race to the next page to learn the outcome.Chilling accounts of what it meant to survive in WWII and just how grueling and inhospitable it was being a soldier.An excellent read."
4,If you survive,"This is a good history book. It is very detailed in the description of the troops, movements and the details of battle. It is well written and makes me wonder how anybody survived and I can certainly understand the scars of battle emotionally after this book."
5,Great Read!,"I read another book about WWII prior to this one, and was a little nervous on how I would like a book from an entirely different point of view. However, I was not disappointed in the least bit. This man shows such great courage and dedication to his men and his country, yet is completely down to earth and straightforward. Another book on my list that is a must read! I believe every American should read books like ""If You Survive. . .""; it is a firsthand encounter of just what was paid for our everyday freedoms. This book not only makes me proud, but also thankful to be an American!!!"
4,An amazing tale of endurance.,A well written account of a junior officer growing up into a seasoned and experienced solider who appears not to have been appreciated by the army. The narrative is sensitive and informative.
5,Intense first person narrative,"You've already read Band of Brothers, Seven Roads to Hell, and other accounts of our infantrymen in Europe during WWII and wonder why you should read another? Two reasons: First, George Wilson perfectly captures the intensity of battle and the struggle for survival from the beginning to the very end of his candid first-person perspective of the war. Second, Wilson embodies the citizen soldier of that era - wise beyond his years, amazingly resourceful, and quite frankly the main reason we won the war.Like Winters and Burgett, Wilson is a true American hero, and not just because of his acts of bravery (of which there are many) but also for his honor and humanity while enduring the most extreme conditions imaginable. A rewarding read that stands out from the pack."
4,Oustanding read in every way,"If You Survive is a classic first person account of the Normandy invasion and subsequent battles. Quite frankly, it's not just a good history book but an excellent study in leadership and often found on the recommended reading list for junior military officers.The title says it all. Just before the invasion George Wilson's commanding officer said, ""If you survive, I'll promote you.""I won't spoil the book with an in depth review of all the events. But this remains a very interesting book about the 4th Infantry in Europe during the second world war. It's easy to read, well written and very descriptive. Of the well over 250 books in my WWII history collection this one remains one of my favorites."
3,Pretty good,"This book was written well after the war by the sound of it. Not a whole lot of detail. The writer does give a pretty good view of what he remembered it to be like. Not one of the great WW2 books, but a pretty good read."
4,Worth reading,This is a firsthand account of a soldier's experience during the Second World War. A little light on emotion and color but still worth reading.
3,from an early post war baby,"i was looking for personal stories by fighters and survivors of WW2 well i got many of those - many intriguing and stirring moments amidst a long long list of campaign after campaign. i began to wonder how anyone could remember each one so individually amidst the murderous action after acion, and with a somewhat ''look how wonderful i was'' emphasis it became a boring list and would have been good with a lot of pruning to pick out some highlights instead i found it more a list for the school or army historical records and wondered how much was fantasy in the end"
5,Koeran At A Glance - Delightful!,"I found this book to be quite helpful. I just came back from Korea last month and the book helped me a great deal. I taught myself Hangul and I learned quite a few words from this book. The grammar section is also helpful. And even when I didn't know how to say something, my hosts would pick up the book and look for the phrase in Korean and then point to the English equivalent for me. Between that book and there Korean-English Dictionary, we did quite well."
3,Its ok but It could have included more vocab & lessons,"I expected much more advanced vocabulary like the ""Japanese At A Glance"" by Barrons. I compared the two & the japanese one is much better, it has at least 100-150 pages more of lessons & vocabulary. I bought this one thinking it would be like the Japanese one but it wasn't so I was a bit disappointed but it's ok. It's still good and you will learn a lot from it but it won't teach you a lot of advanced or intermediate level Korean which is what I needed..."
5,LOVE IT!,"Nine months ago I started dating a Korean man and he was fluent in English and Korean and I wanted to learn some words. I found this to be the best tool I have come across so far book wise! Also if you get this book and have a hard time with pronouncing the words you want a free online source to help with speaking korean is ""mylanguages dot org"" and go to korean section. But for me having a book right in front of you and learning a few words a week works best for me. It is small so it can easily fit in to a purse."
4,you gotta appreciate bluegrass...,"...if you're going to like this one. I do, and I think this is a great effort. In the liner notes, Earle says he's trying to come up with a song that will come a standard for bluegrass players. There are plenty of candidates here--Carrie Brown, Dixieland and Long Lonesome Highway Blues come to mind. However, if you are not a fan of bluegrass or Steve Earle, you're not going to like this one (whereas I think his last couple of CDs -- El Corozan and I Feel Alright -- would appeal to anyone with functioninn eardrums). Here's hoping you meet the criteria!"
5,Another great one from Steve,"Although I was originally hesitant about Steve's bluegrass debut, he has once again put together a great album. With the help of the Del McCoury Band, Steve has ventured into new territory and has done so quite well. I really enjoyed the CD and hearing Steve and the Del McCoury Band live is even better. If the tour comes to your town, make sure you attend. The live show was awesome."
3,"It's just that the Emperor.. well, um, you see...","Sorry Steve, but I was disappointed with this record. I consider myself a Steve Earle fan. ""Train A' Comin'"" is a masterpiece and my copies of ""I Feel Allright"", ""El Corazon"", and ""Guitar Town"" are all ragged from use. So how can you go wrong with S.E and the awesome DMcoury Band? Songs, songs, songs. ""The Mountain's"" biggest problem is that the songs are not there. (Track two is ""You Know the Rest"" with different words)The honesty and intensity of previous S.E. records is A.W.O.L. ( ""Harlan Man"" and ""Long, Lonesome Highway Blues"" do stand out) Even Steve's trademark growling delivery can't take a fork out of this one. The Del McCoury Band sounds great. Where's the lead vocal for Del? Check out ""The Family"" or ""Cold Hard Facts""."
3,school stuff,"we had to buy this because a couple of songs have been used in ""Sprinboard"" English framework.We have enjoyed the diffrent type of music."
3,An interesting experiment but a mediocre recording.,"You would think that Steve Earle's songs and the Del McCoury Band would yield a knockout recording but it didn't. While I am a big fan of both and generally recognise Steve to be one of the best Folk/Country/Rock songwriters of the last 20 years, I feel that the songs just didn't ""cut it"" and that the bluegrass arrangements seemed ""wrong"" for the songs. When you combine this with the somewhat derivative nature of several of the songs that are clearly borrowed from older traditional melodies and lyrics, it's hard to get too excited about this recording. It just seems as if it was a rushed project. Of course, the irony is that it hit the charts at a higher position than his last recording EL CORAZON which is to the contrary, an excellent recording. Go figure! It looks as if Steve's new independence from the major labels may not yield better choices or better music!!"
5,Bluegrass with an edge,"This CD is a stroke of genius. Steve Earl leverages the superb talents of some of the finest bluegrass musicians in the business and mixes in a hearty dose of his own creative talent to produce this timeless classic. The lyrics are amazingly sophisticated for bluegrass and the words to ""Kerry Brown"" are enough to keep a shrink busy for 2 months. Steve Earl has been crossed off a few Christmas Card lists lately because of that whole ""American talaban"" thing, but this CD was recorded years before all that. It's really worth listening to if you're a bluegrass fan or want to hear the Del McCoury band without Del singing lead all the time."
2,I guess i should have known from the price.,I guess I should have known from the price. The fabric is very thin and almost see through. The color is nice though.
4,Earth Bound,"Good map quality, but some marbles were chipped which was distracting when examining the marbles."
3,Skip the book and do some research on the web.,"Even though I loved the hole HTML Goodies series, this particular book I feel has a lot of information about nothing. Don't get me wrong there's a lot of good info in it but they are rather quick tips that you don't need at the moment. I personally could never find anything useful and ended up finding out more stuff on the web. I say skip this book and just use the INTERNET as your place for inspiration and ideas."
5,Very well done reference.,"This is a large-but not too large-dictionary of Islamic terms, people, events, cities, rituals, anything Islamic. Of course, any book could be expanded to multiple volume, but I wanted something reasonably comprehensive at a reasonable price. This book does that. I actually started reading it from thebeginning. The author has a tendency-one I like-of rambling on and introducing other people or events into the discussion of whatever you are reading about. They threw in some color plates of some mosques, prayer rituals, and some other stuff, but otherwise it is devoid of drawings of any kind.Scholars will want to spend $700-2500 on multiple volume encyclopedias, but for the rest of us, this is fine."
2,Did they change the formula?,"I have used this shampoo for years and LOVED it...but this bottle seemed very different. The scent was very perfumey...it did not work into a rich lather at all...and left my hair feeling dry! So, either Bumble and Bumble changed their formula...OR ...I was scammed and this was NOT Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo. Very disappointed either way."
3,okay,"This is okay. I would not buy it again because for the price it did not make my hair feel any different than some other store brands. Smells great, but smell alone will not make me spend the money."
2,not impressed,I just bought this Gentle Shampoo and the Deeep Conditioner. Sadly I was not really impressed with either one. The shampoo didn't lather much and my hair ended up feeling not so clean. Absolutely not worth the hefty price tag. I'm going back to Pantene.
1,Too harsh,I bought this product after reading how great it was. It was the most I've ever paid for a hair product because the reviews were so impressive. It is so harsh I can't believe they recommend it for treated hair. My hair felt totally stripped and horribly rough.I will not buy this product again!
5,No Bumbling Around,"Bumble & Bumble Gentle Shampoo is the best for extremely sensitive scalps and skin. I am allergic to a common chemical that is in a lot of shampoos, even fancy salon formulas (it's quaternium or polyquaternium....check your bottle!!)because it makes shampoo foam like the commercials. Bumble and Bumble doesn't have this chemical in it, it doesn't have a cloying perfume smell, and it cleans your hair beautifully."
1,Not the real deal!,"I love Bumble & Bumble products just as much as I love Amazon.com and had yet to be disappointed by either, until now! This product does not smell like real B & B nor does it do the same thing to my hair. The 'labeling' had been worn off in several places, so perhaps it is really old or it is a different product in a B & B container. Regardless, as a devout Amazon.com customer, I am extremely disappointed..."
3,"great shampoo, not so great price","I have very damaged hair from hilights, and my hair is also super super fine. I decided to splurge on this shampoo & the super rich conditioner.Both of these products do a great job. They smell a bit like pantene. The shampoo foams up really nicely, and the conditioner really gets into your hair. This product does have a bit of greasy buildup -- you need to wash your hair a bit more frequently to keep the grease from looking really stringy.One thing you need to make sure you do is remove the buildup from the shampoo and conditioner. I use Neutrogena anti-buildup shampoo once a week, and it really does the trick. It's a bit difficult to find, but really amplifies the effects of this product.I probably won't buy this again -- tigi bedhead self absorbed shampoo/conditioner does pretty much the same thing for my hair, at slightly less of the price."
3,? knock off,"I have purchased this product from my salon and loved it every time. However, when I purchased it from Amazon this time, it did not work as well. It does not lather well and leaves my hair feeling stripped of moisture, not at all what you would expect from a ""gentle"" shampoo. Quite a disapointment."
1,Wrong Item Pictured,The scoreboard socket pictured is Cooper product number 732-3. The seller sent me sockets with Cooper product number 732. The 732 socket has a hook on the back and is not the snap-in type that is pictured on Amazon. The seller promptly refunded my money and told me to keep the sockets. Be careful however as the seller did not stock the 732-3 snap-in socket and I had to order them elsewhere. Either the seller or Amazon should correct the picture to avoid this issue in the future.
3,no kit to attach it,"There were no parts or pieces to attach it with, as described on the box. No instructions either. As far as I can tell, I'lll need to drill some holes in my hood to attach it. But, who knows? There weren't any instructions! I wouldn't recommend this as an easy to install accessory. I'd only recommend it to someone who has the time and tools to mess with it."
3,MORE DRUMS...,"Q and Not U are pretty much amazing, but the drums are mixed far too low on this album. As a band, they thrive on energy, and the frentic drums are a key ingredient in building that energy. The songs are good and original, and a blast live, but poor mixing proves deadly. Pick up Different Damage or the Book of Flags/X-Polynation single instead."
3,NO BASS PLAYER,"Although this is a fantastic band because of their ecletic creativity, being without a bassist is a tough transition to this Power album. I liked Kill No Beep Beep for its harmony of its guitars. Because they dont have a bassist in this album, the harmony is not as full as the first album. They do make a great attempt though as seen in ""Wonderful People."" They attempt to subsitute in a keyboard to compensate for no bassist, but it just doesnt quite make the cut for me."
2,ehhhh.,"dont get me wrong, i love q and not u. i love no kill beep beep, and different damage definitely has some great songs on it. i bought this cd because i thought it'd be like the others, and because i heard wonderful people and liked that. but i just cant get into this cd. i keep trying to give it that one good listen that will make me like it, but every time i put it in the cd player, i only take it out a few minutes later. if you want an awesome q and not u cd, i totally recommend no kill no beep beep over power."
1,"If you like dance music, then this is the album for you.","I was wholly disappointed in the direction that Q And Not U went with this album. In 2000, Q And Not U was a breath of fresh air where Indie rock had been quite stagnant in respect to unique music. ""No Kill No Beep Beep"" is probably one of the top albums of the 21st Century and ""Different Damage"" was is also a notable release. Power, on the other hand, is a poppy 80's influenced disaster. This is a very radio-friendly and marketable album, and would probably have been very successful if it had hit the mainstream (see trash like Panic! at the Disco). If you like the previous two albums; avoid this contrived drivel like the plague. Although, I admire the band for their experimentation with different instruments and layers, there is no excuse for the result. It is a good thing that this band broke up because if ""Power"" is any indication of where they were headed - they did everyone a favor."
2,Costs too much to be this crappy,The handle is really slick and hard to hold in my hand.The tip is over buffed and has no grip in a screw head.I am really sorry I bought so many of these.
2,Sleeping Beauty Ruminations,"Kaplan's work is clear and direct. However, his conception of nationalism and domestic violence is poorly developed and, quite possibly, misleading. In this work, as with his previous ones, Kaplan bases his expectations of the future on the faulty claims of nationalist groups who now prefer to find continuity in their conflicts. Nations and subcultures, it appears, are resurrected like Sleeping Beauty by the ""kiss of freedom"". If a group of people decide to adopt the trappings of a previously existing nation, say for instance Croatia, that does not mean that they were always part of an eternal Croatian nation. It means that nationalists are using history as a political tool. Kaplan apparently disagrees. But we are not privy to his thinking on the subject."
2,Self concious 'profundity',"Newt is correct about one thing, Kaplan quotes everyone one earth. That is part of his whole technique of sounding prophetic. I for one am not especially enamored of 'prophecy'. I would prefer some solid empirical reporting. Kaplan's last book had the same faults as this one, as a matter of fact, it reads like he cut and pasted alot from An Empire Wilderness, but this book isn't even that good. Which is saying something, cause I gave that one about a C-."
3,The world is not a Coming Anarchy. Still worth the read..,"This book started off well. Kaplan presented us with the current conflicts as well as culture changes and their effect on geographical borders. Beginning with West Africa, Kaplan has good first hand experiences to offer. I was impressed by all the travelling the man had done. Still, I found his views too extreme (but maybe that is what he was trying to do). I would not say the book isn't worth it. I would still recommend the book. Other key points; relates to other authors too much; no real flow; and too many statistics (e.g. Population Growth by 2025 which Kaplan bases arguments on)."
1,The Sky is Falling?,"As I'm sure many readers will agree, this book is indeed disturbing. What is most disturbing to me, however,is that a book based on narrow and limited research has become mandatory reading for US policy makers and diplomats. President Clinton proportedly has a copy of this on his bedside table.The issues that Kaplan addresses are broad and complex. More broad and complex than he presents them. We need to look at what scholars and local citizens have to say about the causes of and solutions to problems in communities. Unlike Kaplan, I don't believe the world is going to hell in a handbasket. I do think, however, that sometimes an uninformed, blanket response to global and national problems often exacerbates them. I also believe when we come to view an area as beyond hope (as Kaplan would have us believe), we are really just making it easier for ourselves to sleep at night when we abandon such an area, whether it be a Sierra Leone rainforest or a Chicago slum."
5,A World of Desperate people,"A realist in a naive world, Mr. Kaplan's book should wake up every naive person on this now very small planet to the fact that the have-nots are getting more and more desperate.Kaplan is able to get across his point with such great interest its hard to put down."
5,we are living it.......,...As a venezuelan I can tell you we are living this hell day after day...this book couldn't describe it better.... !!!!!!
1,Well written propaganda....,"This is not a ""good"" book. Spooked me in a different way than he intended. The ideology masked by Kaplan's claim to objectivity and realism balanced with a clever aversion to self-rightiousness, is just the kind of ego-centric dominator species reality view that is racing us toward oblivion. He speaks of ""natural resources"" rather than environment. What can I say? Give me faerie dust any day over this kind of cool-headed fascist approach to running the world...which, by the way is what his ilk is after. Henry K. for Heaven's sake......give me a break."
5,Interesting,"Kaplan successfully discusses the geo-political issues of a bi-polar world. The issue of how to deal with rogue states, and criminal, unelected, unaccountable rogue groups is also addressed. Kaplan has presented a number of concise, cogent methodologies to deal with these issues. And for the most part they are suitable and appropriate. I look forweard to reading his other works"
1,Can't see the forest for the trees,"Kaplan's Coming Anarchy is one of the weakest books I've read, and now in my 3rd year of a Pol Sci Phd program, that's a lot of books. He is the Jenny Jones of literature, spotlighting all that is shocking yet meaningless. This book is a collection of problems, yet he offers no theory of how all of these events are related, no theory behind this anarchy, and no explanation for where it is leading, except for a possibly racist suggestion that it is leading to a society like that in current-era West Africa. Interested readers should consider Robet Wright's Nonzero, in which he argues there is a progressive and equilibrium path in human development. Even in if you share Kaplan's argument that there is or going to be anarchy, he offers nothing in the way of a coherent argument."
4,"Couldn't put it down, read it twice, a little too bleak","This book was written in 1997 and I read it in 2003 and still found it worth reading -- twice. Kaplan is more than a journalist -- he's an important voice for realpolitik in for this century. Dissolution of the nation-state, blurring of the lines between terrorism and crime, and the wisdom of implementing democracy in environments without solid economic foundations are the three key takeaways for me. Kaplan can be a little too bleak in his outlook, however, and it's important to read this in the context of other political and technology books, lest you give up all hope, but I find his writing fascinating and his prose hard to put down. The fact that this is a collection of essays seemed immaterial to me as the threads were all connected and the points complementary."
4,A wonderful book,"It was a long search before I could find a book which gives me meanings of all the puristic Hindi terms like 'ABHILEKH', 'ADHIYUKT'. But after having found this I say it's a great book to improve your hindi vocabulary. I am benefitting from this.The thing it lacks is various number forms of a verb, i.e., 'Bahuvachan' usage of a verb. I think if the authors include that it will be complete in most of the senses."
5,Can trust the product,"I bought all my baby room ""walls of the wild"" decals despite some of the negative reviews I have read. I bought only a couple at first just to see how well it will stick to my unsmooth walls since the main suggestion for the decal was to use on smooth walls and our walls are not smooth at all. I was so happy to see how well the decals stuck to my walls. I was even able to place the larger decals by myself without any problems. Just follow the instructions and you will be fine."
2,not a good choice,I read the reviews and decided this sounded like a good phone. I have owned it only a couple of days and already I am having problems. The answering machine does not hang up once the caller has disconnected. The caller ID rarely works and the reception has been poor. I am returning this phone ASAP. I previously owned a Uniden that lasted me about 10yrs. This experience is definitely turning me back to Uniden.
2,bad reception,"We used to have a old GE 900 MHz phone, and the reception was WAY better than this 2.4GHz. We're in a tiny little condo, so the phone is never very far from the base, and the phone has constant static. The person on the other end can hear the static too. It is also kind of difficult to hear the other person, even with the volume turned up. And sometimes we even get piercing feedback -- ouch! I am going to return this phone if I still can, and probably get another GE phone."
5,Doo Wop at his best.,"Great album with Doo Wop from a very high level. Ofcourse with ""There's a moon out tonight"", but when you have listened to the other songs as well you realise that this was not even close to being their best song."
4,Great Doo Wop!,"The Capri's biggest hit, 'There's a moon out...' is without a doubt a classic example of rock and roll at it's most romantic, but there are also a fair few other great records on this fine CD. Sounding similar to their brothers in music, Randy and the Rainbows and The Tokens, I certainly recommend this to fans who belive Dion and the Belmonts were the only good white Doo Wop group from that time. A word of warning the 'Morse Code of Love CD was in fact recorded in the eighties and is not a collection of hits. A great Cd"
4,This game rocks.,"If you played Earth 2150, you should be able to pick this game up and play it right away. Almost disapointingly not much has changed from that game. This game is visually stunning with better graphics than C&C: Red Alert2, but not quite as action packed. You get to play all 3 factions which have about 10-13 missions for each faction. The one cool feature is you can build a tank, plane, or turret and put whatever weapon you want on the unit and there are plenty to chose from. The unfortunate thing about this game is it is too much like Earth 2150 and they didn't improve the graphics or the game play. I had a little trouble with the game getting choppy if you tried to zoom out too far (I have a P1000mhz, 64meg video card, 256meg rdram)that gets alittle annoying because you can't see much of the battle field. The music wasn't that great either.But it still a cool game with a lot of good battles and many hours of playing."
1,Don't waste your time,"The moon project looks very pretty. It uses this scheme to lure innocent gamers into what it a ponderous, confusing, and frustrating disaster of an RTS.The controls reverse everything you expect in an RTS, which leads to many misclicks and frustrations. On the tutorial, I accidentally skipped one instruction box, and I couldn't figure out how to make units.The game is dull. Extremely dull. Almost all the groundunits are some kind of truck or tank, and all look almost identical. To produce units at all, you need 4 different buildings and 2 different kinds of units. There's a unit designed for the sole purpose of lugging resource bricks from the Mining building to the Processing building. Everything takes about twice as long as it should to build, resulting in long periods of waiting.Conclusion: Don't waste your time. Take a look at the box, maybe page through the strategy guide, but don't even try to play the game."
2,"Disappointing, derivative series","Take one part Voltron, one part Robotech, and one part Evangelion. Mix them together, and then sift out any form of depth. Toss in some computer generated graphics and what you've made is Aquarion.This series had a lot of potential, but if you're even a moderate fan of anime, you've seen everything it has to offer. Teens that have never seen anything better are the only ones that will be able to tolerate this DVD set."
2,Go read iansomniac's review. He pretty much has it all covered,"My title pretty much says it all. Iansomniac said everything I came here to say, only more eloquently than I could hope to be. We joked while watching that the creators said ""Let's make a show! Here are all the ideas we have. We'll put them all together whether they go together or not."" I will admit that we never made it completely through the box set. Around the time we finished the 2nd disc, we lost the will to watch, lol. It was just too obnoxious watching them bicker and fight.It had so much potential but just didn't manage to live up to it."
2,Ho-hum,"I am a Shoji Kawamori fan and an adult swim geek, and admit that this was not as killah I'd wanted. Beautiful work that sure didn't rock me to continue.Extras on the third disc were, sorry to admit, no big deal.Overall, the same old same old: Teenaged mechs and ancient monsters that are back to rule the world, so the good kids suit up and... Wait, Did'nt Bill Murray do that in GHOSTBUSTERS?"
4,Great Super Robot Anime,"I've always been a sucker for post-apocalyptic tales. The Mad Max franchise was fun, and a good case in point of the world gone badly wrong. AQUARION starts out with this theme, brings in the fan-favorite idea of coming robot sections into a bigger, giant robot with different forms/functions, and layers in lots of action.Considerable thought has gone into the apocalyptic world as well. The Great Catastrophe brought about the end of the world, and brought back the Shadow Angels, a kind of vampiric winged race that sucks the life force out of the victims. It's creepy stuff with a great backstory and good visuals."
4,A Mech Anime I Can Like,"While the characters were a little difficult to like, the beginning and ending are a little muddled and chaotic and the story wasn't the best I've seen; the series managed to keep me entertained enough that I would watch the second season if it were released here. And really, with my track history with this genre I'd say that's pretty high praise. Recommended."
3,"Didn't enjoy this much, you may like it if you enjoy giant transforming robot stories.","Although I am not an anime fan I had once watched an anime series created by Shoji Kawamori which led me to order this set as Kawamori has also created this series. However, this was not at all interesting for me - very confusing story line and many characters but not one could hold my interest. Transforming robots are really not my cup of tea!Maybe it gets better towards the latter part of the series but I will never find out as I could not watch it past the first 3 episodes."
2,This is not your Jonny Quest,"Aquarion is not for the very young viewer, I equate this style to the mind of 11-13 year old boys and those who have been reared with this anime stuff. It is similar, or to my knowledge the same as Japanese Manga, or Magna, whatever they call it, with the big eyes. The episodes are not easy to understand, not well spoken, has confusing characters with adult themes. Dialogue consists of pettiness, biting, bratty, and again, for adults. Too many characters prove more confusion.Aquarion is military, science fiction, robotic, with overdone battle scenes and violent in nature. This, again is not for the youngsters. I sometimes doubt if even if kids under 10 would understand the hidden references in the dialogue. The packaging is attractive with its own slim DVD cases.Not for me or my imaginary grandchildren....Rizzo"
1,Aqua - what?,"My daughter and I planned to enjoy this anime series. Unfortunately, I fell asleep, and she was so confused and disgusted that she stopped watching. Why are people passing through walls? Why are there so many characters? Why do the characters go into some kind of sexual experience every time the do that Power Rangers unite to form a big robot thing? I really don't care, and I really don't want this thing in my DVD player again."
3,Feels very familiar,"In a nutshell: better than average animation, story that feels like 90% of animes you've seen before, great music by Yoko Kanno of Cowboy Bebop fame, serviceable subtitles and the promise of more seasons. Honestly feels a bit undercooked and not necessarily one I'd recommend."
2,Good only as a game,"This product is only good if you wish to play a game, but not if you realy want to get somehelp in picking numbers for a lottery. The discription given for this product is wrong as there is no way that it allows you to see what the results are from checking the results of the previous winning numbers. It is not worth the money to buy."
2,Disappointed in this one.,"i guess I didn't read the description carefully enough. The TV shows on this set are poor quality, and iI have no memory of them and i am OLD! They are very dated and not very enjoyable. The documentary is OK. At this low price I should be happy - but I am not."
1,Well....,"We all love Betty White. This DVD is mostly about ''Life with Elizabeth'' which I am not familiar with at all. I thought it would be a documentary about her life and her roles in ''The Mary Tyler Moore show'' and ',The Golden Girls'' etc.... sorry."
3,Betty still beats the competition.,"Its's fun to see a review of Betty White's long career, seeing her hint-of-mischief eyes and beguiling dimples. A person my age also just enjoys reminders of the ol' black-and-white low-pixel-count screens of childhood. Betty is a good match for Lucy in that respect, with typical lines and situations popular in early sitcoms. Her wit is evident in the mid-years, and even today, she's the wry star of whatever scene of interview she's in. What a career! What a life! Quiz shows included in the fun. My enjoyment didn't last through too many old bits of early stuff, slightly discouraging me from inserting the next disc after the first. But skimming along works fine. I had an overall wish that the whole presentation had been ""tightened"" up in a documentary style, especially the eary stuff."
3,thought provoking but lacking,"This book provides some insights and suggestions for dealing with change. Although there are some good tips for dealing with change, the author does not present it in a elegant manner. This book is filled with stories of people that the reader does not know and I suppose should be able to relate to. In addition, the author uses a number of quotes from other people. What would have made this book more successful would be an honest, personal, first-person teaching of the knowledge that I think the author has to offer. I found this book difficult to finish reading as it did not draw me in."
2,Poorly Organized,Mr. Das (aka Jeff) seems to enjoy dragging the reader through as much suffering as he can recall. That appears to be his main point. The text is scattered with no logical order.Frank Hazelwood
1,There are better books on the Iron Lady,"A breezy look at the rise to power and years in office of Maragret Thatcher, Maddox sees fit to devote an entire chapter to the Prime Minister's beauty and wardrobe regimen. This, for someone who gave us, for better or worse, and entire school of public policy named after herself, ""Thatcherism.""In my opinion, this book is ""Chick-lit,"" masquerading as biography. Give it a pass; there are better books on the Iron Lady, including a major new biography due out this winter."
3,Nice watch,A nice watch with a bad system for the band. Each time I want to take it off it becomes a problem. The rest is very nice for the price I paid.
4,Excellent one,I've been using this watch for more than 6 months now. Its really a nice affordable swiss watch.
4,Tissot dynamic range,"Both the appeareance and the functions are satisfying. Price is also; compatible with the similar range. One could consider PRS 516 the ""classic"" of the sports watches."
3,Definatly Diffrent,"With the death of Nick, Link 80 has moved in a diffrent direction musicly. Their new sound is far more hardcore, and even has a dash of evil-core in it. The new singer is a screamer, as oposed to Nick, who was extreamly vocaly talented. If you are really into Link 80, or enjoy harder sounds than 17 reasons, this ones for you... If you are looking for more vocal gymnastics, you might want to look elsewhere"
2,The stuggle continues...,"Maybe it should stop cause... it isn't that good man! I won't lie the only reason I like Link 80 was cuase of Nick I can't back this or any band that sounds like it becuase Nick wouldn't be in it (cuase uh he can't obviously). Anyways I hate the bonus track at the end of this where they cover (well I guess you can't cover your own song, but it's so bad it sounds like it) No Way Out. Man do I love that song and these guys ruin it, THEY RUIN THEIR OWN SONG! How could I possibly listen to this, I'm sorry I love(d) Link 80 but I just... oh well I don't think it matters ALL that much either way the band is on ""haitus"" (read broken up) and the cd is just old and the band is old and I doubt anybody who is new to music will be looking at this without knowing what it already is, you wanted my two cents (you didn't? No I think you did, don't lie!)? BOW there it is homieeeeeeeeeee"
3,How can you think the new vocalist is good?,"I've been a fan of Link 80 ever since they got big, and I can't believe so many people are giving this album the ratings they are. It's a good album, no doubt, but there are certain things about it that really bring it down in quality from Link 80's previous ones. First of all, the new vocalist is horrible and I think he is part of the reason that the band has receded in quality. He is never in any key, so his voice just sticks out over everything else. I love the horns though, in fact I give props to Aaron who has obviously matured greatly in his trumpet playing ability. Most of the songs are decent, some are great, and some stink. So take your chance if you're on the bubble of buying this album. You'll probably end up somewhere in the middle like I did, especially if you own 17 reasons and are accustomed to Nick."
5,"Newer Link 80 without Nick, but still incredible","This is a great album. I do favor 17 Reasons more, but without Nicks singing I think this album still delivers. Great horn lines, fast drumming, furious guitar riffs... its basically the Link 80 I've always known and loved, just a new singer. It was great to hear a new version of Nowhere Fast, too. If you're a Link 80 fan or a fan of ska-core of ska-punk in gerneral, pick this up, along with 17 Reasons, you wont regret it. My favorites include Addiction, Intolerance, My Girl, Evil Twin, and Resist in G Minor."
4,Good Punk Rock With Horns,"Don't let any sentiments for the previous singer stray you away from this CD. The singer (who had gotten much criticism for ""pretending to be the former singer"", not sounding like the last singer, etc. etc.) in my opinion is quite good when comparing the old group to the new one. The only downfall (if you want to call it that) that I can see is that he can't scream at all, but the band does plenty of that to cover for him so it's all good. This band was never strong on musicianship back in the day but made up for it with strong songwriting. This disc boasts some tight musicanship, some tight songwriting and the lyrics are top notch. Check out ""Past Tense"" and ""Time For Change"". Definatly my favorite Link 80 tracks."
4,Hell Girl: Puddle,"After v.1 set up the general idea of what a ""Hell Girl"" is, v.2 begins to flesh out the characters more and seems to begin a storyline that goes beyond compartmentalized episodes.Theres also one episode thats really different and i wont spoil it.As with v.1 HG is really animated art, and the enclosed art cards are again really nice. While Ive not done it yet, I intended to look up the Memorial listed in the credits to check out more Japanese art of the period."
5,There's more to Hell Girl then meets the Eye.....,"I really wasn't sure how vol. 2 would play out. I mean vol. 1 was worth every penny the artwork is beautiful and every story is different and interesting, but come on......How can these episodes continue? Someone is always wronged and vengeance is a dish best served cold. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Boy, was I completely wrong! I will have to agree with the first review on this volume. You are taken just alittle deeper into the character of Hell Girl. Curious, she doesn't seem like such souless creature, maybe once human...hmmmmm. I really can't wait for vol. 3, 4, 5, etc, you get the idea."
5,Awesome Achievement!!!,"My favorite Renaissance album. This is the album where they found their identity for years to come. If you enjoy King, Crimson, Yes, Moody Blues, and ELP - You should enjoy this album tremendously."
4,Confused?,"I love it, my wife hates it. Go figure. Renaissance is a required taste. She doesn't like Annie's voice. can't figure that one out. She has a powerful voice with great range."
3,elegant folk-prog,"Undeniably rich and ornate album, unapologetic in its reach and grandeur. Renaissance hit one of their high points here. Annie Haslam's vocals are right on the mark, the songs are melodic and memorable, and the instrumentation is complex without being obscure. Piano and organ dominate, and classical structures abound.People with a low tolerance for symphonic prog rock and long songs are advised to stay away. But for those who have a secret craving for the days in the early 1970s when bands were trying their best to turn away from being pop hit machines and create something better, this is a fountain of beauty and grace.""Pretentious""? Yes. Everything that the punk rock revolution of the late 70's was trying to overturn? Yes. Fantastically beautiful and worth hearing again and again? Yes indeed."
3,"Burned out on ""Ashes"" and Renaissance?","I was happy to see that the music from Renaissance is still being printed. I was a fan of the band when this album came out, saw them once in concert, and loved the haunting melodies, vocals, and bass lines. Listening to the album now, however, it definitely sounds dated and somewhat predictable. Haslam's voice is still wonderful to listen to and the title track is the best. I would probably recommend Novella over this work if you wanted to purchase only one album."
3,very informative but dull reading,Difficult reading for those who like their sources information brief and to the point. Comprehensively overcovers the small arms used by both sides. Too many words to cover too little information. Valuable in that it has a section on those arms unique to the south including the Morse carbine.
4,Nostalgia,"I read this book in junior high. I didn't really understand it then, but now as an adult, I have a chance to read it again. I am so happy I've been able to find it again via Amazon Marketplace."
1,NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!! THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY!!!,I emailed this seller several times and never got any reply back. I payed right away and never received any DVD's. No communication whatsoever. This seller will take your money and would never recommend them to anyone. NEVER BUY FROM THIS PERSON.
1,Great Western,"This is a great western on the scale of L'amour.John Reese was a personal friend while I was growing up and I love his books, they are great for all ages."
2,"OMG, the bits are terrible","The system sounded very convenient. I was willing to deal with not-so-stable drilling. I'm not that picky - I have really used only one other ""regular"" (non quick change) set of drill bits. You can just forget drilling any wood harder than balsa. You can lean into these junkers, doesn't matter what you do with torque or speed, they just never go in. Change to one of my ""regular"" bits - it's like night and day. You wouldn't believe it if you didn't try it. The bits must be made of the softest, cheapest metal anywhere. I wonder if they were even sharp to begin with. Forget it, spend the money, buy a good brand, buy the accessories separately. This set is cheap, not a good deal. Stay away.The quick change stuff wobbles a lot, I guess one would expect that. It's workable, not ideal."
2,Drill Bits Not So Hot,"The drivers and accessories are fine, but the drill bits are out of round and of very poor quality. Expected much more from Dewalt."
3,good for the driver bits,"This is my second Dewalt quick bit set and I still like it, the drill bits break fairly easily but the driver bits are strong and working in theatre where I change bits frequently it is a must have time saver"
2,"All old songs, nothing new here. Many mixes are Terrible.","Absolutely nothing new here for those that already have Ultra Dance series CD's. Also, many of the mixes are terrible, so the versions of these songs are likely not as good as the copies you already have. I hope I bought this used since both CD's are complete coasters..."
2,Ultra 10 cd review,"I do not think this is a very cool cd. I found myself skipping through song after song, in hopes of finding one that I liked. A few good classics are on this cd, but I dont recommend buying this cd."
2,Better than nothing,"This is really a cell phone holder. You can squeeze an Ipod in it, but it's a tight fit. They should make the opening a 1/2 inch wider and it would be a perfect fit. Okay if you don't want your Ipod on your passager seat."
1,A Disappointing Book,"This book, written by a journalist who has made a career out of writing World War II adventures, is neither about the race to the Moon nor the U.S. rivalry with the U.S.S.R. The majority of it is, instead, about the World War II efforts of the German rocket team under Wernher von Braun at Peenemunde, its wartime exploits, its surrender to American forces in 1945, and only tangentially about its post-war activities in the United States. Only 6 of 24 chapters actually deal with Project Apollo, and none of the book goes beyond the popular literature on either the Germans or Apollo. Your time would be better used reading any number of other books on Apollo, especially ""...the Heavens and the Earth: A Political History of the Space Age,"" by Walter A. McDougall, which received the Pulitzer Prize for History."
2,GO TO THE DISNEY STORE INSTEAD!!!!!!! I WAS RIPPED OFF!!!!!!!!!,"I paid $20 plus about $8 shipping for this cheap old looking toy that came in a box that looked like it had been sitting around for years. I wouldn't even care about the box if the toy was at least worth $20, but it is not. It looks A LOT better in the picture than in person. The Disney store has a wide array of PR toys w/ multiple characters in one box for the price I paid for this one. I will be sure to NEVER buy from this vender again."
1,A Joke! I have never seen a bootleg original.,"Don't rent/buy or think about it. Straight jack move. Putting out garbage just to make money on first time renters. Started off with an ok plot but the acting was awful. kids looking into the camera, DJ with two turn tables and I did not hear one beat-and people dancing. It looked like the whole thing was put together and wrapped up at the end so they could hurry and get it to the video store to get my money on a whim that I would give it a chance. I feel hustled out of my 3.99 at the video store. It has been five years since I gave an independent black film a chance and it's time to set the clock again. I chuckled every now and then with my mouth open in disbelief saying ""I don't believe this"". My wife who doesn't speak English yelled out ""El Cheapo"". Believume - trust me on this! Pass up on it playboy!"
5,"17 month old Pip thinks this is the best ""Find it"" book.","This book is very good because I get to point, clap and meow a lot. My grandma always laughs and acts surprised when I find the kitten, but I don't know why, because it really wasn't so very hard after the first time. Since there aren't any words, we get to talk about the cute pictures. I call the cat Edgar because that is my cat's name. We had so much fun Grandma bought me four more books in the series. I like them, but this one still is the one I like the best."
1,Yawn...pretentious product,"This is a poorly executed, tedious DVD. Didn't draw me in and help in any way. I want a DVD that constantly calls me back to explore and develop my yoga. This is not it!"
3,"riven, where are you","After having played Myst and Riven (although in reverse order), I was very excited about Myst III, only to be very disappointed.Yes, like Hollywood films, the effects are great and the graphics are well rendered, but the story was lacking. What I loved about Riven was that the puzzles had a global importance which was well integrated into the story. There was a clear separation between the cold, scientific creations of Gehn and the more mystical, organic ones of the rebels, and yet the two intertwined beautifully throughout the game.Unfortunately with Myst III, the puzzles are isolated and seem incidental to any story. The puzzles themselves are not very challenging and you don't have to look very far or think very hard for clues (maybe some people consider this a plus).I did really enjoy the graphics and the 360 degree panning was perfect. Now if only they would marry the technical excellence of Myst III with the well-crafted storyline of Riven!"
5,Exile,"This game is best in graphics compared to the first two though Riven is very close. Though it is difficult at first you get the idea of what you are suppose to be doing like the other Myst games. In this world you can look at things in diferent directions such as up, down, and left or right. The plot isnt as good as the other Myst games, but that isnt why your playing it anyway. it is much more fun to look at the graphics and scenery and all the neat puzzles."
1,Save your dough,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed both Myst and Riven, Exile has been a monumental disappointment. Myst and Riven set the bar much too high and Exile simply pales in comparison. From a technical perspective I found the constant interchanging of the four CD-ROMs extraordinarily obnoxious, which detracted from the game play. The puzzles were challenging, but navigating the landscapes and solving the puzzles often required good fortune, not skill. Additionally, the soundtrack did not boast the same mesmerizing power of its predecessors, which detracted from any ability to create ambience throughout the surrealistic ages. A highlight was the ability to view your surroundings in a 360-degree nature, which has been a major improvement over Myst and Riven. However, this was not enough of an upgrade that warrants a recommendation. Save your dough or wait until you can purchase the software from an auction site for pennies on the dollar."
4,Slightly (only slightly) disappointing.,"OK, the graphics are absolutely stunning, but that they were already in Riven. The only real apparent technical progress (and not the least, mind you) is the 360 degree view, which lets you immerse into the breathtaking sceneries of six (or more acurately, five and a half) different ages.The puzzles are in the same logical vein as usual, but sadly I didn't find them very challenging and I was able to finish the game in approximately 12 hours, which is much less than what I was expecting from the creators of the Myst series.As a whole, Exile is a wonderful game, mysterious and beautiful, and the music sends you directly into another, totally magical dimension, but if you've already played its prequels, no doubt you'll be left begging for more. My guess is that people with less experience in the Myst universe will enjoy it much more. I can only recommend they play Myst and Riven (in this order) too."
1,I wish they'd fix it.,"I wish i could say I was satisifed with this product, but I advise those of you that run HP computers, or any computer with an intel chipset to wait, because there is still a large bug problem with it. I'm sure the game will be very much worth waiting for, once they fix it, but even the company isn't sure when they'll get it fixed, they keep pushing the date back. So I don't say ""Don't buy it"" I say, wait till they get the patches out. . .and then buy it unless you're sure it'll run on your system."
3,Myst exile opinon from middle aged player,"This is by far a more difficult game than the other ""Mysts"". It doesn't compare to Riven, being my fav of all the others. Nice try on the part of the developers."
5,It rocks!,"This is the COOLEST game in the whole wide world. ...this game deserves 10 stars. Go buy it, it's awsome."
2,Myst:: Exile to the world of nausea,"I had only been playing the game for a few minutes when I got dizzy and had to stand over the toilet until the feeling of nausea left and I stopped feeling like I was going to blow my lunch out of this world. I played Myst and I thought it was really good. I tryed to play Riven but I coudn't get it to start, so i skipped ahead to Myst Exile. The way your cursor moves in the game sort of gives you the illusion that the screen is concave and the way you move about made me get motion sickness and i am fine on roller coasters. Though my stomach couldn't take it i will admit that the graphics are pretty good and plot line made sense and the concept of going to the other worlds is pretty cool. If you think you can stand it then i would recomend it."
2,Completely Uninspired,"Had they started with this installment, the Myst series never would have gotten off the ground. While the 360 free-look engine is really nice, it is absolutely the only thing to recommend this game. The first episode was simply a revelation. Riven gave us an incredible integration of narrative and truly environmental puzzles. Exile adds nothing but the latest technology. It's a poor imitation made without vision or inspiration."
1,Doesn't work with Mac,"I loved MIST & RIVEN and couldn't get MYST III fast enough. After years in the software business I should have known better than to purchase version 1.0. If you have a MAC, I suggest you wait several months, years? until Ubisoft corrects all of their problems. For now, I am stuck with a game that is unplayable due to visable grid lines, very jumpy mouse control and choppy speech. Ubisoft answered my email saying that they will get back to me in 24 hours. That was 10 days ago and I am still waiting. I hope ... will return my money."
4,"Not a true ""Myst"" game","Myst and Riven were truly one-of-a-kind. They had great storylines, great puzzles, and so much emotional impact that they left me awestruck after I finished them. Myst III, however, while it has clever puzzles and a good story, has very little of the surreal emotional qualities that the two previous games carried. Nevertheless, I got to know the characters, and I left the game satisfied. Overall, it is well made and worth playing, hence my four-star rating."
1,Trouble - won't run!,"Purchased Myst Exile in May - installed immediately but when tried to play, it resulted in a ""dump"". Wrote Ubisoft - now 4 times and unable to obtain ANY support.The only thing I get is:Your question has been received. You should expect a response from us as soon as possible (usually within 72 hours).After 4 months I don't believe the 72 hours any more.Gave 1 star - but I don't feel I'm able to rate the program at all - it just doesn't work!"
4,Liked it!,"Adventure gamers seem to be divided into those who love MYST and those who hate it. I'm one of the former; MYST was what got me hooked on adventure games in the first place.That being said, I was really looking forward to Exile for about a year before it came out and I got it as soon as I could. And I liked it. It was just as absorbing as MYST and Riven, the ages were beautiful, and the music was great. I love the concept, and the interface is easy to understand and use.I had some problems getting the game to run, however. The movies never did run smoothly, and a lot of the audio was messed up. I understand there's a patch for this now, however.I also found the puzzles extremely easy, so the game didn't last very long! However, even though they were easy, the puzzles were more than just the ""apply inventory item X to slot Q"" variety, which I find tedious. You really do have to think, and think in unaccustomed ways, to get through them.A good addition to the series!"
1,Very buggy - many having problems - support non-existent,I purchased this program several weeks ago (preordered it actually) and it will not work on my computer. On the online game forums there are many people complaining about the same problem. And there is little or no response from tech support. I would not reccomend this game to anyone until they work the bugs out (if ever)
1,MYST 3 EXILE DON'T WORK,THIS GAME DOES NOT OPERATE THE WAY THE USERS MANUAL SAYS. IT HAS MORE PATCHES THAN MY PANTS. THEY CANNOT FIX MY PROBLEM WHICH DOES NOT LET YOU SAVE GAMES THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO. PLAYED MYST 1 AND RIVEN WITH NO PROBLEM.
3,It's coming!,"I think that all M/R/E fans are staring at the clock, wondering why it seems to be moving backwards. I've been a fan since the original MYST and I am really excited. This will be TOTALLY AWESOME! In the words of m01ety, ""BRING IT ON!"""
2,More of the same...not real-time walkthrough!,"Although I'm not very far into the game yet I'm really disappointed that it is still a point and click movement instead of allowing real movement like Half-Life. See the stairway, click on the stairway, disolve to standing at foot of stairway, click higher on stairway, dissolve to halfway up up stairway... you get the idea.Puzzles I've encountered so far are VERY similar to those in earlier games, but that's pretty much the part I love. Enjoy"
3,Myst 3: Exile,"Just bought it but haven't played it yet. toured through the first part. Its just like all the other Myst games; a puzzle game looking for clues. Not a shootem up game, but never expected to be so. The scenes are well done. Too bad they never made more of these with modern graphics."
4,"Not as good as Riven, but still an A+ game","OK, I thought Riven was better designed, but this is still an excellent first attempt by UbiSoft. My major complaints were: 1. The greenhouse in Jnanin looks fake. 2. The birds in Edanna look fake. In fact, all of the animals could have been done much better (see Riven) 3. Some of the insight behind what is happening is lacking. For example, a. How did Saavedro reset the Edanna age (especially the collapsing log)? How is anyone supposed to know the biology behind the whole insect/bird/fruit cage incident in Edanna without actually reading the strategy guide? It is easy enough to finish Edanna, but knowing why certain things happen the way they do is confusing. Riven was much better in this respect. Overall, Edanna was the weakest age, and there are a few other moments similar to this in other ages. But, these few drawbacks do not detract too much from the general beauty of the game. I definitely rate this at the top of all of the games I have played."
1,Exiled!!!!!,Check this out: Pentium 3 and over 800 MHZ and the program won't load. I come up with a M3EXE and MSS32.DLL and the game didn't even load properly. Disappointed!!!!!
3,too easy,"Compared to Riven, EXILE was simple. Maybe the authors wanted to ease up after stumping the world with Riven's super hard puzzles. Answers in EXILE required searching rather than logic.The key was in finding things rather than figuring things out. But we liked the crazy guy. He made us laugh. He was nuts and had a permanent bad hair day. May he rot forever."
4,Continues the tradition,"Blowing away the previous competition with it's eye popping slendor, Myst 3 continues the proud tradition of combining the beauty, grace, and mystery Myst has become synonomus with into a new experience...Yes, the format is the same, and the story does feel lacking at times, but so does all myst stories at times, being essentially a story that unfolds to the player in his or her own way..One thing the new developers should have concentrated more on was the sense of history and intruige that initially sucked in most of the players, this game compensates too much of that for simply a gorgeous looking game through and through.."
3,disappointing,"I liked ""Myst,"" absolutely loved ""Riven"" but was disappointed with ""Exile."" Partly it was the graphics, I often ended up clicking all over the screen because it was difficult to find things. I liked the puzzles well enough, especially the magnetic world, but I did find the plant world tedious and the last world a let-down; the game ends very abruptly, I wanted to go off to those other islands.This game isn't as challenging as ""Riven"" and it isn't as exciting as ""Myst."" Still, if you like the series, you'll probably want to buy this one. Fwiw, my husband liked it more than I did."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I wasn't going to bother writing a review, until I read another review stating that if the game doesn't work it's because I'm too computer-illiterate or I have a cheap system!! My computer meets, and in face, exceeds the requirements listed on the box, and yet the game will not run properly. I managed to return it to the store after producing emails from the publisher stating that they are aware that more testing needed to be done, they know there are lots of bugs, yet they don't know if it can or will be fixed at any time in the near future. If the game runs on your system great, but it's a gamble. Check out the tech support forum on the myst 3 official site before you spend your money. And yes, it does deserve to have its ratings lowered, it should not have been released in its current state."
3,::shakes head::,No...no... This game....its not the same. The graphics quality is much worse. Much much worse. Its definetely not as clear as lets say riven. Remember they changed makers! Its presto now. (they made journeyman project) The game still is good but I just dont think it matches up with the original mysts. Dont listen to me though. Play it yourself and see. You might like it.
5,Great game game! Great puzzles!,"I just got Myst 3 Exile for Christmas, and I've beaten it! No hints either! Yes, it does have hard puzzles but if you got more then one person playing you can solve them. I recommend playing this game with a friend. You know what they say, Two Heads are better then one!I've beat the first Myst and this one Myst 3 Exile. Makes me thinking about taking on Riven next."
2,Drudgery,"I have Myst, Riven and had to buy this too. I enjoyed the previous games, once the puzzles are solved and games are saved. I enjoyed the refreshing graphics in Riven and they are better in this game...BUT jeez, what is with these puzzles...how about some game play???...If your in the hospital for a long stay you may want this on your laptop...ez"
3,A disappointment,"This game was not nearly as good as Myst and Riven. The developers haven't done anything new here so the game was pretty easy to solve. The story line is old and the puzzles are no longer innovative. Bring us something new guys! If you are a fan of the other 2 Myst games, you won't miss anything by skipping this one."
3,"A Fun Sequel to the Myst Saga, but so far Riven is better","The best part of the game is the beginning sequence, because it quickly draws you into the game world. You're greeted by Atrus--by now you two are old buddies. As he's about to show you a new age he wrote, an unexpected visitor arrives...and you find yourself once again ""exiled"" in a strange new world. However, once you stay in that world for a while, it begins to feel a bit stagnant. Though the puzzles are perhaps more challenging than Riven (the prequel), it does not always make sense how they fit into the gameworld. Riven's puzzles were an integral part of the plot, and you could feel the villanous Gehn's presence wherever you went--you were always looking over your shoulder. The graphics are excellent,however I think I've been spoiled by the realtime 3D graphics of RealMyst, and would like to see more of that. All in all, it's still a fun game, but if you're new to the Myst world, play Riven first."
4,Kept me enthralled for hours,"I'd played both Myst and Riven and was astonded by the time and energy people put into creating those amazing games. I heard Myst 3 was out and decided to retry my wits with the first two.Myst 3 is amazing. The 360 degree view and cool surroundings made me feel as if I was there. The puzzles were a challenge but not to the point where you needed to go back and forth between ages to find clues. Most everything you needed was in the same age with you which brought back memories of the first Myst game.My gripe about the game is that a patch is required in order to play. This venture was time consuming and annoying when you're ready to play. It's also quite ""buggy."" The game would crash to desk top for no reason and it was almost impossible to close it without restarting my computer.Overall, the game, continues the intrigue and fun that made the first two games so popular."
5,Excellent Game,"Although the game is not nearly as detailed and dramatic as Riven, many non-MYST fans will get excited about the series through this game. The puzzles are slightly simplier and the graphics are simply beautiful!"
4,Fun and entertaining - even though I cheated.,"I'm one of those gamers that has the walk-through handy. I play as much for the graphics, sounds and effects as anything, so don't mind the ""follow the leader"" approach sometimes. That said, this 3rd installment in the series is great. Superior graphics, several different endings (I think I counted 5), and one seriously demented, annoying character that taunts throughout the game, from world to world, room to room, and so on. Gets to the point where I wanted to shove one of the linking books down his throat. Alas, that was not an option.The worlds were really great. Least favorite: the jungle/nature one. The coolest: Energy - lot's of toys. My girlfreind like the jungle (pretty flowers and cute animals...) - gimmie the giant turbo and anti-gravity anyday.You'll enjoy it. Get a walk-through and see the different endings - it's worth it."
1,Mis-lead,I bought this game a month ago. I have not played it yet because I checked the system requirements on the box and it said that an 8 m video card was optional. It now seems that is very misleading. I intended to play on my laptop because I really like this type of game. My laptop is not old yet it seems it does not have the hardware required to run this game. I will be returning the game to where I bought it. I am very disappointed.
1,Incomplete program. Bugs Galore!,Don't purchase it yet. I'm sure it will be great if and when they eventually get a patch/fix out for it. But right now It's only running on about 25% of the systems for which it is purchased.
2,"No better than Riven, alas.","The original Myst was a phenomenon, and deservedly so. A visually beautiful adventure that depended on intellect rather than reflex. Most importantly, _mere mortals_ could, with patience and exploration, solve all of the puzzles without resort to any hint book.However, Riven was a different story. I'm certain a few people out there managed to navigate Riven without reference to any outside source...the 99.9th percentile of purchasers,those with infinite time and infinite patience, in my uninformed guess. Unlike Riven, I completed Myst without outside reference. With Riven, OTOH, I was eventually baffled without outside help. And so it is with Myst III.The heck with it. I'm sticking with Solitaire from now on."
1,Wait now or wait later...,"Well, I consider a factory-configured Micron 667 running Windows 98 to be a ""normal"" computer. Myst III locks it up every time! Their website tells me they are aware of the problem and are working on it. If they can tell us that on the day the game was released, why didn't they FIX THE GAME before they released it? Myst I was a model of stability. Seven years and a thousand games later, this is ridiculous!"
1,Does not work with Windows2000,This site currently tells you that you need a 333mhz machine and that you can use Windows2000. The box says that you need a 233mhz machine and Windows 2000 is not shown as a compatible OS. This is sad for me because I purchased the software and it runs extremly slow on my 400mhz machine Windows 2000 machine with graphics board. Also I was not impressed with the water graphics that were suppose to run well with my graphics card.
4,MYST III-LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT,"Its been a long time since I met with Atrus again. I was really excited to get my hands on MYST 3. The only problem is waiting for a patch so I can play the game. If you go to the Myst 3 website, you will see the patches available to you. Either 1.1 or 1.2. I had to download 1.2 and play in software mode. The software mode didnt run slow at all. It was beautiful and smooth. The graphics were outstanding and fun~not only to watch but to actually be a part of. The sounds were crisp and realistic and the Villian..Wow, what a nut case. Because I played Myst and Riven, working my way around the worlds was almost familiar, but not so to where I could solve the puzzles too easily. I was glad to be back. And...so glad I was patient enough to download the patch. It is well worth it and a perfect addition to my top Adventure PC Games. I wish it didnt end. I will miss it...just may play it again. Hope there is a fourth. Anyone know???"
5,Time well spent!!,"Exile was an exceptionally good game, having awesome graphics, a beautiful soundtrack, and challenging but not impossible puzzles. Having played both Myst and Riven several times, I really looked forward to Myst3, and was not at all disappointed. I have a new computer with Windows XP and Quicktime and have just recently used it to play the original Myst (1993), RealMyst (2000) and Riven (1997) using the CD Rom drive, and Myst3:Exile (2001) using the DVD drive, and had no trouble at all. For comparison, the only game I have played to rival Myst3:Exile's graphics was RealMyst; and the only game I've played to compare to Exile's puzzles was Schizm (though at times, Schizm was impossibly difficult and I had to cheat a bit to complete it). Exile requires patience, thoughtfulness, and persistence but is well worth the effort."
4,A worthy successor,"Did you ever wonder what happened to the worlds Sirrus and Achenar destroyed? Now's your chance to find out. A fine game, and a good continuation of the series by different people. Expect the same kind of puzzles, worlds, and solutions, but with a better interface and some excellent writing and acting. Not nearly as difficult as either Myst or Riven, but that's not necessarily a bad thing."
2,Stunning Myst Scenery with terrible plotline and unsatisfying ending,"I'm a big fan of the Myst/Riven/Uru serries, but in myst 3 they tried to add an in-depth plotline with characters you couldn't interact with. The point is the characters and plot they added made the game seem korny. And Exile was painfully shrot. I think there were only three or four worlds. The game ended and I sat there wondering if I skipped something, I didn't. Out of all of them, Riven has been my favorite. It's a beast though, like 7 disks or something. Anyway, I didn't care for what they did with exile, and the reward for solving stuff wasn't that great either. I wanted to scream durring the bounce-the-sunlight-off-the-flowers puzzle!!! Myst V better not be the last installment, cause it was pretty lame too. The serries is great though."
4,"Not a ""Myst""-ifying as the First Two","If you like this type of game, and you enjoyed Myst and Riven, the sequel ""Exile"" just might be worth it. The graphics are just as beautiful in places; the ""villain"" is mesmerizing. I like the new way of 360' rotation that has been brilliantly integrated into gameplay. Unfortunately, the new creators are worse writers than the originals and even worse puzzle creators. I actually solved one puzzle by accident, which would never have happened with the two original Myst games. I suggest you buy it only if you are a true Myst fan, but don't be too disappointed if it doesn't live up to the previous two games."
3,Exile: Holy Cow,"Wow. The graphics on this game were absolutely stunning. Just incredible and jaw dropping.However, the game left the factory in piss-poor condition. It is so chocked full of bugs and glitches that I am surprised that I was one of the lucky few able to complete the entire game without a crash or a lockup or it booting me to the desktop.As with most sequels, most Myst-philes will probably enjoy the game, but a few will deride it to appear fasionable. ""The puzzles aren't as hard as the original Myst, etc."""
4,Myst Exile is second best,"The original Myst is still the best game, by far. In Myst III the first island, steam/waterwheel island and the ice ball island were all easy to navigate and contained logical puzzles to solve as well as the final island. The rotted tree island was terrible for me and no fun. It was very hard to navigate and I needed a walkthrough, not just hints, to solve and even after completing that island I did not understand the logic of what had to be done. Myst was the best and I have played it about every 3 years. Riven was the least enjoyable and Myst III is in between. PS: I see that some PC users had troubles. I had no serious problems using an Imac except sound breakup occasionally and a crash at the end when the bad guy goes away in his gondola."
1,Myst 3 has bugs that will not allow us to play it,"We purchased Myst 3 [...] and so far have not been able to play it due to bugs in this version. It seems that it is not comptable with older video cards. Although we run a AMD-200 with a Fusion 16 Meg card, the program crashes and leaves us with an S3 video message. Checking with UBI Soft, they seem to be aware of this bug but have not written a patch yet. Thus, this game gets 1 star for failing to even load correctly and we are out [money] for purchasing a pre-order copy."
1,Check for patches before purchasing,"I strongly suggest waiting until UbiSoft releases more patches. I recently purchased this game and still cannot run it. This game will not run with Intel chipsets, it will not run with a number of 3D cards. According to people that have been able to play the game, there are numerous other bugs in this game as well. I am looking forward to playing this game. The people that haven't experienced problems say that it is fantastic -- what I would expect from the Myst series. However, I recommend waiting to purchase until patches are released that address the most horrendous bugs. The following urls are good places to look for information."
4,Worked well with my Windows XP!,"I've always been a fan of the MYST genre of games and by no means an expert. I guess with my limited computer knowledge, I somehow got Myst Exile to work beautifully on my Windows XP system and it runs at only 500 MHz (so it's old...but it works!)I just loaded the game and the patches before doing anything and had a blast! Myst 3 is good fun for the patient gamer and for those who know that problem solving improves thinking. I can see how the influence of the Journeyman series influenced this game. It reminded me of the Journeyman III game, which I enjoyed a few years back."
1,Myst III Exile v1.0 is BUGGY!,"We had Myst III Exile on our wish list for months. When it arrived, it failed to run on ALL THREE computers in our house.If you have an Intel Chipset, you will need a (currently unavailable) patch. If you have a NeoMagic chipset, you will need a (currently unavailable) patch. If you have Windows 2000, you are out of luck. Windows 2000 is not supported."
3,Great game over too quickly,"It took us just over 12 hours to finish the game. We were really hoping for 30-40 hours, based on Myst and Riven.The 360 degree 3D really is impressive, but (in my opinion) makes the game a bit dizzying at times, since the screen is virtually _always_ moving.The graphics were beautiful, especially the Edanna world, which has to be the most interesting level I've ever played in any game.All in all, it was a great experience... just wish it wasn't over so soon. (By way of comparison, N64's Banjo Tooie took us over 50 hours!)Have fun!"
4,a bit of a bummer after riven,"i was really excited when i got this for xmas. and when i started palying it, the 3d graphics were awesome. the story was really cool and everything but it seemed really short. when i actually found time to play the game, it didnt take me very long to beat it. all of a sudden, i find im finished with the game and its all done. the villain guy is pretty cool and you start to feel sorry for him. the puzzles are good,though i had a harder time with riven. over all, a great game. my only peeve is that its short."
3,A Plot worthy of the Myst series.,"Stunning graphics and an easy to manage user interface make this a great game for neophyte game players. There is a defined plot to follow and the puzzles are wonderfully suited to both the plot and the game flow. However, if you are a long time Myst game fan, and did well with Myst and Riven, I would not recommend this game for you. The puzzles are much too easy, and far too time consuming. The music, too, will disappoint long time Myst/Riven lovers. It lacks the originality of Robyn Miller's music and seems much too ""canned""; like movie soundtrack music. Overall, the game was a good follow on to the Myst series of games."
1,Misleading Technical Requirements,"I really enjoyed both Myst and Riven, and so was excited to buy Exile. However, I have had nothing but trouble trying to play the game: initial refusal to load, crashes, freezes. Though I checked the hardware requirements before purchase and patiently waited for the patches, I was recently told by Ubisoft tech help that I must purchase a 3D video card in order to play the game. The requirements in the user manual state that a 3D video card is optional. The experience has been very disappointing, not just because I so looked forward to playing the game, but because now I feel turned off from the whole series. Ubisoft really should have made an effort to make the game compatible with more machines and more video and sound cards."
1,Extremely Poor Quality & Disappointing Follow-up to Riven,"I loved Riven and Myst-I, but am very disappointed with Myst-III. The most siginificant problem is that it has so many bugs in it that it is difficult, if not impossible, to run the program. I'm still awaiting a release of the 3rd patch to the game so that I can get it to work properly. Given the care and attention that was taken with Riven, it is disppointing to see what Ubisoft has done (looks like the Microsoft quality control team has joined Ubisoft ...i.e., keep releasing software with bugs). This game was definitely released way too early...suggest you hold off your purchase until they release a working version or an accurate list of pc configurations that are compatible. If you do purchase this program, be sure that you have the most powerful PC available and that you have downloaded all the ""patches"" from the Ubisoft web site to correct some of the bugs...and then maybe it will work."
2,A little buggy...,"I absolutely loved the original Myst and Riven. However, the newest installment is plagued with a variety of gliches. It runs just fine on some of the newest, fastest computers, but has significant difficulties on many others (including mine). If you want to buy it, visit the website first www.myst3.com and read up about it in the users' forum. They are working on a patch (a couple are already out but don't fix everything) but then again, they've been saying this since June and it's October. Buyer beware."
4,Nuts and bolts,"This game is for the technically versed player. Nuts and bolts are needed to solve the puzzles; scenery and lay-out are interestingly confusing, somtimes. Perhaps there are too many technical skills demanded for a girl like me. But if you are a nuts- and bolts tinkerer you will love this."
1,RIPOFF!,"If you don't own it consider this; This game crashes and will not run on over 50% of the platforms installed on. Check out the tech support forums at ubisoft.com for more on this. This company did not properly perform beta testing (the allmighty dollar?) and have been promising ""a patch"" since the games release date. The patch continues to be pushed back, and may yet be available during your lifetime. At any rate, the company was aware of these problems and pushed the game anyhow.I would advise avoiding Ubisoft like HIV."
2,Macintosh Buyers Beware!,"After thoughly enjoying the original Myst and Riven games, I am severly dissappointed by Exile - and I haven't gotten a chance to really play it yet! I tried the typical install on my iMac. The movies ran jerkily and the sound was atrocious! I couldn't run it on the Full Install because it requires a whopping 2.36G. My husband tried running it on his newer iMac and it also had syncing problems between the sound and video. He's a guru at Mac issues so we're tweaking in hopes of getting it to run - but we really shouldn't have to do this. I suspect UBI Soft developed this on PCs instead of Macs like Cyan did and transported it to the Mac platform which often causes such problems. So, if you have a Mac and want to play Exile you might want to hold off a bit! I'll write another review if it actually works because I still want to see those great graphics shown in the trailers!"
1,Hype galore.,"The flower zone is too dull, in fact this whole game is dull, dull, dull. There is no story, and the puzzels are just plain stupid. Spend hours arranging reflectors. I don't think so.And let me tell you about the flower zone. First of all, the graphics rely on 'jumping' to the next point, so there is little pathway to follow, given that there is no 3d progress to take you to the next point of play. The screen jumps to your next location in even a more lazy way than Riddle of the Shinx did. Plus, once you have 'landed' at the next point in the 'jump', the stupid game has you turned off the point you 'landed at' so that you are looking cockeyed. I really hate how that happens...programmers, please place us facing the way we landed. I am not anal enough to want to figure out how I can go down a path and end up facing a direction I did not turn to face...I hated Schizm, but I think I hate this more. It is really a bad game. I have played many adventure games, but this is really lousy."
1,"Waste of time, makes you dizzy","If you like going in circles, with no idea what you are supposed to be doing, then you will enjoy this game. The puzzles are intricate, way too pedantic for my tastes. The obsessive attention to detail may suit a shut in, but I need a little more action. The cutscenes are pretty boring, and the actors are completely cheesy. The storyline does not motivate me one bit.I do not like the mouse movement, it is far too slow, I prefer being able to ""run"" on my own. Pointing and clicking is very disorienting. In most cases I have noticed that ""zip"" mode does not help. It takes forever to move from place to place.I have been frustrated with this game long enough... I'm selling it. If no one will buy it, I'm throwing it in front of a bus."
5,What??? Not for impatient gamers?!?,"Exile was so much fun -- I solved it in 8 days! And gosh...I'm a guurrrl!! I have NO PATIENCE whatsoever, and no mechanical abilities to boot...but, the game was a hoot! It just takes a little common sense. My husband, who IS mechanically inclined, was a bit perturbed with me!Buy the game! The graphics are great!!"
4,MYST 3-EXILE,"I dont know what the problems other people are having but on my computer this game runs fine. I have a compaq presario with 433mhz intel celeron,96mb ram,and a AGP PRO GRAPHICS CARD,3D 360 DEGREES VIDEO GAME CAPABILITY AND A YAMAHA SOUND DRIVER.I am not real good on technical terms but this game is running fine on what I have. It seems to me that most of the people are having problems with systems that have multiple drivers like DVD,CD-RW,and so on.I hope UBI comes up with the patches quickly because this is a very good game.But I still liked MYST and RIVEN better."
4,Practical,"This book was money and time well spent. We of the Christian faith usually fail to recognize that the way we read scripture at our point in place and time is not the only way it has been read. Indeed, many others in whom the Spirit dwells have read it differently. To understand those alternative readings of scripture is not to undermine the foundation of our faith, but to enrich it with the experience of those who have gone before. Well written enough for a finicky reader and objective enough for an armchair scholar. Some chapters could have been more comprehensive (e.g., the patristic era.) Any serious teacher of scripture, clergy or layman, should have this under their belt as essential background knowledge."
3,Excellent picture marred by hum / buzz,"First the good: the picture quality is outstanding, better than the Sony Wegas I saw at the store and better than the 27"" Sony XBR I have in my family room. It has a video input on the front and 2 inputs in the back - the back inputs are particularly handy because Input 1 can be regular composite video or S-video and Input 2 can be composite or component. (By comparison, the 2nd back video input on the Sony is component only.) The BBE sound feature is a nice addition. I like the fact that the set footprint is relatively small, allowing it to blend in to a smaller room.Now the bad: a very noticable humming coming from the back of the set make this annoying to watch at low volume levels. This might be tolerable in a family room or other noisy area, but be warned you may not be happy with this set in a bedroom. This is what I bought the set for, and I will be returning it for this reason."
2,"Excellent picture, sound problems","I purchased the JVC flat TV instead of the similiar SONY model because it was a bit cheaper. The JVC had an excellent picture and plenty of inputs for my A/V equipment. I was very pleased with the picture. The screen looked fanastic. The problem was with the sound. On every channel I tried, I heard an annoying hum or hissing sound from the speakers. I asked my wife and she said that she could hear the sound as well. The noise was very distracting and was ultimately the reason I returned the TV to the store and bought the SONY."
3,mca,"i bought this tv for the price compared to SONY. the ""BUZZ"" is inescapable and very annoying. as another reader wrote, i bought this tv for the bedroom, the BUZZ is unbearable, especially at low volume. i returned it and got the 20"" flat SONY(300 model), it was on sale, and for 20.00 more, it was well worth it. go with SONY, even if you have to wait for a sale, i got it for fifty buck off. i've heard that toshiba also has a ""BUZZ"" problem."
1,Two units failed. Tech support worthless.,"When I configured the first unit, it froze when disabled WEP on 802.11a. After waiting almost an hour for support, I was told to reset it (I already had), and then return it since the ""diag"" light still lit.When I disabled WEP on the replacement unit, it froze just the the previous one had. My email to support described the status of the indicators, and that I had already tried to reset it. Supports reply was for a different product, asked me to try to reset it, and asked for the status of the indicators. Not at all helpfull.Since I knew the exact steps I went through that caused the second unit to freeze, I asked that support try the steps I went through to determine if they had a firmware problem. They asked me to take my laptop back to the store I bought the AP from, and see if I can't get my laptop to work there. No mention of my broken access point.I highly recommend that you do not purchase this unit."
4,Work Great!!!,"Just purchased the dual access point by Linksys. I highly recommend it for those who have a small office with line-of-sight need to communicate wirelessly between computers. The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating is that I use it in a two story home and was disappointed when it couldn't reach in some areas of the house. I suspect it's because of certain building materials in the house but given the short distances between computer and access point, I felt it should have gotten a connection."
1,802.11a simply does not stay connected,"I am using the WAP51ab with an IBM T-41 with built in 802.11a and b capability. The 802.11a will not stay connected with this WAP for more than a couple of hours. My laptop is within line of sight of the WAP at all times.To solve the problem, I am required to shutdown the WAP for about 30 seconds. When I turn the WAP back on, it instantly connects to the laptop without any user intervention (which means that the laptop is working fine).Followed all of the Linksys suggestions without any luck. Unfortunately, I need to revert back to the WAP11 or choose another brand.Recommendation: DO NOT BUY this WAP unless you do not mind rebooting it a couple of times trhoughout the day."
4,Wireless,"People keep complaining about not being able to be in there basement and get a signal. I had the same problem, but then I took some time and adjusted where the unit was placed, (made sure it was away from interference Power supplies, monitor, ect) and placed it on a shelf away from my computer equipment and my coverage got much better, I think a downstairs bathroom only gets bad reception but Hey I should not be on from there anyhow :-)"
1,11a Band Won't Stay Connected,"Using WAP51AB and WPC51AB (on Dell Inspiron 8200 notebook running XP Pro). Found installation and configuration easy for both devices, but 11a connection consistenly fails when WAP51AB locks up after 10 to 60 minutes of use. Must recycle (and occasionally reset) WAP51AB to restore connection. Upgrading WAP51AB firmware (to v.1.02) and WPC51AB driver (to 12/3/2002 version) does not help. Neither does switching channels or changing beacon intervals on WAP51AB. Returned original WAP51AB at Linksys support's suggestion, but having same problems with replacement unit. Recommend you avoid this product until Linksys gets the bugs worked out (if they ever do). Would avoid WPC51AB also, since 11a connection problem may reside with that product as well as with the WAP51AB. FYI, I own several other Linksys products and they all work fine."
1,"Don't buy a Linksys Wireless Product, unless","you have line of sight access to the WAP from your network card. I bought a Cisco 1120 WAP and love it. I can go all over the house, no problems at all. This thing would die if I went across the house like I do with the Cisco."
4,"Works great, less filling","WAP point has great range and can utilize it throughout the house. I can even sit outside at the grill (~100 feet through concrete walls) without a hitch. Have easily had 3 clients on w/o a hitch (Work Laptop - Cisco Aironet 350 card, Home Laptop - Netgear WAB501, Friend - Linksys Something or Other).Would recommend -- didn't expect to function outside w/ block walls, but was pleasantly surprised."
1,thought i was the only one,"i've been having the same problem with my wap51ab as described by many others. i would lose my connection after 30-60 minutes and my dell latitude would act like the wpc54a was not present. i haven't had any problems with my system though (keeping my fingers crossed) since i shut off all power to everything at the surge protector for 5 minutes. like i said i haven't had any problems since, it been about 48 hours. i would stay away from this access point and perhaps if i felt daring try the new G."
1,Will not work with DHCP networks,"The documentation fails to mention the fact that this router not only requires that it be configured with a static IP address (no DHCP support), but that any 802.11a or 802.11b client connecting to your network is required to use a static IP address as well. Basically, you can't use DHCP with this access point - which for all intents and purposes makes this an expensive piece of junk plastic... but... I did return it for the 802.11g access point (Linksys WAP54G) which works perfectly."
1,ALL ABOUT TECH SUPPORT,"I bought a different Linksys networking tool that never worked and got nothing but runaround from the much touted tech support. I'd get through only to have an operator tell me they'd call back within 24 hours. I would never get that much needed call back. I finally returned the item and got a the same thing for free from my internet provider. Don't buy anything Linksys, unless you like frustration and useless equpiment."
1,Not what it use to be.......,"I had some older rolls (as in years)of this product that I had bought locally from a big box store, which I used occasionally. When my last roll ran out I could no longer find it locally so I ordered them though Amazon. The arrived quickly, but the product is not worth anything. The adhesive will not stick to anything but the smoothest and cleanest surface, much unlike the older rolls I had. Don't bother buying this product unless you like throwing your money away."
2,Not at all what the title implies,"Potential buyers will very probably think that this book outlines a methodical training program for increasing one's mental toughness and readiness for battle or other lethal confrontations. It does no such thing. There is instead, a hodgepodge of information from military manuals about general military tactics, interspersed with a bunch of commentaries about how tough the training is for various elite military units. A serious student of military science will have seen most of this info before. I gave it two stars because a reader without any background will probably find it somewhat interesting. I haven't read any of McNab's other books, so I can't make a comparison. But if you're looking for a guide to the actual toughening process used by the SAS or any other high-speed unit, you won't find it here."
1,"Uninformed, generalistic BS","...The title of the book has almost nothing to do with the contents, which skip around so many different military subjects I'm not sure what the point is. He touches on each subject just long enough to list a few common-sense tips, then on to the next. I especially like the ambush diagrams which show the different ambush elements and teams firing at each other ( no - it wasn't a ""how not to do it"" picture). Very disappointing..."
3,Read the book description before buying,"I come from a background of enlisted and officer Marine Corps, working in psychiatric hospitals and counseling psychology. If you are looking for a book to strengthen your mental endurance, this ISN'T the book for you. While the book talks of improving one's mental agility, it instead talks of what some military special units do for training. General and vague, and certainly lacking do-it-yourself. Possibly the book ""Art of Cross Examination"" and ""The Tactical Edge"" are more helpful titles."
2,Simply useless.,"I've bought this book 'cause is one of the few talking about mental conditioning and training (this is also the reason for the second star on my rate!) involved in elite units. I've served the Italian Navy Spec. forces and i've passed a lot of ""bad"" days because i was very young and i didn't know anything about mental strenght...NOTHING OF ALL THIS STUFF IS IN THIS BOOK! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, YOUR TIME AND YOUR ENERGY with this mixture of informations catched around.A lot of commonsense sentences, big tactical mistakes, wrong names (COMBUSIN instead of COM.SUB.IN. !!)), useless relaxing techniques which make you like the fool of the village.Search, study, experiment, try on your skin and then tell : ""I'm ready to read a book to sharp my edge"", and start the loop again, for all your life.Simply another useless book."
2,Not what you probably think,"If you just want to know what some special forces units go through, then this book may be worth a look.Maybe I'm just dumb, but what I read in the description led me to expect a much different book. I am probably naive, but I would a book titles ""The SAS Mental Endurance Handbook"" to be written by someone with SAS experience and to be laid out as a ...handbook. This just is not.I am always fascinated to read how different groups approach the problems of mental endurance and performance under stress. I wish I could say this was a valuable addition to my library, but it's merely an OK read for people looking for general info and no actual training methods."
3,meh,It was interesting but no real useful information would be great for someone with little to no military knowledge. it isn't a guide or a how to gain mental endurance. it would be nice if all of the little quizes and old intel. tests had answers someplace!
3,Husky trash compactor bags,"There are 40 bags in this one box for an extra low price (usually the other come in bags of 15 at same price). My biggest problem is that they do not have holes that they are suppose to have to attach to the trash compactor and everytime I use the compacting button, the bag caves in. Otherwise they are strong and good bags for a great price, just annoying without the 4 holes precut."
5,Best round compacter bags,Since Home Depot no longer carries these bags no place else to get them except on Amazon.
5,Excellent Value!,"These Husky compactor bags are just as good as the ones purchased from Viking for our Viking compactor but at a fraction of the cost. The only difference between the Viking product and this is the need to cut holes to attach to the knobs on the compactor. After using these bags, i won't switch back to those from the Viking dealer."
3,Solid Compactor Bags,"Strong construction but bags can be cumbersome to load in the compactor - might be that our compactor is old. On the whole I like the bags since there are no drawstrings, you can easily tie the bags once removed and it creates a better seal than a drawstring (prevents leaks and smells). Would recommend the item, but gave it 3 stars due to the few drawbacks."
2,Compactor bags,Bags are strong enough but are slightly too small for compactor. Causes bag to collapse every time you use it.
5,Great Compactor Bags,If your compactor bags have been leaking then try these Husky bags. They don't leak! They are on a roll but NOT perforated so less chance of leaky spots. I highly recommend these. Purchased them at Amazon and they came quickly.
1,INITIAL SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SELL ANY ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS IN USA ( Please do not buy anything from them),I recently bought a TV from Initial. Its a nightmare.. first the TV was damaged on the TV and they claimed that its brand new. I called their Customer service which is outsourced in China or some asain country..Customer service does not speak any english.. I finally set up the TV and the Remote does not work..so I called the customer service and They DO NOT SPEAK ANY ENGLISH!! I managed to make them understand I need a replacement for the remote.. I got a remote after shipping mine with my own money.. I got a remote after one month Which is not working .. The story gets only worst.. now the TV buttons are not working!! for the last time in my life I would buy anything from Initial.. I just wonder how they are allowed to sell in USA.. This company is a major Scams
1,WOW! WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!!!,"THIS BRAND OVERALL HAS LOTS OF ISSUES.FIRST OF ALL,DVD PLAYER IS VERY MEDIOCRE.THE PICTURE SOMETIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF MOVIE FREEZES AND YOU HAVE TO REBOOT THE DISC. SOUND SUCKS. AT THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMER SERVICE,THERE IS ONLY ANSWERING MACHINE AND NO ONE RETURNS YOUR CALL EVEN AFTER A MONTH. I HAD TO RETURN MINE. I AM GOING TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS BRAND-SO SHOULD YOU.BOTTOMLINE-BUY SOME BRAND NAME LIKE TOSHIBA OR SAMSUNG OR SONY AND YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IN FUTURE."
5,Remote Control by Barbara Kruger,"Kruger's work is some of her best yet! She is, without a doubt, the most effective and AFFECTIVE artist of our time. Her art aggressively attacks the viewer, as do her written words. She takes control, and forces the reader to reflect on his or her position/experience/actions in life. Influential and powerful, radical, aggressive, and moving, the book is all put together with wit, dark humor, and poetic grace. An outstanding piece of work from an outstanding, talanted artist!-Nathaniel Lacktman"
3,i really want to like it,"i really do, but it's so academic at times i just can't get into it. it's not that i'm not an intelligent guy because i am, and it's not that i don't appreciate kruger's work because i do. it's simply that what i most love about kruger is the accessability of her work, and this book was very inaccessable at times. i'm glad i have it in my collection, but i wouldn't call it an ""enjoyable"" read. it's really more work than fun. i guess it depends on your feelings about kruger if the work is worth it. this is an important book for an art historian or cultural critic, but i would not recomend it as an introduction to kruger."
5,winning endgame,"This book is very readable, as Alburts books are.You can learn a lot about endings in enjoyable way.I thinks it is excellent for anyone under rating 2000."
2,pikake oil perfume,i only received 1 of the 2 bottles i ordered..i told them and still never received it. Item smells good but scent does not last that long. In Hawaii we used a spray pikake cologne that seemed to last much longer even though this is an oil essence and should stay much longer. Item only fair - thick and greasy - better to use on light bulbs for a room essence i think - than a body essence.
2,Should last longer for an oil,I LOVE LOVE LOVE the scent of this but rarely wear it because it doesn't last longer than an hour.
2,You'd have to be a true Blue Devil fan to like this book,"I got this book thinking it might give me some insight into how Coach K motivates his teams, organizes his practice sessions, and instills leadership qualities in his athletes. What I got was a less than thrilling re-hash of some of his best quotes as seen through the eyes of a local news reporter. You'd have to be a true Blue Devil fan to like this book. I didn't, so I gave it to one of my co-workers who graduated from Duke. He likes it."
5,Excellent for beginnner teachers,"I bought this book about 3 years ago, and I still use it every chance I get. The stories are easy to present, with lots of teacher helps, perfect for the beginner Sunday School teacher. The kids go crazy for the stuff too, they really enjoy it. I use both this book and it's companion, Volume 2. I found the lessons appropriate for ages from 3 up to about 7, which is good if you are teaching a lot of different ages in the same class. My favorite lesson is Creation, which uses white cheese to make moons, apples to make stars, and oranges to represent the sun. The lessons require a little bit of planning but the results are well worth it. Highly recommended."
5,Great book!,I ordered this book for use in my preschool vacation bible school and it is great! It has a lot of ideas and is very helpful! The lessons are geared for the preschool age and allows them to interact and have fun! I highly recommend this book!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Not the greatest, but works","This stuff adheres well, even to nylon webbing. I got it to trim out some of my gear for overnight races (running).This product, and especially this color does not seem extremely reflective though.This is the best deal I could find between amazon and froogle."
3,Not bad,"I bought this as a supplement to the reflectors on my bicycle due to extensive night time riding. I wrapped some of this tape around my seat post. While it is quite sturdy and flexible, it's brightness leaves something to be desired. It only reflects direct bright light. I would say this is only suitable for use on something like a vehicle trailer, or perhaps road signage. I will say that when it does reflect, it is sickeningly bright, but in order for it do so so, it needs a very bright direct light.-M"
4,Many Uses,"I purchased this item to use as a visual aid to go along with my hitch mount bike rack and cargo carrier. For those that don't believe this tape is reflective enough, go ahead and put a piece on something and take a picture of it at dusk. You will see that a flash will expose the reflective properties of the tape...the picture of the bike rack on the back of the white SUV is mine.I am happy with the tape and I have used it on the posts and other areas of my bike rack and hitch mount cargo carrier when they are in their upright position. I will provide additional details after some moderate use, but at the moment I think it's safe to say that this is reflective tape that does the job."
1,Not really reflective,This tape is not reflective like a bicycles reflector. It is more like shiny new car paint. Not very reflective at all =/
2,Not as bright as I wanted,"I was looking for the kind of tape that reflects light so thoroughly that it almost seems to glow in the dark by itself. This tape unfortunately only reflects quite a direct and bright light so it is not as useful. I have the tape on my canes and walkers to make me more visible to cars. It does some good I am sure, but not as much as I expected."
1,Not REFLECTIVE at all,"Not REFLECTIVE at all, took it out of the packaging,...and dissappointed with it immediatley.it looks like regular red tape.i'm returning it."
5,Great program.,"It's a great program that includes three elements of first responders, police, fire department and paramedics all in one program."
4,"Portmeiron Plates, nice service","First shipment came within the specified time line, but the box was crushed and one plate was broken. Within minutes of my phone call to Amazon (even in the late evening) I had an RMA and printed out the packing slip the next day. They had already shipped the replacement order before I got the damaged goods in the mail at no charge to me (other than the gas to stop at UPS). New shipment arrived in a week. 4 Stars because they did not change the packing materials like I had suggested. Overall, nice service, nice plates."
3,5 out of 6,"This was an order of a 6 plate set. One plate arrived broken. Amazon refused to either replace the plate or give me a refund for that one plate. They suggested instead that they would pay for the entire set to be returned, and give me a refund for the entire set. Since even with 1 plate broken, the set was still a very good price, I decided to keep the remaining 5 plates, although I would have preferred a refund for that one broken plate or a substitute."
1,Danby is poor quality,"Have had a Danby Silhouette dehumidifier just over one year. The stupid fan runs all the time, & the water collector bucket gets mold in the bottom. To remove the bucket is like pulling teeth from an elephant...very tight fit.That is, when it worked!The fan still works, but the CONDENSER JUST POOPED OUT...only 1+ years. You have to suspect that they build in that amount of durability...just past the 1 year warrantee! This is particularly annoying since these things weigh in the 50 lb. range, AND since it's an appliance (in CT) I'll probably have to pay to dispose of it!!I'm here today to research for another (different brand) dehumidifier to replace it! I would NEVER buy a Danby (anything) again.I wish Emerson Quiet Kool dehumidifiers were still being made. I have one which keeps going like the Energizer bunny...so many years I can't count! I have it hooked up with an external pump so that I don't have to empty it. What a dream!"
1,Danby Dehumidifier,"Worked great for 3 months then the compressor went out. It took the service shop, which was 120 miles away, 8 months to get the warranty repair parts from Danby, even they said, never buy from this company."
1,Danby Dehumidifier Poor Quality,Over the past 5 years my Danby dehumidifier has been in and out of service so often I've lost count. Eventually replaced with another new one and I had problems with that one! Don't touch them at any price!
3,Solid,"A good book that talks about the trobrianders of New Guinea. It's a little dry, but interesting if you want to learn about their culture or need to do research."
5,Reviews and Essays from Forty Years of Music,"Born in Yugoslavia John Simon is one of the few remaining classical critics. His scope is vast, this book is on music but there are other books on theater and film. His insight into music comes not from his performing ability (he doesn't) but from his love. His comments display his wide knowledge of not only music but the entire range of the performing arts.The book contains four big sections on Criticism from the 1970s, 80s, 90s and the 2,000s. Within each section there are reviews and essays that are arranged chronologically according to the dates they were originally published in the various magazines or newspapers for which Mr. Simon writes.You will find Mr. Simon's writing to be erudite and a pleasure to read. His topics are far ranging, and he is able to see connections between his current subject and a wide range of past events.Very enjoyable reading."
4,woman most wanted,I am fortunate to know Harper Allen but had not yet read any of her books. This was a surprise especially that the heroine reminded me of her. I could just picture Harper crusading in the same manner. This book has been mailed to a friend and I can hardly wait for the next one to be published. Bravo Harper!
2,Disappointing,"After reading the back cover on this book, and a recommendation from a friend, I bought it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. For the most part, I just scanned it. It was predictable, no challenge at all. I had not read any Harlequin books in a long time, and now I remember why I quit reading them."
3,"Soft riding shock, not for towing, though","I installed these on my 2007 RAM 2500 Cummins. The ride was slightly smoother when I wasn't towing my 11,000# 5th wheel. However, when towing, they did not provide the ride I expected. The front end does a lot of floating and is too soft.When I come to a stop, the front end will jounce excessively as though the shocks were worn.If I had to do it over, I would have gone with Bilstiens or a heavier Monroe."
4,Valuable information for beginners,This small book although it only covers a dozen or so of the many thousands of varieties of succulents was a great purchase for me. After five minutes of skimming through it I learned enough to make it worthwhile many times over. I would recommend it to anyone starting out with a love of succulents.
4,good as a rehabilitation shoe for injured runners/walkers,I bought this sandal in preparation for a 3 Day/60 mile walk. I needed a back up open-toe shoe in case of blisters/ toe injuries. I never did need them during the 60 miles ( thankful for my training) But I did try them out prior to the walk & definitely wouldn't choose them over my running sneaks to do long walks or runs. The padding & straps are a little fussy & need correct placement or you'll get blisters. They are pretty ugly(sorry) but I did find them comfortable for walking 3 or 4 miles in. I also did jog a mile in them & found they can provide enough support as long as the straps/pads are in good placement. I kept them to have on hand for any future toe injuries. I think they would be great for someone who spends a lot of time on their feet walking & has an injured toe. Or definitely for a runner who wants to get a short run in with an injured toe.
1,Disappointing,"We are looking for a replacement portable color TV/AM/FM for anold GE that we've used daily for over a dozen years. This Jensenis unfortunately not it.The picture and sound are poorer than the GE's, tuning iscompletely manual, and there are no presets. On the plus side,the Jensen is smaller and lighter, and has audio/video/cable inputs. It also has an AC adaptor, and a 12V cord/adaptor for use in a car.I expect that I'll use it for setting up my surround soundsystem, then give it to our church for the upcoming rummage sale."
2,Empire Builder N gauge set,I have been a model railroader for years in HO scale. I do not have the space I had in the past so I ordered an N gauge set. The 4-8-4 I ordered is not a smooth running engine. It has to be pushed to start and will not stay running. I find the track to be OK but falls apart easy. You will need to nail it down or it will lift up and cause cars to derail.
4,Nice unit,I purchased this a few weeks ago and so far it has met my expectations. I like the new track format (EZ) and the cars and locomotive work well together.
3,My excitement derailed,"I bought this train considering it a good start for a hobbyist -- whichit is; however, I soon discovered the bad before the good. Assembling thetrack sections was painfully difficult -- literally. I needed to slam themtogether to connect them and my hands slipped and pressed the rail, scrapingmy hand. The good is that I love trains and research everything possibleabout them. The detail is wonderfully authentic and closest possible to anactual train for an N scale. I'll keep this train as long as possible fora model."
1,Very disappointing! (Yes! I am mechanical!),"I set this up with care, But the build quality was so poor that we did not even take any other train cars out the set. My Son who should be playing with his new train days before Christmas has to wait! FYI-It's made in CHINA -Not happy with this purchase!"
1,Bachmann Train Set empire builder,What a pain your power system in the USA is 120v our system in NewZealand is 240 so a complete burnout of transformer and controller. Wanted to send back to Amazon but would have cost me ninety NZ dollars not worth it
1,Terrible,"The train itself was fine. The track was miserable. The connection between the power and the track were none existant ant did not make a good connection. This train set could not be used as supplied. This set would never influence anyone to look at model trains as a hobby. I have built two layouts before ,one a TT guage and a HO guage. This is not sour grapes as I bought the set to see if I could handle the size as my hands are not what they used to be and neither are my eyes."
3,Hard to understand...,"While my son likes this game, I have to interpret what Elmo is saying from time to time. We prefer the Lion King game over this one. They are both fun and easy enough for a 3 year old, but the voice on the Lion King game is much more understandable."
4,great game -hard to understand elmo,"This is a good game for a 4 year old. not too easy, but not too challenging. but boy is elmo hard to understand!!! I love the music in this game, but the elmo narration could be better. i know my son doesn't understand half of what elmo is saying and he just figures out what he's supposed to do by trial and error. I love the animation - elmo runs into something and he bounces back and giggles. my son loves it and runs elmo into things on purpose just to see that. really cute. It did not get 5 stars just because the narration could and should be more clear for the little ones to understand. we love having to find the animals and then the letters."
1,Bad Scan Format,"I could not even get into this book as there was no way to adjust the format. The text was too small and I could not zoom in. I have returned the ebook, but if the formatting gets corrected I will purchase it again."
4,Don't Waste Your Money,"You will regret this purchase. Unless, of course, you do not mind re-adjusting the poles and pulling it upright for your child every 3 minutes! However, if your child will continually sit still inside and never touch the teepee itself, then this is the toy for you! In my opinion, this item was a complete waste of money. The poles do not stay in place properly when children move about inside. I was constantly having to fix it so it would stand upright for the kids. Not at all durable. Had it up for less than a week when a pole broke. The material also ripped easily. Wasn't even worth giving to the Goodwill. It now takes up space in some landfill. Thought it would be cute for my little boy's cowboy themed room. Too bad, what a waste."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!,I am the assistant director of a preschool and the school purchased two of these tents for our Thanksgiving Center. They have been awful from day one - They do not stay together - The material rips very easy. BIG waste of our money. We purchased them over the summer and just got them out of the box the 1st of November - cannot return them because of the 30 day refund policy! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
3,Do not buy this tent!!!,"This tent is easy to put together, but it moves to much.it feels like it is going to fall apart and the metal tent peices don't stay in the tent plastic. I bought it in November for my sons for Christmas, I am past my 30 DAYS and I am trying to return it...."
4,fun and easy,"We purchased this product for our 2nd grade classroom to have something hands on about Indians. The product was easy to assemble, (it took me 15 min.) as long as you FOLLOW the directions. The poles aren't all shock corded as listed though, but anyone who has put any tent together, can put this one together! The kids can't wait to use it! I've moved it many times and not had any problems. I think maybe some other reviewers did not FULLY connect some things or that they are expecting too much from a children's toy."
2,Not worth the $30 bucks,"This is the buggiest game I've ever purchased, and it does not stand up to EA Games shining (but rapidly fading) history. For example: I've been stuck on a rooftop early in the game covering some guy name Klaus while he picks the lock on a door. Meanwhile, Nazis are coming out of the woodwork. After about the 10th try, he finally opens the door and we go to the bottom of the stairs where . . . nothing happens. The game is stuck. I cannot walk past him, and he just stands there. I go back outside and nothing happens for several minutes. Eventually the Nazis show back up and I run out of ammo. This makes no sense because we supposedly on a covert mission, and we should be running away once through the door.In addition, the graphics engine is severely showing its age, and overall the gameplay, AI, etc. is way behind."
2,save your money,"This game has its moments, but most of the time its more Rambo-style kill everything that moves action. Also, there is very little ammo to be picked up. The game throws a LOT of enemies at you, and several times I've run out of ammo. There may be a pile of corpses at your feet, but you can't get their ammo or weapons. Very frustrating. I am wondering if this is a bug or intentional. At one point I found a cheat code on the net and gave myself ammo that way. The gameplay and graphics are ok if you have enough ammo to survive. There's nothing here however that you can't get out of CALL OF DUTY or the other Allied Assault games. The ammo problem takes away at least one star for me. It literally makes it impossible to play on certain levels."
4,More of the same and that's it.,"You get more Nazis to shoot. The weapons are pretty much the same as well as the gameplay. But the original game is great, so I have no complaints."
2,boring,this game would be fun if it didn't have to compete with games like UT2003 and BF1942. I find that the WW2 scenery is dull looking and overall the gameplay is dense. But if you don't like colorful games where there is alot of jumping and flying about maybe this game if for you. Also I find anykind of expansion distasteful because it spreads viable players very thin so there are less games with players to choose from for any given game.
5,Best MOHAA Expansion,"I really recommend this over SpearHead.It is fun. The battles and maps are alot more realistic than SH's. If you loved MOHAA, then you'll really love this."
1,"Someone should be fired, like say, EVERYONE","Breakthrough takes the wonderful legacy of the original Medal of Honor game and pounds it into the ground. This game is an abject failure on nearly every level.The strategy of EA (or whoever is responsible for over-hyped franchised expansion packs) is to throw overwhelming numbers of Nazis at you in nearly every level until you freak out or quit the game out of the frusteration of lag.Breakthrough offers no innovative improvements from the original and will make you start to question whether you actually enjoyed the original game. Yes, that's actually how bad it is. If you thought Spearhead was a dissapointment, brace yourselves for this disaster.Save your money and buy something else. Boo!"
2,Disappointing Sequel to MOHAA,"Allied Assault was one of the best games I have ever played. Spearhead was too short and added nothing new. I got pumped up for Breakthrough, I thought EA would try better after Spearhead. Breakthrough while fun, is really hard. You cannot pick up HARDLY ANY ammunition from dead soldiers. Right now I'm on the last mission, Monte Battaglia. All there is is endless waves of Germans, and you are low on health and ammunition throughout the whole thing. I thought of uninstalling it. It is also not worth the thrity dollars or so. Wait until Call of Duty comes out.BOTTOM LINE: Could have been a descent game, but it is nothing new. Shame on EA."
3,Medal of Honor : Allied Assault - Breakthrough,"Breakthrough is an expansion pack to Medal of Honor - Allied Assault. It needs AA to install the game. BT is not bad but not as good as AA or Spearhead, It is much harder than AA or Spearhead, The black and white movie cutsences between the missions are fantastic. The level design and the gameplay is not as good as i expected, i expected a lot after Spearhead which was better than AA. There are also some graphical corruptions in the game, I got a lot of black patches expecially in the rain levels. I have a GeForce Fx. The graphics are also quite date by today's standerds. I would recommend Breakthrough only to die hard MohAA fans."
3,Worth it for Liberation Mode.,"Yeah, the game is short and uninspired, and they don't offer a whole lot of new stuff for multiplayer games. But they came up with the Liberation Mode, and it's almost worth it just for that. Basically, in Lib mode, instead of killing an enemy, you put them in your jail. Your team has to guard the jail while at the same time trying to free your teammates who have been captured and placed in the enemy jail. Usually, when the two jails are liberated, the games goes on for a long time and becomes insanely fun."
4,Forget the mishaps of Spearhead and buy this,"I am a Medal Of Honor junkie. I beat Allied Assult in 3 days and Spearhead in 2. Allied Assult was great, Spearhead was awful. The EA games at the beginning showed that it wouldn't be the same as Allied Assult. It was much worse than I thought it would be. The levels were harder so you had to play them over and over til you beat them. There were fewer levels because of this. Breakthrough was different. Despite being obviously shorter it took the same time to beat as Allied Assult. The game play was better and there was actually a plot. The game had a few sound problems but otherwise it went fine. The new weapons were cool especially the Vickers Berthier. The first level, the Kasserine Pass previewed the rest of the game and I new it would be good after that level. If your one of the people that said they wouldn't buy another Medal Of Honor after buying Spearhead, take it back before you look stupid."
5,highly recomended,"I had the fortune of seeing this documentary at a film festival here in NYC.It is so good, and empowering that I had to get the DVD. Not only is it entertaining, but also it teaches us of the complexities and choices we all have to take in life. And it is a good reminder that no matter who we are or where we come from we all have dreams and expectations. The only difference is that for some the road ahead is more uphill than for the rest of us. you won't be dissapointed."
5,"""Black Picket Fence"" Goes Farther Than ""8 Mile""","Sergio Goes, the director of this intriguing documentary, goes farther and deeper into the making of a rap artist than the makers of the film ""8 Mile."" Like the movie, the doc does a good job of delving into the oddyssey of a struggling rapper, but ""Black Picket Fence"" goes the extra mile to show how the real-life musician finds his way out of the 'hood' and ironically ends up in the 'burbs.' Whether his modest success is a spin-off of the American Dream, as the title implies, I'm not sure...but it's quite a journey, and there are some memorable scenes along the way."
4,It ain't Evil Beaver...but I like it,"Well, I'm a HUGE fan of Evil Beaver so when I heard that the drummer Laura Ann Beaver was in this band (as Laura Ann Masura...her REAL name I guess) I had to buy it. It is a good CD - not as heavy as the Beaver but that Laura Ann didn't let me down. The drumming is amazing. It is more pop/punky and a little less Metal then Evil Beaver but the songs are good and it is well worth buying. I think this will be a classic must have CD that no one ever knew about. Treat yourself and buy it."
1,Better Q.C. needed,"This book arrived with all the left side pages blank twice. The publisher needs better quality control. As it was, Amazon made the return painless."
3,Not that bad,"The perfume was not the thing on the image, the bottle was slightly diferent plus it doesnt have the atomizer... could have returned it but it didnt mind since the scent was the real thing..."
4,Love it but....,"I love all of Britney's perfumes, however I strongly dislike how they are advertised! It shows that they come with a ""puffer"" but they do not. Kinda upsets me a little."
5,Pretend that it's not by Britney Spears!,"This perfume smells so good! It's has a really nice balance of sweet and sexy tones and it lasts all day! This is the second bottle I've purchased (it's my signature scent) and I can't imagine using another perfume! I get so many compliments :) My only warning is that it's a really soft scent, and I've heard people complaining that it doesn't hold or that it is too subtle. I like it cause people have to get closer to smell you and, honestly, I haven't noticed it fading away too fast during the day, but everyone is different. I'd say give this a try! If you don't like it, you can send it my way! Hope you like it! :)"
4,Rating by Suzanne,"This product was purchased for a Christmas present for my granddaughter. She seemed very excited when she opened her gift--she said that she ""loves"" the scent."
2,Smells Cheap!!!!,"Curious in control Smells like cheap deodorant spray. I would suggest The original ""Curious"" which has a soft pleasant scent, but this one is far from it. Its like a mix of fruit punch,and plastic......just not appealing."
5,Great fragrance!,"I love all the fragrances in the ""curious collection"" this one smells amazing and is a great night time perfume! I was so happy to find this on amazon, I've been searching for it for years. Now thanks to amazon, I own all of Britney's fragrances! I'm very happy with this purchase and am even happier with how quickly they delivered it to me!"
5,5F blade,"This is the perfect size to cut my standard poodles hair. It is not too short and leaves enough hair so the sun will not burn her. I live in Florida.. I used it 2 times and it works fine. I tried the attachment type , but that did not work thy would fall off or get stuck: because her hair is too thick.I have saved a lot of money grooming her myself and she loves having me fuss with her. It has paid for it self after the 2nd cut. Well worth it."
4,Clippers for Bishon's,I have clipped my own dogs for 25 years and found this to be a very good product to replace previous clippers. If you are a Bichon owner I highly rec. it. Thanks.
2,Not the best,I was a groomer for 4 yrs before I became a stay-at-home-mom. I still have a few family dogs (and my husband) that i give haricuts to. I needed another 7 blade and so I bought this one. I went to shave my husbands head and this blade left so many uncut hairs I was afraid I had put on an old blade accidentally. It was the brand new one and it did a terrible job of evenly cutting my husbands hair. I did keep it for a labradoodle I groom just as the beginning blade to us to get the majority off but I was not pleased in the overall clipping of this blade.
2,Didn't work on my dog :(,I bought this blade to use on my fine haired schnauzer for the lower part of his body. For whatever the reason it did not cut well. I am not sure if it was his hair type or if it was defective... I am thinking it might be his hair if I had to guess. I thought I would post this to save someone else the greif of returning it like I have to.
2,How difficult is it to make an egg slicer that works?,"This one lasted longer than my two previous ones, but it still broke. I had it for less than a year and used it solely on strawberries and hard boiled eggs. The wires broke. It's not a great egg slicer; it's not a terrible egg slicer."
1,Not Reliable Product,"This must be my 3 rd egg slicer. I bought an OXO slicer from Bed Bath and Beyond yesterday and it already broke while performing a test run; nothing was in it. Before, I purchased the KitchenAid egg slicer thinking it would work. After 5 months or so the wires broke. My husband did use this with eggs and mushrooms but who wants to buy 2 separate gadgets; I don't have much drawer space so that's why I used this for both mushrooms and eggs. Where is an egg slicer with blades instead of wires? Hope this helps people out there."
2,Not good for mushrooms,"This slicer is advertised as an egg and mushroom slicer. However, I have gone through 4 of them in short order trying to slice fresh white and baby portabella mushrooms. If mushrooms are what you need to slice, I would try the professional model."
1,This is why I'm here,"I have bought two of these in less than six months, the wires are cheap and break easily. That's why I'm here this morning, looking for something better. My mom's old one finally broke after 40 years, but I can't find one that lasts 6 months! I guess there is no such thing as American made wire anymore."
1,Junk,"This junk device (probably made in China) broke first time I used it. Granted, I was slicing a peach, not an egg. And yes, I took the stone out of the peach first."
1,Broke on olives!,I used this egg slicer on pitted black olives. It broke! I guess it's called an egg slicer for a reason - only use it on eggs!
5,amazing album/amazing artist,authentic. haunting. I love music to the point of intoxication. I own hundreds of albums and to put it succinctly: Tom House is the best songwriter I have ever heard.
3,Interesting Reading,"I read this book years ago and remembered how good it was. I loaned my copy out and never got it back. So, I usually can find older books at Amazon..."
4,"Finally,some text on the mob in Los Angeles.","After learning that a good friend of my fathers was ""connected"" with a made guy in the L.A. family,I became intrigued with the mob and have read every book I could find on the subject.In particular,books that make mention of Los Angeles and Las Vegas This is the only book I have read that gives detailed accounts of the L.A. family and its operations.Ovid Demaris does an excellent job with the annals of information he extracted from Fratianno and gets four stars from me.Anyone interested in the early days of Las Vegas,this book is a must."
3,A very different Super Hero,"Ilya Myuromets, the hero of this novel, is one of the most intriguing heroes ever created by an author. Full marks to Liz Williams on that. Otherwise, the novel lacks the depth one would expect from such a setting."
5,Never be without this book,"This is as comprehensive as any wine compendium comes. References can be found to just about anything you will come across, and certainly helps those who collect wine.The only complaint I have is that the old texts generally aren't updated. When a note dates from 1990 and says ""should be cellared for 3 more years"", does that mean 1993? Or should I take it as 3 years from the published edition date?Otherwise this is a great book and has helped me a lot as a novice."
3,Low budget but engaging,"This movie sells itself far more on mood and feeling than a compelling story line. While it is low budget, the production values seem quite high; the video quality seems mostly on par with large budgets, so don't expect a grainy handycam image, which is to its credit. The movie is mostly very creepy throughout, and is done on a perfect setting (a mostly uninhabited beach). Characters come and go through alternate states of very strange and normal. But note this is not a fast moving film. The story quite slowly evolves through revealing the truth of the peoples' situation, and does so by slowly unraveling minuscule parts of the story. I did find the approach interesting, but prepare yourself for a more contemplative, moody experience than an in-your-face shocker."
2,Seriously?,"I love a great book, but you can't seriously say this is one of those. Short chapters about absolutely nothing. If he's trying to recapture The Catcher In the Rye, or another coming of age classic, then he needs to get a new idea... Thankfully I didn't buy this book, but instead it was passed out a Beauty Fair for free. I guess that's one way for people to read your book.If you are looking for a great read that captures your attention the whole time, then skip this one. I think I am finally understanding the title after all...since I had ADD reading this silly book. There's better books to spend your time with."
4,Impressive Debut,This novel gives you a self-discovery adventure with Wayne Fencer. I felt as if I was walking in his shoes on the trail and in his mind. The story is emotional and thought provoking. I look forward to more from Brad Listi as this is an excellent and highly recommended read.
3,"OK, FOR A DEBUT NOVEL","It was okay,not bad for a debut novel. I think he's got some talent but it was kind of mundane and by the last third of book, I found myself skimming thru and skipping pages. Definitely not a book I would re-read , and not a page turner..."
5,Excellent read,"I really enjoyed reading this novel. Brad Listi intriduces you to a character, Wanye Fencer, who is struggling with the recent suicide of an ex-girlfriend. He is young and grapples with topics that a lot of people can relate to. You go on a journey with him as he tries to figure it all out."
1,Glib and Contemptible,"There isn't any need for this book. Really. Mr. Listi writes like an unemployed television writer, which, I would suppose, he is. Or will be, at any rate. Save your money."
3,Irish Folk Music,"This CD has music you would hear from a record from the 40's 50's or 60's. If you're an irish old timer, this cd is for you. It's not the best cd in the world, but some of the folk songs are ok."
5,Best book on C# databases for SQL to date,"If you read my other reviews you know I don't give five stars to books I've read, but I do here only because as of right now (October 2007), and using the Visual Studio 2005 with ADO.NET 2.0, this is the only book that will give you a step-by-step How To walkthrough on all aspects of SQL Server. It also has a chapter on ASP.NET. As for now, it's indespensible for me, learning this topic. A couple of years from now it might be trash, but that's the nature of computer books. I'm about 1/3rd of the way through the book and no serious errors have been found, just a few things you can fix or figure out yourself. The downloadable code works for the above environment."
3,Sturdy product - but makes for sore thumbs,"We've had this sprayer installed in our utility sink for a number of years. The sprayer has held up remarkably well - no leaks, still flexible hose - every feature still works well.The only reason we wouldn't rate this 5-star is that there is no spray once your grip is off the the side spray button. It takes a firm grip to hold in the button, and if you have even a small long-haired pet, your thumbs will be aching in the last half of your pet's bath!Wish we could recommend a different product that remedies this issue, but the only sprayer we could find with a ""hold spray on"" feature works off a shower head faucet, not a sink faucet (hello? sink faucet discrimination? :) ).Still great product for the money. Your pet will be more relaxed with a shower feature, and make for a happy, more efficient bath!"
4,"I like it, Great concept, My dog HATES it!","I bought this because I was so tired of bending down the entire bath with my English bulldog. He is almost one year old and already 60lbs so getting him used to the bath early on was the first thing we did and he used to love his baths. Until I bought this. When I first tried to use it he was terrified of it. I thought he might warm up to it but he still has not done so. I don't know if it is because it is new or the way it sprays directly on him or what but he tries, and has succeeded, in running out of the bath wet and covered in shampoo. I connected this to my bathroom sink (I have a double vanity so I use the one right next to the tub) and it really works well, except what other reviewers have stated, that you must hold the button in to keep it on. If I can only get my puppy to appreciate it then I would give it 5 stars but I think if you are considering trying one you should get this. I will keep trying and update if he decides it is not so bad."
1,Outdoor only,"I purchased this product to use indoors. While the instructions are clear, this product does not attach to a standard bathroom faucet. We even started taking the faucet apart and the pieces did not fit. Maybe a trip to the hardware store is in order to purchase some type of connector."
1,Didnt work with my shower,I tried to hook this is my shower and it would not fit. I was dissapointed that is did not work.
4,TriCam - you can't go wrong,"These are a great alternative to the more expensive active protection, ""cams"".I recommend purchasing a couple of these pinkys to supplement your rack. The larger tricams are less ideal, and I usually stay in and around the pink size of .5Climb on!"
2,Introduction to XP,"I'd consider this more of an introduction toXP rather a reference for mastering XP.If you want to know how to change the defaultsettings, use some of the XP tools or why chatprograms are good then this book is good for you.If you want to know how to work around XP ornitty gritty detail this book does nothelp much"
1,"abookarama, what happened?","I ordered a large manual on Windows XP from the seller -- abookarama. Abookarama shipped me a large book, but NOT the one I ordered, not even close in subject matter. I then sent FOUR e-mails to the seller (through Amazon) asking them to send the correct book. I got zero replies from the seller, just silence. Not a good way to run a business. Then I finally turned to Amazon, who refunded my credit card, quickly and impressively."
3,"OK, but . . .","Get the Osborne book ""The Complete Reference: Windows XP"" by John Levine & Margaret Levine Young instead.I've got both. I only grab this one second."
5,essential work,you have no choice but to buy this book if you think you're interested in photography.
3,Nothing new here,"If you have other Eggleston photo books this is apparently mainly a collection of photos from other books, according to the person I gave it to who returned it."
5,photography classic,"A photography classic.Some incredible masterpieces in this book, in an amazing printing quality.This is a must have for every Eggleston fan."
2,Cheat?,"This was expected to be 2 CDs of Steel Drums.Instead, one of the CDs has no steel drums, just some stuff I was not interested about.I'm very disappointed, thinking this was their way of getting rid of an unwanted CD, by packaging with something more interesting."
3,Caribean Steel Band,Pretty good CD. Reminds me of a band you'd hear at a beach Resort. The 2nd CD is mainly instrumental. Good pool side music.
4,Music from the islands,"This set of 2 CD's has both instrumental and vocal music, which captures the feel of the islands. I used this CD set for the background of a party with a Caribbean theme. It was perfect."
1,straight to dustbin,"Nothing on any of the cuts would make it to Hollywood on American Idol. The renditions of old faves are poor, the vocal cd uses synthesizer pans. You can't replicate the sound of steel drums with a synthesizer. The pan music on the second cd is poorly recorded and sounds clangy. They musicianship is just average. The last half of the cd (vocals again) is even worse than the first cd. ""On Top of Old Smoky""???? Give me a break! This is an insult to Caribbean culture!. I give it no stars, but the site says I have to give it at least one."
3,Small little imperfection,"I really can't say much but that on the ribbon the eagle is holding the word ""union"" is spelled wrong on my flag and it says ""unon."" Also, most people would probably think that the word ""soverignty"" is not supposed to be upside down but it is, I even looked it up so it's just the mispelling of ""union."""
4,More Inexperienced than Young,"I still haven't taken the plunge in starting my own business, but I've been doing a lot of reading about doing so. When I picked this up from the library, I expected to take one evening to zip through it. However, it seems to cover the basics of running a business very well. If you have already started your own business, you've probably already dealt with most of the issues presented here. If you're new to the business world (young or old), this book deserves serious consideration."
1,waste of money,"I regret buying this book. It's not a guide for young people to starting your own business unless you call part time babysitting a business or selling your goods at a flea market as having your own business. The ""businesses"" the author has in mind are are, for example, selling homemade goods to your friends or anyone else you can get to buy them. If you call having a lemonade stand a business, then this book may pertain to you."
4,Good supplement,This is a handy book to have around if you teach business--as I do at the high school level. It adds a variety of activities and ideas that can be implemented at any time during the course.
1,Isuzu Axiom Brake Drum,"This is absolutely the wrong Brake Drum for the Isuzu Axiom 2002-2004.The Bolt holes line up perfectly but the center hub hole does not fit, it is too small. I called and sent pictures with measurements to Beck Arnley and they agreed it was defective. I returned item back and received replacement, same thing. I called Beck Arnley again. This time they checked 60 units that were in their warehouse and found only one with the correct measurements. The part number on the Drum is an old part number that has been superceeded with a correct fitting drum from the isuzu manufacturer."
3,Not so well organized phrasebook,"Bought this phrasebook because I like the LP travel guides. It turns out being good in one does not guarantee you're good in the other. The organization of ""situations"" in which you need pecific words is not very logical and the priority given to various phrases is also odd. In the restaurant and caf√© section I missed several basis phrases. In the restaurant mini-dictionary following phrases the situation was similar. I ended up not using this book and instead used my 20 year old portuguese-english mini dictionary. One of the vacations in which I learned the least about the local language."
4,good buy,"good book, does just what it says it does. Not to learn the language, but great for traveling and quick reference."
5,Excellent work of Carol Anthony,"For those who follow the I Ching is fundamental to have the Book of Changes by Richard Welhelm, but not always are easy the interpretations and this book by Carol K. Anthony is an extraordinary support for its interpretation and I commend her work"
2,Run Small,"I liked the look of the shoe and I have owned other Bite shoes. This model ran small, so I had to return it."
1,lite golf shoe,nice shoe. A little tight in the width (the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars) Very confortable.
5,"Simple, practical watch",The time-of-day is readable and day of the week and date functions are useful. It is reasonably easy to set. The watch is light on my wrist and unobtrustive to me.
2,Crappy little watch,"I thought I was ordering the Casio that I'd recently lost, but this one is more suitable for a child or adolescent. It's thin and small, and the buttons stick out to where if you bump it at all, the next thing you know it's in a different mode or changing time or date. What I ended up doing with this thing is pulling off the wrist band halves and use keep it in my waist pouch for when I go on walks. As I'm one of those odd fellows who intentionally lives without a cell phone, I still need a watch but this one isn't what I'd hoped for.What I'll likely end up doing is ordering another Casio but a more deluxe model that fits my wrist. I miss the Casio I'd lost as it was an excellent, durable watch."
4,Great Watch - Tiny Strap,"I've had a few F91W series watches, and they've all been reliable. They're so inexpensive, and run so long on the original batteries, they're pretty much disposable. I don't wear a watch on my wrist, but strap them to my backpack. Just to try it out, though, I put my new F91W-1 watch on my wrist... Or, rather, I ~tried~ to put it onto my wrist, but it didn't fit. I'm not Lou Ferigno or The Big Show, and I could barely touch the tip of the strap to the very tip of the buckle. I compared it to my older F91W, and it too had a small strap. A no-name watch from Hong Kong with another ""standard men's strap"" was a good centimeter longer. It's not a problem for me, since I don't plan on wearing it, but it's something to keep in mind when purchasing this watch. As a timepiece, the F91W-1 still great. Accurate, rugged, water resistant, inexpensive and very plain looking. I'll trust my life to it as a timepiece, but apparently I won't be wearing it unless I buy a new strap."
5,"Simple, Dependable Watch","The Casio F91W is a great watch. It is very accurate and durable. The screen resists scratches well. For its design and dependability, I give this 5 stars.Only feature I wish it has was a timer. It has an alarm, which can double as a timer, but it's not quite the same.Oh, and watch out for imitators. On Ebay some people are selling a knock off of this watch. It looks very similar, but just google ""f91w knock off"" and you'll find of plenty of information. It is definitely worth buying this one from Amazon so you know that you have the real one."
3,Watch works,"For 10 dollars, I can tell time without looking at my cell phone :-) Casio watch is functional. So far, so good. Wrist band should be a little longer, though (people with thick wrists may have a problem with this model)."
2,Good cheap watch.....but,"I have owned Casio watches for years. They are low-priced and accurate, but the last two have broken. The supports that hold the band break off so you are left with a pocket watch. If they could make the plastic a little stronger I would be well satisfied with the product."
4,Solid Watch,"Received this watch a few weeks ago and I am happy with it. I previously had many watches like this growing up so there is a nostalgia factor. I have other more expensive watches but find myself wearing this a lot.PROS: Cheap, durable, no frills simple watch.CONS: the light function isn't very bright but will get the job done in the dark (and even low light). My previous one had a metal clasp (thing you fasten the band with) with the rubber band, this had a black plastic one, but its not a big deal."
4,Good value,"A very nice watch: light-weight, simple and accurate. Dial light could be a bit brighter, but it is not too bad. One thing I did not realiize prior to purchase: the instructions state the watch is merely water resistant and should not be use for swimming. Still, I am happy with the purchase."
2,Do not use in water,"This watch should not be worn in water. I used it in a swimming pool twice and it got moisture inside and stopped working. I had a previous version of this watch for several years which was very water resistant and I had no problem with it, but I would not purchase the current version again."
3,Casio Timer,"Compact, precise and reliable. Great for gym work and affordable. I wanted something for my excercise regime and also to mark time. This simple three function watch serves both purposes. I am pleased with the product."
4,"Simple, Classy and Unpretentious","The watch is simple and unpretentious yet elegant in its own way. A much smaller watch by contemporary standards - its small size takes a while to get use to. All the basic features - time, calendar, alarm, stop watch, back light - are easily accessible. The backlight though adequate looks is very primitive and gives the watch a very old feel; replace it with an indiglo and we might have a 5 star rating."
5,"Simple, cheap, durable","Nice watch. Slim, easy to read, unpretentious, and tough enough to withstand weekend activities like yard work, painting, or an occasional dip in the pool. It's about the same prices as those cheesy plastic monstrosities you see by the dozens at big box stores, but much better made."
4,Great watch for a great price,"I picked this old school watch up right before a military deployment. I wanted something cheap, that I don't care what happens to it. This fits the bill.Pro Cheap, lightweight, has a stop watch and alarmCon: the backlight is kind of crap and it only has 1 time zone.Worth the buy if you don't care about the style (or like the retro) and you need something to just tell the time."
4,Great Value for Price,Its very simple to use and set up. The only downside for me is that the band could be a bit longer.
4,Plain vanilla and cheap,"No guilt and no pretentions, but this watch requires no eye disease to see it in low light. Has all the basic functions, is slim on the wrist, and easy on the wallet. The perfect timepiece when impression is not a factor."
5,I love this watch!,I bought this watch over four years ago and haven't had any need yet to replace any parts. I am in the military and it fits perfectly underneath the sleeve of my uniform. The watch wears light and is so affordable and durable that I never have to worry about losing it or breaking it on accident. I have never gotten it wet so I can't attest to its water resistance.
5,Classic simplicity,Great for small to mid size wrists. Very comfortable. Classic retro style. Amazing that something so inexpensive functions so perfectly. Still a winner 30 years after its debut.
2,No what I expected,"I thought this watch was the ""normal"" Casio with 4 buttons (two on each side); however, the watch only has three buttons making the watch more difficult to set and use than I thought. I returned it and will look for the traditional 4-button model."
5,Excellent watch for the money.,"For less than nine dollars, Casio Men's F91W-1 black digital offers excellent functionality and amazing durability. My first casio watch was in the form of one of their cheaper casual watches. It unfortunately broke at work. I purchased this watch and have already developed a favorable impression of it. Changing time, date, day, etc was simple. There is also a stopwatch function and a alarm if I wanted to set it."
2,Pain in the rear end,"It is impossible to pull the band back to get the peg out and take the watch off. I think the band will be gone in a few months because of how hard I have to pull to get it off. Also, the ""night light"" is terrible and doesn't illuminate well at all. And the main ink display isn't dark enough. Sometimes I have to squint in broad daylight to see the timeTwo stars for being nonetheless inexpensive and disposable."
5,Exceeded expectations,"Simple to set time, date etc..it exceeded expectations..this is a great watch..it has all the gadgets associated with adigital watch(which I'll never use) all I wanted was a simple to set, time,date,day that I could do without whipping out the user guide nor have the other functions interfering with my basic needs"
4,Casio Watch,"These little Casio Watches are great. I was a schoolteacher for many years and I used the timer function for math quizzes for several years without ever needing a new watch. To the chagrin of many students the watch timer never quit!The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the wristband is pretty cheapo and small... than again, probably not many adults buy this one."
5,Best inexpensive watch PERIOD!,"I have worn these Casio watches for over 30 years. Sometimes difficult to source locally. An illuminated version for less than $11.00. Fantastic. I've spent that on watch bands in the past but none were as comfortable as what is furnished with this watch! The bands on the Casio watches in the past failed before the watch. Buy one of these for less than the average cost of a less comfortable band alone. A superb value on a VERY accurate watch! Water RESISTANT, not water proof."
5,Great Watch - Perfect for surfing,"There is no need to spend $50+. Perfect for surfing: never had any problem on water, its small and light, and it's a Casio."
2,Worked great for a while,"The watch worked great for a while. After 3 months, however, the backlight button failed. This button also has a number of other functions, such as helping set the time and resetting the stopwatch, making it hard to use."
4,Nice watch,The only negative I can find with the watch is the length of the band. Needs to be about an inch or so longer. Otherwise it's perfect.
4,Good for timing rest times for workouts,I bought this because it had a stopwatch feature that I needed to time my rests between sets. It gets the job done. Reason for 4 stars and not 5 isn't because I don't like but because I saw another digital watch at Walmart the other day that was only $6.
2,Not As Described,"This watch is not ""Water-resistant to 165 feet (50 M)"". It should be removed every time you wash your hands. Other similar models have the 50-M rating for a couple dollars more. I complained to the seller, but they said the incorrect description was not their fault."
4,Great Watch at an Even Better Price,"I had this watch when I was much younger; I loved it then and I love it now. Durable, water resistant much deeper than I care to be in water, classic look, and very inexpensive. In addition to the water resistance, it has alarm with different ring settings, stop watch, day of the week and date display, and light. The light is a little weak and over years of use, the band can rip, but so inexpensive to replace and you can turn into a clip on watch if the band breaks. Love this watch."
1,Too small,I thought the watch would be bigger than it is and I just opened it today and it was so small. What a joke. This watch is pathetic.
5,Only watch I'll ever buy,"I got this watch as a gift when I was a kid and now it is the only kind of watch I ever buy. Any time it gets lost or breaks I always seek the exact same one out. I have a friend who is the same way about another Casio watch. It's just so simple and intuitive, and it does everything you need, there's no need to spend more."
4,nice watch!,"good watch, does exactly what i want to to do. back light could be better but it was only 10 bucks."
3,"Solid, Basic, Political, Small","To tell the truth I got this watch when I read about it being the sole reason some people have been held indefinitely in guantanimo. It'sone of the most commonly sold an used watches on the planet and somehow owning it is an indicator of guilt?Anyway... it's a very basic watch, it tells you the date and time, has an alarm, a stopwatch, a backlight... everything you really need. The only thing that makes me ding it down a couple stars is the band size. I'm not an overly large man and I have to wear it on the last hole which is a little fiddly and makes the very end stick out and catch on things. I usually end up just tossing it in my pocket."
5,"Excellent watch -- dependable, long lasting -- great for nurses","I've had this watch over 15 years, close to 20. A long time. I bought it at Targ*t. I had it in college, nursing school, wore it when I started my first job on night shift and it is still going strong. It is a super watch. It is a great watch for nursing. The light works well in dark rooms, the alarm is easy to set, the watch is waterproof for all those hand washings! I also always wore it in the pool- no problems. I think I've had to change the battery and band only once. Sturdy, good quality."
5,This Is How I Identify My Fellow Operatives,"I received this watch as a gift after completing, ah, shall we say, a technical course with some guys from my church. At first I was nonplussed, since I had hoped my eternal reward would include a tourbillion complication, but I grew used to the idea of quartz timekeeping in the afterlife.Pros: easy to spot when wandering around NYCCons: strap melts under extreme heat."
4,Great basic watch,What a great watch. Everything about it is great except for the band. I heard that some peoples band would wear out in 2 years and from a review a guy is going on his 11th year without the band breaking on him and he was trying to wear out the watch to see how long he can make it last but failed to do so. My opinion is that the band is fine and can last as long as the watch. But at the price it really dont matter. You can always get a better band and attach it to this watch and have this watch for 7-10 years. Very slim and unnoticable that you have it on. Swim and shower with it. A must buy definetly. Forget about those bulk G-shock watches. all anyone needs is the time. Casuals are always best. Especially this watch.
4,watch,"It is thin but I would like a few more features, which I can get with a more expensive watch. I am pleased"
5,Good Old watch,My wife liked it so much she took it from me. Now I have to buy another one. And keep it away from her.
3,Close but found a product which works better for cook tops,"I was a faithful fan of Weimans before I foundBar Keepers Friend Cookware Cleanser & Polish: 12 OZ. I loved the gentle cleaning and the polish I got from Weimans but hated how it wouldn't remove stubborn stains. At first, I was reluctant to try another product but my black cook top shows everything so I went with the product above. No scratches, no stains, less work - how could I possibly go back to Weimans after that? Maybe my ceramic cooktop is especially hard to clean but it simply doesn't do the job for me."
5,Tascam recorder,"I traded a power amplifier for this CD recorder. I use CD-RW in it and it records great!The description said for people on a budget. For a ""budget"" item It feels, looks and operates like pro grade rack gear. Execelent quality and price (from what I see) I definitely would get this if you are on a budget."
4,Feel Good Movie,Good cast and beautiful scenery in this cute love story. Keeps the interest going and gets you involved in wondering what the characters are going to do next.
1,Why?,The movie was good on TV but why is the DVD $44????? This is a ridiculously high price for a DVD.
5,This video is excellent,The language was very good. The story was realistic. It provided a good feeling that life can be meaningful. The photography was excellent and beautiful.
5,A sweet romantic story,"This is a bittersweet romantic story without all the sex and foul language in the big screen movies today. The scenery is beautiful, it's a good story about overcoming losses and love wins in the end!"
4,Straight from the Heart,The scenery in this movie is breath-taking. Nice to see Andrew McCarthy all grown up. The story is a nice break from too much blood and guts and action going on these days. Chick Flick
3,Straight from the Heart,"It was wounderful seeing Andrew McCarthy in a role that didn't involve highschool or teenagers. He's all grown up and he looks great on a horse.The movie however, fell short of the mark. The chemistry between McCarthy and Kalember wasn't strong. What makes a good romantic movie into a great romantic movie are several elements. The couple has to overcome several odds to be together. One being emotional distance, that was apparent, especially in McCarthy's character, the other would be a physical rival for the affections of one or both of the main characters. Greg Evigan tried to play that role, but he was barely on the screen, therefore, his character was not used effectively and lastly, strong physical desire. With McCarthy's character constently trying to keep his distance from Kalember's character, the physical part was not that obvious.Too bad. It had the makings of a great love story, if only they developed the script a little better."
4,Straight From the Heart,"I found it enteraining and relaxing to watch, I like that it was clean and all my family would not be embarassed to watch it."
4,An Overall Good Movie,"Somehow I never got to see the whole story on the Hallmark channel, so I wanted my own copy as I really liked the story, the actors, and the scenery. I was a bit taken aback by the dialogue between the two main characters when they first met, but the writers had their own ideas, I guess. I'd watch it with my grandchildren."
5,Don't Miss this Wonderful Love Story!,"WONDERFUL love story! My favorite! I've played it numerous times for the story, the scenery, the country appeal, and the magic! MUST SEE!"
3,Cursing devalues Hallmark movies.,"I'm very disappointed that Hallmark is compromising their values. Cursing, regardless of how minor, has absolutely no place in a Hallmark family movie. If there is any cursing in a movie, it should have a rating other than NR. Otherwise, this could've been a beautiful family movie, and I would've given it a 5-star rating."
4,Straight from the Heart movie,"The movie is excellent and is a great, very enjoyable story. We enjoy it every time we watch it and it is nice to have a copy to watch. We have seen it on TV several times, however, it has not been played on TV for a couple or so years. It was nice to finally find a copy. However, the movie we got is not in High Definition (HD) which makes the people and some things look wider. Wish we could get the movie in HD, but since it is an older production, don't know if that is available???"
5,Sweet little movie,"Nature in Wyoming, horses, a simple but moving story told with a wholesomeness too seldom seen today. This is good. I saw it originally on the Hallmark channel and have been trying to find it since. Thank you, Amazon.com!"
3,Charming Love Story,"Cute movie. The male character was not very developed, or the actor couldn't pull it off so I couldn't give more than 3 stars. Great story, sweet loving message."
3,Disappointed in language,"This was a good story, and fairly good acting for a low cost production movie. However, it is not totally clean of foul language. I realize some consider other swear words worse than others...I don't like any. I ended up throwing this one out instead of adding it to my collection because of the language."
2,Mild Profanity and Non-Family Values,I bought this movie based on the rave customer reviews. This definitely isn't a family-friendly or moral story. The lead actress is from New York and is proposed to move in with her long time boyfriend. The only reason she doesn't like the idea is because she wants a greater commitment (marriage) but not because she feels moving in is wrong. Also a friend encourages her to lie non-chalantly at one point when she feels out of place in Wyoming. We bought the movie on the pretense that there were no cuss words but H*** and D*** were sprinkled throughout the movie and only took away from what could've been a decent film. Even outside of the non-family values and cursing it was slow moving.
2,Shallow,"I barely tolerated this movie. The storyline is too shallow and predictable. I gave this DVD away, too stupid to keep."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting a story of considerably better quality. I should have known to avoid DVDs where the 'scenery' and 'photography' are described more positively than the script, characters and quality of the viewing experience. Certainly not worth ordering all the way from New Zealand! I imagine this would appeal to the over 60s age group. Better to spend your time on a classic film like 'Map of the Human Heart'."
5,I can do it because of this book.,"I got this book and opened it right away. I skipped to the chapter on downlow and coming out. It made me feel a lot better. I didn't come out yet, but I will, because it tells me how to do it safely, and with a backup plan. This book helped me a lot."
5,High Quality Instrument Cable,I needed a dependable cable to use with my base and practice amp. This is it. I've been using it since November 2007 and have not experienced any problems. I highly recommend this cable.
1,Died after 5th use,"I was warned about Monster Cable Quality, but didn't listen... The right angle connector failed after the 5th use. Very weak assembly. Will probably chop the ends and put on my own quality plug. Not worth the hassle to return..."
5,What Can You Say,"It may not be top of the line but, a great product for the price range. I have much better cables but they cost twice as much. The AMAZON price gives you a very good quality item for the price of an average product. The name Monster has always been associated with great electronics accy."
2,poorly made,"Kids enjoy it, but poorly made. Fabric not sewn on well and thin. Don't expect to last more than 6 months without being totally torn."
5,Super toy!!,"I bought this for my 3 young cats and they LOVE it!!! It's made well, super easy to assemble and disassemble, versatile too. Sometimes I lay the tunnels out in different areas of the yard. I'm guessing young kids would love it too."
5,Just gorgeous!!,This platter is not only beautiful but practical. It is so elegant. The Lenox Paradigm serving pieces definitely get noticed. I was lucky enough to order the three pieces at a great price. The style is simple enough to blend with any china patern and is bold enough to stand on it's own and get noticed.
4,Fisher is in top form but...,"unfortunately the sound quality is a major disappointment. Though the recording is in stereo, Fisher's voice is poorly balanced and the orchestra sounds thin, tinny and distant. A shame too since his voice is so well suited to the Broadway selections offered. I first became aware of Fisher when a friend played me his ""Eddie Fisher at the Winter Garden"" album which I truly enjoyed. Since then I've added several of his CD's to my collection. But even his early monaural recordings on the Jasmine label sound better than this CD. Other Fisher CD's I'd highly recommend are those released on the Collectables label featuring ""two LP's on one CD"" (often with extra bonus tracks). I'm giving this CD four stars as not to diminish Fisher's talent but only for that reason."
3,Loving Sex - Passion 3 DVD,""" Well I was expecting some very natural love scenes, infact there were some of them in ""What women wants"" and ""What men wants"" but In ""ultimate sex massage"" it was simply waste of money. Well for learning aspect its very nice to watch in couple.""Ultimately one sentence can define this better"" Overpromised underdeliver about this DVD"""
2,Commercial disappointment,"I am disappointed with the ""Beat Club"" videos on this DVD. The quality of them is disappointing, meaning that there is more black than white in these videos. These videos need to be brightened up for better viewing. Whatever happened to the dial of ""bright"" on the TV? It is gone, and there is no way of brightening up these videos.On a lighter side, I like the pop-ups that tell the story of the band."
5,True,"Plain and simple this isn't something your local record company packaged and sent on it's merry way, this is purely loud and angry. A must for all fans of heavier music."
1,Terrible,How can anyone listen to this music...theyres no creativity in it...the music on the cd is so worthless that this page should be deleted...never buy this cd...if you like anything even close to this genre just go and by a marilyn manson cd...where there actully is some curiousity and creativity...somthing very important to music thats been lost here. Stay away From This Band and do yourself and music a favor in the proscess
2,Too much B-complex,"It doesn't work well for me, because after take one i felt a terrible headache and neckache."
1,AVOID BY ALL MEANS!,"One of the worst films I have ever seen.No plot, no sense, stupid dialogues.This one made me almost fall asleep in the middle of the day."
4,This Book Answers Questions For The Curious,"Very Interesting! This book examines some of the lesser know religious faiths and rituals such as Shakers, Doukhobors, Hutterites, Voodooism, Baalism and others."
5,A definite page turner!,"I absolutely loved this book. Romance, drama, humor, suspense, this book has it all. You can't put it down, because you're always wanting to know what will happen next. The characters are so realistic that you almost expect to turn on the radio and hear Serenity's latest single! Tony is my favorite, and I feel like I could get to know him very well. A lot of time and effort went into this book, and it shows. Viva Maura!"
1,NOT Chris Connor,"I just want to make it clear to customers and editors alike that Chris O'Connor is NOT the female jazz singer Chris Connor, who was popular in the 50s and was a protegee of June Christy. I haven't listened to Holler, so I'll just give it one star (sorry Chris O'Connor!), but I hope customers won't buy this thinking they are getting Chris Connor, because these are TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE!"
4,Good Rock,"Wonderful! It's nice to hear some good rock for a change. Not too heavy, not too light. I've already recommended it to some friends. Good full sound. Sounds like ""Yes"" may be one of their influences."
1,Buy something else,Piece of garbage. The glass thermometer slides along the temperature scale so you have no idea what the real temperature is. Tap the thermometer on one end or the other and the reading can change by up to 14 degrees! Don't waste your money.
4,Where's The Rest Of Ed?,"Frankly, this disc scares the bejeebers out of me. Because, in spite of this being advertised in all the retail markets as Season 1, Volume 1, it's no such thing; it's just six disparate episodes from seasons 1 and 2. The DVD is labeled Volume 1, which suggests there will be future volumes. But I have this ugly, unpleasant suspicion it will turn out just like the Powerpuff Girls: a few more discs with randomly chosen episodes, then quitsville. So, four stars for content--this DVD has two of my all-time favorite Ed-isodes, and the rest are all great also-rans--and a plea to Cartoon Network: Come on, just release the whole series on DVD alrEDy! And while you're at it, give us the rest of the Powerpuff Girls. And how about Dexter's Lab? And...?"
3,Somewhat deceiving...,"Don't get me wrong, it contains some classic episodes, all episodes are of course funny, however... 3 out of 6 episodes on this disc are also included on ""Ed Edd n Eddy complete 2nd season"""
2,"Funny cartoon, poor DVD.","Ed, Edd n' Eddy has been one of my favorite shows since it first aired back in 1999(?). But this DVD does not do the series justice. You only get six episodes! Why can't they just give us entire seasons on DVD? To make matters worse, the particular copy I purchased (from Target, not Amazon) was defective."
4,THE ED BOYS HIT YOU DVD PLAYER,"FINALLY THE EDD,S ARE ON DVD. I AM A BIG FAN. THE SESSON 3 NOW IS GREAT AND THE OLDIES MUST BE PURE GOLD. I SEEN EVERY EPISOD.(I THINK?) I DONT HAVE IT YET BUT BY THE RATE OF THE SHOW IT SELF. I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE A KICK ASS DVD FOR ALL FANS. THE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE IS THAT THEY COME IN VOLUMES. WHY CANT THEY JUST RELEASE THEM ALL AT ONCE. LIKE CRANK YANKERS SESSON 1 AND ALL THE SIMPSONS DVD,S DID. IM A LITTLE STEEMED BUT IT IS GUNNA BE A GREAT DVD. GET REDDY FOR SCAM PULLING, JAW BREACKER SUCKING, AND KANKER SISTER AVOIDING COMIDY OF THE EDS. THIS IS A DVD FOR ALL. SO GET THE DVD IM GIVING THE ED,S A 4 OUT OF 5. SORRY TO BREAK THE ALL 5 STARS STREAK. RELEASE ALL EPISODES AT ONCE NEXT TIME.p.s ED,EDD,ANDEDDY RULE. GO EDD BOYS GO. :) :) :)"
3,"Cartoon Funny, DVD a let down","The show is great, but the dvd gives you 6 ""episodes,"" but it's really 15 minute shows, so it amounts to 3 episodes. And they aren't even the first 3 that were made, it's random episodes from the first season. Since the complete first season has been releasted, this dvd isn't worth it."
1,A DVD FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO HATE,"I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS YET BUT, I AM DOING IT JUST TO WARN YOU.FROM THE BEGINNING THESE ED, EDD 'N EDDY EPISODES TOOK EVERY JOKE TOO FAR THERE WOULD BE SOMTHING FUNNY BUT, THEY WOULD KEEP GOING UNTIL THE JOKE WAD DEAD. THROW THIS ONE IN THE TRASH, (...). TAKE MY WORD FOR IT DON'T EVEN VIEW THIS DVD."
1,A DVD FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO HATE,"I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS YET BUT, I AM DOING IT JUST TO WARN YOU.FROM THE BEGINNING THESE ED, EDD 'N EDDY EPISODES TOOK EVERY JOKE TOO FAR THERE WOULD BE SOMTHING FUNNY BUT, THEY WOULD KEEP GOING UNTIL THE JOKE WAD DEAD. THROW THIS ONE IN THE TRASH, WATCH HANKY PANKY HULLABALOO INSEAD. TAKE MY WORD FOR IT DON'T EVEN VIEW THIS DVD."
5,"Finally Ed, Edd, and Eddy on DVD!!!!!!!!!","Everyone of the Ed, edd, and eddy episodes are entertaining and hilarious to watch. I know even without seeing this DVD, that it will be worth it. I have probably seen every episode, but ever since I watched this show I knew I wanted the entire serious. I cannot wait until the rest of the episodes come out to buy, because I will be first in line to purchase them. I have been waiting a long time for this to come."
5,"Bec-de Corbins, Ear-spoons, and atlatls...OH MY!","Humans are strange creatures. Other species fight to the death over mates, food, and territory, it's certain; but only man has raised the battle to such an artform. From the earliest, simplest clubs, to modern chemical and biological weaponry, this book chronicles the tools of war and self-defense throughout most of known history. With hundreds, maybe even thousands of illustrations, this is the definitive reference on all the creative ways we invent to kill eachother. Keep your langdebeve handy!"
2,Review of Photoshop CS A complete course,A comprehensive book about learning photoshop.Suitable for beginner to competent user of photoshop. Be aware the CD with the book will not work with Windows 7. A pity it has not been updated. Overall a very good learning tool
2,Find another one,"If you are serious about photoshop capability on color management, filters, layers, everything, look somewhere else!!! I bought this book together with Photoshop CS One-on-one from Deke McClelland, I spend 95% of time with Deke, better approach, better illustration. If you have spare money, buy it to fill up your shelf. Otherwise, save your money for a beer."
1,Guelalaguetza de los 60's una joya,"The video came out blurry I would like to return the video. When I was viewing the video it was very hard to see what was happening because of the tracking, I did fix my tracking but I believe it's the video."
1,Can't put it together!,We have tried putting this together several ways and can't seem to get it right. We have read the instructions over and over and it shouldn't be this hard. Any suggestions from other users?? It says to use 4 poles on the bottom and then the top...this makes it smaller than the actual tent. It's also confusing because they actually sent 12 poles for the top and bottom instead of eight. HELP!! I left a message with Pacific Playtents but no response yet.
4,Wonderful Kleypas! Sweetly charming,"Sometimes you just need to read a book that makes you feel warm and happy inside-this book is it. The characters were wonderful and charming, while the plot kept the book moving. I was sorry to get to the end."
4,First Bow Street Runner Novel,'Someone to Watch over Me' was a predictable novel but a great start the series. Grant Morgan finds Vivien (a high-priced prostitute) half dead and decided to solve or attempted murder and seek revenge as well. Some great twist - pick up the whole series and enjoy; Someone To Watch Over Me (1) Lady Sophia's Lover (2) and Worth Any Price (3rd and my favorite).
5,Brilliant as usual!!,"Sigh....Yet another excellent book from Lisa! She is one of the few authors that can capture the male point-of-view so eloquently.I was so in love with Grant that I didn't want the story to end. It was the perfect amount of chemistry and sexual tension between the characters.I highly recommend this book and also ""Lady Sophia's Lover"". In that book we read about Sir Ross Cannon. I don't know which one was better!"
1,Too Stupid for Words,"Im an avid reader, and I""m not snobby with my reading material. However, this book was stupid on a number of levels. First, what woman would allow herself to be put in a position where she can be left for dead in a river? Also, the heroine had no backbone and was a doormat to the hero. The characters were cookie cutter, the plot didn't make me want to read the book. Pretty blah, as far as I""m concerned."
1,Dreadful,I found this book too cliche for words. The fact that it was poorly written with weak character build-up/descriptions/relationships only added to the drudgery. Don't waste your time.
5,Give yourselves a break!,"Firstly, if you guys can let a little, tiny, minute detail like salt water bog you down for the whole book, you are spending WAY too much time obsessing on adjectives and such. Sit back and enjoy the book! It's an extremely charming story that can touch hearts. The heroine was adorable, as well as admirable, and the hero was VERY likeable. (Very typical of Kleypas!)P.S. Don't you think there could be salt water in the Thames? London, after all, is a port directly on the sea..."
2,thickheaded hero,"Yuck. One of the worst Lisa Kleypas books so far, at least for me. I am surprised as L.Kleypas is definitely one of my favourite authors (her Wallflower series and some of her Hathaways are my all-time favourite romances). But this book was...well, dull, cheesy, unbelievable.I mean, how stupid could the main hero possibly be. I put two and two together waaaaay before he did and he is supposed to be a smart guy. And he didn't even think about the possibility that the heroine talked true. I was so frustrated with him, what a thickheaded bore he was. I am glad I read the sequel Lady Sophia's Lover before this book as I liked it much better."
4,Typical Ms Kleypas fair (in a good way.),"When Grant pulls a 'bloater' from the Thames, he is shocked to find the woman is still alive. But when he recognises the near drowned woman as the infamous courtesan, Vivian, a woman who once humiliated him in public, he has a novel idea for revenge.This book is an intriguing read and fairly standard Ms Kleypas fair. As ever the author can be relied upon to provide great characters with sexual tension and a satisfying plot. One or two glitches spoilt the read for me (such as 'electricity' between the H/h - which considering this is a historical was a little out of place) but it wont stop me seeking out other books in this series."
4,Someone to watch over me,Very nice twist of the story. A must read book. Lisa Kleypas is a very good story teller. She is one of my favorite author.
5,Someone to Watch Over Me,I enjoyed this book because I felt like it was not predictable. It kept me interested and wanting to read more each time I picked it up to read! :)
2,booooring,"SPOILER ALERTNormally a huge Kleypas fan but this one wasn't great. I was disappointed, though not at all suprised, that the lady in question turned out not to be a prostitute.I think the book and the characters could have had a lot more depth if she had gone the other way. We could have discovered the reason she had become a prostitute and gone through his struggle to come to terms with her past. It would have at least been more interesting than the typical shy virgin being seduced by the worldly and virile rake. Why can't the girls ever be bad?"
4,Don't Be Fooled!!!!,"...I figured it would make for a unique twist to read about a heroine who wasn't your typical run of the mill ""beauty"" with legs that reach from sunup to sundown and a body to die for. Well, hello!!!! The book repeatedly describes her as petite, tiny, small, childlike, etc. etc. When she walks into a room every man ""instantly desire's"" her. She's the most famous courtesan in the whole country. She's not plain, she's not plump and while her legs are described as short once or twice the rest of her is absolutely perfect. As usual. Having said all that, it's still a good read. Just don't go into it looking for someone other than your typical perfect heroine. If you do, you will be sadly disappointed."
5,Almost perfect,"This is probably the best book Kleypas has ever written. If you've never read her before start here. The characters are so clearly written, the dialogue sparkles. The only real problem is the villian could be stronger and it wrapped up a little too quickly. You won't be disappointed."
4,"The plot is familiar, but the story is terrific.","It doesn't take long to solve the mystery of the story for yourself. It is not an uncommon theme. However, I still found myself glued to the book.The writing is excellent. The characters are vivid and realistic, not the perfect bodies and flawless faces that we so often read about.The story moves and keeps you interested. It is exciting enough to have you on the edge of your seat at times. Then at other times it becomes endearing enough to make you mushy inside. At still at other times, it is fun enough to make you smile. (""Chopper"", the moody cat, is one good source of humor.)Terrific love scenes. Daring and steamy.This was my first Lisa Kleypas novel as well. I will look for more of her work in the future."
4,someone to watch over me- enchanting!,"Lisa Kleypas has done a magnificent job with this book. The most prestigous bow street runner, finds himself in a tangled web of attempted murder. The victom is a self center, manipulitive, and notorious harlot. Who wakes up in Grants bed, with no memory of who she is. Grant is angry by his sudden attraction to vivien. But is it really her. I guarentee you love this book. Its charming, and warms your heart."
2,A bit too predictable for me....,"Although I like Ms. Kleypas' earlier works, I have to say this book just didn't rate... It was too predictable for me and I felt it was a bit petty for Grant to go through such lengths to get Vivian back for her earlier deeds. The chemistry just wasn't there and it felt a little unrealistic.For a taste of Ms. Kleypas' works, I highly suggest the ""You"" series."
3,Just Okay for Me,"I have only recently begun reading Lisa Kleypas's work and I have really enjoyed what I had read, so when I came across a discussion thread of readers favorite Kleypas books and this on was mentioned I had to read it. While I thought it was okay it was not great. I never really got a good sense of the world in which the main characters inhabit. It was made clear they were on the fringes of high society but not really a part of it and I would have been interested to understand more about that, especially what would motivate a woman to become a courtesan who was clearly not from an entirely impoverished background. Another detraction is that the book is incredibly predictable after the first 50 pages you can already guess the entire story."
4,This romance did not disappoint!,"Grant Morgan is a sexy, larger-than-life (and larger-than-average) man. He is confident, collected, and a little bit dangerous.Vivien is sweetly innocent as an amnesiac who was nearly strangled to death and drowned in the Thames.The mistaken identity storyline is interesting and Lisa Kleypas never disappoints with her great characters and easy writing style.I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great romance."
2,First from this author,"Started reading this a couple of days ago after reading all the reviews, I just do not like it and probably will not even finish reading it. I've read almost 200 pages so far. This is the first book from this author that I've tried to read."
4,Solid Kleypas,"As usual, Ms. Kleypas' characters are fascinating and well developed. The story is thoroughly absorbing. You immediately care about both protagonists and want them to fall in love.My measure of a great author is when I actually (almost physically) feel the emotions as the characters do. Ms. Kleypas definitely allows her readers to experience that here, from humiliation to ecstasy to fear, back to ecstasy.Along with the highly sensual romance, there's the mystery of who tried to kill Vivian, making this a completely engrossing read. I wasn't able to put it down!!"
4,Sweet and enjoyable,"This book is a light, enjoyable read, perfect for one of those lazy days of summer when you're just relaxing. The characters are engaging and well-developed, even if they're just minor ones in the background. Kleypas also does a good job of keeping the sexual tension up, but not overt. Trying to unravel the mystery is definitely part of the fun - as are reading through some of the steamier scenes. All-in-all, fairly well-written and enjoyable all around."
4,"After reading this book, I wanted more of her stories!","Lisa's stories show the heroine as much more than weak-willed women like other historical romances. They are the kind of characters you hope were around in those days. She gives them looks, brains and independence! This story is a good test of wills that leaves you feeling good about the characters and their lives."
2,ok but nothing special,Well I was a bit disappointed by this story. I have liked Lisa Kelypas' books in the past but this one while it had a sweet heroine and and strong devoted hero bored me. It seemed like the mystery never really developed and the excitement was over very quickly. There wasn't much passion which is ok because I liked the tender love scenes. It just seemed a bit lacking so it took me several days to read. I wish it had been better.
3,The Last Cowboy,"Not a bad story, but needed more plotline. Acting was good, but story jumped around and it was like the director couldn't decide on a plot line - love story, last cowboy, etc."
4,The Last Cowboy,"I enjoyed the movie very much even though it was not exactly what I thought it would be. Return time was speedy, overall experience ver good."
1,Disappointed,The language in this movie was very inappropriate for family viewing and I would not recommend it to anyone. I did not watch the entire movie because it never seemed to get any better.
3,"Great story, but...","I loved the story here and the emphasis on trust in relationships - both with horses and people, but the language really spoiled what could have been a perfect family movie. It really took the enjoyment out of it for me, because there was no need for bad language in a movie like this. I was really disappointed in that."
2,I was hoping this would be a good movie,"I generally like these types of movies, and was hoping to like this one as well. This didn't happen for me. The story line was too predictable and not a lot of believable emotion on the actors part. I wouldn't recommend this movie for others to watch. This is one of the very few poor reviews I have written."
2,bad language,This would have been a good movie it they would have left out the language. We didn't make it to the end of the movie to see how many foul words were used and the extremitity of the language. I wanted a movie with a good plot but without the language no matter how mild to some. It would have been a good movie it the language was left off.
2,Luke Warm,The movie was only fair in my opinion. Thats because the writer could have done so much more with this concept. Only worth watching because of the job the actors do in it. Storyline borders on boring.
5,The Last Cowboy dvd,"Did receive this item in good time and in good condition. Unfortunately, my dvd player has been broken and I have not been able to watch it yet."
2,Boring movie,"It's been a long time since I bought a movie and read a magazine through the whole thing. Slow moving, story line could have been a lot better and acting too."
1,"I have usually found the ""all the best of..."" cd's to be ""","a good start on world music, but I have to ask what the heck was on the Italy disc. I'm getting ready to major in Italian in college and was hoping to have some ""theme"" music for studying. Imagine my surprise when all but about 4 songs are horribly-made 80's imitations! I imagine this is an insult for people of Italian heritage, and it certainly is an earache for the rest of us! There is only about 4 (1 one of the new songs are semi-ok) songs I care for off the whole thing, and I just wasted 12 dollars of my weekly pay! They should have a warning on the label!"
1,Poor Imitations,Disappointing! These are not original recordings but poor imitations by lounge lizards. Don't waste you money.
4,Pretty good music,"My husband(who is Italian), and I listen to this often...especially in the car. I think it is a great buy for the number of songs you get. Also, the quality of the music is pretty good for the price as well. Afterall, it's not like you are buying Bocelli....So given what it is...remakes of popular songs... I say this music is ""Pretty Good Music"" for a great price."
1,All The Best of Italy: 40 Italian Favorites,This was a total waste of money! This had to be the cheesiest Italian recordings that I have ever heard. Don't bother.
4,nice music overall,"For those who have grown up on some of these italian hits, it will be a great moment of joy to hear them. No tricks, just plain old recordings are found on the cd, i.e. no re-interpretation, or new arrangement."
5,One of the best collection of Italian songs,"I don't really know why such harsh reviews for this album. This is the quintessential album of Italian classics from the 70's and 80's that anyone who enjoys listening to good Italian music ought to buy. I remember purchasing these same 40 songs on two cassettes back in the mid 90s. I wore the tapes out. Now I'm glad to see that they are on two CDs. For those that say these aren't the ""original"" artists, they may be right on a few of them, however, the artists on these two CDs made these songs famous throughout Italy and North America. Give these songs a try, you'll be humming and singing along with them in no time."
4,Call to Spirit,"I bought this CD for one song, track 3, Shelter Me. To my surprise and pleasure all the tracks are good but track 3 is still the stand-out."
5,Power of the Pontchartrain,"One of my all time favorite Blues cd's! Every song is great! Tab has quickly become one of my favorite Blues Artists. My hat is off for the awesome lyrics, fantastic melodies, and the sound on this cd is amazing! The banjo on Midnight and Lonesome is so cool and just blew my mind how it fits so well in a low down soulful blues tune. Thanks for such a great cd Tab."
5,AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,All I need to say about this album is every song is GREAT and Song #6 MIDNIGHT AND LONESOME alone is worth the price of the album!!!!!! Get it and you will see... it is a GREAT... GREAT.. GREAT.. Blues song!!
5,Tab does it again!,"I have long been a Tab Benoit fan, and this CD does not disappoint. He just keeps on crankin' out great music. It is always hard on his CD's to pick a favorite, but on this one I would say that ""Shelter Me"" is my fav and ""I was Good to Ya, Baby"" along with the title track all stand out. Quality music from beginning to end."
3,Benoit knows NO feel,"Good guitar. Has the feel of the New Orleans scene. Excusing an arrangement or two, it's a good listen."
2,Disappointed,"I loved the old style ""rock and roll""and Cajun Blues rythems of his ""Best of the Bayou Blues"" album. Great listen throughout! For the most part, this album lacks the essential Blues Vibe that I've come to expect from Tab. Recommend you take advantage of the preview tracks and listen real hard before investing in this one! Keep the Blues alive!"
4,An important moment in Beatles history,"Although it is primarily a Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers release, MY BONNIE was the first album to feature two early Beatles/Sheridan songs, the title track (which appears in three versions, German intro, English intro, and no intro) and ""The Saints."" But don't ignore the other Tony Sheridan numbers; he is in fine voice throughout on this collection of Sheridan originals and early rock 'n' roll standards. If he had been able to develop more of his own style, and lessened the Elvis influence, he would had been a superstar in this business. This CD features the original 12-track German LP with 10 bonus tracks, all but the last one in true stereo. The version of ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" is the same version that was mistakenly used on the 2000 CD release ofTHE BEATLES FEATURING TONY SHERIDAN: IN THE BEGINNING. The two versions with The Beatles (found on the Bear Family box setBeatles Bop - Hamburg Days) have the same backing track, but different Sheridan vocals."
5,Making Spirituality Workable,"I loved this book for its scientific approach to the intangible essence of every person. It's as if you were sitting down with a wise, logical, and humorous professor who, in gentle, non-preachy ways, gave you the secrets to building a happy life. He tells you how to reduce stress and anxiety, how to have good relationships, how to find a profound purpose in living. More about spirituality than any particular religion, the book can help people of all backgrounds, even those without any religious upbringing. I'm highly recommending this book to my friends because I can honestly say I am happier and more serene because of it."
4,Core Performance workout,"The book has a good variety of core strengthening exercises. It was delivered promptly, in excellent condition and at a very good price."
5,The Core Performance,The book was recommed to me by a Chiropractor. I received it very quickly and I'm enjoying this book. Thanks
2,Dont buy the Kindle Version,I like the content but the Kindle version is terrible.The workout logs and spreadsheets don't show well on the Kindle screen.Difficult to read and follow.I should have purchased the paperback version.
1,Inpenetrable,"It is near impossible to figure out the exercise routines listed in this book. There are great exercises here and some of them I will continue to use, but the only way to follow the routine is to take the book with you to the gym and even then you will have to spend more time with your nose in the book then doing the exercise. There has to be an easier, clearer way to present this material."
2,Where's my sliderule?,"Break out your old calculus books to help you with the workout spreadsheets in the back. COMPLICATED. Some good information, but simply overwhelming in its scope. I had hoped for a somewhat brief core strenthening program (30 minutes 2-3 times a week). As a triathlete with a pretty full workout plate, I simply do not have a hour a day six days a week to spare."
3,Does it lead to injury?,"I like the workouts but have noticed that both times I have completed the program, I injured myself.I also find it ironic that once this book came out, Nomar has been injury prone. Is there a coincidence?"
2,"Hard To Understand System, Too Few Exercises","The system of training was hard to understand, and definitely hard to integrate into my workout program as I don't have much time, about 40 minutes a session. I bought the book for the exercises, and there weren't enough of them to make it worthwhile for the cost. A better option may be to work with a physical trainer who uses dumbbells and cable exercise to get some exercises that would benefit you instead."
2,Take a closer look,"I've read through Mark's book and agree with the fundamentals of training, but I think everyone reading this book should evaluate two things: (1) Mark has courted Nomar since his years at Georgia Tech... riding any kind of success as his own (shame on you), (2) Exactly how well has Verstegen's training proved beneficial to a consistently injured Nomar. There is a fine line between peak performance and injury... Verstegen is riding that line a little too closely don't you think. P.S. Are all of these principles ""new"" or ""recycled"" from leading experts in the field? Give credit where credit is due Verstegen."
4,Fantastic book,"Core Performance is a great book for all levels of athletes looking to get in shape. Some of the movements will be challenging for beginners, but overall if you stick with the program you will see great results.Side note: I bought this book many years ago when they only had a hardcover available - do yourself a favor and get the soft cover since you will be constantly referencing the book on how to perform certain exercises."
4,Warm up routine has treated me well,"I use the warm up routine from this book before I exercise (no sumo squats though). It's treated me well over the past 8 months.I'm interested in this stuff because I've been dealing with a functional leg length discrepancy. Again, the mobility-warm up routine was the best take away along with some of the ball workouts. Good stuff."
3,No revolution here,"If you're looking for a straightforward and simple program that encompasses both diet and exercise, you might want to look elsewhere. Although both diet and exercise are covered in this book, the exercise program is not the easiest to follow. There's nothing new or revolutionary in his approach to diet or exercise, but the WAY Verstegen lays out the exercise program is different. I like his approach to ""prehab"", and I gained some new ideas from the exercises he listed, but I'm disappointed in the overall book."
2,Great program ..... but for whom?,"2 stars because Mark says his program is for the masses, and it simply is not. Like vegetarianism, we might all be better off for it, but not everyone is fit or prepared to adhere to it. It's too extreme for mass appeal.Certainly not for the faint of heart or someone just thinking about getting in shape but not totally committed... totally. Unless you've just finished listenting to your Tony Robbins tapes.Beyond that it reads like an infomercial and it's presented in a way that makes it seem daunting for us mere mortals.The program looks amazing. So, for the remaining 1%, who will actually follow through, absolutely, there's plenty of meat, if you can digest it. And if so, you'll likely end up in the best shape of your life.My guess is that 99% of these end up collecting dust on the coffee table."
4,Well Writtten,"Core Performance is a concise easy Read. you could start out just about anywhere in the book, the info is never overwhelming and guess what- the information is never overwhelming and it actually works."
4,Great book if you have the time,Mark has done a great job of simplifying some very challenging material. His program can improve your performance and help reduce your risk for injury if you have the time to complete it. It is very thorough but time consuming.
5,Core Performance,"Awesome book - great workouts , program and dietA must for anyone serious about making a step change in their training"
4,Nice addition,"I bought this book to add to my fitness collection and to get a new perspective on fitness as I'm getting into my fifties.The book focuses on core work which is something that I've pretty much ignored until recently.After getting through 14 weeks (3 prep, 11 core), I've been pleasantly surprised at my progress. Using the plan pretty much to the letter, I've lost a fair amount of weightand improved my flexibility as well as strengthened my core areas.The only reason for the 4 rating was some unanswered questions that the book directs you to their website(for a fee) to answer.Otherwise it's a nice book."
3,Good but has flaws,I was very excited about the workout routine and really think the concept makes sense.He was good at getting your attention and reminding you that it's not all about looks but about health for years to come.What I didn't like was that it was very confusing to me. The way it was laid out and the terms used were kinda of tricky for me to remember.I felt like I had to plan out what I was going to do for 15 minutes before doing a single exercise.I also didn't see any mention about how to customize exercises for those that have knee problems or other issues someone may have. I know he cannot address everyone's problems but there doesn't seem to be any advice in that area.I think I would have rather borrowed the book from a friend/library but now that I have it I will continue with the program.
2,Not for everyone,"Although this book says it is for everyone, if you have had a good training routine for more than 8-12 months this may not be for you. I have run 2 marathons and work out 3x per week on a regular basis but wanted some more weight reduction and increased lean muscle mass. I started following the plan but it did not do enough for me compared to what I was already doing and I started to see a bit of a slide. The endurance training was not good for me at all, for others it could be great but the target zones were way too low.So if you are starting out or have started and stopped this would be a good book, but not if you are already working out regularly and have a good cardiac routine you may want to really review the details within the book."
3,A Mixed Bag,"This is a two CD set of German drinking and merrymaking music that comes in an attractive cardboard sleeve. Both CD's feature a mixed chorus ably accompanied by a traditional German oom-pah band. The main difference between the two CD's is the presence in disc 1 of partygoers who applaud, cheer, and make all manner of extraneous noise. To me, that spoiled the presentation. It sounded too much like a drunken bar scene. Disc 2, on the other hand, would make really great background music for any German theme party, including Oktoberfest. In my opinion, this set is worth buying just for disc 2."
1,I am very disappointed,"This is a collection of fine old German songs, cut in mid-verse sometimes like someone would switch stations on a push-button radio. I've heard all the song as a young man stationed in Germany during the cold war, and bring back memories. I wish the package was more honestly represented."
1,Volume 2 has contents mislabeled.,"Volume 2 is ""All The Best From The German Beer Garden"". See the description of the contents for that CD to find the real contents of Volume 2. The German spelling of the songs is incorrect."
2,Not what it's supposed to be!,"Yup, the first cd is not what is listed on the website, which is too bad, because some of those songs are great. Especially Schone Maid and Amboss Polka, they rock. I'm keeping the cd because they were gonna charge me for the shipping, so the heck with it. I now have some more background music for working in my shop or at my own little bier fests!"
1,Song List is misleading,"I was searching for a specific tune. The songs listed on this website and on the CD cover case are NOT what are on the CD. I was extremely disappointed. Any true German would know this when they played the CD. I was even more upset that since I opened the CDs, I was unable to return them. If you are looking for some of these tunes try the CD- ""German Music Fest"""
4,very good cd,"This sort of greastest hits package and some new things. The versions of Dust and 20 Days are supposedly demo's but they don't sound like demo's, in fact they are more catchy than the versions on cold war kids cd. Running with the lions is the best of the new tunes, actually made in 1988, just never did fit on a record after that but it would of fit well on bedtime story(1987). I don't believe in love is another new a hard rocker and very good. Man Camera is ok, kind of weak lyrics. The rest of these have been on cd before from various cd's.It is overall a very good package, not quite perfect but if you can't find anything else and are looking for carey tunes or want the different versions of the songs, Heard it on the radio is also a different version on this cd, then this cd is for you."
3,"Not Really Worth Buying, Get the Collection","The disc I am reviewing, no doubt had the potential to be a great cd, but fell short. Wrong songs were added such as Run With the Lions and Trampoline. Tony Carey's collection runs far and wide, and these two songs just took up space where real genuine songs such as perhaps a song from Pink World or even Jail from the Long Road. A bit disappointed in the overall way the way the tracks are laid out, demo versions in most albums are considered as bonus tracks and find themselves after the true tracks not bounced around in the middle. Sorry."
3,This might become really hard to find and go opp,"Well, it looks like this cd sank happy street in it's current form, so this cd might become really hard to find unless it gets liscensed out to someone. This is a pretty good cd but falls short of being a true retospective."
3,"Outdated, but still some good info","Romance Writer's Sourcebook is in serious need of an update. While the sections on craft, first sales, and anatomy of a sale are full of good information, the publisher and agent listings are outdated. It was a great reference when it was first published, but now it's just an okay book for a beginning writer."
5,"Not the most important punk album, but probably the most fun","Absent is the cartooniness that made the Ramones impossible to take seriously. In addition, another thankful omission is the overbearing rage and political grandstanding that make people take the Pistols and the Clash too seriously. Basically, this is arguably the best garage band ever(at least on this album), and they're flooring it on almost every tune with a punk energy that's rarely been rivaled. ""(I'm) Stranded"" is a great song, but ""Messin' with the Kid""(slow, grungy rocker), ""Erotic Neurotic"", ""No Time"", the cover of ""Kissin' Cousins"", and ""The Story of Love"" are its equal. The best tune - in my opinion - ""Night in Venice"", buries most punk songs with its potent, chord-ripping fury, and makes a great finale to a great album. The extra songs are good too. There's not a weak track here, and for a punk rock album, that speaks volumes."
5,Buzzsaw guitar at its very best,I'm Stranded (single) is still probably the best PUNK / NEW WAVE single ever....I bought the album on the back of this one song....The album blew me away....100mph and no holding back..If 'Kissin cousins' don't get you rocking...YOUR D**D!!!
3,Charlie Blue,I'm not that pleased but it may be my own fault. I thought I was getting what I got before and did not know that Charlie Blue is different than Charlie. It came on time though and was in good condition. I'll use it up and get the stuff I like next time.
3,The aroma is different!,"I purchased this perfume for the second time here in Amazon. The first one, like 2 years ago, was great! I knew Charlie perfume, I used many times and it was exactly the same as I remembered. I bought a second one no long time ago, and the aroma is completely different! I am a little dissapointed. It doesn't smell bad, but it does not smell like the original Charlie. What did you change it???"
3,It's okay....,"The perfume has a nice scent, but it fades so quickly that unless you wanted to carry the bottle around and reapply it periodically it's just not worth the price."
2,"Good price, Not great for gifts.",The prefume didn't even have the top sprayer and it shipped with fedex so it took forever to get to me. Had to buy a new one cause I couldn't give it as a gift for chirstmas. Disappointing.
5,Classic,"It's the classic Charlie fragrance from years back that still resonates today.Clean, classic, fragrance.Quick service/deliveryGreat price for bottle size!"
3,"Smells ok, it was a gift to give","I personally don't like this very much. I've been a Mugler Angel user for 6 yrs. But I got it to give it as a surprise gift to my mom that liked it many years ago. I have to admit, it brought up scent memory when I smelled it.I give it 3 stars because that's the rating for OK (middle range), I certainly didn't love it, but again it was not purchased for my own use.What I would like to say though is this:Be aware the blue box is not wrapped in plastic wrapper! Which being a gift, I would have liked it to be ( the cap was dented too). So I call Amazon, and get an RMA. The replacement comes without the wrapper too. I didn't return it however. The cap and the quantity of fluid inside seemed intact ( the first one had a dented cap and perfume seemed to be missing - it looked used all the way). The return service was fast (prepaid shipping label), and Amazon return personnel curtious, and helpful. Very happy with how the shipments were handled."
3,They were MOVIE STARS then...,"The image is soft and the voices of the actors are somewhat high pitched. It almost sounds like a recording that's been speeded up ever so slightly or duplicated on inferior equipment. The Technicolor look of this 50's actioner has, surprisingly, been fairly well rendered. And the script is not to be believed. Now to the big question: did I enjoy watching the gorgeous twosome, Rock and Yvonne, in this movie? I hate to admit it, but I sure did. It was everything I expected. A romantic adventure, great costumes (open shirts, plunging necklines) and not a dull moment. They sure don't make em like this anymore. Darn it."
3,High adventure with De Carlo and Hudson,"Veteran director Raoul Walsh was behind the camera of this average but nonetheless enjoyable swashbuckler cocktail. Yvonne De Carlo (looking quite fetching) is an English spy in Napoleonic France attempting to ferret out invasion plans and Rock Hudson is the smuggler who falls for her and unintentionally botches her both her plans and her cover. Shot in bright Technicolor, it's fun if you're not too demanding. Hudson was on the rise here at the beginning of his stardom but it's really the top billed De Carlo's picture here. Maxwell Reed as a traitorous smuggler and Bryan Forbes (before he became a director of such films as THE WHISPERERS) is Hudson's pal co-star.The VCI transfer is adequate, nothing more."
4,VCI RELEASE!!!!!,One of VCI's better releases of a high seas adventure. Picture quality looks quite good and the film looks complete with no splices.
3,"very good, not worth the money","the fact that this is the best rolling pin i've worked with is undeniable, but this does not justify having to pay 20-25$ for it...it's silicone, and quite large, comes in decorative red color and is really very easy to handle (ergonomically)bottom line - if you bake every day or every other day, get it - otherwise, get something else (not wood though - it absorbs water and gets ruined pretty fast)"
5,Great show - but get the complete set,"Recently, I was clearing my parents house out and found a box of old toys, including a bunch of Fraggle dolls that I had as a kid. When I mentioned this to my sister, she said she heard that Fraggles were making a comeback with a new movie coming out. Sure enough, when I checked Amazon, the complete series was available. It was such a joy to see this again. This is a great show for kids (or nostalgic adults). The puppetry is great. The show is very musical, but the songs (by and large) aren't corny or annoying. Some of them are actually a bit tender. The episodes often deal with themes like prejudice and the environment.That being said, I'd recommend getting the newerFraggle Rock: Complete Series CollectionDVD set. It has the complete series (as opposed to just a few episodes as on this product). For the price, it's a steal. I hope you enjoy your time ""down in Fraggle Rock""!"
5,Better than advertised,"This is a georgeous watch,beautiful fit and finish.The labeling on the back of the case states that the crystal is actually sapphire not mineral.Nice weight lets you know its there,once again polished stainless is absolutely flawless.Dont be misled by the name if you are a collector buy this watch it has a very unique band to case transition not seen in other chronographs.Bold yet stylish!"
3,Communism...,The start of ideas of communism.Communism is...Communism is....Communism is......Communism is........Communism is explained in this book. I was only required to read sections of this.CommunismCommunismCommunismCommunismCommunismCommunismCommunismCommunismCommunism
3,"File under amusing diversions (but ""Scarface"" is a gem)","Corin Tucker's sideproject Cadallaca is much more than a teaser to tide over rabid S-K fans during the brief intervals between its releases. Although this album's Out West theme holds only for its cover art and its title-track, a masterful murder ballad that brings to mind P.J. Harvey at her spookiest, the rest of the selections maintain the high level of quality if not the coherency of the concept. On ""The Trouble with Public Places,"" Tucker's trademark powder-keg vocals blast over a punchy rock backdrop peppered with melodic organ segments. The record's catchiest tune, ""Scarface,"" again uses organs with dazzling success, especially when all the other elements disappear during the stripped-down ending reprise of the chorus this isn't my real face, baby/it's just a scar. Emotional and irresistable, Out West proves that Cadallaca deserves the same accolades that are heaped upon Tucker's day-job outfit."
1,Do not order from this company!,It has been so long since I ordered this product I cannot remember the date and I still haven't received it. Although my account was charged immediately. I have a feeling this distributor is from China which does not make me feel confident on the quality as most of their products are knock-offs.
4,Pricey but works,"While I think this shampoo is overpriced, the reason it's better than the cheapest volumising shampoos is because it doesn't dry the hair out as much. My hairdresser recommended this for my color treated hair and I believe it helps keep the color from fading as quickly. I recommend searching for the best price you can find and giving Kerastase Volumactive a try. I've used it for the past year and feel it's worth the $$."
2,Overvalued shampoo that doesn't beat a $5-10 shampoo brand,"Based upon the previous positive reviews of this product, I purchased the Kersastase Volumactive shampoo. Although it lathers up quite nicely while in the shower, it didn't perform better than a well-known popular brand of volumizing shampoo which can be purchased for $5-10 (depending on size). In fact, my hair seemed less volumized, in comparison to the $5-10 shampoo, after using this shampoo. Based upon its performance and high cost, I would not recommend this product to obtain fuller looking hair. Needless to say, after this shampoo runs out, I will not be purchasing this again."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have straight, fine hair that has no body whatsoever. I was hoping this shampoo would give my hair some volume. I can't see any difference except in the volume of my wallet. Seriously--this product is $45 for 8 ounces, about $5.50 per ounce. Pantene, my usual brand which performs just as well: $0.26 per ounce.The only ""pro"" about this product, and I am really reaching here, is that it lathers up really well so you don't have to use as much per wash. So okay, instead of being 20x the price it's maybe 15x the price. Still, no comparison."
4,Makes hair feels so good,"This shampoo provides rich moisturizing. Your hair feels silky after use. I'd caution again using too much shampoo as a little goes a long way. Also, I find I have to alternate with other shampoos or it weighs down my hair after several consecutive uses."
2,"I use lots of Kerastase products, but don't find this one very impressive","I use the deep conditioners and other shampoos from Kerastase, and so decided to try this volumizing shampoo for fine hair (like mine). I actually thought that it weighed my hair down MORE than the other lines of Kerastase, and so would recommend that you stick with the orange and white bottles instead for fine hair."
5,Best shampoo,"I bought the Kerastase Volumactive Volumizing shampoo hoping to see the advertised results. I have normal hair strands, but they lack volume, so after trying this shampoo for 2 times, I could already see results: the hairs are fuller, and they seem healthier. I used to wash my hair every 3 days because it became oily, and now it lasts 1 week without seeing the greasy hairs.I use it in conjunction with its conditioner, so that may be a reason for such a big improvement in the way my hair looks and feels. It is recommended to change the shampoo every once in a while so the scalp/hair doesn't get used to the same environment/chemicals, but I intend to buy Kerastase products from now on. Great brand, products and results."
2,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,"One more over-rated and over priced Kerastase product. Again,...one can get the same results w/a much, much less expensive product. When something is suppose to add volume,..I expect to see REAL volume! I know it can't do miracles,..but dont hype it up and price it up when it does just a mediocre job at best."
3,is it really new?,"I buy this book as if it was new, I payed more than 70 dolares for itI expected the book to be new as it said but to my surprise when it arrive the outside hard cover was very damagedProbably it was the shipping...but I dont know..I've received lots of books in excellent conditions, but this was not the caseI didnt compain because I need it to start a course but anyway I think they should be more carefull when transporting the items we buy since we are paying for new and not for damage books"
2,Lehninger Biochemistry Review,"The book itself was very interesting and a great introduction to biochemistry, however, the shippers are losers. They sent a hardcover, ~20 pound book in a simple envelope even though I spent the extra money for fast, safe delivery. Not only was the book not even sent until 5-6 days after the expected delivery date, the outside of the book was severely damaged when I finally got it. I am wholly dissatisfied with the way they treated me."
1,Horrible Textbook,"This book is the worst book that I have ever used, and has forced me to buy two other books in order to review basic concepts. The chapters are boring despite the interesting subject matter. Most information is given in a hard to comprehend format, and there are very little examples to illustrate concepts. I recommend Medical Biochemistry and Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews instead."
3,book,no CD and book is ok. The book is good though but f you said there will be a CD then why there was not one?
3,Thorough but dry,"This book will most likely tell you everything you need to succeed in any biochemistry class, but it probably won't inspire you to love biochemistry. If you have the opportunity to check out either Bruce Alberts et al. Molecular Biology of the Cell or Lipincott's biochemistry it makes the subject a whole lot more palatable and even fun and interesting. I've used Molecular Biology of the Cell and Lehninger side by side for my biochemistry class in medical school and while the answer is generally found in both, MBOC gives more thorough explanations in a conversational style that makes it much more enjoyable to read. Lipincott is also excellent for pictures and figures that give clinical correlates that aid in learning difficult topics."
3,Lehninger Biochem,I personally liked the specific examples given. I enjoy being able to relate to the examples. Pretty straight forward read.
1,this was absoluteley terrible,This was absolutely terrible. A bunch of very old drab scenes. I couldn't stand the male narrator. Something wierd indeed. Worth the price!
4,Gas-Magnum Shocks-work as advertised.,"1995 Silverado K1500 5.7 Ext.Cab w/6' bed. Installed about 2,000 miles ago on all (4) corners. Work as advertised by damping uneven road surfaces by keeping all four tires firmly on the road. Currently running worn BFG long trail T/A's (6/32"" left on front tires) and these Gas-Magnums majorly improve turning by actually steering this large truck where I point it. Before these shocks the truck drifted through turns. Haven't taken off road yet.While a minor hassle installing on front end, (rears were EZ), these beefy 2"" wide shocks were definitely worth the effort because they honestly improve both my trucks handling & safety. Tough to find elsewhere at a better price too. Would buy again."
3,look inside and you'll find the gems,"well this not being the greatest album ugly kid joe produced and sadly it was their last because it didn't get a warm review from fans and critics which was a bit harsh because it's not a bad album just an average one...nothing like america's least wanted they went for a darkier sound with ""motel califonia""includes my favorites ""it's a lie"" ""dialogue"" ""would you like to be there""great chorusother highlights include ""12 cents"" a nice acoustic ditty to end an average album from the pretty boy floyd beaters"
1,This SUX!!,"This is a bad CD. The song writing is very poor. Example of that is , in one song (can't remember which one), A lyric goes""Raise your hands in the air, Let me see that armpit hair"". How desperate do u have to be to write crap like that.If you want UGly Kid Joe get an earlier album or the greatest hits."
3,More of the Same,"The band that brought us such singles as ""I Hate Everything About You"" and a terrific remake of ""Cat's in the Cradle"" falls flat on this effort. The songs appear derivitive, and somehow dated. As a fan of ""party rock"", I am somewhat biased. I recommend track 4."
2,Whit's voice,"This album, with the exception of 2-3 songs, is just plain bad. It sounds as if Whit has blown his voice out, which is believable after the great effort he put into Menace. They got away from what made them great in the first place: Whit's voice, great guitar, and humorous lyrics. Two songs are humorous (the sandwich song and Rage against..), and I'd say the best part of this album is trying to call the numbers on ""Rage""."
5,Great Song,I first heard this song just a few days ago as my boyfriend has been deployed to finish up some of the bussiness in Iraq This song reminds me of everything about him.
4,"I like this video, but I bought it by mistake","This is a video of interviews with celebrities who knew Michael Jackson well. It is good, but contains very little of his performances, I mistook it for Michael Jackson's number ones, which is a collection of his number one hits and their respective videos"
4,Good Overview,Good career overview in 39 minutes. Inspired my kids to want the full videos for some of the songs.
5,Michael Jackson: The Greatest Entertainer That Ever Lived!,There will never be another Michael Jacksonand The One dvd is proof. It felt like youwere at a live concert watching him perform!
2,I Am A Huge Supporter...but I was Cheated!,"First of all, I am as big of a MJ supporter as you can get...I have website, and promotion to show that he innocent...however..that can't take away from the fact that THIS SUCKED!First of all....why the hell did he put a CBS special on a DVD? I mean....leave it on TV, the special wasn't that good in the first place. It didn't show my favorite MJ material, that were number ones...including : We Are The World, Remember The Time, In The Closet, You Are Not Alone, Earth Song, and You Rock My World.!Only 39 minutes!? How ridiculous.If you want true MICHAEL JACKSON MATERIAL, check out the following:Michael Jackson Dangerous: The Short FilmsMichael Jackson History 1Michael Jackson History Volume 2 (The best)Number OnesBuy any of his CD's....JUST AVOID THIS!"
1,waste of money,"first of all, let me just make it clear that I'm a huge fan and supporter of michael jackson, but this DVD was not worth my money, because I already have it taped from when it aired on CBS. This DVD cut out a little bit of parts that were shown on CBS, but not on this. And there is no Wanna Be Starting Something video on this, I don't know what one of the previous reviewers is talking about. By the way, the special is completely amazing, the version on CBS anyways, I really needed to watch something like this during this hard time in michael's life. The only thing missing was more intense footage from the Dangerous, HIStory and Invincible eras, those eras were equally as good as the previous 3. Michael Jackson is a legend and will continue making great music in the future I hope."
1,This is trash!,"If you want to hear the jerks talk about Michael Jackson, you will find some on this disc.But if you want to hear his music, watch him dances, you can only find scant piecemeals on this disc.Its not even worth the postage."
3,Michael Jackson - The One,"When I ordered this I thought it would be all Michael's songs, but there weretoo many people interupting, giving their opinion that I could not enjoy thesongs."
4,I miss this is out of stock already,"It rains a lot here in Singapore, so I need a waterproof CD player. It's a bit big and heavy because of its sturdiness and water resistance feature. So I won't complain about that. Sound Quality is a little lower than other models I own, especially high sound frequency level is weak. But thinking that this is designed for the outdoor sports environments, I agree with that the bass is very strong even not using bass boost function. It never skips. It seems to be an obsolete player but I really love something honest music players for everyone from kids to very old people."
3,Recharging issues; a bit large for running,"My DCS901 MP3 disc player did not recharge the batteries recommended by Sony. I tried two different battery sets and now I'm sending the unit back in for repair. Also, I think it is too large for running comfortably. It is bulkier than the Sony Sport Walkman tape player that I previously used and I wanted to get away from that bulk. I would prefer a small flash MP3 player. Volume was almost not loud enough in noisey areas."
5,Perfect for me,"I have coarse, thick, wavy, super healthy hair. What does this mean for the product?Coarse: The grooming cream makes it shiny and soft.Thick: Usually, I have to use a lot of product. With this grooming cream, I use less than a dime size each day. One tube lasted me from May until September before needing to be replaced.Wavy: I need a product that keeps the waves together and not frizzy, which this cream does.Healthy hair: I don't use any heat on my hair and wash it every other day. This cream helps give my hair a ""style"" without heat and, with reapplication the next day, helps me go longer between washes.I'm a low-high maintenance girl. I don't mind spending a lot for a product that requires little effort on my part to use correctly and look good."
3,"Lovely, but you can get cheaper","I love this stuff, but in these trying economic times, I am opting for the cheaper and adequate Loreal equivalent."
2,Not the miracle product I was hoping for.,"Not any better than putting skin cream in your hair. It still takes lots of work to brush through tangled and damaged ends, even with generous amounts. Overpriced, over-hyped."
3,"If you like rare stuff, try this.","Some had talents and some ain't got it. The Fe Fi 4 Plus 2, The Lincoln St. Exit, The Lemon Drops, The Bluethings had potentials, just wondering why they didn't make it big. There were nice attempts to duplicate Yardbirds' For Your Love, Music Machine's Talk Talk, but the Kinks' Well Respected-Man was butchered by Yesterday' Children. Rare groups and some never heard songs worth listening to, at least once."
4,Chilling! Thrilling! Zonked out!,"The first of what is promised to be a release of Mexican horror films purchased from Mexico by exploitation meister K. Gordon Murray in the early Sixties. Lots of related TV spots/trailers, with LOTS!!! OF!!! ECHO!!! ON!!! THE!!!! ANNOUNCER'S!!! VOICE!!!! Good reading on the included eight page booklet talking about Murray's career. Wacky gorillas! Mad scientists! Masked wrestlers! Bad Twist music! These have got it all. But I can't wait for my two favorites, once glimpsed in a drunken state at 3:00 a.m. on a New Jersey UHF station: The Brainiac and the truly creepy Curse of The Doll People! Cursed dolls come to life and start stabbing people to death! THis is 30 years before ""Chucky"", remember!"
2,BETTER THAN THE ROBOT,"With this double feature we do not get eggroll. We get the first movie, DOCTOR OF DOOM, which we can skip because we only bought the DVD to watch the other movie, so intrigued were we by the title. WRESTLING WOMEN VS THE AZTEC MUMMY is indeed better that THE ROBOT VS THE AZTEC MUMMY, which came from the same source, K. Gordon Murray dumpster diving behind the Mexican cinema lots again. I won't get into LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD AND THE MONSTERS but if you buy this DVD you can see the trailer from it. Only seeing is believing.WRESTLING WOMEN actually has a few yucks going for it, and if you are into bad movies, well, you could do worse."
4,Good shoe,I wore these shoes when my husband and I climbed Mt Fugi in Japan they have good traction for steep climbing. They got a little slick when it rained on our decent but other than that they are great for a tough climb or hike.
3,A bit short in size,I purchased this shoe for a hiking trip to Canada. It is too small in length and a bit wide (B). It looks like a pretty good shoe but not exactly what I am looking for. I am returning for a different brand.
5,An Incredible Ska-Core Album!,"Big D and The Kids Table is your basic underground fast paced ska/punk band. Theyre great and so is this album. If you like Link 80,Mu330,Slow Gherkin,Mad Caddies and such, you'll like these guys. All 15 tracks are good. I can never get sick of this album. They have harder songs, more trad ska songs, funny songs and fast ska/punk songs. Their horn section is great and they put on a good live show as well. So, if you like ska, go and pick this up and see these guys when they play in your area."
1,Big D & the Kids Table is no good,"I have to tell you, I thought this cd would be good, it got good reviews and after hearing ""Myself"" I was excited. It's a big disappointment. It's just the same old tired songs time after time. The lyrics are lame, the intstruments don't add much either. If you want to hear some good ska, check out Less Than Jake, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and Catch 22."
5,big d rules,"big d is awesome, buy this cd if you like ska. some of their earlier stuff is good, like the fork in hand split with drexel or their ep ""energy"". go to a show, they kick ass, its definitly worth it."
1,Russian copy of a Japanese vinyl release,"This, along with many other Mini LPs on Amazon that are only available from re-sellers, is a Russian copy of a Japanese vinyl release."
5,A Must HAVE.,I Like being able to print ANYWARE that i use my printer where there is no POWER>>>>>GET ONE.
1,Very Unhappy,I never got the merchandise and the am having a difficult time getting a refund. The customer service can track that I never got the package and they will not issue a refund until the post office sends the package back to them and in the meantime I need to pay the credit card bill. Who knows how long it will take the post office to send the package back.
4,it rocks,"when i first got it,it was hard to aim with the laser but edventally i got used to it and won almost all the paintball fights me and my friends had (as a sniper).the folding stock is pretty cool and don't think of it as a ripoff 'cause even though it's kinda cheap it's great for assault and for being a sniper.for the most part it rocks okay people so buy it!!!"
2,It's awful...,"The only relatively nice thing about this is that it can be fully disassembled. That's about it. Obviously it's not scale, as it advertises, but it's more like 2/3 than 3/4... The folding stock swings out with little effort... it can't be locked into place when in the folded position. The laser dot sight is incredibly flimsy. It's not worth it, even as a prop."
5,Casio Men's HDD600G,"Very neat watch for the price; stopwatch, dual time, date, wr100, my son loves it from the first sight - his friends do have mostly wr50 watches."
2,"Great Bag, but won't hold most 15"" laptops","I bought this bag because I love the look and durability of Domke bags. I am a photojournalist and I have used Domke photo bags for a long time. I was very excited to get another Domke for my new computer. Unfortunately, my 15.6"" HP sticks almost 2 inches above the top of the padded insert, rendering the bag near useless for protection. A 15"" Macbook Pro sticks out about 1.5 inches. Other than that, great bag. But most newer wide-screen 15"" laptops stick well out of the top of the padded insert. Definitely a deal breaker for a laptop bag. If you have a 13"" or smaller computer it would make a great bag. They shouldn't advertise it as a 15"" laptop bag."
2,A little dissappointed,"I like the fact that Domke put a panel for organizing small items, such as pads and pens in the front pocket of this bag. Overall quality was good, which is typical of Domke. But the thing that I could not get past was the way that the top flap does not fully cover the top opening of the bag making it useless in even the slightest rain or in dusty conditions. to me this in simply inexcusable for a computer or camera bag especially or any messenger bag for that matter. What were they thinking. Did they look at the bag after it was designed before putting it into production? I replaced this with and F-802, which is much better, but lacks the spaces for pens and small items. I have owned many Domke bags before this and will continue to buy form them, this one is simply a dud, don't waste your money."
4,Very interesting and fun album,I bought this album after hearing Earl's Breakdown on the radio. I'm definitely glad I did. This is one of the most fun and interesting albums I've bought recently. So many genres are played out now-a-days; hearing music where an artist mixes things in new ways is really refreshing. I saw TT play with the Wayfaring Strangers a few weeks ago. I was very impressed by his playing and bought the new WS album also.PSWhy not a 5? I'd only give a masterpiece a 5. Maybe one out of several hundred albums is a five.
3,A real risk-taker,"You have to give it to TonyT....he has never run away from taking musical risks, and this album is another example. If you love his previous ""experimental"" work, you will probably like this. I good bit of it works IMHO, and some is a little more jarring....but some of that is probably Tony's intent."
4,Just what I needed,"I could not a find the right dosage in local stores and did not hesitate to order via Amazon. It was delivered before promised which I always appreciate.I was a little disappointed when I opened the bottle and found what look like green M & Ms. This wouldn't be a problem if I didn't have kids (8, 6 and 4) and IRON in this strength could be poisonous to the 6 & 4 year-old. Now I have to have an in-service with my kids and explain what it is and what do to (or not do) if they find one on the floor."
5,A many year's user,I have been using this item for many years on advice of my Dr. It has given me the needed iron to put a stop to the problem of anemia.I can get it at my Pharmacy but it takes longer for delivery and a few cents more than ordering it this way.
1,I WOULD BUY THIS BUT I DONT KNOW WHAT ***PAD SIZE :100 IS??????,"I HAVE BEEN ANEMIC FOR YEARS. I CAN ONLY TAKE FERROUS GLUCONATE. AS THE SULFATES MAKE ME SICK. I HAVE NEVER HEARD THE TERM ""***PAD SIZE :100"" IF THIS SELLER ON AMAZON WOULD DEFINE IT AND ALSO GET A BETTER PICTURE OF THE BOTTLE SO YOU COULD READ IT. BECAUSE YOU CANT TELL WHAT THAT IS EITHER? I WOULD BE SCARED TO BUY THIS MUCH LESS TAKE IT. IS THAT LAPPAD, IPAD, AIPAD,PADS TO STICK ON YOUR BODY ? WHAT ?"
1,Can't review what you don't receive,"I never got the product, so can't review it. In the mean time, I found it at my locally owned, small pharmacy."
2,As Generic as it gets.,"This is an Anime that I have heard people rave about. I honestly did not like it. The premise is that a fighting tournament is taking place to determine the best fighter in the world. Each fight is extremely boring and all of the fighters are generic and uninteresting. There is little or no character development, period. The animation is inconsistent (several characters look completely different during different episodes.) The show ends in a letdown fight between Baki and His Brother (who he doesn't know is his brother until near the time of the fight.) This is an anime that I would avoid personally, but some individuals may like it. If you are into tournament style anime, then I would suggest looking elsewhere. Dragonball Z, Yu Yu Hakusho, Naruto, and others are all better at showing tournament fighting than this show."
2,Boyhood fantasy!,"I recently saw this movie on TV, and thought it would be nice to nave a copy for my collection. Growing up in the 40's and 50's, I had a major teenage crush on Vera-Ellen. Unfortunetly, this is not one of her better films. The basic plot was good, but it was poorly developed; the acting was terrible-even by 1951 standards; Cesar Romero's character was exceedingly irritating; and the choreography was really bad. The state of preservation of the film was not all that good on TV, so I bought the ""Enhanced"" version DVD. The quality was much worse than what was on TV. The color was seriously faded, and there were several places where the film slipped as if it had been spliced. Neither of these problems were present in the TV version."
1,Save your money!,"This is the worst movie I have seen only next to Paranormal Activity! I can't believe I wasted an hour+ out of my life watching this. What happened to the writers of scary movies? All this man did was smoke cigarette after cigarette! The ending was terrible. I really can't say anything good about it. I just pray you will buy a pizza or something rather than waste it on this ""movie"""
2,Dissapointed,I thought this film was dull. Nice to see R-Pattz but the film itself was boring! I cant wait to see the documentary ROBsessed about Robert Pattinson i heard from my friend who went to a special screening that it is just amazing. It apparently has interviews with some of his ex girlfriends!
2,Too Much Reliance on Visuals,"To rate a movie highly because of the appearance of a single actor does an injustice to the story and to everyone else involved. The acting by all was more than adequate to convey the story but for a few directorial impediments. Such as first, the director relied to much on a dark, barely visible setting making it difficult to relax and fully enveloped the nuances of the story. All was lost in the darkness - darkness as a cheap substitute for drama and suspense. Second, props such as spiders contributed little to understanding the character and were cheaply overused. Third, the story was edited to the point of fragmentation leaving the viewer to guess more than understand."
2,Wow,"I thought that I would give this movie a shot because it had Rob Pattinson in it and I knew he was a good actor. However, even he couldn't make this movie work. It was dark, confusing and seemed like all they were promoting was smoking. I think he did the best with what he had to work with but I'm glad I Red Box Rented this movie instead of wasting $15 on it."
2,2 at best at 3 am great to watch w/ friends,"The movie was fantastic when I was sleepy at 3 am, but watching it in the daylight the shattiness of the movie comes into light. The fact that he wants to bang the woman that raised him is too funny to be serious!! Also the fact that copious amounts of Cedric Diggory jokes can be made when he is being bathed is priceless. Sorry to ruin the ending but with the whole aunt trauma/love thing, the dry humping after he slit her throat and is macking on her lips is soooo funny my roomie and myself fell off the bed laughing. If you want a movie that is as deep in plot as an ABC family original movie then this is the movie for you. This is also the movie for you if you want to show your boyfriend that Pattinson's abs are air brushed in New Moon, to make Pattinson seem like less of a threat to your relationship."
2,The Haunted Airman,"In my opinion this was an awful movie. It was just very boring and not much happened. I was so disappointed. Rob did do an amazing job at playing the character, he is an amazing actor."
3,Haunted Airman,This movie is another one I think my expectations were set to high on when I got it. Maybe partly as a result of it being set in a British back ground and I have not watched a lot of movies with this style setting.
1,"Attractive Actor, Boring Movie","I'm sure most people that watch this movie will be watching it to get another glance at Robert Pattinson and I don't blame you. But if you are looking for an entertaining movie, this is not it. It was odd and boring and I had no clue what was happening through the entire thing. I hoped that something would happen in the end to make the time I had spent watching it worth while, but no. Pattinson's acting is very good but the movie is a snore. Do yourself a favor and just watch Twilight again."
2,Very bad ending,While the acting was very good the director keeps building the suspense and then abruptly leads to a very bad ending.
1,Did you 5 star folks actually watch this??,"I confess - I purchased this movie along with other Rob Pattinson features after watching the Twilight series which I loved. What a dissapointment this is- not in Rob's performance ( however most of it is chain smoking and mumbling) but in the film. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, right up there with the Quick and the Dead from eons ago! Most of the film is in dark shadow, distorted, and slow paced. If you find your eyes wandering due to the uninspired script, you can actually see the mic and cables float into view. If you still want to see for yourself, rent instead of buying."
1,too real,"I couldn't watch more than 30 minutes of this before I turned off the DVD player and did something more important, it was a soap opera that was too real and POINTLESS. If it was a psychological thriller, I failed to see where. The acting by everyone in it was wooden, and emotionless, I couldn't care less about any of the characters. Granted, the movie was set in WWII England, maybe it had some appeal to English people, but not to me. It could have been so much more dreamlike, surreal, involving engaged actors and a chaotic plot, but instead it came off as being almost an amateur attempt at explaining the psychology of the main character. Robert Pattinson cannot act."
3,The Haunted Airman,"The Haunted Airman was truly an unusual and disturbing tale. The descent into madness of the main character was terrifying to watch. Robert Pattinson did a remarkable job in his portrayal of the disturbed soul whose madness we cringe to watch develop. He takes chances as an actor. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this film to Pattinson's teenage fans, especially those only familiar with his Harry Potter role and his Twilight role. They would probably enjoy much more his character in Remember Me. But if someone is a devotee of the really dark British crime films, then he would definitely enjoy this work. Besides anything with Julian Sands I always enjoy watching."
2,Glad I Only Rented!,"This was an intriguing film--not a particularly good one, but truly intriguing. Julian Sands and Robert Pattinson are always worth watching, but even they couldn't elevate the weird plot.One thing that stood out was the ending. American films usually find a way to wrap up the loose ends, so it is refreshing to sometimes see a movie that doesn't. I didn't particularly like the ending, but I did think it was a suitable conclusion to the story.While it was interesting to see this film, I'm glad I just rented it."
1,Pattinson cannot save bad script,"Pattinson is great here, stretching beyond his vampire role, but even he cannot save this awful script, which was probably better as a story than as a film. The story is confusing, dull, and the ending is disappointing to say the least. Too bad. It could have been quite good had it been handled better."
2,"Pattinson is handsome, but not worth sitting through","Thank God it's short! Pattinson is definitely nice to look at, and I loved hearing his native accent. But he chain smokes throughout, which ruined his looks just a bit. It's a period piece - everybody chain smokes. This is one of those old-fashioned psychological thrillers, like Turn of the Screw. Try it if you like that stuff. But if you just want to see Pattinson, don't bother.Julian Sands reappears-wasn't he the love intrest in Room With a View? Disturbingly older - but aren't we all? And now perhaps the bad guy, but same beautiful voice. Made me wonder what he's been doing all these years...?"
3,The Haunted Airman,It was nice to hear Robert Pattinson with his english accent. The movie was a little confusing but I'm sure if I was to watch it again I would probably catch some things I missed.
3,great acting,"Clearly a made-for-tv-movie, this film is not spectacular, yet very captivating, very disturbing, and very well acted, thus haunts its audience for a long time.Unfortunately, this DVD lacks any kind of bonus material or subtitles."
3,Just ok,"If you are just wanting to see RPattz then by all means this is the movie to watch. This is a low budget film that tries to tell a story of a soldiers mental and physical declination due to the evils of war and his strange sexual relationship/fascination w/his Aunt. I'm not sure what the other reviewers are watching when they score this a four or five because Titanic is a five and this movie is no where near the calliber of film as Titanic. Buy it if you just want to look at Robert Pattinson, but its not purchase worthy for any other reason."
1,don't bother.....,"Ordered this for a friend that loves Robert P.......he's great, but the story was limp and amateurish.....waste of film...waste of time..."
1,Waste of Money,"I put this on my watchlist awhile ago and finally decided to rent it. What a waste. I'm sorry that I spent the money on it. It started with a good premise, but the characters were not developed enough to hold my interest."
2,The Haunted Airman,"The main reason I purchased this movie was because it starred Robert Pattinson. He did a good job in his role in the account. But, although it may have been true story, the movie was done in a poor way, in my opinion. I did not really care for the movie."
1,Two hours of my life I'll never have back.....,"While I adore Robert Pattinson, and while he delivers in the acting department, the film was slow.... I kept waiting for something...ANYTHING to happen and it was nearly two hours of NOTHING... the relationship Pattinson has with his ""aunt"" is, unfortunately, the creepiest thing about this film... and if they could give Academy awards for the most cigarettes smoked, Pattinson would win hands down... Was this film underwritten by Marlboro?!?If you are looking for Edward Cullen, look elsewhere.... If you have two hours to kill and want to feel empty, depressed and disappointed, give this turd a whirl.... then again, you may enjoy a root canal more.I rented this disaster from Blockbuster...man, am i glad I didn't fork over real money for it....."
1,Haunted,"As much as I love you ""Robert Patterson, I did not like you in this movie and I am glad that I only rented the movie and not purchased it. :("
2,Horrible movie!,"You'll get a Robert Pattinson fix, but that is all. The movie was really strange and not in a good, cool way."
1,Upset,This movie was not really good at all. The story line went no where. I purchased it mainly because of the actor in the Twlight series and Harry Potter. Wouldn't recommend this movie at all.
1,Ughhh,"Most boring movie ever. The End. No seriously, it had no meat to it and was hard to sit through without checking the clock to see how much longer you had to suffer. I'm sure the only people rating it five stars are twi-hards who have massive crushes on Rob Pattinson and would like any movie he was in purely because they are blinded by the sight of his face, hahah! Terrible terrible movie."
1,Really?,"The only good thing about this movie was Robert Pattinson....the story was dull, even for British standards....do not purchase this movie unless you are a fan of Robert Pattinson and require this for your collection....."
4,Interesting movie,"The movie was definitely not what I was expecting. However, I think that Robert Pattinson did an excellent job portraying someone who was either extremely delusional or in an incredibly disturbing situation. This movie made me think about what is reality and how we know the truth. This movie makes the audience question everything. I would not recommend this movie to everyone though; I can see how some people may find it off-putting."
1,The Haunted Airman,"I must not be a british show person, so this was very dry and not overly apealing. I ordered it because I am a hugh Twilight fan and wanted to see Robert Pattinson outside of that area."
1,worse ever,"this movie was all over the place and terrible! the only reason people are watching it is to see robert pattinson's GORGEOUS self. but other than him, the movie was awful. i wouldnt recommend anyone spending more than $1 on this movie from redbox, and even then it isnt worth it!"
1,A bad Made-for-British-TV movie...,"I had high hopes since the story seemed interesting and creepy, which was what we were going for. It wasn't... sadly, I will never get back those hours of my life. I'm a fan of Robert Pattinson, but I wish I hadn't seen this movie because I know he can do so much better!"
2,BORING,"the movie is short, boring and confusing. Robert Pattinson did well but the story mediocre to say the least and the movie was DULL and BORING"
4,The Haunted Airman,This is a dark and dreary movie but I liked it because I enjoy Robert Pattinson's acting skills.
1,A pity 1 star is the minimum,"Another flop for the BBC. Never read the book, but shudder to think a screen play could have been this bad from a good book(?) There is NO plot. There is NO storyline. Its pretty much about a neurotic, chain smoking, wounded war veteran in a sanatorium. The characters are shallow and do nothing to keep you interested. The strange camera angles, which add a lot to film noir, and although sometime eerie, do nothing but contribute to the short comings of this film.What I disliked about this film - The actors/acting, the plot/storyline, the music, the lighting, THE MOVIEWhat I liked about this film - ABSOLUTELY NOTHING"
2,It was ok,"I felt that the movie had no plat or story line. Although I love Robert Pattinson, I didn't know what was supposed to be going on. All I knew was that there was a wounded airman that ended up in an assisted living facilty and seemed to slowly go crazy. The acting itself was good, but that just wasn't enough. I just needed to know what was supposed to be going on instead of just random scenes with random acting."
2,The Haunted Airman,The acting was great but I did not understand what was going on during the entire movie.
1,Karisatk,This movie was one of the worst movies . I have ever seen. It did not make any sense and the plot was meaningless. Do not buy this movie.It is a waste of your time.
1,The only reason this gets one star is because of Rob,"I watched this movie because of my interest in seeing Rob in another acting role. Well, this movie wasted about 70 minutes of my life I can never get back. I felt like the movie was about 4 hours and had to watch it in a couple sittings just to get through it to see if it would get any better. Unfortunately it never got any better and left me saying 'huh?' at the end. I do have to say Rob was wonderful to look at and I give him props for his acting ability in this role. Just rent this one, don't bother buying it."
1,"Seriously, what's up with the spiders!!???","Absolutely, equivocally, totally disliked this movie/weird could be a broadway fiasco! It just didn't make sense! My sister and daughter and I were like, ""What!?, I don't get that part. Wait, maybe the spiders are his imaginary friends.... Who is this lady exactly???."" It was strangely slow moving and not worth ever seeing again except for the possible razzy award it might garner. It did seriously haunt my sister in her sleep though!!! She had nightmares of those darn spiders!! LOL"
4,Great bag for Anyone,This bag is so great. I love the split compartments on the inside and the very soft changing pad. The pocket on the back is great for anything you need close to you for security. Plus its far from bulky. This bag is great for trips and my sons father doesn't mind using it either!!
2,Missing mounting tape,"Mounting tape was missing in all four packages! Had to purchase tape in order to use product. Outside of that, it was as represented."
5,wow,if you are interested in day liles this is a must have. excellent pictures to idenify your day lilies.
4,"Pretty, Pretty Pictures",You will not find another book with such a variety of beautiful photos of daylilies. For daylily growers that want the most comprhensive photo gallery available to date. I would have enjoyed more details about the parentage of these beautiful daylilies. Munsen and Hill are tops for information but Petit's Encyclopedia is by far the pick for beautiful photos. I am sure the five stars this book received from reviewers was based on the hundreds of excellent color and variety of daylily types. If you like lots of top notch photos this is the best!!!
2,"Good, but ...","Not what I was expecting from this kind of movies. My honest opinion is to consider not buying this movie and try to find it free on the Web, since you will see this one not more than once (if you dare ...)."
2,Only half the movie,"The movie seemed promising, until chapter 6 when it stopped playing. Disappointment to say the least. Unfortunatly it was so long after purchase until I noticed."
5,A roaring good time!,"My one-year-old son and I roar together when we read this noisy book! The book follows a lion cub in Africa as he goes on a walk to find someone to play with him. Of course, the other animals run away thinking he is roaring at them. Delicious alliteration adds to the fun as the cub runs into increasingly larger groups of animals. The illustrations using acrylics and colored pencils give the animals wonderful faces."
3,"Oh, dear . . .","Zzzzzzzz...Had the whole class bored to tears. The basic info is alright, but the constant repetition was hard to take. Policy can be such an exciting subject, surely Mr. Dobelstein will put out a more exciting edition. Maybe he could try to incite discussion by injecting a little more controversy."
3,Good handbook for the lab,"The book is in excellent condition and I received it in a timely manner. I thought I was ordering the 5th edition, but received the 4th edition. I'm not sure what the differences are, but I'm sure our lab will be able to use it."
2,Technical and very complete,"I waited quite some time in anticipation of this book. In fact, shipping was delayed by nearly a month. I am reluctant to admit it, but I found it terribly technical. That is the reason I am writing this review. It is quite thorough but more than I expected or needed. Additionally, I was so glad to finally receive it that I mindlessly wrote my name on it without thinking about returning it for something more suitable to my needs. I just hope that someone else can avoid my mistake by reading this review."
4,Interesting Overview,"The book starts with an interesting and simple overview on Mechanics and Electromagnetism. The basic concepts of SR are presented, like Lorentz Transformations, space contraction, time dilatation, velocities addiction and the well known ""E = mc2"". It ends with a small introduction to GR.The notation is not quite usual, so don't be surprised to read ""K = mb"" for the usual ""F = ma"". Anyway, read it if you are young (I read it right after my ""Sweet Sixteen"") or if you want reduced knowledge of the matter."
1,Warning: January 2010 printing defective,"Warning: the January 2010 printing is not a book: it's just unformatted text printed with no diagrams. It's completely worthless.The actual book is pretty good. I lent my copy to a friend, and never got it back. I wanted a copy for reference, so I tried to order it here. But what I got is bound pages of worthless computer printout."
1,a fake book,"we have already been cheated by one of Amazon sellers from whom we bought the same book in july but only received in China last week. So anybody what we should do to get the money back from amazon organization as soon as possible because we cannot sell back a book to others. The book is not useful to the reader and so cannot be sold to any body. It can only be given back to the seller and get money and excuses immediately. The book is a photo-copy from a computer trype book, that is without spacings between chapters, without figures and with a lot of misprints.book name: Einstein's Theory of RelativityMax BornSold by: Amazon.com, LLCAnd it cost more than $20!"
5,Odyssey,It?s obvious that some people don?t know what beautiful prog is. This project is a very fine and nice work from several prog bands but the best of them is deffinetly Glass Hammer. I don?t hear anything to complain about in those vocals. The work is a very intresting and gives a good view over some more and less known progrock bands of the world.
4,Very Informative - good for novice traders,"There is a lot of material in this book that traders should know. Some are minor details, but these are the same details that can determine whether a trade will be profitable. It is divided into three parts towards the end to suit three types of investors: (1) corporate, (2) institutional, and (3) speculator. Obviously not all three will suit you, but you can learn some things from all of them. Take a look."
4,Stick voodoo magic,"I first heard Greg Howard this past summer at a Dave Matthews Concert in Noblesville, Indiana. Greg played the second stage just after the gates opened. As we made our way to our seats we passed the stage and I was magnetically drawn toward the music. I heard what sounded like guitar and bass, but only saw one performer. My jaw dropped as I realized what Mr. Howard was doing. There were no overdubs he was playing it all himself. I knew then I had to hear more of his music. While stick figures doesn't live up to the power of Greg's live performance it is still a great album to relax with. He conjures up images of the late great Michael Hedges. While not as intense as Hedges often was the melodies are often just as good. While I haven't heard any of his other material I wouldn't hesitate to say that this is a good introduction into what he has to offer, and is probably more accessible than his more experimental works such as Sticks and Stones."
3,"Pricey, but it fits","The finish is very smooth stainless and looks beautiful. It is sturdy and well-made. The 3-star rating is because the Kohler model is pricey compared to other models we considered.Because we added the pot-filler to the existing space between the cooktop and the hood, we needed a fixture that was low profile. Two other pot-fillers that we tried were too tall."
5,Great clamp for making your own ropes.,"We bought these because we had a horse that pulled when tied and she broke many ropes. These great clamps allowed us to fix the ropes that broke so we didn't have to buy new lead ropes every week. We've sold the mare, but still use the clamps as we've begun buying rope in spools and make our own lead ropes. Great economical option without skimping on quality."
2,low quality expensive shampoo,"I bought a small sample at a local store and loved it. Decided it would be a better deal buying through Amazon the product was not at all the same. It had a strange chemical odor both Shampoo and conditioner, It was so gross I only used it for a couple days. Too bad I hate wasting money."
1,i would give it 0 stars if i had a choice,"Less than mediocre at best! They should refrain from any form of acting, let alone prancing around like grown monkeys...I am not sure why we tend to celebrate inferiority..."
5,A beautiful book,"This charming book offers a lovely, gentle tale of simpler times. It is beautifully illustrated and designed. Reading ""To Live a Truer Life"" is like paging through a lovely quilt."
5,Fantastic speakers for price,"After several weeks of researching online in an attempt to find the perfect speakers for my very own home theater, I decided to purchase a pair of these speakers from Axiom's factory outlet for $892 and I am glad I did. These speakers have exceeded my expectations and continue to do so the more I listen to them. I have heard things with these speakers that I have never heard before in any theater."
3,Good for school but not for leisure reading,"This was a good book for my cultural diversity class. There was times when the book got a bit preachy, so I'm glad I had a classroom environment to discuss my concerns or any frustrations I had. I wouldn't recommend this book to read on your own time because it can come across a bit biased. But then again a lot of textbooks are like that."
5,"The Acts of the Apostles, Patriarchs and Prophets, the Desire of Ages. {Prophets and Kings","I have to admit that I have not had the time to read the other books that were given to me on my birthday with the new Kendall that was also a birthday gift. Some of them I have read in the original book form, but I am looking forward to reading these books as I travel this summer.It is such a pleasant experience to be able to read from the Kendall in such a small compact way, and not have to carry heavy books. When I fly, the weight of the books will not allow me to take them with me, but with the Kendall, --- what a blessing!I recommend the books so much. This world is in such a mess, they give me hope for the future!"
2,Price too high..,I used this for a class Jeopardy game but it was quite small. I would not order it again because the price was kind of high for what you get.
1,It's really a play,If your intent is to produce a play then buy this book - I was expecting a narative and after 2 pages tossed it in the trash. It was tedious and not even close to what I expected.
4,Panasonic shaver,first time user with a shaver-used a razor for 40 years-took me 3 weeks to see a close shave-did an excellent job with my skin moisten by the shower-easy clean up.Only drawback is the large charger.I would recommend this shaver
1,fake Moen part,"The part I received was not a Moen 1200 cartridge part but a ""made in China"" look alike. I installed it and after a week it was very hard to operate. I replaced it with a real Moen 1200 cartridge and every works perfectly."
5,Moen 1200 replacement cartridge,"Product did fine, was less expensive that hardware stores here. Would recommend it to anybody using Moen faucets. Go WVU"
5,moen 1200 single handle cartridges,"Purchased the moen 1200 single handle cartridges for my older faucets. I have been using an after market brand until I found these at Amazon. In fact I had to replace the kitchen faucet cartridge today, Christmas day. The moen cartridge works like a charm, the hot side is hot and the oold side is cold just like it's supposed to work.Amazon and the Amazon retailer were awesome in shipping the merchandise to me in such a speedy manner during this busy time of year, thank you."
5,A loving tribute to a great announcer,"OK, so this isn't a comprehensive, chronological life of one of the greatest baseball broadcasters of all time. SO WHAT! The fact is, anything on Bob Prince brings me back to my childhood, when i would listen to ""The Gunner"" root the Bucs on to another win. And this book does the job just fine. I stopped rooting for the Pirates, in fact, when they fired Prince (I'm an Orioles fan now, and they did the same stupid thing with another great, Jon Miller). Iron City Beer was the first beer I ever drank -- thanks to Bob Prince. This guy could call a game and make the experiemce a memorable one. I'm just grateful that his art has not gone unremembered; and this book brings back the memories."
3,Too general to be of help,I found the book to be too general to help me with my problem. I found more accurate answers on the internet.
5,Brand new,"Book was exactly as advertised- Book was packaged well, book was shipped fast. Great place for all your automotive publications."
3,So-So,"For some things it serves its purpose minimally, but with others it is downright awful. I've had other Hayne's Repair Manuals in the past and they were definitely better than this one. There have been several times I've looked up various things in this book to see little more than a three-word descriptive and an awful picture that I can't make out. What's the point of buying this book when I have to resort to Google searches?If there are any other alternatives out there I would most likely recommend getting them instead, but if this is your only option then get it and suffer through it."
3,Meh,"I need a manual that gives me detailed information on my car. In this case, A 2002 Pontiac Grand Am. Other Haynes manuals that I have used, like for Volvos, are very detailed and thorough. This one is not. And no one else seems to make one SPECIFICALLY for the Grand Am. Not real happy about this edition."
1,"Two versions, very different.","The product in the photo, Bawls Mints, was absolutely excellent.They replaced them with Bawls Buzz-- the product currently sold, which is absolutely terrible. Like hard candy that was accidentally left on the floor for six months, swept up, and put in the can. Ugh. Makes you want to spit it out afterwards. :(The photo here should be replaced with an actual photo of the disgusting new product."
3,Why so little caffeine?,"There are 75 mints in a tin and each mint has about 1mg of caffeine. Each bottle of the Bawls drink has like 70 maybe 80mg of caffeine in it.So I need to chomp down on all of the mints, just to get a decent amount of caffeine in my system? Don't stiff consumers on the caffeine, use your ""bawls"" and give us what we need!Also the fact that the mints have light carbonation infused in them. Yeah it can be fun to pop like 15 in your mouth pretending to have a seizure, but that doesn't last forever."
3,Bawls Mints,"Nice packaging, sweet, contains caffeine-YUM! Best results are obtained if 8 to 10 are placed in mouth at once, the carbonation is the best part,however, not any taste to speak of."
5,Christmas Folk Music,Elmo & Patsy have some fun Christmas songs as well as funny songs. I enjoy listening to their CD. This is another CD I bought to update my music from cassette tape.
4,christmas music,"I was looking for some redneck christmas music and I thought of amazon instead of looking around town,,got the cd, play itand liked it THANKS amazon.com"
2,"""Grandma"" is Great - But the Dr. Elmo's Album is a better way to get it","Dr. Elmo is the best. It's better to order the Grandma song on one of the more recent, Dr. Elmo CD's. The other songs on those CD's are great. Very clever. By the way, ""Grandma"" is not a ""Parody."" It is an original novelty Christmas song. Patsy does not sing on ""Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer"". It's ALL Dr. Elmo."
5,grandma got run over by a raindeer,"you will love it my grandmother loved this cd and so did i it is fun to sing and dance to,even though me grandma passed on it still brings back old memories of a great time we had."
4,No California or Southwest,"Covers strawberries, brambles, blueberries, and grapes very well. Other vine crops, such as kiwis, are covered too briefly to be of any value.From the first chapter: ""Recommended cultivars are not provided for California and some of the adjoining desert states."""
4,interesting and informative,"Ltos of good information here. The book is divided into chapters of different types of berries. It gives extensive information on varieties, cultural requirements, pruning, etc. It is probably not the only book you'll need on some of these fruits - but it's an excellent overall resource. It even includes some more unusual berries, like currants and lingonberries."
1,If I had read pages 38-41...,"Does it contain lots of useful information? Yes. Would I have bought it had I read pages 38-41? Absolutely not. ""The era of optimism came to an abrupt and crashing halt with the publication of...Rachel Carson's Silent Spring...the book was not a scientifically sound publication... We could not produce enough food to feed the people of the world without these chemicals."" And so on. (Of course, people were not producing food before the chemical companies developed their left over chemical weapons into 'fertilizers'.) As any one can guess, I use organic methods. I have many non-organic gardening books among more than 100 titles but until this one I had not read such nonsense. By the way, before I moved to my current home, I grew raspberries in the shade and got tons of fruits."
4,Braid'S firsT and besT,"this is always my favorite Braid album. why? i love the memories of first hearing the music on here. i bought the LP (silscreened by hand and limited to a super small number of copies) and was taken away by the first time i dropped the needle. at the time i was way more into harder sounding music...lots of screaming and such...so it was great to hear a band using clean singing and challenging music. i was also impressed by the wide range of instruments used on these recordings...piano, sax. many more. the music on this first Braid release is alot more quirky and interesting than their later efforts, which veered more into poppier territory. this is one that's not for everyone..but with songs like ""Angel Falls,"" ""New Dollar Building,"" ""Quarters,"" and the original version of ""Hugs From Boys"", frankiwelfareboyage5 stands up as a solid and exciting debut from a band thhat would go on to more great things."
1,glass was broken of the lid,i gave it to my sister as a gift and she told me its of no use due to chipped glass cover
5,Wow!,"This is my favorite pot! It's beautiful, heats up quickly, and cleans up easily. Stains a bit, as stainless does, but a bit of barkeeper's friend does the trick! Unbelievable piece. Makes me want the entire set, which is what these ""try it"" promo prices are all about. Buy it ... you won't be sorry, but will want more!"
4,Not Really Dishwasher Safe,"One of the first things you'll notice when you pull this pan from the box is the slip of paper mentioning that dishwashing is not recommended and will void the warranty on this pan.It's a great pan, solid and heavy with the best grip handle I've seen on a high end piece. It's a good replacement now my anodized is getting old.But I dinged them a star because I hate false advertizing."
3,All you do is fight,"maybe thats the point in dragon ball z but theres much more to the show then just fighting i have dbz bt 1 and 2 but i dont like games where all you do is fight i got bt thinking it was an open world game of dragon ball z i have had one before and loved it sadly it was a rental the game in witch you can walk around and stuff (open world) is dragon ball z sagasDragonball Z Sagas,although i don't personally like this game its not bad some other people might think a game in witch all you do is fight fits dragon ball z perfectly but not me people have their on opinion."
4,Really Fun,The game was really fun and it too k a long time to play the game. It was really fun because their were alot of characters to choose from and it was time consuming.
3,I don't like the camera angle's.,"Ok everything about this game is good except the camera angles during battle. I liked it when you could actually see both you and your oponnents on the same screen,and it's even worse in split screen! Especially when your winning and your oponnent goes into hiding!! Overall this game has alot of characters, great moves but horrible camera angles."
2,the worst game ever,this game sucks when my cousin came over he couldn't beat raditz after 18 tries and he was freaken cryin i meen come on man this games supposed to be fun and make people happy so anyway i took the control and started playing it took me 10 tries to beat this dude i swear this may be the first time i've played tis game but i would never lie hear me out don't buy this game please.
1,it..well..i dont know?,Okay look here i dont know if it was a S&H problem but this game did not work well i mean it did work but it would freeze up in the middle of anything i tried to do....Overall this was Terrible i am NEVER buying from you again Good day! -__-
4,"Awesome game, but....","The camera issues got on my nerves. Also, the varity of attacks was limited...Storys were repetitive too... But on the positve side, Incredible Graphics, Over 50 charactors including burtur, SS4 Gogeta, and others. And best of all, YOU CAN STAY IN FUSIONS FOREVER! At the end of a battle, the person who lost is all beaten and bruised. The controls are a bit confuesing at first, but you start too get it veeery quickly. Long game too! We STILL didnt have all the charactors after 4 days of playing. JANEMBA IS AWESOME! TRY AND WIN HIM!"
1,"Please Don't BUY This Game, unless you like JUNK","First and fore most, This will never be a True Budokai game. I say this because the graphics are like the Sagas game just a tad better.But we all Know Sagas was junk too. The controls are really slow, I would press block and it would hold it until the comp stop hitting me and i had no way of fighting back. This is the worst Game they have made for the DGZ series. The game features ways to fuse capsules together,though this sounds pretty cool it's Lame. There are really no good points to this game except the CG demo in the begining. That was the only thing I liked about the game. If they could have used the Last Bodukai as a reference and just added different stories they would have gotten a A+ but this is at best a F-. If you like fight twenty matches just to beat Raditz once than this game is for you. If your a true fan RENT this FIRST to see how bad it is. You might not be a fan of the Kamahamaha after this."
2,Atari got this game all wrong,I can't tell you how excited I was to hear that there would be a new Dragon Ball Z game for the PS2! For months I waited and then finally it was released. My girlfriend bought me this for my birthday (a mistake because I ALWAYS rent games first before buying). There's a good reason for this. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi is mediocre at best. The control system is horrible and anyone who loved the old control system is going to be VERY disappointed. I could go on and on about my disappointment in this game but I won't. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi is going to sit in my cabinet collecting dust while I play the only truly awesome DBZ game...Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3!! At least I have that!
1,Lame.,"This game is Horrible. I could deal with the angle changes, but the controls are horrible.Too fast-paced, horrible controls and stupin scenarios.Lame."
3,this is an exellent game with some issues. RECOMMENDED if you are a dbz fan,"ISSUES:The soundtrack sucks, its the same as all the other budokais, they sould change it.The computer always does the same moves and its annoying.You can't transform during the battle, you have to choose your transformation wen you pick your character.The cameras sometimes get on my nerves.GOOD POINTS:This game is very fun to play in its 3-d arena and with awesome graphics but like every other video games it isn't perfect."
5,The most original DB/Z/GT game ever!!!!,"Okay so I bought this game on Sunday and beat it yesterday (Thursday). That's how addicting this game is. IT is so much better than the other budokais and sagas. It combines the best of both games into one---so yes that means all new controls oo, but it makes the gameplay better. Almost the entire epic of DB/Z/GT is told in this game. It's amazing with the coolest graphics ever. And also, there are over 80 playable characters. That's right. So if you don't have this game, go get it now!!!!!"
4,should come in frosted bottle not clear glass one,"i like charlie red it reminds me of the way my mommy use to smell :) **i like it in the frosted bottle, not the clear glass bottle though"
5,Love It .,"What can I say? This is one of my favorite products and favorite fragrances. Yes, to say I love it is the truth!!"
1,Bad,"I did not like the smell at all, as he had used Used See by, I can say it's a fake! please, if you're not going to sell something original, make the reservation or do not sell"
5,Portmerion 81/2 inch Plates,"I love this quality set, I certainly will shop again in this websitePortmeirion Botanic Garden Salad Plates 8-1/2-Inch, Set of 6.Cherry from New Zealand"
5,Lives up to it's promise!,"I recently read that your mattress doubles it's weight over it's lifetime with all the moisture and skin that you leave behind at night--gross right? So I bought one these when I got my new mattress last summer. I love it! I have 2 long-hair cats who like to leave me ""presents"" and the protector kept the mess from seeping through to my new mattress. It washes easily as well. I thought it might be noisy, but you can't even feel or hear it when it's on the bed. I have given 3 as gifts.A friend bought 2 for his 2 year old and if she has an accident during the night they can quickly remake the bed and get everyone back to sleep. They appreciate keeping her bed clean and healthy so she can use it for years to come."
2,Average primer but badly needs an update,"For the average newcomer to investing this is an OK book, but it does focus alot on subjects you probably do not need to know unless you plan on working for a brokerage firm. It does give good descriptions and examples of all the security instruments (stocks, bonds, options, futures, etc.) but it accounts for only about 50% of the book. The rest is in my opinion redundant to the lay-person and is in places woefully out of date (especially the taxation section). If updated, I would rate this a 4, but given the age of the text, I would recommend looking elsewhere for an introduction to financial markets."
5,Great Item - Terrible packaging so have some patience,"I ordered a pair of these Kohler sinks to go in our new granite tops for our bathroom addition. As indicated previously, the sink (porcelain) was placed in a larger box - with what can only be described as wholly inadequate packing material to protect something that is basically glass.The first shipment was 2 for 2 for broken sinks delivered by UPS. I retaped the boxes and returned to the local UPS store. The next round was 1 intact and 1 broken - and returned via the UPS store. Replacement #2 - broken again. Finally - we hit the sink lottery and the second arrived safe. The whole process took about a month - so if you are under time constraints, you might pay the bigger ticket to get them quicker.I will say Amazon took the broken sinks back - no questions asked. It was very smooth and courteous if you dont count the trips to the UPS store."
2,A little false pretences,"I have given this book only 2 stars to adjust the 2 x 5 star reviews (these reviews being the reason why I bought the book). This book is not ""The world of the Pharaohs"" rather ""The world of Egyptian Archaeologists and Egyptologists. There is almost as much text on these people than on the Pharaohs and after a while becomes annoying. Also ""A complete history to Ancient Egypt"" is not possible in 192 pages.The book is Ok as an introduction if one understands and accepts the authors fascination with the Egyptologists etc., but there is very little background to the Pharaohs and Ancient Egyptian details in general (which is clear with the limited number of pages). I found myself checking for real background in Wikipedia, which shows how it should be done.There must be much better books out there, that concentrate on the facts of the period and the civilization of Eygpt and not the 19th and 20th century discoverers of it."
3,ok,Just as described. No issues and was shipped fast. Good product and but had to figure out how to secure it. No problem with this company and received just as they said.
1,Does not fit listed applications,"This reservoir does not fit 88-94 Chevrolet GMC full size trucks as stated. Not even a close fit, may fit the other listed application."
1,Incorrect for application stated by your fitment guide,"This does not fit a 1989 Chevrolet K2500Engine: 5.7L V8 Gas OHV Distributor-Breakerless Naturally Aspirated TBI Electronic FI TBITrim: Silveradoas stated by your fitment guide PLEASE correct, this is the first part that I have received wrong or incorrect by the fitment guide.This appears to be for a Van."
5,Great buy,I have had several of my window motors to go out and each time I have ordered one from this sight it has worked and this one is no different.
2,Suspect,when i got my product everything looked fine no broken pieces. i had it installed (paid) to realize that it didnt have the right connector to hook up to my 05 lincoln ls. so i had to pay again to have it taken off and pay again to have it shipped back. needeless to say i still havent found the piece i need at a resonable price.
2,OK...,"First I ordered it with the prime two day shipping. That was good it came as promised nicely packed and all. Everything was good until i went to put a bolt on the top of the front rail, the screw thats made into the thing just broke off!! so now it works with just the two bottom screws but theres also some funny crinkle noise coming from it when i let it all the way down. I think tonight im going to contact someone about it and see if i can get an exchange soon, I need it replaces asap cause its starting to get rainy around here"
5,Works great,"Quality seems fine. Mounts up fine. Works fine. Not much else to say other than it was much less expensive than OEM, or even buying this same unit locally ($95 in store). Lincoln LS has one of the easiest regulators to replace of any that I have worked on. This could be done in 30 minutes if you have done it before."
2,I did not get the Projector Mount shown in picture,"The Projector Mount received was not the one advertised on the Amazon website. I seriously doubt that the item delivered was a Mustang MV-PROJSP Universal Projector Mount as advertised here. I Google the model that I ordered here and I could not find a picture matching the item shipped to me.Pro: Delivery was promptItem worksCons: Item received was totally different from the one advertisedItem came with no documentationItem did not offer some of the features advertisedI was able to install and use item received, but it did not offer any height adjustment as advertised. Also, I should mention that this Projector Mount came without any documentation.Beware, you may not get what you think you're ordering!B. Rob"
3,"Wrong Picture...Title Correct ""LOW PROFILE""""","The MV-PROJSP is made in both a ""regular"" and ""low-profile""/flush flavors. Apparently they are sending the FLUSH mount instead of the one capable of extending. Both are good products, but you should be getting what is pictures/advertised. The description states: ""It offers an adjustable length, 11.42""-32"", and supports small to medium-sized projectors weighing up to 33 lbs (15 kg)."" The flush mount DOES NOT provide length adjustment. Amazon needs to fix this one."
4,Speed Grapher box set,I bought this set knowing how good the series was as I saw it online. I was very impressed with how nice the box set was put together and the extra 6 guide books that come with it. Also to my surprise the whole box set had a shiny holographic over it making that much more attractive. Why 4/5 stars. Well it wasnt the product it was the shipper caused minor damage but besides that I was very satisfied.
5,nice product and timely shipping...,Speed Grapher: Box SetThe box set was in great shape no scratches... and delivery was about 3 to 4 days... I will buy agian from this vendor... rob
5,Fantastic,I use it at work and it really keeps prying eyes away from my screen - even when someone is sitting right next to me. You see the screen and they don't.
4,Privacy Screen,"Best purchase I've made in a while. I get so frustrated with people reading over my shoulder in general. This privacy filter makes your screen look black to other people looking from an angle (on the train, plane, in the office, etc) but clear to you. It is a tiny bit dark for the user but well worth it for me."
4,Very good product,easy to install and very effective.. only gripe is that the screen curves and sometimes gets hard to slide in.
4,excellent product,"the filter is what I expected. It is not too dark, and light reflection much less. it feel comfortable to my eye."
3,Like what other's have said: Doesn't work like advertised.,"I got a this item because my desk area at work is in front of others. Additionally, I often travel and have curious eyes. This however only worked when I had my screen brightness dimmed to the lowest. When It was slightly brightened, the screen is still visible in all angle. Yes, in all angle. I understand if it would be blocked in a slightly less of a degree but not in this case. So It makes some work more difficult because the backlighting is set so dim to work. For those that usually set their screen brightness at a low level by default, then this item will work like a charm. Otherwise, please be advised. After a while, I got use to the dim setting."
2,"Limited ""Privacy""","I purchased this privacy screen to assist in keeping sensitive data ""private"" both in the office environment, and in airports and on planes during frequent travel. It works well for blocking visiability when trying to view the screen from left or right angles, but not for looking ""straight"" at the screen. As such, the screen is often fully visable to anyone walking down an isle at work (when working in cubes) walking down the isle on airplanes (if seated in an isle seat), seated in an isle seat behind you on a plane, or at various angles behind you in an airport. I understand that it is likely hard to block this type of viewing, and still make the screen viewable to the user. However, prior to spending so much to purchase this (or any) privacy screen, please keep in mind that the privacy provided is limited. As such, the screem can easily lead to a false sense of privacy."
4,Happy with my privacy,"It certainly does its job of making it difficult for other people to see your screen. I just wish it fit my laptop screen much better, as it didn't fit mine 100%...but not the filter's fault, I think with the varying sizes of laptop screens for the various brands...it's really not as easy to find a perfect fit."
1,De-laminated within a month.,"The product behaved as promised initially, but after using it for less than a month, two layers of the film began de-laminating, leaving it unusable. What a waste of $45!"
3,semi-private and snazzy looking,"I've had this filter for some time. i think its fairly effective. most people tell me they see the gold and think i'm using it as a mirror or something. most people are usually standing over my shoulder but can't see my text. i think if someone is withing 30-120 degree in front of the screen they can see all images.overall i think its pretty basic except for the additional color of ""reddish gold""."
4,S'all Right,"Pros: Perfect Fit, does what it's suppose to,Cons: Hard to determine which one to get. I relied on actual measurements and it luckily was correct. Scratches way to easily. I suggest removing the screen each time. Do not leave it in the laptop when closing."
5,Excellent!!!,"This is about 3-4 times better than the black filter. I had to purchase this for my 12.5"" Widescreen dell because the black was sold out. I got if for a better price than the black, and it's GREAT!!! unless you're basically directly in front of the screen you can't see anything but GOLD!!! love it love it love it!!!"
2,decent but viewing angle still to wide,"I have an IBM T42 laptop with a 14"" LCD and the Filter fits the screen well. However, I have noticed that most of the sticky tabs provided with the package are necessary for the screen to stay in place.The viewing angle is still too wide. Someone sitting right next to you can easily see everything on your screen - unlike what is suggested on the back of the package."
2,"Does What it's supposed to do, but...","Really bad glare/reflection. And it has a lot of static cling. Also, the tabs it comes with to ""mount"" it to the screen are intrusive to the display. They are clear, but they are tabs that extend into the screen. I had to move them a few times so I would be able to see the minimize/maximize buttons in the corner, etc. Overall it's ok, but the way it mounts to the screen could be better."
3,Privacy with a gold glossy glare,"I must say the product do what it is mean to doBut I have been using it for a week and I still don't get use to glare the screen madeI have try using backwards whit the gold side looking inside the screenI still provide Privacy but know with a dark glare (instead of the golden one)the Dark glare is less disturbing but still to glossy for me.Also what I don't like is that the privacy filter works only to block people next to you, and not above you or far next to you."
3,Meh,"1. Very susceptible to fingerprints2. VERY REFLECTIVE3. VERY Hard to keep in place. The stickies provided to hold it to the screen keep falling - and yes, I did clean the area with a solvent before applying them."
2,Be warned.,"This product is a let-down. Technically, it does narrow the viewing angle effectively, making it hard for ""neighbors"" to view the lap top screen. However, the ""installation"" is nothing more than attaching flimsly little adhesive strips to the monitor frame! These look bad, hardly work, and won't last more than a few days on the road. Additionally, the filter affects the on-axis screen brightness more than just a little, to an unacceptable level for this user.This filter is practically useless for the business traveler with a laptop and is extremely overpriced, especially for something that is likely to fail in short order. An appropriate price might be $10 or less.Disappointed!"
2,Beware - not as private as you think....,"New laptop means a new screen - my previous 3M Privacy Screen was 2-years old, and this new one isn't as private as the old one. Clearly, airline seat neighbors can see your screen, albeit with deteriorated graphics. The worst part is you may be lulled into a sense of privacy, but are actually viewable. BOTTOM LINE: Better than nothing, but not great."
3,"Not all its cracked up to be, but better than nothing","At first when I put this screen on and examined my monitor from the side, it looked just like I had turned down the brightness a lot. You could still see all the content on the screen.However, I later found the trick to using this screen is that you have to turn your own monitor brightness down to zero. Once your monitor is as dark as it can get, then it serves nearly the function that it is advertised to serve. Be aware that with the dark screen on and the brightness down, you are looking at a very dark projection. But in those circumstances, it will provide you adequate privacy from side viewing."
1,The Glare is Horrible!!!,"It lists this as being anti-glare, but the glare is magnified 5+ times with this thing installed. I chose this screen protector for its anti-glare properties, the privacy filter was a bonus. There goes $40."
3,Wish It Were Wider,"This item functions as well as the 3m Privacy Filter I use on my BlackBerry Tour. I use this item on my Dell XPS 17, which has a 17.3"" FHD (1080p) 3D Display. The filter is double-sided, glossy and matte, but it is not labeled so it is difficult to detect which side is which. In addition, the filter leaves a margin of screen exposed at the top, which is highly noticeable because of the contrast."
4,3M Gold Privacy filter,"This filter works as suggested, it's impossible to see anything if your head doesn't be positioned at least 45 degrees of the screen. If you be positioned just beside the computer (for example at an airplane seat) your privacy will be garanteed.An important observation is the fact of losing visualization quality using this filter, taking off bright and contrast. But it's not a big problem if you want to use just for a few hours a day.The filter is attached at the screen using some sticks but you still can use without any stick because the size fits well at the screen and the gravity will keep it fixed."
2,Doesn't work with Dell E4310 13.3 inch screen,"While there were excellent reviews for this Privacy Filter for other laptop screen sizes, the filter I ordered for my Dell E4310 business laptop3M Privacy Filter for 13.3 Inch Widescreen Laptop (PF13.3W)was not wide enough to reach the edges of my screen, and it was too tall to fit the screen. The tabs that were included in the product didn't appear to help keep the filter in place, either. 3M does make good products, but this one just didn't fit the bill.Fortunately, Amazon's shipping service was great - I did receive it within the timeframe I selected. Unfortunately, the product just didn't fit my laptop."
1,Review for MAC users only....,"This privacy screen is not intended to be used on flat flushed MAC screens (definitely not the MACbook Pro) but rather intended for PC's with a slight rectangular recessed monitor. This becomes important because the ""tape"" that holds the privacy screen does not compensate the flatness of MAC screens, therefore, presses the privacy screen very tightly creating air bubbles that is VERY visible. Solution: 3M PFMP13 laptop privacy filter MacBook Pro 13"" (PFMP13). This is meant for MAC and I believe this compensates the flatness and would not create air bubbles when installed... I haven't bought one yet but soon... hope this helps..."
1,Privacy filter review,I've had a similar product for dell laptops and it worked well. For the Macbook pro it did not work at all. The screen for the Macbook is completely different and the glue didn't adhere to the surface. I returned it after 2 weeks to Amazon with no issues.
3,not what I searched for,"I searched for an anti-glare screen filter. I was hoping to find one better than one I had purchased earlier from a different seller. As it turned out, this is not an anti-glare filter at all. I suppose it does what it purports to do - prevent others from viewing the screen - but I'm irritated that it popped up as what I had searched for when it really was not. I am not sure whether that's the seller's fault or Amazon's fault. Probably my fault for being naive. Because of the inaccurate search, I must give this item a neutral review. It is not what I wanted and I believed that it was exactly what I wanted when I ordered it."
3,Dissapointed in this product.,"It does mostly block people from looking at the screen from the side, but I was disappointed about how badly it degrades MY view of the screen. It's so dark that for the first few days I was taking it on/off several times a day... Now, mostly, it just stays off. I was also not thrilled with the fit and finish."
2,Too Expensive,This product is too expensive for what it does. If your in front of the computer you can see every thing. You have to be on an angle for this probuct to work.
1,Increases glare,"On an Inspiron 8000, this product actually manages to increase the glare both indoors and especially out. Different viewing angles and flipping it over doesn't improve the situation."
1,Do not order for Macbook Air,3M should really let you know not to buy this for your Macbook Air. It does not work. I've had privacy screens for more than 10 years and this one does not work with the Macbook Air. When I spoke with the 3M service line they said they already know but yet they still try to sell it. Don't buy it or you'll waste your time and money.
3,3M Privacy Filter Notebook Privacy Filter Review,"Easy to install;although instructions not clear as to which side is the 'right' side to face the user.Expected smaller angle of privacy; meaning that even my next seat neighour is unable to see my screen...in this case; unless the person is more than 45 degrees away from the perpendicular line of vision, he is still able to read the screen."
2,Doesn't Stop Prying Eyes,"This product doesn't blacken out the screen at an angle like it says it does. You can clearly still see what's going on on the screen unless you're practically 90 degrees on the side...almost parallel to it. So, if you're on a plane, people sitting next to you on either side will still be able to clearly see what you're doing on the computer and what you're typing. This is really disapointing b/c I was expecting it to do what it says it does.Also the price is wayyyyy too much for this product. Even if it did what is said it does, it's too much money.I would still get this product, however. The reason is b/c there's isn't a better or cheaper product like this that I know of. And eventhough people can still read your screen and you don't have privacy...you do make it harder for them and it is not as easy for them to read or look at. It is better than nothing...but if someone really wants to snoop, it won't stop them."
4,Well packaged.,"Bought this used and was very impressed with the condition, shipping time and especially the packaging. Only negative it that this particular screen protector does not have the grooves that really help with off axis view blocking. Which was what I was hoping for. This one is merely a piece of tinted plastic. My fault for not asking I suppose."
1,Does not provide any privacy,"This ""privacy"" filter doesn't actually provide any privacy. I deal with sensitive data at work all day and so need to protect my laptop with a filter. However, no matter what angle you're looking at the screen, you can very clearly see the image on the screen. The product literally does not work at all on my laptop."
2,missing side tabes,Received the package;Privacy filter is in okay state but I'm missing the side tab's to hold the screen.Side tab's should have been included
2,Dark Lines for Antiglare Display,"I got this for the new Macbook Pro (MBP) 15"". I upgraded the screen to Antiglare Widescreen Display. When I put this privacy filter on top of the display, it created many dark lines. This made my eyes tired after working for 10 minutes. I tested this with my old MBP with the standard glossy display, I didn't see the same dark lines. I recommend people who has an Antiglare display to stay away from this product."
4,"Love it, great for nosey clients.","If you are a consultant and you have nosey clients. YOU NEED THIS.If your clients require you to share a cube. YOU NEED THIS.If you travel and need to work in busy places. YOU NEED THIS.Just sayin, you need this.Sometimes the filter slides out of place. I wish they provided more filter holders but other than that a great product."
4,Very Nice!,"I purchased this for my T43 IBM ThinkPad. It fit nicely. The screen holders look slightly flimsy, but I don't take the screen off. I leave it on even when I shut down. I find it very nice for travelling. I don't have to worry about someone 2ft away from me viewing my desktop. Although it does not completely shut out prying eyes, it does limit. Your neighbors will be able see what you are viewing, but not very clearly. I was hesitant about the purchase but now that I have it, I find that I am less reluctant to work when someone is next to me."
4,awesome product,"Only thing is the Price, but one has to be careful and try to use all the stickies to keep this in place"
1,Did not work as shown,"I bought one of these for my 17"" monitor and I HATED it. One of my employees wanted one as well so I bought the 19"" for him. For some reason it works wonderfully for him! Maybe it was the angle of the screen? On my monitor it cast a bad gold glow over everything but on his it is clear. I have an older monitor so maybe just the pitch of the glass does not allow for this type of screen. Anyway, he loves it and it looks cool too. Bummed I can't use it too."
2,Waste of money --,"It doesn't give much privacy. You can definitely see what is on the screen. As the viewing angle increases, it reduces the brigtness but still you can easily recognize popular websites and applications."
5,3M privacy filter 15.6 inch widescreen for laptop,This is very high quality filter. Works very well was very easy to install Woodridge would recommend this to anyone. A must have once again very high quality.
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This One,"Just bought 2 3M privacy filters online for my MacBook and 22"" monitor. I assumed the 3M brand would guarantee a great product, but these filters are HUGE let down! I got the 15"" mainly for privacy when I'm on a plane viewing company-sensitive data. But I tested the filter in the office for viewing angle, and unfortunately you can still clearly read the info on the laptop from either side-angle. All it really does is darken the screen a few shades. A total bummer! This product is totally worthless. I'd suggest visiting a local office supply store and comparing several privacy filters FIRST (like Sony, Fellowes, HP, Kantek, Kensington and Targus) - for viewing angle!!! - before buying one. BTW, if you know which one has the tightest viewing angle - please let me know."
4,Excellent Product.,I was hesitant to spend the money for a screen filter but my current work area has zero privacy and people are able to view others screens readily. So I bit the bullet and ordered this 3M filter. Ordering was easy with very informative selection information. I received the filter and completed the very easy installation. WOW! What a difference. Privacy is excelllent. I'll never be without one again.
4,Does The Job,"Very happy with this 3M Filter overall. It does have a couple of minor scratches & a slight bend, but these are pretty negligible. They're barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The package arrived very quickly and several days earlier than expected--so I was very happy about that. The package was a little beat up, but the filter was well protected. Overall, good deal, especially for the price."
2,Eh.,There is a very (VERY) limited area where screen is dark from onlookers. Wish I didn't buy this.
1,"13.3"" MacBook Pro","Claims to fit a 13.3 "" MacBook Pro. Doesn't fit and doesn't provided any privacy due to the brightness of the MacBook Pro's screen."
4,3M WIDESCREEN PRIVACY FILTER FOR LAPTOP,"I just wanted to offer a helpful suggestion for those of you who ordered the 3M Privacy Screen for their laptops and are having problems (as I did) with those sticky tabs to hold it in place. I think those tabs are ugly, tacky and cheapened the look of my Macbook Pro and just plain didn't work. The screen wouldn't stay in place so I replaced the tabs with ""photo corners""; you know those tiny transparent/pressure sensitive tabs that are used in homemade picture albums (only used on the corners of photos). They worked great and looked so much better-I think 3M should consider using these instead. You can imagine your laptop display is now ""framed"" picture perfect! And...you still have the flexibility of being able to remove the privacy screen without disturbing the tabs! A definite 200% improvement!!"
4,Good product but product technology hasnt kept up with LED screens,"I've used 3M Privacy Filters for 3 years now and they are all high quality products, including this one. My only complaint is that I finally upgraded to a laptop with an LED screen and because of how bright the screen is, the angles that this filter is still effective has shrunk considerably from the last filter I had on an LCD screen. It's probably unavoidable but I was hoping this filter would get the job done without having to lower my screen brightness.Overall solid product though and worth the purchase."
1,Privacy that doesn't work,"If you are looking for privacy, don't buy this since product does not work as advertised, I can see my pc almost the same, viewable area is like 180 degrees, yes it dark your area if you are not in front but still you can clearly see what you have in your pc/notebook when you are not directly in front."
4,Does what it's supposed to do!,This privacy filter works well. I sit in an open office environment where persons frequently pass by. This alows me to maintain some privacy and not have to worry about prying eyes.
1,Worst product EVER,"The person who designed this should be drawn and quartered. Completely useless. It falls off, considerably reduces resolution and over all should be an embarrassment to 3M. I'v never spent more money for less in my life!! If there was a negative five star rating they'd have gotten that.3M Gold Privacy Filter - 3M GPF14.1W Widescreen Notebook privacy screen"
1,loved it until day 2,"got the product as described and loved the color and thickness of it. it slid in perfectly and i had an entire day of greatness, but on day TWO, the bottom right corner split apart!! like how a split nail does, the layers just came apart from the corner and has now split about an inch in. so sad/mad/dissapointed/upset that i spent FOURTY DOLLARS on a piece o' c."
2,Wouldn't fir T420 Lenevo,"This product is effective, but this doesnt fit T420 Lenevo 14.1 "" screen. I dont know why probably they shipped me a different dimension filter not satisfied with that part for sure as I cant use it because I need to remove the filter each time I close the lid. Hope it helps other buyers with T420 Lenevo."
3,"Okay for privacy, too small, tabs ineffective.","I thought it was a great price compared to those out there. I measured my screen as instructed, but it was too small. I thought it was more likely to be too big, but it was too small in width. Tabs are really cheap and are coming off already. Attracts dusts, lint, and hair. I wish they would just design a software that would alter the screen electronically... or actually include privacy screens with electronics... built specifically for the item. Anyways, this was the exact product that HP recommended for my laptop.I'm not sure if this will help, not sure if there are better options out there. I'm not upset, just not that impressed about this product. I will use it until it no longer stays on... Then I will try harder to find a store that actually carries these, and bring my laptop in with me."
5,WORKS PERFECTLY!!!,"I really think the people who are stating it does not work have it on backwards. The shiny side should face AWAY from the monitor. You'll know it's on correctly because you will only see a black screen at an angle...from a distance. Depending on where the other person is standing, the screen will appear to be black, while it is perfectly legible for you (as you are directly behind the monitor). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Don't let those bad reviews fool you. I'm telling you this works perfectly, and I mean it."
2,Too glossy,"It does what it should be doing (privacy), but you will pay the price: the screen become way to reflective (I can see myself in it even with regular daylight). If you're working only in the darkness or doesn't mind extra ""mirror-effect"" then it will work for you. Otherwise I can't recommend this filter. Returning it...."
4,Does the trick,"This works , and works well. I use it all the time. Only issue I have is the small semi circle on the top, which gives away the filter. Also, I wish it would cling to the screen, instead of depending on tabs."
4,Very Good Product,The privacy filter seems to work very well. It's not going to completely conceal videos that you watch from the person sitting next to you as you can make out what is going on. Overall very good though.
2,Of Little Help,The HP laptop I have is very difficult to view out of doors. I had hoped that this filter would help but it hasn't in the least. As a privacy filter it is average as you have to go 90 degrees before full privacy.
5,Love it!,"Bought this screen for my new HP Pavilion dm1-4170us with the 11.6 inch screen. It has been fantastic. I fly a lot and it is comforting that the person next to me cannot look over my shoulder. People really have to be right up on you in order to see the screen. Had to replace my computer and had used up all of my little tabs on the old screen, but the 3M company sent me brand-new tabs for no charge. Great product!"
5,"Great, brand new product - no instructions...",This is the 3M product selling for upwards of $65 in retail outlets. This provider sells the same piece without fancy packaging via US Mail for under $15.00! Great value.
1,Absolute waste of money!,"I bought this privacy filter so that no one would be able to view my laptop screen from any angle. To my disappointment, this product is more of an anti-glare screen because that is about all that is does. People can see your screen from basically any angle. I tested this product amongst my co-workers and they were each able to see my laptop screen as if it had nothing covering the screen."
3,tabs,"I didn't realize when I ordered it that this screen doesn't stick to your monitor, it has to be held in place by tabs that stick to the monitor's frame. It does the jobs, but the tabs interfere with visibility around the edges, and the screen slides around a little, so it's not really appropriate for a touch sensitive monitor."
2,"Good Privacy, Too much glare","Very effective at protecting privacy. Impossible to view the screen from an angle. BUT, way too much glare...reading the edges of the screen is nearly impossible, even looking straight on."
1,"Terrible product, Read why","First of all the product does not totally inhibit the ability of someone sitting next to you on an airplane seeing your screen, it just creates a more dark shadow of what's on your screen. Second, if your screen did not have a glare before it will now with this product. Third, there is a distracting notch at the top of the filter so you have this annoying thumb sized area and the filter does not cover. Do not waste you money on this 3M so-called privacy filter."
1,Not good,"I ordered the privacy filter because I sit on the outside cube in my office. All my coworkers walking past me can see right through it, like it's not there. It offers no privacy at all, disappointed and now have to find another product."
4,Works with Samsung Series 9 11.6 inch screen,"I feel sorry for MBA owners who find this privacy filter to be unusable. It works fine on my machine, though the filter is not a perfect fit for the screen, i.e., it leaves about one or two millimeters of gap horizontally and vertically. I take off one star because the plastic tabs that hold the filter in place can be an eyesore."
2,"13.3"" does not fit the Macbook Air 13","The PF13.3 (measured 7.99x10.63 does not fit the macbook air 13 as it is said to, I will have to figure out how to return this now that I've found out a bit too late"
2,Ineffective and Not Worth the Money,Doesn't provide any relief against glare. And one can view the contents of the screen through a fairly wide angle - about 30 degrees. Not worth the price.
5,Excellent privacy solution when flying,I decided to buy this product after a recent flight. I was watching Team America - World Police and had to scramble to close my laptop when a couple of puppets started to do the wild thing. Who knew? I didn't want my seat neighbor to think I was some kind of perv with a puppet fetish.Now that I have the screen I always use it on the plane and in airports. It frees me to work on everything from sensitive business documents to my own creative writing without worrying about prying eyes.The screen has such a narrow line of sight that it even works in coach where you are almost sitting on your neighbor's lap.
1,Useless product,This in no way provides privacy. everyone who passes even 10 feet away can see what you are seeing on your screen. This is a fine example of useless expensive product.Do not buy this.
1,"Obtrusive, unstable, & Ineffective","I should have heeded the 1-star reviews.The screen itself sits poorly against the monitor screen of my laptop, as the provided holding tabs only confine the screen to the chassis and in no way press it flush with the actual plane of the LCD. The tabs themselves are intrusive and garish at the edges of the screen. Something about the screen (I presume the filtering technology) makes an eye-straining Moir√© pattern even when directly facing the screen, and when facing the screen the edges are slightly dim. The cutout tab at the top is also visually distracting.I should have heeded the other customer reviews and customer-supplied imagery - the official product information does not reflect the screen's form or mounting system properly at all."
5,Great Privacy Screen,This privacy screen is different than any other with its shiny look. It certainly looks better than the Black ones.
5,Great Privacy Screen,"Bought 2 privacy screen to be installed (which was very easy) on my wife's computer and mine. We travel a lot and even when I seat beside her I can't see what she is looking at on her computer screen, this privacy screen turns out to be very curious people deterrent, no more having to move to spaces that are uncomfortable to do some extra work at the airports and club rooms. It just take one glance from the curious person to see a golden screen and that's it, no more looking into my screen.We have been using it for over 2 weeks and we don't have any complaints."
3,Measure *BEFORE* you buy,"I am a typical Amazon customer subject to buying things far too quickly because of how easy Amazon makes it.Better think twice before ordering this gem of a privacy filter. I quickly ordered the 12.1 version of the 3M gold filter for my... 12.1"" netbook - a MSI Wind U230.I get the filter, it looks great, just it doesn't come close to covering the whole screen, on either side. There is a 0.25-0.50"" gap on both sides. That's not very private. Why specify 12.1"" when you aren't supposed to purchase by the diagonal measurements?I used a larger one to get by, but I do not recommend cutting these things down as some reviewers have mentioned. It creates a wavy effect that makes it near useless. Only buy this if it matches your screen measurements exactly. Then it is a great product.HTH!"
1,macbook pro,i read a previous review stating that this fits the macbook pro. it does not; it's too short vertically and too wide horizontally. i had to return it.
1,Privacy with no privacy,I am not happy with my privacy screen. My screen can be seen from more angles than the company publish.
2,Terrible,"Wouldn't waste your time. The quality of the filter itself is top notch, both in privacy and glare reduction. But the filter is too small for my screen and, even worse, within one hour of first applying the adhesive tabs that came with the filter they fell off. What good is a filter that won't even stay on?"
4,ONE CLICK !!,"One click is all it takes and NOTHING can stop that order! (that's why they call it one click) I got suckered in buying another one. All I did was click here and it was ordered and no one could stop that order !!I stopped using amazon.com because of their problem. GOOD 3M product, BAD ordering process !(amazon.com)"
1,Doesn't work unless you are next to monitor,The viewing field with this product in place is far too wide. You can stand 45 degrees from the monitor and still see the screen. You practically have to be standing at a 90 degree angle from the screen to have it blank out. Most LCD monitors are difficult to read from that angle anyways.Returned mine.
5,Smaller privacy filter,"This was great due to the smaller laptop used for traveling. The privacy screen fit perfect and such a great price, comparing to the other brands. 3M came through again!"
1,AWFUL,This does not fit the standard white macbook. I ordered it in the hopes that it did and was very disappointed.
2,Not Worth the Price,"1. It is an effective filter. Viewed from the sides, you see nothing but black2. If you have a ""14.1 inch screen"", as many laptops do, it does NOT mean that this is a perfect fit.3. Don't try hand-trimming with a pair of scissors. You'll be disappointed. I used the paper slicer at the office to trim some height, and there's a 1/16 of an inch or so I wish I could have back. May seem trivial, but the gap really shows.4. Biggest problem: it doesn't self-adhere, and the adhesive tabs provided for mounting are just lousy. They don't hold anything at all in place. when you open and close your laptop, there's the privacy filter, laying on your keyboard."
3,wrong size,"the product is fine, but they sent me the wrong size. The sent a 14"" instead of the 15"" poor quality control."
4,Good Privacy Screen,"It does the job and helps reduce glare for eye strain, which is a huge reason why I purchased filter. Privacy only works through side angle and sticky tabs used to keep filter on unstick easily. Have to press down on them almost daily. Wish there was an easier way to keep screen on. Overall worth it to protect vision."
5,filter,5 stars it does the job of keeping my computer safe it got here fast and easy to install a very good buy
2,"Ok, not as good as others","From a privacy perspective, it does well in that anything out of the angle described has your text blurry so people can't see what you're typing from the side. But for total blackout, that requires a very low screen brightness, which is not necessarily something I like, but can deal with.Plus, at the corners of the screen, where obviously my view is at an angle, I can see some reflection of my screen on the panel, which makes it slightly annoying. Coupled with the dark screen, it makes me feel like I'm losing my eyesight.The stickers that they provide aren't very helpful either. They stick so close to the screen that both sides of my filter have been split into the two plys because it was so close to the screen, when I tried to put it in, it split the layers. Required quite a bit of effort to get it to fit perfectly and yet still allow the filter to be easily removable.For this price, I'm sure there are better options."
1,did not work,Other then tint the screen it did not work. You are still able to see the screen from almost every angle.
4,"Great for MacBook Pro 13.3""","This screen fits perfectly on my MacBook Pro 13.3"". I actually measured my screen and it seems that this particular screen fits so much better than the one made for a 13.3"" screen. Go figure.The only thing keeping this review from 5-stars, is because the way you're supposed to attach it to your laptop is a little funny. The side holders work great, but the bottom holders keep peeling off. I actually ended up using the 2 side holders and a piece of clear scotch tape at the bottom. This doesn't particularly bother me, but some people may not like this homemade feature.The privacy screen itself works great! Definitely keeps wondering eyes off your business. Overall, excellent product."
4,"Great filter, but adhesive tabs missing","The screen is great, offering excellent protection from pryingplane travellers etc.The only downside was that the double sided sticky tabs that allow you to mount it directly to the display were not in the package, just the ones that allow it to be (relatively) easily removed. I prefer the others."
3,Pricey privacy filter,"This is very pricey for what you get... Also, if someone is standing up behind you (while you're sitting and facing your laptop), they can still clearly see what's on the screen. However, it works well for folks to the left and right of you (like in a plane)."
3,decent for the price,"I'd been looking for a privacy filter but everything I found was almost $200 for the same type of product. This isn't 100% effective (due to the angle of my desk), but it serves its purpose for where my desk is situated, plus you can't beat the price."
1,I don't like this product,It works slightly when someone is next to you but not completely. I m not crazy about it. I may return it.
1,Bad design - do not buy!,"The privacy filter works exactly as described and would be a fantastic product is not for the poor way that it attaches to the laptop screen. Basically, you have cheap plastic tabs that are stuck to the outside of the screen. There are a few problems with this:1. the tabs are ugly and the adhesive does not disappear. So it makes it look cheap2. the tabs block part of the view of the edges of the screenmost importantly:3. the tabs DO NOT HOLD THE FILTER FLUSH TO THE SCREEN. Because of this gap between the filter and the screen, the light scatters, the resolution of your screen looks terrible, and there are lots of distortions.I am disappointed that 3M, who has invented some of the world's most advanced adhesives, could not make a glare/privacy filter that adheres to the screen, rather than one that is held in by cheap plastic tabs."
2,Tacky tabs hold the privacy filter,"While the privacy screen works, the stick on tabs that hold it in place are really tacky. I am embarrassed by the look.I should have been advised the ASUS laptop was not capable of holding the screen without the stick ons."
4,Good option,"This is the second 3M filter I've purchased. I have found that it is a good option for privacy. It fits my new Inspiron perfectly. Yes, these filters can accumulate dust between the screen and filter, but it isn't much trouble/maintenance to just pull the filter now and then to clean.It does a good job of reducing the viewing angle without dimming the sides of the screen too much."
5,must have product,This is a must have product for a consultant. It is useful in everywhere - open offices - planes etc. The only problem with the product is the price - it it too much.
3,Entire product?,Recieved the screen cover but none of the clips to secure it to the computer! I instead now have to tape it to my computer. It would have been nice to actually recieve everything to use the product
1,Way below expectation...,"I bought this to reduce the glare when using the laptop in the car. It doesn't reduce the glare when inside the house, much less in the car. In fact, it darkens the screen to where you can hardly find the mouse pointer.I didn't need the privacy screen since most all laptops have a reduced viewing angle anyway.I consider this a complete and total waste of a lot of money."
2,Not good privacy functions,I purchased this screen with the intention to avoid everyone whop was passing by to be able to see what I am working on. Instead you can pretty much easily see everything. It;'s like not having the screen at all. Even from far away.Very disappointing with the product. Money not well spent.
5,3M Privacy Filter,It works absolutely great! Monitor privacy could not be any better! It is worth every penny spent. I highly recommend it for anyone that needs office privacy in an open cubicle area.
4,3M Privacy Laptop Screen,This is a very effective product. The viewing angle is quite small so confidential screens are protected from inquisitive coworkers.
3,Great product but too expensive,The plastic adhesive strips used to hold the filter keeps giving way.3M needs to further improve on the design of the adhesive strips.
4,Works and doesn't interfere with frame/buttons on monitor,This fit the screen perfectly and doesn't block off any part of the monitor frame or access to any of the buttons.
3,Not impressed.,"Privacy part works well but with the filter on, it causes lines and letters on screen to have some shadow."
3,Cool to have it....,"I like it because people on the bus do not pick on my stuff... kind of annoying. But the way it holds on your screen is not the best, and a little bit messy. Some time it come off. But still like it...."
4,Doesn't fit quite right,"I got this for my EEE PC 1015pe. Based on what the measurements of my 10.1 screen were, this should have fit properly. However, I have a small gap at the top and bottom of the screen, maybe 1cm on both sides. While you can't see the what the tabs are, you can see that I have tabs open, in a web browser.The other issue, the model number (3M GPF10.1W) is stamped in to the screen, and does break up the text under it. I found it a little distracting.Even though it's not a perfect fit, I was impressed with the first use. No one noticed it at first. My class mates were impressed by it, and a few of them did find out where they'd have to be standing or sitting to be able to read the screen over my shoulder. Over all, it's nice, if it didn't have the Model number stamped in it, I would have given 5 stars, even with the gaps."
3,I found it hard to read the screen in low light,"The item is not for a 14.1 widescreen, I have a Dell 6420 and it has a 14.1W screen but the item didnt fit.on the plus side.. the point was to stop people next to me looking at my screen, which is does well..well... for parts of the screen is covers."
5,Works great,The screen works great as expected. Just watch out so you dont scratch it. It can scratch pretty easily if you lay it around.
5,Easy Installation,"It fit my screen perfectly. I love the fact that you can choose a glossy side or a matte side. The picture instructions were somewhat easy to follow (it was a bit difficult to comprehend the typed instructions as they were listed in many different languages along with English - that was overwhelming).Although I like the screen for the privacy option, my boyfriend likes it since it blocks out the brightness of the screen glaring in his face when I'm next to him. Another plus for getting this, I guess.The filter is easy to remove and there is a concave area at the top of the filter that allows easy removal."
4,Good for privacy,hard for others to look into your screens. Good for hiding those who has bad habit of popping into someone screens
3,Works but not as good as I had hoped.,Works but not as good as I had hoped because someone sitting in a seat net to me could still see a dim view of the pictures that I was looking at. Might be best to help make it difficult for others to read text from the side.
3,Does What It Advertises,"This does what it claims. However, it does warp over time and occasionally is troublesome to Luton or take off."
4,Privacy Filter Review,The product certainly is effective in keeping others from seeing what you are working on in your computer. It is difficult to determine the difference in the two sides however. I do like how handy it is to slip into place once the holders have been put onto the monitor.
4,Could Be Better,Doesn't sharpen screen image as much as advertised. Hardware to attach it to screen is weak. Gold looks to be on one side and no instructions or indicator which side of filter is to be out and the other side on the laptop screen.
4,it does the job,"the filter helps protect the data that is on my screen from view by other people, especially since I have patient information on my computer. The only issue is the installation, it is not as easy as described."
4,One minor complaint keeps it from 5 stars!,"I just got this for work, because I travel quite a bit and work on confidential material. After a friend had the experience of someone being really nosy about her work, I decided I needed to take the precaution to avoid having a snoop cause me any trouble.Installation is very easy...I used the two long tabs, one in either corner, and it seems to be working out perfectly.Looking at what it blocks out, it does a great job at preventing airplane seat-mates from seeing what I'm working on. The one thing it won't prevent is someone standing behind you--they'll still be able to see what you're working on.I took off one star for something you might think is absurd, but it's distracting! The top of the filter has some numbers/letters etched into it, and it ends up looking like a smudge on the top of my screen. It keeps drawing my attention there, which just seems so unnecessary!"
4,3M Privacy Filter,"Received product on time and in good condition. The filter performs as advertised. There is, however, one characteristic which causes a visual distraction when the filter is in place on the notebook computer. The filter has a curved cut-out along the top edge, about one inch long and one-quarter inch deep. I assume it is to facilitate removal of the filter, albeit totally unnecessary. The 'distraction' occurs because of the brightness of the screen behind the cut-out, whereas the remainder of the screen is darkened slightly by the filter even when directly in front of it.The filter does NOT come with a protective envelope for when it is not mounted on the notebook. I made one out of a larger heavy-weight envelope, cut to the appropriate size. It will keep the filter from getting scratched when stored in the notebook case.Good product, marred only by the unnecessary cut-out along the top edge."
1,Moire effect on MacBook Air 11.6,"The 3M Gold display privacy filter seems to be *not* compatible with the 11.6"" Air display, creating a serious moire pattern (something in the display is 90 degrees different from other displays as the filter looks great when turned 90 degrees but of course it is useless that way)."
4,"Does the job, could be better","The screen does everything it proclaims to. I can see straight on and once you get about 40 degrees off everything is dark. Good for an office or cafe but for a tight fitting airplane the guys next to you will still be abel to make some things out.Of course, it does darken your screen brightness a bit but they all do this.My one criticism is the attachment method. The sticky tabs provide cut into the screen so you see a tab or two per screen side. It's a visual distraction and could easily be designed out.The PF13.3W Widescreen Notebook is the one that fits the MacBook Air (1st gen) and the computer closes just fine."
5,Awesome,"I bought this so that other students could not watch everything I was doing in class. It works perfect, some students have asked me if my laptop was even on!"
2,OK,"This privacy filter is great for an airplane like 3M advertises, but when I'm at home and my laptop is on my desk the person standing behind me can see the screen just as well as I can. I think it is a bit pricy too. If this piece of plastic was around 15 dollars, I'd suggest buying it."
2,Not for MacBook Pro unibody models,"The tabs are meant for use with a laptop screen that has a bezel of some sort around it. The unibody MacBook Pro has no such thing, being completely flat with its border, so the tabs don't work. The privacy offered by the screen is adequate, but I'm holding it on my MacBook Pro with 3M Scotch tape!"
4,Gets lots of looks,"I got this for my Lenovo x200. I had to trim it slightly to fit the screen but it didn't hurt it to trim it with standard scissors. The tabs are a little hokey looking but I haven't found an alternative. I have people approach me all the time and say, ""what an unusual screen"". It gets a lot more attention than the standard black privacy screens."
3,"Very Good, Once you get it hooked up","I had a Fellowees privacy filter on my old laptop but had to change to 3M when i bought the new 15.6 Inch laptop, The problem with the product is the way it is attached to the screen, ,my laptop has a flat screen and this attaching the holding parts of the product to the screen proved to be a real mess. Once i was able to hold it together on the screen, the privacy filter works excellently.Update:After using this product for a week or two, the plastic parts attached to the screen starting falling off and it is causing me a nightmare to keep using this product. If you have a flat LCD like those on the new HPs then this product is going to be problematic for you, other than if your screen has a frame then by all means go ahead and buy the product."
2,Visible lines made me dizzy,"For three years I've used the smoke colored 3M privacy filter on a 15"" macbook pro, and it's been awesome. Just bought a 17"" and saw this new gold filter and had to give it a go (it's really cool looking :-).But, big bummer when I put it on the screen - unlike the smoke colored one, this gold one has visible diagonal lines that made me dizzy within a minute of viewing. Sending it back to get the smoke filter."
5,There is no equal.,"The 3M Privacy filter is something everyone who works on things that are better not seen by others around you. Are you tired of getting people walking up to you and asking ""What is that you are working on?"" Or ""Hey, I saw that video."" Or, ""Should you be working on that at work?""Well, then this filter basically filters them out. It stops people who are not directly in front of the screen from seeing it. Funny... A few years ago everyone was trying to make screens that had a wider viewing area... Anyway, if you move to one side or the other, the screen looks black.I've tried other brands including the Viewguard, and the 3M is a lot better.Be sure to buy the correct size for your screen. You do not want to have to cut them down yourself."
4,Not bad ...,"I've been using this filter on my laptop for a day now, and I'm generally pleased. It fits perfectly, it attaches very well, it cuts glare and it is generally unobtrusive. My minor nitpicks are that for a large laptop monitor the filter can be a bit of a hindrance. I find myself moving my head in order to get a better angle for looking at something on the edges of the screen. Also as far as privacy goes, if someone is sitting shoulder to shoulder with you he is still able to see what program is on the screen (MS Excel is easy to spot), but the data is obscured. It's not a ""blank"" screen to an onlooker until he is a bit farther away.All in all it's a good item if you can pick it up on sale."
2,It serves it purpose but eyes hurt,"What made me decide to purchase this was it provides a filter for my screen and at the same time reduces the glare I get from the monitor. I was excited to use, being 3M is trusted brand, you know the quality of their product is worth your money.The item came well packaged as you would expect from 3M. The filter came in a plastic & in perfect shape and it came with the little stickies to hold the filter in place. it fit all perfectly.The only thing I don't like is that the filter for some reason causes an eye strain. I feel like my vision got a bit blurry from staring at the monitor for few minutes. I had to increase the brightness of my laptop's monitor since it is dynamic, it automatically adjusts to my environment's lighting and increased the font size.It serves it purpose but I don't know if I need to get used to it first or what. I have perfect vision and this definitely affects it."
3,"Anti-snooping, not anti-glare","Some anti-snooping screens also prevent glare, but not this one. In fact, it has a high-glare surface that makes it almost useless in many indoor environments where you can't adjust the lighting. The privacy feature works well, but the glare makes the screen unusable in many environments."
3,Its OK,"The 3M Gold Privacy Filter does it's job ... maybe too well. I find that the privacy screen is too dark even when looking directly into it. I have increased my screen brightness and still it is dark.. I find that I take it off rather than work with it, unless there is a specific reason to have it installed like in the airport. I intended to always have it in place but that is not the case. This means that the screen is beginning to get scratched. A friend had the lesser model (dark but not gold). I should've gotten that."
1,Abismal,"The product does not affix to the screen. As far as opaquing the view of people beside you, it is minimal at best."
1,lacks privacy,the product is not that good. only blocks views from the extreme sides.I wish i could return it. it's really not worth the price
3,Doesn't Fit,The screen is awesome however the fit for my new Samsung 9 Series was not a match. It was off by a quarter of an inch. I was expecting better from both Amazon as well as 3M.
1,Wrong Item,"The item you sent me was the wrong item wrong size wrong colorand did not serve the purpose, I don't think I'm ordering anything else"
2,Takes a while to get used to.,"The screen is a little shiny. It hurt my eyes for the first few days. I expected to have complete privacy from outside viewing but no such luck. You can't see a thing if you stand to the side of the screen. But anything from behind, even at a distance is clear to the eye. SO much to pay for not enough privacy!"
4,Save the trees,"The product works great, but the only problem I have with this purchace was the company I bought it through. They charged me $6 or so for shipping. The envelope that the screen comes in was sufficient to slap on some postage and put it in the mail. But, the company was so wasteful it had to put in about 10 yards of filler paper & place it in a 3 x 2 foot box! They not only killed a few trees, but also wasted my money on shipping."
3,"The product seems to be great,..","It seems to be a a great product, but it was not specified if it is widescreen or not and I bought a wrong size and since I live in another country it would be very expensive to change the product. I still think that the product has a very high price. It would be a little less expensive."
1,NOT for current generation Macbook Air!!,"I bought this for use with my new 13.3"" Macbook Air. I used one of the gold films on my Lenovo tablet and it worked great, so I figured I'd try one for my Air. Big mistake.When placed on the screen, it creates dark likes all over the screen and distorts text. It renders the display unreadable and gives you a headache after a few minutes. I've written 3M about this issue as I find it totally ridiculous that a privacy filter doesn't work with the most portable notebook out there, the Macbook Air.Here's hoping 3M has some sort of solution up it's sleeve. I'm not sure if there are even any other options and that's a shame."
4,Best read using the Index,"One other review said the book was awful and boring, like a textbook. That's a decent observation, the book IS textbookish, and that can be a burden. I think the way to read it is to look up people in the Index whom you are interested in, and then go read those parts, separate little excursions into the pages. The book is a bit like an encyclopedia, maybe it could have been better edited. I noticed repeated sentences only a page apart. But I like the book, and what Green has to say about Waugh, the Sitwells, the effect of the First War on the minds of young aristocrats, is an education. Buy it and enjoy it, but don't read it cover to cover like other books, it doesn't work so well that way. I've referred to it many times as I've read about ballet history, for instance, or the backstory of Brideshead Revisited. A good book, you can get a lot out of it."
2,Tedious and Pretentious,"This man, rather than truly informing us, prefers to try to impress us with how much more learned and knowledgeable he is than we are. He leads us down totally irrelevant alleys (mostly to drop names), and the whole thing is in no way coherent, so that we don't get a real sense of how everything goes together - just the confusion that the British are so fond of promulgating. Who the HELL was his editor?I'm fairly well read, but I think his audience is a crowd of Oxford University English Lit PhD candidates."
3,Awful !,"I wish that I could say something good about this book, but regretfully, the only thing that I can comment on is that after 30 pages, I decided that it was like reading an English Textbook that was going no where ! I tried to appreciate the authors enthusiasm for English literature, unfortunately, it was lost on me. I hope that you enjoy the book more than I did. As far as I am concerned, it was a total loss. Sorry that this review could not be more positive and up beat. Please let me know if you get more out of it, and I will attempt again to get through the heavy English style. I wish that I could provide provide further favorable comments, but, there just wasn't anything there. Good Luck and Best Wishes !"
2,Children of the Sun,"This is an academic type book trying not to be academic. It is pretentious and cloying and a bore. I (a.) wish I hadn't purchased it, (b.) I'll never finish reading it and (c.) I can't think of anyone who would want it."
1,Not a great one,Not a great book for science fair projects. A bunch of incoherent babbling and not something kid friendly. My dtr is a straight A 5th grader and this book was not helpful at all. A total flop
3,Not as useful as I'd hoped,The book is fair. Many of the ideas area already over-used. It did not provide as much information as I had hoped.
4,ballad of...,"An amazing record, and in my opinion this band was the best thing any former member of Hoover went on to do. The guitar playing is incredible, drenched in reverb and stinging feedback. In fact the shrill notes of feedback echoing in between chords almost serve to enhance the songs, giving them a ghostly quality. This record can get downright heavy, but it also shows a softer side that would later be explored more in depth with Abilene. Vocals go from a murmer to a roar, and the bass playing and drums are far more punchy than those found on a Hoover record, which definitely gives Regulator Watts a different feel from that previous band, as well as Crownhate Ruin (which features Fred and Joe from Hoover). Unfortunately these records are getting harder and harder to find, but they are well worth looking for..."
5,very sharp knives,"I bought this set of knives after returned a disappointing santoku knife I got from Target. This one is so much better, has excellent weight, feel very balanced in hand. Most importantly, it's sharp! Even the small knife comes with it is well-bulit, too. I'm very happy with it. I'd give it 4 stars for performance, then there's price so it deserves a 5!"
1,Hard to rate,"This item was ordered 1/4/06 it is now 2/25/06 and has not yet been shipped. Hard to rate the item, but for sure you can see the rating for delivery."
3,"""Top Trails"" book is better","I purchased this book as well as Top Trails' ""Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park"" by Andrew Dean Nystrom, and was disappointed with ""Family Guide"" as compared with ""Top Trails"". As I am using these books to plan a family vacation, I am especially interested in finding child-friendly hikes. The ""Top Trails"" book provides a good summary of the hikes (mileage, difficulty, terrain, and activities) at the beginning of the book, an overview missing from ""Family Guide""."
5,Excellent advice for family vacation planners,"We used this book on a family vacation to the Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. The books have excellent advice for parents of young children. The suggested hikes come with reasonably accurate information to help in choosing easy, moderate or difficult hikes. For a couple of the hikes, I found it a little hard to find the starting points. However, overall, this was an invaluable aide in making the most of our visit to Yellowstone, which can be somewhat overwhelming due to its sheer size."
3,Messy as all get out...,Well the mats look good but i dont know what its made of but the material falls off and gets all over the floor board. Id go rubber if i were you... if you could find them.
5,still not Nietzsche's best,"I usually tell people to read this book first if they have not read any Nietzsche, followed by Genealogy and Zarathustra. Nietzsche's overall project in this book is extremely significant, and especially toward the beginning of the book he seems to be at his best. But as Kaufmann notes in his intro., the book contains many embarassing passages such as the section on women (it's not embarassing b/c of its subject matter - I love to hear Nietzsche tell it how it is about women - it's just that the aphorisms aren't good except for perhaps, ""A black dress and a silent part make a woman appear smart."")and the poem at the end. Besides this there are many weak sections, and Nietzsche really accomplishes his task after the first few sections. Nevertheless, this work is essential for understanding Nietzsche's thought, and while not the best stylistically, it remains one of the most important."
2,Get ready to vomit,"I can't read this. I did read this. This is what it turned me into. I'm paralyzed, anxious, depressed. I don't know what to do."
3,Free will????,"If you really believe (like some reviewers have professed to) that Nietzche could dispose of the millenium-old argument of free-will vs determinism with a couple of paragraphs comparing weak wills to strong wills, you need to re-learn the basics of the scientific method...Also, if you are relying on Nietzche's own ""courageous"" behavior, squirming from country after country in Europe in search of relief from his ""physical"" illnesses, to support such ""weak will"" vs ""strong will"" theories, look again..."
4,An interesting translation,"I had been wanting to read into some of Neitzsche's ideas and wasn't sure which book to pickup until I found this one. The translation is very good, but a bit hard to understand at times. I had to read some sentences over and over to fully understand them, but that is expected with someone like Neitzsche, especially in a translation. The translation was beautifully written, and presented Neitzsche's thoughts and ideas very well.If you are looking into Neitzsche for the first time I highly recommend this book. Mainly because it offers a very broad summary of his ideas for the newcomer. After reading this I would suggest moving onto his more specific works. Regardless, this was a great thought-provoking read."
2,Vastly overrated,"Nietzsche, along with Derrida and Foucault must be amongst the most overrated of all philosophers. They represent the polemics of the literary mindset against the epistemic/logical concerns that ought to be the concern of philosophy.Forget Nietzsche. If you seek logic, read Frege, Wittgenstein and Russell. A chapter each of Hume, Kant and Hegel have more substance than the entire Nietzschean corpus. If it is practical philosophy that is your concern, you would do well to read the Stoics, Cicero, Seneca and Boethius. Sceptical considerations are well accounted for, by Sextus Empiricus and the Pyrrhonean school.OTOH, if mindless and intemperate polemics is all that you seek, by all means read Nietzsche. That is all that he is capable of."
3,Zarthustra beats the hell outta this,"I remember trying to read Beyond Good and Evil.....WHAT THE HELL IS THIS NUT TRYING TO SAY??????!!!!!!!?????Then, I picked up the work which I was introduced to Nietzsche, the one I wanted to read first and the one I should've read first.I don't know why but I follow philosophy easier when it is presented through fiction, a philosophical tale in a style reminiscent of Voltaire.That's what I found in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, obviously not in this ""mess."""
5,you have to read it to believe it,"This book is absolutely incredible. A book of philosophy that is also a real page-turner. This a great book to read for those (like me) who are not accustomed to reading philosophy and therefore is not familiar with jargons of philosophy. Nietzsche writes in an engaging, sharp and acessible manner without dumbing down any of his challenging ideas.Everyone should read this book, regardless of whether they agree with Nietzsche's views or not. His writing is truly thought-provoking without resorting to weak shock tactics."
4,At times I wish I were with these four men,"I am amazed at how the human spirit can accomplish such as feat when most of us don't even allow such an event to be an original thought across our minds. At times I wished I were with these four men (and cat) to live the four month adventure. Truly, God must have been on their side to allow these men to reach Australia from Ecuador via a small hunk of wood in such a vast ocean. I found this book by accident in my public library while searcing for Amazon River information. See what neat stuff you can find by serendipity in your public library!"
4,One of my favorite childhood reads,"This is the extraordinary account of a fascinating adventure. Four guys made a platform using balsa wood tree trunks, put a very rudimentary cabin atop the trunks, and crossed the Pacific Ocean departing from South America. They had a radio on board, plus some basic supplies, and for 4 months or so were happy sailors. I read this book as a kid, in its original Spanish (Vital Alsar is from Spain), and was fascinated by the story. Once i finished the book, i started reading it again. The photos were great! I vividly remember a photo of their ""toilet"" (they converted a wooden barrel, and stuck it on the side of the raft). Now that I am an adult, I would love to re-read it, because as a kid I don't think I realized the enormous guts and ingenuity that it took for them to do this.In summary, if you find this book somewhere, grab it!"
5,be thankful fo' tha eastsidaz,All I have to say is this cd is the s**t. From the beginning to the mu'fuccin' end. What ya'll know about the blue golf hats cuz.HCG DGPC RTC ICG
4,definitely G'd up!!!,"Yeah the west coast kinda went down after 2pacs death and the Deathrow Drama. SnoopDogg along with his homeys Tray Dee and Goldie Locc form ""Tha Eastsidaz"" to prove that gangsta rap is comin' back. Yeah this album is tight but does not match the classic ""Doggystyle"" nor ""The Chronic"". Still, its one hot joint check it out if youre a Snoop fan."
4,nice work,"Nice work, but it doesn't top the West Coast rap of the old days. It seems like a copy of some of it, which is a compliment. If you can't beat 'em, copy 'em! Apparently Snoop learned a lot from 2Pac."
1,As bad as they come...,"This album was pure garbage. I don't appreciate anything Snoop Dogg is doing for hip-hop and he's got to stop until he does something good. This whole Eastsidaz thing doesn't make any sense...plus, since when was Snoop ever into this whole ""east coast/west coast"" battle? He represents Long beach, and he's mentioned it a few times, but never has he bragged about it so much. His attitude has just changed. He thinks he's the ish and he's not...at least not anymore. Not even Warren G or Suga Free could make this album barely decent. This is just wiggity wiggity wack!"
2,Not one of his best!,"I thought this was like his old stuff. F that it is Fing S**t. It is a complete waste of money, anyone wanna buy it from me?"
1,VERY WEAK ALBUM BY SNOOP.,This album was horrible and all the beats were boring.No songs really stand out and this is the point were he really starts to sell out.DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!!
5,Snoop represents,"as usual snoop and other dpgs, represent on this album, unlike other ones this album has a real good feel to it, definitly worth buying. if you love snoop or not, you'll miss out if you dont get it"
4,D.P.G.C. IS IN DA HOUSE DA DOGGHOUSE,"Snoop has done it again starting his label off in da tru g-funk fashion wit dat L.B.C. flava West Coast east side is definately on da scene,the cd is tight the only thing I would have liked to see is DAZ AND DRE on the cd repin dat DPGC,otherwise tight as can be get it."
4,Long Beach representin' EASTSIDE!,"Big Snoop Dogg has done it again...I really like this ablum cuz it's going back to the G-funk sounds that them Long Beach cats originated...Coming from Long Beach, I dig this album cuz it just represents LBC to the fullest. It's tight but you wouldn't rank up there with Kurupt's The Street is a Mutha or Dre's Chronic 2001. But it has some phat beats that keep yo head noddin...""If you got beef with D.P.G holla at me the D.O.G"""
3,Snoop's record label's first act is nothing special,"Since Doggystyle, Snoop hasn't done much worth mentioning. This is no exception, and is actually even worse since neither Tray Dee nor Goldie Loc are anything special on the mic. The production is actually good on this album, but, with so many other albums, the tracks progressively get worse, and towards the last quarter of the album, I am sick of the artist(s). Tray Dee and Goldie Loc don't bring anything new to the table, which doesn't help. They are simply two average rappers with average mic skills. Snoop Dogg is the one who carries this album, but not even he can save it from falling into the reoccuring category: average rap albums. His second effort with the Eastsidaz wasn't much better, and thankfully they have now left Snoop's lable. Snoop should keep up the solo work because his past 3 albums (starting with Top Dogg) haven't been half bad."
4,Tha Eastside,"This album is not Snoop's best work. This album is better than his first NO LIMIT release but pales compared to his first CD, which most CDs do. I am glad to see Snoop still working on albums."
1,the same old formula,Snoop once couldn't wait to leave Death Row.well call it Ironic of how Death Row sounding this disc is.it seems like outtakes more than a new original Album.Snoop has fallen off but i'll always give him props cuz he has talent but doesn't always get the best material.he didn't need to present anyone on this set.he could have done this disc in his sleep.nothing special at all.i hope he gets with Dre&Quik again.
3,Its Getting There,"yo, snoops tryin real hard. this is better than all his no limit stuff, and the weak doggstyle. Top dog has some banging beats, but the 20 songs is not necessary. A good 12, and it would be a classic. But anyway, get this one, and his next. After that one, he'll be onpoint again like the old days."
3,Getting Warmer,"After two successful yet dissapointing releases under Master P's No limit records, snoop dogg, a.k.a. top dogg, a.k.a. Big Dogg, ventures back to LBC and hooks up with his West Coast Eastsidaz, Tre Dee and Goldie Loc. These tracks are a lot better than those that no limit produced. They have more of the Doggystyle flavor. Those who like his old stuff and likes straight out gangsta rap will enjoy this cd."
3,Not as I expected,"Ok , the cd is tight , there are some good songs and it's an old school style like "" we can take it back to 85 "" but I expected more , it's not like Snoop's "" no limit top dogg "" or Dre's "" 2001 "" if you are a fan of the D.O.G check it !"
2,Weak,"This album is weak. The production is poor and Snoop Dogg is at his worse. I don't know what this album is meant to be about or what it was made for. There are a couple of tracks, numbers 5 and 14, that are pretty good but most are weak because of lame production, but mostly because Snoop and co are struggling to come up with things to rap about. As a result Snoop is reduced to talking about his wife and kids, not very gangsta or interesting, Tray Deee obsessed with how saggy his kackeees are, and they all remmanis about when they lived in the hood in 1985, which is hardly relevant in 2001. This album seems to have been made simply for the sake of making and album. Low budget and uninspired. Don't buy this album, but do buy the new Eastsidaz album, Duces and Trayz. It is better than this in every way."
1,Just not a good CD,"I liked old school Snoop like The Chronic and Doggystyle, but this just isn't good. For those that are wondering the East in Eastsidaz is the ""east side of Long Beach"" in California.. not the east coast and is like a little crew that Snoop started to back him up on the mic. Problem is the two he chose are not very talented at all. The beats sound very thrown together and rushed. Frankly if you want the biggest rapper on the west coast rapping with a back up group go with 2Pac + the Outlawz ""Still I Rise"" CD.. it's 10 times better than this CD... literally."
5,EaStSiDaZ,"Pretty cool album from Snoop's group Tha Eastsidaz this is a classic just like snoop by himself, cool beats, must have"
5,Four Days In A Motel Room,"This CD is a combination of the first Nuns CD and the fourth. Geza X produced this CD and Josie Cotton of ""Johnny Are You Queer"" fame did some vocals on the cult ""Do You Want Me On My Knees""...Another college radio fave is ""Platinum Princess"" a fast, raunchy punk rock tune that defines punk sluttery!!!Although some of these songs were recorded on a very low budget, there are some real trashy gems on this CD.Hidden in the very last tracks, we have ""Sex Dream"" which was recorded at the famous Tarpan Studios, home of many platinum hits. ""Sex Dream"" was another Live 105 semi hit and this excellent recording hints of what was to come..."
1,Great idea - poor product,"I was delighted to find these wide boot blousers on Amazon. I heard great things about them in the past and was inspired to try them out. I ordered 2 sets of blousers. Unfortunately they were not at all what I expected. Although they provide excellent ""blousing"" quality, they are not long enough, were very uncomfortable to wear and cut off my blood circulation more than anything, even at the widest setting. I am a female and don't have large calves/legs, which is why I was particularly surprised that these blousers had such a ""snug"" fit. Although they are made from elastic material, they barley stretch. I was disappointed with this product and have since then returned to the ""old school"" boot blousers.Great concept, just not ""perfected"" yet."
5,A must have for a true hunter's collection,"It's a great read, and it can truly be said ""They don't make 'em like that any more."" Col. Jim Corbett was as well mannered as he was tough. This collection of stories is as well written as the hunter was honorable to his prey and sport. The only thing you may find a bit unpleasant about the book is the end, you won't want it to."
4,Typical Corbett,"This is typical of Jim Corbett's other works about hunting man-eaters. There's enough suspense to suit anyone. It is told with a matter of fact approach, nothing sensational but still exciting. It's easy to read and unfamiliar names are usually explained, though it seems a bit choppy and hampered by over-use of commas. Detail is sparse. Avid shooters might want a bit more commentary on the weapons employed since these antiques are presumably unfamiliar to most modern hunters."
4,Panasonic ES2218VC ladies shaver,Really like this shaver. The pivoting head is a great feature. Good for sensitive skin as there is no razor burn. Would recommend this shaver.
3,ok,"works, does not improve reception just enables you to locate router under a desk and have antenna above"
2,So-so Antenna,Useful at getting signal from bedroom to livingroom. I doubt that you would get much range out of it otherwise: no change of signal on patio.
4,Works as advertised,"The antenna does what it is supposed to do. I was able to separate the antenna from the rest of the equipment in my network closet and get a better signal. As other users have stated, it would be really nice if the cable was longer, say about 6-7 feet. I took one * off just because the antenna was not as long as I would like it to be."
2,It's just another antenna!,"Leads too short to move the antenna into a better position nearby the router.Signal strength was about the same if not slightly less.This product did not work for me.If you have the router or card under a desk and need to have an antenna above the desk, then this is the answer."
3,just my comments on mounting,"works ok did not see any change in signal strength but it did get my router off of my deskcable was a lot shorter than i would have liked, the mount leaves a lot to be desired kind of ugly hanging on the wall a shame the base was not removable, it would have also been nice if it came in white like my dir 655 did"
4,Makes a difference,"If your PC is hidden under your desk, this antenna will make a significant difference in the signal level. It is well worth the money."
4,Good,"When it comes to wireless set ups, I'm pretty sure i have the worst set up of all time. My router is located across my entire house and is one level higher. I got a d-link desktop wireless adapter for it not too long ago and the stubby antennas that came with that don't even try to pick up a signal. I decided to invest in an antenna to maybe improve my connection. I received the unit shortly after I ordered it, unpacked it, plugged it in and it worked! Make sure to note that you need an adapter for this antenna to work. It wont plug into any existing plugs on the back of your regular old PC. That being said, it doesn't work very well. I can connect with about 3 bars of wifi, but I suffer from dropped connections all the time. It is slow a lot and takes restarting and resetting to get anything to work properly. But I think that is just my crappy set up I have. The antenna works fine, I just have to get some better wireless equipment."
1,Total Waste,"I consider this a total waste of money and space. I get stronger signals with the built in-antennas on the D-Link Xtreme Gigabit router than with this external antenna attached. I spent several hours trying every location and antenna angle I could, and no arrangement provided as good a signal as the built-in antennas. I packed it back up and threw it in the bottom of my closet."
5,Easy to set up and use,"Great product. I added this to the router I got to reposition and extend the range. I can ""see"" the SSID from places I could not before. Great buy."
3,Good only if router is hidden!!!!!!!!,"My hope was that this would increase my signal strength from my already exposed router. But with the short cable, I showed no increased in ""bar strength"" at my extreme locations no matter how I positioned the antenna legs.Use this only if your router signal needs exposure. Otherwise to lengthen the signal, get an extender."
4,It works!,"My router is in the second story of my house and I wanted better reception and throughput for my computers on the first level of the house and for my TIVO in the family room. I looked at lots of solutions and this one seemed like a good place to start-- not too expensive. I had modest expectations.Altogether, the antenna and a little router ""tweaking"" gave me about a 20%-25% improvement in reception and speed. I'm particularly happy with TIVO throughput since I can now watch YouTube videos and download from Amazon without a problem.While these may not seem to be amazing results, I'm not surprized. The improvements are mostly the result of being able to get the antennal up high and eliminate going through one wall. While I started out thinking this was not going to be my final solution, I've decided to stand pat with this solution for now."
5,Excellent Antenna,"Used this antenna on my sons computer which is facing away from the router, tucked into his desk at the other end of the house. Essentially the purpose for which the antenna was made. Went from very low signal to full strength. Worked great!"
2,"Might work for a desktop card, but not on a router","This is just a normal antenna...put it on my router (D-Link DIR-655) and it had no effect or was a lttle worse. I think it is best suited for a desktop card to get the antennas out from behind the computer to a better spot, that would probably result in an improvement...this is not a high gain antenna."
1,"Good Idea, but....","Easy to install, but noticed very little, if any difference. My specific situation wouldn't have been very difficult to remedy - if this product remotely worked as advertised, I'd be a happy camper. To boot - I'm an IT guy professionally and had totally realistic expectations."
2,Did not work for me,I have returned this product. It did not increase the range of my router at all. I have D-link dual band n router.
1,decrease range,d-link dir 655 doesnt rly increase range product actually made network strength lower in all cases throught the house not a great add on
2,Not Useful,"I don't like this product, the router works better with the original. I put in the box and in my storage for a garage sale."
3,Doesn't Boost the signal significantly as desired!,"I installed this antenna to increase signal/strength of a dlink express pci-e card, DWA-556. I had windows 7 home premium and then got windows 7 ultimate. The signal strength increased from the three antennas that came with the card and I can get internet access but not very good. The led from the card to the antenna is not as long it could be but the problem is windows 7 period (?) not the antenna."
3,Worked For My PC But Not On DIR 655,I have one of these for my desktop PC which helped get more bars. I thought I would pick one up for my DIR 655 as it sits low in a desk on the 2nd floor. I hooked up the 3 cables positioned the Antennas and went back downstairs to see if I saw an increase in signal strength. I did not.It worked well to move the antennas from the back of my PC but it didn't help my DIR 655 router 'shoot' out better signal.
4,Works Greats With Wireless Card,"I was a bit skeptical at first, but I got it anyways. I attached the antenna to my desktop's wireless card and my signal strength doubled, so needless to say I am a happy camper. Good product and works better than I had expected."
4,Helps if you need only to make your antenna more visible,"That was my case. My htpc stays on a shelf and the antenna on the bottom, away from the view of the router. So, this antenna extender was really useful to me, but it does not make miracles or amplify your signal and the product does not advertise that."
3,Not a big improvement,"I bought this antenna for D-link 655 extreme router. It supposed to improve transmission from second to first floor. Unfortunately I don't see any significant amendment. I use to have low or very low signal, now I got low. The cable is only 3', it could be longer."
3,Only good for a router a few feet away :(,"I can't move myD-Link DIR-655 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Routerbut was hoping to move the antenna to a different wall using this product. It was a non-starter: the cable is way too short, less than 4' long.Pro:+ Solidly built. High quality cable+ Includes mounting screws to mount in sheetrock+ Nice diagram of signal envelope for each antenna includedCon:- Aluminum mount is UGLY. Too ugly to mount on my wall without a beating from my wife.- The cort is SHORT - just under 4' long. If you were hoping to ceiling mount your antenna or move it, you can't.This is going back into its box and on a shelf. At least it was relatively cheap. I really, really wish they could have made the cable a more useful length (e.g. 10-15 feet), and that I could have found the cable length on the D-Link website."
5,Don't miss your chance to stop and smell the Spaceblooms!,"So frequently in life, we are encouraged to stop and smell the roses. In 2267, Awk Ro asks us to stop, smell and, indeed, taste the Spaceblooms - a unique collection of thirty-three cosmic flora of no natural garden variety. In this imaginary cosmic landscape, I found a wealth of beauty, humour and inspiration. These Spaceblooms are no ordinary flowers. And this is no ordinary book. Truly a testament to the limitless boundaries of the human imagination - Spacebloom is destined to become the blueprint for astronauts looking for floral life beyond Earth."
4,Yummy!,"The first two stories in this book are very good. The third story, was not bad but should have been a book by itself. It left out a lot of the story and made you feel like started the story somewhere in the middle. Overall it was a good book and I enjoyed reading it."
1,Beware of the colors,"I wish Amazon had noted the colors of this product as it did not look red and blue on my LCD screen. When it came I was disappointed. Also, the third party company they are selling this for was closed until April 28th so I have not been able to receive any customer service. This is my first time buying from Amazon and it has made me leery for the future."
1,Piece of Trash,"I bought this watch to help me train for a triathlon. A month after I bought it the button to start and stop the stop watch broke; it is now nothing more than a watch to me, and I paid for a watch/stopwatch that could track several different laps. I will never purchase another Nike product, considering my experience with a pair of Nike running shows essentially going flat on me after only a year (they had air cushoning and it ""popped"")."
5,WOW!! WOW!! WOW!!,"This book is powerful , revealing, informitive,but most of all scarry. It makes you think. It reveals things to you that hide under the disguise of ""Harmless fun"". I say WOW!"
5,Superb!,"This book was by far one of the best I have read yet on the occult. I am always interested to see just how the devil can manipulate people and how he deceives them, but even more how God can set these people free from that bondage."
3,It's alright,This book is alright. She looks a few loose ends. She leaves the reader wondering whatever happen to some things that she disclosed. It's wasn't as powerful as I thought it would be. I don't knock it. I you were led to it then get it. Just know that it's alright. Try reading The Witch that Switched by Irene Park.
2,Dated...,"This book is from an era (early 1980's) when Christians were very paranoid about the devil, thinking everything was a satanic conspiracy. Its' (thankfully) very hard to take this type of thinking seriously these days. To the balanced reader, this book reads more like a story about one disturbed young womans' struggles with severe mental illness..."
1,A call for a little honesty,"The Beautiful Side of Evil is a religious diatribe, totally slanted in its position and allowing no surcease for the author's numerous opponents. Put simply, it is hate propaganda of the very worse sort.Had I more space and a greater interest, I would take direct statements from this book and refute them point by point. Instead, I think I will rank it right up there with other books of the sort, books such as The Satan Seller by Mike Warnke (later complete disproved), Michelle Remembers (same) and all of the material published by Jack Chick Publishing."
3,A great mind.,"Johanna Michaelsen has much to say. She is a great intellectual in the spirit of other Christian writers such as Dave Hunt, Constance Cumby, Jack T. Chick, Tim LaHaye, John Todd, Edge and Mike Warnke. She is a mental dynamo. There is a brain twister on every page. I can speak of many recommendations. The words rattled inside my cavity and led me to a place of magnified cognition."
1,Entertaining but not real,"I read the book, the Beautiful Side of Evil. Very simplistic reading, which is fine. It was entertaining, but that's about it.There is not one single documented piece of evidence in this book. Michaelsen doesn't even give last names for most of those involved...even those she says are witnesses such as ""Dr. Carlos"". In addition, Michaelsen has been associated with known frauds such as Mike Warnke and Lauren Stratford and the sensationalists pre-trib dispensational writer Hal Lindsey. To add to that, Johanna claims her aunt Dixie had some sort of satanic super powers...even though it was admitted by Lulu Hurst later in a tell-all memoir, these were fairly simple parlour tricks."
5,FOR THOSE WHO KNOW THAT EVIL EXISTS... IT TRULY DOES...,EVERY CHRISTIAN BELIEVER IN CHRIST JESUS SHOULD & NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK. IT WILL OPEN YOUR EYES TO AN EVIL SPIRITUAL REALM THAT MOST PEOPLE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BUT THE EVIL ONES INVOLVED IN THAT WORLD. THIS PERSON ESCAPED THAT EVIL WORLD & LIVES TO TELL ABOUT IT...
1,book review,Poor The book just to long .....The message could have been put accross in 10 pages The author is just to descriptive on stuff which is meaningless
1,brainwashing people everywhere,"I couldn't finish this book, I bought it because my aunt said it changed her life, and because I am pagan and want to see what changed her life so much I decided to read it. In reality when I started reading it I realized that it only Scared her because it was written to scare people rather then give them the truth. The story is grusome in a negative way, the author if she actually experienced this was truly foolish while writing it but then after... as it is clear that she was into spirituality only for the flash and pomp and still continues on that route.The last 20 or so pages are tips on how to defeat the devil in your life.... interesting stuff. I actually was so disturbed by the darkness of the book that I had to get rid of it, and usually I like to keep religiously biased stuff just for the sake of objectivity."
3,interesting but lengthy,This writer is very adept at describing surroundings and different characters. I liked the story very much and yet I felt he left out key emotional responses to huge shifts in Lily's life. It is an interesting book and I was sad when it ended but I felt it would have been enhanced by more in-depth emotional descriptions.
4,An excellent choice.,"This book is a very interesting read, however some of the writing is non-stanard (inordinate amount of italics)"
4,My first dip into Timothy Findley: Thumbs Up,"I was charmed by this book. It's a great story with strong characters, interesting themes and an evocative setting of turn-of-the-century Toronto. But I agree with the reviewer who noted the nonstandard usages. The archaic, arcane punctuation was particularly distracting. Get thee a good copy editor!"
5,Fits like a glove,"If this was oj's he'd be done lol. Like all leather products, you have to let it mold first for it to fit properly. Fits my Glock 19 like its second skin."
1,to small,"Holster would not come close to snapping shut with a glock 23, made due however cut the leather below the snaps and just just it with out them."
4,Comfortable,"I bought this to conceal my Glock 19. If you follow the break in instructions, it will fit your pistol like a glove. The suede exterior is very comfortable and prevents slipping when you draw your pistol. I've found it to be most comfortable at about four o'clock.... comfortable enough to wear while driving. The only reason I don't give it a fifth star is because it is a bit difficult to re-holster your weapon due to no stiffener above the slide. That said, the only time your going to put your gun in and out repeatedly is when you're practicing at the range. The draw is quick enough with practice and it does cover the trigger, which is critical with a Glock.Recommended"
4,Perfect conceal,"As soon as I recieved the holster it seem a little snug fit for my glock 19, but as the day progressed the leather began to mold itself around the gun, making it easy to take in and out of the holster. The holster is perfect, it stays where you put it; unlike most leather holster that slides while concealed, making it hardier for you make use of advantages of conceal weapons carry.. All around great holster, I give it a 4 out of 5 stars."
5,galco glock 19 holster,this is a great holster for the price. very good quality. fits my glock 19 perfectly. it is my first leather holster and will be my only one till it falls apart...if that ever happens. i give it 5 stars
4,"Great little, inexpensive holster.","This is a pretty decent, inside the pant, leather holster for twenty bucks (or less).There are better IWB holsters that have better draw, comfort, and concealment, but they cost about three times as much.If you need something to quickly slip on for a quick trip, this is perfect. I modified mine to remove the thumb break since this will only be worn for a few minutes at best.It will go on easy and the clip will do ok with the draw, but it is nowhere near as solid as a good IWB pancake style (I like CompTac Minotaur's)If you need an all day concealed carry you should probably look elsewhere."
4,Satisfied,"It was a christmas gift for my mother, she loved it. Just one thing, I had to get extension bracket because the holes didnt line up. overall satisfied."
3,Uneven,"Someone (Belloc?) said only Catholics and atheists are willing to play their beliefs all the way out. All other spiritual postions are compromise. This amusing novella illustrates the point. The main characters, an ardent Catholic and a committed atheist, wish to engage in a duel to the death in defense of their beliefs. They are continually interrupted by a stream of characters representing all sorts of moral types. Although the subject is interesting, the narrative doesn't flow well: first you have pages of philosophical dialog, and then intervals of action and plot development of varying length. The result is great difficulty in keeping everything straight. Although the book contains the usual GK wit and wisdom, it is not as tightly composed as his better works.A word about this (Dover) edition: hard to read. The spacing between rows of type is very narrow and the margins are very wide."
2,Get a different edition,"Great book, but this edition is cheaply put together. Not so much as a publishing date. Just the bare bones book. Even has typos on the back cover."
3,Enjoy the book; edition is a bit tight,We enjoy much of this book: it has some beautiful insights. I bought this edition because it was the cheapest. Beware that the chapters and words are closely set together--it's just a compact print but does include the entire book.
3,"a sometimes thought-provoking, sometimes confused allegory","A fairly intriguing didactic novel on atheism versus christianity, with an end that seems to presciently anticipate the advent of totalitarianism. But the whole thing is kind of a tangle, and the story doesn't really go anywhere."
2,Worst layout of any book I have used,This book will not prepare you for the exam! I found that the book was horribly put together. It is very hard if not impossible to locate and study for all of the objectives covered on the test. I would suggest the Sybex book on the same subject. I read this book and did not feel at all prepared to take the test and found the Sybex four days before the test and had to speed read it. I have found the Sybex book to be a better resource for real life also.
3,not what i expected,"i was thinking jazz..it has it's own genre. the first song is awesome. i think i might have to listen to it more to get used to it. awesome musical talents though, i have a great appreciation for people who can play instruments."
5,Mechanix gloves Mg-05-009 black,These are the best gloves I use them for riding snowmobiles and working on cars. They are the best! My pair I had before this I wore every winter just about every weekend and they just now wore a hole in the finger.
4,Good all around hand protection,"Needed a new pair of gloves for working on cars and motorcycles, old ones had oil on them and a couple of rips. these gloves provide light-medium protection for most tasks, but will not protect will for welding or anywhere with intense heat."
4,Comfortable but not XXXL,"I have very large hands and I expected that at XXXL these would be plenty large enough for me.At XXXL they are not any larger than many XL/XXL gloves I have tried on elsewhere. Assuming you can squeeze your hand in, they are very comfortable to wear. I use them while doing wood work and quickly forget I am wearing them. They take forever to get on and off because of the ""small"" XXXL size, but are definitely worth it.Just a point: They look exactly like the picture. They have Mechanix written all over the outside of them."
4,"Decent glove, not fluid-proof","Well fitting, sharp-looking, good protecting glove. They gave me plenty of dexterity working on everything from small nuts to large particulate filters (even while hot). However, they are not oil/grease/fuel proof. I (stupidly perhaps) was wearing mine while working near diesel fuel. The fuel saturated the gloves and now they're effectively ruined. I'm going to buy another pair to replace my ruined ones, but in the future I'll make sure to switch over to nitrile gloves when working near fuel."
4,Great work gloves.,"Great work gloves, though like wearing any other gloves it's fairly difficult to manipulate small items (1/4"" nuts, short screws, etc.). In class, we were working on electric motors and the motor we had ran HOT! I was able to hold onto the motor with barely any heat transfer and wouldn't have been able to hold onto it without the gloves."
2,Not very large!,"I'm 6'8"" and 325. These gloves are tight and little hard to get on. As with so many gloves of this style that I have tried on, the size ratings are way off. These equal size ""large"" and NOT 3XL. I am still looking for gloves that fit. The best so far have been from Home Depot for about $17 ""FG"" ""All Purpose"" XL are a bit larger than these and are very comfortable to wear all day. Unfortunately they start wearing out after about a month."
2,Mechanix gloves,I ordered a xs size. The gloves are tagged with that size but must have been mixed up at factory. I have 4 other pairs if same size but these are quite a bit larger than others. They do not fit correctly. I will not purchase them from amazon again.
3,Gloves are okay,"These are the normal Mechanix gloves. Just like with most Mechanix gloves, its just a matter of what you do with them that makes them wear down. Got these and after a few hours, I noticed the stitching becoming undone near the pinky finger and thumb. The price matches the quality people, so I cant complain."
2,Great glove but don't expect to have it for too long!,"These are great work gloves. They are the closest feeling to working with your hands without gloves. However, they don't last long. The fingertips of my gloves started to tear after 2 months of intermediate use. If you're not doing any heavy work that requires heavy duty gloves it might be more economical to buy a box of nitrile disposable gloves."
2,Not just like the original,"I have been using these gloves for the past 6 years. I usually buy 2-3 pair at a time. Having worn out my gloves I wanted to purchase more so i bought these from Amazon. They are NOT the same as the original, the cuff is shorter and the cuff strap is shorter . The result is the glove is not as comfortable. In fact it looks like they have almost eliminated the cuff. They should not be represented as the same as the original glove. It looks like the bean counters have been at work. My fist pair was made in China & the pair I just purchased was made in Vietnam. Will be looking for better quality and fit in the future."
5,I am surprised by the feel . . . ( I was skeptical),"I got these in a promotion from Valvoline. I work a lot with thick stainless steel, grinding, cutting and filing, etc. Saves my hands from cuts, burrs and slivers.And do you know how much it costs to fix a ""grinder laceration"" to your skin? About $400.00, six stitches plus a lot of pain.I'm totally sold on these!"
2,could be better,"As far as size goes they are pretty close just a touch small but overall a good fit.HOWEVER they will not last if you do any kind of real work with them after just 2 days using them they began to come apart at the seam. This occurs along the sides of the fingers every time (my second pair, to make a fair judgement) and for about 20 bucks a pair they are pretty poor quality."
1,Not worth it,"I had a cheap couple of gloves which lasted for about two weeks, so I thought I'd buy these since they got good reviews. In less than a week my finger tips were coming out because the gloves were getting ripped. I work at a warehouse of a printing company in the shipping department so I handle boxes not knives... Completely dissapointed won't buy this brand again."
2,gloves,"Hole in gloves upon arrival.When checking into return procedures, purchaser had to pay for return postage, restocking fee and postage if item was replaced. Gloves cost around $25 and would've doubled easily through fees + postage. Never again."
4,Right size and great fit,"I don't understand why gloves are sold in so few small sizes. I have small hands and can rarely get ones to fit.I wear a man's 7, which isn't that small, but corresponds to the x-small size in this product.Well, they fit great.The only reason four stars is I hate the printed words on the gloves."
3,Good fit allows great dexterity- they just don't last.,"I've had maybe 6 pairs of Mechanix gloves over the past several years. For the longest time they were the only company to make such a glove. You just cant beat the fit, feel, and dexterity they provide. Unfortunately they never last.TWO MAIN PROBLEMS:1. Fingertips wear out prematurely.2. Seams at heavy bending points also seem to blow out.I always accepted this as the cost of doing business - and after all they aren't that terribly expensive.Now there is a plethora of brand options. I have been trying several of them. Generally I have seen relatively similar performance. Even the cheaper brands seem to hold up about the same.Bottom line:If you do a lot of work with your hands or even if you are more of a weekend warrior. You owe it to yourself to try mechaix ""type"" gloves. They work wonderfully when they work. I would just shop the sales and don't be afraid to go off-brand. You may be able to save a few bucks!"
3,"Shows potential, but that's about it","Track listing:1. I Say So2. ***** **** (""Pilot Park"" I assume)3. Silver Queen4. Everyday Shoes5. Pony Express6. Ever Rent A Heart?It is very clear that this CD portrays the very beginning of Verbena's music career. This is basically six demos thrown onto one disc; and that in turn doesn't allow for the best sound quality. Of the six songs, ""Silver Queen"" is probably the only one that stands out, yet all the tracks show great potential. Potential that would later become their 1995 album Souls For Sale. So for anyone who's looking for a greatly rounded sound, you won't find it here. But the longtime Verbena fanatics will appreciate this release and will enjoy the six songs for what they are. Don't buy this if you're looking for the same sounds on either Souls For Sale or Into The Pink. But again, if you're a big fan, it's nice to have this in your collection."
4,Excelente,"No conozco mucho de este grupo de Inglaterra, pero me encanta la mezcla de ritmo candombe con jazz, es muy distinto y diferente, soy gran fan de este ritmo de Uruguay tradicionalamente tocado por los esclavos rumberos,felicidades a Canyengue para romper las fronteras de musica latina con un disco impresionante."
2,Not what it appears to be,"Though this book seems to boast ideas for self-improvement, the title ""Individual Skills"" is misleading. I was looking forward to discovering some drills I could do on my own to improve my performance but when I got the book, I found nearly every drill listed requires full team. There are some good ideas for teams, but as far as individually, the book lacks in suggestions for self-improvement independent. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is playing recreational volleyball and looking to improve on his/her own time."
3,Good digilog watch.,This watch looks very nice. It bridges the gap between a nice looking dress watch with the functions of a digital (audible alarm/stopwatch/countdown timer/military time etc.)the colors and textures of the face are nice. I have never understood why watch makers add features like lunar and tide cycles to watches like these. Is there really a need for that? I think people get off to the gadgetry. Either way those types of features on this watch are unobtrusive and don't detract from looks or performance.
2,magnification,"The watch works fine.However,you need high magnification to see the bottom functions.No way can i see the tide or moon phase.Also,illumination could be better.No,i would not buy this watch again. Jack"
5,"The scope, the ideas...","Donald Moffitt just can't write about tiny things. His ideas become huge engineering projects, of such massive scope that it boggles the mind. Using a whole gas planet as as fuel, taking it along and protecting your ships from the radiation by putting them behind a moon is something that NOBODY would of thought of before. Yet by making it seem simple, if not also a tad ruthless, he makes the Cygnans seem totally alien. The scope, the time, the very sweep of their plans and projects force the reader to see them as a totally alien culture.In fact he did such a good job that Cygnans are in both Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials AND Clifford Pickover's The Science Of Aliens (along with a different artist's drawing of what a Cygnan looks like). The science of planet stealing might be questionable, but the design of the aliens, their history and their ways, in the book is a first class example of how to do it RIGHT."
1,"Rubbish, you'd be better off wearing toliet paper","I just finished using this sleeping bag on a 3 day camp and it was USELESS. I was freezing.We're talking July temperatures in Oregon (currently a 52 degree low), under a tent - here's how it fared:night 1 - wore very little (thinking bag would be sufficient), woke up cold.Night 2 - wore t-shirt and trousers and socks, woke up cold.Night 3 - wore fleece, t-shirt, shorts, trousers, 2 pairs of socks. Made it!I am NOT a cold person, but this bag just couldn't cut it. You'll need a campfire in your tent if you use this.When they say ""mummy sleeping bag"" it's because you'll need to wear every layer you own, turning you into a mummy...........piece of junk."
5,Total Relaxation!,"This cd has the most soothing and beautiful melodies! Although classical music and solo piano is not something I listen to on a regular basis, I decided to try this cd to help relax with an occasional bath. After listening to it I found every song to be so beautiful, that I now listen to it most nights as I wind down for bed. Can't say enough about how relaxing, and beautiful the music on this cd is!!"
4,"Very relaxing, a little monotonous","Nice relaxing music. I use for massage therapy, so it also needs to be soothing for my clients and enjoyable for me, and this one was fine, but a bit monotonous. Even tempo, no surprising loud songs, which is nice to find with piano music. Who knows, one day I may use it to take a peaceful soak!"
5,Peaceful anytime...,A peaceful soak...Yes... great background music in general...Yes. For those of you who like to unwind after a rough day... I believe you will like this.
5,An inspiring and uplifting collection of life's stories,Companions in Courage is an inspiring and emotionally touching collection of the stories of how over 50 athletes were able to cope with their misfortunes. Few of us go through life without being tested either physically or mentally. Everyone who has been struck with these problems and is looking for inspirational guidance to overcome their condition should read this book.
1,lousy,"lousy dvd, images look like it was copied from an even lousier vhs tape, with no sound just bad music, if i could have reviewed it before purchasing i would have NEVER bought it."
1,Looks dull in person,I chose this watch due to the shine and bright blue color. I got this watch for my son. I was not at all pleased with the appearance. Very dull looking. It just doesn't look like the picture.
4,Watch Face Darker than in Listing,"Pros:It looks like a much more expensive watchIt is very durableSurprisingly, it rarely pulls my arm hairIt keeps timeIt's face is not too large as seems to be the current fashionCons:It is a much darker shade of blue than in the description and listing. After opening the box, I thought I was shipped the wrong watch until I saw it in the light.It will more than likely require a trip to the jeweler to remove 1-3 links. It's possible to do it yourself, and instructions are available on the internet, but it is quite a bit quicker and easier to have a professional do it.I'm happy with it, and I have received several compliments on it. The blue color is much more apparent in daylight, and I have had three strangers compliment me over it since I bought it."
3,No illuminated dial be forewarned,"Not happy; it's an attractive watch, no doubt about that, but NO ILLUMINATED DIAL? Or a button to briefly illuminate it? Big drawback, I think."
3,Casio Analog Watch with Blue Face,"good condition, the strap was too long for my wrist however. i was forced to have it shortened at a jewelry store which was quite expensive."
5,I LOVE IT.,"Who when this watch was delivered, I thought someone made a mistake, Cause it is so awesome it's another must."
5,excelente producto,"llego en buenas condiciones completamente sellado y original ,me encanta este reloj gracias por el tiempo de envio recomiendo el vendedor"
3,Look for the case size,"Ensure you look at the dimensions before buying. The watch is too big for my hand. I bought it because I wanted a watch with less case thickness. The specs of this one say the case thickness is 5mm - I may be measuring it incorrectly but the thickness seems to be 8 or 9mm. Will also have to remove a few links from the band to get a good fit. Also, I did not get a receipt with this package and the Casio box wasn't completely/properly packed - looked as if it was opened before. Other than these points, this watch looks nice and more expensive than it really is."
4,I'm confused.,"The usual alternative take on what's going wrong in the world of money claim that an overly-close monitoring of currency is part of a plan to destroy the underground sub-economies that are part of a healthy economy. The same sources offer this book, which stresses the very control that I thought 'we' were supposed to be protesting. Also, if those in real power now -like- the way things are -already-,(much to our detriment), doesn't there have to be some kind of revolution first, just to allow us to have this choice?"
2,serious design flaw,"A height adjustable threshodld is a great product, and although this one has a great finish there is a design flaw in that it depends on locking washers to support the riser. However, these washers are not strong enough to withstand the weight of an adult stepping on the riser without collapsing down to the lowest setting. Someone on homedepot.com made the same comments but I found them too late. I took the washers out and created some blocks to hold the riser up. It looks great and seals up my door perfectly when coupled with the M-D door bottom, but it is no longer and adjustable unit."
5,The real life guide to colleges,"The writers do a wonderful job of analyzing where a good liberal arts education can be found in America; the result of doing diligent research about curriculum, quality of teaching and academic and student life. Some people may flinch at the accounts where politically correct colleges gone awry are substituting rigorous study for indoctrination but the truth of the matter is that students are losing out immeasurably when they fall prey to those who would destroy freedom of thought. A great guide which should be read by every thoughtful high school student."
5,Essential Reading,"In today's climate of ""tolerance for everyone except for those who aren't liberals,"" this guide provides an overview of what is really going on in higher education in America. It is essential reading for any parent, prospective student and for the colleges and universities themselves. Hopefully, the pages will be like clanging bells, sounding the alarm, alerting everyone of the danger we all face when the free exchange of ideas and beliefs is openly discouraged in favor of political correctness."
5,ISI Has The Right Stuff,"This is the book for students and their families who desire a traditional college education. I used an earlier edition to help my daughter chose a college because it was the best guide I could find. It still is. The students who were consulted by the editors have a real point of view, and this gives the campus profiles character and interest even -- and perhaps especially -- if your own point of view differs."
2,Not as described by reviewers,"From the editorial reviews posted, I expected a lot of information about HOW to choose the right college (as the title suggests). Unfortunately, only about 25 pages were devoted to this subject. The rest of the 970 pages are commentaries on specific colleges. Which would be fine, I guess, except that not one of the 5 colleges I'm interested in was included. No Virginia Tech? University of Richmond? Virginia Commonwealth University? All fine schools, but not reviewed.Also, there is no index, so if you are trying to find reviews of all in-state colleges for example, you will have to have memorized those schools to be able to find them in this book. If they are even included.In general, you won't need this book if you are not wealthy, as most of the schools listed are heavily weighted to the most expensive!"
4,City politics,This is a pretty informative and interesting book. I would reccomend it to someone interested in persuing an education in urban politics.
5,This is the best book on the subject I've seen.,"Rhodes' analysis of the jazz age is enthralling. I would recommend ""Structures of the Jazz Age"" to anyone."
4,"Wham! Bam! Thank you, Structures of the Jazz Age!","Sin-tillating! Chip Rhodes serves up his idle marxist speculations sensually, leaving the reader gasping for air and asking for more. When I got done reading this cultural studies texxxt, I was hot, bothered, sticky, and covered with hair clippings (because I had been rolling around naked on the floor of a barber shop). Whoomp- there it is!"
5,A must buy!,"As my title states this is a nust buy. Enjoy it slowly, one story ay a time. You will not be sorry. Consider purchasing the two collections of his novels also from Everyman's Library."
1,Find a different timer!,"I owned this timer for 1 week and it burned out, would not accept new batteries regardless of if they were defrosted or frozen, energizer, generic, duracell.I replaced the unit at my local Menards (the only unit they carry) and it also burned out after about 12 uses (I watered 2 times a day, 15 minutes each time.)Again I received a replacement unit from Menards and again it burned out after about 10 uses.This time I got a full refund and I'll never purchase a Nelson product again, I recommend you do not buy it either!"
1,"Nice design, poor reliability","Easy to use, thoughful design. Too bad that the valve broke on mine after 7 weeks. It broke in the ON position, so I came home to a mess!"
5,Highly Recommended!,I have owned this product for 3 months and I use it to water the front lawn and flowerbeds everyday for 30 minutes at 6 am and 6 pm. I love it so much I'm going to purchase one for the backyard/garden area. I have zero complaints and I highly recommend this to anyone. Our yard looks as healthy as the neighbors and he has an underground watering system. Our yard and flower beds have never looked this good!!!!
1,It's a hammer.,"The unit will hammer the water system. Unfortuately I will be replacing my water line because of the impact of the hammering. I had been gone for a week and returned to find my older galvanized pipes could not take the impact and failed. [Upside, the damage was not in the house.]"
3,NOT WATERPROOF,"We've had this for around 3 months now and it's a GREAT little timer. The ""choice wheel"" is huge so older or gloved hands can change the settings with ease.The battery lasts forever too. It's very cost-effective.The one and only problem we've had was in it's hardiness. The screws, rubber seals, etc are all waterproof. You can dunk it and it'll be fine.What's NOT waterproof is the buttons to the left of the timer.Ours leaked after a couple of months of use and died.We swapped it out at Wal-mart and the new one sits in a plastic bag, safe and sound and keeping things going.I even bought another one for our backyard. Cheaper than installing an entire sprinkler system and it runs when you want it to.:)"
4,Great tips,I thought I knew Photoshop but I was wrong. I borrowed this book from the library but it was so good I decided to buy it.
2,Enhancing cad drawings with photoshop.,"This book had many parts out of date. The Lisp program was not to be found in my photoshop CS 3 educational version. Autodesk VIZ is not in use anymore, the method works the same in differnt 3d programs. The calibrationsystem for the monitor was not to be found in the package Adobe offered for free download on the homepage. It is not included in Adobe gamma anylonger. The cad system is 2005 but this is ok because it is possible to find the topics in the helpmenu of Autodesk. The essential photoshop technics are very useful.Enhancing CAD Drawings with PhotoshopI would pay some more money and buy the new book by Omura called Photoshop for architects instead of this book."
3,Great Item,I love this product. It has worked better than anything that I have ever tried and I have never had it re-act to my system or other medications.
5,Excellent choice!!,"Once again the author has put together a fantastic tour book that contains all of the highlights of the area in one easy to follow guide. I own several of this series and have not been disapointed in any of them. Very well written, accurate and complete. I have been studying the Shenandoah Valley history for about 18 months. This books is a detailed summary of all that I have been able to find in that time. I wish it would have been available when I started my research, it would have saved me much time!"
3,"Good layout, but needs pronounciation guide next to words","I love how this book lays out the words to learn by theme, but I wish that the pronounciation was on the same page as the words instead of the back of the book. If my child is trying to learn how to say the words, it's annoying to have to flip to the back of the book to find the word and then figure out how to pronounce it."
4,Lovely book for preschoolers starting to learn German,"As a native speaker I rate this a good little book for beginners/ children. Useful vocabulary and colourful, big pictures. Link to internet pronounciation guide and there is a written pronounciation guide included. Personally I am missing e few short German sentences or stories, but I love the large action loaded pictures. So I can make up my own stories for my daughter."
4,If only my son still liked it!,"I purchased this product when I was pregnant with my son. With my daughter, I had always been self-conscious nursing in public places and wanted a cover that was modest. This was very large, and I found it easier to use than a blanket once my son was old enough to nurse without much help (it was difficult for me when he was so small that he needed assistance latching on, but I assume I would have had the same problem with any cover or blanket). Family members did tease me when I pulled out my ""poncho"" but it was better than accidentally flashing my nephews or having to lock myself in the only bathroom, for instance. When my son was about 5 months old, however, he refused to nurse with something over his head. Still, I don't regret the purchase, because just carrying it around with me helped with my anxiety over nursing in places like doctor's offices."
1,needs work,"Ugh...your hair gets completely messed up when you place it over your head. If it had a Velcro or a zipper opening, then maybe it would be a better working product. I wouldn't recommend it and sorry that I had purchase it. This product was a hassle. I was better off just using a receiving blanket. Waste of $$"
4,HP Print Cartridges,My daughter has an older printer that uses cartridges not readily available in warehouse outlets. Purchased products more than satisfy printing requirements; typical HP quality.
2,poor quality,"Printed documents are not evenly colored. I did clearn up the cartridge again and again using the ""clean up"" command for my printer, but it didn't solve the problem at all."
4,a pretty good cd to get into.... check it out!!,"A Different Drum always manages to put out interesting worthy cds. and this is no exception. John Giacobello is CTI. Sarah Silbert's vocals on jessica are a very nice addition. the cd is 48:54 long, so you get a respectable time on it. as for comparison, i think the petshop boys comparison is accurate in some songs. the vocals on this cd are clear and smooth, much like the pet shop boys. the song ""Twirl"" is one of my favorites on the cd. there are some good dance tracks on this cd as well. the song Jessica is the first single from the cd. it is a great song. Sarah's vocals are really cool on this track.is this cd for everyone?? maybe not, but if you like synthpop, you will like it. i will agree that i have a track i could maybe do without, but that doesen't change how i feel about the cd."
1,review of count to infinity,"I cant believe someone else reviewed this and compared it to pet shop boys. I did not see the comparison at all. Pet shop boys make music, this is noise like scratching youre nails on a chalk-board."
3,Worthwhile - But not for Beginners,"Stephin Merritt has yet to make an album or EP not woth owning, and this one's no exception, but bew warned that this is a dark record (even by Magnetic Fields standards). This was Merritt's intention; the Gothic Archies side-project was created specifically for the release of his most depressing songs. Mission accomplished: The tracks here are hilariously bleak, and the lyrics intentionally over-the-top (from ""The Tiny Goat"": ""The tiny goat was really very ugly/ And like all ugly things it fell in love/ When 20 years of waiting came to nothing/ It swallowed lye and laid down on the stove"").There are a few catchy tracks (""Abandoned Castle of My Soul"" and the minute-and-a-half ""City of the Damned""), but nothing that would qualify as classic or essential.Once again, it's worth owning, but if you're still in the process of building your Stephin Merritt collection, you should make this one of your last purchases."
2,oohhhh.....scary!,"this is a funny little record -- not particularly good, mind you, but likable in a goofy kind of way. this premise probably would have made more sense (and been easier to laugh off) as a single. i think merritt has finally spread himself too thin...."
1,bad format great book,this kindle version does not have a table of contents so it is hard to search this version of the book
5,smoking hot!!!,"Outstanding work!!!And smoking hot for shakers!!!from edison, ford, firestone... and beyond!!!"
3,This book is good but suboptimal.,"Napolean Hill's idea to think thoughts of success is correct. What we focus on has a big impact on our results. Hill uses the old model of positive thinking which has many flaws. Positve thinking is inferior to Optimal Thinking. Why waste time using positive thinking to seek good and great results, when you can use Optimal Thinking to achieve the best results. If you are interested in OPTIMIZING your success, you have to read ""Optimal Thinking-How to be your best self"" by Rosalene Glickman, Ph.D. She takes you past wishful thinking and shows you how to be your best self in every situation and how to think in harmony with your best interests. Optimal Thinking is simple and you can put it into practice IMMEDIATELY to optimize your success."
5,"A Classic, Updated","This is such a classic book, and it's very cool that it's updated with quotes from the moguls and figures of today. If you like inspirational books like this, you might like mine, based on my 18 years as a psychotherapist and life/business coach, helping them to become empowered financially, and in other areas like career, relationships, family, and health. See also:Self-Empowerment: Have the Life You Want!"
2,"Think and Grow Rich, 2010 edition","This is a great book, but this 2010 edition is hard to read. I was reading a paperback copy I checked out from the library and decided to buy this book. This edition has different wording and several words on every page are hyphenated, making it irritating to read. I suggest you purchase an older edition which is what I thought I was getting since this book was labeled ""original 1937 classic."""
4,Just like promised :),Was delivered timely and in great condition for a used book...just like they said :)
5,Ordering At Amazon.com,"The book I ordered was great. I re-read it just to keep my mind on track.Think And Grow Rich is a very great tool.However, when I ordered I pressed the submit button and later on in a fewweeks I am charged for some kind of updated fast shipping charge.$79 for the year. You get all your orders shipped very quickly, etc..Be careful when ordering.I never signed up for this, ever.I got a refund after calling Amazon.Should never have happened.Glad I check my Visa Statement Carefully."
1,this version is obsolete,"This version of ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill is antiquated and obsolete. It contains numerous errors. It contains language and phrases that are sexist and racially offensive. It contains ideas, specifically concerning scientific matters, that are just plain wrong and no longer valid. There are several good editions of ""Think and Grow Rich"" available. Any of them is preferable to this old and tired one."
4,Worth every cent,A fantastic book full of useful information which I have already started applying. Yes i will read it again it was so good. Thanks a million Harv.
1,1937 Version - MISLEADING book cover,"I have several versions of this book including 2 paperback, and 2 audio versions. This book is a reprinting of the 1937 version which is in the public domain.1. That means this version IS NOT the best expression of these ideas as Napoleon Hill continued to study Success until his death in 1970. He revised his opinions and wrote better versions.2. You can get a better version of this text by going to google and searching ""think and grow rich .html"" (without quotes)3. I bought this version because I wanted a searchable kindle text. This one is inadequate"
3,An okay book,"I chose the 3 star rating because it was just okay for me. There is a chance that with the application of the principles that it would have been a better experience, but I have a list of excuses as to why I haven't applied the lessons contained herein."
4,Deep,This is the kind of book you take in little doses. Reflect for at least a day after each chapter.
3,Im still thinking...,but no richer. Ok so what did you expect from a 1930's self help book? Fin to read from a historical basis.
3,At least think!,"I read this years ago. Recently I saw an infomercial for it with CDs and a thousand false promises. The informercial was funny to me because I knew I could buy the book for far less on Amazon.So why didn't the book make me wealthy the first time or the second time? I forgot how difficult it is to read. The book was written in 1937. The language speaks diffently from the way we speak. Also the author loves many of the same people who helped make Wall Street wealthy leaving out the common man.It's still an interesting read that causes no harm. It is, after all, a classic. I still can become wealthy!"
4,Good advise but lots of preaching.,"This book is a quick read with lot's advise on how to think and manage your life to be successful. I would recommend the read in this book if you have not read other motivational or self-help books. The book mainly describes 9 steps to think and grow rich. The term ""Rich"" is specific to understand that the reader should be able to grow ""rich"" in funds and emotionaly by thinking and doing the 9 steps described in the book. The writter pulls most of this thoughts from key successful individuals (i.e. Edison, Ford, and others),so specifically taking their thoughts, actions and motives into consideration the author has written a motivational book."
2,"The book is great, but not this print","This print of this great book is filled with spelling errors to the point of annoyance.Thus for those who prefer a level of quality, please purchase another cover version"
