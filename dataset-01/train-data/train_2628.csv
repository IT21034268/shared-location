5,Sony NP-FP71 InfoLithium P Series Battery,Have used for 2 months and very pleased with battery life and performance.
4,Graet Machine,I have had my Jr for over 10 years. It is a great machine for the price. Battery replacement do it yourself -- $30 -- Don't pay any attention to those who nit pick it. Great workout and practice machine.
3,Unable to use,The impeller puller would not pull the inpeller out of the pump that we had that we needed to replace. WE were not able to use this tool. We had to send the pump off for service to be removed at an additional cost.
3,Needs Updating,"A fairly good overview of outer space that kids will enjoy, though it has fallen a bit behind the curve in several areas. - For example, the number of moons around Jupiter & the status of Pluto as a planet. I bought this book for my grandkids, but after reading it I filled up two sides of an index card with corrections. I put the card inside the book before I sent it to them so they could know the current facts. I also passed on the address of the NASA website for kids (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/kids) so they could continue to keep pace with new findings. I think the actions I took might be a good way for author Carole Stot and her publisher to make things right until they can offer up a revised version of the book."
5,An excellent primer on the phenomena of space,"This book is an excellent primer on the phenomena of space that is written at the level of the elementary school child. Using a combination of colorful images and effective descriptions, the author starts with the question, ""What is the universe?"" and covers galaxies, the life cycle of stars, black holes, the sun, the bodies that orbit the sun, the Earth and planets, rockets that leave Earth and enter space and why astronauts wear space suits. When your child asks you their first question about space, this book is an excellent choice for explanatory conversation piece."
5,Fantastic book.,This was a great book. It told me a lot about space and the stars that I did not know. Now Iam realy fasinated by the stars. The book told me How fast rokets go. How high you can jump on the moon. And other fasinating facts.
2,"Glass measure ""Nice but . . .""","I ordered a 6 cup Catamount Flameware measuring cup and absolutely loved it! It states that it is dishwasher safe, but mine cracked coming of out the dishwasher. I loved it so much I then paid for a replacement and also purchased an additional 2 cup size. Unfortunately, the 2 cupper came out of the dishwasher ""cracked"". I am rather disappointed that I cannot even locate the manufacturer to express my concern. Not sure whether I'll re-order again. It's a shame-I loved these measures, they are great, but due to lack of ""company support"" and having to constantly replace, they are getting to be costly items."
1,Bennington Flameware Measuring Cups,"I have ordered Catamount's Bennington Flameware measuring cups, 10 oz. and larger, and every one broke. The 10 oz. one had the bottom break off. Others had the handle come off or break in another place. So far, I have ordered four of them, different sized. I expected them to hold up very well. They didn't."
1,really bad...,"I am a huge fan of parody (Weird 'Al', Dr. Demento, Bob Rivers, etc). This one, though was a struggle to sit through. I was really disappointed in nearly all of the songs included in this album, especially the title track. My recommendation is collect most of the others, but leave this one out of your collection (of if you are a completionist like I am, leave it for looks, but to collect dust)"
5,Been a Fan,Needed some new songs for my Christmas light display and have always liked Bob Rivers' take on the holidays.If you haven't heard any of his tunes listen to samples on this site.
4,Great Parody,Really clever lyrics and spot-on vocal impressions. I was especially impressed with the Karen Carpenter voice. Even passed it along to my wife and daughter who really enjoyed it.
4,Brings back memories,"An earlier reviewer described the music on the CD as new-school dancehall. I must politely disagree -- the reason I like this CD is because the songs are old classic dancehall tunes from the late 80s, early 90s, not new school by any means. Many of the artists aren't even really on the scene now, and the riddims are very different from new school dancehall, which has been heavily influenced by American hip hop. This album (and it's companion volume) would be an excellent choice for veteran dancehall fans who remember when these tunes first came out and would be glad to hear them again, or for more recent dancehall listeners who want to learn more about the earlier history of the music."
4,very nice,"Yet another collection of the new school of dancehall, though the names and songs on this collection are quite fresh and exciting to listen to.You probably know many of the names on this collection- Johnny Osbourne, Foxy Brown, Ninja Man, Shaba Ranks, and Cutty Ranks, and one of my favorites of the new school, the Pinchers. That's what makes this collection a decent one..good names, good grooves..Nice collection..just listen to it."
5,Couldn't be Better,"Small venue, excellent sound recording. Lots of visuals involving moving blue and red lights. You can see what they play listed on Amazon. The guitar solos are off the hook!"
2,too small,I recently purchased these shoes for my daughter's 4th birthday to go along with her Cinderella dress for her party. She does not have wide feet (in fact she has fairly narrow feet) and these shoes were very snug and she wouldn't wear them.
4,Best DVD version out there,"I'm not a big enough fan of classical music to really write a review that will do any justice, but...this DVD did not dissapoint. Especially the piano concerto. Very good, excellent recording, and camera shots caught about everything I wanted to see. Very talented orchestra and conductor, I have been to only a few concerts that were better than the one on this DVD. If you must stay at home instead of going to the concert hall, then buy this DVD to tide you over until the next concert."
5,A must have for relaxing,This is quickly becoming my most-played CD! It's great for relaxing (especially after a long day) or doing pilates. Highly recommended for fans of ambient!
4,Inspirational and fresh,I loved this book. The approach to leadership is fresh and the metaphor of wizard and warrior gave me a lot of inspiration.
4,Great debut album,"Ever since I saw this band live (which was the first I heard them) they've been one of my favorites. This is a really talented group of cats from Minneapolis who have a made a punk/indie rock debut album of which most bands would (or should) be jealous. The album kicks right in with the highly energetic ""At Wit's End."" The rock doesn't stop for the rest of the album. While some songs aren't too incredible, they certainly aren't weak either. And the great songs (read: ""At Wit's End,"" ""A Touch of Nostalgia,"" ""Did You Get All That,"" and ""Just Pull the Trigger"") more than make up for any possible weak points. If this album is any indication as to what we'll be seeing from this band, we are all in for a real awakening."
3,Not very fast paced,"The book effectively and accurately presented the facts but, was wasn't fast pace enough to keep my interest. I will say that it was very exciting in the way that it desribed the USA vs. Soviets game. Overall, it was good but not good enough to get that fourth star."
5,Love it!!!,the bonus track 'miss you' is amazing and it's worth buying charmbracelet again just for that perfect track! BUY NOW!!!
2,Looks a bit cheap,The reviews I read were positive but I was dissapointed with this item. The chain was very thin and the pendant looked a bit cheap and unsubstantial. I guess you get what you pay for (as the old adage goes).
3,Nice pendant cheap chain,"The pendant is very nice and just as described. I was very disappointed with the chain. It's not as pictured, it doors not have the extension and is a very thin, cheap chain."
2,Disappointed,Most of the songs on this CD are much different than her original released singles and radio cuts. It is a good CD but would rather have had her original recordings.
5,Best of the Best....,"I came across an old cassette that I had recorded an album of Deborahs' (Delta Dreamland) and it reminded me that I had not heard her music in a long time. So I searched Amazon and found that title on CD and this one also. I purchased both. She has a lyrical style that is exceptional and unique. I really enjoy listening to her music. This particular CD has some excellent examples of her music and highlights the best points of her career. Thank you Deborah, your music is greatly appreciated!!"
1,Should have been entitled THE WORST OF!,If you really want the best of Deborah Allen get the anthology or Delta Dreamland(if you can find it).Why is it that most country stars start out great and then go downhill from there. Carlene Carter and Pam Tillis are excellent examples where 2nd album titles should state Completely Different from the first album or Less Rock/more ballads. Do record companies purposely do this to get rid of old acts to make way for new ones? Very unproffesional and very dirty. You have a terrific voice Deborah and I hope you sign up with another record label so you can rise back up to the top.

3,A dubious achievement,"This album is notably different from GW's previous three. While she has increased the instrumentation on this album, the arrangements are spare. Whereas earlier work involved GW and David Rawlings giving intricate arrangements with only two guitars and their voices,this album generally has drums and a few whatnots over GW strumming a guitar and singing. It's an interesting change but I am not very taken by it. I have listened to it 5 times or so now, and have simply found that I think this is mediocre for her. One song ""One Monkey"" is the first by her that I would flat out call deplorable. I've not yet been able to sit through this song the whole way through!I might listen to this album occasionally for something different and because I think GW is a much better musician/songwriter than most, but it won't sit in my CD player the way ""Time"" or ""Revival"" did."
3,great photo of Rawlings!,"The first album by Welch that has instruments other than simple guitar accompaniement. The simple back-beat drum arrangements on a few tracks rock--kind of like a gun-slinger-Lucinda Williams sound. I wish the wurlitzer organ was used more prominently (it only makes a brief accent to one song.) The lyrical imagery and little song stories are not as strong on this album---I agree with the other review that ""One Monkey"" goes nowhere. Production is a little lame; a few of the songs almost trip over themselves in the intro. Another bummer is the lyrics are not printed on the insert, the photos of Welch and Rawlins in the insert are classic though."
2,Where's David,"As a big fan of Gillian Welch and David Rawling, I am left asking where's David. I miss the harmony and David's acoustic guitar. No knocking Gillian for trying something new but always felt Gillian was only half of what made this duo so special. What was Simon without Garfunkle?"
2,Oh-me-oh-my-oh,"""Soul Journey"" demonstrates that angst plus talent doesn't necessarily result in art. I liked the opening track, ""Miss Ohio."" I have four of Gillian's albums and enjoy listening to them. I regret purchasing this recording."
4,Definitely could have been a couple of songs shorter...,"There's some great stuff on this CD. ""Look at Miss Ohio,"" Wayside/Back in Time,"" ""One Little Song,"" ""Wrecking Ball"" and ""One Monkey"" being among my favourites. There's a couple of songs, though, that just don't rise to Welch and Rawlings usual genius and you wish they'd held back until they came up with better ones. ""I Had a Real Good Mother and Father"" and ""Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor"" particularly just don't do anything for me. They're not bad, but they just don't go anywhere and ultimately detract from what could have been a really great CD. It's frustrating to listen to therefore as I find myself skipping past the ones I don't like."
3,Just not up to the high standards of the others,"I've been hugely affected by all of her previous albums, each in their own way evoking a plaintive open road lonliness, or a inner squalor of sorts. They are all beautiful. But this record leaves me cold. Throwaway songs, redundant lyrics and additional instrumentation that doesn't live up to the hypnotic interplay of just the two guitars of David and Gillian. It's also lower budget and her voice isn't recorded as silkily. Overall, these feel like 4-track demo outtakes for songs not good enough to make it on the other records. I look forward to the next release."
4,a worthy alternative to the ipod,pros:-sound quality-battery life-DRIVERLESS operation!-when you want to replace it you can sell the drive inside and get your money back-size and weight-good alternative to the ipod if you don't want to be like everybody else. it's also $50 cheaper than the ipod mini.-pricecons:-small screen (in my opinion this is a very minor problem as an mp3 player is designed for listening and not looking at the lcd)-small controls may be difficult for some-carrying case provides a lot of protection but blocks off access to all of the controls!-this player is very rare i ordered it from walmart.com and it was on backorder for a month.Overall this player is very good and is a good alternative if you're not willing to get an ipod mini for any reason. My main complaint is that the protective case that comes with the player does not have any openings to allow access to the controls.
1,Warning - if you're only buying for the 4GB Drive,"I bought this product based on advice to raid the 4GB drive at half the price for my Sony F828 camera. It didn't work, giving a CF card error. Then I found that I'm not the first sucker to fall for that trick - I found several bulletin boards with messages from similarly disappointed people who tried the same thing. As far as I can see there's not a solution in sight. The same appears to apply to some other cameras."
2,Small Hard Drive,"The Nomad player adds nothing new to the table and as one of the previous reviews points out if you buy this device with harddrvie seperatly the price goes way up. Overall I guess this could be a good deal if you planned on selling it on Ebay, but as for the player I would just move onto the IPod.Everything this device does well the IPod does better sorry Nomad..."
3,First in a series of excellent MP3 players,On enjoyable piece of equipment that allows the portability of music listening in a simple compact lightweight design offering ease and comfort.
4,"For audiophiles, the sound quality, problem of bass","Everything in this player is magnificent. You probably know all the goods of this player and are looking for some demerit of it. The only thing I found that is not very satisfactory is the Equalizer and the sound quality. There isn't much bass in the sound. Sure you can turn up the bass in the equalizer, but that doesn't make much improvement. Plus if you turn the 100Hz all the way up, audible distortion can be heard in the bass. The mids and highs are clear and crisp though. I am using a Sony MDR-EX71SL headset instead of the one that comes with the player."
3,Difficult to use,"My problem with this device, that I have just bought, is getting tracks into the correct order. The player plays tracks in alphabetical order, unless you manually adjust tags. One minute I'm listening to Bach, then to Red hot chilli peppers. Playlists are played in order, but the supplied software reorders tracks within artists alphabetically, meaning that without intervention it is impossible to keep albums in the correct order. This is crazy. Generally the operation of transferring and organizing content is poor to awful"
4,Little dissapointed...,"Looks like this ended up being a verion 2 unit... too bad, very nice MP3 player though, but not the ""original"". For my purposes did not matter though. Great player!"
1,THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER SEEN,"I bought the 4GB Creative mp3 player and it was delivered within 2 days: good start. I installed the software, transferred the songs, everything worked okay. I played it for 10 minutes (LITERALLY TEN MINUTES) sitting in my living room, and after 5 songs, it stopped playing. none of the buttons worked, it was frozen. I followed the directions on rebooting it 500 times, but nothing worked. I sat for two hours with the piece of junk trying EVERYTHING to fix it, and nothing worked. I should have known, you buy cheaper, you get cheaper. I should have gone with an ipod mini. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY HAVE TO SEND IT BACK. I didn't heed the warnings from the reviews I read... I wish I had. what a disappointment."
3,This product sucks as MP3 player but love the Hitachi 4gig,"For another $50 you can get a mini-iPod. Don't waste your money on this for an mp3 player. It's butt-UGLY, software sucks and it's got the cheapest case. There is no style to it, and you could do a lot better for just a little more money with an Apple mini iPod where you can download your music off the iTunes store, and look cool to boot.The look and feel of this product next to the iPod is just not even comparable, let alone the packaging and the black cable madness you have to deal with when you get the product out of the undestructible plastic case. The tiny lcd screen that you can hardly read what song you are playing is awful. The buttons to control the thing suck.Do what I did and harvest the hard drive and use it in a good digital camera (like a Canon 10D, or 1D) and be done with it.5***'s for the Hitachi removable compact flash drive though. Works great!"
3,"Great deal, impressive size, unique design.",I think this player was a great purchase for the price that I paid.
4,Seniors can create positive employment after retirement,"So many seniors remain healthy and look for ways to be productive citizens after retirement. Why not seek new outlets to use one's skills and get paid? This book names diverse roles where retired seniors can work but is careful to explain any limitations or factors the senior should consider before attempting a specific role. As Baby Boomers age, this issue will only progress in importance. I applaud these authors for writing this book on such a timely subject- all written in large, easy to read print. I plan to share these ideas with seniors at my church and in my neighborhood.This would be a great gift book for seniors or anyone approaching retirement."
1,False Advertising,The jacket looks a lot cheaper in person. It's flimsy and looks like it could tear easily. Also the Large is VERY large. You should spend a bit more money on something else because this just isn't worth your time.To be honest I rather throw this away than deal with returning it.
3,Size does matter,It looked really larger on the picture. It's useful but is tiny. The quality is also a little bellow than expected but it gets the job done.
5,Ah Toots!,How can anyone not love Toots. His playing is just beautiful and full of love. He also plays subtle but brilliant arrangements. Wonderful back up band. Well recorded with CD quality sound.There is only one Toots and I would give him 10 stars if I could.
5,the man,"toots is the best harmonica player ever. he is four heads and shoulders above any other player. check how many records he has appeared on it will blow your mind. this dvd gives you a great insight int the man and some of his fine work. i fear that when he is gone, there will be no one to fill his shoes......................."
5,Excellent product,Bought this to study for taking the national test...passed!!! I liked how it was like listening to friends just discussing different subjects and not just one person reading from the book
4,very helpfull aide to the real thing,"These CD's are great for listening to while driving along, or while doing housework. In this day and age I don't have time to always pick up my text book so this is a great alternative. The pace of conversation is good, not too fast not to slow.I would highly recommend this CD series to others taking or looking to take the EMT-Basic course or if you are looking to recert. This should qualify for all your Basic CEU'sI only wish that I was working from the same text as the publisher of these CD's, however having a difference in publishers sometimes provides more details and explains the some things in different ways.Best of luck.....Future EMT students"
4,Great study aid,"I just received my National Registry Cert for EMT-B and Plan on going for my EMT-I within the next year. Hope I can find a series like this again for the next step. You're in class for long periods of time, sometimes after a long day of work and the amount of information that your instructors are trying to feed you is just too much to take in one sitting. I found that listening to these lectures in the car helped keep my mind sharp and in the right mind set. They can't go into everything completely in depth but it's still a great tool to prepare you before class or to help emphasize something in class you may be struggling with."
4,Nice archival item,"Great selection, only bothersome thing (and this appears in others of this series) is that the speed is off, and usually fast. Hopefully on subsequent releases they will take more care in production. Mountain was one of the finest bands of the early 1970's. Leslie West's tone was ( and still is) to die for!"
5,Cargador para la camara,"El cargado de la cámara , recibido fue bueno. Todavía lo tengo y funciona correctamente. Muchas gracias por el envio"
3,Olympus Charger,"Charger works fine, but it does not signal when barrery is fully charged. Battery will be ruined when overcharged. Factory one had a green light when battery was charged."
3,Women,"The short stories wasn't what I was expecting, but they all were good. Different places, people styles etc. I was quite pleased."
3,Kenneth Cole KC3436,"Lightweight, thin, accurate. The only problem I've had with this watch is that the crown proturdes past the base of the watch. I've had occassion to snag the crown on clothing stopping the watch. Since I'm aware of the flaw I've worked around it by being more aware of my surroundings. This did not happen on the older model. The case of that model was shaped in such a manner to ensure catching of the crown did not occur."
5,Great dog house,"Excellent construction, heavy, quality product. Living in rural, northern climate with winters that bring -40 degree weather and high winds - I know if my dog is outside during the day - he has a place to be warm."
1,Bitterly Disappointed,"After much anticipation, I'm so disappointed. We received our Petmate Indigo XL Dog House today ,February 2, 2012, and the arch at the top of the house entrance was broken. A piece about 6 inches by 1 inch was broken off, leaving a jagged sharp area that could seriously injure my dog if she tries to enter the igloo. What a bummer. I just visited Amazon's return and replacement site and was prompted to agree to return the entire igloo for a replacement. What a pain. The igloo is huge! If anyone else out there has had this problem, please let me know what you did? This igloo was $196.59 including tax! That's a lot of money for a defective, dangerous, and visually ugly product. Any suggestions?"
1,Does not work,Just bought this item and I have to return it. It does not charge and shuts off all the time. Will return it. Yuck! Money wasted!
1,Horrible Item,"This mp3 player, if it can be called that, is a piece of junk. The picture makes it look good but the body is made out of cheap plastic and it feels as though it will break if you push a button. It really looks like a rip off iPod nano, and is the same in quality. The screen has zero definition with regards to pictures, music played alright but it only worked for a matter of minutes!! It was all good and fine until we hooked it up to the computer then we got an error message that it couldn't read the hard disc, and started making a clicking sound until the battery went dead. I wouldn't give this to anyone. I am attempting to return this p.o.s. to the company I bought it from. Seriously, dont buy this item."
2,Not a good place to start,"I absolutely adore Virginia O'Brien, but this CD isn't for anybody but die-hard completists like myself. And anyway, the best thing about Virginia is seeing her facial expressions. I'm doing my best to collect all her film songs on video. But if you want to hear her singing in her prime - hunt for her numerous Old Time Radio appearances on ""Command Performance"" - many are available for download from OTR sites via FTP."
5,hours of fun!!,"great fun, but must be done with an adult!! make sure you buy plenty of goo because making bugs is hours of fun so order extra goo when you purchase this item."
5,A Meaningful Perspective,"I have been married for over 32 years and during that time I've also read a plethora of books on the subject. Sacred Marriage is far and away the best of these books I have ever read; the purpose of marriage, its challenges, and the identification of a proper perspective regarding this most intimate of human relationships are all woven together with a deep sense of faith, and clear direction. I facilitate a college group and recently purchased 10 copies of the book to share. The response has been incredibly positive, and rewarding."
3,Good recommendation for Christian's,"A wonderful read with a strong Christian foundation made me feel like not giving up on 20 yrs. I'm trying to balance the hope and wisdom from this read to the simultaneous realization I'm in an unhealthy irrational emotionally abusive marriage. I don't know the future, but I do know that God is close, will guide me, and see me thorough."
5,A Must Read For All Engaged or Married Couples,My recently engaged daughter was given this book by a co-worker who said that he gives it to any engaged couple that he knows. Come to find out it was one of the books that her recently married friend and fiance had read and it was their favorite! I picked the book up one day to see what it was all about and immediately ordered it for myself. I am reading it and sharing it with my husband of 22 years. I am so thankful for this book finding its way into our hands and know it will make a world of difference in not only my daughters marriage but in mine also.
5,Sacred Marriage Book,"Loved this book! Gives you a whole paradigm shift on marriage and it's purpose. It was a BIG help for my marriage. My husband and I read it at the same time, some chapters together and some seperate then discussed it together at the end of each chapter. I highly recommend this book for all marriages, if youv'e been married a short time it may head off some problems or if youv'e been married for 19 years like we have it can be a great help!"
5,The Book (and the video series) is a must-have!,"Gary Thomas asks, ""What if God's purpose is to make you holy, not happy?"" What a contrast to the ""... and they lived happily ever after"" themes found in almost every movie, novel and marriage manual. We led a small group with this warm and very real resource."
5,Excellent read,"This book gives such insight to the God's purpose for marriage! It makes complete sense, and Thomas takes the time to say things that we should already realize but really need to have articulated and need to be reminded and challenged about. Really gave great, fresh perspective on my relationship with God and where that places my responsibility for my marriage."
5,Great book,"This book is filled with good personal accounts. Thomas provides good advise and direction for married people. From what I have read, this book seems to be inline with the Bible."
2,sacred marriage,The photo of the book that was shown did not match the book. It ended up being the wrong edition with the wrong study questions for small group that I needed it for!
1,Boring and Impersonal,"I guess I have to be devil's advocate, but this book to me was just so drab. I only read half of it because I couldn't get through how the author just kept saying the same things over and over. And the chapter about finding God in sex was ""too heavenly minded for any earthly good"". If you are a new Christian or an engaged Christian, you might find it insightful."
5,great book,this is a must have for anyone that is working on keeping thier marriage a complete sucess helped me alot.
5,eye opener,"This is a book that will make you rethink your role in your marriage! And in today's society, where everything is focused on whether or not I am happy, it's a different perspective. Would be a great book for a book group too - lots of material for discussion. While it does not give all the answers, it is worth a read, to ensure that our expectation/focus in marriage is what God expects..."
5,mnes,"I used this for a weekly Bible study for a newlywed couples group. It is an excellent resource and delves more deeply into the spiritual aspects of marriage. I highly recommend it - not just for newlyweds, but for all married couples wanting to move their relationship toward more Christian maturity. As a pastor, I also give this as a gift to couples when I perform their wedding ceremonies."
5,Delightfully insightful,"The insights I found in this book have been incredibly helpful to me in my relationship with my girl friend(soon to be fiancé). Reading this book has giving me a totally different view of marriage and my responsibilities to my future wife, and God, with-in marriage. I would recommend this book to anyone in a serious dating relationship or is engaged."
5,Best in Class,"One of the best books on marriage ever written. A unique perspective and practical guide. My husband and I have been married 29 years and we found this book, even now, to be very help in jump-starting the next phase of our life together. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a solid, successful marriage, no matter what state you're in."
2,Struggling to get into this book,"The author poses a thoughtprovoking question in the title; however, it's been really difficult for me to get into this book. For example, I do not agree that the expectations for marriage should be lowered. If marriage is an institution ordained by God how can I set low expectations? I'll keep reading, but I know it's going to take a while."
5,Amazing experience,"Thomas has a way of writing that captivates the reader. I am not married, but I am a spiritual pereson in a long term relationship and I found this text enlightening. He presents issues and difficult situations in a different light. Anyone, married, single, dating, Godly, or otherwise should read this book to get an idea of what a true, lasting relationship looks like and the time, dedication, and selflessness it requires."
5,Worthy of good writing,I've read one chapter in the book. And I'm pleased with what I've read so far. I'm looking forward to seeing what else is store with regards to this book.
5,GOOD BOOK!,I just need to say that if you are unsure of purchasing this book...BUY IT! It is wonderful.
5,Read this if you plan on getting married some day,This book is a must read for anyone considering getting married or already married. This puts marriage into prospective of its real purpose to edify us. I loved it. Buy this book for engaged couple or newly married and/or even those who have been married for 50 years!
2,MEH,"The author came off as a bit arrogant. He had a few good points but honestly... I literally went ""MEH""."
1,Marriage is a cross to make you a better Christian,"My husband and I read through most of this book last winter. The main theme/point running through the book is that marriage is a form of martyrdom a cross of suffering. Which if you hang in there will hone the couples Christian characters into something beautiful. I am sure his wife gets the warm fuzzies every time she thinks about how its such a sacred pain to be with her,that he stays because it makes him feel more righteous and pure due to all the suffering he goes through being married to her."
3,"Somewhat bland, but enjoyable","This is an average book in every way. The main characters are mildly interesting and have minor flaws (like Noel's tendency to to order everyone about and Claudia's tendency to be too lenient with her stepson). But they don't stand out from the crowd, are not memorable. Claudia's original china was a nice touch, though. All the additional romances were obvious from the beginning and almost seemed intended to fill out a skimpy story. All were pleasant characters. Only the vicar was unique, and he was not likeable.The book's a pleasant read, but there's nothing exceptional."
2,Neck Guard???,"At under 2"" of coverage I'm not sure who's neck this would protect. I thought I was getting something that would protect my neck not just a little spot. I would return the two I bought if it were easier."
3,you get what you pay for,"not bad. vader mask is NOT a full head thing. just covers the front of your face. and you need to wear your own black clothes under the costume. it's just the vest, mask, and cape (and lightsaber. which is actually pretty cool.)"
3,Charger works....but not a Genuine JVC part,"I ordered this battery charger because my original was misplaced. I liked that fact that this was listed as a 'genuine JVC Adapter' because I didn't want to mess with companies I didn't know. The adapter arrived quickly and works fine for my camera, but it is not genuine JVC. The company even has its name printed on the adapter-WholesaleLaptop. I will keep, but felt the product was misrepresented."
2,Not comprehensive,"I would not recommend this book. Many very common wildflowers are not included. Because most of the photos show only closeups of the blossom, without leaves or full views of the plant, identification is difficult. I haven't investigated other books, but I would urge you to look at others before purchasing this one."
2,Buy the original cd,"Buy the original cd. Usually the Mobil Fidelity cd's sound AMAZING, but NOT this one. Not sure what happened here, but the noise floor is much higher and it really does not sound any better than the original. Really shocking!"
2,I liked the original recording more...,"I bought this having high hopes. After listening to it, compared it to the first release, and went back to the first release. (same situation with the Pixies Doolittle MF gold digital master...)To me, it feels like a lot of the ""energy"" was lost in the cleaning up. Too ""air brushed"" for my tastes.My system: Naim CD player, Rotel Preamp, Mark Levinson ML-9 amp, KEF 104.2 Reference speakers and DIY cables."
5,Good resource,This book is a good resource for interesting facts regarding business history. I recommend it for anyone who might needs subh facts.
4,Horror in the country,A longer story than usual by this author who mostly wrote short stories. Well written and classic folk horror story.
2,Treacle,"I picked up this book because of an interest in its Appalachian setting and the folk and magical beliefs of that part of the country. I was disappointed in that, because the villains here are a standard, boring Satanic cult; little in the book escapes cliche. At the same time, the usual sex and gore found in horror books are missing, which means that it isn't even entertaining on a base level. Wellman's protagonist, John, is never really challenged or in danger. He's too much of a nice guy, too flawless, and consequently boring. Also, the constant unthinking, sentimental Christian references give the book a sickly-sweet, treacly quality. Give this one a miss."
5,My 4 yr old loves it.. and so do I,My daughter loves this leapster and its very educational. Great investment..I love LeapFrog!!!!Thank God for LeapFrog!!
5,Great Game!!,"My three year old absolutlely loves this game - and to think that he's actually learning something too!! This game was accidentally thrown out the window of our car on our dirt road in July (I thought it was lost)- I found it while walking our dog in November and it was squished, had been rained on run over etc. and it still worked in our Leapster. So the games are pretty tough too!"
5,Great Game,My 4 year old GRandddaughter loves this Game for her leapster! I love the leapster game to BUT it's very fragile! I've returned it 3 times now. My granddaughter gets very upset when it just stops. No it's not the batteries. She's only 4 so she's not rough on things yet but it has been dropped on the carpet on one of the occasions. The others were just a mystery.
3,"not bad, not great","The graphics on the hand held are better then on the TV. It's still fun to watch it on the TV and the kids like it. I admit, I am probably just spoiled. My only big fault I have with this is that the response time is slow when moving down or to the left in one of the mini games. She has to jump from rock to rock and turtles and logs and stuff. many times it requires you to hit the keypad more then once. since we got two leapster l-maxs and games for Christmas i was afraid it was the l-max that was acting up. I took the cartridge from one l-max to the other and found it to be the same problem. it was definitely the game. other games we got didn't seem to have this same problem, or at least as bad."
3,Dora the explorer,"I bought Dora for my 4 year old son for Christmas. Both he and I found it to be boring after a few games, even with increased levels. Maybe my son is more advanced than the average preschooler. However, he loves the leap cartridge that came with the leapster. It allows him to design pictures and seems a little more challenging."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!,"This is one of my sons favorite leapster games. Hours of endless play, we almost have to pry it out of his hands, so I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. Would recommnd to any child who enjoys Dora and Diego."
4,The Runaway Slave,"This story is called STEALING SOUTH : A Story Of The Underground Railroad by Katherian Ayers. The underground railroad is people that help others escape from slavery. I think you would like this book if you like stories about slavery and freeing slaves. This book has 201 pages. In the beginning of the book, Will and his brother Tom are helping Noah, a slave, escape to freedom. Tom dumped bacon grease on his shoe to confuse the slave hunter's dogs. In the story they help get slaves free by sneaking them out. If you want to know more about this book I think you should read it."
5,A great adventure.,"If you like very adventurous books you should read this book called Stealing South. It is about a boy named Will. He helped a runaway slave cross into Canada. This runaway's name is Noah. He told Will that his brother, James, was going to be hung. Noah pleaded with Will to go on the journey of saving James, using an arrow head for proof that he is not a slave catcher. Will is taking cover as a peddler. He meets many enemies and a few friends. The rest is left a mystery to you unless you read it ."
2,Mrs. Brown's 4th Grade Class,"Stealing SouthBy:Katherine AryesI didn't really like Stealing South because I thought it was boring because you would read letters for two or three pages. I thought it had good details and explainations that the author wrote. But I just didn't like it, some parts were confusing. I would recommend third through sixth graders would like this book."
5,amazing,"A very well written and informative publication. Dr. Strichart is a master in his field, and has continued to produce guidlines that we utilize in our school system on a daily basis.Bravo!Dr. Steinhelm"
5,Fantastic tool for ALL students,"These are good study strategies, whether a student has special learning needs or not. And with the ability to photocopy, this is a valuable resource that more than pays for itsself!"
5,A great tool for teaching!,"I bought this book based on the reviews written by previous buyers, especially the one that the buyer said they would not have survived their learning strategies class without this book--and I 100% AGREE! The way this book is arranged makes it very easy to make lesson plans and to make copies and overheads. The students understand the material and enjoy the exercises! This book is worth every penny!"
4,Great music,"The problem with films today doesn't seem to be actors abilities to convey the material but the material actually being strong enough to be worthy of a movie.Russell sort of disintegrates-lite as a rogue cop and Rhames spends most of his time being righteous and trying to figure out a way to capture him. The LA riots as a backdrop was a nic etwist but this bad cop--kinda good cop who's lost his way film has played on for too long. The big suprirse of the film is that Russell's character doesn't die at the end. Generally there's a triumphant fatal ending that redeems the bad cop in some way but instead Russell admits his crimes.Michelle Michael is very strong here as well as Khandu Alexander but the third act of the film seems to be locked in by the choice of Russell coming clean or dying. Perhaps cop movies have been segmented by so many other films that it's hard to find an original spin on the ""impossible job---must become as dirty as those you hunt"" premise."
4,Excellent small camera,"I would qualify myself as an amateur who likes to record stuff when on a trip, a walk in the woods, a cruise around town, or with family. I am very happy with my purchase of the F10. It makes great photographs, it is quite intuitive for most of the important features. The small size makes it easy to stow away in a coat pocket, although I now use Fuji's carrying case that has a belt loop, which should be more convenient in the sumemr. An important part of why I love this camera is that I basically don't have to wait to take the next picture even when using a setting that produces a file size of 1.4Mb."
3,Happy but not completely,"Happy with the watch except it is only waterproof to 3 ATM when the website said it was good to 10 ATM. I specifically chose this model so I could swim with it on, so I was not impressed to find it is not fit for purpose."
1,VERY BAD DESIGN,"It is looking 2 usd s watch, photo is really very different. Cheap and ugly. I dont like this watch."
1,Low quality,"The watch is really nice in view, but the bracelet is really easy to scratch and also the build quality seems not good. I had problems when removing the watch from my arms. Also it is tricky to adjust. I do not recommend this watch in any way. I regret buying it although it is very beautiful."
3,first watch,"so far. im happy with the watch. although its rather easily scratched, got a few after a couple of days of using it. the band is scratched and faded a little. probably due to me being in front of the computer the whole day."
2,Bad craftsmanship,"I bought this watch as a gift for my husband. Within a few months of normal wear, the glass face fell off and the metal rods keeping in some of the links also fell out. We had both problems repaired, but the next week, we noticed that the 4:00 indicator had come loose and was moving freely. Since we had just had the watch repaired, we decided to let this go. Then a few weeks later, we noticed that the metal ring around the date function was loose as well and moving to the right.My husband has only been wearing this watch for 6 months. I've never had so many issues with one watch, and this is the most expensive watch I've ever purchased for myself or someone else. I am extremely disappointed in this brand after hearing such a good things originally."
4,Skagen Men's 596XLTXM Multifunction Titanium Bracelet Watch,"great watch for the price. i have had it for 4 months now and had no issues. titanium band is very light and great for everyday use. you can barely even feel it on your wrist because it is very slim and light. show the date, day, and hour of the day in each of the bezels. great feature for the price. the only complaint i have is that i wish it formed to the wrist better, because the band does not fall flat it curves around the wrist instead so there are spaces on each side between the wrist and the watch. otherwise it still is a great buy and great product."
2,Not as nice as the picture,"For starters the watch is not the same color that appears to be in the picture. It is actually a very light grey watch which was not what I wanted, in the picture it looks dark grey. The rest of the watch is overall nice."
2,time jumo,"I like the watch overall. Very sharp looking, lightweight, I normally wear watches many times the price of this one but take this one over them. Only problem is on two occasions the watch jumped forward 45 minutes to 1 hour. I am pretty sure it was 45 minutes each time but not positive and think it would be weird for a watch to skipp ahead that increment. But i am pretty sure it happened at one time and not over time, but not positive. I returned and will try it again, we will see..."
5,"Good looks, thin, light and inexpensive","I love thin and light (titanium) watches. Comfortable for daily use.The features are rich for a watch this inexpensive.I've always liked Skagen, owned one until I accidentally broke it. This one is a keeper!However, I would like it even thinner, maybe about 6 or 7mm thin (this one is 9mm)."
1,Pretty but poorly made,"Looks great, but beware! Five months after purchasing, the glass just fell out while I was reaching for a magazine on an airline flight. I've done nothing rough with the watch, and the plane didn't depressurize. In fact, I have been especially gentle with this watch because it looks so good and I didn't want to get it scratched up. I now have to pay an $8.50 ""warranty charge"" in addition to registered shipping."
1,"Run, run like the wind","Well, after seeing this watch in an airport, I thought I'd check it out. I read the iffy reviews and decided to buy it anyway. The first thing I noticed was that the band scratched at the slightest contact with any surface, I wrote Skagen about this and never got a response. Next, the calendar dial is constantly obscured by the watch hands and needs to be reset after every 30 day month which is a real pain. Finally, the the crystal cracked without provocation as described in another review and when I checked the warranty, it's not covered. There ya have it, tonight I just threw a hundred bucks in the garbage can."
4,Great Watch,"Beautiful watch! The slim design makes it very unique. The face is really simplistic and classy that makes for some nice compliments. However, the finish does scratch somewhat easily on the bottom of the band. Glass seems pretty tough. Highly recommend for the price!"
4,Boyfriend loved it,"I got this watch for my boyfriend for our anniversary. He is very hard on watches and I was weary of spending $[...]on a watch that I knew he would break. He absolutely loved the gift. It lasted him about a year (which, believe it or not is a good amount of time for him). Now, 2 years after him breaking that one, I saw the price of this and decided to get it for him again. I know he'll be very pleased when he sees it!"
3,Nice Slim Fashion watch,The watch is very slim. The design is very nice. The dial color is Grey and NOT black.The titanium could not resist daily wear scratches. My other steel watches are better scratch resistant.The packaging was not that good. It was open from 1 end(it was not even in a box). The watch was in a manufacturer provided plastic case with seal on it.
3,love the look but not the function,I bought this watch for it's stelthy looks but after only 8 weeks it stopped. I figured it was the battery so I e-mail Skagen to get the correct size but they never responded. After installing a new battery it still dosen't work. I expected more! I suppose I will have to find a watch repair shop.
4,a beautifull watch,Thin and light it's a dressy watch for any occasion. Too bad it's not waterproof to at least 100 meters.
1,Save Your Money,"Definitely not worth the cost.Comes off as very synthesized. As I was listeningto it on my 6 thousand dollar system, it suddenlydawned on me. ---""This sounds like midi music that I can find for free, online.""Stay away from this one. ....."
2,"Love the music, hate the DVD","I have been a fan of Stephane Grappelli for almost 30 years. OK, not a ""fanatic,"" but someone who appreciates the master's sense of joy and unparalleled artistry on the jazz violin. I was excited to find the listing for ""... in New Orleans"" on Amazon and quickly added it to my wish list. I even feigned surprise when it arrived in time for my birthday.I should have left it at that. This DVD is an ""amateur night"" production. The audio is technically OK, but the video is uninspired, at best. If you really like this music, save yourself some grief and buy a couple more CDs instead. You'll thank me, and Stephane Grappelli, for it."
4,Excellent Illustrations,"This is a well done book which shows illustrations of typical clothing of the ancient Greeks throughout several historical periods. The drawings are clear and accurate as are all of Tom Tierney's similar works. This was an invaluable aid to designing an historically accurate costume for my 6th grader's ""Greek Festival""."
4,Great costumes,"The drawings and costumes are exquisite, like most of Tom Tierny books are. The explanation of each type of costume is well-done and easy to understand. My only exception to the product is the near nudity--tastefully done and, I'm sure, just done to show authenticity, but it may be something to consider if you are buying this for a child."
1,To Be precise,"This book is about developing a writing style, not about techniques, the nuts and bolts of editing a first draft."
4,helpful,"One of the publishers to whom I submitted my book declared that they wouldn't accept any manuscript that hadn't been worked over according to the principle in this book. I complied, and though the publisher still didn't accept it, I learned some valuable tips. When I finally did publish my book the editor found little other than misplaced commas to correct. My biggest disagreement with the authors centers on the dialogue markers ""he said"" or ""she said."" Using them exclusively becomes monotonous, though it works as a rule of thumb. To be fair, their mandate pushed me to think of new ways to identify which character was speaking, and that has made me a better writer. The principles in this book also sharpened my ability to discern what I like or don't like in a book or a scene, which has also improved my writing."
5,Reasured and feeling confident,"I just finished the first chapter of this wonderful book. I found examples, followed by exposition explaining the sample, then an updated illustration. The intended point could not be clearer. I have purchased many books over the years about writing. This is the second book, after Mr. Orson Scott Card's book on character that I enjoyed reading. Why does that matter? If I am going to learn something about the craft of writing, I have a much better chance of learning if the teacher can do what they teach. Sadly this is not always the case. This book is engaging from the outset, it held my interest to the end of the first chapter. How can I be so effusive at the end of chapter one. That is the point of the book, engage the reader, Browne and King nailed it. I do not write a lot of reviews but hope that this review will help garner this book the audience it deserves."
5,"Excellent primer, helped me edit my first novel...","This book served to facilitate my editing process during a time crunch. I read Self-Editing with an awareness that writing ""rules"" don't apply in all cases, and I came away with numerous ideas to strengthen my first novel. Publishers and writers alike will be grateful for this book. Additionally, Self-Editing makes for a wonderful macro companion to Elements of Style!"
4,Self-Editing for Fiction Writers,"Very helpful and written in simple, easy to understand language with lots of examples of how to do, and how not to do."
5,Fabulous! Great! Superb! Outstanding! Primo! Wonderful!,I learned more from this book about EDITIING than any other book or class on WRITING I have read/taken. Just amazing.
1,kindle version is missing all the illustrations,The kindle version is missing all the illustrations. Many of which help illustrate key points in the text. They also add whimsy to the writing.The kindle apps can show pictures so I don't know why Amazon decided not to include them. If you want an electronic version of this book (it is a good book) you may be better off using a different service.
5,Like my college course on fiction writing,"If you look at the front cover of this book it looks like the book is about fixing grammatical mistakes and typos. Not so. This book covers issues such as showing rather than telling, voice, and avoiding repetitious language. The key to what makes this book work is the many before-and-after examples the authors use -- including from published works. The small amount of grammatical instruction focuses on accepted modern style, such as saying ""Bob said"" rather than ""said Bob"". This stuff is invaluable -- like a very smart critique group. I'd love to see the authors come out with a workbook, so we had even more examples, but there are many exercises at the end of each chapter."
1,Kind of useless.,"I had to buy this for a class, and it didn't benefit me at all. It was a college level course, but this is stuff that should have been taught in high school. Ultimately I stopped reading the chapters when they were assigned."
3,Self-Editing for Fiction Writers,"I won't be able to give you an honest opinion for a couple of months. This is the first straight forward book I've found on editing. Whether it's accurate in its assertions or not is still out with the jury. If I don't sell the manuscripts I'm working on, I'll blame this book's guidance. How's that?"
1,Where's the beef?,"Could not get this book out of my house fast enough. (I felt guilty giving it away to Goodwill to some unsuspecting person.) Recommended by an English teacher friend, I purchased it and found a very, disgruntled, ego-driven author inside. According to this author, the only good novel is a screenplay: dialogue only, please. (Example: Fitzgerald, as it so happens, was an ok writer, but when this author *re-writes* Fitzgerald's scenes to include dialogue-only and no descriptions, well! Now we are supposed to see the genius in the scenes not evident before! Thank heaven for this interlocutor.)I'm being snarky, because I feel betrayed."
5,Most Useful book I own,"Unlike books like The Right to Write which strive to release the writer within, this book gets right down to improving your existing fiction manuscript, or make you anxious to start the project you've been putting off for too long. Although much of the material is covered in other well-written books on the subject, Browne and King were able to get through to me and make me slap my forehead and go ""Duh! Why didn't I think of that!"" more than once. I have already signed a contract to publish my first book, but Self-Editing has shown me countless ways to save me and my editor loads of time and heartache."
4,Must-read for a fiction writer,This book covered some important topics I had overlooked and induced me to run through the novel I'm working on just to fix the things it talked about. Lots of good examples taken from existing published literature and the writing workshops the authors conduct.
5,"Terrific for editing, but also for first drafts","I've found this book to be extremely helpful not just for editing a completed draft, but also for helping me get more right as I write, and even encouraging me to write in the first place. Sometimes I'll have a story that I want to tell, but I'll get stalled at the beginning; picking up this book and reading through some of the advice can jog me out of whatever has me stuck, because usually what has me stuck is one of the flaws that this book helps writers overcome. Highly recommended."
5,Tired of rejections? Revise!,"Browne and King's small book is a life saver. Their advice allowed me to quickly recognize problems in my novel-in-progress and showed me how to fix them. What began as revision of a first chapter soon became revision of an entire manuscript. Now much improved, it's time to go after the publishing world with renewed vigor."
5,A wonderful book that will open your eyes,"I didn't want to pay thousands of dollars to have someone edit my novel- especially if I am going to e-publish it myself. This book offers great examples of what NOT to do and how to make your writing better. I may just read this again! When editing now, I can see all the awful things I was doing and can correct them with ease. I highly recommend this for anyone that is in the editing stage of writing!"
4,I'm a researcher of Nazi Germany material.,This 3-disc series is well laid out and the information flows along very well. For me-- I enjoy watching this material from time-to-time. It's worth the money.
3,Assault on history,"This is not a very good DVD, poor production, sound quality is not to good , but worst of all its biased toward the American side of the story, and leaves out alot of behind the story type naration."
2,Lew W.,"I don't own this computer, but have a Presario 1500 that I need to replace because of overheating/shutdown problems when running more than one program, or very large ones. This is a very frustrating problem that can cause you to loose all unsaved work when it happens. The CD burner has also quit working. This is my second Compaq computer and I plan to try a differnt brand soon to see if the quality is better."
1,Too hard to find and not worth the search,"This album is really dissapointing. Compared to Dictated Aggression by M.O.D. this cd is nothing. The best songs are: Devolution, The Angry Man, and Timb Bomb. The rest of the album is punk/metal that is mostly boring."
1,"Hard To Find, Not Worth The Search","For as hard as it is to find this album it just doesn't deliver. The best songs are: Devolution, The Angry Man, and Time Bomb. These really are the only tracks worth listening to. This album is just too bland and seems like you've heard it all before. It's also a lot more punk than metal. Go check out Dictated Aggression by M.O.D. instead."
1,how old is it?,This watch only works with Windows 95 or OLDER software! Do you remember where you put that old computer you replaced 10 years ago?
5,Exactly what I was looking for,Practical as well as economical. First most ring sizes well (except larger men's rings) and doesn't gather dust like velvet.
5,Pure and Simple,"Although the Slip are really a live band, this studio excursion is still fantastic. Highlight tracks include Get me with Fuji, Sometimes True to Nothing, Tinderbox and Love and Tears. The whole album is very cohesive while still being representative of The Slip's eclectic nature.As soon as people start embracing music that is truly creative, passionate, dynamic and energetic, The Slip will go multi-platinum. All we can do until then is buy their CDs. I highly recommend ""From the Gecko"" in addition to this CD. It's still another aspect of The Slip, from another time period, but it's equally fantastic."
3,One of the forefathers of hand to hand combat,"Dont get this book if you want to learn fighting techniques get it to own a piece of history and to learn about one of the men who advanced our fighting forces skills. If you own Kill or be Killed ,Get Tough and Cold Steel this would be a good addition."
4,Excellent,Provides a very clear summary of a large area of introductory biology with helpful metaphors and illustrations. It be a useful prep for a high school biology class.
3,not bad...,"I'd like this shower curtain better if the holes for the hooks had grommets and the curtain were heavier gauge.Looks good, though."
2,A softball cave book,"I bought this hoping for some information regarding Oregon's lesser known caves. I didn't have any description to go on from Amazon, so my review will hopefully help others following in my footsteps. This is a book solely about the Oregon Caves National Monument. It's also written in the most dumbed down language possible, it honestly reads like an interpretive plaque on the side of the highway. It does have a cool map of the cave system, and if you like pictures from the late 19th and early 20th century, you're in luck. Other than that though, wikipedia is gonna have way more information about this cave system, and you'll be spared the child-like reading."
5,Picture Poetry on Parade,"If you like Shel Silverstein's poems, you'll love Joseph Sottile's ""Picture Poetry on Parade."" Sottile writes for the young, and the young of heart. His words tickle the brain, nurture the soul, and gladen the heart.Because my work allows me to speak with teachers throughout the country, I have tucked Sottile's book (with delightful illustrations by Lori DeLeonardis-Aman) into my well-worn traveling case. I plan to share this gem with my fellow educators, and I'm certain they will want to share it with their students. Sottile and DeLeonardis-Aman have presented society with a gift. Try it. You'll like it.Jacquie McTaggartIndependence, IowaRetired TeacherProfessional SpeakerAuthor: ""From the Teacher's Desk"""
2,"Good titles, but has problems",I bought this CD because of its excellent selection of titles. But found that three songs have some of the on-screen words missing. Which makes it difficult if you're not really familiar with the song.
3,Seek the right audience,"I think the backside blurb of the book has sought out the wrong audience. ""Heinlein if he had read Gibson"" says Sawyer on the back of the book. So we expect a writing style similar to Heinlein's - the younger Heinlein at that. But Hendrix has a style different from Heinlein's - not the same tendency of going straight for the main point and the action, for one. So obviously those who seek for more Heinlein will be disappointed. As we can see from the reviews below.But Hendrix premises are intriguing; present him on his own premises, and evaluate him from that.(I had to get this review off my chest even though I am still at the beginning of the book. My rating is therefore still in neutral - 3 - until I've read the book to the end.)"
2,New-age technobabble about consciousness and enlightenment,"The book is about the ""enlightenment"" of the universe.Most of the book are technobabble about consciousness, with not much actually happening.Unfortunately, the author uses a lot of technical words without knowing their meaning."
1,Confused and unenlightened,I've been a Science Fiction reader for most of my life and have rarely come across a more unreadable book. It was very disjointed and served 'philosophy' to an unendurable point. The premise was interesting and drew me to it in the first place. The best comparison to be made with this book is to New Age pseudo-science and not Science Fiction. The use of complex (poorly understood) wording and longwinded discussions without basis does not serve the reader. The techno-babble comment from a prior review was well founded. Not recommended.
5,Good book - works for me,I'm a golfer that has frequently had some degree of lower back pain. Suffered a severe lower back strain four months ago. Bought the book and started the routine after that. It has made a big difference for me. My back feels better than it has in years. I strongly recommend the book.
5,Knowlegable about exercises,"I have not yet read the book in question, but I read the review from the person questioning the validity of the MDs research. I have seen the program on television, and, as a physcial therapist, I can tell you that most of the exercises I saw being performed were exercises that are fairly standard to physical therapy practice."
2,reader,If you never exerciesed this could be useful to you some of theexercises requires midesction strength before starting the program.
4,Back exercise,"I like the book. Simple explanations and pictures of the various exercises makes it easy to pick it up, read a bit and begin doing the exercises. And they seem to work, I've been doing them for about two weeks and feel a difference. The author is an MD and gives, I feel good advice on living with and reducing back pain. It's certainly worth a try especially if you are considering surgery."
4,really good and effective,author gives the basics of backpain and causes which we overlook in general. first you should beleive in the process(dont make the pain to take control over you as it is more mind+body related) and follow it sincerely. Only difference what i found is that it takes around 30-min and not 15-min for any of the series a/b/c.Back RX: A 15-Minute-a-Day Yoga- and Pilates-Based Program to End Low Back Pain
1,Still looking for a good yoga book in CA,"While I am glad that this type of book helped the reviewers who gave it high marks - anyone who has been to physical therapy for their back pain has been given the exercises that were covered. After looking through the content cover to cover, only 2-3 positions would qualify as ""yoga"" and the rest would fall under ""floor exercises"" or ""home exercise program."" I think the title was misleading as I was looking for a book showing yoga positions in succession of difficulty w/ clear explanations on how to graduate more advanced positions based on your skill level and back issues. This was not the book I thought it was going to be."
5,recommended by my physician,recommended by my physician after a steroid shot. gentle but effective exercises are very helpful in maintaining flexibility and strength.
5,"perhaps the best Korean drama ever, and that's saying a lot","There are many themes discovered throughout Dongyi. King's royal duty for his country and personal love for his woman, Queen and concubines' battle inside the palace, politics and hideous plots against the innocents, brotherly love between two princes, and the courage to fight the good fight without compromising with evil. Many ideals of Confucianism is well presented here. The main theme I saw was choosing the life of sacrifice instead of the life of personal gain. In any case, it is just full of good stuff, nothing like trashy Hollywood material. Plenty of sword fighting and marshal art scenes as well, thanks to actor Bae Soo Bin who plays Dongyi's protector Chun Soo."
2,Not worth the money,"I agree with the earlier review by R. Cook that this program, although helpful in some ways, just isn't worth the money. It's very basic, and although perhaps useful to a very new investor to help organize his thoughts and investing strategy, if you're a more experienced investor, pass this one by. The quotes by famous investors such as Warren Buffett are sort of interesting, and the company report feature is useful, but overall, fifty bucks is about twice what the program is worth. At least for half that price it qualifies as an interesting but at least cheap diversion. Also, the package I got was the last one on the shelf, and it had obviously been returned since it had been opened and the CD removed from the paper sleeve. So whoever got it before me had returned it. I might do the same if they'll take it back."
5,Passionate and Fun,This was my first Historical book I have ever read. And i have to say it was very passionate and the characters were wonderful and very down to earth. 5 stars all the way.
4,Kept Me Interested,"Great book. I was interested from start to finish. Great character development. Started getting a little bored with the ""I can't be with him even though we are so in love"" plot. Worked out in the end. Christina Dodd has a very engaging way of writing a story."
1,Linda Howards' White Lies,"Sorry folks, but this is the historical version of Linda Howards's book WHITE LIES. This is the second time (in a row) that Ms. Dodd has used the plot of someone else's book or movie. Her last book was a remake of Sabrina."
4,Her best yet!,"I've read a lot of Christina Dodd's work, but this is definitely her best book so far. Enid and Kiernan are a perfect match and really made me laugh. You won't regret this."
1,deja vu,"Even though I do like CD's writing, I gave this one only one star because it is the exact same storyline as Linda Howard's ""White Lies"" which was published about a decade ago. It is the exact same plot and characters, except that Howard's book was set in contemporary times. I'm very disappointed that I keep spending money on her recent books only to find that I've heard the story before i.e., ""In My Wildest Dreams""/Sabrina and now this latest book. Ugh, I may have to give up reading romance novels for awhile..."
3,Don't Judge a Book by it's Cover,"The cover, I thought, was beautiful and the best thing about the book, really.I've read several of Christina Dodd's books (and most of them I liked), but this one is my least favorite. For a spy/espionage type romance, I didn't find it all that exciting.Kiernan became particularly annoying once he remembered who he was. I did like Enid as a heroine, however. She was the best thing about the book.Maybe next time..."
4,light and breezy,"this book is all it should be not only documenting the series/episodes but the text mirrors the feel of the show ,frustrated and funny. there is a photo from each episode discussed . the book was in great shape ,arrived quickly and was had for an unbelievable price."
5,Great Fun/Interesting!,"This is a very interesting and complete look at the ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" TV Series. Alot of great interviews with the players and interesting facts on the shows beginning concepts and who was involved. For instance, I had no idea that David Letterman had anything to do with this show. The photos in the book are large...of the set design during the filming. Great fun and informative."
5,If you love the series? You would like this one.,"Oh!! i just cant get enough of the series. This book brings you inside stories, pictures and what not. Yeah, it does not cover all 9 seasons, but is still a great buy @ Amazon. Because they sell it pretty cheap here.Go ahead and get one. You would love it."
3,Incomplete...,"I purchased the entire ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" series on DVD. I thought this book would be good accompaniment for the DVD's. While I agree with the other reviewers that it is a great book, it is incomplete. Why would they publish a book about a T.V. series, but leave half the 8th season and the entire final season out of it? Why didn't they wait until the series was completed to publish the book? For this reason, I give the book 3 stars instead of 5."
5,My daughter's only doll,"My daughter is not very girly and loves American history. One of her favorite personalities is Ben Franklin for his wit and wisdom. I gave this to her for her 16th birthday and she was crazy for it. I would always hear Ben's words of wisdom echoing from his place of honor on our mantel. The clothing was good quality, loaded with details. His voice is clear and has an interesting tone, one that I think Ben might have posessed. His quotes inspiring and amusing. What started out as a gag gift ended up being a true winner!"
1,Sorry I brought this,"Minnie Driver was so good in Good Will Hunting and Jeremy Renner in Hurt Locker but this was a bad movie, sorry I got it."
2,Mary J. Blige would have a fit if she heard this....,"Anyone else notice something familiar about ""Bounce""? If you said the beat and vocals are refreshing and heart felt, almost reflecting the early days of Britney Spears, well then you sir are a moron.The somewhat catchy ""Bounce"" has only one big flaw to it, and it's a BIG one. Didn't Mary J. Blige put on ""Family Affair"" in 2001 with an almost identical back beat? I think she did, and it's not like the song credits Mary J. for the sampled beat.That aside, there are a couple mixes to ""Bounce"" with a different vibe to each. There is the radio US mix which is nice, smooth despite a horrid rap break. There is also a German R&B mix, which is much edgier but comes off too much like the early days of Pink.I'd HIGHLY advise to wait for a second single before you invest your money in her album."
3,"Good Production and Singing, But My Least Favorite","I think my title says it all. I like the authentic Japanese feel of the production, and the singing is mostly very good. But I consider this the weakest of the ""Madama Butterfly"" film versions, because I just don't like Yasuko Hayashi as Butterfly. Sure, she's actually Japanese, and her voice is near perfect for the role, but Butterfly is a role that requires good acting, and I think Hayashi falls short in that department. If you think Japaneseness (is that a real word?) is the most important thing in a ""Madama Butterfly,"" get this one, but if you want a good dramatic performance with a convincing actress in the title role, I reccomend either the Ponnelle film with Mirella Freni, or the Mitterand film with Ying Huang."
5,"""Dermaphoria"" and ""You Poor Monster"" in the same year!","I heard about Craig Clevenger through Michael Kun's website, about a year ago. Kun is the author of ""The Locklear Letters,"" and, more recently, the stunning novel ""You Poor Monster."" A lot of us have Kun to thank for finding Clevenger's ""The Contortionist's Handbook"" and, now, ""Dermaphoria."" I just hope that Clevenger's fans find Kun. For these two guys, who apparently are good friends, to each put out a masterpiece within 6 months of each other is just amazing."
3,"A Good, Whirlwind Read","Well written and a good story, but doesn't hold a candle to 'Contortionists Handbook.'IF YOU HAVENT READ 'THE CONTORTIONISTS HANDBOOK'.......read this one first. That way you won't be dissapointed.Can't wait for the third book!"
3,"It's got style, it's got substance. But can it fly?","Craig Clevenger's latest brings everything you could want to the table: suspense, msytery, a unique writing style, and an adequate story line. Unfortunately, he never quite gets off the ground; the plot and characters never seem to develop. Most of the dialogue is simple one-line pieces, and he offers little explanation of the characters and their wants, desires, and personalities, except for the protagonist, Eric, who constantly talks about a girl he loves but can't find. The book isn't bad, it just isn't that great.I would recommend his previous novel, The Contortionist's Handbook, instead of Dermaphoria. Also, if you want a great story about a guy who loses his memory and has to put his life back together, check out Will Christopher Baer's Phineas Poe trilogy (which it actually feels like Clevenger is almost trying to copy with Dermaphoria)"
4,Dermaphoria by Clive Clevenger,"If you liked ""The Contortionist's handbook, then this will please.He has a certain ellipsis of style that is most effective - less is more.This book is a rush and should be read as such. It is to be engaged and consumed with attention for maximum effect. The immersion will be worth it in imaginative terms. His writing is confident and direct. It is fresh and immediate in its impact and is sufficiently intelligent and clever to hold your attention for the duration. Wholeheartedly recommended."
4,Let me get to the point...,"Because many other reviewers have given a good summary of the book, I'll skip that part.Dermaphoria is a great read. At times, I felt a little lost along the way and had to push myself to go on without fully understanding tidbits the author was offering. But in the end, wow. The story line is amazing. The author's writing is amazing. I would definitely recommend to anyone who's a fan of contemporary fiction."
3,Up and up.,"More detail, more twists, more plot and character development. Clevenger's novels are getting better and better. Although the last one was a little light for my taste, I actually had trouble putting this one down."
2,Is he drunk?,"I have been accused many times in life of not finishing a thought, but not only does David Whyte do this as boringly and as perfectly as possible, but I dont see what any of this have to do with dealing with middle age! Im 1:41:00 into this now and I cant keep my eyes open."
5,A real gift,"I am in awe of this CD. It has a beauty I have rarely encountered and I am thrilled with my purchase. My wife also shares my 'affair' with these CD's and we are the better for them. Neither of us have had much interest in poetry, yet David Whyte has such a way with words that we both feel very much converted!"
3,My Ratings for The Purple Purse,I bought this purse as a gift for my mom who loves purple. I thought when I ordered it that she might not like it because it would be to big. Unfortunately when it arrived it is very small. She likes it and uses it but if you plan on using it on a regular basis you have to purchase a much smaller wallet. But it is very nicely made. Other then the size it is perfectly fine.
2,Picture is somewhat deceiving,"The picture for this product makes the jade look intricately and well carved. In real life from more than 12"" away it is indistinguishable from a round hunk of jade. The cuts are so shallow they simply don't pick up enough light to even show it's been carved. Literally everyone has had to ask what it is . . ."
1,do not buy!,supposedly water resistant???? when i even start to think about sweating. the watch steams up. worthless do not even consider.and trying to get it worked on? forget about it
1,Beware choose another,Watch looks good when you first get it but within 2 weeks band color was not only coming off but the pins were falling out... I returned it for another skagen watch with the mesh titanium band which I am very happy with... Amazon should drop this item....
3,Techno,"Take 5's new CD ""Against All Odds"" is ok. It's got a lot of techno beats and they digitalized their voices on most of the songs. So if you're looking for a techno boyband this is your CD, if you're not into that type of music don't waste your money. I give them credit for trying but to me out of all the songs I listened to most of them sound a lot like ""Shake It Off"">"
5,Let your speakers have some fun!,"Like Destiny's Child? Try Take 5's ""Against All Odds"" then. They are probably the closest equivalent. Rather than mostly singing about being mistreated by men, they, of course, sing about their love for their girls. The party songs are there though. Check out the first 3 tracks for a good, light-hearted time. Give ""The Girl Next Door"" a listen, and it sounds really silly, then wait for the bridge. The ballads are few enough that they don't bore, and the guys actually can sing alright. One of my favorite new cds."
3,BEAUTIFUL TO SEE AND HEAR,"This lavish romance epic set in the 17th century has gentle British noblewoman Lady St.Columb (Joan Fontaine) fleeing her spineless husband (Ralph Forbes) and his lecherous, dangerous friend, Rathbone, who lusts after her. The production is stunning in lush color with Claude Debussy's ethereal ""Claire de Lune"" as the picture's theme. A wonderful tearjerker and Rathbone excels as the menace."
1,Horrible. Doesn't work!,"I purchased this charger because my original Nikon charger was stolen. My camera battery was dead....camera would not turn on. I put the battery on the appropriate charger and let it charge overnight. The next morning, the light on the charger was still flashing, the battery had NO charge. I left it on while I went to work. When I came back that evening, NO CHARGE. When I put the battery in the camera, there was just enough charge for the camera to turn on and tell me critical battery, then turn off. I was pretty ticked. As I was looking for a different battery charger, I saw reviews of this product on Circuit City's website....all were negative reviews. Wish I would have seen those."
1,Defective,"I purchased two copies of this book. Both of them were missing pages 1 through 9. I returned the books and was very happy to receive a prompt refund. Very disappointed though, that I didn't receive the complete books. I've never seen anything like this before. Can't imagine how it got through the check process. It's also unlikey that my two books were the only ones missing these pages, so I don't want to take the chance of ordering them again."

3,Fun journey back to the 70's,"I've had this book up for sale on Amazon for a long time. I finally decided to read it. It's a fast read, with some interesting twists. Some elements of the plot are left unexplained, but it doesn't really matter. Still, it's a good mystery story. Arnold never got involved until it affected him personally. If you were in college during the turmoil years (as I was), many elements will hit home. Not great, but lotsa fun."
1,"Do Not Purchase, wait for the Revision!","This book has very good and little known information on Maryland Indians, but the biggest problem is that it has not been revised since 1959 and was reprinted with the errors in 1981. The last two pages of the book contain the sentences, ""Indians have disappeared from the Maryland of today. and Even though Indians have vanished from Maryland,..."" The last US Census count in 1998, listed 15, 779 Native Americans in the State of Maryland. The Press Director of the Maryland Historical Society has refused to grant permission for editorial changes changing the language to say Indians are alive in Maryland, even though it is within his power to do so. This is tantamount to documentary genocide and as a Native American Marylander, I am offended, that the Maryland Historical Society would continue to offer a book that denies my existence. Do not buy this book, but contact the Maryland Historical Society and demand a reprint that states the truth!"
3,Just a little extra help.,"Well it does what it says, it indicates the wind direction.. Will it be essential to my hunting set up? i don't think so, i only bought this so i could get free shipping on another purchase.But, there are often situations where small breeze's can be difficult to judge, or if the wind is swirling, and i'm sure this will help determine the wind in those situations. If the wind is gusting this will be pretty much useless, apart from maybe passing some time in the tree stand whilst waiting for a shot.Bottom line, i view this as a non essential, occasional use, hunting accessory maybe it will prove useful at times, mostly it will just be a bit more gear in my bag.Safe hunting!"
2,Wind ?? If your upwind it's to late!,"This will work well and did for me untill it was to late. I found myself stocking a big Mule Deer and I was so involved, I checked wind direction again. To late, the wind had shifted and he caught my scent.Now I use a new one that has 3 uses in 1, attractant, cover up and wind detection ""Fireless Smoke"" check it out. Comes scented in Pine, Earth, Sage, Cedar and Deer and Elk Scent. Often I find myself using it to make sure I am upwind. It will save you from letting the big one catch your scent."
1,Fell apart within 5 months,"A little history. I had a sunbrella cover for our old Circle J - it lasted for 11 years. For our new trailer, I bought a Beverly Bay cover. Only problem, it ripped on the zipper within the first 3 months. The top started to rip and fall apart (became gray dust) within 5 months. Then the sides started to rip like wet toilet paper at 8 months. I learned a valuable lesson when I bought a Classic Accessories Cover for our 32 ft.travel trailer. It has a Tyvek top and much better construction. Therfore, I just purchased a Classic Accessories horse trailer cover. I live in Southern California - so rain was not a factor. Too much sun? Maybe."
1,worst trailer cover ever,"I purchased a standard two horse trailer cover from Beverly Bay twice... first time... the Arizona sun faded and ripped it to shreds in about a year and half.... I thought well... maybe it would not be so bad the next time and I purchased another one just thinking it was my bad luck it didn't last the first time. This second time... it didn't even make it a year before it was shredded to tiny bits hanging on all sides on the ground, dangling by a few seams...If you live in Arizona or another sunny climate I would warn you to not waste your money. This cover cannot handle the sun. I wish I had bought something better. Now I am trying to find a new cover to buy that will last longer this time."
3,I was thinking of the Other Nashville....,"Listenable, but not quite what I was expecting....(dog-gone those expectations, they be little more than ""future resentments""). I have it in the pickup for those long drives, so I am getting some enjoyment out of it."
3,"A Great Casta Diva, A SMILING Adalgisa, and NO Subtitles","Caballe sings a great Casta Diva here, but after that she has trouble with her highest notes. Either they are harsh and shrill or she simply doesn't sing them at all and sings a lower note instead. Except for her Casta Diva, she sings better in the 1974 video. Another thing is that Josephine Veasey in the 1974 video is a far better Adalgisa than the constantly smiling, applause-milking, edgy-voiced Cossotto in the 1978 video. Ivo Vinco has the bass voice of a God, but his part is too small to redeem his wife's constantly smiling (showing all her teeth, even while singing) Adalgisa. The 1974 NORMA recording has it's problems too, mostly the wind, but it is definitely preferably to this 1978 recording. And besides, the 1974 recording has subtitles, which the 1978 recording does not."
4,Profound Education Theory,"As a person who is concerned about the fate of the world, this book was of considerable interest to me. Neil Postman discusses the ramifications of various education theories, and of what benefit they may be to future generations.He explains his theories carefully and in the friendly style I have come to expect. He draws many of his lessons from our greatest teacher, History.However, this is not a book for classroom teachers, because it addresses the underpinnings, not the practices of teaching. To fully implement his ideas would require the power of an administrator or a superintendant, not a teacher.Nevertheless, it is an ambitious and noteworthy book for anyone interested in the way we shape future generations."
2,Disapointed,"Well I did get it ontime so I give that five stars but other than that the candy bars tasted old so I tried looking at the date and it was scrashed off, so I'm dissapointed."
5,Love this choker!,"Awesome choker...soft against the neck, yet perfect balance of leather and lace. Fit perfectly and looked even better!"
4,Still growing with every listen,"Currently one of my most played CDs. I was disappointed by My True Name and initially felt this one was average but it just keeps getting better. Carrie's voice is rich and expressive, instrumentally the playing is strong and tasteful and the song arrangements are superb. Some of the songs are her strongest ever - the uptempo Tornado Alley, All I Know, When It's Gone and the brilliant Just Like Downtown are great band tracks while the quieter ballads, Bare to the Bone, This Too Will Pass, Sparrow and my favourite, Thread are gorgeous. Some nice new sounds - the vibes on Seven Dreams are excellent. If I have any criticism, I would have liked a few more lead melody instruments standing out - fiddle, accordion, mandolin (as feature on Visions and Dreams) and I still think she needs to work on lyrics - sometimes they're too self indulgent. I would give this 4 and a half stars if that was possible. It is an excellent collection."
4,"Carrie is great, as usual","Carrie's albums are never-fail great, but I admit that I like her newer work more."
2,Non-Christians look elsewhere,"I picked this book up at a bookstore, and after flipping through it, found it interesting enough to buy. I checked the author info for his creds: hmmm, clinical psychotherapist, best-selling author, seminar producer. Okay, sounds good. So I was really disappointed to get into the book and find so many references to Scripture and the Christian faith. I wish the religious slant had been mentioned on the book jacket so those of us who do not share the author's beliefs would be able to make a better decision. No offense to the guy, you know, good for him being a Christian. But if I wanted to be preached at I'd go to church.Having said that, I did my best to read around the Bible references, and found some good insights and ideas. I'm still kinda miffed about the whole thing, though. Miffed enough to write my first review on Amazon."
1,Offensive,"I picked up Bill Beausay's book for advice about my teenage son. When I came upon a pagargraph on page 124 that I found extremely offensive, I could read no further: ""Growing up is all about learning autonomy -- and that means a lot of messes. Even God had to suffer through it with His children, the Jews (and He was the perfect parent)."""
4,Truth in fiction,"I love that Karen writes about real life, real pain, real sorrow. Rejoice explains how as Christians we are not free from pain in life, but have a loving Savior who walks with us through the pain."
5,Awesome series,Karen Kingsbury is one of my favorite authors. Rejoice is a very good book.I love reading all of her books.
5,A must read!,"This is one of the amazing books in the Redemption series, which is a definite must read. I love the story line and have defiantly learned many things by reading these books. I gave this book a five star rating. Once you start reading, you won't be able to put it down."
5,Redemption Series,"The Redemption, Firstborn & Sunrise Series books are the best series of books I have ever read!!! They have blessed & inspired me immensely. Thanks for the opportunity to say so. :-)"
5,redemption series,loved the whole series. Am on the last book of this series before i move on to the next Baxter series. Books left me in tears.
5,Wonderful book,"As with all the books in this series, the story is a God filled family story with happy and sad moments but with a lesson about God's love."
5,Amazing Series,"I love this series, I have given it to all my friends, or in this case bought it for a friend!"
5,works great!,"I was a little skeptical when I ordered it, but I really wanted to try something with fewer chemicals.After 2 years of use, including a lot of time in a hot tropical climate, I have to say it works great! I will definately purchase this again."
4,It does prevent odor. But does it contain aluminum?,"I've been using the Crystal Stick for over 2 years, and have been happy with its ability to control odor without aluminum or pour clogging. However, I recently noticed that one of the ingredients is ammonium alum. An article I found says this is just another form of aluminum, while the company told me that it's a mineral salt that does not block pours. I'm no chemist, but I wonder why the packaging says ""NO Aluminum Chlorohydrate"" and not just ""NO Aluminum"". This doubt has led me to make my own deodorant by mixing natural baking soda (NOT baking powder, which contains aluminum) with just enough organic coconut oil (available on Amazon) to make a paste that I can rub on my underarms after taking a shower. This simple combination of baking soda (deodorizer) and coconut oil (antimicrobial) has worked as well as the Crystal Stick for me (no odor for 24-48 hours). I still occasionally use Crystal Stick for convenience (e.g. while traveling)."
5,Amazing,"I did not think it would work. I have tried many ""natural"" deodorants and my the time I get home from work the smell was always bad. I have been using for three weeks now and I am amazed at how well it works. Even on a hot day that we were moving, I finished the day with out a smell. You will still sweat (which your supposed to do) but at the end of the day there is no bad odor."
2,Somewhat dated and corny,"I rented this DVD because I love birds of prey and though David Attenborough's otherwise excellentThe Life of Birdsdidn't do them justice. However,World of Raptorsdoesn't either. The film is only 14 years old, but feels much older. It has a cheesy soundtrack and corny narration. The documentary begins with a birder telling his grandson about bird-watching (replete with ""golly, gee"" dialogue). I'm so glad wildlife documentaries have developed better filming techniques and cinematography since this one came out. It's too bad nobody has done a more recent take on raptors."
5,Hush Puppies walkers,These Hush Puppies Walker's have been a favorite of mine for 20+ years and they are just as comfortable today as in years past. They are comfortable and wear well.
1,shoes is so hard,shoes is so hard'and very uncomfortable'it dispoint my expectation'i feel so sad to Hush Puppies shoes''''''
5,mall walker,"I started wearing the Hush Puppies Mall Walker for work, close to 10 years ago.I'm on my feet 9-10 hours a day, 5 days a week and after years of sore feet and shoes not lasting more than six months at most, I stumbled upon the Mall Walker.This shoe is super comfortable right out of the box. There is no break in period while the shoe forms to your foot. The welt is sewn which is a necessity for me.Because I'm on my feet so much, they sweat a lot and the glued shoes break down in just a few months.The soles offer great traction and cushion and always last me at least a full year. Considering the miles I put on them, I can't ask for more.In addition, they are fairly stylish and look respectable with dress pants, shirt and tie and a breeze to keep shined. Don't ever stop making these! Well, until I can retire anyway."
5,good as advertised,This is a very comfortable shoe. Not stiff and lighter weight than it would appear. I purchased a wide width and it fit very nicely.
5,Great confortable shoes,My husband has been wearing these Mall Walker shoes for at least 19 years. He will only buy this brand as he says they keep his feet well supported. He is about 40 pounds overweight and they really hep.
2,Nice but unconfortable,"These shoes don't fit well, maybe are bad sized, they are tigth and hurt my feet, I have been using this brand for four years and this model is not as good as other ones, I recommend going to a shoe store and try them on before buying."
4,Awesome Mall Walkers,"Purchased these shoes for my husband as his work shoes. He wears them all the time..... absoutely LOVES them. Very comfortable, Real Leather."
3,Not nearly as comfortable as SAS equivalent shoes,"From the description and prior reviews, I was expecting a supportive, comfortable shoe of modest weight. My current preferred shoe of this type is the S.A.S shoe (""Bout Time model) that sells for twice or more the price. But it wears very well and is comfortable out of the box, which is to say it supports the foot well, and is moderately light weight. The uppers on the Hush Puppy shoes look nice, but the sole has a much larger outline than the shoe itself, which is to say, the edge noticeably sticks out. The shoe is quite heavy (compared to SAS and others). The inner support doesn't support my feet as well (less arch support). And, my foot move around in the shoe even though the size seems correct in terms of toe placement. I'll likely send them back."
3,Not your faithful Hush Puppies,"This shoe ran big and I needed a half size smaller and a D width rather than a wide. The ad states the shoe has a soft crepe type sole but it came with a hard synthetic sole. It was not very flexible and it's been my experience that if a shoe needs much 'breaking in', it won't be very comfortable."
1,Be VERY wary of sizing,Ordered my usual shoe size. This shoe appears to be at least a full size longer and 2 widths wider than other shoes I have. Will be returning.
1,No drive shipped in the box.,I received the sealed box and there was a nice metal case with a back up button...but no drive. I had to return it.
3,Flexible but not heat tolerant,At first I was very impressed with how much more pliable the cable was as opposed to some other 10 gauge wire I purchased previously. It didn't take long however to discover the disadvantage of the flexible insulation surrounding the wire. Under medium load the wire on this insulation split and melted quickly where as my other wire with stiffer insulation was unscathed.So its easy to bend and use but beware as it will split and melt easier.
5,It works great,"I dont know why every one complains this isn't awg 10 wire, it is.I compared the size to boss awg 10 and the only difference is the size of the rubber jacket, Boss had more rubber making it seem like a larger wire but both conductors are appropriate size for awg 10.so I think its great! when used properly.The wire will provide minimal line loss when used in appropriate lengths for power needs.the shielding is thick enough to avoid hum and other interference.so save yourself so $$$ and use it.You must note that I have found with almost all mid end and low end cable it is not true copper, but copper tinned metal, I think its aluminum you'll know when you cut it. Like i stated above as long as you don't exceed length and power needs the line loss is negligible.bottom line, use it your wallet will thank you."
4,Good product,Love this product served with sliced cheddar cheese. Delivery is not efficient though. They came in batches. I was also forced to buy 4 pieces to complete my order but I don't really mind it cause I love this product.
5,Exceeded Expectation,"Wonderful Product. This product was more than I expected. The contents will be very useful in the educational setting in which I plan to use them. The stamps were big, up to 1"",much better than some other kits I have found. We will be able to use the stamps with children of varies ages because of the size. The book is helpful and informative. Wonderful product."
3,ok...overpriced!,"The stamps look ok. The stampers are large and rubber. For the money I was expecting wood backing like the high quality melissa and doug stamps, however these have a foam backing, which means they won't last as long. The little companion book is nice. I think they should list wood or foam backing!"
5,Heiroglyphics Made Easy,Order this set if you'd like an easy way to print in Egyptian Hieroglyphs. It comes with a small stamp pad and a helpful informational pamphlet which gives background information about the meaning behind the symbols. The stamp set contains stamps for all basic sounds.
5,Magnificent - a must for sailors and wannabees alike,"Magnificent - a must for sailors and wannabees alike.The Pardeys are out there doing it, and have been since i was a young-un. There advice has been right on the money so often that i'd follow it blindly."
2,Overblown Arguements,"A New Reformation - the title spoke to me about a change in heart and mind. This change needs to be much nuanced in order to include all. Matthew Fox attempts to do this. The kernel of his message is right on target. We need to look beyond the status quo to experience the sacred love that was lived by Jesus the Christ and taught by Paul. Unfortunately, Fox goes off the deep end with this kernel, reminding me of a Michael Moore movie. The papacy and the fundamentalists are not all wrong. Their message is nuanced and worth understanding rather than belittling as irrelevant. Although I agree with Fox's hypothesis, I have real problems with his methods."
1,Piece of junk!!!,Don't buy this saw!! I just spent three hours cutting down two twenty foot trees. The chain tension knob is made out of plastic and stripped out before I had dropped the first tree. The chain popped off the bar five times which damaged the chain and housing. I had to dismantle the tension housing and turn the inside gears by hand to get the chain tightened. After a few cuts the chain loosens up again. This thing is dangerous and should be recalled!!
1,Chain does not stay on.,"I have other chain saws (McCulloch) but this one can not keep the chain on it. Within 5 minutes of use it threw the chain. The drive (inside) side of the chain gets damaged when it comes off. Had to file the inside (drive) edges to reinstall the chain. Never runs for 10 minutes without throwing the chain. The saw was unusable and I returned it to a dealer. He swapped it for another new one. The new one works far better, but not as good as it should. I only throw a chain once an hour.If you buy it and it starts throwing chains, take it back. And keep taking it back until it stops throwing chains.If you have not yet bought it, DON'T. Pick something else."
1,bad saw terrible service,As was stated by someone else the chain tightener is terrible. If you try to return the saw unused they won't take it back. Bad saw bad service.
2,"Pay cheap, get cheap.",It's better to approach this saw with low expectations. The first thing you notice is that the body is all plastic. As noted elsewhere even the tightening knob is plastic. I've gone through one knob in a few months and bought two spares. The bar clamp doesn't lock the bar down so the chain flies off easily. DON'T take the bar off because lining up the lug with the hole is a challenge. The air filter is an expensive but flimsy plastic-and-gauze assembly that loads up quickly and tears. Even if the filter isn't torn dirt gets through the rinky-dink gasket under it.But what do you expect when you pay under $200 for a 20-inch saw? I'm shopping for a better saw. I'll keep this one for emergencies.
5,This is a great chain saw,"1. Cheaper here (i.e., $179) than at Lowes ($198).2. The Quick-Adjustment knob works fine. You simply stop the saw, loosen the round knob 1.5 turns, spin the tension adjuster (below the bar tension knob), then re-tighten the bar tension knob.3. Back to work.4. No need to carry a bar wrench tool around while working.5. Engine seems powerful enough and the single-point tension device satisfactorily holds the bar tight for the job.6. Chain bar length is long enough to take care of any typical tree job.I highly recommend this chain saw. I went through nearly every ""consumer grade"" model on the market (literally bought and returned them) before I finally found this quite satisfactory chain saw.My only recommendation to novice users is to purchase a face guard / helmet / ear muffs (all-in-one product) and wear gloves all the time."
3,You get what you pay for,"This saw is ok for the money but certainly not what one would call a ""Good"" chain saw. Lots of pastic parts that wear out quickly and very tempermental in use."
1,stay clear of the plastic tensioner,"this chainsaw, starts, runs, and cuts good. however the plastic tensioner loosened and came off with just the normalvibration of cutting for 20 minutes, the chain came off the bar and almost got me,. i called poulan cust service and was told to see a autherized service center to see if i caused the issue, if it was a defective part they would fix the plastic.if i wanted to get the conversion kit, then i would have to pay for it.i don't feel i should have to pay for my own safety, this is obviously a poulan design flaw."
2,Good saw but one major negative,Just bought this saw today am returning it tomorrow. After several hours of cutting I've decided that it is a nice saw for someone cutting a few branches on occasion but for someone who cuts logs into firewood length on a consistent basis it has one major problem. The chain adjustment device just does not work. Over about 4 hours I had to tighten the chain over 20 times and the chain jumped off the bar 3 times. Very dangerous!!! I've had many chainsaws over the last 30 years and this is absolutely the worst chain tensioning system I've ever used. No matter how tight you turn the big knob it goes out of adjustment quickly.I also noticed that for a 46cc engine it seems to be light on power for a 20 inch saw. It does the job but when cutting a log 16-18 inches in dia. it bogs down alot.
2,Why change it,"The saw is of medium grade. Maybe even a little light on the power for larger trees. The chain adjusting system works OK, but the knob to tighten the bar is just not sufficent for extened use. I used a Dremel to router out the cover so I could use a second nut on the other stud. I now use a nut on both studs, like every other saw I've owned, and this eliminates the bar movement that causes the chain to loosen up. Just another example of trying to build a better mouse trap that doesn't work. The design guy should try another line of work."
3,wood eat'n machine,Chain came off a couple of times when I first started using it but after I got it tensioned and stretched worked like a charm.
2,You get what you pay for...,"Poulan saws are cheap, and the quality reflects that.http://racesaws.com/index.php?referrerid=1839The chain oil pump gear is nylon, and prone to stripping.Parts are inexpensive, and available - but do you have time and knowledge to repair things like oil pumps and anti vibe springs.I'll spend more and get a Stihl or Husqvarna from now on."
5,Wonderful Find!,"This book was absolutly amazing. I am very interested in the Civil War, and only knew some basic facts about Fort Delaware. I have visited the fort, which is open to the public as a Delaware State Park, and was amazed. I met Mr. Fetzer and he is an incredible man, as are the rest of the reenactors there. The book is an extension of the knowledge I recieved during my visit. The way the book was orginized was ingenious. I am amazed at all the fascinating things that went on at Fort Delaware, as I am with the different kinds of relationships and personalities the officers had. The island became a city, and it is amazing to me the circumstances which the people on Pea Patch Island during the Civil War had to deal with and the events that occured. This is an absolutly wonderful book. I read it several weeks ago and have since reread it several times. I have reccomended it to my own friends. I am sure you will enjoy this book as I have. My complements to Mr. Fetzer as well as Mr. Mowday."
5,Unlikly allies- where history lives on today,"I read the book unlikly allies,which i thought was very well written by Herr Fetzer. He truly has written a book, that is perfect for anyone who asks ""Can you tell me about Fort Delaware"" This book does tell you basically everything you want to know about fort delaware and what went on with the people who lived their lives on that island. this book should be number 1!"
5,Excellent Quality Wall Lamps,I had lamps that stood on my nightstand and they took up so much room. I now have a CPAP and did not have room for the table lamps so these wall lamps were perfect & Look nicer than the photo on Amazons web site
2,Had to make alterations to installation,"Once I got them installed they looked great, but total frustration during installation. The screws from the mounting plate that come through the base are not long enough to attach the small colored nuts to secure the lamp to the wall. I had to put a spacer behind the mounting plate in order to get the screws to stick out far enough to allow the small colored nuts to catch the threads. I can't believe nobody else has had this problem."
1,Not as people say,"After reviewing everyones opinion on this seat, i bought it and tried it on for a 44 mile ride, i barely made it back because of the horrible pain i was in. My rear end, ladies you all know what i am talking about. I am thin and in shape, this seat is no better than the rest. Next time i am going to a real bike shop to really try one on before purchasing."
5,Have used it for years,Love it! Just hard to find. Not sticky or heavy. I got the large size and thought it had a pump like the picture showed but no pump just regular cap. Glad I saved the old pump.
2,Works well; offensive odor,"Second purchase of this product for wife. Evidently, the formulation has changed. Still does its job, but now stinks to high heaven. Not buying any more."
5,Karen Kingsbury/ Redemption series,We bought the Karen Kingsbury Redemption series for my mother-in-law after hearing how great they were. She has a hard time putting them down and plans to buy the next two series. Trust me!!! Linda I
4,Great Conclusion,"This book is the fifth book in Karen Kingsbury's Redemption Series. The author brings us full circle showing us how the Baxter family has become so strong. We learn of the trials Elizabeth and John went through before they started their family and what they must go through as they endure reprecussions from those choices. This is a book about love, loss and reunion as the family turns to the Lord in all that they face."
5,Excellent!,If you've never read Karen Kingsbury this is the book to start with. She is an excellent storyteller. You will be enthralled and sucked into the story. These characters become like real people simply because they are so real!
5,Reunion,Awesome read can't wait for the next series. Highly recommend this and I have serveral times already.
5,"Love, Love, Love this book","Everytime that I read a Karen Kingsbury book I cry. Never be without a box of tissues when you read her books. I love getting to know the characters it makes the books so much easier to read, which is why I like Karen Kingsbury so much. She is a very good story teller and makes everything seem so real. Great book and I can't wait for the First Born Series!!!"
5,Karen Kingsbury is my favorite author!,There isn't a book she has written that I have not read for good reason! She is such a gifted author and I often find myself laughing and crying within the same page. I am always anxiously awaiting her next book. Enjoy it!!
2,Pretty much what you expect,I was recommended this series by a friend. I was given the first 4 books and then had to purchase the 5th. This whole series is so ridiculous. I do not relate to these people whom Kingsbury writes about. I know she has a great following but it just isn't for me.This book itself seemed a little disjointed from the others in the series and seemed like such a strange and unbelievable backstory for the parents.
5,A very touching book,"I got this book about a month ago when I 1st moved to Hollywood. As a kid I remember sitting around during the holidays and listening to all of the women in my family tell stories of the past. To me this book is like the stories that my mother and grandmother used to tell. The stories in this book are great stories that make you think, make you happy and make you proud to be a Jewish person living in this world."
4,Quite uplifting.,"I read this book at a rather appropriate time, seeing as I'm writing my thesis regarding the treatment of Jews in post World War II Los Angeles this coming semester. I found the stories sweet and uplifting, or moving and intriguing. It's a quick read, and an enjoyable one. Some stories were a bit schmaltzy, a little too saccharine, but for the most part they were quite good."
4,Book with Heart,"The ""Chicken Soup For The... "" series are all a pleasure to read. This one does in fact speak to the heart, a refreshing chance for me to get away from the thriller fiction books attracting me and then often disappointing, leaving me with the thought, ""Is that all there is? Obviously, the stories are about Jewish people, but they might just as well be about any people thrown into the same circumstance. And they all appeal to what's best in all of us. Read it."
4,Fine little heater...,"I bought it when it went on sale, as it was then much cheaper than the utility heaters I could find in stores near me. I'm happy with it, although sometimes I wish it was a little 'beefier'. My old more utilitarian one had better airflow and seemed to heat the room quicker, but I think it was noisier in the tradeoff. The DeLonghi is quiet and looks nice, the controls are easy to use, and the whole thing has a nice 'feel' to it. If it forced more air through it would have been a 5 star rating easily."
1,"no stars, useless","Read the negative reviews for this product (I refuse to refer to it as a heater)....Those negative reviews are accurate. I can't believe Delonghi put their name on this. I also had the misfortune of ordering this through Amazon but had it sold by Beach Camera.....that means I got charged $10 by UPS to ship it back, Amazon should be ashamed."
1,my dog blows hotter breath,I ordered this heater because it was such a good deal. I own many electric heaters to give out to renters for emergency heat. I have never owned a heater this useless. It would not heat a 5 x 5 bath after running a couple of hours.
1,enema,This is not practical to use. I am ending up buying disposable Fleet enema and emptying the saline solution for use instead of the Cara syringe.
5,"Excellent, Giftable Book","I recently bought and gave this book to a dear friend who has a talent for written expression. It's an excellent, giftable book with many tips, thoughts to ponder and loads of encouragement for aspiring writers. Buy it for yourself if you'd love to put your own experiences or thoughts on paper and you need a bit of direction... or consider tucking it into a holiday gift stash if you know someone who has a way with words. There's a lot of bang for the buck in this book. It's well worth Amazon's affordable price."
4,Thoughtful and inspiring.,"The purpose of this book is to approach your writing by accessing the keys to hidden creativity. Through thoughtful essays, the author reveals spiritual insights based upon a lifetime of writing and facilitating workshops. Whether writing in a journal or for publication, Writing from the Heart will land in yours."
1,circuot,hi i would like to tell you about the movie but the company canceled it on me for reasons i dont understand but seen the movie its great and i did order it from a new company and waiting you wont go wronge with this movie
3,"Cant review it,,,never got it,,,,","Seller sent me the wrong movie and by that time I lost interst in trying to see it,,,,,,"
4,Delicious!!!,"Circuit is a deliciously addicting venture into the gay circuit party culture. It offers a fascinating glimpse into the life of a former police officer who is outed and must relocate to LA, since it is 'more suitable to his lifestyle.' Of course, our hottie falls into the circuit and quickly spirals out of control.An intriguing premise, soap opera storylines, and a fabulous cast which includes small roles by William Katt and Nancy Allen, in a ""Carrie"" reunion, and lots of fun cameos, all make Circuit worthwhile. Of course the beautiful 'eye candy' and well-done sex scenes don't hurt either. Circuit is strictly guilty pleasure, but what pleasure it is!"
2,Soft Core Afterschool Special,"A small town gay cop leaves Indiana for WeHo and ends up leading the debauched lifestyle of a ""circuit boy."" Interesting storyline, solid message and some okay performances are all marred by the unnecessary inclusion of artsy, overlong, softcore-style sex scenes (a la Queer as Folk) which distract from the plot and generally cheapen the proceedings. Despite the gratuitous, cheesy sex, a number of extraneous sub-plots and a corny ABC afterschool special ending, it's still marginally diverting.Two and half stars."
2,Stereotype of gay life.,"Is so boring that all this gay movies are always about Great looking guys who do nothing . but party 24/7 and when they portrait their lives is always the same , clubs, drugs, promiscuity and of curse they all look perfect face and body,.Please,.show some real acting,.gay men are also professionals and most of them don't do drugs,.there was not much story to follow, was all about this guys partying and having sex..Not a movie that deserves to be part of a collection."
3,Good film! (besides the acting),The acting was poor but the film's message was profound and thought provoking. Always a plus is the beautiful well-built leading man along with an excellent excellent sex scene! I'd rent it just for that!
3,"Decent, but not the best","The acting in this flick is certainly better than in a lot of gay movies, but the story is pretty lame and one dimensional. A small town cop is gay, we get nothing of a back story on the guy to help us understand where he is with his situation, he just gets the idea to move to L.A."
1,Terrible Movie -- Demeaning to the Gay Community,"I am amazed how this film can actually be acknowledged as a favorable film. Everywhere in the mainstream gay periodicals, this film is being promulgated as a forefront feature worthy of its merits. I think not. ""Circuit"" is nothing more than a celebration of drugs, narcissicism, shallowness, deceit, and everything wrong with circuit parties.What was Dirk Schafer thinking? Obviously he wasn't when he decided to produce and direct this piece of substance-free (there's an oxy-moron for you) garbage showcasing a group of characters with nothing more in their lives than meaningless partying, drug-taking, and prwoling colorful circuit parties to quench their insatible appetites for sexual conquest. This shallow film, ..., only lends to projecting a negative and demeaning image of the gay community...""Circuit"" is simply a deplorable feature with awful sound, music, characters, story, and direction!"
4,So True -- From a Circuit Boy,"The reviews for the movie, state that its terrible and projects the wrong image for the gay community. The truth is the circuit community is a LARGE part of the gay community, at least the gay male community. The images shown in Circuit as by and large truthful and unvarnished. Thousands upon Thousands of gay boys flock the parties all over the country. And while Circuit may show an extreme version of the events, they are nevertheless valid and accurate. I have literally seen people drop dead next to me from overdose of GHB and the other boys look and then keep dancing. The extensive 'partying' that surrounds those events is sad but its a fact that can not be overlooked not matter how much we might wish it to be otherwise.This film should be taken for what it is a non-judgmental honest portrait of the circuit party lifestyle. Its not for everyone but its factual and true to life. Its part of our culture and we should not be afraid or ashamed of it."
4,Comfortable,"They are very comfortable, and also hide my bunion well. However, I wish there could be more room at the instep part: I bought a pair in wide for my mom, but her insteps were too high to fit in, so I had to keep it myself."
4,Sudinin shoes,Shoes are very stilish and comfortable. Do not weare well. After couple of days start looking worn. Not a very good quality product.
3,"Beautiful photos, unreadable calendar","I would give this calendar five stars -- except that I can't read it! It's a wall calendar, yet the days and dates are set in mice-type (small fonts)that I can't see from three feet away. This problem is compounded by the pale ink colors used. I have had to go through the whole calendar and write in the days and dates in black letters. What a shame. Now my pretty calendar is all ugly, but at least I know what day it is. I hope they will make it more readable and useful for next year."
3,Two sides to every story,"This is a lovely coffee table book, celebrating feline beauty in many forms, set in the incomparable beauty of Greece. Hans Silvester's photographs are captivating but only tell part of the story of Greece's cats. They are an integral part of Greece's landscape but their lives are not always beautiful. They are also tales of neglect, disease and cruelty. Anybody who photographs Greece's cats for profit should maybe consider donating some proceeds to their welfare. As much as I enjoyed looking at the photographs, I was uncomfortably aware of the other side of the story, having lived in the region for many years. The book was censorship - a bit like going to Ethiopia and only taking pictures of well-fed children."
5,Hans Silvester's Cats in the Sun,"Hans Silvester captures not just cats, but the Mediterranean ambience in these gorgeous photos. His years spent photographing and learning about these felines are apparent. The color and composition of his photos is amazing. He has chosen to show us the real cats...not some cute, little, studio-posed furball. These are cats in their natural habitat going about their daily routines. This is a must have for cat lovers."
3,Good and useful book,"Since `our habits determine our future' a lot of self-help revolves around changing our habits (not so easily done.) I like this particular book because it doesn't present NLP as an easy fix but instead they take quite a bit of space to explain how we think and act in habits and patterns. The authors then offer NLP techniques to help change your patterns until you develop new habits. As in all self-help there's not really much new here and anyone who has read Tony Robbins will be familiar with most of the concepts presented. It's a good book, though, and very useful for understanding the development of habits and cycles. I recommend it as a more objective presentation of NLP without all the fire walking hoopla."
5,Hard to put down and one of the best books on NLP!,"In my 20+ years as a Hypnotherapist, I've read quite a lot of books on NLP and by far this is the best ""How-to"" book that breaks down the NLP component tools into easy to understand and apply bite sized chunks!The book is very well organized as a reference text as well for all you coaches out there that need a quick brief of some particular aspect of NLP!I highly recommend this book!:DMike - C.Ht"
4,Best tools for healthy thinking and living,"I have been through numerous coaching programs and have read numerous coaching books. I found this book to provide one of the most straightforward, logical and easy to implement tools for healthy thinking and living. It also made me realize how most coaching programs have NLP as their fundamental core - they're just putting their own spin to it."
4,Excellent overview,"This book does an excellent job of teaching you to identify the plot, character, setting, point of view, etc. The analysis of the story Young Goodman Brown and the study questions for each chapter gave me all the information I needed to be able to teach this to my children. Recommended."
5,Best book on Ruby and Sapphire.,"Ruby and Sapphire by Robert Hughes is the best book written on the subject, for its clarity,research and most importantly its human face of the author. It shows his love and personal conection with the corundum family."
5,Disneywish,The 6 dvd's where wonderful. I always wanted to take my family there. These dvd's make us feel that we are there.
3,"Disney Parks: The Secrets, Stories and Magic Behind the scenes",I had already saw most of this information on Modern Marvels. This did not add much to it. A little disappointed after paying over $21 for this. I expected more and got less.
3,Questionable Disney DVD,"This item offers little to no more information than the specials on Travel Channels ""Season of Disney"". In fact, it almost is an extended version of it. I learned nothing new that I didn't already know and it's a little outdated..."
5,To remember...,"Is's a fantastic display of Disneylad and Disneyworld attractions. If you've never visited it, you will enjoy the information, tips and insiders info. If you've already been there, it's wonderful to remember! In the DVD there are three titles:1) Disneyland Resorts: Behind the scenes, where they give a very close look of some of its best attractions. Imagineers and creators comment and explain attractions;2) Ultimate Walt Disney World, where the same happens;3) Undiscovered Disney Parks, where they give tips of (I wouldn't say) ""unknown"" or little known attractions, like driving a Nascar race car or being escorted on a visit. Mostly they are the VIP tours, i.e., the very expensive tours...I didn't regret, and I've imported it from Brazil. I recommend it.Hugs,Arena."
4,Disney Parks,A great look at WDW and a much better planning video as compared to the official free dvd that you can get on the disney world website. This blu ray shows you the most popular attractions including clips from on the rides rather than the promotional clips the official dvd. I recommend this one for anyone looking to get a better look at the attractions walt disney world.
3,Misleading,"I just returned from a trip from Walt Disney World in Florida & bought this with the expectations of seeing more of Walt Disney World but the video is mostly about Disneyland in California. The smaller portion of the video is about the more adult/extreme rides only from Walt Disney World & not much else about the parks there. Not to mention this portion was already aired on the Travel Channel & I already had seen it. If you are more of a Disneyland parks fan, this video is for you. Most of the 'secrets' in the video are from the California park. The best part of this video is finally getting to see Club 33, Walt's personal apartment & the suite in the top of Cinderella's Castle in Walt Disney World. These are things MOST visitors don't get to see. I'd recommend another video if you are looking for a keepsake of the current version of Walt Disney World."
3,one long running disney commercial!,"this is simply one long running walt disney world commercial. it is interesting, but not all that imformative. it will probably not tell anything you dont already know. unless you have never been to disney world of course. it is very well done, for a 6 hour commercial that is."
4,Very Informative!,"This DVD pack is really great to those who are planning their first Disney vacation. It provides a lot of insight to what is available for families to do including at Disneyland, Disney World, and Disney Cruises. It also previews some of the more popular rides without giving too much away.I bought this for my wife who has been to Disney World more times that I can count on my fingers love this DVD pack. She really likes the cruise DVD as it gives you a very in-depth view of what Disney cruises is all about. One of the thing that we found from the DVD is that on the Disney Cruises, there are different areas for kids ranging from 1 to 100...some areas are teens only while others are for families and then there are adults only places."
2,So So,"It think it's better for kids, or people that are not familiar with DL. I go to DL often, and there isn't much here that I didn't know already. Young kids might enjoy this. I probably won't watch it a second time."
2,Good but lacking content,"I purchased the blu-ray version of this series as I enjoy the HD versions and it came with the DVD & digital versions. I was greatly disappointed to find some of the Disney Park specials were removed from the Blu-ray version and the quality of the product is greatly lacking. Upon opening I first thought I may have received a pirated copy as I found it hard to believe everything fit on 1 blu-ray. On top of that, the digital copies are not set up like most digital copies as you have to copy them to your HD. If you want to put them on your iPod or iPad you will have to convert them in iTunes. A google search did show the item is legit and just had a poor design & make.Overall I still enjoy the series but would not recommend buying the blu-ray version."
3,nice,"Maybe it will be even better without too many interviews / talking. I bought this videos for my 7-year old daughter and she doesn't seem interested. She expected seeing more insights on characters, rides and shows."
2,a long commercial for disneyland,"this is just a video about the parks of Disneyland Resort. You can get this free if you order it through the actual Disney site, just ask for the vacation planning video or dvd to be sent to you, its free!!!! you dont even have to pay for the shipping and handling, Disney pays for the shipping! I love DISNEY!!!!! If this was a Disney product i would tell you to buy it, but its some random company trying to make a quick buck on Disney."
3,"It,s ok",I RECENTLY PURCHASE THE DISNEY PARKS (THE SECRET STORIES AND MAGIC BEHIND THE SCENES)WAS REALLY EXCITED WHAT THEY WOULD SHOW.SAW THE FIRST DVD AND WAS OK BUT SEEN MOST OF THE BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE RIDES FROM OTHER DOCUMENTARIES ABOUT DISNEY SO THAT DISAPPOINTED ME AND AS I WAS GOING THROUGH THE REST OF THE SET IT WAS REPEATING SOME OF THE STUFF FROM THE PREVIOUS DVDS SO I RECOMMEND JUST GETTING THE UNDISCOVER DISNEY PARKS AS THAT WILL HAVE MOST OF THE DOCUMENTARY OF THE PARKS.WOULD HAVE EXPECT MORE NEW ITEMS THAT HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE.
1,Ineffectual,"Did not brown meat at all. Was not effective on any use. Tried to return it by mailing it back. Was told I couldn't return it, I needed to pay for postage to send it back to me. I told them to keep it, I did not plan to throw good money after bad."
3,Jesus And Mastership,"Readers of ""A Course in Miracles"" may have a hard time believing the source of that book and the source of this book to be one and the same.The three star rating was given simply to convey neutrality."
1,Jesus and Mastership: The gospel according to Jesus of Nasareth,"I thought this book is a SHAM: both in product quality and content.Firstly, the cover began coming off in the first hour of reading and I did not treat this book as roughly as most of the books I read, being careful to not bend the spine of this book.Secondly, the story, in my opinion varied little with what is recorded in the Bible and is a far cry from ""A Course in Miracles"" and its newer corollary ""The Disappearance of the Universe"".I was so incensed with the book, I thought I would burn it to keep this drivel from further exposure to an unsuspecting readership. (so rating this product as one star is far too high. )I very much do appreciate Amazon and it services.I do look forward to buying more books in the future."
3,Friends can help or hurt!,"Ms. Isaacs didn't cover something very important: the friends don't have to be yours to help or hurt!When I was younger, an ex boyfriend harrased me for about two years. He denied my accusations to his best friend, so when I saw the guy, he made it clear his friend wouldn't go that far. After I saw my ex's best friend, he didn't bother me anymore. What I figured is he didn't want the risk of his best friend finding out the truth.I had parted ways with a guy who was less than honest with me. One of his ""friends"" chose to meddle and made things much worse.And those are just two examples!In both cases, the friends of someone I'd had trouble with helped me get rid of them permanently."
5,I have never laughed so hard,"This is by far the funniest and most clever reality television show. You will most probably find it is a great entertainment value. This season has the perfect ""Schmo"" and I would recommend it highly. However, I would avoid season 2. This was difficult to recreate and adapt to the two ""Schmo's"" in the follow-up attempt.Buy this season. You would not regret it and will enjoy watching it again in the future."
3,Joe Schmo...What is going on?,"I remember watching this show years ago and laughing my butt off. I looked around here and there but never came upon it in the stores that I frequented. A drunk discussion with my friends turned to me checking amazon.com and making an impulse buy. I didn't regret it. It was still as hilarious as the first time I watched it, and caught a few things that caught my glance the first time. Even if you are not a fan of reality shows you will be able to find some humor in it. I recommend it."
2,"Well, Well","I got a disc of The Joe Scshmo Show marked ""For voting at Emmy Award"" which was a mere story of creating this thing, and what I was watching at did not attract me yet: Big Brother with one real participant getting a win at the end."
3,Not So Uncensored After All,"Once again (see my previous review for Best of Insomniac Vol.2) a DVD touted as ""uncensored"" turns out to be partially censored. During the wet t-shirt competition, the actress portraying Molly climbs out of the pool. Her bikini top slips and reveals her nipple. It's blurred out!! Now, call me crazy, but that would seem to be an instance of censoring. I'm sure that they simply could not get clearance from the actress to show her assets, but then they shouldn't claim that the program is uncensored when it clearly is not.The show itself is very entertaining and worth viewing, but, c'mon people, let's be a little more truthful about the contents."
4,Outstanding,"This tour-de-force told the story of an Ethiopian Jew who was ushered to Israel only to be discriminated against just as he did in Ethiopia. It all came down to the colour of the skin. In Ethiopia, he's regarded as an outsider and in Israel, just like his counterparts, he's been branded as the opportunist who took advantage of the welfare provided by the Government. He was adopted into a leftist and non-religious family that loved him unconditionally. With a strong foundation, he was left to explore and discover his true identity. The movie spanned from his early childhood until his adult year when his life came a full circle. A movie that's beautifully made and overwhelmingly powerful. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent epic film,"This DVD was stunning in scope and delightful to watch. I loved this film! It shows how the gift of life traveled with a dearly beloved young boy, and how this adopted child became the recipient of enormous love and good fortune in his new homeland. I did not know adoptive parents could summon up such wisdom and passion for a chosen child.The acting is splendid, the photography is lush and you will fall in love with this saga about a remarkable young man."
4,"Brilliant, expanding foreign film experience","Right off, there is a would-be sex scene with a prostitute that I would definitely advise not showing - actually not of benefit to any age, but I think it's worth viewing on a number of levels if you like to ""travel"" and learn for movie nights. Watch first and skip over that scene (part of Schlomo's young adult/Israeli soldier year) for family viewing. This is a very warm and human story, one of the best ever.I've been waiting patiently for it's release - was told it would be winter 2007, but it's popularity had it making the rounds in theatres catering to foreign films I guess."
1,Product pictured is not the product being sold,"I dont know if the problem lies with Milton (the manufacturer,) the vendor, or me, but I was seeking an adapter with 3/8"" OD threads. The product being shipped has 5/8"" OD threads (see added photos.)Since the vendor is a Marketplace vendor, they do not cover return shipping. So, I'm out 2 bucks shipping and I still need need a 3/8"" threaded milton adapter."
3,Good but inaccurate,I found this calendar to be very cute. The information on development was fun to read each day. The days past and the days remaining were correct but the weeks weren't. For some reason the weeks were off by a week. I followed the instructions in filling out the dates and my dates matched up with the days on each page but the weeks didnt match. Im not sure how they calculated the weeks but its wrong. For example it will say 85 days is 13 weeks but if you divide that by 7days a week it is week 12.I love the calendar otherwise but I had to go through and correct the week number on each page because it was wrong. Hopefully they will correct this error in the next edition.
1,Didnt work for me either!,"In the case that you can't just wedge it to something inside your car, the suction cups are just horrible. I did more fighting with this shade than any other infant product that I own."
3,Blocks sun but does not stick to window,"I have been using this shade in my 2003 Chevy Malibu. It does a pretty good job of blocking the sun from my son's eyes while still allowing me to see through it. However, it does not stick to the window. I think it may be more of a design issue with my car than with the shade. The inside of my back window is covered with tiny black rubberized dots (not sure of their purpose?). The cling-style shades won't stick to it either. I have been propping this shade up but it has fallen a few times. I plan to try to use safety pins to attach to the ceiling and seat. I can't give it more stars because I have had to come up with my own attachment process. But I would recommend it to someone looking to block sun from the rear window. Maybe others will have better luck getting it to suction on."
2,not very effective,"we bought this for the back of our '97 acura integra because our 1 year old goes nuts when the sunlight hits him in the face while he is in his rearfacing carseat. Unfortunately, this shade doesn't block out much except for my view out the back window. The suction cups fall off about 20% of the time. the shade isn't big enough so there is alot of uncovered window space. When the angle is just right for the shade to block out sunlight, it only filters it a little. Still looking for a better alternative but haven't found anything else yet...."
4,Great shade but not perfect.,"The suction cups at the top of the shade are great but do not allow the shade to touch the top of the window. With our car it ends up allowing a large strip of sun to shine across our baby's head. We ""fixed"" this problem by kind of squishing the flexible shade on top of the back of the seat so it pushes higher and touches the top of the window.It's very nice to be able to see so well out the back window and yet have the protection for our daughter who is rear-facing in her car seat."
1,Item didn't work for me,"I found that as soon as I put it up, it fell down again. Useless! It didn't provide much shade even when up."
2,Not the greatest,This shade was not long enough or wide enough to cover the rear window of our Saturn sedan. The sunlight was always on our son's face no matter how we tried to position the shade.
2,Waste of money,"This product was a waste of money it didnt work, doesn't stick to the window..I had to purchase some else."
1,This is not Sunshine Kid sun stop sunshade!!!!!,I bought Sunshine Kid sunshade last year and wanted to purchase more. However the products I got are not Sunshine Kid. They don't even have a brand. They are packed in plastic bags. That's it! They look different from the picture. They are also different from the Sunshine kid sunshade I have.
1,Won't stay in place,"Suction cups are terrible. Made sure glass was clean before I put it up. Used water to moisten the suction cups. But of course, it fell down. Pretty useless, I'd say, if it won't even stay in place for more than a few mintues. I can't have this thing falling on my baby while he's riding in the back. Returning."
1,Not worth it....,"I needed something for the side window on our van. Unfortunately, it does not stay in place. You put it up and usually within an hour it has fallen down."
5,cute,"this is very well made, delicate and light and quite detailed. if you rosin up the bow it actually plays too (well... it squeaks) great addition to my mini violin, which looks more like a viola compared to this xD"
2,Not that entertaining,"The Countess Ashby is a twit and her servant Alpiew is actually the smart, feisty, sensible one. If you like the characters you might find it interesting, but I really didn't find either one to be anything more than a stereotype."
3,Not my favorite,"This book tries too hard to be funny, but rarely succeeds. I suppose that's the whole point--mimicking the style of the times--but I didn't care for it. The opening scene is as crass as possible, but the rest of the plot isn't too bawdy or disgusting (apart from murdered bodies). I enjoyed the mystery solving aspect of the novel, and the twist at the end was a nice touch."
3,Good...but not great,"This is a decent box set from Hank Jr,but it's far from being perfect.There are too many hit songs that are missing on here.For example.Where is ""Young Country""? Or ""Good Friends,Good Whiskey and Good Lovin""? Or how about ""If The South Would Have Won"".There are just too many singles missing here.I think that these songs were more like album choice cuts,that Hank personally wanted to put on here or something.I'm not sure.There is some previously unreleased stuff in here though.Such as a couple of outtakes from the Montana Cafe sessions,which are ""Wild Dogs"" and his cover of ""Secret Agent Man"".There is also an outtake from the Rowdy sessions as well.Which is ""Waiting On The Tables To Turn"".Overall,this is an okay set.But I would recommend getting his other box instead.There's more hits and less filler."
5,A must for any Hank William Fan,"This is by far his best CD, a must have for the Hank William Jr Fans out there"
3,Buy the old stuff,"Hanke Williams Jr has recorded some great stuff--New South, Family Tradition, Whiskey Bent & Hell Bound--that you can pick up for $6 bucks a cd. The box set and the complete Hank Williams jr set (for [item price] for the two of them!) have just way too much filler. Do you really want ""This ain't Dallas"" or the theme to Monday Night football. By all means, spend your money on Hank, but spend it wisely."
2,Redneck party music,"Thank god I bought this used! I'd heard a couple of Hank Jr. late 70's cds, and thought I'd check out his whole career. What a mistake! He peaked out early, with ""Wiskey Bent and Hell Bound"". Don't bother after that, unless you just want redneck party music, with no depth and no originality. Bad country-rock covers of ZZ Top, Aerosmith, etc, and those are the high points."
5,good,sent back because did not need them gun was sent back to as it did not work right. don't buy it.
4,Pretty good,"For the price of the product, its not to shabby. The best inner thigh routine is when you're at a horizontal posistion, like lying on the floor or in bed, it works your lower abs at that angle too."
2,thighmaster,ok product. does not put much pressure towards thighs to help tone. i could do over 100 reps and still not feel a burn. not for those already in some shape. also hard and indents skin. would advice to place blanket or towel between grip and thigh. tough to stay in between legs so do have to hold on to entire time
1,Fell apart the first week,This did not hold up. The screw in the bottom of the pole came out after the first week. There is no way to tighten the pole to the base. Great idea to store the scooter boards but the design does not hold up. Don't waste your money.
5,Great Scoop for Hard Frozen Ice Cream,"I was skeptical when I first saw this item, however I was tired of having a drawer full of bent spoons. This scoop works great and as advertised. I heat the whole spoon under hot water and scooping out rock hard ice cream is easy. I like the coated spoon better than the bare aluminum one because it protects against one of my kids accidently putting this in the dishwasher and dulling the finish. I have trained my family to just rinse the scoop under tap water and put it back in the drawer.This is pricey for an ice cream scoop, but it's worth it if you eat ice cream frequently and your freezer freezes it rock hard."
5,Ed McBain,Ed McBain is one of my favorite authors! i have all his 87th precinct books.... FABULOUS READS!! he was a wonderful writer and i was sad at his passing. if you like books that things happen on the 1st page and you feel like you are right there....read some of Ed McBains books!!! this one was not a disappointment either!
5,Just see it,"Quite possibly the best motion picture I have ever seen, they just don't make movies like this anymore. Once it gets going 2 hours go by in what feels like 15 minutes. Get this movie now, It'll blow you away."
5,One good movie,This was one of the best movies I have seen I a long time good acting good movie. I would tell every one to go out and buy it I have my copy.
5,Outstanding movie!,This is an outstanding movie in every way. Well made and directed. I only wished it was a longer movie than it is. Fantastic movie! A MUST SEE!
4,the day of the jackal,this by far is one of the best most serious movies ive seen will be in my top collection this was the first movie and later a remake called the jackal with top actors both are suberb movies i like watching the both on a rainy day this is the kind of movies i live for
3,Great Movie... too bad...,"This is a great movie... From the opening newsreel type shots of France and Algiers to the dual stories of the planning of the assassination attempt and the attempt to thwart it, this film delivers a thrilling exxperience. Too bad that it wasn't formatted anamorphically to be shown on a widescreen TV.... as it is, you must watch it in 4:3 aspect mode to see it as it was meant to be seen. For this reason I would recommend that anyone interested in seeing this movie, rent it instead of purchasing the DVD. I hope that someone re-releases this DVD in an anamorphic format at some point in the near future."
4,Silence is Golden,"It is funny that a movie which originally was a book has so little words, especially in the end. That is exactly what makes this movie so good because Zinneman has pulled it off making a book into a movie but doing it so well that the movie can stand on it's own. It is no wonder therefore that this movie was counted among the Top 1000 movies everThe actors were too old so I didn't know any of them but my favorite was the policeofficer hunting down the assasin trying the kill French president de Gaulle.It is still strange to hear really good English spoken by people that are supposed to be French while there are also French people in the movie playing French people with a French accent, a little confusing sometimes.."
1,it never showed,this dvd never showed in both my dvd player neither my laptop please save your money and dont buy it or else u will be disapointed just like me
3,A study of intrigue as it was in the 1960's,"Altough this film has a plausible and entertaining storyline, it is a whimsical and naive tale of intrigue for the modern viewer. The story deals with a plot by French political terrorists who are so inept at assasination that they must hire a ""professional"" killer from Britain to do their work. Action scenes are blissfuly innocent by today's standards, with the villain dispatching people with one ""judo chop"" or trying to use a single shot .22 magnum rifle as an assasination weapon. As a background for the much more plausible and exciting remake (""The Jackal"" with Bruce Willis and Richard Gere) it is an interesting historical study. END"
5,"Excellent, rare gem; intellectual-thriller","They don't make movies like this anymore. This movie was recommended to me over its remake ""The Jackal"". It started out slow, and odd-- a 1970's movie. It slowly picked up speed and became an intellectual masterpiece. We get to see a very smart crook from step one set up his plan to asasinate the president. We see how he covers his tracks; and how the authorities try to follow behind. It's PG for (surprise) frontal female and rear male nudity, implied sexual situations, subdued violence. The director very nicely leaves murders a lot to our imagination and doesn't show every detail of deaths or assaults. The real suspense didn't start for me until half way through the film. It built up more and more until quite a climax at the very end. What a fine job. Truely an ""A"" rate film."
5,Completely credible,"The best political thriller ever made, comparable to, but better than, The Manchurian Candidate and All The President's Men. The story of an assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle, the plot unfolds in such a way as to hold the viewer's interest throughout. The excellent performances by all concerned, the historical background introduced in the opening few minutes and the location filming create a riveting, masterful film. While we all know what the climax must be, it is in doubt to the very last instant.As an added bonus, you can catch Derek Jacobi, in what must be one of his earliest film roles, before his I, Claudius and Brother Cadfael fame.Highly recommended. An all-time favourite!"
4,Don't overlook this excellent film.,"Based on Frederic Forsyth's bestselling novel, this is one of those rare films that does justice to the book.A dissident group within the French Army hire a professional killer to assasinate Charles DeGaulle. The French police and French intelligence are mobilised, but there's one problem, they have no idea who the hitman is or what he looks like.The film is nicely paced and, while it's not laden with special effects, it has no trouble holding your attention. It's a tribute to Forsyth, the screenplay, and the director that, even though you know that DeGaulle was never assasinated, the suspense continues to build throughout the film right up to the end.The picture and sound are only average at best, but the film rates highly enough that any flaws in this 30 year movie can be easily forgiven.Highly recommended!! Just the right combination of suspense and action combined with an intelligent screenplay. Too rarely seen these days."
5,NOW THAT'S A THRILLER!,"First of all, DO NOT, repeat, DO NOT dare to even compare ""The Day of the Jackal"" with the Bruce Willis fiasco you've seen recently on theatres!This is the original, the one and only, the based-on-the-Forsyth-bestseller masterpiece! A truer-to-life thriller -or a more exciting one- you ain't gonna get. Not only the historical background makes it so much more interesting, the characters, locations, narration and pace are top notch! Edward Fox relishes his role of a lifetime as the suave British killer without any blazing gunbattles, car chases, goring bloodfests, profanities or macho rantings that supposedly ""spice up"" movies nowadays.Just compare this golden oldie with it's 1998 abominable remake, to comprehend why ""less is more"" is always wise!"
4,Those Whacky French,"I've always enjoyed Forsyth's books, particularly ""The Odessa File"". This movie is a classic, but I hadn't seen it in a while. I was amused to go back to it after all of these years and catch some ridiculous errors that would not fly in this day and age. People being killed by a single karate chop, a women being strangled to death in about 3 seconds with no struggle...and why did all of these French characters have English accents? Never the less, it still is a great story and an enjoyable movie that gives insight into a post-war / cold-war Europe of which modern Americans have little understanding."
5,Gift,Product arrived in very good condition and ahead of date promised. Vender provided excellent service and delivered what was promised.
4,Better than the book!,"Normally, when I read the book and see the movie (or vice-versa), I prefer the book. Even ""good"" movies don't, in my opinion at least, capture all that the print version offers. But... I'll make an exception for ""Day of the jackal""!This is a sleek, exciting, well done film. Even though you know the ""Jackal"" will ultimately fail in his quest, you'll still enjoy this one immensely. I saw it when it was released in 1973 and I've seen it many, many times since, and it's still fun to watch. Edward Fox as the Jackal and Michel Lonsdale as the detective are great, as is everyone else in this ensemble cast. For fun, try playing ""Spot the actor"" before you see the credits; many well known French and British actors appear in small roles."
4,This movie is one of the best old movies I've ever seen,"The day of the jackal is problably the most interesting story for a long time because there problably isn't such a man like the jackal but there could be one , and Forsyth does a brilliant story about a man who is an assassain and how he plans to assassinate the president of France."
3,STEVIA IS NOT AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER!,"...however, it has a slight licorice taste which takes some getting used to. Please educate yourselves before spreading incorrect information about products that can help many people."
3,Liquid Vitamin,"The shake is ok, tolerable in taste, but still tastes like you chewed a huge vitamin. On a positive note, I have been using it for approximately 4 weeks now. I think it is making a difference in my overall health, and I do plan on continuing with this for at least six months."
3,Just ok,I tried this product and really did not notice much of a difference in my energy level. I will not be purchasing it again. However it did taste pretty good and I was able to drink it mixed only with water.
4,Good supply of vitamins,This is my third cannister of this product. I like it because I can monitor the amount of powder I mix. I ususlly take 1/2 scoop in the morning and 1/2 in the evening. I mix it with grapefruit juice because it is too sweet to mix with water and the juice covers some of the taste.
2,Terrible orange taste ... can't get it down.,The powder is so bitter it I cannot tolerate it long enough to drink it down. Does not mix well into yogurt or anything I tried to hide the taste. This was a waste ...
4,vitamin boost,Great product. I have been using it for years upon advice from my doctor for fibromyalgia. Best price anywhere-speedy delivery.
3,Product is good,Received this product and started using it with just water. Didn't like the taste at all. But then started putting it into a morning smoothie and the taste is much better. Need to start out slow and gradually work up to one scoop as it made me very nauseous. Does give me energy and I certainly feel it if I don't get my morning smoothie.
1,lack of satisfactory results,I did not notice a change at all in how I felt after taking this product. it also is very grainy and did not taste well when put into water. It was very much like sand when used with water and hard to stomach when mixed with yogurt.
2,stomach upset,"I am noticing that the newer reviews are less satisfied now that the b vitamins are in the mix. I ordered it thinking they were a separate pill, as that is how it was described. I don't know if that is the cause, but I sure have had an upset stomach since starting to take this product. I am not sure I am going to be able to continue. Today was my second day and today was worse than yesterday. I am going to try 1/2 scoop tomorrow but if it causes stomach problems I will have to give it up. I like the ingredients and the fact that I am not taking a lot of hard pills--which also upset my stomach. I do okay with capsules but it is hard to find vitamins and minerals in capsule form. I also notice that this review shows the citrus flavor and I am using the berry. Not a great taste but not as bad as some I have tried."
2,"Used to taste great, not anymore!","I used to like this product but now they have included the b-complex into the powdered drink and it is horrible. It taste bad, has a yucky after taste that lingers and worse of all, it burns my throat. I found it much easier to take one capsule and have the drink then how it is now. I hope more people complain about this product so that it can go back to the way it used to be!"
3,Good product/Shoddy Quality,"I have owned two of these toothbrushes over the past two years. I currently own this model, and I believe that the last one was the same model. It's very economical, cleans my teeth well, all in all, a great toothbrush. What is the problem then?? BOTH of the brushes I have owned have had a faulty on/off switch. What has happened about six months to a year into ownership is that the toothbrush will not turn off unless it is placed in its charger. This is obviously inconvenient, as well as being a shame, considering that Braun has made such a good reasonably priced brush otherwise. I would not buy it again, and I don't know if I will buy another Braun. I would hate to spend more money on a model and have the same thing happen."
2,Braun problems,I have owned two of the Braun toothbrushes. I loved them and my dentist was impressed with the improvement in the condition of my gum tissue. The problem? The first one refused to start after a period of time. The second one refused to stop. So I probably won't buy this model again for that reason. They are too expensive to not last longer in my opinion.
5,Great product,"Nice sound if you want to add shakers to your drumming circle. Recommend for all ages. Product is sturdy, good for both indoor and outdoor drum circles."
3,Faithful Folios Review of The Golden Cross,Vertical Reach = 3Jessica is searching but others in the book have a good representation of their relationship with God.Ministry Message = 3People seeking peace can find it in the Lord and possibly love as well.Craft = 4Robin Gunn Jones writes the romance formula well.Aesthetics = 3Cover is nice and appropriate but not eye catching.Dollar$ and $ense = 3.5
3,Predictable,"I like this author, but I'm becoming very frustrated with how predictable her books are. It's always extremely easy to figure out who the culprit is, and the hero/heroine ends up looking stupid because it takes them so long to figure it out. Perhaps the author needs to work more on her red herrings and suspense and less on graphic sex scenes."
3,WARING...THIS BOOK IS VERY GRAPHIC,"This is the first book I read by Beverly Barton. Mostly it is a good book. I loved the involment of the characters and even the ending. It has a great plot and is very suspensful.All of that is if you can get past the very graphic rape and torture scenes. Why has no one else warned us about it in the reviews? I am not a very timid person and I know that these happen in the real world but, I do not want my leisurely read to make me want to vomit. After about the 3rd rape scene, I would just skip over the part with the killer and go on to the next chapter. I read one scene before bed and I had the worst time falling asleep because I was thinking about all the poor women that this has really happened to.I am not sure if I will read another book by Beverly Barton because I am scared that all her books are written like this one."
2,Predictable pulp!,"This is my 'first' read of Ms. Barton and it will be my last! In myhumble opinion, she is obsessed with sexual deviates and writes a verypredictable, boring read!"
2,Close Enough Not to Like it!,"The previous Beverly Barton book I read was 'Killing Her Softly' and I really enjoyed it. So going into 'Close Enough to Kill' I had bigger expectations, and 'Close Enough to Kill' quickly fell short.My biggest frustration with it was I'd figured out the ""who dunnit"" part of the book very quickly, and ended up just page turning to see if indeed my prediction came true--and it did. I also felt there were to many victims. Since the villain lured each of his victims the same way it was like re-reading previous chapters, with the only difference being the victims name. With those two combined, and topped off with the slow building relationship between the Sheriff and her Deputy the book just seemed to drag.I will read another Beverly Barton book, however, if the next one falls short like this one did, I'll cut my loses and move on."
2,Rewriting needed,"Apparently I'm in the minority here, but I really do not think Close Enough To Kill is in any way a great, taut, suspenseful thriller. On the contrary, everyone except the serial killer seems to mosey around, spending page after page making coffee, messing up their relationships and training puppies.The search for the killer in this small corner of Alabama becomes a secondary occupation, with the sherriff and her whole staff increasingly unfocused and the story increasingly diluted and side-tracked. Structurally, the novel starts well and then simply peters out as the good guys stand around wondering what to do next and trying to figure out where they stand with each other.The author and her editors should have decided once and for all whether this was to be a romantic novel or a thriller and then balanced it accordingly. And definitely limited the pages repeatedly spent describing the office coffee maker..."
4,Excellent!,"Just finished this book and have to say, I loved it. Loved the way the romances were built. Robyn drove me buggy, but Bernie was accustomed to dealing with her sister and that men always saw Robyn. I had several suspects and one by one they were eliminated until the real killer was revealed. Loved the way the identity of the killer was not revealed even through the victims thoughts. This is the first book I've read by this author and I look forward to reading more."
4,Good holiday read,"This book is easy to read, can be put down and come back to later, a good holiday reading book."
5,Christmas present sent the day before Christmas Eve,"It made our Christmas complete, my husband said it was his favorite present besides having his family home. It was perfect. Thank you."
3,Good but a bit overrated,"After reading several of the reviews here, I purchased this one. I'd planned it, anyway, since last Christmas (each year my wife and I purchase a few more Christmas dvds). All I can say is that this was not my most exceptional purchase. It appears that the reviewers here are looking at this one through rose-colored glasses. Now, we own 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' (on the Peanuts 1960s Collection), all the important Rankin/Bass ('Rudolph', 'Santa Claus is Comin to Town', 'Frosty', etc) and 'Mr Magoo's Christmas Carol' (all on 'The Original Christmas Classics'), 'It's a Wonderful Life', 'Little Women' (1994 version), 'Dr Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas', 'A Christmas Story', etc ... but they are all good on their own level. This one, however, is simply for those who grew up with it and have fond memories, for memories are all that could push this one forward."
5,Good ole memories,I will never get tired of watching this. This brings back the best memories of Christmas when I was a kid.
1,Didn't like the whole DVD,"The only GOOD cartoon on here is Mickey's Christmas Carol...Although Small One was a sweet cartoon, it was just too sad of a cartoon to add to this collection. The Santa cartoon was REALLY boring, and the Pluto cartoon was ok...I watch cartoons all the time, and this was one of my not so good purchases...I'd rather watch Mickey's Twice Upon A Christmas...I am not please with this DVD at all..."
5,Sweet.,Used to have this on a video but misplaced it. Glad to find it in DVD format. It is a short retelling of the classic story and very charming. There is a scary part (with the ghost of Christmas future) that may need you to hold on to some really tiny ones.
5,Love Mickey Donald & Friends,This is a cute Christmas dvdI always enjoy Disney characters and this movie was done wellGood for kids of all agesrecommend this dvd
4,Very Pleased,"This movie is one of my dad's favorite christmas movies, so seeing his face light up when he unwrapped it up was well worth it. The disk is in great shape and plays well. My only complaint, if you can call it that, is the case itself had a small piece broken off. But it is possible with the way mail is delivered today this is the fault of those who delivered it and not the the seller"
4,Awesome,One of the best versions of this story. Includes some very old animations from 30's and 40's. Shorter than I remember as a child.
5,Classic Disney,I bought this for my 3-1/2 year old granddaughter and she loved it. I've already recommended it to friends for their grandchildren. Classic Disney animated shorts with Mickey and Donald's Christmas Carol the main attraction. Its a must have for any Christmas collection.
5,Mickey's Christmas Carol,"I grew up watching this cartoon, along with the Pluto's Christmas Tree, when it was on TV every year. It brings a feeling of nostalgia that is non-replaceable, and now I can share the wonderful stories with my young girls. Two additional classic cartoons round out the DVD, and my daughter loves them as well. I highly recommend these endearing cartoons!"
1,"Audio Stops, Color Awful!","The audio stopped shortly after the movie began. The color is awful. All green and pink. I'm going to exchange this simply because I like the original movie.Update: I exchange the bad dvd for a new one. It's been three weeks, and it's still in transition.Second Update: NEVER received my order! I am receiving a refund, and ordering directly from Disney."
5,"Great, glad I got it","I usually waited all season for it to come on tv and some years I would miss it, so I am so glad I got it on DVD. It has a couple of extras which was great."
4,"Mickey's Christmas Carol, an old favorite","While Mickey's Christmas Carol has long been a favorite, this collection also includes Pluto's Christmas Tree, The Small One, and Santa's workshop"
5,"love, love, love this movie!!!",this is simply one of the best little animated christmas movies. i grew up on this movie and my son loves it as well. i highly recommend to anyone who has little children.
1,short connectors,Nothing wrong with this cable for most people I'm sure. Didn't work for me in a W/D My Book studio II external hard drive at the connection the plugs were to short no make a good connection. The drive case adds a 16th of an inch or so to the length needed to connect correctly so my puter only saw the drive intermittently. Traded it and a few bucks for another for one that would work at my local computer guys store and they seemed aware that the cable connectors come in a few length and took it off my hands. So it might work for you didn't for me.
1,Didn't work.,"Cable did not work with multiple eSATA hard drives I tested. Wouldn't find a connection on the PC and I know it's not my SATA card, because I have other cables that work fine with it."
5,made well work perfectly,"these cables are made well, used in an engineering environment, meet our needs, large body for determining sheet metal layout of connectors"
5,meets expectations,"This cable allows data transfer to some external hardrives. It carries data at the best speed at which they can write to the disk. unlike slower transfer over USB, the data flow is continuous and the external drive does not stop spinning or even slow down. I created a 113 GB disk image in 40 minutes with the eSATA cable compared to 8 hours or more with USB 2."
4,Works as I expected,"Got this for my external hard drive. It seems to have a constant speed of 75 Mb/s. Recently I found my old one that this replaced and checked the transfer speeds and my 12 inch one maxed at 196 Mb/s vs. this one's 112 Mb/s. It works excellently although I don't understand the difference in speed, maybe length? But a good buy and having it be so long is occasionally more convenient than having top speed."
4,DVR to hard drive,Works great. Not of highest quality. Using it with WOW Ultra tv DVR to hard drive. Never going to move it so good enough for my use.
4,Works fine but you may need additional power,The cable itself is great but the device I am using requires additional power so I still had to plug in a USB cable as well.This is annoying and is (possibly) a limitation of esata.... Hence 4 stars not 5.
1,not good enough to be called JUNK...,These cables are SO stiff and inflexible that they will damage the device they connect to.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE CABLES. Shop elsewhere.
1,Waste of money,Didn't work right out of the package. Dont waste your money on this P.O.S.....I guess you buy cheap you get cheap.
4,"Good overall cable, rather inflexible.","This cable appears to be well shielded and has good length for the price. The only drawback would be the inflexible nature of the cable, making it difficult to use with a desktop replacement/notebook. If you have a desktop setup then the cable would be perfect since it would remain in nearly the same orientation but it is difficult to get the cable to change directions otherwise."
1,"Not StarTech Brand, Instead Generic","Expected StarTech model ESATA6, which gets good reviews on NewEgg. Unfortunately, this one is a generic cable. The connector overmold are of a different shape, it comes in a bag labeled C-654-06 with no company name. Hopefully, Bargain Cable can send out actual StarTech brand. Give it one star for being not what I ordered and probably inferior."
4,"No problems, just a bit stiff","Cable transferred data perfectly. However, I ended up swapping out cables due to fact that it was very stiff and difficult to manipulate when moving around with an external hard drive hooked up to my laptop (carrying it from room to room). For stationary needs, this is a great cable."
4,"Yay, cable!","Seems to work as advertised. I do have the occasional problem of the end connecting my external hard drive coming loose just enough to loose connection, but that is probably due more to the unfortunate placement of said drive and playful cats."
5,Used for tivo expander drive,Does what it's supposed to do. Plugged it in and no problems. Seems well constructed with no intereference from other devices.
3,No warning was given about 64 bit computers.,"It seems that there are no drivers for eSATA use with 64 bit Windows 7. I'd bought an external green drive that has eSATA capability but cannot use it that way. Nightly backups take up to six or seven hours via USB for my large amount of data, and I'm going to have to locate a backup drive internally on an SATA cable instead of keeping its heat outside of the case. 64 bit systems are not yet ready for eSATA because the drivers are not yet written.If anybody learns where to download 64-bit drivers for eSATA, please comment on this review site. Thanks."
4,A great new author...,"Swollen is a story about first love: how it happens, what it feels like, and what it does to you. Sam is a great character; she's not the perfect daughter or student and she knows it, but she's strong and focused and never complains. Her home life isn't perfect either but she accepts it for what it is. Farouk and Sam's relationship is SO well documented, as Melissa Lion really focuses on Sam's feelings and thoughts. Reading this book was very nostalgic for me, because the characters were so real and their relationships reminded me of my own time in high school.I'm looking forward to reading Melissa Lion's next book when it comes out. Her style is very comfortable, and her observations are sharp and truthful. I felt like she was writing just for me. I devoured this book."
4,Another Fine CD!,"I would like to give it 4.5 stars because of the high quality of the sound, playing, and tunes. It is a little repetitive, but the band sounds a bit tighter to me, especially Gary Meek on saxophone. I wish all fusion CDs were this good."
1,Same Different!,"Honestly, I think this album is pretty crap..am not braggin about the technique or their style..but if u listen to every song carefully, each of them actually is very similar to a song in either synergy or transition. They are just played differently but using similar scales and grooves and they make it sounds way more busy..and harder to listen to for first timer listener of this Genre.Quite frankly, I'm pretty dissapointed with this album. I would expect something ""NEW"" as they normally never failed to show us.*SIGHH*I hate to say this cuz they are one of my favourite band!"
2,Same Old Same Old,"If someone asked me what album I'd recommend to get an average feel for what Dave's records are like, I'd recommend this one, because it averages just about everything he does. His latest albums seem to follow a formula of certain grooves that feature his spactacular playing (no doubt about it), but I bought this formula in the last few studio albums already. Trust me, if you have two or three of Weckl's previous works - you already have this album as well!"
1,"More notes and more notes, no feel/groove","Funny to rate a Dave Weckl album a 1 of 5, but listening to these clips...the music lacks....balls, yes balls. No punch, groove, and anything inspiring. When I listen to say, Stern/Chambers play, there is more power in the music. This stuff is serious spunk.No doubt, Weckl is one of my favorite drummers and he has chops like crazy and a unique style, but for the music he plays...it's weak in my book. Sure, technically difficult, but so is walking a tight rope, so what. With that whining sax soloing until the cows come home, etc. Throw some other instrumentation or maybe stop playing so many freakin notes all the time, it gets a bit much to listen to. I could listen to Weckl solo forever, but in a musical context, this music leaves me uninspired."
4,Looks good and very functional!,"The cubes shipped fast and I put them together while 9 months pregnant so they were fairly easy to assemble. They look great in the nursery and can hold a nice amount of books, diapers, toys, or whatever your storage needs are.I order these same cubes from Target and it's been over a month and they never came."
3,Beware - Shelves are not Hard Plastic,"These are great for clothes or larger items, but I'm using them for cleaning supplies and toiletries. The shelves are rather flimsy, and they sink when things are put on them. They're better than the wire ones in that they don't have holes, but getting any bottle of shampoo or lotion to stand up is a nightmare. Okay, very cute, but not super functional."
5,MOLTO BENE!,"This book has true, authentic Italian recipes that taste out of this world! I especially like all the information provide about the various pastas, cheeses, herbs, etc. The recipes are wonderful but most are not for the novice cook. If you love Italian food and love to cook, definitely try to find a copy of this book!"
4,Origami for idea lovers?,This gentle and delightful book is an edited transcript of a weekend seminar where David Bohm was joined by a group of open-minded souls to have a true dialogue about the nature or meaning and how we might explore it. The result is an engaging and challenging dance of ideas that describe and unfold a little of the origami of unknowable complexity that is Bohm's implicate order world view. It's a book that inspires you to think about it long after you reach its deliberately inconclusive end.
5,Excellent Textbook,"This is an excellent textbook for a two semester course in General, Organic, and Biological Chemistry for Health Professions. It does a very good job of explaining the concepts of General, Organic, and Biological Chemistry. It also has excellent applications on disease processes and pathophysiology. The organization of each chapter is a plus. I highly recommend this textbook. It is number one!"
5,"Fundamentals of General, Organic, and Biological Chemistry","This book is a very good and comprehensive view of the basics in general, organic, and biological Chemistry. I also like the fact that the book gives many examples and problems to work with. I recommend the study guide which can be purchased separately to go along with this book as it has been a very useful tool for me in my effort to complete this course."
4,Good intro to chemistry book,Worked well for my chemistry class. I ended up getting a B in the class so I'm pretty satisfied with this book.
5,Great Deal!!!,"I'm glad I checked Amazon instead of buying this book from school. I saved a lot of money. The book came super fast and was in like-new condition, better than I expected!"
1,Where's the cover?,"I purchased this book online to save some money instead of buying it in the overpriced university book store. The condition was advertised as being ""Like New"". When the book arrived it had no hard cover on it, or any cover at all for that matter. All the pages are in fine shape and all the material is there, but there is no cover at all."
2,"This product was a great value, however,","This product was a great value; however, it did not perform well for our church. We had a big problem with feedback."
2,Bath Pillow just ok,I have had many bath pillows before. This one would be great but the plug will not stay closed. It seemed like too much of a hassle to send it back being that it was so inexpensive. Maybe I just got a defective one..hopefully so!
2,Dry and un- engaging,"Waiting for Godot is one of those plays that has been analyzed to death. Readers, scholars and critics see every line of dry dialogue as indicative of our bored complacency about the world around us. This book has lodged its place as a philosophical milestone to such a degree that you rarely hear the question posed: did you actually enjoy it?This is my issue. I think that literature at its best functions as engaging, entertaining, and meaningful. This play is so dryly written, so up in its ivory tower, and so tedious that I have a hard time believing anyone actually has a good time reading it. All it's good for is picking apart and disecting later- once you've suffered through it.If you're interested in existentialism I'd suggest Sartre. You might even enjoy it."
3,"If you are A D D, you may not like this book","I read this book and started thinking, hmmmm... what could possibly be the moral of the story? I was young then, didn't get much. I later read it again this week. I really enjoyed it much more. I have a lot more patience now."
1,Worst Play Ever by Worst Playwright Ever,"I love live theater, reading plays, watching video of plays.In all sincerity, this play is the worst play ever by the worst playwright ever.The core idea of the play is that life is meaningless, something you ""get"" 5 minutes into it.But the playwright makes us experience that life is meaningless, in slow-motion.I would rather experience open heart surgery without anesthetics than to ever endure this play again. It's that bad. No, it's worse."
5,Surprizingly full of colour pictures!,"This book surprized me with its concise text, but full of informations, not only regarding the jewels, but also with a short description of each kingdom it belong(ed) to, since centuries ago!Almost all pictures are coloured. It is a jewel in itself."
4,Illustrated Bradbury Classics!,"THE RAY BRADBURY CHRONICLES - THE AUTHORIZED ADAPTATIONS - VOLUME THREEASIN: B000H44NWKExcellent trade paperback graphic novel containing official comic style adaptations of 5 classic Ray Bradbury Tales...There Will Come Soft Rains; The Veldt; Gotcha!; Homecoming; The Aqueduct.All by some of the best comic writers/illustrators in the business: Timothy Truman; Steve Leialoha; Bruce Jensen; Chuck Roblin, and more. This is the 3rd volume in the series, and includes bio-blurbs of the creators, an introduction by Bradbury, plus he also introduces each tale, explaining where the idea for it came from. Also includes a bonus reprint of a classic Bradbury story adapted by Wally Wood, which was originally presented in the infamous EC Comics series of the Fifties. Excellent art, color, and story telling make this a TPB no Bradbury fan can be without.Soft cover, full color, slick pages. A Bantam Trade Paperback. 1992."
2,Nice Design but Not a Fan,I like the Design and idea behind it but you would have to stand less than 10 inches from it to feel anything. It just doesn't push air which I thought was the point of a fan.
2,It was good while it was working,"The fan was OK .. it was quiet - the nylon strap/blades can't hurt you - if it is really hot and you want it to push a lot of air - this isn't the fan for you, if you want it to push a little air then it is OK. It is quiet. My biggest gripe is that it broke - motor stopped after about 6 months of use - not every day use either. I 'm kind of disappointed in this fan due to it breaking - when it did work it was OK."
4,good fan for the money,"Nice fan works well to keep condensation down on my bay window on cold MN days, Quiet but not silent, very good value"
4,works great,"I've had two or three of these small fans that have lasted for many years. In warm weather, I very often leave one running all night in my bedroom. They make hardly any noise compared to larger fans. They fold up and are very handy for travel. Plus, they look pretty cool."
5,Excellent desk fan,This fan is a must for every desk bound person out there. It is quiet and pushes the right amount of air that anyone could want.I am a fan for life!
5,I love this fan!,"I am about to purchase my second fan of this type because sadly, my first one just died with over a year of good, reliable, and probably excessive use!I probably used this fan every day during most of the year (except winter) and it would be on anywhere from 4-10 hours a day. Some may say that it doesn't provide enough power, but in my office it was perfect and quiet. Since it doesn't circulate (which I don't want) I actually have it across the room from me and it kept the air moving without it blowing directly in my face.I especially love the cloth fan blades, they're super easy to clean (takes 1 minute to clean them!) and of course it can't injure anyone if you hit it. It is a little heavy, but I actually like that, as some personal fans I have had in the past have a way of vibrating themselves right off the table!I was so sad to see mine poop out- love that I found it again on Amazon!"
1,TOO FANCY,I got this fan for $20. All of my friends got better fans for less. I ve to sit within a rage of 2 feet from this fan. It looks pretty good.But not worth it. I m sure there are other fans for less which will keep u much cooler.
2,Fan stopped working after one day,"2 stars for the design / 1 star for poor product performance.This Zippi just stopped working after leaving it on for a few hours... too bad because its clever design blew a nice, soft breeze for its size. And with fabric blades it seemed like a safe fan to have on the floor in a corner of my small office. It ran quietly at both speeds, too.BUT! we're disappointed not just because the motor stopped working, but because this is my second Vornado fan to break down. First was the $100+ Silver Swan Retro-style whose motor failed at the lowest setting within the 1st year and then was completely gone at both settings about a week later. And now this little platinum model stops within a day. A simple $10 plastic fan is more reliable. Save your money, I wish I did."
2,Quite but too weak,"Pros: This is the quietest fan I've ever used. I use it on a desk at work and I love how quiet the fan is.Cons: Unfortunately, it doesn't move much air and the breeze it creates is not very well directed. You'll find that papers up to 18 inches to the left or right of the fan will flutter around but you won't feel much breeze directed at you. The design is also poor. The only way to turn the fan up/down or off is by reaching past the (cloth) blades. I'm constantly clipping myself as I adjust the fan and although it doesn't hurt, it makes a racket and can be a bit startling."
4,Just enough air circulation,"I bought this fan for my desk at work.have been using the fan the just about every day and it provides enought air circulation to keep me cool.But the fan is not that far from me.If your expecting to use this from far, buy something bigger, but if your looking for something to put on your desk, this is perfect."
2,Vornado's Worst Fan,"I love Vornado's product line, but the ""Zippi"" is simply a mistake.Upon opening this product I was happy with its look and feel, but upon plugging it in, felt little air flow on either speed.Within ten minutes of using this, the spinning piece fell off the base unit, and now my fan hardly works.I will be returning this mistake of a purchase and trying the Vornado ""flippi"""
1,Not Worthy of the Vornado Brand Name,"Pathetically underachieving desk fan. Folks looking for a small but POWERFUL desk fan should take a look at the similar model from Brookstone's which features -- gasp -- plastic blades. That fan actually moves some air and is as quiet and compact as the Zippi. Otherwise, check out Vornado's own ""Tiny Tornado"" -- the little air circulator. That's an outstanding fan."
1,A fan in name only,"I wish I'd listened to the reviews that didn't like this fan. On the high setting, the breeze it creates only carries six inches--I measured it. So if you want to feel a breeze and don't mind holding this six inches away from your face, then this is the fan for you. Otherwise, get something else."
2,Didn't Live Up to Expectations,I purchased this very sleek cool looking fan for my husband's office desk. This desk fan has no punch! It does not provide the speed you hoped for on hot days.
2,Underachiever,"Vornado is my one of my favorite fan manufacturers. But, this fan is just for cute. It's near silent on its low speed and produces a breeze that can be felt on high speed. If you want a desk fan that really performs, purchase a Caframo. Vornado's larger models are real performers."
4,Great little fan,"I first I was surprises to see that the blades were made out of cloth, but when I turned it on it worked great and it is absolutely quiet. Also, the cloth blades make it less dangerous if you hit the fan with your hand. The only small negative is that it could be a little stronger at peak power setting."
2,cool looks poor performance,if you want a fan that moves air avoid this one. Even on high the fan feels like nothing more than a young girl blowing out her birthday candels.
5,Vornado Fans,I have three of the regular Vornado fans in my home and got tired of replacing the small computer desks fans over and over as they got noisy and stopped working. Vornado products work and work well! Received item quickly and was a good value.
5,"Cool, quiet, and compact.","If you're looking for a cool, quiet, and compact fan, you probably won't be disappointed."
3,Fine while it lasted,"I was the proud owner of one for about 1 year. It worked fine for what I needed, just enough to create a slightly draft of air, when aimed right at my face from about 3 feet away.... I will say it was quiet enough.... but before it stopped working I had to stop using the lowest setting and go the higher setting because it would not work at the lower setting... Now it is completely frozen up, doesn't spin at all... If it were $10 I would buy another because it would be worth it for another year... but not for anymore than $10."
1,broke very quickly,"I loved the fan so much I quickly bought one for my daughter and one for my desk at work. Now 2/3 of the fans have stopped working, and of course the return policy is ridiculous."
1,Vornado is a neat idea -- but it died after one month,This fan was great in concept but it died after a month. I bought a replacement fuse and that didn't fix it. I tried to return it be the vendor didn't accept returns after ~ 30 days.
5,Great little fan,"I got my (black) Zippi fan today and the first thing that struck me when I took it out the box is how heavy it is.....really solid construction...and a nice retro chic look too. Now, I bought the fan to cool my amplifier and this fan is really serving the purpose. First it is very quiet...at the lower speed it cannot be heard unless you stick you ear right next to it....and no need to worry, if the fan touches your ear it will just tickle as the cloth blades are a great safety feature without compromising performance. It blows sufficient breeze to remove the heat buildup in the amp and provides excellent vertical plane adjustment. I am really satisfied with this product. Now, a word of caution....if you just came out of the sun and sweating bullets, this fan will NOT cool you down....nor will it cool a room...it is meant to work in close proximity to you (like at a desk) to give a gentle but constant breeze to keep you feeling fresh...no more."
2,Great little fan... while it works,"I love(d) these fans. They're small enough to fit on a desk or to travel with. They're extremely quiet. They're safe around children. They're even stylish. Unfortunately, in my experience, they just don't last. I've owned four, and the motors have given out on all of them. I started with one at work and one at home. The first one gave out after several months. The second one gave out not long after. I replaced them both, supposing it to be a fluke, but in a few months the third one gave out, too. It took the better part of a year, but finally the last one gave out, too. It's too bad, because otherwise they were great fans."
2,Okay if it is really close,"It is an okay enough fan if you are using it at a distance of about 2 feet. Past 4 feet you will not feel anything even on high. My fan started making noises at about 2 months of age, some oil seems to have fixted it for now but it does make me question the quality of the motor.I would not purchase this fan again."
5,"Quiet, cute and enough air at low speed!","The title says it all. This little fan is perfect for those of us who become warm at intervals (we know who we are). A yellow Zippi fan is on my desk and is so quiet that I forgot to turn it off last night. The controls are behind the soft fabric ""blades"", so turning it off or changing the speed is a bit awkward but harmless. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
4,"safe, works","My office AC has not worked for 3 days now. This is what's keeping me at work. It's safe. Looks alright. It cools my cubicle well. Not the most powerful fan, but you can get it to be quiet in the low setting, and it does a good job."
3,So-So,"This fan does its job, but the one I got seems to be slightly un-balanced. On the low setting it is just about silent. However on the higher setting, it seems to vibrate a bit.Other than that minor complaint, this fan is a good fan. It folds up when not in use into a very small package, which makes it convenient for storing.It also blows a good amount of air for having fabric blades."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS VORNADO PRODUCT!,"I have purchased about 8 of these fans over the course of the last two years. Big Mistake. They are time bombs that will just stop working and probably within a years time. Very badly made product, and talk about planned obsolescence, this is a great example!6 of them broke within a year. Just stopped working, no power, no nothing. Vornado replaced them and guess what? Broke again, no power, just died.Based on my experience with other larger Vornado room fans I have purchased, I had thought this was a reputable company that made quality products. Well, I was wrong, they do large fans very well, and they do small fans very badly!My advice steer clear, even for 18 bucks!"
1,Broke after 2 hours of use!!!,Please don't bother buying this fan. I did and it ran 2 hours and broke. The return policy on this is so cost prohibitive it made more sense to run to WalMart and buy a different one. Do yourself a favor and find a different alternative.
1,Disappointing...,"Quit working after weeks, despite very little use. Also, the stitching was loose upon arrival. I otherwise liked the general concept of a small and quiet desk fan."
1,Flash in the pan..,"It worked surprisingly well for about 2 weeks, and then died a sudden and disappointing death."
1,Disappointing,"Really disappointed. The fan doesn't put out much air, isn't whisper quiet, then broke after an hour of usage."
5,vornado fan very handy,"These fans were perfect for my parents who needed something lightweight, portable, and quiet but yet still moved the air around since they couldn't control the A/C in their unit."
4,Great little fan. Bad unit.,"I LOVE this fan. I do. It's small. It's quiet. It's fun to stick your finger into the blades.BUT.Mine started making a buzzing/grinding noise. Basically the bearing wore out. I only had it for a couple of weeks when it started. I found that if I flip the fan upside-down it doesn't buzz anymore, so that's how I'm using it. Upside-down!PLUS:SmallEasy to pack and take with you.Quiet (You almost can't hear it when it's on low.)Just right for a desk or bedside table.MINUS:Bearing wore out in 2 weeks. (I assume this is a rare occurrence, and it's certainly not stopping me from buying another.)Not big enough for a whole room. (This is a personal fan. It's not going to move air around your office/bedroom.)"
2,"Nice design, poor build quality","Really wanted to like this fan and had high hopes after reading all the reviews. Unfortunately, bad build quality is the real killer here. Love the design and it pushes a fairly decent amount of air for its size (low is like a light breeze, high is a medium breeze), but it's just way too noisy due to bad build quality. On low, the fan is quiet for a few seconds then starts buzzing and rattling like there is a loose screw or fitting somewhere, but I cannot find anything loose. On high it rattles even worse and is so loud due to this that it is really unusable in an office setting. I wouldn't purchase this again."
1,Short lived rubbish,"At five months it no longer turns on at all. Took it apart as switch felt ok as did the motor when spun by hand. Wiring intact, no burned spots, switch functional. Took switch apart, no loss of contact, wires intact. Motor doesn't work, no idea why. Worked one day, doesn't work the next. In the garbage it goes. Left in one place, never abused, always worked but less than six months of very intermittent use? Yep, realllll high quality there guys. Won't buy another Vornado product again, should've trusted the other reviews."
2,"don't like the style, fabric propeller","this was a surprise - the fins on the propeller are fabric with small weights at the end so when the fan is not running they kind of flop, which looks weird. Also the fan itself is larger than I expected. Overall there's probably nothing wrong with it but I don't like it."
2,WHAT!?!,I got it a few years ago and just HATED it. It did not blow ANYTHING! And two of the blades looked like they were falling off!
5,Solved a problem...quietly.,"I picked this fan because the description said it was whisper quiet, and it is. My problem was that, according to the manual, my new AV receiver needed 8 inches of overhead clearance for proper heat dispersal. Unfortunately, my sound system rack only has about 2"" of clearance, and there was no doubt I was getting heat build up.This little fan solved that problem. In the beginning I was trying to remember to turn it off with the system, but it's so quiet we usually forgot. Now we've just decided to leave it on all the time. It doesn't produce a hurricane, but it moves plenty of air for my situation."
5,Perfect for travel.,"I purchased this fan specifically for travel. Many times we would find ourselves in hotel rooms or at a friend's home and there was nothing we could really use for the ""white noise"" effect. Hubby and I both like white noise when we sleep and this fits the bill perfectly.This fan is a great size for travel and is very well made. I love the soft cloth blades. It folds up for easy storage too. It's cheaper than a sleep sound generator and you get the bonus air circulation."
1,Junk,"When I first purchased this fan, it was great for my needs. I had it sitting on my desk and it shot out just enough air to cool my face. I found no difference between the two speeds, I just always kept it on high. I purchased this fan in April, by the 1st of November it was completely dead. Nothing. I would not buy this product again.JEP"
1,Broke Quickly - Warranty Useless,"Fan was exactly what I was looking for - very quiet. However, after four months of occassional use, the fan died on me -- couldn't be restarted. I tried to use the warranty, but the cost of shipping was prohibitive. Note that several other reviewers had similar problems.Great idea - if Vornado makes a more durable version I'd buy a new one in a second. But a fan that doesn't last more than four months is a waste of money."
1,Horrible. Do not buy.,"This is a terrible product. It is compact and quiet. However, it is almost entirely ineffective AS A FAN: It moves a perposterously small amount of air. The people at Vornado should be ashamed of themselves for wasting our time and money."
4,Album and dj are excellent,But I have not received my vinyl.I advise no one to buy the importcds.I have a website that I comment on vinyl editions:devoltaparaovinil.blogspot.com.br
2,...I've heard this before,"Apparently Mr. Benassi fell off the boat to the island of new ideas... From the thumping basslines to the over vocoded vocals this album seems to be the same old thing you would expect to hear from Benassi. If your looking for variants of ""Satisfaction"" well my friend, your in luck. The only difference from it to this is minor chord changes and slighty differnt lyrics. I was really hoping for something different but instead I was let down hard. The tracks are catchy but again, it's almost like they only know how to make 4 different sounds. Hopefully the next album release will be fresh and different but with the same energy that the single ""Satisfaction"" had. Try it for yourself, maybe with the money they can buy some new equipment."
5,AMAZING,"i just got this cd and i love it is absolutley amazing, i like the vacals and the music behinde it benassi is wonderfull"
1,This Company & product is 100% awful,"First of all let me say that I utilize Amazon all the time, they have great products at great prices....however the Euducation Station, Inc. is absolutely without question the most incompetent, unreliable & sarcastic company I have ever dealt with via any of the sites such as Amazon I have dealt with. The pointer came in a huge box in newspaper IN HALF!!!!! I immediately called the Education Station & talked to what sounded like a ""CLOWN"", I told him that we received the product & it was damaged beyond repair...he assured me that they would ship out the very next day a new one...I have yet to receive it or a refund!! To say that I am dissatisfied is an understatement! I am livid!! DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS SUPPLIER, EVER!!! I will continue to utilize Amazon for now, but this is someone they allow to sell via their site & that causes great concern."
2,The tip is cheap,"The length is what I expected. The tip, however, is awful. It is hard plastic which does not make a nice sound when hitting the board. The tip also came off after about a week. I had to super glue it back on. Overall, it's very cheaply made."
3,A competitive product would be welcome,"The product is very cheaply made. We would be willing to pay more for something better. The wood on one of the two we bought had a dark, rough knot and the rubber tip was loose and did not fit well. That being said, all of the wood pointers I found online seemed to be the same product."
2,It broke too easily.,"On the second day my daughter played with it, the tip broke off. With the frayed wood, that would easily splinter into her, I had to throw it away. I just think if the end the pointer is inserted in was mad a little stronger, it wouldn't have broken as easily."
4,best value for useful info,"I have recommended this to several beginner sock knitters. The instructions are goof-proof. Straight forward and spelled out clearly, it is a great resource for those who want to learn the basics. If you can knit, purl, and pick up stitches, you can learn sock knitting from this book. It was also my first dpn project, and now I use them frequently and fearlessly.The patterns are nice. They are all for women, and they can be a bit snug (I'm an 8 1/2 regular), but you'll end up with some nice socks and new techniques when you are done. Her directions for the kitchener stitch are really good."
1,Save Your Money,"I wasn't impressed with the pamphlet, the pictures are in b/w and it wasn't very helpful. I would've been better off printing something from the web.Please note not a BOOK!!"
5,Makes sock knitting easy!,"This book takes the mystery out of knitting socks; the instructions are clear and easy to follow. The patterns are cute, and are easily altered once the basics are mastered"
2,All OK except the heel lessons,"I liked the variety of patterns for socks that are included, but the instructions are lacking. There is more space devoted to knitting and purling than turning the heel. For knitting socks, the heel/gusset area seems like the most difficult part to understand, and only a couple sentences were included. So, if you already know how to do this step, this booklet would be great, but if you are truly learning how to knit a sock, this probably isn't for you."
3,Better for the more advanced knitter,"This book is not the best for the first-time sock knitter. The patterns are a bit more advanced and not appropriate for someone who wants to knit socks for the first time. Cute patterns, but more difficult that ""learning"" to knit socks."
4,Knit socks for today's world,Very pleased with LEARN TO KNIT SOCKS. It's great to see knitting with today's fashions in mind. Keep on knitting!!
4,Learn to Knit Socks,"I had good turn around in getting this book. The book is good, I'm just having a hard time digesting some of it. I will master it tho. ThanksNorma Nichols"
2,Nice for a few months only,This item was only good for a few months. Step by step the strings detached. I contacted the seller a couple of times within the last 2 weeks- no reply. Poor customer service! Bad product. Will not buy from them again.
3,Strange movie with one . . .,"Strange movie with one redeeming value - this three disc set includes 'The Secret Glory', which is the story of Otto Rohm and his pursuit of the Holy Grail - a pursuit which comes to the attention of the Third Reich leaving him with the unfortunate circumstance of receiving a recruiting offer that he can not refuse . Part Scientist, part Occultist and in no way prepared for the Politics of dealing with an Organization he can never possibly understand or comply with . He finds himself being offered the oppurtunity and financial support he never would have had on his own but with perilous strings attached . Worth buying just to get this disc . Elegantly and hauntingly filmed with an eery backdrop on screen while subtitled in English throughout (the interviews are in German, French and English but with heavy German accents - making the subtitles necessary) . This second disc in the three disc set is well worth seeing ."
1,Dismal,"This movie has no redeeming value. Mediocre skiing on terrible snow. Frozen suncups and runneled South American Cement. The whole concept is ""Solitaire"" which suggests people traveling solo in the mountains. Nope,they're in groups.As a ski-mountaineer, I understand that the mountains offer much beyond great skiing. I did not expect a Travis Rice video with the best riders doing the best tricks on the best snow. Adventure and overcoming hardships are wonderful and inspiring topics in a ski movie. An example would be Kyle Miller's Freerider. ""Solitaire"" is a collection of random shots in the mountains of South America with no context. Perhaps there are inspiring stories behind what the people in this movie are skiing, but you'd never know it. The epic-sounding Spanish narration has no real content.Its a shame because Sweetgrass put out ""Last Light,"" a short ski movie on youtube, that is the best ever made.Don't waste your time or money!!!!"
3,Not what I ordered,"The company did not send what was pictured. Not very happy! Company would take the itme back, but don't have the time to waste, that is why I ordered over internet in the first place. Ended up keeping the item."
4,A good book for industrial automatic control,"A good book for who works in the area of industrial automation and for students who want a complete source of information about that matter. Among its special features, I found a good qualitative explanation for the on/off, P, PI, PD and PID modes of control, showing the physical process that occurs behind each one. It also develops a good theory about the work principles of some measure instruments and sensors. However, although this book covers almost everything in industrial automatic control, it is very brief in commenting some aspects to which more attention should be given. Perhaps the new edition is better than this one. In a few words, if want to have the practical sense of automation and control, this is a good one. But if you want a precise description for every phenomena, look for a book turned to Control Theory."
4,Riding Suspense,"An excellent book for delving into history as a read-aloud story for fifth graders, or for independant reading for more mature readers. Francie has a mystery begging to be solved. Critical information she uncovers could enable her family to preserve both part of the great sequoia forest and her sister's memory. The quickly moving and suspensful plot will make the book popular with boys and girls who enjoy nature, histroy, and mysteries. The historic references are easily accessible, and the author includes a glossary and epilogue that provides the actula historic backround that inspired the tale."
5,Still Relevant and Applicable Advice,"My copy of this book has a 2005 copyright date still making it five years old. Though much has changed in the ensuing years, the QuickStep Digital Photography book is extremely helpful and easily understandable. An advanced photographer might not find much of interest here, but for a perpetual novice like myself a wealth of knowledge is available between the covers.Sahlin explains the basics of photography and digital cameras here. There's even extensive tutoring for Photoshop Elements here, still useful for those with a current version.I like the clear graphics, the repetition, and the concise explanations here. This one is a keeper, whether you buy this older edition or an updated one. I've read lots of digital photography books and this one ranks highly."
5,Tremendously Helpful,"This book will be tremedously helpful to the beginning or intermediate digital photographer. It covers taking and editing images and explains complicated procedures clearly and concisely. It is an attractive book, copiously illustrated in color to make its points. I bought it based on two reviews (thank you, reviewers) and I wanted to add my positive comments. You can't go wrong with this book for adding useful information to your knowledge of digital photography and it is certainly priced right!"
5,Nomar is Awesome!,"Nomar is awesome. I'm a HUGE fan and when I got this book I didn't think I'd be learning too much more than I already knew, but I did. This is a great fact book and I'm looking forward to many more Nomar books. GO SOX!"
4,it's a great read about one of the best players in baseball.,High 5 is a good book that explains all about one of the most exciting players in baseball today. Through text and pictures it gives a complete story on who Nomar is and why he plays the game he loves so much.
2,Won't cut butter,My first Zerol ice cream scoop cut through hard ice cream and made nice round scoops. This one doesn't melt the ice cream and it's no better than a regular scoop for scraping off the top of the tub.
4,A good mathematical introduction,"This book is really very useful for anybody who is interested in modern mathematical presentation of the General Relativity. It is a pity that the role of Hilbert's variational principle is underestimated -- look into a small book by Utiyama and you find a very elegant consize derivation of the Schwarzschild solution. R.Wald is wrong when he says that Friedmann has given the solution only for the closed Universe. In his second paper in 1924 (Z. Phys., 12, 326) A.Friedman has found the open, hyperboloid Universe, so ALL the solutions in Table 5.1 are rightfully referred to as Friedmann ones."
4,Daunting at first...,"The book starts out well and then quickly becomes a refresher in topology! Not a great first text on general relativity if your higher math is shakey but as it progresses it becomes easier to read. Stable, concise, an exceptional work full of wonderful graphs, equations, and description.Not for the beginner or the merely curious, this is a book for the serious student pursuing relativity in context of astrophysics, cosmology, or some similar discipline."
2,Fair,"If you like the formal and dry, boring style of a graduate level mathematics textbook, this is the book for you, if not look elsewhere. I found Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler to be a much better book than this one. MTW takes a more physical approach and is much more interesting reading. MTW is also very good at introducing concepts like one forms and tensors in general to the uninitiated student. If you read Wald, you are better off already having a good grasp of differential geometry. My suggestion for learning GR is MTW supplemented by D'Inverno and Schutz."
1,Cookie Lady,The boxes came wrapped in a flimsy plastic wrap which was torn and thus the white bakery boxes were filthy. I have to throw them away. I will not be ordering anything else from this company.
3,Not the best of sonny and brownie,"Having heard these two in concert and owning a couple of their LPs 30 years ago, I wanted to hear them again. Sadly, this compilation isn't their best."
4,Still young,enjoyable reading. good tips for staying healthy and vigorous. informative without too much information. Not at all preachy or padantic about health issues. Unlike Dr OZ
4,"Book Review ""Younger Next Year""",A friend recommended reading. The book has many good points we all know.But a new look at some we don't.Would recommend reading
3,I wanted to punch the car speakers,"The half of the book written by Chris Crowley is the non-scientific human color side, meant to relate to the audience personally and to be a funny motivator. Often Crowley's portions are irritating enough, he can come off as arrogant and cloying, but when they hired this super corny voice actor to read Crowley's portions they created a perfect storm. Whenever a line with a bit of punch or exaggeration comes the voice actor goes over the top and contorts his voice like a movie advertisement guy on crack. It is I N C R E D I B L Y annoying and left me over and over wanting to punch the speakers in my car.Other than that there is a ton of wisdom and helpful information here, if you can deal with Crowley's writing being read by the most annoying voice in the world then you will very likely benefit from the material."
5,"Younger Next Year: Live Strong, Fit, and SexyUntil You're 80 and Beyond","This is an amazing book full of good sense and very humorous and easily readable. Every time you read it you find new ideas and are re-inspired. I can honestly say I am fitter now at 65 than I was at 50 and enjoying the program as well. John, Auckland New Zealand"
5,If you are over 50 you will find this book fascinating,"I found this book, recommended by my doctor (he tells all his patients over 50 to buy it), completely changed my mental approach to excercise. I went from a once a week excerciser to once a day.Illuminating, funny, NOT LIKE YOUR NORMAL HOW TO BOOKS. Written by New Yorkers who are sympathetic to those who feel they can squeeze by in life without excercise.I NEVER thought I would excercise like this, but I am a convert."
5,Great Encouragement,"I'm a 58 year old ""heart patient"" with a pacemaker due to irregular heartbeat. I've worked out for over 20 years 7 days a week, including 20 miles per week running and 3 days per week weight training. I am able to perform at levels of people many years younger. I've been told by family members, including 2 doctors, that I shouldn't do that.I'm reading this book for the second time. It validates what I've been doing all these years. Yet it challenges me to do more. If you want to look and feel years younger, you need to get this book; read it, live it, and enjoy the fruits of your labor. It won't happen overnight but instead in tiny daily increments. You can't go wrong. It's never too late to start.We can't change the fact that we're ALL going to die. However, we can choose to live healthy, postone death as long as possible, and decide how gracefully we age."
5,Really!,"Best book I ever read about lifestyle. Even applicable for us living outside US, health problems is the same over the globe.Thank You!"
2,easily reduced to one page,a good reminder to exercise . . . but a waste of pages and pages of ridiculous talk about our ancestral apes and how they exercised! The bulk of the book was junk . . without any reasons given for exercising. I would have loved to know what possible science or health studies are behind the benefits of exercising . . . but all they gave was that our great-great-..-great-grandfather ape hunted and gathered. What junk !!!
1,Excessively long and obvious,"I agree with several of the other reviewers. This book could easily be condensed into a 10 page health and fitness magazine article--about things we already know. I don't need 300 pages to tell me to eat well and exercise. If you're one of those people who needs someone patting you on the back saying ""You can do it!!"", you may like this book."
3,A good pamphlet,"Good information in this book, but could have been conveyed in a fraction of the pages"
2,Too wordy with little meat,"Was highly recommended by a friend, was really disappointed to read as the author tried hard to fill up the pages with humor and other unrelated verbiage to give book some shipping weight. The salient points could have been communicated in an article vs. a book."
5,Good enough for me,"I heard the author interviewed on radio and decided that it had to be a fun, informative read. I was not disappointed. It could have been a shorter book, but I really needed the reinforcement of some of the repetitive info.I've bought copies to give to my friends and family. I guess you can't do much better than that."
4,Important message but long on the delivery,"I can't say more about the authors message in this book on staying fit and healthy in the final third or life. And I normally would have given this book 5 stars but this 300 page book could have been trimmed to 100 without losing anything important. If you want a casual and entertaining read, this is your book. If you just want the facts, your going to need to skim and will be a little frustrated at the long winded delivery. The worst part is if you want to adopt the advice, all the important nuggets of information on what to do and how not to get hurt are buried throughout the book so it's hard to find them again. This book should be read with a pen so you can highlight the stuff you want to remember.But if you're 50 and not working out six days a week, eating good foods, and living with purpose then you do need to read this book anyway."
2,"Yadah. yadah, yadah","Easy, fast reading but hundreds of pages to say what could have been said in five. But then that's how many clever authors make their money: take a few pages and fluff them up until you've got enough to sell them for $30 or so."
3,A test of your focus,"I rated this three stars. The subject was worthy of five but the writing was only worth one. These authors shouldn't quit their day job. The message was good and worth while. Excursive a lot more. Eat smart. Love often. But come on guys, hire a ghost writer and publish a book people will be captivated by. I was bored stiff with all the wasteful stories very quickly, but I wanted to hear the message so I kept on reading. We got it for free and for that price, it was okay. If you paid anything, you got gipped!"
1,No scientific basis referenced,"Although this book claims to derive its content from scientific studies, there are actually no scientific references provided. Worst, a Medline search about the authors reveals no published peer-reviewed research under their names. Their theory, thus, has not undergone the scrutiny of the scientific process and this book should simply be considered as expressing the personal opinions of the authors."
4,Exercise More,"This book made me realize that I need to step it up and exercise more. As in 6 times a week instead of 2 or 3. I'm a decade away from the demographic the book was intended for but it is never too early to start taking care of yourself. Lastly, purchase the heart monitor the book suggests. Without it, your're winging it. It's better to know if your are getting the workout you need."
4,For men 50+,"Good read for men nearing retirement, who need a kick in the butt to get their act together, so they can enjoy and actually live their golden years."
4,Good read to shake you up for positive change,An easily read book with some fun stories and helpful science to guide you to the right kind of habits to achieve a higher state of fitness and wellness. I liked the interplay between the two authors and although I would have liked to have read more about the science of being younger next year I thought overall it was well balanced. This is not the first fitness and healthy eating book I have read but in my opinion it rates highly amongst books of that genre.
2,Simplistic Platitudes,"If Reader's Digest is your thing you'll love this book...simply written fatherly ""advice"". No great insights to be found. Disappointing reading."
3,Smoke gets in your eyes,"The book arrived in a timely fashion and was in excellent condition. It smelled, and still smells, like it had been stored in a humidor. It smells like fresh, unburned tobacco. It's not an unpleasant smell to me, but it would be cause for return from someone else."
5,A Great Book!,"A ""guy at the gym"" told me that this book changed his life- and so I bought it to find out why. The authors recommend that men over 50 engage in serious exercise six days a week- but promise that doing so will stop and even reverse the physical deterioriation that starts to set in ever so gradually as men age. The authors base their recommendations on some recent scientific research and their own observation. The writing style is concise and encouraging- even inspirational- and their recommendations are very straight-forward and uncomplicated. I started following their program six months ago, and have to say that I think I look and feel better. I'm recommending it to other men my age, and I'm also recommending that personal trainers who work with older guys need to read it, too, to get a better understanding of their customer's concerns and needs."
5,life Changing Read,If you are feeling old get this book. It will give you hope again. What a great job by the authors. Not anonther inter-personal babble book. This book is full of facts that will help you enjoy life again. I am going to the gym and feeling much younger. Was always active until I was told at 53 I had cancer and 18 months to live. It was a mistake but really affected me mentaly. This book got me out of the self-pity hole I had dug for myself and back to living life again. I don't usualy get so excited by a book. I have bought a copy for my 60 year old brother and 74 year old neighbor. Both of them feel the same way.
2,Re:Younger Next Yesr,"This book has got a lot of hype and I was intrigued by the title. Unfortunately, the content is very basic and redundant. It might be a primer for someone uneducated in health awareness. For me, it was a disappointment."
3,Interesting if you can stomach the evolutionary BS,It has been long known that exercising is good for you. This book drills that message home. I found it somewhat entertaining but also found the constant references to evolution to be very disappointing and I consider that portion total and utter BS. Still worth $5 though.
3,Ordered a used book. satisfied with book condition and timely delivery.,"I ordered a specific book, and was offered a used book at a lower price, much lower. Even could pick good or fair condition. I picked good and got a paperback in excellent condition. Shipping was misleading. Least expensive said delivery maybe up to 20 days, and then for maybe twice as much could get in 3-4 days. Suspecting they were the same, I went for the slow delivery, and sure enough, it showed up in 3 or 4 days. This to me looked like a misleading way to improve profit on the book."
4,"good book, but....","The information and advice on staying young were great, but....beware, you must get past their clearly biased theology of the billions and billions of years evolution process and darwinism that they hold to."
2,Darwin to extreme,"I am sure the book comes to some some great heath tips, but I didn't get that far. The one author brags in the first chapters about the other who is his doctor. I finally start getting to some meat and find that the Dr. believes I have evolved from multiple other organisms and this is why my body reacts to food and exercise the way it does.Not being a believer in Darwinian Evolution, I found this all pretty hard to swallow. While I still have intentions to finish reading the book, I haven't touched it since Christmas.If you believe that your brain has three different parts that are remnants of your less evolved ancestors, you will like the book.No kidding, I haven't ever read anything that is so geared towards outrageous evolutionary claims."
5,Great Book!,"I love this book. It provides motivation and acts as a reference. Chris Crowley is funny, sincere, and pushy (in a good way), while Henry Lodge provides insight into the mechanisms of how our bodies work; and you don't have to be 50 years old to read it. Actually, you shouldn't wait until you're 50. The longer you delay in understanding how your body works and making these life changes, the more critical it is when you finally do."
5,Life changing book...if you can follow it's advise,"I've ussally don't like this kind of health nut book., but something about the couple of except pages sounds interesting. but this is one of the best I've ever read. (not really saying much there)This is interesting , it talks about how and why people age. and how exercise at certain level will work. I took the advise and joined a gym. exercise 5 times a week. If nothing else, I'd surprise myself with what I'm capable now vs 6 weeks ago.I'd like it so much , I bought 5 books and gave it to family and friends and the ""for women"" version for my wife.This book is for everybody that is serious about a change. and for people that were at one time or another in their life an active person.If you were never an active person. it might just completely go over your head.The target audience is for retirees, I'm 43 and find out if I start to do all those things now, I'll be way ahead of the curve!"
3,Makes sense!,"My daughter-in-law, who is in marvellous shape and very health oriented, suggested this book. It has excellent ideas for staying healthy and yea, even improving, with every year."
4,Less of Chris would be more,"When I first started reading this book I was tempted to throw it away - but hang in there! I actually liked this book very much and found the premise very believable. The problem at the start is that one of the co-authors, Chris Crowley, goes way overboard preaching the need for exercise. (If you haven't already heard about that you really need to get a life.) When Dr. Lodge takes over - they pretty much alternate chapters - the book starts to get very interesting and his theories are well presented and very plausible. If you know someone who is aging and spending all of his/her time sleeping or watching TV this book might save their lives. For that reason I give it 4 stars even though some of the repetition and tongue-in-cheek by Crowley gets annoying."
5,Younger Next Year,"Probably the best I have read in 10 years. It has changed my life. I am on a second reading. No guarantees, but if you commit to following the advice in this well written common sense approach to living, chances are high that you will live a longer and better quality of life. I have purchased a number of copies and are giving them as gifts to my friends......even one to my chiropractor."
5,"Chris and Harry provide the first step to your ""FITNESS COMEBACK""","This is where your fitness comeback starts. Authors Chris and Harry translate the latest physiology science into a meaningful and motivating foundation for creating a life-long fitness habit. My wife and I have read most of the books out there, and this is the one that really got us moving. Lock yourself up for a weekend and read it straight through with a highlighter. You'll end up on Monday as a changed person, finally understanding WHY you need to exercise.See my Amazon Listmania list of other items, ""Fitness Comeback Essentials,"" to help along your new journey. Here's the link: http://www.amazon.com/Fitness-Comeback-Essentials/lm/R34N1SS9ZS5MBZ/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full"
3,liked younger,liked this book enjoyed the science by the Dr. more than the gung ho parts by the lawyer.will probably follow the diet advice but not sure about six days of workouts per week
4,Helpful,"The book was not deeply scientific but helpful in its homey way. Worth a read, particularly for those approaching retirement."
4,A great motivator,"Younger Next Year deals with what we all know: we need to eat better and to exercise more. However, this book alerts us that we need more exercise than we may think if we want to remain active into our 80's and beyond. This is not another book listing the workouts we need to be doing every day--it describes what the body needs and the stimuli to which it reacts, without burdening the reader with a list of workouts. Everyone over 40 should read this book."
3,Too Much Repetition and Very Boring in Spots,"I purchased this book upon recommendation from a friend. Although the authors say this is not an exercise book, it really is. Most of the book is devoted to advice about having a strong exercise regimen - 6 days a week. I believe the advice is good but, come on guys, we have been hearing the same advice for 30 years now. I did not learn anything new from this book - I have always had a regular exercise regimen of some sort - and got rather tired of the seemingly repetitive major thread regarding vigorous, regular exercise and its benefits. I do agree with the authors' encouragement to have a regular exercise regimen to prolong the quality of our lives as we age instead of looking at retirement as a lazy retirement from life."
5,Best Fitness Book I've Read in Ages,"This is the best fitness book I've read in ages. Actually, I listened to it as an audio book. The readers make this a real entertaining and life-altering listening experience. It's funny, informative and motivating. I give it my highest recommendation. Basically, it is co-authored by a doctor and a 70 year-old retired lawyer. Together, they deliver a convincing and potent message of how you can halt decay of your body as you get older. Instead of wasting away in a nursing home with a walker, you can be skiing in Tahoe at the age of 70. It really is a choice, as detailed in this book. They explain how to give your body the right signals for this to happen based on emerging medical findings.I've read many health and fitness books and I have a pretty good intellectual understanding of the concepts, but this book really put it all together for me in a way that has forced me to make a choice. Buy it as the audio CD and I guarantee you'll agree with me."
3,Some warnings,"In many ways, this book is important, and I recommend reading it. It contains some valuable insights I've not seen treated before, such as Lodge's physiological hypotheses concerning the balance between bodily decay and repair, which he posits as a lifelong ballet that determines who lives, who dies, and when. Crowley's contributions, however, are deeply troubling. As a macho 70-year-old, obviously proud of his athletic prowess, he continually recommends athletic activities that are unlikely to appeal to most women or to more than about 15% of the male population that enjoys and excels at sports, or that wants to develop some ""abs and pecs of death."" He gives some other very bad advice as well, which you can read about on my website, [...]"
2,Half Good,"About half of the program was informative and interesting by a guy with some real credentials (Harry). The other half was very boring, being lectured to by a pompous wind bag (Chris) bragging about how great he is and in such great condition for a man of his age. I should get half of my money back."
5,Younger next Year,"probably the best book on health . Specially interesting, not only in content, but also in the very clear and persuasive form. I am 80 years old, in good form, but even so there are many suggestions applicable to me."
1,Crudely Written,"I bought the book to learn more about my body as I age and to prepare my body for the years ahead. But, I found that the authors are crude and often times gross in their writing. Their gutter vulgarity is not entertainment and by all means does not help a reader learn about his need for exercise. The whole book is a celebration of the authors' egos and lack of communication skills. Finally, the authors' attempt to educate the readers gets lost in their rambling and the many nonsense events in their lives THEY believe pertinent to keeping one's body fit."
1,Younger Next Year,The content is to exercise hard six days a week and little more presented in a smug and slightly condescending tone.
1,Basis of the book is a story and off on many scientific facts,"This book and audio CDs are more about making you think the author is the most perfect man in the world than anything else. He sells you his theory of Evolution, his theory of perfect life, his theory of where your mind should be and what to think so you can be just like him. Problem is he also tells you he has messed up his life. This contains very few facts and if your life's goals are not just like his, you are waisting your time and money. I did waist my time and money on this and I hated it so much I would not even give it to another person."
4,younger next year,this used book was received in good condition and the book itself met my expectations
3,Not new info,Paperback: Each page fell out of the book as I read the page. OK for motivation to start a program. The new-age pseudo-science is boring.
5,Maybe not what you want to hear but....,"Yep, you need to exercise pretty regularly. Otherwise you start getting decrepit. This book helps inspire the necessary actions in a fairly matter of fact but entertaining way. It is not a how to book but more geared towards motivation and how not to screw up your life. One thing it does miss though is the need for stretching to prevent injury. I still give it five stars since the message is pretty spot on."
4,I Hope That This Works!,I bought this book for my husband and myself and we have both read it. It is very interesting to read the words of an ordinary person in one chapter followed by the doctor in the next chapter. The ideas and suggestions are very good and not overwhelming.
5,Game Changer,This book should be required reading for everyone over 30! It certainly has changed my life. There aren't a lot of new concepts; most of the ideas a reader probably intuitively knows. Authors Chris and Harry present the information dynamatically and this reader couldn't waid to jump into the game.
2,Not working right,We tried to use this for our lecture capture system but the video was dark. We replaced it with a different one.
5,"Distributer, Amplifier, Video Spliter","Works just fine.Splits video signal between my computer monitor and HDTVSince i got it, never had a problem.Recomended."
2,VGA Splitter,"Very disappointed in this device...mainly because it degrades the signal quality significantly. It might be of use for Powerpoint displays on multiple small VGA monitors, but it's not suitable at all for HIGH DEF displays. IMO."
3,Amusement Park Mania,"I have read this book, much to my delight. The historical section reviewing roller coasters is excellent for this 4th to 7th grade reading level book. But do not let you think that it is only for school children. Adults will enjoy this quick read, too.The pictures are excellent and are well supported by the text. The web links are dated, but not crucial to the understanding of the book.The only reason why I do not rate this book higher is that in the physics of roller coasters section, there are serious errors in the science (pages 32-34). In particular, inertia, momentum, and energy are used incorrectly. Later in the book when discussing seat position for maximum g's, there is also an error.Aside from the scientific errors, though, I would recommend this book and am happy that I have my own copy."
1,Look Inside says it all,"Part of a series called Look Inside, this book offers little else. Factual content does exist, although in scattered and fragmented form. There is little flow to the information presented and it is mostly separated into boxes and arrows identifying an explanation for a picture. The book is divided into thirteen sections, each a two-page spread with text, photos and drawings. There is also a glossary, list of further readings, and a pictoral table of contents depicting the tomb as a whole. The pictures are of good quality and are plentiful, making the series true to its name. One usually hopes for text of the same quality however. Seems like an inferior copy of the Eyewitness series, which offer more text, more pictures, and more pages."
5,Amazing.,"I purchased these wine glasses for my mother for Christmas 2011. I was expecting ""unbreakable"" glasses to be substantially thicker, but these glasses are whisper thin and are absolutely gorgeous. They feel like a MUCH more expensive glass, and wine tastes amazing out of them. As far as the unbreakability goes - she's had them for 3 months and one hasn't broken yet!HIGHLY recommended."
1,MOST Breakable glasses we've ever owned plus $9.95 per stem replacement cost,"Two of the three boxes I ordered at Christmas arrived with SHATTERED glasses. The customer service is good. They quickly replaced the broken glasses in time for Christmas. Within the first 3 weeks of use (careful wash by hand use) two more broken glasses. One broke in my mother in law's hand. (I was rather horrified.) So of the 12 glasses that I bought in 6 weeks of use 5 have broken. Now here is the really good part. When you read the fine print, the company is happy to replace the broken glasses for $9.95 a stem."
5,Lovely Paper Dolls,"I reccetly bought these paper dolls and I love them. The designs of the dolls and the outfits are really beautiful. One of the things that I enjoyed was the small biography of each wife by their doll. This is a must have for any fan of the Tudor era, I also loved these dolls so much that I had decided to get the paper doll set of Queen Elizabeth I of England."
5,awesome,i have an older dell latitude and after installing this my laptop responded like it had just eaten a can of spinach. great value and highly recommended!
5,Worked as expected,"No problems upgrading. Worked right away, as expected, since the specs were exactly the ones I needed."
3,"80% HISTORICAL & 20% ""HOW-TO""","This is just an outstanding reference on knife fighting. It is a historical overview and technical look at employment of all the classic methods as developed by Fairbairn, Applegate, Sykes and others. This book does a good job in balancing the critical and relevant matter of the techniques with the historical information, making this the ideal book for the novice and expert in bladecraft. This book covers the famous and influential blade masters of the time, their techniques, tools of the trade and finally tactics for the knife fighter. This book is by no means the best ""how-to"" book on the market but it was never meant to be strictly a ""how-to"" book. It is clearly and intelligently written, as well as clearly illustrated. Overall for historical study this book is highly recommended. I personally do not agree with many of the methods depicted in this book, but this does not make this book any less worth studying for the professional combatives enthusiast."
1,Not recommended.,"I did not like this book, and of all the books I've acquired pertaining to this subject, it is one of the few I've actually discarded. Sure, it'd be cool to have a title like ""The Complete Book of Knife Fighting"" on my shelf, if just to round out my collection . . . but I have limited shelf space, and this text is not only substandard, but it failed to amuse me.On Mr Cassidy's behalf, I will allow that the original printing was from the 70's, making this one of the very first books on the subject (barring WWII combatives manuals, which it borrows heavilly from). If you're a collector, this is an essential text; but if you want to LEARN, you really need to look elsewhere. Much has been written on the subject since."
3,Introduction to the Knife culture.,"The original publication in 1975 was ahead of its time on publications relating to this topic. To date there are many books written on ""knife fighting"" most of them junk, by authors who's only knowledge about edged weapon training is from some time spent in a dojo or reading some other uninformed author. This book outlines the forefathers of close quarter combat with knives and writes about their contributions to this warrior art. The book gives an above average curriculum for training with knives for defense as well as offense. It will serve well as a primer on the topic. As of yet, I can not recommend any one book as the best on this topic..."
3,Kaleidoscope the Cat toy,"We bought this toy for our Grand-daughter's birthday. It was MUCH smaller than what we ALL thought it was going to be. But she likes it any way, and that's all that's important."
1,Picture is misleading,The picture of this product is misleading. What I received the posts were on the bottom instead of onto and they are more a greyish metal and not the pretty silver.The shape was even different. They looked horrible on the ears as well.
3,A fun introduction to textual criticism,"As a novel, this is not especially well written. It is definitely on the hokey side (flat characters, cheesy romance, etc.). However, it is a fun way of being introduced to the issues of New Testament textual criticism (i.e. determining the original wording of a given passage in the Bible when the underlying Greek manuscripts disagree)."
4,The Scribes by Peter Rodgers,"I found this Novel very interesting and difficult to put down! Truthfully I found a few sections early on in which the writing was a bit unclear,however, overall it was well written and the story line intriguing. The writer did a great job using the genre of Historical Mystery Adventure to impart knowledge of the Ancient world, to his readers as well as its languages bringing clearly into focus the Scribal codes and traditions used in Biblical transmission. Dealing well with issues, pertinent to both ancient and modern worlds."
3,"Very interesting, but the blending of styles was a little awkward at times","First off, I have to say that I did enjoy this book. The sense of conviction the characters had in their beliefs and mission, the inner turmoil caused by having their convictions challenged by very real situations, and the historically legitimate portrayal of the culture surrounding the first century church all made this a really nice read. I did struggle at times with feeling like the story turned into a textbook, especially in the first half. And I found myself longing for the return to character dialogue and expression when the story seemed to get a little distracted with just telling scene setting facts in a short and clipped style. But I would still recommend it to anyone willing to plod through it and consider the historical support for our belief in the legitimacy of Scripture."
2,The Scribes,Fair read. Moved slow. Lot of discussion about which translation was correct and keeping the Bible pure as the Apostles wrote it. Probably about right for the 2nd century. Their faith and knowledge of the Bible was encouraging. How they quoted scripture for the different situations they found themself in was a testimony to their faith.
4,Good music!,"I bought this CD after hearing Michael sing at a bar here in NYC. He's got a great way with a ballad and some of my favorite songs are on this CD. Since they didn't list the songs above, I will.1. Words He Doesn't Say 2. Marry Me a Little (one of my favorites) 3. I Had a Dream About You 4. Sweet Dreams 5. Marking Time 6. One Private Moment 7. Storybook 8. A Dream 9. I Don't Want Know/Everyday a Little Death 10. Lullabye 11. Move On (really liked this one too) 12. And So It Goes"
5,Great introduction and reference guide,This guide works for both those new to studying herbs and those who would like a solid reference book. It is laid out in alphabetical lessons that can later serve as a quick reference index. The author actually goes beyond the herbs themselves to discuss illnesses and ailments that can be treated with natural remedies. The book makes it easy to get started studying a sometimes overwhelming topic!
4,HP zv5320us,"I just bought this notebook as a Desktop replacement. Nice machine, although it is a little bit thick.The incorrect CPU speed reported by the previous user is not a problem. The 797Mhz speed reported is a result of the AMD Powernow! capabilites of the processor. Until there is a demand it will use this setting as an idle to save power.There is a downloadable app (free from AMD), PowerNow Dashboard which will display this throttling. As far as the system reporting the correct CPU speed, you can get it to report 1.6GHZ if you choose XP power meter settings of ""Home/Desktop"" and rebooting. This creates a ""non-throttle"" condition and the CPU reports the full 1.6GHZ processor speed. This also is confirmed by the Powernow Dashboard program showing 100% CPU."
1,Almost perfect,"Great screen, battery life, nice keyboard, wireless is perfect.BUTThe CPU will not run faster than 797MHZ on the one I bought, and HP admitted it is a flaw. They claim a BIOS fix will solve the problem and the fix will be available ""soon"" - I would wait until the problem is fixed befor buying this otherwise very nice machine."
4,IT ROCKS!!,"Its an awsome game you can do the most cool roller coasters!!!!If your not a rollercoaster lover like me you will still like this game,I love it!"
5,Wow!,"I have been waitin for 6 months for this to come out. I admit, this game was easy, i am very good at building coasters. Unfortately i paid too much for it. If you like building coasters this is the game for you. I beat it in 2 and a half days but i still play the secret level often, but once you beat the game there is not much left to do. But on the other hand this game rocks. Graphicwise and gameplaywise. But i would pay more than ... bucks for it because it is not worth it."
1,COASTER WORKS = =<,"If your are ready to be disapointed buy this game. I would give it a ZERO STAR but it only lets me pick one. 6 boring levels, that take no time at all to beat is all you have to pick from. First of all price is HIGH, Second square graphics, Third there is really no thema to the game, you dont see a person in the seat of the coaster the whole game, forth IF you expected roller coaster tycoon (like me) IT is not there at all. Thats the main reasons and there are many more. BUY IF YOU DARE but be prepaired to have no fun"
1,It doesn't work.,"This cable didn't work as expected to connect my son's cell phone to his computer. The software it come with didn't work, so the cable didn't work."
2,cable did not work,the cable usb i tried and did not work for my vx8100 verizoni tried couple time and cant pass info to my pc
2,Very Disappointing,"I was so excited to find pumpkin-scented incense that I ordered TWO packages of this (that's 200 hours of incense, according to the product description). There are two major things wrong with this incense:1) The package it comes in is greasy and slimy with whatever oil they use to scent the incense stick.2) When it is burning, it smells like nothing at all...just kind of like an unscented incense stick (if you can imagine...that smoky smell with no hint of pumpking whatsoever).Don't waste your money...I guess I should have been skeptical when I saw this was priced for $5.00 and there were 100 sticks :)"
1,Oh boy....Not great,"If you are looking to buy this figure because Buffy looks beautiful with her long tresses then you are sadly mistaken. The picture tells one thing but the doll is another. She has very short hair like she did in season 2. If I would have known that I would have not have spent the $45.00 on the doll. She is very articulated but can NOT stand on her own which stands to reason why it comes with a ""stand""But if that doesn't bother you then I say go buy it. Note to A Kid's Review: Buffy had long hair in season 1! Season 2 is when she had the short hair. Obviously you are not a ""Buffy fan"""
2,"Good ideas, but fails in the details","The worst part about giving this book such a low rating is that I actually agree with what Ehrlich is saying. But it was just so, so terribly written I can not bring myself to recommend this book.This book gives a good overall explanation of the population crisis, including connections to other environmental issues and what can be done on an individual basis. But, there were many times were Ehrlich made riduculous statements without citations, leading me to be suspicious about the ""facts"" in this book.For example, Ehrlich predicts a 2- to 3-foot rise in sea level in the next 50 years (131) and claimed national leaders try to appease urban citizens for fear of being ""killed by mobs"" (104). Both these statements were made without any citation or indication of source. These are just two examples of many. Ehrlich continually goes beyond the line of speculation and just plain makes things up."
3,Review on Al-Kitab fi Taallum Al-Arabiyya Juz Al-Awal,"I've used this book in my first three semesters of Arabic in College. The methodology is okay. It should be more didactic in terms of grammar. Not a bad language learning material, though, there is still a lot to be improved. There is a lot of focus on the Arab culture, this can be improved if there is more focus on explaining the grammar part of the language rather than applying it in situations a little more than required at an early stage."
3,Average quality; can be improved,"I used the last few chapters of this book to teach Arabic level 4 at Rochester Institute of Technology. It's definitely better than other books I looked at. This book, unfortunately, doesn't include ""harakat"" that would enable students to read and understand easier; I often had to supplement students with extra material. The tapes often include conversations in Egyptian dialect, though understood around the Arab world, but is basically useless. From my experience, those who learn Arabic are either interested in learning how to read the Quran, Arabic media, or get to know the culture.You are better off learning classical Arabic as every Arab understands. Dialect will only help in having conversations where this dialect is prominent."
1,My Condolences if you must use this textbook...,"It's atrocious. The native speakers in my class are struggling to get B's. As one classmate put it, ""This is Arabic for Arabs."" Very grammar intensive, not conversational/spoken language. Obviously designed for students in pricey universities who want to be CIA agents or State Dept. employees. Good for understanding Arab TV news, but that's about it.The worst thing about this book is that MANY words in the exercises are nowhere in the glossary or word lists. If you don't have a native speaker spoon-feeding you, you'll be sunk.Maybe this book would be useful for Arabic speaking homeschool Mommies who want their children to understand the classical 'fuzha' language."
1,"Unless you want to become Muslim, DON'T buy this","This is the WORST language book I've ever seen. It claims to teach you Arabic, but instead it really teaches you Islamic phrases and includes non-translated sections from the Koran for you to phonetically read (even though you have absolutely no idea what you're saying). The CD quality is terrible and it's hard to make out how the words are promounced. Also, the music is annoying, as is the chanting from the Koran.It's a lot of money to spend for such a poor book. (I would have given it a zero out of five stars, but the lowest rating was one star). There are SO many other great books on how to learn Arabic WITHOUT being forced to read the Koran, so why waste your money on this one?If, however, you DO want to become Muslim, this book's for you!!"
4,Utter Glory of Morrisey Hall CD,"The delivery and the product were excellent. It's a cute show with some good numbers. I've never seen the show or read the script, so I can't comment on its overall quality. However, as a HS drama director in need of shows with large female casts, I would consider producing this show at some point."
4,Compact square,"although it is small but can store many things almost 4 medium size lenses + the camera body and good quality built , but the only problem is that you cannot keep medium size lens attached to the camera inside the case only small lenses can be attached with some rearrangements for the interior partitions."
5,My Review,"I was surprised at how large this case is, in fact is is to large for what I wanted but am using this case anyway. I keep my Nikon 1 J1 with the zoom lense and also a Sony camcorded in it along with all the chargers and cables. It is kinda big to be carrying this on a trip like to a zoo or Disney world. It is well built and the yellow inside helps to see what is there and there are plenty of pockets for extras. I bought a smaller case to put my Nikon and batteries in so I don't have to lug the big case around all day when we stop somewhere. But I think anyone who has a lot of cameras and lenses will love this case. It says small but I would call it a medium size. But for a camera like the Nikon 1 J1 it is a little bit to large for one camera. I will update my review later after I have used it more."
4,Good for one camera,"I got this bag for my new Canon T2i camera and two lenses. It holds all of these things easily. It has multiple pockets and extra velcro space makers. I have an extra battery, battery charger, and a notebook easily stored with this bag. I think it's perfect for one camera but nothing more. Seems really great at protecting my camera as well, and I'm rather clumsy. It's well padded, very well put together, and doesn't seem cheap."
4,Good Reviews on Camera Bag,The camera bag worked out wonderfully! And I got it cheaper than the same one I found in the store.It was a very easy purchase and the product came in a very timely manner.
5,Really Nice Case,"Unfortunately, I decided to return this case because it was simply larger than I wanted to carry for my Alpha, but I was impressed enough that I felt it deserved a few comments. This is an very well designed, heavily padded, and roomy case that looks like it will last many years. By far the nicest case I've seen... I hated to send it back!"
1,Not what was explained on web site,I ordered this item to fit all my son's Mr. Potato heads and when it came it says right on it that it is for punkins and DOES NOT fit the Mr. Potato heads that we have. He was very upset as he wanted the Pirate as he has CP and plays with the one at theapry every week.
2,POWER,I like the sound but dissapointed when I opened the box and saw the 250 watt rms on the label. I understood from all the specs I could find that these were true 500 watt.
1,Low Quality,"Compared to what we had in our sub these are very cheap quality. There is no base, it doesnt have that thump we wanted at all we are returning them and spending an extra 25 to get a better speakerbut if you only wanna spend 20 they they are ok for the price just dont get your hopes to high"
2,False advertisement add says two in the picture,"False advertisement add says two in the picture, only one item, I am going to have to wait tell next month to finish my project, or at least start it, I can barely fell the base from the one speaker 6 feet away, it does help from no bass"
3,Works ONLY with standard SD cards....,Great item ONLY if your using standard SD cards....NOT SDHC. I repeat...does NOT work with SDHC cards!
3,Books,"I purchased these books for my son and I haven't seen them so I can't give a 5 review, altho my son has enjoyed reading the book. I understand that they arrived on time so that was a plus but don't about the condition of the book, altho I assume that it was described."
4,Well Constructed...do your homework,"This is by far one of the nicest shower arms I have purchased, however, the fitting is threaded on the end 1/2"" which did not match up with what was plumbed in my house. A run to the local HDW store to get a quick fit connector and a hacksaw solved the problem. I nice upgrade to a normally overlooked part of the shower. Recommended"
4,great way to make your rain shower head operate correctly,"This arm allows a rain shower head to hang down. But be mindful that if you have a bench/seat under your shower head, you may want to consider a 16"" arm, so the water falls on your head while you stand, and you can sit without while avoiding a direct hit from the water."
2,Disapointed,"The explanations are not that good, neither the drawings. Kind of blurry. I don't want to paint my pet like that, I want a book that be more precise and provide clears ideas of how to draw your pet."
3,Marc Jacobs by Bridget Foley,"A disappointing, fluffy book that fails to go into any kind of depth about the designer. On a surface, introductory level it is sufficient. But Jacobs has far more to him than what this book offers. I'll hold my breath and wait until something with greater coverage and depth comes out about this brilliant designer."
3,Not worth the Money,"I loved the style of this photo screen when I came across it on Amazon.I still love the style but it is not made to the highest standard, which I would expect considering the price.The plexiglass that covers the photos is easily scratched and the photo openings are NOT true to size.The 8x10 are actually big enough for an 11x14 print and the 5x7 openings are large as well.I was unable to find mats that would fit the 5x7 opening so I had to put black construction paper behind my prints to fill in that extra space...not quite the look I was going for.My screen is also a bit wonky so that all bases do not firmly touch the ground.I would NOT recommend buying this product for $250."
5,"Works great, absolutely love this thing","I installed the 80 GB version of this about 3 weeks ago, and absolutely love it. It took only about 15 minutes to setup and install and I was on my way. Not only does it provide a great automated backup solution for all my files (photos, videos, music, web site files) it works great for remote access and sharing. If I am at work I am able to grab files from home if I need them, and I've also been able to setup shared folders to share my photos with several other people.Not only that, it gives me peace of mind, I have had Windows crash on me a couple times in the last 2 years and I've been lucky to retrieve a lot of my stuff. Now I don't have to worry about it anymore."
5,Vratyas Vakyas is a mastermind,"If you hear the words ""Viking Metal,"" you're probably expecting something heavy and ruthless like Bathory or Amon Amarth, right? Not so from Falkenbach's ""Ok Nefna Tysvar Ty."" While its lyrics describe Odinism and the Viking conquest against those evil Christians, the music itself is very melodic and beautiful. Vocal styles get repetitive, but you lose yourself in Vakyas' fantastic voice. The ardency of the flutes, which are prevalent in this release, is the thing that will catch most listeners first. This is not to say that the guitar work is not fantastic, because while not technical or fast, it is very good. There is a lot of use of acoustic and classical guitars as well. I recommend this to any Viking Metal fan, and also to fans of Agalloch, Sol Invictus, and Opeth."
4,creates a mood,"This is one of those albums that non-metal listeners can give a listen to and say,""hey,that's some good music.""Well,in fact,it's not really metal at all.This album is more like folk music with lyrical themes about the life of yesteryear.There are some splashes of distorted guitar and screams(not too harsh)but mostly we hear acoustic guitars and all sorts of ancient sounding instruments.I'm not too sure what some of those instruments are but they definitly are a nice,fresh addition to the rest of the more familiar sounding ""rock"" instruments.The best part of this album is the amazing mood of nostalgia it just seems to create.I personally listened to it with headphones walking to the store.I swear I could tune everyone else out and I felt like I was the only around for miles in a land a long time ago.Try it."
4,Can't Be Beat At This Price,"As manager of ""The Oktoberfest Webring,"" I am always on the lookout for quality Oktoberfest products. I stand 5'8"" tall and have a 38"" waist. This one-size-fits-all costume bagged on me, so I shortened the suspenders and decreased the waist and inseam a few inches. The hat was too crumpled to be of any use. Fortunately, I already had an Alpine hat, a pair of white, over-the-calf socks, and a Bavarian tie, which was all I needed to complete this outfit. Basically, what you are getting is a pair of dark green imitation but somewhat authentic appearing lederhosen, and a pair of attached decorative suspenders (the cross-piece of which detaches on one side to facilitate getting in and out of the costume). For the money, you can't beat this outfit. Some years ago, I paid over $100 for a real pair of lederhosen, and $80 for a pair of matching leather suspenders. In retrospect, I wish I had bought this costume instead!"
5,This book should be required reading for all dog owners!,"This book has been adopted as the manual for many obedience classes. I've been teaching dog obedience for years, and this book is my most useful tool. It expains most aspects of owning a dog, in easy to understand terms. I recommend it highly, and give it to all of my clients. The pictures are GREAT and very funny."
3,"GOOD, but not GREAT.","This is a good, basic book about dog training. Some of the insite into why dogs do what they do and what they are really thinking is great information to have. But, if you are serious about dog training it will take more than just this one book to give you all the base knowlege you need.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in dogs though. The information it has is accurate and useful and the illustrations are fun and educational. I agree with the person who said it would be a great dog training book for younger children to start with. The illustrations make this book very understandable for everyone.Add it to your collection for the pictures and basic information, but do keep reading because there are more comprehensive dog training manuals out there."
2,WHAT ALL GOOD DOGS SHOULD KNOW,"THIS BOOK WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, IT WAS NOT HELPFUL TO ME IN THE TRAINING OF A NEW PUPPY, TO SAY THE LEAST I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED."
5,One of Her Best,"I think Ruth Rendell is the best suspense writer living. If you have never read one of her books before, then prepare to be enthralled by her characters, her plot and by the fierce intelligence evident in her writing. I have read everything she has ever written and ""The Killing Doll"" is perhaps her finest work. This is not a nice, neat, cosy stereotypical English mystery. It is a story about disturbed and disturbing people who act out of desperation, loneliness and fear. You will feel pity for some of her characters and loathing for others. Their stories will remain with you long after you turn the final page."
5,Muscle Milk Light,"I've tried lots and lots of various meal replacements etc over the years, and never really found something that the kids liked (my barometers for taste), which would contain all the vitamins etc. This formula has to be the greatest taste available, and even better as it's mixed with water so can be brought on hols etc and has loads of nutrients. So yes, it's the best value around, even if it costs, none goes to waste whatsoever, and it's great for the kids too......"
5,Delicious!,"Regular Muscle Milk has lots 'o calories. Too many in my mind. I buy this stuff for me and my sons and it does a great job for post workout protein requirements. A tad on the pricey side, but the better ones are, so you just have to bite the bullet."
4,Interesting flavors,My wife rather enjoys this banana flavor quite a bit. I prefer the chocolate and chocolate peanut butter flavors myself. Can use all water or part milk to make the shakes with best results using a blending bottle.
3,"very good taste, way too many calories",The muscle milk surely has a a very good taste. It mixes well too. The reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that its inferior compared to the other protien supplements. It has way too many calories and less protien per scoop. I would recommend isopure.
1,too sweet,The powder form is too sweet. Difficult to drink. Seller did not allow me to return the product. Will not purchase again from them.
3,Good but gloopy,"This stuff tastes good, but it doesn't mix very well. Even with vigorous stirring or shaking, you're usually left with a watery concoction in which chunks of mix either float to the top, or settle at the bottom to leave you with a last doughy mouthful. I like to mix one scoop of this and one scoop of the regular Muscle Milk Cookies n' Cream(which tastes EXCELLENT, by the way; and ends up being only 50 calories more than 2 scoops of Muscle Milk Light) to facilitate mixing. This works moderately well."
2,way too sweet!,"Dissolves easily, better than other products I have tried, but it is incredibly sweet (not in a good way) from extra artificial sweetener. I had to add extra water just to make it palatable. I doubt I will be drinking this as directed (just mixed with water). I will try to make it into a smoothie with plain yogurt to try and offset the sweetness. I will try another brand next time."
1,Yuck!,"I was really hoping this would be drinkable-- I've been doing the HMR diet, and this was the closest thing I could find at a more reasonable price. I can't tell you how disappointed I was to find it tastes like aspertame and vitamins. I'm not sure how people drink this stuff. I found it disgusting. Tried both the cake batter and the chocolate. Yuck. Back to my more expensive stuff. :(If you do happen to like the taste, I will say that Amazon had the best pricing I could find, especially if you get on the recurring delivery plan. Per ounce, it far less than GNC, Walgreens, and Rite Aid. The package arrived quickly (and 2-day shipping was free, as I'm an Amazon Prime member). It was well packaged, and I had no complaints with delivery."
3,Tastes Okay,"Mixes HORRIBLY, even in a blender, there is still at least half foam. I would recommend using 2% milk instead of water, but that seems to give you the calories of a regular muscle milk. The stuff they sell at the kwik mart stores, or gas stations tastes ALOT better, and it's the same company!"
3,"Good taste, but...","To many ""extra"" ingredients. I don't know what they are, so I don't want to consume them. Switched over to Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold. It's pure protein without all of the mystery ingredients.I liked the taste of the MM vanilla better than the Optimum Nutrition, but the ON doesn't taste bad either. The ON also costs less per serving than the MM."
4,Loved the taste,I couldn't find the Muscle Milk Light Chocolate Peanut Butter at stores and ordered it online. I liked the taste but didn't like to wait for shipment. I now use Muscle Milk Light Chocolate and put a tablespoon of PB2 powdered peanut butter and it tastes even better than this.
3,Does not taste like Reeses!,I know I shouldnt expect a diet food to taste like my favorite candy...but why even try to make peanut butter chocolate if ir going to miss the mark by this much. I like the Muscle Milk Light products. They closely resemble the nutrional info of the Ideal Protein diet shakes. The IP shakes are $29 for a pack of six.... so MML is a cheaper solution for sure. But this is not the flavor to do it.
4,Mmmmmm Yum,"This is great if you like reese pieces. Very filling.Muscle milk is awesome, very affordable, and great for breakfast or a snack."
5,good protein shake,"I really like this protein shake. Since changing my eating habits and working out intensely while using this product, I lost 15 lbs and 5% body fat. It tastes pretty good, especially if you shake it up with ice cubes and cold water."
3,great taste but expensive,"Great taste, but no need to buy it online, you can find it in walgreens for the same price or cheaper."
5,"Muscle Milk, Light; Banana flavor","I love this!! One scoop is only 100 calories and will make a LARGE drink. I blend 16 oz cold water, 1 scoop Banana Muscle Milk, l banana (frozen if possible), 1-1/2 c. ice. I blend until thick, like a frosty. It is good with other fruit, too. An apple or pear is great mixed with it. It fills you up and tastes so good it is as if you are ""cheating"" on your diet!"
4,Different but...,I wasn't really sure what to expect with this product but have been pleased so far. I was buying the 100 calorie 4 packs and wanted to try this because it seemed more cost effective. The powder does taste different from the infividual bottles but after the first sip it's not bad. I only consume this drink after a good workout. I find that it does help with healthy muscle recovery and lean growth.
5,Chocolate awesomeness,"Tastes great. Good protein to carb ratio. Whey protein not soy which is good. Easy to mix, especially with the blender bottle. I probably go through the whole container in about 3 weeks so I'm considering doing the ""subscribe and save."""
5,muscle milk coast vs fastfood,if you looks at it like muscle milk is expencive theen look at it this way you are spending the same amout you spend in aweek on fastfood then it ends up working out and you are getting protien that your body need not junk that you are just killing your self with ... so all in all the coast is about the same honestly ... so me personly spending that amout of mney on protien so so much better.. and the chocolate its the best one i have found and it stays with me threw out the day so i eat less
5,Best I've found!,"I was looking for a low-calorie, less expensive protein supplement and this is it. I like to mix one scoop of the Chocolate Milk flavor (for only 100 calories) with about 12 ounces of water and 1 tsp. Kava instant coffee. Then pour over ice. It tastes like an iced mocha. I'm hooked. I really like the ""subscribe and save"" option on Amazon."
3,Cake Batter?,"I love the Muscle Milk products. I have tried the Chocolate as well as the Cookies-N-Cream. They were both good. This one good as well. However,it just didn't taste like cake batter at all to me. It had a taste that was more along the lines of butter pecan ice cream."
4,"Great product, but small container","Lighter and lower in calories than the original, yet still provides much needed protein. Takes great, and is a great product. My only complaint about this product, is that it' s half the size of the original, for almost the same price of the original."
1,"label change, corn fiber, crystalline fructose added","Reviews already posted about this personal health and muscle-building product show lots of knowledge, and i plan to read more of these reviews for the information shared.Just wanted to say the taste of this product has been terrific and over the years i've used Muscle Milk a lot and counted on the nutrition ../........However, in the small print of the list of ingredients on the new label, can't help but notice something called ""crystalline fructose.""This is a serious issue....For this reason, i guess i'll look elsewhere for nutritional support.While i wouldn't dream of telling knowledgeable users what to do, the use of crystalline fructose in this product adds nothing to the taste and (b)is a serious health issue for me.For others as well, according to recent information. Hope the manufacturers will remove the corn products from Muscle Milk .....Do you have influence to get this done?"
2,I love Muscle milk and really disliked this flavor,"I dont know if its becasue I bought the light version or what, but it really taste like crap.. get a different flavor TRUST ME"
1,Deceptive labeling,"The label on this product states 32 grams of protein.A serving size is one scoop. One scoop is only 16 grams of protein.In smaller type, that you cannot read on the web site, it states that to attain 32 grams of protein, you need to use two scoops.For that matter, why not say 64 grams of protein and use 4 scoops.Why stop there..... how about 108?If a serving is only one scoop, than that is the amount of protein that should be displayed in large font on the front of the label."
1,takes way too long to ship,"I LOVE my muscle milk, but the company took a week just to put it in the mail and then it took another week before it arrived! I'm sorry, but that is unacceptable. I will buy from another provider now."
5,Good product,"The light version is just as good as the regular with half the calories. The taste is great and doesn't clump up, like drinking a milk shake after an intense session, it's a reward!"
3,chocolate powder doesn't taste as good as ready to drink,"The chocolate powder has an odd flavor. I like the ready to drink version better. I've mixed the powder with extra water and some instant coffee, and that made it more palatable. Maybe the other flavors are better."
4,Good Protein Mix,"Good protein powder. I prefer the light to save on calories because I was not trying to gain weight, just add muscle. Mixed well and tasted surprisingly good as well."
2,"Doesn't dissolve worth a crap, doesn't taste great","This stuff will not dissolve - I hope you like drinking chunks. The taste is not great, slimfast is way better. It does claim to have a lot of protein, I can't comment on the nutrition."
4,A bargain at twice the price,"Very nice volume, rare to see gilt page edges these days.A valuable addition to my collection"
3,Frankie's Better Than This Compilation,"Okay collection of Frankie Paul tunes. His more recent tunes have lacked the powerful blend of his soulful passionate powerful voice, love lost/gain lyrics, with music that does not sound like it is backed by the same tinny drum machine (that insults his musical expression). Check deeper for 80s BBC ballads. So Soon We Change, etc. A Need for The Best of Frankie Paul still exists for fans who listen from the strings of the heart instead a mechanical assembly of tunes. Do Not Be Fooled. Frankie has greater breadth and depth that what is caputured here. Buy other cds instead of another ""fake best of"" collection. This CD is a mild diservice to his second to none stature as a reggae vocalist, still good numbers, but does not dig deep enough to convey the essence of an artist at his finest to merit ""At His Best"". Justified as a starting point for first timers. Others likely to be disappointed."
5,Leslie Kelly's BEST book,"I discovered this Harlequin author about two years ago and have read every one of her books. They're funny and sweet and unpredictable. This is my absolute favorite. In Two To Tangle (the PERFECT title for this plot), the 'wrong bed' mix up is adorable and sexy and left me with that special feeling that I am in on the ""secret"" and I couldn't wait for the characters to figure it all out. Very sexy, like all of Kelly's books, but this one has a special emotional kick and a delicious mix-up that kept me smiling all the way through. From the rainstorm to the roses, this book is a blast!"
5,sexy and LOL funny,"Although I've loved all Leslie Kelly's books, this is my favorite so far. It had me chuckling from the first page and soon laughing out loud. I fell in lust with Trent right along with Chloe, and you will too! The secondary characters are a real hoot, so I was delighted to see there will be a sequel coming soon. I can't wait to see the other twin meet his match!"
5,A Delightful Read,"TWO TO TANGLE is a sexy, delightful read. From page one to the very end, Chloe and her topsy-turvy relationship with Troy - or is that Trent - will keep you smiling."
2,After 4 months - port failed,"Pro: Exactly as described - worked great! Manually switch any USB peripheral device between two PC just by pressing button. External power source. Nice for printers or transfer info via thumb drive between PC's or onto both one at a time without having to chase USB ports on each.Con: After 4 months one of the Upstream Ports failed. Which makes it pretty useless except as a USB Hub using the one remaining Upstream Port. I've been reading alot of reviews about these switches, and keep seeing the same problem...Upstream port failure after weeks to months."
5,Great USB 2.0 device,"The reviews I read on this hub indicated it would help with peripheral devices like my scanner not working after the PC hibernates. And it does, so if that's driving you crazy this is a good solution for that."
1,Not even worth sending back,"I bought this for my daughter. The display was dead when it arrived. I took it a local jewelry counter for a new battery, and the live battery let some display show, but it was a garbled display and not able to be set or used. My daughter found a much cheaper watch at Target, with more features (a stopwatch!). This one wasn't even worth sending back!"
5,A comical cruise through photography's subculture,"It is no small feat to craft a novel about the photographic arts that includes buried treasure, terminal illness and international terrorist plots --- not to mention the Lesbo-Demons biker gang and Krishna himself. Mr. Covington has managed to deliver a rollicking story with more twists and turns than a roller coaster ride, on hallucinogens, during a hurricane. Highly recommended."
5,Lucasarts Does It Again,"As usual, Lucasarts carries on the tradition of making great games. This game has all the great qualities of it's cousin, Rouge Squadron, plus more. The fog effect has been eliminated- a major plus. Lucasarts factored in ground based missions, and level checkpoints. If you liked Rogue, you'll play this game once, and never want to go back."
5,Fans of Rogue Squadron---this is for you!,"Naboo is run just like Rogue Squadron. Mission and plot based, this gane is full of action. The fact that you can change vehicles in the middle of a mission is a really nice touch. With all of the new game hardware out there (Dreamcast, PS2) N64 comes out with another gem. That's quite something when you compare this with the competition.Star Wars fans will love this game. If there is any drawback - the targets you pursue are sometimes very hard to see. Also, like Rogue, defeating this game without passcodes seems next to impossible."
4,Average Star Wars Game.,"I think Star Wars Episode 1: Battle for Naboo is a great game overall, following the line of the other great Star Wars game, Rogue Squadron. The graphics seem even crispier in this game than even in Rogue Squadron. Also, this game is great for those who like challenges, since the game is very hard in some places, and the powerups are really hard to fine. On the whole, this is a great game and a must for Star Wars fans, and also for those who like the action genere, even though that a number of people still believe that the original triology was the best (including myself)."
2,Not the best,"This game is not that great. It is hard and repetitive. The visuals are great, but the controls are unresponsive at worst and jerky at best. The missions are confusing and unexplained. Music is ok and so are visuals."
3,Aaaargh. Not another.,"Insanely good game. There's one tiiny flaw though: repetitiveness. How are you supposed to enjoy this game when there are two like it, namely Rogue Squadron and Shadows of the Empire? They're all the same because you can't change anything. Either that or the X-Wing games have spoiled me like that. You have shields which you can't reinforce or shunt energy to, lasers are infinite, things like that. It's as monotonous as Clinton's pardons. Buy Rogue Squadron. I recommend it over this."
1,"Great movies, LOUSY transfer","There really isn't much else to say. The films are great, but they have not been digitally remastered. Very disappointing. Buy the Film Noir Classic Collections by Warner instead."
1,Do us a favor,Please do the public a favor. Don't ever list a collection like this without specifying its contents.
5,Wonderful!,This is a great series! I couldn't put it down! The characters are greatly defined and play out the story together wonderfully :)
2,"imaginative story, pulp writing","Shield of Thunder, like Lord of the Silver Bow, both show great imagination in plot, but pure pulp delivery. If you get a kick out of this period in history, by all means read these books, but I doubt if you'll be moved to reread them."
4,4.5 stars,"Yeah, one of the best!! This book held my attention even when ""other things"" fought to take it. Very sad to hear that this author died. We'll miss his talent and his storytelling!"
5,Bittersweet Pleasure,"This is the last Gemmell wrote. It was with baited breath I awaited its release. I wanted to savor it slowly, but it moved so well I finished it in two sittings. As usual, the characters drove the book. I believe he could write about grass growing and make it interesting. If you are a fan, I don't need to convince you this book is worth owning. If you've never read Gemmell, this is obviously not the place to start. You will want to, at least, read the first book of the trilogy.Lord of the Silver Bow (Troy Trilogy, Book 1)You won't be disappointed. I have read everything he has written, and love them all. I only hope that the last installment was far enough along to hold up to his standards"
5,"more solid than the commercial model, stands up to use, keep it hidden or it will disappear","a co worker killed my old, reliable yet persnickety HEAVY GUN METAL stapler from the old days when things were built to last.Somehow she broke it, not knowing the secret rite of restoring it to usefulness, and permanently broke it.I despaired of ever stapling agian, and got the really cheap one at the large store,a nd it failed.Then I got this one.I keep it hidden.It works."
3,"If you staple a lot, go with the Swingline commercial model","The Swingline 747 is alright, alas at times it does not do the job. It will occasionally smush a staple on top of your documents, rather than neatly affixing them together. Best to go with the Swingline 767 (a.k.a. Swingline Premium Commercial Stapler) if you do much stapling at all. The bonus with the 767 is that it has a nice heft and therefore doubles as a weapon if someone in the office really irks you. (Note: don't actually use it as a weapon, unless you want to go in for assault - the weight of the thing could lay somebody out. While that can be satisfying to imagine, try not to let the dream turn into reality.) I unfortunately left my 767 at my old job - too honest to take it. To this day, I regret that move. Now I am stuck with a subpar model, and searching amazon for a good deal on the 767."
5,Our son is OBSESSED,"Our 8-month-old son can't get enough of this book! A friend of ours sent it to him for Christmas and he LOVES it. All we have to do is pick it up and start reading and he comes crawling at the speed of light screaming to be on our lap. I normally don't like books with gimics ( The books is actually a sort of jack in the box with a stuffed animal bear that ""pops out of his den"") but this one is very sweet and cuddly and my son can't get enough!"
2,A waste of time and money,"What a disappointment! This was our first course in Latin and to get the full course you have to buy 3 books, the cassettes, and the videos. A lot of money, but being beginners, we were insecure and did it. We wasted a whole year on just rote memorization of Latin vocabulary lists you could have just as easily gotton off the internet. The only real value were the pronounciation tapes at about $ each. The teacher's manual is not user friendly and the order of the book as pertains to actual use is poor. The only grammar is memorization of chants which are given no explanation. After using this course we switched to Minimus adn learned more in the 12 weeks it took to finish that book than the whole previous year wasted on Latin Primer I. Save your money. Minimus was only $ compared to over $ for this one."
2,Latin instruction without soul!,"Having had experience with the Minimus texts, which my children found very engaging, I was sorely dissapointed in the mechanical nature of the Latin Primer. Memorization of grammar and vocabulary are very important at any level of Latin instruction; however, when teaching children it is paramount that they remain interested in the subject. The Latin Primer was pure drudgery, even I dredded the instruction time. Do your children a favor and use the Minimus program, the texts are engaging and the teachers manual is clear enough that my wife, who has no experience with latin, is able to give instruction."
3,Acceptable,"If I weren't trying to do auto repair, this would have been a fine purchase. If you're looking for a clamp that can handle work in a car though, skip this product."
3,Wig is small and my Santa has a big head,"The actual quality of the wig and beard set is nice, but the wig itself is small and difficult to keep on. My Santa has a big head, but it didn't fit my head well either. Sad that it is not returnable. ""These products are NOT returnable, if they are in a snap closure package or any box/bag that is not factory sealed."" It came in a ziplock bag. Oh well, guess I will use my seamstress talents and see if I can extend the edges of the wig cap to make it fit. Maybe I will make a new Mrs Claus wig out of it and Mr Claus will just get a beard to switch out. Still very pleased with the actual quality..........just make sure your Santa doesn't have a big head."
2,Should have read the reviews!,"I wish I had read the reviews on here before purchasing this book. I was greatly disappointed with it. It gives an excellent view of the author, her show dogs and her daughter but I felt it lacked information about the Maltese which is what I had hoped for in a book entitled, A New Owners Guide to Maltese. It gave very generic information in my opionion and was not that helpful. If you are looking for specific information on how to care for your new Maltese keep searching."
1,I Took This Back!,"This book was an ""impulse buy"" from Borders Books and Music. When I got it home and read it, I was so disappointed that I returned it-something I rarely do. For lighter reading, The Essential Maltese by Howell Book House is much more informative; for the more serious fancier, The Complete Maltese by Nicholas Cutillo is a must-have. Don't waste your time and money on this book!"
5,Awesome Buy !!!,"Kudos Retail Killer.The bag arrived in pristine condition.The quality is just too good for the price.Thick padding all round to protect your loved camera/camcorder.The bag doesnt look too big in the pic, but it actually is.Can easily house an slr and one small lens + all the accessories.came with a tripod stand, lens cleaner and pouch.Extremely satisfied with my purchase."
2,not highly recomended,"I feel that Jay Luvass didnt describe this battle in the best way he could. Being a Social Studies teacher, i feel i know alot about this battle and many of the details. I have also read many other books on this battle. I enjoy studying and reading up on this battle and i think that Jay could have done a much better job on portraying the main idea. If your not looking to learn all that much, then its and ok book but definitley do not read it for historical information."
5,Pefect addition to any air tool.,Quick change couplers are a MUST HAVE for any person that works with air tool. Slip one on every tool you own and be able to swap tools instantly. Lifesaver when working on the car.
1,Very Boring,Gave the book a try and read several pages. Dull setting with a plot unable to hold my interest. Unworhy to be called a mystery.
2,"Velikovski not dead , he strike again","I think ""Time ships"" or ""anti-Ice"" or ""Voyage"" was better. This book is slow and the scenario is not credible. But may be there is more in it than at first look. No comet but something nuclear ?"
1,An Ethnocentric 2001 Wannabe,"If you want to read a negative, ethnocentric, racist, unoriginal book, this is the book for you. According to the author, Stephen Baxter, no one exists on earth except for people in England, Scotland, Russia and parts of the United States. And, only white people exist in this book. Even the character living in Japan is Irish, not Japanese. I believe mention is made of one person of African descent, but only of this person's death.If you want to find out how mean, selfish, and prejudiced white people are on earth, please read this book. All the main characters stereotype and prejudge others. The protagonist hates Russians and makes negative comments about them and Russia.Gee, I wonder if these are Mr. Baxter's true feelings...The plot is a standard Arthur C. Clarke wannabe.I'm sorry I ever purchased this book."
2,Well below his usual standard,"I have read, and loved, Stephen Baxter's Titan and Voyage. Moonseed was for me well below the standard set by his other books, and far from a gripping read. While I am sure the science was accurate (I am not a geologist) I found the plot highly implausable, the characters boring, the story very slow moving, and actually struggled to reach the end, being tempted many times to give it up. All in all, too much science and too little story and people. A disappointment."
2,"Knows his Geology, but not his Biology or Planetology","Enjoying SF is all about suspension of disbelief. The author lost me the first time when the retired cop breaks some ribs (including a compound fracture)and keeps on truckin for HOURS. Unless the guy either can shut of pain or is Superman, this aint gonna happen.Terraforming the Moon ? Maybe. But...there is no satisfactory answer as to WHY the Moonseed chooses this particular time to start doing its stuff when its been in the solar system for billions of years. I also found out from a planetologist friend of mine that the Earth has been bombarded by stuff from the moon for the same billions of years...Just as we have a meteorite from Mars which has been found in antarctica.There also seems to be a time discrepancy as to how long the Earth will last once the Moonseed gets going. Henry thinks its on the short side. It turns out being decades. The story just keeps on getting more and more un-believable as it goes along. Too bad...."
3,treading familiar ground,"Baxter writes a good yarn even if he's a bit too straight-laced and traditional here to suit my tastes.We've seen all this before, under various titles and guises, from the cosy catastrophes of the 50's to the current boom which has been going on for a while.If you've read one, you've almost read them all: there's a large cast of characters and they're nicely handled here, with some surprises and interesting situations and whatnot. There are also some nice ideas - far-fetched for reality, but personally I wouldn't have minded had he made a much larger leap to the unknown. That would have given it some edge over the competition.But in the end, none of that really matters as the big problem in my case (this may not be true of you) is that it treads too familiar ground. It's all stuff that's been written about in hundreds of books during the past 50 odd years, and that's more than one too many. Unless you write the perfect one, that is. And this isn't it."
1,Tedious,"I hate it when I have to skip pages to enjoy a book. Page after page after page after page after page after page of needless details that don't further the plot.Baxter got so bogged down in details about spaceflight and PREPARATION for spaceflight that he forgot he was telling a story. Hey, we're smarter than that. We get it."
4,Interesting twist on the end of the world,"I picked this book up when the local Crown Books was going bankrupt and closing their doors. It took me a little while to get into the book, but once the seed started to grow in Scotland, I was hooked. The ending seemed a little abrupt and I'm not sure I can believe that with what happens to the Earth, the Moon would be unaffected.Overall, though, a fun read."
1,what boredom,"What boredom, how implausible (even for SF), how superficial, tedious, exasperating, waste of time and money - beware! Baxter has never been very gifted as far as literary style is concerened, but this is just too much"
3,Summer Reading/Mind Candy,"Don't read this for the character development or science fact, it's just a fun story. I consider it, ""Lucifer's Hammer Lite."" I did creep out reading about the latest volcano eruption, I'll give 'em that!"
2,2 times 2 long,"""Moonseed"" starts out well, but very soon gets bogged down in long, detailed geological descriptions that read like classroom lectures. This would have been a great book if it was half the length."
3,"Very good, but not the best from Baxter","Baxter is one of the best living SF writers and all his books deserve a read (at least I have not yet found one that does not).Moonseed is very good but is not his best. Maybe I'm being overly critic because the story is ""too close to home"", and does not go as deep as many others in exploring other life forms and time scales in the Universe. Or maybe it's the characters and some unrealistic plot twists.On the positive, the book explores the possibility of the Earth being attacked by a nano-device that practically melts the soil, breaking the upper crust and stimulating heavy volcanic activity. It has some interesting ""scenes"" on the Moon, and is overall a pleasant read. However, for those used to Baxter, beware that this is not his best. Good read!"
2,Caveat Emptor: a minutely detailed catalog of despair,"Forget the high-minded ""great science"" reviews. The story goes, quite literally, nowhere. This is not the return of ""hard science"" science fiction... it's the birth of hard science nihilism. All human effort not only comes to naught, but is ""ironically"" self-defeating. The noblest human efforts contain the ""seeds"" (wink-wink) of destruction. And not just destruction, but the implosion of both earth, humankind, and hope itself. There are no real characters here, only wind-up self-destruct dolls programming to either destroy, screw-up, or surrender in the paralysis of ennui. Why is it that the science journals and others rave about this so much? I doubt that very many who purchase the book on the basis of the rave cover blurbs actually make it more than halfway through."
2,From a therapist's view -- A bit too simplistic for some clients--,"I was disappointed with this book because I don't think it offers many ""tools"" for clients to use in an everyday setting. The book seems to be a compilation of bits and pieces from other grief, mourning, and bereavement books. It's an easy read, however, and some clients prefer the book over others on grief and mourning because it is easy to read and digest.Cherie Renfrow StarryPrivate Practice Therapist/Counselor"
1,remote entry,"After Several Hrs. Trying On Different Days, Could Not Make Remote Work. Was Told 05 matrix and 05 corolla Used the Same System and should work. O' Well May Try Again When Weather Warms Up. Don't Have Much Hope Though."
5,Very well engineered product,"1 gripe - the ring openings on the crimp terminal wouldn't fit the lugs of a standard solenoid and had to be swapped out (not a biggie in my book)Otherwise - an extremely well done piece. Factory look fit and function in every way. Very easy installation instructions, very serviceable after the fact (fuse and relay swaps are a breeze with a little planning)You might build one yourself for a smidge less - but I doubt it would be this solid."
4,Painless Harness,"This is the easiest and best harness for adding high output headlamps to a classic car. The harness is fused and has individual relays for each circuit. Works Great! A bit overpriced in my opinion, but it is a great harness and easy to install. I recommend this product, and it was $45.00 cheaper on Amazon than at Summit or Jegs!"
2,You have really got to be kidding!,This novel is too long by 300 pages. Danael Blanks is plainly insane. This much is plainly obvious. What we as readers don't need is the bulk of the psychoprattle he uses to either discribe or justify himself. If one can manage to get past that and keep it in its place they might well enjoy reading this book.
4,The First But Not Quite The Best.,"This was the first of many Lawrence Sanders books I read, Edward X Delaney is one of my favourite detective characters and was only surpassed when Archie McNally appeared on the scene. Whenever I make a sandwich I just wish I had Mr Delaney with me to offer one of his concoctions.It is a major loss to crime fiction that Mr Sanders is no longer with us and as others have stated Why oh Why did he not do the 5th, 6th and 7th in the Deadly Sin series. Perhaps there is a writer out there who can do it, but that might ruin the memory of these 4 great books.Oh, about this book, it was almost a fantastic read but as already said by earlier reviews he slipped up on the ending. But you have to forgive him after creating such a wonderful main character for the rest of the series."
3,Too bad Sanders isn't that well remembered.,"Sanders isn't mentioned in any of the mystery encyclopedias I have seen. You practically have to look him up on web sites genuinely devoted to mystery lovers. If he is remembered at all it will probably be for Delaney and McNally. It takes the first 150 or 200 pages to really get into this novel, especially when it comes to where one can feel comfortable liking it. And the ending isn't particularly great. But the Epilogue is interesting. The read leaves one wondering it this book isn't more psycological thriller than mystery.If you want a light read or a good suspense, go elsewhere."
5,A Classic,"I read this book about a decade ago, and it still sticks out in my head. I'm an avid mystery reader (4-5 a month), and there are only a handful of books that really stand out to me, this being one. I'm surprised there were not more reviews of this book. Ten years after reading it, I don't remember the details, other than it was extremely well-written, gritty, and disturbing - all of my favorite components of a good book. For me, this one is up there with some of the best."
1,Terrile book,"One of the worst books I have tried to read. I just gave up. Not interesting at all. Shipping was great, very quick. My fault for ordering such a bad book"
4,A good read.,The book was a little dark but readable. Plenty of action and it kept your interest. Overall a good book.
5,Fantastic Reading!!,This is an excellent book! I was upset that it came to an end! Lawrence Sanders gives such a detailed look inside both the hero and the villian. I wish he didn't stop at the Fourth Deadly Sin!
1,New Age Blather from an Old School Lout,"...has anyone in recent memory made MORE of a living out of hoisting his dirty shorts in the air and calling it a flag? Sorry, folks, the joke's on us. No literary merit here, and no emotion - but plenty of emotive, jargony foam.Stay away. I wish I had. Can I give it less than one star?"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book looking for information about ninjitsu and the employment of ninjas but was disappointed. The book describes the demigod-like abilities of ninjas, listing a series of feats that seem to be nothing but tall tales. This book might be suitable for a young ninja fan, but not for an adult that is looking for accurate information or historical records."
5,the ninja,"This is a great book to read for anyone beginning their exploration of ninjitsu. Its a good historical guide and is easy to read with lots of pictures, and alot of good fictional scenerios. Once you have a basic understanding though you will want to read more books by Hatsumi and other of Stephen Hayes works to get a more in depth picture of the ancient art. Great for anyone interested in learning more about the life of the ninja or beggining the art training."
3,An informative book on the basis of ninjutsu.,"This book is a general information book on the art of ninjutsu, and its followers. It touches on many aspects of it, yet not too deeply. It is a good book for someone who is seeking knowledge on the subject, about what he/she does not know a whole lot about. Unfortunately many who are familiar with the art will look at it and say, ""oh, no, not another one"". On the lighter side, I found no misrepresantions or bending of facts in the book. All that the author says is true, and he is knowledgable. I have also found that in my copy of the book about 30 pages toward the end have been reprinted, even with the same page number. So as it is, the pages go 1, 2,...87, 88, 65, 67.. So you get the same information twice. I do not know if it is only a misprint of my copy, or it is in all versions."
1,"Murder, He Says",I loved the movie when I saw it and I would have loved it this time if the DVD's were not blank.
3,Just OK,"I bought this movie as I like Fred MacMurray. This was not one of his best movies,I was disappointed in it, will not watch a second time.Sharon."
3,Everybody Chasing Everbody,"Fred MacMurray stars as a pollster looking for a disappeared colleague in hillbilly country who gets mixed up with Marjorie Main and her half-witted brood trying to recover some hidden money. The film is non-stop action, as everyone is chasing or running away from everyone else. There's glowing animals (and the odd person or two) and it's set in one of those only-in-a-movie houses with secret passageways behind the walls. The characters aren't played with much subtlety, and the laughs are sometimes forced, but it's all played with a lot of energy. A better director might have given the film a little style instead of just hammering home every scene, but if you like a lot of slapstick and chase films, you'll probably enjoy this one a lot,"
4,Good Movie,This was a very well done movie with Fred MacMurray. It was funny and suspenseful. Good Family Movie!I would recommend this movie for a good evening.
1,"Waited a long time for this on, but...","Funny movie and I waited a long time for it to make it to DVD, but the copy I received did not play on either of my machines."
2,"gobble, gobble","It's hard to believe the reviews of this turkey. I bought the video on the basis of them. The film itself turned out to be a great disappointment. It's a Paramount ""B"", utterly lacking in humor or wit. The acting is on a TV sitcom level. Fred McMurray does his best with a lousy script; his pantomine scene is surely the low point of his long career. In short, this is a cheapo without more than a single laugh. Anyone comparing this with The Pink Panther series or any major film comedy has a screw loose."
4,"Fnnny, She Says","First saw this film about 40 years ago, and laughed heartily at the over-the-top antics and silliness that still holds up to this day. Who knew that Fred MacMurray had such a comedic side to him, reminiscent of Cary Grant in ""Arsenic and Old Lace""? His straight man to Marjorie Main's buffoonery-filled family brought back a lot of memories, and the classic scene of him in the cellar posing as the ""short"" twin, is hilarious.My whole family has enjoyed this underappreciated movie once again. If you like old-fashioned fun with mystery, murder, romance and even treasure, you want to see this!"
3,EN COM BEESUS HONOR FLEESUS,"ARE YOU READY FOR ZANY HILLBILLIES , MYSTERY , WITH GLOWING ANIMALS AND PEOPLE IN A COMEDY . THAT'S A SHORT SUMMARY OF THIS MOVIE."
1,zip wax,I've used zip wax for years and loved it. However the last two that i ordered did not remove hair like the previous zip wax did.I've decided not to used it anymore. I threw out the remainder of the wax.
1,New formula is really bad,I have use Zip for years. I ordered it again and it is lighter in color and it has a grainy texture. It does not remove hair like the old wax. I bought it from Drugstore.com. Used them before with no issues. Both shipments - two different sizes have this new formula that is terrible!!
1,New Zip Wax formula is awful,"Zip Wax in the block form has changed its formula and now it is just awful. I have used Zip Wax for over 30 years. How do we complain or suggest to the manufacturer? I see it is distributed by Lee Pharmaceuticals in S. El Monte, California. No phone number but might be a start. So disappointed! Does anyone have a contact number for Zip Wax source? Plus I want my wooden spatula back and not this new plastic one!"
1,not satisfied,I have not received this item yet. The money has been deducted from my account. Where is it ????
1,DISAPPOINTING:(,"I bought this based on the positive reviews. I really wanted it to work, but it did a very poor job. I followed the instructions carefully and took my time. The wax only removed a couple of hairs and then crumbled off. I tried two more times and still had the same results. It hurt a lot and gave me a bunch of little red bumps."
1,Zip wax new formula is just horrible.,"I've been using zip wax for many years. It was the best product, but they had to go and change the formula. It is just awful. I have one more sentence to add....CHANGE IT BACK!!!!!"
5,Can't Live without it!,"I have been using zip hot wax remover for years. Initially, one could find it in drugstores. I have coarse black hair and am of Mediterranean descent. So my moustache is quite dark. I have tried electrolysis (takes too long to really kill a hair root and must be repeated several times at long intervals before the root is dead). I have also bleached (a waste of money as you still have a moustache only a blond one!). Other waxes with strips never worked for me. Now that I am older and post menopausal, some of the hairs are white (electolysis may not kill white hairs). I use it every two-three weeks. Put powder on the area to be waxed. Put the wax in a container in the microwave for 2 1/2 minutes and spread it on. In a few minutes, pull it off. You get used to the initial sting. Results: smooth, clean and hairless!"
1,New Zip Wax?,"Zip wax used to be the only wax that could remove my hair clearly and completely. However, this seems to be new wax. This wax was grainy and a lighter yellow in color. Additionally, it did not remove the hair nearly as well as the old wax."
2,bad batch,I have been ordering this product online ever since they stopped carrying it in the stores. This is the first batch that I've bought that was bad. The wax does not melt properly and is milky in color. I'm assuming that the cause is that it is very old.
3,Not overly impressed.,"Maybe I should have bought a smaller package. The 7 oz block is too big for my at home wax warmer, and it's impossible to just 'break off a chunk' like other reviewers say. Removes most of the hair, but whatever brand of wax came with my unit worked better, but I didn't save the packaging to know what that was. Overall I'd say it's average."
4,Zip Hot Wax Hair Remover,I have used this product over the years but it is no longer stocked at Walmart or at Walgreen's. I found it on Amazon.comThe product is excellent and can be used over and over. It is gentle on the skin and does not require messy strips. The hair is pulled out by the root and it leaves your skin very smooth. I also do not require medicated lotions after use.No messy residue is left on skin.
2,Service less than adequate.,"After several letters, I finally received my order about 10 days after the promised delivery date. I will not order this product from this supplier again. This is the first time that this has happened with anything I have ordered from Amazon."
2,Not made the way it used to be,"I am highly disappointed with the product I received. Once, nothing compared to Zip Wax for the way it removed my very difficult to wax hair. Now it is not only harder to manage, but the product no longer grips hair the way it used to. I might as well use duct tape!"
1,Not worth it,"I ordered two other Dvds with this one and Brainy Baby-Spanish was the best. It kept my 23 month old engaged, while 123 Cuentame un Cuento is a bit advanced and Galloping Minds -- I did not care for at all -- anyone can hold up flash cards! In any event, Brainy Baby-Spanish was worth the buy. I am a spanish speaking mother who wanted to find a good product for my daughter while I am at work so she may study the language while she is at home since my sitter only speaks limited spanish. Thank you Brainy Baby!"
3,Pancho Barnes book,"This book bought used took 3 weeks to receive. It did not give a picture of the cover which is different from the former version I had seen. I think maybe a older printing, but it is in good shape and I am happy to have found it."
2,Not effective for my dandruff and scalp relief.,"I was disappointed, because of the high reviews but I tried it for a month and found no effect on my scalp. Good shampoo, though."
5,The best one of the books,Girls in Pants:the third summer of the sisterhood is my favortie of the four books. my favortie story line is Bee's becasue she goes back to camp and see's Eric again!
4,Another Summer with the Pants,"This third installment is a welcome addition to the series. I couldn't help but feel that it was more predictable than the previous books.Overall, I enjoyed the book and sensed that each of the characters were maturing and seemingly more introspective in their lives. I look forward to reading the next books."
4,Brilliant,"Girls in Pants was, in my view, a fantastic book. The third installment of the series was the most powerful for me. It hooked me like a fish and for hours I poured over the pages of this meaningful, heart warming novel of Ann Brashares. What I liked about this book was that the girls were growing up and figuring out more about who they are. I spent hours after reading the book just thinking about everything written over in my head. This book isn't for everybody but if you enjoy a book that is based on reality with a twist of magic, then this book is what you should be picking up. I suggest though, that you read the first two books before you read this one to fully appreciate the writing and story of Girls in Pants. This book is, in the simplest terms, great."
5,a must read,"I am a huge fan of the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants series. I thought that the first 2 books were amazing and really allowed me to understand each character in Brashare's wonderful sub-plots. The third was not disapointing. I didnt know what to expect, but was happy to find that these characters grew and were changing, while essentially staying the same. However, i was slightly disapointed that more of the 1st and 2nd were not mentioned. Brashares really didnt elaborate of the loose endings she created at the end of the 2nd. Still, Girls in Pants is an amazing book, and i highly recommend it"
4,Not too shabby,"If you've read the other two books in this series you may not think that this one is quite up to par, and I would agree with you on that. Although I did read this book in less than 24 hours (It's pretty short.), I definitely got more into the first two books. Anyway... in this book Carmen meets Win (yes I know, strange name) at the hospital, Lena must disobey her dad in order to keep doing what she loves (art), Tibby is uncertain about a more intimate relationship with Brian, and Bee comes face o face with someone from her past. Personally, I liked Bee's plot line the best. It was the most exciting. Although this wasn't Brashares' best work give it a try. You might like it better than I did:)"
5,Excellent book,Girls in Pants is a magnificent book that tells a great deal about a teen girl's life. Brashares obviously remebers what it is like to be a teen becuase she is able to write about it with such relation. I recomend this book to teen girls becuse it is heart-warming and completely thrilling!
3,Pants need to be handed down,I couldn't wait until the third book came out. It was good but disapointing at the same. I enjoy the characters but they are really insecure and not too believable this time. Maybe that happens when you get older. But you don't always get the guy in real life.I still enjoyed this book.
2,"luck never gives, it only lends","This book is okay, i found it to be boring and hard to finish. It starts out great, and i like it, but...it just wasn't as good as other books I'v read."
1,CHECK OUT BALLET FRIENDS INSTEAD!!!!,"I have this book, and it's just alright. I thought Carmen was extremely whiny and annoying and stuck-up about what college she should go to. I hated the parts with Tibby and her boyfriend. It was very lame. But the fourth book stunk the most. It was a disappointing last book, and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I think the series is overrated anyway, and it's been totally exploited with the dumb scrapbooks, box sets, and the average movie. Recently a friend told me about a brand new series called Ballet Friends Books and it sounds incredible!!! The site is balletfriendsbooks and it's got tons of info on the new books, plus free music, and cool stuff. It sounds like a really funny hip series, which is like a breath of fresh air!!! So if you like good books, take my advice and check it out!!!"
5,AWESOME!!,I read the 3rd one in less than two days!! I couldn't put it down!! I just hope there are more to come!!
3,more and more boring.,"The first book was great!The second book was good.This book is only OK.Even though they keep popping these out. With each new book, the plot gets less and less powerful, and the bounds of their relationships seem more unrealistic. Its still a great book, but it is like watching kidsWB remake Looney Tunes into a crime fighting team. Its just not the same."
5,great book,"this just may be my favorite pants book. but to really understand this book u had to know who the characters were. i just really loved it because it showed what a real friendship is all about. the end made me cry because the characters seem so real and they are splitting up to go tho college. if u liked the other pants books, u will love this one."
3,"Well, this was OK, but not AS good....","The Third Summer of the Sisterhood started out a little slowly, in fact, I had to read it twice before it became interesting. It was a little too descriptive, not much seemed to be happening, and I thought it was a pretty bad third summer.The second time I read it, I appreciated it a bit more, and I liked it. It took until the middle of the book to get interesting, but it really grabbed you once you got there.The writing style was descriptive and capturing, though it took awhile to really FLOW. The plot wasn't too complicated, but it could get confusing if you forget which girl is which. I would definitely recommend reading the other books first, though you don't HAVE to.Basically, this book was pretty good, but a bit weepy, and I would recommend this book for girls ages 10-16. It's their last summer together, though some parts don't quite satisfy."
3,Serviceable third installment,"What can I say? I liked the novels enough to keep reading them and just finished the third one - but I never ""loved"" them.Lots of good girl power stuff in this one per usual. The girls continue to grow and learn about themselves. Carmen in particular went from being a whiny baby in the first one to a young woman who started to really know herself.I appreciated the fact that while a couple of them experienced first love (Lena and Bridget, and maybe Tibby) none of them were boy-crazy. Despite their human flaws, they seemed quite grounded.I have to wonder if Brashares left the Lena/Kostos storyline ambivalent for a possible fourth installment. I would be interested to see how she plays that out."
4,Friends forever!,"Tibby, Carmen, Lena, and Bridget, the closer-than-sister friends from two previous books, are back for the last summer before they go to college. Boyfriends and college are the two largest issues in this book, with Tibby and Carmen beginning new romances, and Lena and Bridget mourning over old ones. There are also family problems--Tibby's sister has an accident, and Carmen's mom becomes pregnant, but the girls seem better able to face problems with growing maturity. As always they pass around the pants and support one another when they have problems, but it is evident that they are ready to launch into a new world with new friends and growing insight. This is the third of a wonderful coming-of-age series."
5,Never a dissapointment,"This book was fantastic as were the other 2 previous books. Whats great is that each book gets better...it is never a dissapointment which often happens when reading book series. I must admit that this reading is intended for the young reader, but Iam 23 years old and I am truly a die-hard fan of this series....I can't wait for the fourth book to be published and I am hopeful that Ann Brashares will write a novel that brings us up to date with how the girls are doing several years after their college experiences. I do hope that Kostos enters back into the book because the romance between he and Lena is by far my favorite! I would reccomend this to any reader at any age, its not just for highschool and junior high girls....it brings you back to the days when lifes problems were simple and yet seemed so monumental. Bottom Line buy the book!"
4,Nice Book,"This book is really awesome. It deals with stuff every girl goes through:1.) a friend becoming more (Tibby)2.) doing something your parents don't like (Lena)3.) feeling left out when a new sibling comes (Carmen)4.) rekindling old flames (Bridget)Seriously, this book rocks. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the writing style. I think Ann Brashares' writing style is somewhat flawed. I love the ideas and everything incorporated within the stories, but I couldn't get over the weird structure a good bit of the sentences had. I sat there for 20 minutes with one sentence going ""what??"". And some sentences have grammar problems. (No clue if it was her mistake or her editor's.)Other than that, great read."
3,Not the greatest,"I was a bit disappointed by the third installment of the ""Sisterhood"" series. Usually I can't put the books down because they grab my attention immediately, but that was not the case for this one. Of the four girls, I only found Bridget's story to be truly compelling, even if I did know how it was going to end. Tibby and Carmen's stories were all right, even though Carmen apparently hasn't learned from her past mistakes because she acted the exact same way as she did in books one and two. As a character, she doesn't grow until the very end of this book. As for Lena - who is usually my favourite ""Sister"" - I found her story to be a complete bore. The descriptions of her portraits did nothing for me.Though not as good as the first two books, hopefully ""Girls in Pants"" will make the series complete once the last book is out. It's a must for any fan of the books, but if you're new to the Sisterhood, this book isn't the place to start. Looking forward to ""Forever in Blue!"""
5,One of the best ones of the sisterhood!!!!,"The third book of the sisterhood was so good. It talked about the girls going in their own seperate directions after highschool and how they can make it in this world. It talks about how they each need the support of their families and how they can't make it in this world without each other. There a bit more independant in this book. Each girl faces her own set of challenges, even though life gets busy and certain things threaten to tear them apart, they each come back to each other, and realize more about themselves."
2,Filler Novel,I did not like this book nearly as much as the previous two. Everything felt a little flat to me and it was seriously unrealistic. I did not feel like the characters really grew at all in this book and it feels like a filler. I'm hoping that means the fourth book is better.
5,Girls in Pants,i absolutely loved the series. i cant wait to start reading the 4th book. ann brashares is an amazing author. anbody who loves to read about young love and friendship would love this book.
4,I'm still hooked!,"Although this third installment of the Traveling Pants series did not resonate with me the way The Second Summer of the Sisterhood did, I continue to be impressed with, and addicted to, this series. It's nice to see that although the characters learned some lessons in the last book, Ms. Brashares did not try to portray them as mature adults. The Traveling Pants girls are still teenagers and still act as such, which is honest and refreshing. I find myself feeling sad that there will only be one more Traveling Pants book to enjoy, and to me, that is a hallmark of a wonderful series!"
5,Awesome!,In my oppinion this is the best out of all three books. Even though the girls are going to college next there needs to be another book.
3,not like the first and the second,After the first and second part seems the author without ideas... long sequences without any happening
5,love it!!,"okay, im definately 15 and i absolutely love this book! the first 2 were SO good i pre ordered this one and its new favorite book. and im not like some teeny bopper or anything too, it was just SUCH a good book. i really think every girl should read it! it was entertaining, funny, sweet, and ahh just everything. i love it! READ IT!!!!!!"
5,A great addition to the series,"I really enjoyed this third book in the Sisterhood of the Traveling pants. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.I'm definitely keeping my fingers crossed that we'll see a fourth book soon?"
4,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"Once upon a time there was one pair of thrift shop jeans that became the Traveling Pants. How can one pair of jeans look so good on the figures of four different girls? Carmen, Tibby, Lena, and Bridget form the Sisterhood and contemplate this question on the eve of spending their summer apart, scattered all over the globe. An all-together enchanting novel by first-time writer Brashares."
5,ThirdSummer_Sisterhood/Traveling Pants Review,"It was a great continuation from the first two books. I think it is more teenager to adult vs. young child or junior adult in its content, but it is a great story. A lot of fun to read and I loved reading all the happenings of each of the girls' and their families. Having seen the movie - I picture the actors as I am reading...."
1,One word to describe this book: Horrible,I'm really mad at our school for having this as our textbook.This book talks too much about the history of physics than to focus on concepts and how to solve problems. It doesn't tell you what kind of equations you should use for what type of problems. Some answers on the back of the book are wrong.This book is bad for both self studying and for class supplement.This book is just not for studying physics nor for anything else. I'd say it's garbage.
3,CD ROM,"We got the text book, but we never received the cd rom. I emailed several times,a bout the missing cd rom, but received no teply."
4,This camera is perfect!,"The set is wonderful, but the case is so big and it is not confortable to be carried."
5,quality product,These tables are the best thing because they are well made and do not take up much space and they fit nicely beside the couch. When we need more tables we just take these out and place them wherever needed. The tables are light weight and are attractive and fit in with our oak decor.
4,"""Clones are more free thinking than droids...""","I love clone troopers. When the preview figures came out, I bought five to start off my clone army. On the 23rd, I was at [the store] making sure to fill my shopping bag and BAM there's the 12"" Clone Trooper waiting for me.While previous 12"" figures from the Star Wars line suffered mostly from lack of articulation (Barbie-like articulation), the new figures use a G.I. Joe body (kung-fu grip) and provide a much greater range of posability.Despite what the pictures show, the trooper CAN actually actually hold the rifle with both hands (not just rest it on top of one) and you can get some pretty good action poses.Looking forward to the different color rank variants!"
5,verry good,i like it i love to collect star wars items i have a hole wall shelf full and this has just added the true fun you dont hAVE TO BE A KID TO INJOY AN GOOD TOY SUCH AS THIS I JUS T WOOD LOVE TO SAY THANK YOU
3,"quality is fine, did not fit me well","these are thick and durable. I bought for a trip. I was 6 -7 months along, huge all over and 5'3. These are very hard to get on (but this is typical per a friend who has to wear medical compression hose b/c of vein issues)walking through an airport was not fun b/c they kept sagging and by the time I got to the bathroom to pull up, they were halfway down my crotch/thighs. Not a good look....or feeling. I bought a large, too since I was weighing about ~160 or so at the time."
3,Don't fit quite right,"I bought size medium, and that is the size I have worn in another brand which fit well, but these did not fit well. They were too short, always sliding off my pregnant belly. I spent the whole day pulling them up! They were also very tight, very hard to get on, which is good to a point, but these were just ridiculous. I do like that they are more sheer than other brands I have worn. They are like regular panty hose. The color is great. They are not as ugly as my other pair in another brand."
4,Does The Job,This is a inexspensive 4 channel non-bridgable amp. I mostly listen to country music and classic rock and it works fine for me but will be adding a small powered subwoofer later on to increase the bass a little bit. For the price and what I listen to it works fine although I need to add a grounding filter.
4,Good amp,Good amp for the money. 4 channels allow me to pump music to all of my speakers without needing a head unit. It won't rattle any windows but it is adequate for someone seeking clarity instead of decibel level.
3,Half Good,I bought this for my new riding lawn mower including a stereo. All the wiring was included. Two of the 4 channels don't work. After a huge headache of trial and error I just hooked two R and two L to the rear working channel. The cost was OK if I had bought at a store I would have returned it. It would have been cheaper to buy A two channel amp and do this.
1,I didn't even know it was possible to sound this bad,"Just an awful product, there is just a gain knob not even a crossover, the terminals are cheep and can melt very easily. This amp maybe! just maybe puts out 25 watts rms and thats with very high distortion! i hooked it up to a pair for rockford fosgate power p1652 and it made those speakers sound like crap....spend the extra money and get some decent."
1,bad sound quality,This item is garbage. I hooked it up in my car and got static where there should be silence. I mean a lot of static not and ignore-able amount. I returned it to Amazon (Great return service btw) and got a nicer one hooked up with all the same wires in the same place and got the performance I was looking for. Don't waste time and money on this trash.
1,only for advanced fingerstyle players,I bought this dvd and I am very disappointed. I have been playing for a couple of years and this is for very advanced players. The instruction is very limited and there is no menu. If you are beginner or intermediate this is not for you
5,This is one of the best Delphi 3 books available.,"Ray Konopka's _Developing Custom Delphi 3 Components_ stands as one of the best books ever written for Delphi. It is an exhaustive and rigorous description on component creation in Delphi 3 and might be daunting for the novice, but if you are serious about this subject and you want to learn more, then you should buy this book."
3,Hmm,"Interesting release from Robbins Entertainment. This is a housy number with decent vocals, although mostly forgettable. The only thing that sparks any memory is how similar it sounds to Hani's remix of Alicia Keys' ""Diary"". Interestingly enough, Hani does remixes on this as well."
1,Uninformative,"I found this book to be thoroughly uninformitive. The author's ""understanding"" of his subject matter was non-existant and he made many statements that were blatantly wrong and altogether idiotic. If I could I would give this book negative five stars."
1,Bogus,"Linking killings with heavy metal is not cool. Of course few people do take music to far. For a band to take you over the edge like that you have to be messed up in the head. Ive been listenin to metal (balck, death, grind, you name it...) and the last thing on my mind is to murder someone."
1,Why can't we do zero stars?,"An outdated, alarmist collection of urban legends and conspiracy theories is not a 'true story'"
1,A Book of False Information.,"I found that this book had information which is false to the religion of Satanism. Though not a Satanist myself, Ive studied the religion... What this book describes are more or less teenagers out to cause a bit of havoc, and just have fun in their own way. This book is very uninformative and biased, I cant recommend it."
1,Misinformation and Finger Pointing,"This book is a quickly thrown together, very poorly researched attack on a subculture that is not understood. The ""Satanic"" threat is just a bunch of idiotic, inbred, trashy teens from small towns that think that its cool to kill a dog to get power. There is a growing movement of people, me included, that with intelligence and carefull political manuevering, are trying to make the United States a better place for non-Christians. I am Buddhist, and when people find that out, they react in horror or don't understand it. But we have freedom of religion in this country. And this stupid, ignorant book, written probably for quick profit by a greaseball that knows a lot of ""god-fearing"" people will react to their xenophobia, is just not worth your reading time, unless you want to laugh, and believe me, I got quite a few belly laughs from this one!"
3,Great when it works right!,"This is a good little toy when it works right! Wireless signal on it doesn't always pick up, works mucho better on hardwood floors!"
1,Puny Little Car,"I have friends that have these ""Kid Galaxy"" vehicles for their kids and they are big like 10""x10""x12"" My son loves their cars and we want to get him one for Christmas. This is the second Kid Galaxy car we have ordered only to find out that it is, at best, half the size of the measurements listed on the description. The biggest measurement listed for this one is 11 inches so I figured this would be 11 inches long. It is only 6 inches long and 6 inches tall. The box it came in isn't even 11 inches long and to top it off the toy didn't even come in original packaging. It came in a plastic bag inside a brown cardboard box with no packaging or protective wrapping. This is now the second Kid Galaxy car that I will be returning because of the misinformation on the site and the fact that this toy isn't suitable for an older toddler because it is entirely too small."
1,Pretty disappointed,"I was excited to get this for my son, however even with new batteries in it, it wasn't what I expected. #1 You need a skinny long phillips screw driver to get to the screw on the bottom of the toy to put the batteries in. #2 Then I had to wave the remote control around while pressing the button to get some reception so that the truck would go. Finally, I figured out that you have to stand directly over the item while pressing the button to make it go, but if you get less than 6 inches away, the vehicle stops. I'm glad I tried it out before my son saw it because I had to put it away to return the item. Highlights was wonderful about the refund on the product & Amazon refunded my shipping as well. Great customer service, but huge disappointment on the item. Save your money, time, and your excitement on another toy that's worth it!"
4,Enjoyed knowing the secret to what Great Leaders do,"Mr. Blanchard's story-telling style is a very enjoyable read. The SERVE acronym (See the future, Engage and develop others, Reinvent continuously, Value results and relationships, Embody the values) is one every leader would benefit from."
2,Regurgitated Archaic Concepts,"Learned nothing new! The characters are comical, unreal, and unbelievable. Save your money and read your bible instead."
1,Ugh!,"OK, enough with this guy. I buy into the storytelling power of these business fables, but does he even read what he puts his name on? This is one of the most insulting of the bunch, and it gives a bad name to the Lencioni books that really do have a message for many people. While these may seem simplistic, they are not at all easy to do and this one proves what happens when they are rushed into print."
2,This book has nothing to do with The Secret movie.,"The book is about leading a company, not about the law of attraction. Although it may be a fine book for entrepreneurs, it is not a book on philosophy."
4,Enjoyable Story Filled With Solid Leadership Lessons,"In ""The Secret"" Ken Blanchard and Mark Miller provide readers with a simplistic and enjoyable story that explains valuable lessons in leadership. This is not a gripping novel nor is it an in-depth explanation of leadership theory and practices. It is a palatable, memorable, and practical explanation of a serving model of leadership.SERVE is an acronym for Seeing the future, Engaging and developing others, Reinventing continuously, Valuing results and relationships, and Embodying the values. Through the life of the books characters you'll see these principles lived out. Blanchard's found an ingenious formula for sharing keys to effective leadership, management and life. It is a great method of getting the non-technical person to read a business book. ""The Secret"" is another quality offering by Ken Blanchard."
5,Good Quality,This cover was easy to install. It has provided good protection for my leather seats. I would highly recommend this cover for anyone who has a pet and doesn't want their seats to be damaged.
3,I returned this product,"If you purchased this robe in black, the face material is ""slippery"" for a small dog. However, the backing is anti-slip / foam which is what I needed. So I replaced this black one with their green plaid one. This material is perfect!"
5,Great Price!,"It's very easy to clean, absorbs liquids and the price is affordable! My English Bulldog loves it too:) Will buy again soon."
3,Description of rubber backing but......,"I bought this seat cover specifically for the fact it says there is a rubber backing on it to assist with leather seat slipping. Well, there is a FOAM backing which means the cover does tend to slide around on leather seats. The cover does fit as described, to include the seat belt holes, and provides a little cushioning and warmth for the dogs on cool morning car rides. It also is pretty good at keeping the dog accidents from getting on your seat if your pet doesn't enjoy those car rides as much as you do."
2,Boring,The background music puts one to sleep.Very little of the beauty of Ireland is shown as advertised. Somewhat amateurish. Could have used some vocal commentary.
1,A Celtic Journey -- Wales,My sister sent me the 4-video Celtic Journeys after my shoulder surgery made it difficult to sleep in a bed and I had to sleep in a leather recliner. Just the soporific required under the circumstances.
4,Bumper Cars for Dolls,"These bumper cars are great for 10 inch and smaller dolls, they look cute in them, have a great time and don't leave black wheel marks on the floors! If you are a doll collector/player you will certainly enjoy these for Betsy McCall, Tiny Ann, Kish kids and many of the new bjd's that are available."
4,Men of the Saddle 2,"I liked this one. There were several parts that made me laugh, and it was an enjoyable plot.Beau Claxton is the answer to one woman's prayers, but he'd like to argue the fact and go home. The Lord has other plans, however, and gently works in mysterious ways to change hearts."
1,philosophy primer,"I didn't make it even halfway through - couldn't take it anymore. The story revolves around a handful of women looking back to the time they attended college together and the men they slept with. Endless dialogue at the level philosophy 101. I skipped pages and pages as they discussed basic philosophy under the pretense of homework, books they read and quotes they stick in the corners of their mirrors. Oy vay."
2,Not what i expected,Disturbances in the Field has too much collage days liberal arts head games. Not enough living in the real world.
2,not what I expected,"I knew I was purchasing a used book but I did not expect it to be in such bad shape. The spine was bent, ripped,and many pages and whole sections fell out as I read the book. The pages were yellowed with age. I felt as though I had to very carefully hold the book so as not to drop the pages that had broken off from the spine or further damage the already fragile spine.The novel itself was fantastic...it was the condition of the book that I objected to."
2,Heard it already!,"While I love some of the songs on here like Byrd's 'Cowgirl', I've heard most of them a long time ago on other CD's! Besides that, a majority of the songs like 'Little Red Rodeo' have absolutely nothing to do with rodeo. There's a lot more rodeo music out there that they could have put on this album. But, if you don't have the songs, give it a shot. I hope they put out number four and return to the roots with actual rodeo songs instead of just a country compilation."
5,Nice Rememberance Of A Forgotten Comedy Duo .,"Nicely written tribute to a once popular Comedy Duo , very popular in the 1930's that was rather quickly forgotten after the team gone after the untimely death of Robert Woolsey . Well written , informative , and complete with all we need to know ."
1,disapointed,It's a beautiful book. I expected to see color patterns and instructions to knit projects including the tam on the cover. There are few patterns in this book. It's more a historical reference. I returned it.
3,Disappointing but still good 3 1/2 stars,"Detailed history of Bohus knitting, including discussion of the lives of the knitters as well as the designers. So. . . lots of text.The two most inspiring Bohus designs - Blue Shimmer and Wild Apple - are available as kits and there are lots of pics of them on the internet. There are nice photos of a few more designs and old (read not great) photos of others. Interesting and informative. Somewhat inspiring but some of the designs are not classic and scream 60's or 50's which is fine if that's what you are into.There are, however, patterns not only for blue shimmer and red apple but also for some others that I've not seen before that are very interesting and unique. Of note is that none of the designs use traditional fair isle motifs but, as would be expected, modern Scandinavian.Don't get me wrong--it's a nice book. But it really does not live up to all the hype about it."
4,Fun for my preschool classroom,"I purchased this hopscotch for my preschool classroom. I have only used it inside, and so far it has held up well. It's a great way for the children to work on gross motor skills, social skills (such as taking turns), math skills, and the students like to take the numbers out and redo the game like a big puzzle."
5,Heaven on Earth,"I can't imagine a greater joy this holiday season for any serious American music fan than to hear and/or own this incredible CD. Such joyful playing, such technical virtuosity, such amazingly clever and fun compositions played in a way that lifts the spirits towards the heavens. Just when you think it can't get any better, it does. I feel truly blessed to hear this profound music, and wish that every person who appreciates great music - no, make that great ART - will hear it and enjoy it also.Side note: Notice how much clearer/louder the bass is on the second set. Makes me wonder if mic adjustments were made between the early and late show.Final note: This is a beautiful package - booklet, artwork, recording. In my 40+ years of playing, recording, and listening to music, I can honestly say that this is one of the Top 10 music items I've ever heard/owned. A miracle. A blessing."
1,dropouts-remixing or mastering trouble?,"I ordered this CD a week or so ago,but did not have the time to listento it until last night.I had really looked forward to this historic recording,as I have heard some of the 'tracks' before.A great live musical perfomance by renown and legendarymusical genius.But every track- except one- has a 'dropoff' or 'cutout' of the audioat the very end. I do not know whether to attribute this tothe actual copy I received, or a sloppy remixing or remasteringprocess. Even though this is a litho-screened 'factory' CD,supposedly released by a 'major' label, it has the audio qualityof a bootleg MP3. If you have ordered this CD from the same or even a different vendor, and have experienced the same issues, please leave a comment.... I would rate half or no star if I could."
5,Thelonious Monk Quarted with John colgrane at Carnegie Hall,"This recording, unearthed after nearly fifty years on old tapes found at the Library of Congress, is a national treasure that speaks to all of us, after two generations. Surely this marks the work as art in its most universal sense: something with permanence, that will (I hope) last through the ages. I understand from a little research that Billy Holiday participated in this same concert, and regret that that recording has been lost! But this one, in my opinion, gets five stars."
1,Don't buy this- copy protection is a hazard,"This is another of the EMI issues that Amazon does not alert customers that has copy protection issues. It won't play on many CD players. Research the web on this BEFORE purchase to be sure that you are comfortable with the scope of limitations with this product, and other EMI and SONY titles unless you wish to participate in the on-going bonanza of problems surrounding the latest in the misdirected efforts to contol your choices.I am going to be twisting Amazon's arm to accept my copy in return. Potentially great music wrapped in greed-ware.As far as the music goes, I'll have to pass judgement becasue it won't play on various devices that I have: linux, etc."
5,Long Live Monk!,"Usually I am wary of ""essential"" re-releases featuring Coltrane - eventually the record companies will be reduced to releasing recordings of Coltrane farting in a bathtub. However, this IS an essential CD, although it really doesn't get cooking until the second track. Coltrane sticks his neck out a bit more than on their studio recordings, playing with more energy and confidence. Monk is Monk - in command, playing songs we've heard a hundred times but making them unique. ""Evidence"", ""Bye-Ya"", and ""Sweet and Lovely"" are highlights. Recorded 50 years ago, this music sounds fresh and powerful.The liner notes are ridiculous and self-indulgent but that is only a minor quibble - pick up a copy of this CD and listen to men making music."
4,takes some time,"I bought this album with the thought that it was going to be one of the greatest things I've ever heard. It's quite good, but I wouldn't say it's exceptional. It does in my opinion take some getting used to. The first time I listened to it I really didn't like it much. Then a second time, then a third, and I started to appreciate it. It seems to me a straight ahead avant guarde album. Kind of an oxymoron I know, but that's really the only way i can describe it. I recommend it, but only to those who truly appreciate jazz. For the casual listener, this one is way too out there. It's one of those albums that you appreciate because of the technicality of the music, rather than the music itself. If you can't get to that point, you won't enjoy it. On the positive side, very mellow, very chill, and pretty out there at points, which is always cool. Solid album."
3,Fine album; a bit over-rated,"This is a good album, and should be included in an any Monk lover's collection. That said, I think it got more hype than it deserves because of how it was discovered. There is a reason Monk and Coltrane didn't do more together: To play well with Monk, you had to be flexible, and an bit, well, nutty. Coltrane at his best is awe inspiring, but he also has a lot of standard riffs. On this album much of his playing is just his standard stuff on top of Monk's wacky chord changes. With the exception of ""Monk's Mood"", there is not a lot of great interplay. Monk's solos are inspiring, as usual, but not outstanding in the context of his voluminous other recordings."
3,Overated,"I'm not a jazz officionado. My tastes in music are very eclectic. As jazz goes, I would say Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue"" is a 5 star. I don't care how long this was lost, the music is just not compelling. Buying this CD without hearing it first is an invitation to disappointment"
1,Highly Overrated,"You like repetitition, repetition, repetition: you'll love this. The musicians let fly oh so rarely. This one got hyped. I fell for it. Shame on me."
1,Monk and Trane,"Feh. This thing is an old recording. That might explain why there is certainly NOTHING new in it. Simply a collection of compositions that are so familiar to anyone with a passing interest in jazz they can be hummed while shaving. There are no insights or stellar one-off interpretations of the pieces.Chemistry? What chemistry? Alchemy is more like it, except in this case the ""Gold"" of the hype has been transformed into the ""Lead"" of the reality: flat, dull and heavy.T. Epstein"
5,Most Important Jazz Release of the Year,"Recently discovered at the Library of Congress by Larry Applebaum, this November 1957 concert documents one of the most important but otherwise under-recorded collaborations in jazz history. Previous to this find there were only three studio recordings of this quartet (with Wilbur Ware on bass) and a horrible ""audience recording"" of Monk and Coltrane at the Five Spot. So what we have here is truly historic.The Monk Quartet, in addition to Coltrane, features Ahmed Abdul-Malik (replacing Wilbur Ware) on bass and Shadow Wilson on drums. Many people believe this was the quartet at the height of their power."
5,Thelonious Rules,"Despite rumors to the contrary Thelonious Monk has not been living in a monastery. No, honestly this disc of the misplaced of 1957 Carnegie Hall performance is a respectable recording. Monk is in true form here."
5,Great Jazz!,"This is a great collection. The sound quality is better than I expected, considering it was recorded live in the 50's (using 50's equipment). Guess that says something for the acoustics at Carnegie Hall. Monk, Coltrane and the rest of the quartet are excellent. Let's hear it for the Library of Congress folks who found this tape buried away and resurrected it!"
5,Nice!!,"Kudos go out to that engineer in the Library of Congress who rescued this gem from obscurity. What an album! Monk seems at his quirky best here, bouncing around the keyboard on Epistrophy, while Coltrane alternates on tracks between ripping it up and playing it smooth and glorious. This is a great performance from two of the best musicians in jazz history. I'm on maybe ten listens so far and it's impossible to pick a stand-out track or two. They're all excellently played and as it has already been pointed out by earlier reviewers, this show is accessible to a wide range of audiences. Highly recommended!"
5,Must have,For anyone who is building a library of the greatest Jazz recordings this is a must have album.
3,terrific music BUT COPY PROTECTED,"A stunning album, as many other reviewers state here --but be warned: the CD is ""copy-controlled"" by EMI,so you WON'T be able to rip to your MP3 playerunless you have a cracker ...I'm a fair-use advocate, and have made it a point-of-principleto refuse to purchase protected CDs from the greedheads;I didn't check carefully enough on this one before buying --"
1,not what I expected,I thought I was ordering the pneumatic post and what I got was the ring which i didn't need. It cost almost as much to send back as it did to order it. Very disapointed.
1,Disappointing,"This is a horrible example of a training course. I have no IDEA why IBM recommended it for the 486 test. Unless you prefer reading info online, the CD is useless. The quizzes at the end of the chapters are subpar. You only can hit a button to see the answer after you answer every question. If you get the answer wrong it just directs you to the section of the reading - there is no explanation. You cannot go back to a previous question. The movies are just someone reading the text with a picture of the diagrams already included in the text. Dont waste your time. Get the Craig Larman or Martin Fowler books instead."
1,Exams completely unreliable...,I have only gone through 8 of the 32 exams and have already found at least 10 errors. Don't waste your time or your money.
1,Mind numbing,"This ""Ultimate Cyber Classroom"" brought back those days in college where the instructor droned on and on using very precise language whose words had only meaning within the context of the class. (Why couldn't they use the word 'hidden' rather than 'elided'? Same number of characters...)Be fair warned that the reading level of this course is over that of most people.This would have been a far better course if it had spent more time on the why's and how's rather than almost totally on syntax."
2,Project Lead,"This book do not stand to reputation of UML creators. I bought it because it has been recommended by IBM for their UML test. Now, I want to sell it fast. Any takers?"
1,Warning Defective Software,"This package comes with a reference manual and a computer based training course. The training software is defective. The setup program has remnants of the W95.CIH virus and won't install if you are running a virus checker. If you manage to get the product installed, you may find it doesn't work. The course is implemented as a set of html pages that aren't correctly linked so you'll receive many page not found errors as you click through the material. A total rip-off in my opinion."
1,The complete UML Training Course,"I have bought the book yesterday and the installaton is a nightmare and I cannot get it to install. I am using Windows 2000 and live in the United Kingdom and thus the number given below is not useful to me. This book was supposed to show how to write good reusable software. Has this product been tested, well have a guess."
3,The Complete UML Training Course,"This is NOT a training course. It's an out-of-date reference manual. I contacted the seller, but he never responded. I am much more careful now when I order from Amazon or its sellers."
1,Cannot Install The CD,"I cannot install the CD, I am using Windows 2000. I clicked on the setup and nothing happened. Could I get some help.Thanks"
5,not too shabby!,"For thirty bucks these are a fairly decent set of speakers, mounted into my 1976 plymouth fury anything was going to be a step up, but i was pleasantly surprised by the sound these output.the only issue i had was the positive clip, not the whole thing but the actually slide in connector, on one of these had broken off, dont know if it was a factory error or if it happened during shipping. Not a huge deal once i soldered the connection the speaker works just like it should."
2,Too general to help. Save your money; you really don't need this book.,"I am new to dSLR cameras and was looking for a book that would get me beyond the point and shoot world I had been living in for so many years. Basically, this book just tells you what buttons to look for on the camera and sort of what they do; but this is something my Pentax User's Manual already does in better detail. This book does try to present some principles of basic photography, but ends up doing so in broad vagaries, so do not buy it if you are looking for a clear discussion of aperture vs. ISO vs. shutter speed, etc. Buy it only if you want some direction on what buttons you should be looking for on your dSLR and nothing more. I checked out The New Manual of Photography by John Hedgecoe from the local library and found it to be infinitely more helpful and informative. I might buy that one instead, but I've already sunk $20 once, so this time I am going to be careful."
2,Not quite start-up.,"The information in this book is good, it starts almost at the beginning... but I am a beginner's beginner. Unfortunately, this book starts two weeks into the semester. The real ""start-up"" material is missing. It doesn't help the reader to know all of the terms that are being used. The glossary in the back only has some of the definitions. I am having to do some catch up just to know what is being said. It is a beautiful book with great touch appeal, however the book is literally falling apart on me. The binding is worthless, of course that would not be the author's fault. It is however very easy to read."
4,Functional Laptop Security,Works fine with enough cabling to get the item secured. Easy snap lock. Key works effortlessly. Locks good. Looks good. Would hardily recommend this item.
2,Too Small to Use,"My child received this toy as a present. I was overjoyed because I remembered playing happily with the standard-size set when I was little. But when we tried to play this travel-sized one, I realized that the game was very difficult to play because the pieces were too small. One needs super coordination to fit such complicated and small shapes into the holes - which neither me nor my 5-year-old have! So I gave this travel-sized perfection set away and bought the standard size one for my child. She enjoys it (especially fitting all of the pieces into the holes, then setting the timer and watching the pieces go up - it's nice to know that she can ""grow"" into the toy!), and I am happy with the new purchase. Moral: DON'T buy the travel-sized one. DO buy the standard-sized one."
4,Great for Travel,This product is basically a smaller version of the full size game. The only complaint I have about it is that the game pieces barely fit into the storage drawer. I struggle each time I put them away.
2,Too small and cheaply made,"This smaller version is cheaply made...the tray that pops doesn't work properly and it doesn't always ""pop"" when the time is up. In the side of the game there is a slide out drawer that holds the pieces when not being used. I got all of the 16 pieces in after a lot of jiggling and positioning, then when we tried to open the tray up, it was jammed. My husband had to unscrew the body of the game in order to open up the drawer. The game pieces are very small and it takes a lot of thumb/index finger coordination to insert them into the tray of the game. Overall, not worth the money."
1,Didn't work,Glad it wasn't expensive because it did not work for us. We could never get the timer to work to pop the tray up when time runs out. Complete waste of money.
4,Much easier for younger ones.,"We got the larger version of this game for Christmas and I bought this one as well. My 5 year old likes all the shapes, but the larger version is a little daunting. The smaller one is just right. You really have to configure the shapes properly to get them all in the little side drawer."
2,too small,"I should have paid more attention to the description of this product before making the purchase. It does say, ""Fun on the Run"" so basically what that means is that it can fit in my purse! It's a tiny version of the bigger game ""Perfection"" and my little guy, unfortunately didn't enjoy it at all.. Opted for the regular sized version."
1,Not comparable to the original,"Same comments as the rest. My kids got this as a present:*pieces barely fit into the storage drawer. So annoying!!!*timer in NO WAY gives you enough time to complete by yourself.We returned it after having it open only for one day. Looking forward to finding the original. Dont buy this. Its NOT ""Fun"" and the only ""On the Run"" you have is running it back to the store to return it."
2,not up to the original,"I bought this at a local drug store on sale for less than five dollars and still think I was ripped off. The games says it is for 5+ years but the times maxes out at just over 10 seconds. No way my 5-year old can come close to putting 16 shapes in the holes in 10 seconds or less. The ""storage"" tray does not really fit all the pieces - I can make it work but two other adults tried and gave up. It feels cheap and is just disappointing."
4,Mixed Review,"Mixed feelings about the size but not the game. When I was little I actually had Superfection and never had this one, so when I found this size on sale (like $4) I got it. I agree its harder because the pieces are really small, but I don't mind the challenge. I also agree that the drawer takes a lot of shifting to get the pieces in and still close it. But in my case, I'm older and only paid $4. If I was going to pay much more, I'd recommend the bigger version and it could be really frustrating for kids. Also, if you can still find superfection (is it still out there?) it is awsome. Uses 2-piece geometric cubes you have to put together!!"
3,already broken,"This toy is fun and easy to put away. it has a ticker that makes you race against the clock which is fun. however, the ticker is stopping in the middle before clicking off, taking away from the challenge. it was a great price, but it sticks that it didn't last much."
2,not great,"the button for the timer doesn't always work with this game, and the pieces are small enough that they can get lost very easily."
3,Small version be aware,This is tiny!! I thought it was a big version of the game but it is not. It's too small to play. The pieces don't easily fit into the storage compartment either.
2,Need an engineering degree,"I am sure they are trying to save every fraction of a penny when designing this game. Works just like the real thing only smaller. My problem is the ""Built-in storage compartment"". Frankly the pieces don't fit. Oh I am sure if I had an engineering degree from MIT I could find the optimal storage pattern to make them fit and close the door. I tried a handful of times and gave up. How is my 4 or 7 year old supposed to put this away if I can't??? There is plenty of excess space on this game that they could have made the storage larger.My low rating is based on the fact that the pieces WILL be lost since there is not proper storage."
4,bought as gift,Gift for 7 year old that appears his 4 year old brother can share with him. Arrived on time and in perfect condition.
3,Good,The item arrived timely and as described. I was very satisfied with this product. I would buy from this seller again. I didn't pay attention to the fact that this was a travel version though and was expecting the full version. That was my fault though.
3,Smaller than I thought,"I did not catch that this was for travel, the words ""on the run"" did not stand out to me. It will still be a nice and fun gift and will be able to be stored easily now I guess. I did not notice any type of travel box or bag for the car, but I also did not open the actual box yet since it is a Christmas gift for my 4 year old daughter. Hopefully there is one in there otherwise those pieces will be lost in a week!"
2,small,"i was really excited to get this for my kids i thought they would love it, but when i got it i was like where is the rest of it. lol i guess i didnt pay attention to what size it was going to be .kids are getting it for christmas hopefully they will enjoy it"
2,Lacking,"First of all, this same exact toy is at Walmart for $4.99.Second, tiny pieces... TINY.Third, not for younger kids with ANY kind of dexterity issue.Fourth, skip this one, and buy the full size version."
1,TOO MANY SHORTCUTS,"Ok, so I admit I didn't realize this was the travel version, and that alone disappointed me. But then the stickers fell off within a day, the ""storage compartment"" doesn't fit all the pieces unless you spend many many minutes working at it, the ""pop"" doesn't pop.... in total, this game is a dud."
5,Great Service!,"Had this toy as a child. I have fond memories of it. Very simple, durable toy and my child enjoys it just as much as I used to. Fast shipping, good condition, good service!"
1,not what I expected,"Bought this under the mistaken identity of another musician, who isn't even featured. Definitely not impressed. A shallow and incomplete rendition of classical selections. The featured players are talented, no question. But if I wanted a traditional intrepretation, there are better. Something more radical, please.Ronaldo El Malo"
4,Sport Medical Kit,"Just what I thought I was getting. You pay a little more for the nice canvas bag - difinetly a cut above those flismy plastic cases you normally see in this price range. A bit bulky, but considering all the ""stuff"" you get, not a problem. Plus even a liitle bit of extra room to add in your own accesories.Perfect for junior/senior youth sports. Hope it dosen't have to get used very often."
1,Stale and dated,"The high hopes I had for Fuchs' text were quickly dashed upon reading only a few lines. Singularly relying upon the existing paradigm of massacre, Mr. Fuchs fails to even consider any other of the many possible scenarios.From the outset his conclusions are revealed and clearly biased. Those biases clearly taint his method and conclusions. From an academic point of view, his evaluation and validation criteria are ambiguous at best. Finally, he relies upon far too many secondary materials and uses them as if they were without any possible error, bias or agenda.Unerring Fire is simply a rehash of the same old blame game that has been going on since April of 1864. It is NOT the ""last word"" on the Battle at Fort Pillow. Other paradigms for the battle exist and someday, with luck, they will come to publication."
1,Plagiarism?,"This book is worthless. All the author did was take other peoples work, which are based on falsehood, and pass it off as his own. Save your money and look for a factual book on Nathan Bedford Forrest."
2,Factual But Not Functional,"The author has his facts and the story he tells is probably the closest to actually what happened at Fort Pillow. However, there is way too much repetition in the book and the reader gets the feeling that the author had a dictionary in front of him searching for words to put on the pages to impress. A good read should not have the reader constantly looking up the meanings of words. This reviewer is well-read and well-educated but there were words in this book never seen before---or probably again. As far as Nathan Bedford Forrest being responsible for the actions of his men---he should have been the one held accountable whether he personally directed the killings of those seeking surrender or his men acted irresponsibly on their own (which is doubtful). His actions during the truce were at the least unethical. The reader can get all the information required from this book in the first 50 pages and use the dictionary a few times."
1,Yankee Has Biased Axe To Grind,"Undoubtly the worst book ever written on any event concerning the ""War of Northern Agression"".Mr. Fuchs has an axe to grind and from the start simply vomits forth preconceived undocumented personal views of what he believed occurred over 140 years ago.He somehow knows exactly what was in the minds of certain Confederate leaders and sets out to create a story around an unfounded lie that he believes.Don't waste your money here, a roll of even a cheap brand of toilet paper removes waste better than the pages of this book did."
2,"Nice card, annoying support","The three weeks that this card functioned it was good. I bought it to replace an ATI Radeon 9700 Pro that was destroyed in a house fire. My concern is with VisionTek's warranty. To have my newly deceased card serviced I have to send the card, with $10 dollars, to their service center and wait three weeks. They refuse to send out a replacement, so my computer is worthless to me during that time. Anyone who spends that much on a video card actually USES their computer. I will not buy from VisionTek again."
2,Beware! Poor Customer Support,"I purchased another VisionTek video card (model 5564) just 8 months ago, and I have to say that I'm not terribly pleased with the company's committment to customers. When I installed Microsoft Flight Simulator, it wouldn't detect my video card; so like any well-trained consumer, I went to VisionTek's site to download the latest drivers. But lo and behold! VisionTek's site offers no drivers or support for any model prior to the 9100, when they switched from Nvidia chips to ATI chips. The support that _is_ available is sketchy at best--two FAQs and a forum, where strangely, there's no place to post questions on any earlier product either. When I wrote their customer service organization for help, the advice I received was a one-line response suggesting I update the drivers. Before you purchase this, or any, VisionTek product, go to their website and see if it's likely to help you when you run into trouble."
1,Damaged; poor follow up,"I ordered this item from one vendor, and returned it when it arrived damaged. The interesting thing is that when the original vendor took FOREVER sending me another lamp, I ordered it from another vendor, and received an identical lamp, WITH THE IDENTICAL DAMAGE. It appears that the shipper simply restocked the lamp, and sent it out again. What a mess!. The delay has cost me productivity, and I am unlikely to use this mode of shopping again."
3,Quiet weirdness,"Sam Bardfeld is the violinist with the Jazz Passengers, an ensemble that specializes in surreal comic-strip jazz cabaret (their masterpiece remains _In Love_, which features an all-star lineup of vocalists including Jimmy Scott, Jeff Buckley and Mavis Staples put together by Hal Willner). The Passengers seem to be missing in action lately, at least in the recording studio, so it's nice to hear this disc, which has some Passengerish elements in the inclusion of a suitably off-the-wall narrative involving Saul, an aspiring krummhorn player. But the main thing here is the slightly twisted take on contemporary jazz--it's got a great sound, with a front line of violin, trumpet (Ron Horton) & vibes (Tom Beckham). There's a lovely cover of Serge Gainsbourg's ""Je t'aime... moi non plus"" included here, and though it doesn't quite bowl me over as an album it's nonetheless a consistently enjoyable listen."
5,so ROMANTIC so Sexy,it has one of the most romantic climax of a story that I almost cried. Romantic hero meets romantic heroine in Long Island NY. The better one of the TRIO of the Steele Men stories: The Protector. The Hotshot. and my favorite The Seducer.
5,Seriously romantics Read This,"The romantic Steele Brother, Rex, attempts to fall for a woman (his realtor) he only knows by voice on the phone. This book, part of the BIG APPLE BACHELORS trio, reads like those of historic romance novels. A little DRAMA about hero/heroine willing to sacrifice him/herself to save their loved one. how romantic...still very sexy."
5,"Solid Performer, Clarity and Power","Great Pickup for clarity and solid tonal response. Comes with basic and custom wiring diagrams that took 20 minutes to install, run the wires (plenty of wire), solder into a basic 3 way switch, and close it all back up.The wiring diagram labels each wire and 4 different wiring variations for custom work to get tones you are after for more complex wiring setups. All is covered in the instructions along with 2 screws and springs if you need them. My Ibanez stock screws fit fine and made a direct swap even easier.It has a bright solid tone that has clarity and has plenty of power- bite. Nice low end that is not too heavy for solid mids.An individual allen wrench is provided to adjust each pickup pole height for every string."
1,unpratical,"the spells are written in a way that make them look ""magical""but at the end you will hardly use any of themi recommend you not to buy thisin fact that are many FREE spells available on the internetthis book does not teach you how to create your own spells or have you properly understanding the nature of it.so might as well just look it up on the net"
2,new to the craft? you will enjoy,"a fun and easy read,any one curious or just want to have fun, should read this book. good for a beginner to the craft."
3,Hard for beginners,"This book looks very cute to display, but has very difficult spells, that require items such as a moonstone or gold or silver coins, and other things that can't be found around the house. It's not a good first time book, especially for someone like me who wanted a spell book to start with. It's illustrated with cartoons, and doesn't seem liek it will actually show any resutls. A good gift for a non-believer."
2,"cute, pretty, but not a keeper...","i enjoyed getting this book out of the library to look at, but it just wasn't a keeper, although being an artist i'm tempted to buy it simply for it's design qualities. the spells are good,yes, but it's really a book aimed at dabblers who want something that looks *magickal*. it was a fun read, but not worth the money. ah well, eh? ^_^"
2,Not worth the money,"While this book is very nice looking, it's not truly helpful. The spells are foolish, and probably best suited for those who aren't familiar with the practice. Why? Because the spells themselves aren't practical, and in my opinion, are poorly written. While the author chooses to contantly preach about the ethics of practicing witchcraft this book would be best suited to 'fluffy bunnies'. Perhaps some of the spells are workable, but it's not necessary to have use such impractical materials. Personally, I think if you choose to purchase this book you'll find it much more useful if you simply take any ideas you might like and incorporate them into a spell you've written; you'll probably get more accomplished this way."
1,"Nothing I can really use,","i thought this book would have better spells in it, but I was wrong. It had pretty pictures, and it gave a lot of detail of different typs of magic, but nothing that a twenty some thing like myself can really use on the day to day."
3,Spells,Book took a month to be delivered. Some pages were missing.I guess this is what I get for buying used product.
2,Okay book,"This book is more entertaining than useful. It has nice pictures and includes different spells from different countries (which was neat). But, overall it wasn't really practical."
4,You'll Love it!,"It is a great book,even though the spells are a little hard to find it is a great BOOK!!!!!! If you know any other spells that are not in this book, E-mail me!!!!!!"
4,In Tuned w/nature,"This book lets you get in tuned with the natural things in life. Let nature take it's course. Everything in this book is crafts for the good things in life that we sometimes take for granted. So have no fear (no evil spells), it's all good and natural. Relax and enjoy!"
1,Not Very Helpful To Anyone Who is Not A Beginner,"This book, while amusing to page through, was not a keeper! I did enjoy the photographs and the mythology that was presented, but I found that I could devise spells on my own that had more continuity and clarity than those offered. Overall, I would say that if you have no working knowledge of the craft, this is a good book to look at but not to buy. If you are versed in the Ancient Ways, this book can be only something to avoid or to amuse you with it's backward attempts at sharing 'ancient practices' with the general herd population."
3,very pour,Yes i do own this book personally i think its realy bad. i am now a satanist because i found white magic shockin. O.K for white magicians NICE PICTURES
4,A wonderful first witchcraft book!,"This is a wonderful book for any one! It was simply written, cute and UNDERSTANDABLE. We bought a different book ( our first one ) and it was a mistake. It was extremely confusing, having way to much information mixed together. This book has a wonderful author, ( who seems to understand what its like for a beginner trying to read a complecated book ), and she's made the spells simple and easy to follow. Definately a keeper!"
2,Hello People,I don't know much about the craft but I know there are more in-depth books on the market. What I need is a FREE book or site that has FREE love spells so I can get to work. Can anyone help? If you can e-mail me at daisydew18@hotmail.com. I need soething simple and something that works FAST.
2,Dull Interface,"I bought the software for my extremely bright 8 year old daughter and found it little better than reading Wikipedia. Perhaps it might be more appropriate for an older kid who was already had a passion for engineering but if you are trying to inspire your child's interest in the world then don't waste his or her time. This is not a very good product.The visuals are small and interactivity is minimal; and yes I do think I could have done a better job.I found the most recent version of ""Amazing Body"" a much better buy. It is interactive and requires engagement from the child. Way better visuals and interface as well."
1,Failed expectations,I bought it for my son. We put it on the computer and tried to figure out what to do with this. I thought he'll be able to be educated from this. But it was not freindly organized and there was no sensible order to the stuff there.We never played with this after that 1st time.
2,buy the book,I have poor comprehension skills. I was hope that the information would jump out at me but it did not.
2,you get what you pay for!! If that!!!,"Basically this thing is a piece of junk. I can see my 8"" sub blowing this thing apart in about an hour it's ""high quality construction"" consists of about 1/2"" thick cardboard tube with a 3/4"" particle board end cap & covered with a felt-like material . The bass reflex vent is a plastic cap with a cardboard (toilet paper roll) extension. The power handling peak printed ON THE BOX reads 100 watts peak!!! Do yourself a favor & pay a little more for a better name cause Pyramid ain't cutting it. By the way this so called enclosures description does not indicate that it is an empty tube (no sub), but that should be obvious at the price but just wanted to share that. should make a good flame in the fire pit!!!"
5,Beautiful,"My brother's mother in-law LOVES marcasite, and with her being a first time grandmother, this was the perfect gift since it is a locket. The picture does not do this piece justice. It is gorgeous and the locket hinge is sturdy and easy to open. I highly recommend this necklace. She loves it!"
4,:),"The chain that comes with the locket is of a very poor quality. Make sure that you have your own chain to put it on. The locket itself is beautiful. It feels heavy in your hand. I have not noticed any opening/shutting issues that were mentioned in other reviews. The back of this locket is not as decorative as the front, it is very smooth and shiny on the back. That doesn't bother me, but I thought it might bother some of you. Overall I am very satisfied."
2,Nice necklace for the money.,"You get what you pay for. This is a decent necklace. The chain is very cheap and the locket feels a little loose when you open it. Other than that it looks nice on. All in all it's decent for the price. I bought it as a gift for someone and it (of course) looks much better here then when I got it in person but it will still nice enough. It's only $30, and I'd say it's worth that."
4,cross necklace 9gift),"it is just as it appears in picture , it is a Christmas gift so we have not worn it yet"
5,nice 60's collection,"Overall a good selection of original sixties songs, every one a good one. Sometimes a collection has one or two in it that you don't care for, but this one is a very good one. My 5th graders even love listening to it, they especially love It's a Wonderful World by Louis Armstsrong."
3,Domestic comedy,"This Hayworth's movie is a domestic comedy, but a vey charming one. The performance of Brian Aherne is excelent and Rita looks like a future movie star."
3,Lesson: Don't judge a book by its cover.,"Doesn't the moist chocolate cake on the cover look delicious? Don't you wish you knew how to make a wonderful vegan chocolate cake that was moist and rich? Well, I'm sorry to say, you won't learn it from this book. Although, the book is full of new ways to prepare old favorites, if you are an American, the European terms, serving sizes and flavor combinations may be a bit of a turn-off. However, if you are the adventurous type, you may welcome the new taste experience. Just, do yourself a favor, and stay away from the chocolate cake."
2,Defective recipe,"I wanted to contact Leah Leneman directly, but find no contact information online. The only three things a recipe book has to get right, ultimately, are the list of ingredients, the amount of each ingredient, and the baking time. The cornbread recipe in this book is wildly wrong about the latter two. It called for about a third as much liquid as it actually needed, and at half an hour in the oven, at 425, it was starting to burn even though the recipe called or an hour at that temp! Who ever heard of baking cornbread for an hour at such a high temp anyway."
3,SOME GOOD KUNG FU,"This is a good sequel and fine kung fu movie, period. Its not one of the greatest, but it does a fair job of representing the talents of Jet Li and Corey Yuen Kwai, although both have done far better movies together. Some of the middle lags, and the final fight needed some spice (the finale of the original Fong was superior). Still, for the kung fu fan, it is well worth watching."
3,"Lots of fun, but not as good as the first","The final fight in this movie must be seen to be believed. Actually most of the fight scenes must be seen to be believed. Therein lies the problem...the rest of the movie (i.e. the story, the characters, etc) aren't really missed. The fights scenes are fantastic, but without any coherent reason for there to be a fight going on, it takes away from the enjoyment."
1,Disappointed,"There are much better books about addiction out there. I found this book boring. Try reading Smacked by Melinda Fergusen or Hard Candy, Leaving Dirty Jersey etc.. if you are looking for the real, gritty stuff. This book hardly touched on any raw emotion or details, total snooze-fest!!"
3,it looked pretty.. flower leaves broke,"yes, it does look very nice, several piece still nice after years but the leaves of the flowers one by one broke and i do not even moved it anywhere except for cleaning"
2,ARRIVED BROKEN WASTE OF MONEY,It arrived broken and was not happy with it at all. Very small did not even bother to waste my time returning it.
1,"Boring, boring, boring!!!!!","Ms. Weideger may have thought she was writing an equivalent to ""A Year in Provence"" or ""Under the Tuscan Sun,"" but she hasn't. I was terribly disappointed, and bored beyond belief. This is the opposite of a page-turner. You get no real sense of the wonder and magic of the city she claims, unconvincingly, to love. But you do get seven pages on how she manages to sort out her computer problems. She is, by her own description, a nightmare of a tenant, and the book's only suspense is one's mounting curiosity as to what she will do next in the way of petty meanness to her landlords--and how long they will put up with her before they throw her out."
2,Venetian nightmares,"Venetian Dreaming started out so strong. Weidiger did an admirable job of describing her longing to live in this most enigmatic of cities, and of the many logistical and personal roadblocks she had to overcome to achieve the dream. Then, a bit less than halfway through this engaging story, the dream becomes a nightmare. The author became fixated upon not just living in Venice, but upon living in one particular apartment in one particular palazzo. No matter what. Other reviewers have covered the many flaws that spoil this book at this point. Just another few words on the ending. Talk about leaving the reader hanging! What was that all about? Hope she's OK now. Hard to believe this book got published in its present form."
1,An awful snob in Venice,"After a week in Venice I wanted to live there forever. Picking up this book to read on the plane home, I hoped to see the city through other eyes and put my own dream into perspective. It starts well: the reader empathises with the Venetian disease Weinbereg catches. Half way through this book turns into a nasty diatribe against some Venetians and many expatriates. The author seems to think her closing section on a car-crash in Italy and its aftermath will make up for her bile. It doesn't, it won't.If I ever do live in Venice I fervently hope never to encounter this snobbish, garrulous and self-centered New Yorker. The book is not only a waste of money, but an offense to Venice and to readers. How on earth did this get published?"
2,"Well, she's certainly memorable","If you love Venice, as I do, you'll open this book with delight, eager to be transported back to vistas dominated by calles and canals.By about page 75, though, you'll notice your enthusiasm has ebbed, and you've been seized by a curious urge. You're fantasizing -- and not for the first time -- about drowning the narrator in one of those canals.Given that Weideger comes off as catty, shallow, snobbish, whiny and incompetent on nearly every page IN HER OWN MEMOIR, one shudders to imagine what she's like in real life."
4,Everyday Venice,"If you are looking for a Venetian travel view thru rose-colored glasses, skip this book. If you are interested in what it would be like to live or spend significant time there, it is worthwhile to read. While I would not want to spend time with the author, and I suspect many who did have lived to regret it, she does give an inside view of Venice, Ca'Donà (the only Venetian Palace still occupied by the family that built it), and the Venetian expat community. Her description of the real-life family of Ca'Donà and the challenges they face with their inherited Venetian Palace is fascinating. You will not get this kind of info from your travel guide."
1,Basta Cosi,"Never have I read such a mean spirited book about the most beautiful city in the world. Half way through, I had to put it aside because I couldn't stand reading about the author's demands of her landlady. I have rented apartments in Italy and never, once, have I encountered anyone less than charming and helpful. This is not to say that travel memoirs are supposed to be happy, and delightful but a little restraint would have helped the reading experience. I have the impression that she was mostly miserable while she was there and if she was enthralled, it didn't show on the page. A much better Venice book is ""A Thousand Days In Venice"" written with great enthusiasm and a true love of the place. If you're going to live in Italy, you are not entitled to complain!"
3,"Amusing, bitchy, interesting...","I picked the book up in order to remind myself of the fabulousness of Venice. And it did just that. However, I also got a big kick out of the author. She is hilariously judgemental and bitchy! Her accounting of her landlord makes me want to root for the landlord! Seems like a gal I'd love to have a cocktail with, but would hate to have as a mom. My fiance and I are heading to Italy for our honeymoon. It'll be his first time to Venice, and my second. I don't think the book was brilliant, but it was amusing, nonetheless."
1,How not to be popular in Venice....,"Venice is my favorite city, and I am always interested in the lives on those who have been fortunate enough to live there - sort of to ""test drive"" if I could do the same thing. But the author goes out of her way to alienate and offend so many people that I don't really think there's much to be learned from her.Even the descriptions of Venice are so fraught with her insecurities, opinions and prejudices that you don't get a good sense of the beauty and wonder of the city. Just lengthy diatribes about her landlord, her computer, her apartment, her neighbors, her problems with this person and that person etc. etc.Anybody fortunate enough to have the flexibility to live in a different city for a period of time should take a little bit of flexibility and a decent sense of humor with them. The author seems to lack both, and this makes the book very difficult to read without wincing."
1,Venetian Dreaming,"Paula Weideger does a disservice to the millions of people who go to Venice every year. She has creamed off the charm and left us with her social-climbing nastiness. I couldn't believe the way she trashed so many people, including some whom I have found to be delightful and certainly more charming than the impression one get's of Ms. Weideger. Such disparagement does not help us understand either her experience or the Venice she found. While obviously a capable writer, the author could have given us a book that feeds our interest in Venice, rather than leave us with the bones of her greedy feast."
3,A Venice Lover? Not Really!,"As one who has lived in Venice for twenty years, and who knows the characters described in the book, (almost without exception in unflattering terms), as well as the places and experiences described, I can only wonder if Ms. Weideger had managed to learn Italian before attempting to write a book about Venice and the Venetians, if she would have been able to present a more positive picture. I found, like a previous reviewer, that the book was indeed a ""wallow in self-pity.""It is too bad because the author writes extremely well, but she has a negative, almost hostile edge to her prose that colors the entire book."
4,deadly explorations,"Jared McCaverty is the main character of this book. He lives in wealth, his father is a dentist, his grades are good. He has everything to be happy, and yet there is something eating him. Jared fancies boys. He has had a few encounters, always discovered by his father who, in response, used to whip his son.In the book, Jared meets Julian Clay, the new curator of the local museum. Clay is impressed with Jared, his intellect...and his looks. On a trip to purchase a new piece for the exhibition, they eventually will have sex. Jared will learn to use this experience as a very powerful weapon. In the end, it is even suggested that Julian Clay, who committed suicide, did so because Jared threatened to expose him as a rapist.All in all a very interesting book on the puberty of a young boy living in Indiana (hence the title). Recommended."
4,Good basic resource in a useful format,"Bestseller in 30 Days and Publish in 30 Days provide the basics, listing many good web resources and a lot of good practical advice from one who's done it successfully. In general, both books read as though they were put together in a bit of a hurry, but I have to admit, using the book as reference as I market my book, Your Chicken is Cooked, I'm finding helpful information at every step. And many of her hints are guerrilla tactics not available elsewhere.Also, I thought Ms Reiss' advice to embellish one's planned publication list, pretending to be a large publisher to qualify for CIP listing bordered on unethical. Or maybe it's just the natural reaction/peaceful protest of frustrated small publishers tired of receiving discrimination from the Library of Congress, an organization that should be helping them to be heard!"
5,"If This Doesn't Work, Nothing Will","I can't tell you how often I hear desperate authors asking how to make their books sell. Now I have an answer. Read this book, and do as it says.Even if your book was published by one of the big New York publishers, the chances are that its fate is up to you. So, by all means, work with the publicist assigned to you, but also get this book and take charge of your own destiny.If you follow all of the tips and leads in this book, and you still haven't made a ton of sales, then you have incredibly bad luck. The method can even, although with more difficulty, be applied to fiction. And, as with the other books in the series (Publish A Book in 30 Days and Find an Agent in 30 Days), the activities are divided into 30 manageable packages, with clear and concise directions."
5,Very helpful and useful!,"As the compiler of a recently published book ...I still was able to glean much useful information (such as creating a buzz for a book, free online news release services, distribution to libraries, etc.) from The Publishing Game. And, as other reviewers have similarly commented, wish I knew about this book before playing ""The Publishing Game."""
1,the pervading darkness,"How did we get to the point where we want to be entertained by this type of thing? Who wants these images in their head? The sick and the numb, the curators of a violence-obsessed society teetering on the brink of a total morality vacuum. Wes Craven provides us with yet another example of the disintegration of our culture and values, the pervading darkness poisoning our minds."
1,Sick.,"I watched this film expecting perhaps a good horror movie. Imagine my surprise when I started watching it. I don't know why I watched this film really. It was that disgusting. A young girl gets raped (they spend a lot of time on the rape scene, maybe up to 5 minutes, making it as nasty and gross as possible). And at the end they microwave him. No point other than to show an innocent girl get brutally raped by a psychopath. Sick stuff for anti-social freaks. A true sign of cultural degeneration in our time."
1,sick twisted,"This is a sick and twisted movie with nothing new, except the sick minds that made it, Don't waist your time. Its over done., and becomes boring to where you wish it hurry up and end."
3,awareness is safer,"young women ARE at risk. They should know. As a parent, I hope I could do what these folks did."
4,Last House on the Left,My husband and I enjoyed this movie. It was full of supense and a wonderful illustration of how fair one would go to protect themself.
4,Last House remake not quite as good as original,This Last House remake is a very good movie. I would recommed it to anyone. It kept my interest throughout the movie.The only problem I had with this remake is the fact that in the original Last House the two girls were very attractive. I found in this remake the girls were not that attractive at all. I suppose that was done on purpose but I found it detracted from my enjoyment of this remake. I went back and watched the original afterwards and thought it a better movie.The thing I really liked was how this remake and the original movie were different. Why remake a movie if it is exactly the same.Over all I give the remake 4 stars. The origianl 5 stars.KC.
5,last house on left,the movie was very good and not stupid like some of the horror films i've seen in the past. It accutally had a good director and the movie had a plot.
3,Good remake.,"This was a very good remake. In fact its much better made than the original. But it is lacking the shock value of the first one. It's a better 'film' overal, but there is something more real about the old one. It's worth owning both."
2,"DENNIS ILIADIS, OPUS 2","Above average slasher movie. Well photographed with convincing actors. What I didn't like at all, it's the point of view of the director which is borderline voyeuristic in the rape scene and in the way he films Mari and Paige. Already forgotten."
1,This isn't the best remake.,"Nothing beats an original. This is one of the worst remakes i've seen. The actors are horrible. The only thing cool are the death and how detailed it gets in. But anyways, its a lame remake.Nothing does beat an original.""Just keep telling yourslef Its Only A Movie."". I kinda wish it wasnt"
1,Big Disappointment,"I so wanted to like this movie. I love a good scary movie, but this really isn't it. I feel asleep twice during this movie--that should tell you all you need to know."
2,Disappointing,"I am not a Wes Craven fan, never saw the original and sorry that I watched this. I had to skip a lot of it because of gore. If this is Wes Craven, I won't watch another."
3,WARNING: Eat NO popcorn during presentation....,"Remake of old film, better version....I prefer to see 'victims' stand up against the bad guys instead of being wimpy, but that effort includs parts (which I won't reveal here) that are, well....GROSS...but then I'm old and I like '6th grade' endings. Acting is decent by the leads."
2,"Brutal, stupid and unsatisfying","While the 70s original was brutal and cruel it had some clever psychology, horror and conflicts. But this version sheds anything interesting in favor of more brutality including an on-camera rape, bloody fist fights and beatings.The final half of the movie has nothing clever, just unending fist fights between the parents and the criminals.Give it a miss."
1,Movie download,I ordered this movie from two places trying to watch it on my big screen TV. All I can do is watch it on my computer. Didn't watch it. It was on TV on Spike a day later.Paid $9.99 and I think $2.00 for the movies. Not to happy.
3,"Ok, but I've seen better!!","I saw this movie last night and like it fairly well. However it did remind me of another movie which I thought was a lot more exciting. If you haven't ever seen the cult classic mother's day then you won't know what I'm talking about. Both movies involve scenes of rape and torture, but I think mothers day doesn't take it too seriously and that is what makes it more watchable. I haven't seen the '72 version so I can't compare these two films. Also the only person I think that would enjoy the rape scenes are someone like Ted Bundy or the Hillside Stranglers. I guess they get the intended reaction in making you want to go beat every rapist in the world with a ball bat until their eyeballs pop out so I guess the director and writer can be commended for this powerful involving horror fest."
2,Another pointless Hollywood remake. Hollywood holds no creativity anymore.,This is like a severely watered down version of the original and it is far less shocking. The original was so scary and so real and so sick that I think if I ever saw one of the actors in it I would run as though a member of the Manson family showed up. It was that bad. Almost like watching Faces of Death or something. Really creepy and just evil. I wouldn't watch it again alone or in the wrong frame of mind. This remake barely evokes anything close to that. And I find it funny that in 2009 the filmmakers didn't dare have the mother take a bite out of crime so to speak like in the original. Those of you giving this a glowing review in comparison to the Wes Craven version are delusional if not connected to the production or something.
5,best re make in years,Watched this picture a few days ago and it is simply facinating in the mood it creates.The original was in all fairness brilliant for it's time but a re make for the new generation was long overdue and boy did they get it right.The rape scene is extremely tough to stomach and the gore factor is certainly not easy on the eyes but the revenge driven parents are a joy to watch for fans of this genre.Very satisfying ending.For the few out there who have not seen the original i would reccommend watching this version and please keep an open mind.To summarize...this picture can be extremely disturbing from time to time but the end result makes the ride worthwhile.Keep a special place in your mind for this style of horror/thriller as it won't leave you easily.Definitely one for the books.
2,Not Impressed,"I really thought this was going to be something amazing based on the trailer. I wasn't a big fan of the original, but this looked interesting. I like a lot of the new remakes that have bee coming out.This is a well made film. And I appreciate that a lot of the original cheese was removed. The rape scene was appalling and unless I just supressed the memory of the first film, it's much worse. Given the horror of what Mary endures, I didn't feel like the kill/revenge scenes were as satisfying as the original. I felt the parents often bumbled around and made a lot of cliché horror movie mistakes. It's definitely an intense movie that keeps you on the edge of the seat, but I also heard myself screamng ""OH COME ON!"" an awful lot.If anyone is interested, the Italian film, Night Train Murders (1975) was a much better rip-off of Last House on the Left."
3,Decent remake,"Pretty strong and a better made 'movie' in a technical sense than the original. But the original still is more powerful and, a stronger movie over all as far as 'effect'. Worth your time though. Good horror film."
3,"BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL, BUT THAT'S NOT SAYING MUCH! 2 1/2 STARS!","If ever there was a film that had room for improvement the original ""Last House On The Left' surely fits the bill. While this remake is better on many levels, it doesn't really pack the punch of the original in certain areas. The remake has better acting and is much slicker with better FX, but I didn't think it felt as brutal. That's not to say this is a bad thing as I really don't need to see graphic rapes scenes in a film for them to have an impact. One curiosity is they cut the most memorable scene from the original when on of the intruders gets his......well...""you know what"" bit off! This is somewhat redeemed at the end of the film when the father gives the last surviving intruder the ""Jiffy Pop"" treatment!......Popcorn anyone? ;-b"
3,An extra star for the effort,"I'm sure this remake was well-intentioned, and while it did stick to the basic premise of the original, it really did fall flat in terms of how much dislike was built up for the criminals and how much satisfaction was built up in the parents' response. It wasn't boring, but not nearly as disturbing as the first LHOTL. For some reason, things were tamed down a great deal, and it was an overall detriment to the film. An updating of the original, with all shocks intact, would've been far more effective."
1,Nothing New,"Without comparing or holding this up to the original, this film is a below average horror film that brings absolutely nothing new or exciting to the horror genre. It is well made and acted but with a budget over ten million, I should hope so.If you are a die-hard horror fan with time to kill and are interested give it a rent."
1,Too Much,"This movie wasn't much of a horror movie or scary at all. It was just a bunch of murder and violence. And the rape scene was absolutely awful, they showed it for way too long, the girl actually looked like she was being raped. It made me sick and I had to walk out of the room during the scene. Such realistic rape scenes should not be made for entertainment."
3,Good But Not Easy To Watch,"I never saw the orginal and only heard about this one through a friend of mine at work. I found it ok. I was never really scared or terrified by anything that was going on but the rape scene was incredibly hard to watch and felt like it was going on for a good hour even though it had to have been only like 5 or 10 minutes long and in that regard I was left with an overall feeling of unease.While there is the death scenes that occur after the parents find out the ppl staying in their guest house attacked their daughter, I wouldn't really say this is a horror film in the way one tends to think of them. To me it's more of a human emotional drama but to each their own.And while you want to cheer the parents on for getting their revenge, you never feel that justice had been done.All in all, it is a good movie and worth seeing if you're the type of person who can handle watching these kinds of scenes."
1,Rape scene was all I could remember,I don't remember much about the movie other than I felt discussing a gross after the rape scene. That is the only reason I will NOT watch it again. It was awful and because of that one scene ( that felt like it was going on for 30 minutes) I give the movie one star. I don't remember much else about the movie.
5,last house,"I really enjoyed the original 1972 Last House on the Left. I wasn't surprised when I saw the preview for this remake. A lot of the movies that been coming out are remakes of old films or films from Japan and Korea. Anyway, I wanted to see Last House because I was curious how it would be in comparison to the original.I liked the movie. Good acting and it kept me on the edge of my seat. It's cool how Sara Paxton went from a movie like Aquamarine to a movie like this."
1,Disgusting!!,"I really was in the mood to watch a horror film when my husband and I rented this. I was SO terribly disappointed. We watched the unrated version and I thought the rape scene was WAY too much. I'm all for blood and gore but come on. The rape scene goes on for 5 minutes and I was ready to shut the movie off, but I grabbed the cover of the DVD and read what happens. I got excited to see what the parents were going to do to these idiots. I was disappointed, never scared and really thought the movie was just bad. I would not recommend this to ANYONE! I really can't believe anyone thought this was a good movie. Disturbing!"
2,Size matters,Some of the balls are too small and roll through the hole before you can hit them with the hammer
4,"Fun, but lots of plastic.","My daughter is 7 MO at this point and under the recommended age, but she has fun pressing the balls through and seeing them pop out the bottom. She'll then 'taste' the ball, and when done she'll pass it to our kitten who will then play with it around the room. Kitten looses the ball, the baby will 'pop' out another, repeat.My MAIN beef with this product is that it's advertised as wooden, but most of it is plastic. The mallet is wooden and WONDERFULLY sturdy. As is the 'base' of the box. However the balls and the top of the bench are plastic, which was somewhat of a disappointment. On the PLUS side, that makes the balls a lot less painful when thrown on your foot by an overenthusiastic baby."
4,Visit to Italy,"The DVD follows the film maker's trips around Italy and includes home movies taken by various Italians which give a certain intimacy to the DVD. It isn't a glitzy promotion of some tour company's offerings which is usually the case, but instead, a closer look into the scenes and people of a wonderful country."
1,Chinese Karate = Misnomer,"Secrets of Chinese KarateLike the stereotypical martial art book, Secrets of Chinese Karate begins with a foreword by a student, who wouldn't say a bad word or have an independent thought, and a couple dozen pages of the system's history/lineage. The actual content of the book consist of a few basic kicks, hand strikes, stances and conditioning techniques. Also, it includes some of the ancient traditions of Chinese martial art teachers to test potential students by a series of various methods, but they are as factual as the methods of Pai Mei from Kill Bill 2. The only thing unique about this book is has the two man set/kata."
4,Classic text,"This work is based on the teachings of James Wing Woo, one of Parker's instructors in Southern Chinese Kung Foo. Most of the writing was done by Woo and the pictures are line drawings of him in action. The set in the back was created by Woo. It really has very little to do with Karate at all, or Parker for that matter.-Jess O"
4,Pleasantly surprised by this product,"I was shopping by pricepoint and this product provided a lot more value than I anticipated. There seem to be a million different Digital Frame brands out there these days, and I think this brand is a well kept bargain secret"
4,nice product,its very handy but you must know it can't just light anything on fire so use dryer lint or cotton balls but besides that it can be used at night to signal peopleover all its very good for the price.
3,Bad zipper,It's very roomy and rugged. But the zipper constantly gets snagged. Not worth the money with flaws as important as zipper function.
2,"Not a ""must have"" for True Voivodians","This live album was supposedly recorded in Sweden before or after the van accident in which Eric Forrest was injured in. This is the only official live album Voivod has ever released. This live recording is not their best effort in recording their live shows. This recording has very similar mix as the ones appered on 'Negatron', 'Phobos' and 'Kronik'. True Voivodians would be disapointed and would not appreciate how Eric Forrest sang on the older Voivod songs such as ""Tribal Conviction"", ""Nuclear War"", ""Ravenous Medicine"", ""Voivod"" and ""The Prow"". After Eric Forrest recovered from the accident in circa 2000, he later sued Piggy and Away for no apparent reason over the accident. He left the band in 2001. The band disbanded for a short period of time from there."
2,"Voivod ""Lives"" after this one!","Not real fond of Snake's replacement. The return of Belanger and addition of Newsted gave me renewed interest in this band and I can't get enough. Musically, ""Lives"" is not too bad, but Forrest is terrible."
1,Hopefully the neighbours will say...,"...Please shut up and go away! Predictable, dull and uninspired trash pop, marketed for mass appeal presumming the masses lose all intelligence when music is on the cards. There is simply nothing worthy to say about this kind of contrived and trite genre and the sooner it stops the better!"
1,just bad,i thought they were going to have good music but their is all stupid british crap rock/pop music compelety uninteresting
1,Hmmm...,"There are much more talented people around than Girls Aloud (GA). Actually, do GA even have any talent to start with?"
3,Love YES Music No Matter What.!,"Hey Luciano, Can I get a copy of your homemade DVD.?? I'd love to see all of Jons interaction and introductions to the songs.Excellent performance, but I did miss Chris Squires presence. He is a dominant force and works best with Jon Anderson."
3,Not the complete concert,Don't be fooled by the two re-releases of this great Shoreline Mountain View California concert; they edit out John Anderson's intro at the beginning as well as his rapport with the audience inbetween songs. They also do NOT offer any improvement in audio or video quality. The original dvd release is STILL the version to own.
4,almost yes,"i remembering goin to see this show in 89 and really looking forward to its release, sure i was skeptical sometimes things are not as great as you remembered. this is definately not the case here!!! its alot better than i thought the recording as well as the show. besides not having tony levin there is nothing to complain about. even though it isnt the classic lineup the show is amazing i highly recommend it. i enjoyed it so much more than the new release from the 2003 montreaux show and the other latter day efforts"
4,PLUS WHAT????,"I am a huge YES fan. I had this on pre-order, and I would like to knowwhat the difference is from the same item that was released in 2006??Same booklet (almost), the 2006 release is Same format, 2 DVD'sand has bonus material this one don't have. Search for ""An evening of YesMusic Plus"". The one released Aug 2007 is this single DVD version with'PLUS Nothing"". It is missing the Bonus material, including the last twosongs.Everything else appears to be identical. Format, Sound. Why do they dothis? I don't understand. Well, back it goes. I have the 2 DVDAn Evening of Yes Music Plus""Evening of YES MusicPlus"" with Plus. Then again, I have to give it 1 more star if youfigure the tiny bit more ""Plus"" you get is $48, verses $13 for this one..."
1,Errors galore!,"I think I am the first guy who is doing proof-reading of this book. There are so many typographical errors, wrong names of the fixed tables/views/packages. For almost everything I had to go back to the Oracle Documentation to confirm the names.The content is real good but errors are frustrating!"
4,The Ultimate 10g New Features Book,"Certainly this book is badly edited, but though the countless typos are a nuisance they do not make Alapati's text incomprehensible. I have three Oracle 10g books lying on my desk and after scanning through all of them this is the one I decided to read cover to cover. Alapati's prose is sometimes loquacious, but he succeeds in thoroughly explaining all relevant 10g new features. I do not see any alternative to this book for people who are preparing for the OCP exam and I am sure that I will often turn to it as a reference."
3,Way too many typos and errors.,"I am amazed at how many typos and mistakes are in this book. It makes me wonder if I just got the first draft. I have not taken the exam yet, but I have purchased another certification book from Sybex. I hope that book will contain fewer errors than this book. I don't have enough confidcnce in this book to use it as my only study guide."
4,10g Certification,"If you are planning on taking the Oracle 10g upgrade exam this is the book I used to take the test, and I passed. A few questions on the test on nowhere to be found in the book and that could be because they are new questions or something along those lines. The practice exams are ok and may be a bit easier than the questions on the exam. I looked at some other publishers for Oracle exams and I say Sybex are the ones I am most comfortable with. I purchased this book and scheduled the exam for 6 weeks out. If I would have failed I would have blamed the book :)As a reference book you will need additional sources as this book focuses on the Oracle exam. Good luck with the exam."
4,OCP 10g review,Covers all examination subjects always to complete with the 10g Documentation Library; provides useful subjects organization focusing on the exam.
3,Magnet,"I love the quote on this magnet and ordered it to give to my daughter to offer words of encouragement. I love the simplicity of the white lettering on a black background. However, I was disappointed in the font size. It appeared to be much larger in the example I ordered from. I was extremely satisfied with the time it took to receive the magnet. I would order again from the seller."
2,Scholarship Without Compassion,"While scholarly and of interest, the text, sadly is not well organized so that one might apply and interpret the parts. The most striking problem with the text is the clinical manner in which the author describes the ""wanton"" nature of a girl, 20 years of age, who gave him her birth data for a chart but was raped and murdered before he gave the interpretations to her. He (Zoller) says she ""managed to get to a friends house after being beaten and raped but died on the way to the hospital"". He then goes on to ""illustrate"" how this was all due to her low character as he ""deomnstrates"" from her chart. This is an unspeakably lowly abuse of his poor client and the art of astrology and as such, I did not appreciate his approach one bit."
5,Preparing a Young Child for Standardized Tests,"Great presentation - pages are not busy and the font is the appropriate size.Great organization - begins by telling parents what to expect (i.e. children in K-2 are not usually required to fill out scantron forms and they must be good listeners to perform well on the tests). Also provides instruction and practice opportunities for developing your child's listening and guessing skills before diving into tests that are focused on the basic skills. In addition to the standard basic skills (language arts and mathematics), this book covers science, social studies, and computer/technology.This is a great book for preparing a young child for his first standardized test. It worked well for preparing my 5 year old son (1st grader). The content in this book works well for a first grader who attends a school that uses second grade textbooks."
2,disappointed,"when this mirror arrived I was looking into a mirror after a few weeks. We had recently moved and i had been really busy with unpacking and getting settled. I got a shock. It seemed i had widened considerably. I was depressed even though my husband assured me the mirror was wrong. It wasn't until i saw myself in some other mirrors that I believed my husband. Don't buy the mirror. Becoz of the stand the angle is strange. Im 5' 2"" and I find the length insufficient."
1,Shattered during shipping twice,I was very excited to find this mirror online however I had to order it twice because when I received the item all of the glass was shattered during shipping. I was extremely disappointed and frustrated with Target because they did not ship this mirror properly. Therefore I opted for a refund and I am still looking for the perfect mirror for my bedroom. Do not buy this product! Otherwise you will be opening broken glass and be wasting time trying to get your money back and disposing of a damaged product.
2,Great concept. Poor stiching and materials,"Bought this bag 2 & 1/2 years ago. The first time I packed it, one of the seams started to unravel. Contacted the seller, Bags & Baggage, after my trip and received no response. I have continued to use the bag. Several other seams are now unraveling, and the stiching has completely come out of one of the straps leaving it dangling. I have packed a bunch of stuff in this bag including swim fins, masks, and snorkles. The design is great. The shoulder straps are comfortable. The waist straps let the bag ride comfortably on my hips. If only the seams would hold up. If I cannot get a response from the seller, I'll have to trash it."
4,Good. don't bother with expandable,"took this around oceania for a month and it survived - fairly durable despite the lighter weight fabric. I had to make sure it was half-full to fit into the smaller asian airlines 18"" carryon standards (by always wearing the raincoat and holding the laptop as I boarded) - but once on the ground again I would stuff them in and put it on my back and pickup my rolling checked bag. (""light"" wasn't an option with a 3-yr old in tow, but we were able to hike ourselves onto public transport and have a hand left to hold hers). In hindsight I was never able to take advantage of the ""expandable"" option, so if I had to do it again I would go with his non-expandable bag if everything else is the same. pretty comfortable on back even loaded - although not a little small for my 6'2"" 210# body (and anything under 30 pounds doesn't feel that heavy no matter how poorly designed it is)"
4,"Great back, but it doesn't fit me well","Although this bag is well designed for the traveller and well contructed with tough zippers, etc., it did not fit my body. I'm 5'3 with a very small frame and after strapping this bag to my back for a few days, it was really starting to hurt my back. I had to pull the backpack straps as small as possible in order for the pack to fit correctly on my back. However, after doing this, the waist belt did not fit properly on my hips. This would have been the perfect bag, but it just doesn't fit my size. If you are petite, I would recommend another option. I'm planning on using my regular hiking backpack for my next trip, which is designed for women and fit's my frame. Otherwise, this is a superb product!"
4,Convenient Convertible Carry-on,"I needed a convenient carry-on piece of luggage (as we all do these days now that we are being gored by the airline industry) that was soft-sided, yet sylish, and east to carry. Rick Steves has come through again! He knows how to travel and pack lightly and it shows with this piece. Practically weightless, this piece will keep your items away from the gorillas that handle the baggage for the airlines and you'll deplane and be on you're way long before the first bag comes crashing down the chute in baggage claim. Pictured as if it has internal shape, which adds weight, this bag is like a day backpack complete with hideable shoulder straps if you desire to carry the piece as luggage. And when the expandable sides are opened, will still slide under the size limits of the overhead compartments! This is strictly a ""carry-on"" as there are no wheels attached. Bon Voyage!"
2,"Good idea, made on the cheap","I have had the same issues with this bag as others, I am now looking at the osprey 46 or the lowe alpine tt 40 carry on. I do not want to be stranded on my vacation with a bunch of broken bags.I have had two of his backpacks where the zippers pulls just split in two and the bag becomes useless. One was already a replacement from them. The bag does work, it just has cheap zipper pulls on them that break. I have also had 3 of the zipper pull tabs just disappear while on my trips.Done with his products."
4,Not quie an MLC but a good bag for half the price,"I was looking for a replacement for my old Patagonia MLC. The zippers are not quite as substantial (Zipper teeth are about 1/2 the size on this bag. Not sure if the current MLC zippers are as big) and the shoulder straps have less padding. The handles have a lot of padding and are nice to hold. There is mesh on the side that contacts your back - comfortable and less sweaty.The lower front pocket holds my 12"" Power Book in a sleeve with a slight bit of room left. Other than the upper pocket, there are two more full-length pockets behind that. One opens at the top and one at the side. Carrying the bag vertically, things tend to slide toward the bottom and can be hard to access since the pockets overlap each other. The internal (main compartment) and external compression straps help to keep things in place."
4,"""Sure Holds A Lot""",I would recommend this to anyone who wants a Carry On that holds a lot. It was good that it was convertible as you could carry it as a backpack because it does not have wheels so it could be pretty heavy to just carry because it holds so much. I was amazed how much it coud hold and there were so many pockets or areas to put things in. Probably more appropriate for a male than a femaile.
3,"Buy updated version - ""Final Rights: Reclaiming the American Way of Death""","Book is good for what it is; states it very well. However, I was disappointed to find that this is not a different book from ""Final Rights"" which is really an updated version of ""Caring for the Dead"". So forget about buying this one and just purchase:""Final Rights: Reclaiming the American Way of Death"".Ms. Carlson does a good job of informing us about the American way of dealing with death ... I will definitely make different choices now thanks to these 2 books."
5,Perfect all in one!,"Taunton's has a long history of publishing extremely thorough woodworking books, and this is no exception. For an all-in-one book, this covers a great deal under one cover! Will remain on my workbench for a long time!"
2,Useless Commentary,The information on Bond in this book is second to none. The only problem is the social and political commentary littered throughout the book. The authors are obviously trying to push their world view through a book about James Bond. In the end it appears the authors would rather have Bond working for the Soviets than for the good guys.
5,For Extreme Bond Fans....,"This is a great coffee table book, and has everything you want to know about the James Bond life style and arsenal. Recommended for any true fan."
5,Hooray!!!!!,"Finally! Been looking for this movie forever! My cusins & I used to watch this all the time @ grandmas!We always used to call this film ""Marylou"" lol. Guess she was our favorite! Still till this day when they ask to borrow this film for their kids, its refered to as "" Marylou"". Sometimes I let them borrow it, sometimes not. Haha. Neverless, this is a great 70's feel cartoon, great music, fun story. I want the soundtrack!!!"
3,Pretty good little book,"I like this book a lot more than most of the other reviewers did. It was fun. The dialogue is good. The plot is a bit thin, though. Also, it's a bit short for the price. Try reading ""Deep Water"" first. It's a Buffy book by the same authors. If you like it, read this one too."
2,Seems they put in the characters and dialog before the story,"This book wasn't all that bad, but it did seem kind of pointless. It seems like they knew what characters, dialog and jokes they wanted in the story before they even had a story. Some of the jokes seemed to be recycled from jokes from the show, and some of the characters didn't seem to be necessary to the story (i.e. Ethan, Student Teachers). The fact that the demon killed people by dancing them to death seemed really stupid. When I think of evil, I think of the devil not the Pied Piper."
2,below average,"This book is quite below average for a Buffy book, but not terrible. The problem is that the plot really doesn't go anywhere and it is a bit boring. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen and it never did. I wouldn't really recommend reading it."
2,Not as I expected...,I give it 2 stars becasue once the charecters where portrayed as well as they are on the small screne. The problem was the story line wasn't strong as I would like it to be and it was quite borning in my opinion. Thank gooddness it was short. I don't reccomend reading this book unless you are a Buffy Obsessive.
3,A mediocre read,"These writers are the only ones I've read that can come a distant second to Holder & Golden regarding accurately representing the characters. There were several places where minor players like the student teachers, the watcher's council guy and Ethan Rayne were brought into the story but contributed nothing to the plot. Using Ethan to simply lurk around town was a waste of a perfectly good villain. This story is good as an appetizer while waiting for the next Holder or Golden release."
2,disappointing...,"Well, I am a BIG buffy fan, and i try to read every buffy book i can find, which is not the easiest thing since i live in japan, which also means that i can't watch the TV series. I think that the authors tried a little too hard in this book. I mean, i think they really knew their stuff, but everything in this book was so... not real. The plot and everything was good, and i think- as another reviewer mentioned- that it could've made a really great story if they had some more space to work on. From most of the buffy books i've read, i think that they all have some kind of message under the whole story. 'visitors' doesn't really have a point. I considered not reading this book after reading some of the reviews, but i bought it anyways, and u know what? It was a waste of money. Do not read it, even though it is short, it just drags on and on."
4,great characterization,"""Visitors"" , while not the scariest of the YA titles in the Buffy series, captures the characters as well, if not better, than the other YA Buffy novels. You'd expect to hear some of this dialogue in a script written by one of the shows regular authors."
4,A not very convincing plot...,"Well,the story line is a bit out of track and hard to digest.Not that this book is not good,but it just seems rather far off.It's amazing how the author linked the earth creature-korred,the student teachers and Giles old friend(or rather enemy)watcher."
2,more flat than an open bottle of month-old soda,"man, this stank! the plot was so thin, even a random living cell is thicker that it! what's up with that whole giggler thing anyway? could that BE any dumber? the only saving grace is that the characterisation is one of the better one's, although not as good as christopher golden and nancy holder. if they had a better plot with more details and twists, and less oh-i-know-what's-gonna-happen-next, maybe it would have been better."
2,"I didn't like it, plain and simple.","well, i've read just about all the Buffy books, and I found this one sorta disapointing. Try again! If you want to read a great book, try the gatekeeper trilogy."
2,"NOT THE BEST ""BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER"" BOOK I'VE READ.","I HAVE READ ALMOST ALL OF THE ""BUFFY"" BOOKS AND I MUST SAY THAT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. IT IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH ""HALLOWEEN RAIN"". AS FAR AS THE CHARACTERS WERE DISPLAYED VERY WELL, BUT THE PLOT WAS FARSTRECTHED AND UNIMAGINABLE."
3,Buffy the Vamp. Slayer: Visitors. Good book.,"I have just finished reading the book ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer:Visitors"". I found it good but it could have been ever so slightly better. I thought this because it showed from different points of views but on some did not show enough insight. The summary is: Buffy is being stalked by a mytholigical creature who dances it`s victims to death. And it has it`s eyes on Buffy. While this is happening a member of the council comes in for a visit and a group of student teachers visits Buffy`s school."
2,The book isn't good,"I have read almost all of the Buffy books, and i love them, but i thought that this book was very boring and slow. It portrays the charcters very well, but the plot is dumb."
2,"Good characters, bad story","""Visitors"" really had good potential. The characters were so true to form, I thought the author did her homework well! She had a wonderful idea for the next obstacle Buffy had to face, but it just fell flat at the end. This is one of those books that maybe could've been better if the author had more room to write. I really did love the portrayl of each character. She had the slang without over doing it, and sometimes I just enjoyed the conversations among the Scooby Gang that really had nothing to do with the story itself. Plus, she didn't overdo the Angel/Buffy relationship, either."
1,A flimsy piece of junk!,This machine is a total waste of money unless you just want to shred leaves. It won't take anything much larger. I have had numerous carburator problems and it is very difficult to work on. I recommend looking elsewhere
3,Mixed Bag,"I purchased this brand of chipper 6 years ago or so. I chewed up a mound of limbs 10 times a year or so. It was a work horse for the first few years, but it's falling apart, and I need to get a new one. Last year, I replaced a plastic hopper that cracked in half. This year, the internal metal components were shredded, and its beyond repair.Is this normal for a chipper? I don't know, but will take my chances on a new brand this year.My other beef with this chipper was that it gets plugged up pretty easily, and its a real SOB trying to unplug it. (Imagine your self laying in a pile of shredded leaves with a hammer and screwdriver drying to knock a branch loose.)On the bright side, the price is real attractive. But, you get what you pay for."
4,A Good Read!,"This book aims to show CEOs how to achieve the impossible. Based on a study of 70 companies that managed to accomplish incredibly ambitious goals, it offers a straightforward and, for the most part, lucid set of guiding principles to reach breakthrough success. Author Bill Davidson anchors his prescription in the experiences of real companies and illustrates each point with copious anecdotes. Although he strays now and then into the jargon of the academic tribe, these digressions are rare and excusable. His case histories and tactical advice offer something of value to every CEO or senior manager. We recommend this book to executives whose companies are trapped in strategic dead-ends and desperate to blast out, or to executives who would rather act before a crisis really blossoms."
3,Ho-hum stuff,"I disagree with the reader below who says it's the next Good to Great, one of the all-time best business books (my copy is totally dog eared, and I loan it out all the time). I didn't find anything new in this book, and I worked at two of the companies the author ""studied"" in his research. I say there's no need for a new Good to Great (it's timeless, in my opinion) and certainly no need for an also-ran like this one."
4,SO FAR SO GOOD,"the item arrived in a fair amount of time and placing the order was simple and easy, so far the product gives my hair a great feel"
4,Great Shampoo,Really like this product. I have seen Emu oil in a lot of products and I have had great experience thus far.
