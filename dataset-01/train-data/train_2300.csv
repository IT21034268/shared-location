5,Great Desk Phone,I had a difficult time finding a desk phone with speaker phone capabliity and not using batteries. This phone is a must for a home office or heavy phone user. The sound quality is great. There was a odd way of hooking up the wires to the phone line. It doesn't make sense but when you are done it works great.
4,32 1/2 Years,"Yes, that's how long I've waited to see this program. I was a teenager with a community orchestra rehearsal the night it aired. Oh, how I cursed that situation.It's a delight to see Lucy & Viv working together one last time. Their chemistry lifts this program up each time they share the screen. Ed McMahon's an odd choice to play Lucy's husband and it's just peculiar seeing Gale Gordon playing her father-in-law.However, classic Lucy moments are echoed in the script and it is an enjoyable watch. I'm glad to finally see it, happy to own it, and will watch it again.Now, how about getting ""Life with Lucy"" released?"
3,A must have for Lucy fans,"I saw this special when it was originally broadcast,and I remembered it as not being that good. My memory was correct,the comedy seems forced and actually not that funny, HOWEVER, you do get to see Lucy and Vivian work together for the last time,as well as many Lucy regulars,Mary Wickes is a stand out as always.Gale Gordon,Mary Jane Croft, I believe this was her last tv appearance as well as Vivians, Steve Allen,Ed Mcmahon(????) bad casting to say the least.The disc does boast some great extras ,well worth the purchase price, you get to see a lot of behind the scenes footage and a great interview with actor James E Bradhead. This is a must have for Lucy fans, I would suggest others to avoid it."
4,Enjoyable,"I feel Lucy here was a more mature, toned down women and that the show goes for some great physical laughs(The couch, Lucy talking after she breaks her teeth, the cake fight, Lucy putting on the microphone) and all throw lots of wisecracks to make this more than other Here's Lucy or Lucy shows an ensemble cast show. This is the last time Lucy played her Lucy charcter so funny. (I have only seen three Life With Lucys and the first eposide was funny and the Goose show had its moments but Lucy's Green Thumb was horrible and not funny at all.) I think anyone should get this show especially those that feel the Lucy character is not realistic and stupid because here Lucy is a normal housewife just having common misfortunes."
5,We still love lucy,"It's nice to see some of Lucille Ball's TV Specials being released on DVD. I had forgotten this TV special and it was a joy to watch. If you Love Lucy, then don't wait to buy this DVD. Have fun!"
3,"For Lucy fans, but sad","I remember seeing this special when it was first broadcast. As a Lucy fan, it was interesting to see the old Lucy performers of the past. I can not say it is hilariously funny but it brings some chuckles. However, there is an air of sadness as I saw it again on this DVD, which is of great quality. As I have learned from reading various biographys of the cast of I Love Lucy, Vivian Vance, who makes her last appearance on this special, was in very poor health when she performed on this show. She had recently had a stroke and was battling cancer which two years later claimed her life. But she performed like a trouper and her appearance alone and her rapport with Lucy is what I would recommend for Lucy fans."
4,It is fun to spend one last time with the cast of the lucy show,"This is it truly the last hurrah for the Lucy show. It is the last time we will ever see Lucy, Vivian Vance, Gale Gordon and Mary Jane Croft together. Kind of a bittersweet reunion. It works in spots and bit awkward in others. But if you are true Lucy Fan you will want to have this one in your collection. I definitely would not start here but it is a nice place to end your collection. It is amazing that Lucille Ball is getting the full treatment and all of her shows and specials are being restored and released on DVD. Finally everything Lucille Ball did is available in beautiful restored condition. A+ for getting this lost classic out on DVD."
2,Disappointed,As a great fan of I Love Lucy series I was very disappointed in this video. The plot was trite and Lucy as an older woman was not nearly as funny as she was in the original series. I am not going to keep this video in my library.
1,Waste of time and money,"While the book may have been marginally useful when it first came out, it has since been eclipsed by a wide selection of far superior materials advocating a return to a diet of our ancestors. Furthermore, the book is full of wrong information. For example, it heralds carbohydrates as having more satiety than fats (just think about your ability to eat a plate of pasta versus your ability to eat a plate of fat). The book advocates many foods that have nothing to do with our ""origins,"" with a heavy emphasis on post-agricultural foods (grains, legumes, etc.). One of the recommended snacks is brown rice with honey (why not a plate of pasta covered in corn syrup?). First chapter wastes nearly 30 pages with layman's retelling of evolutionary theory. Last 1/5 of the book consists of non-unique recipes and sourcing. Lots of trees died in producing this drivel. Don't waste your money."
2,Tuareg,"One of Mark Harmon's very very early movies and one i'm sure he would like to forget. It can almost not be rated as worth seeing. It gets a star because the VHS tape (at the time not available on DVD) was in excellent condition and i received it promptly.It is long and outdrawn - with not much of a story line, bad plot, bad actors and even worse acting.I watched it once and probably will never again ( unlike my other movies i watch again and again)"
1,regular buyer,I am a regular buyer at amazon.com and I always get the best prices here. But this product is offered on the vendor's website carromgear.com for $35 and $5 shipping + tax. Amazon.com price is at $50 + $22 shipping. I would buy it at amazon.com if the price difference was not so big.
4,Tripp Lite Outlet Strip,An awesome product except that I was under the impression that it was able to be mounted to any type of desk. It can really only be mounted to something that you can screw the mounts into. There is no way to simply clip it on to the edge of something.
5,Great product,"1 - Solid, well made, well designed. High plug capacity, decent plug spacing.2 - Other reviews are correct that a large/long transformer brick can sometimes obstruct a second plug because the sockets run parallel to the strip, but being parallel helps keep the profile thin making strip easier to run alongside a wall or tightly behind a desk.3 - No integrated surge suppression. I bought a 1-plug travel surge protector to connect the strip to."
5,Love this powerstrip,"Unlike many power strips that I've had around my computer, this one can actually use all of it's plugs because they are spaced out far enough to fit in the awkward sized ends. It does take up considerable space, but if you've got room under your desk, I highly recommend it as cords tend to be less tangled and easier to manage."
3,Switch cover as cheap as they get.,"The unit arrived early and the package looked OK. Once opend the switch plate cover which is made from thin brittle plastic was broken off. I don't think I will need the cover and it would probably just be in the way but if your going to include it, please make it of the same quality as the rest of the product. Pretty cheezy for a Tripp Lite product."
5,Perfect for an electronics workbench,"Quality product from Tripp Lite (as expected). Mounted horizontally on work bench, and 15' cord allowed for remote placement from wall outlet (primary reason for purchasing this model, I needed 12' min), Not a fan of the covered on/off switch, but given it's intended use is for a rack mount in a server/It closet, I see it's use there. Will likely pop that off since it makes daily power-downs a pain."
4,Great product,This is a great power strip I mounted on my workbench. I love having the 12 outlets so I can keep things like a radio and batter charger plugged in all the time. It was easy to mount. The one thing I don't like about this is that the power cord for the strip comes out of the face of unit. It should come out the end instead.
4,Solid,This is a well built product made out of metal. I comes with mounting brackets. The cord is thick and durable. I recommend it!
5,Great,Works just as described. Heavy duty for use in the Garage. No problems so far. Best feature is long lead on power cord.
3,Multi-outlet strip,"The major drawback to this item is that the outlets are mounted 90 from where they should be. As almost all wall warts plug in with the cord between the blades of the plug, that means when plugged into this strip the cords are in-line with the strip instead of at right angles to it as they should be. For this reason, even though the outlets are wide apart the cord still blocks the next outlet in line so I can only use half of them."
5,Good so far...,"I'm impressed with the quality of this powerstrip. Installation was a snap and it was easy to mount to the underside of my workbench. So far, I've experienced no problems, all outlets have power, and I expect the unit will continue to perform problem-free."
1,Swing-Away Can Opener NOW made in China,"I bought a Swing away can opener less than a year ago because my old one which was probably 15 years old was finally losing its sharpness.Boy am I dissapointed. First, the new ones are made in China. The old one proudly said MADE IN THE USA.Second, the unit has rusted and I have a hard time opening cans with it since it's so hard to turn.This is disgusting. I would pay a few more dollars and get a good product, not a peice of junk."
1,Almost as useful as a rock for opening cans.,"It takes three hands to open a can with a Swing-Away can opener. One hand to hold the grip, a second hand to turn the crank, and a third hand to hold the can. This is because the cutting wheel will walk over the rim of the can allowing the can to drop away from the can opener. This might be annoying if you are opening a can of something you can pour out of the can easily, but if you are opening something like chilled cranberry sauce or refried beans, which requires removing both ends of the can and allowing the contents to slide out in a cylindrical shape, this can opener is going to dump the can into the bowl, pot, or whatever food dish you are working over. In a restaurant, that means you dispose of the contaminated pot full of food and start over. So, unless you have three hands, or desire a can opener that requires two people to use, then this particular piece of equipment is not for you."
2,"Here's the scoop on ""Made in China""","Here's the scoop on the ""made in China"" discussion regarding Swing-a-way can openers. I called the AMCO Company last week and was told that since approximately 2008-2009 all their Swing-a-way can openers are made in China. Seems the original company may have changed hands a couple of times through the years, so those brands we could rely on, and were American made are no longer around. After spending quite a bit of time on the Internet searching, it appears that none of the other home can openers are made in the USA either. I called OXO and one other company as well, and the story was the same, all made in China. I just finished rummaging around in storage (ie., ""should have thrown it away"" stash)and found my two old Swing-a-ways and will try to clean them up and see if they will continue on for a few more years."
1,Sorely disappointed,"I really would love to be constructive about the product, but really the only metric it has to pass is ""can it open a can?"" Unfortunately, it slips off the can after one small turn every single time. It took 10 very frustrating minutes just to get a can of tuna partially open enough to dig out the contents with a spoon. I had an OXO Good Grips can opener before this and it worked flawlessly. I would recommend you stay far away from this one and go with one of the OXO can openers."
2,Grip contains phalates (gender-bending plastic softener),"We used to have an original swing-a-way which was fantastic. Somehow we lost it and have tried only one other off-brand can-opener. We got this one for Christmas 2012 and the package states: ""Warning: This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."" I looked up the product online and found that the handle contains phalates (gender-bending chemicals). I wonder how many other products have these phalates. Alternatives to phalates need to be found/used. Phalates are bad for humans and our whole ecosystem. I stripped the handles off and used hot glue sticks for the handles."
3,good purchase.,"Purchased this product to replace 3 failed can openers. (All China made)Specifically selected this because the one I have is just like this model and made in the USA . THIS ONE IS NOT. It is made in China.During my searches for a replacement I was amazed at all the China openers. It appears to me that (Swing-a-way) can openers have also moved out of our country for manufacturing.Still, this one works fine for now, have used it 60 or 70 times already but never again.Try to buy American Made. That puts America ot work."
1,"Swing-a-way manufactured in China, not the U.S.A!","Recently purchased one of these Swing-a-way portable can openers after being led to believe that it was the last American made can opener and being of superior quality.Upon receipt of the can opener, I quickly learned from it's packaging material that it is manufactured in China!"
3,"Worked When It Stayed On ""Track""","As my title implies, this can opener kept going off, for lack of a better word, ""track."" I couldn't make it entirely around a can without it ""riding up"" and, essentially, falling off the can. I used it on several DIFFERENT cans thinking maybe it was one company's particular construction that was causing the problem, but it happened with EVERY can I tried to open.I was really surprised (and disappointed) because this got such great reviews. Maybe I just got a bad one? It DID work when it stayed ON the can. . ."
5,Can Opener greatness !!,This is a great little product ! I had been searching for a replacement in stores for some time but was unable to find one. I ordered two Swing Away can openers with Ergonomic handles and love it !! The oldest design things are always the best things !
1,Not what you grew up with,"I agree with with the other reviewer who rated this can opener as one star. I bought mine from a well-known kitchen-store at the mall who stated it had a lifetime warranty on it. Of course I didn't keep the receipt - it was, after all, the end-all, be-all can opener.It worked for a few months, but now is as much of a dud as any and every manual can opener you could buy at Wal Mart (and I should know).I am going to attempt to buy a few quality P-38 can openers just to have -something- that can open a can when I really want to cook something, and may buy some other manual twist can opener eventually."
3,Good for a year,"Original review is below. I'm not sure how long most can openers are supposed to last but I threw this one out after about a year. Simply put, it got dull and wouldn't open cans properly anymore; it would leave gaps on the lid that were still connected to the can so that the can was connected at two or more points and wouldn't open.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Not much to say, this is the first time I've ever owned a Swing-A-Way myself, but I do remember that my mom had one for my entire childhood. As for my experience with this one, it's great, it's the easiest (the handle turns without much effort) to use can open I've ever owned and I can't believe I waited this long (almost 10 years) to get one. All metals will eventually get dull but I'm hoping that this one lasts a little longer because of the gear design."
2,Rust bucket garbage...,"The frame is bright chrome that lasts, as does the grip, but the crucial non stainless cutting/drive components rust away quickly. Not only does this effect operational quality, but everything you open TASTES LIKE RUST! Even when new it did skip, and emails to the company about their self-touted ""5 year warranty"" were ignored... Enough of these garbage can openers, and a new all stainless steel WMF opener is on the way.Hey Swing-Away; looks like another lost customer who used your products for years, and tried to support Made in USA products... Here's a hint; improve your product, and especially important, don't blow them off when they contact you!"
3,MC 5 - 'Human Being Lawnmower: The Baddest & Maddest Of The MC 5' (Total Energy),"Fourteen track compilation pretty much for the completists only. Not a bad collection,it's just that many long-time MC5 fans will likely already have most,if not all these cuts. Several that I liked best were the heavy rocker ""Looking At You"", ""Rama La Fa Fa Fa"", the studio out-take for ""American Ruse"" and the 19-minute epic, drawn out ""I'm Mad Like Eldridge Cleaver"". Semi-recommended. However, I would first listen to sound clips off this disc where ever you could find some, then make your decision from there."
3,Adult adoptee opinion,"I am a 35 yr old adoptee and ordered this book for helpful insight into the adoptee/birthmother interactions.I was caught by surprise when Katie revealed right away that she is a lesbian.Unfortunately, this soured the book for me.I wish this information would have been written in the editorial review!"
3,Arrogant but likeable,"He's a little too high on himself, but the cockiness is backed up with consistently solid performance, so who's to judge?"
5,Mike's story is great!,"This is a great read for fisherman and those that want to know more about what it might be like to pursue a career in professional bass fishing.Having met Mike at a show, I can tell you that he's a real human and this story comes off with his great enthusiasm.Give it a read. you'll like it!"
3,fising on the edge,this book was not what I had expected. I was looking for fishing in general and this book focus was on bass fishing. Needed better descriptor
1,Something Smells Fishy,"Mike Iaconelli has written a book about his rise to prominence in the world of professional Bass fishing. He almost quit at the time he achieves the pinnacle of the sport in winning the Bass Masters Classic. This book chronicles his struggle to that end. This could have easily been told in a small monograph or pamphlet. The fact that it is a hard cover book tells a lot about the mind set of Ike(as he is known).Please don't waste your time with this as I did. He trashes a lot of the sports organizers and fellow fishermen. I think, more so, just to get ""sound bites"" for publicity.If you want to read about this sport, get the books of Kevin Van Dam, Ray Scott, or even the entertaining book about tournament fishing written by Carl Hiassen."
3,MiIldly helpful,"The book was fine. The practice tests were nice so I guess it was worth it for that but the study tips weren't much more than ""studying is a good idea"". Later I learned that pretty much everything in the book is online at the west-E/B website..."
2,Proceed with caution,"I found many, many errors in the practice test section of this book. It is difficult to get a true idea of how you will do on the actual test."
3,West B prep,"This was my 2nd favorite study guide for preping for West B exam. The style in which it was written and organized was not easy for my ""scientifice"" brain to ""digest""---which actually turned out to help me prepare for the actual test! I found that about 85% of the ""Reading subtest"" was easier or equal to the practice questions in this guide. I found the ""Writing"" tips and stradgies were helpful. Worth the money to me! Not sure I would have done so well on the exam without it."
1,Do THEY even know what's on the test?,"This book contains a lot of typos and material that isn't even covered on the real test. The math and multiple-choice writing sections are the worst: the math section has some concepts that are actually too advanced to be on a basic skills test, so you end up wasting your time re-learning things you don't even need, and the writing section seems to ask the same generic question over and over again. I wouldn't buy it."
3,Nice framework but with Several Errors,"This study guide gives a pretty good framework of what the test will look like and of the types of questions that are asked. However, there are several errors (especially in the practice test section)so be aware. I suggest just finding a middle-school textbook to study from if you need good practice (especially in the math section)."
2,Decent review of test format and subjects - Practice tests/answers are iffy,"The first half of this book is pretty good. It provides a concise, focused review of format and subject matter for the three WEST-B sub exams. But the practice sub exams are really why I wanted this prep book rather than the others available on the market. Unfortunately, several of the practice test questions are poorly constructed, and there are a few questions that make no sense at all. The answer key is also not great... while ""detailed"" answers are provided, the rationale for some of the ""correct"" answers seemed faulty. And for a few questions, the answer provided in the key is clearly wrong and the rationale erroneously refers to content/questions from a previous version of the book. I haven't looked at the other available prep books, but I would certainly recommend checking them out before buying this one."
1,torn gift wrap,"When I got my package, the corner of the gift was torn already. I feel like 5 dollars more for gift wrap is not worthy at all."
4,perfect,"I really like this seat cover. It was easy to put on, it's durable, and looks nice inside! Even better it doesn't make the seats hot in the sun."
5,One of the better 2012 DVD's,This is not doom and gloom. More based on objective facts. Pretty good. The history channel usually has good material.
2,Certainly not the 3D for Standard 3D TVs,"I didn't particularly like it, and might have liked it better if it were truly in3D. It's not the 3D for standard 3D televisions. It was a waste of time ordering it"
2,very poor 3D visuals...didn't get the movie at all...,Bought for grandkids and it didn't seem to be a very well made movie...poor 3D effects...
1,IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE IN 3-D,I TRAYED BY MENY 3-D GLASSES BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO WCHE THIS MOVIE IN 3-D DONT BUY.
1,Like a game,First it is more like a video game. My grandson did not even seemed interested. 3d did not work. I do not recommend.
2,Disappointed :(,I was looking for 3D movies to try out on my Nvidia PC upgraded with 3D Vision. This movie was not vary good to me kinda fuzzy and the story line was a snoozer. Alien Adventure was much better!
1,WOULD NOT buy from Amazon again!,typed in 3d blurAY AND THIS CAME UP. sO I BOUGHT IT AND UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS dvd NOT BLURAY AND MY 3D TV AN GLASSES ARE NOT COMPTIBLE.WASTE OF $40 BECAUSE OF A STUPID SEARCH ENGINE
1,Haunted Castle (3-D),This movie looks like it was created on a home computer. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a current production release for your new flat screen 3D TV.
1,Total Waste of Money,Misrepresented as a 3D movie. It does not work on my Panasonic 3D TV at all. Should not be listed as a 3D movie or sold as such.
1,Doesn't work with 3D t.v.'s,I saw this movie in the IMAX theater and loved it. This movie does not work with 3D t.v.'s You need a special player and glasses to view it in 3D.
1,Don't buy this CD,"I recently purchased this CD, and it will not play in 3D in any of the formats offered on my 3D TV."
1,Didn't work,I have a 46 in Sony Bravia and this 3-D movie didn't work. I have 2 other 3-D movies and they work fine.
3,Haunted Castle 3D,"Well commended for he art work. I expected pop ups, but did no find any.Perhaps the summary should be reworded to reflect the true nature of the movie."
2,movie Fine 3D Ain't,"I bought this movie to watch it in 3d on a front projection system with a 6 foot wide screem . I bought the recommended 3d equipment to see it, and while it almost works it was disappointing. They need to get the bugs out. You can watch this movie in 2D and its entertaining but it would really be impressive in the 3d mode it was intended for. I am sending the equipment back and the three other movies that came with it..If this equipment is improved I'd like to try it again."
2,Not Impressed with 3D quality,"Couldn't really enjoy the story, spent too much time trying to adjust my TV and switching from one pair of 3-D glasses to another. Just wasn't a quality experience for me. But, truth be told, I haven't been ""like WOW"" over any 3D film made for TV viewing. The process is not on par with my expectations....not yet, anyway."
3,Purposefully Difficult.,"There's no real structure to this film, the video quality is poor in almost all of the scenes, the audio quality is sub par, there are precious few songs that they show to the end, and there are no DVD ""chapters"" so you have to watch the whole thing through in one sitting. Which is all, seemingly, intentional. I get the low-rent aesthetic, it made the stereo/mono records kind of charming, but also frustrating (much like Paul's career). So, in that, in about 80 minutes or so, he managed to sum up his career as being a frustrating (frustrated) artist with flashes of brilliance, I've got to give it 3 stars. Had there been, oh, one or two more songs that were played out to their conclusion, I would've rated it higher."
3,For Diehard Fans Only - Others Stay Away,"An interesting disc, and as a Mats/Westerberg fanatic, I felt like a kid on Christmas morning when I popped this disc in the player. This will not turn on new fans to PW, but for those of us who are tried and true fans and have not seen this side of the man, its essential."
3,cheap,The strip is thin and bent the first time I used it. Would not buy again. Probably would make my own next time.
2,did not hold up.,"I guess it is what it is. I live in the northeast. we had a mild winter, this wear bare is trashed after one season.I previously made one from steel at a hardware store which laster longer for a little less money , but more labor intensive. You decide if you got the skills and tools just by some steel."
2,"If you don't know Exchange Server, this one's not for you","I purchased this book as a sys admin working with Exchange Server for the first time, and this book took an already complex product and made it more frustrating. I was looking for a book that would explain the capabilities of Exchange Server and how to configure it to exploit these capabilities. This book seems much more concerned with migration of existing enterprise messaging systems to Exchange and upgrading existing Exchange installations than actually setting up Exchange from scratch.While I am sure that there is good info in this book that I will eventually use, I would definitely not recommend this book to someone who didn't know quite a bit about Exchange Server to begin with."
5,Music to be an outlaw to..,"So the one star review was for Amazon NOT SENDING THE ITEM... Not because the music. THE MUSIC IS SICK!Talk to any Shiner, this is the ablum that cracked the outlaw/aggie market for the Moonshine Bandits. I've been to the shows and there is more to it than some songs. Your going to be in with the underground whiskey crowd, the aggie party crowd, and the crowd that parties where the sheriff wont go.This album is tight and these are my favorite songs.-Sweet Home California (mix this in when you need the party to whoop it up)-Hometown (A must have for any west coast, ag outlaw, barstool bandit, or Shiner-Moonshine (hahah, this is my drinking alone song..)-Country Livin' (must have for any aggie, outlaw , or hickabilly, hickhopper)There is something here that I can't quite explain to you. It's a sense of family when you meet another Shiner. You'll have to see it for yourself. Don't just stop at the song."
5,Hunt this one down - it's worth the trouble to find it!,"Excellent medieval fiction, wonderful storyline. For those of you who want stories written about how women would have really behaved during these times - well, this isn't your story. But Ryan has a wonderful knack for taking characters from this time, making then adapt some ""modern"" characteristics - but in a way that melds them seamlessly into medieval society. I'd read two others by her - Sun and the Moon and Silken Threads (both wonderful) and tracked this one down. It was worth the effort. Corliss and Rainulf are spectacular, two individuals who need to be their own person but also need each other. The supporting characters create a fascinating story that will keep you up late at night, not wanting to put the story down. Ryan also does a fabulous job of building the passionate tension between Corliss and Rainulf and bringing them together in a memorable fashion."
5,"Fun, independent characters who belong together","This is SO worth reading. The characters are not your typical romance novel ones who see each other and are attracted to each other for no reason. In fact, they meet each other when the woman is dying of the pox. The priest helps her to dig her grave and nurses her while she has a high fever. THe woman is not the requisite virgin who keeps herself pure until she meets the man who will forever change her. Instead, she's a pluck, independent lass who simply wants to live her life as she believes she has the right to. This independence gets her in trouble, but not annoyingly so.This is a true love story between two characters who don't WANT to love each other, but who can't help it because they've grown to love each other.Definitely worth reading. While the characters do not hop into bed immediately, when they do, it's hot, hot, hot. :o)"
5,"Intelligent, touching love story","This was a great book. Well-written and historically well-researched, and the love story grew in a totally real and believable way. I started reading and could not put it down, then promptly got on and ordered three other books by this author. I was very impressed and cannot recommended this book highly enough."
5,terminate rap & gloom,"not that this az en'thin ta doo wid crap-I mean rap. This product does not require you to go to a record & clothing store & obtain a guru. If you like smart stuff; I mean if you speak the unspoken language of music & like themes of fun, this you would be happy to enjoy. I think Amazon may have this artist's other wowzer. stop reading this & go look, ya big techno dummy!"
3,Fine budget disc,"Ole Schmidt conducted this second disc of Sibelius for this series. It conatains the 5th and some other works by Sibelius to round out the picture.Since the CD series features famous works by well known composers, we will not expect more beyond the 2nd (McKerras) and this disc.One can get entire Sibelius cycles for about 20 dollars, many better than this, but it does serve its purpose.So it is not a bad disc, better than many Naxos efforts."
3,mainly for the paint,"I find the fact that the paint set includes a brush is pretty essential. Although, the space marines that come in the box are probably the worst you'll find out there. The whole set together is pretty good. The set contains 9 paints, one of them a metallic so you get a better deal than if you buy the paints and space marines seperately."
4,A beginners guide to painting,"When i first started to get into warhammer this was the first thing i got, it really helps you on showing u on how hard it's gonna be when u start to bigger things. The thing that this is good for is to test ur paint skills and see if u'd like to get more guys and actually start building army. But if u really h8 painting then u probably shouldn't get warhammer or warhammer 40kbut if u [stink] and u'd like to try i suggest u do. I have to be the worst painter but i spent time and now i paint amazing modelsI suggest u buy this if u want to start collecting but u will need citadel colour spray paint as a under coat so then u can get started."
5,"Great for any army,mainly Space Marines","If you like Space Marines buy this!(Or if you like any army buy this) It comes with 5 space marines for non-Space Marine armys to practice on, or for me, 5 Space Marines to use. It comes with 9 good,common paints and a great paintbrush. BUY!"
3,Seiko for women,"Very good looking watch at a a very good price!Good: price, good looking.Bad: not to much information about the materials used, not very precise indicators and set mechanism"
5,Seiko watch,"I had looked at this watch for 6 months. I had priced it locally at two different retail stores, each could not come close to the price I found here at Amazon.The quality and appearance is exactly the same, and I'm very pleased.The service and turn around time with Amazon was exceptional as well.I've placed orders before, and each time was extremely pleased with the product ordered and service received.Seiko Women's Coutura Watch #SUK008"
1,Not Impressed....,"This book is not what I was expecting. Most of the pages are already colored in and only a few items are left for your child to color on. My son is only 2 and obviously can not stay within the lines, so crayon goes all over the page.It is very difficult to wipe away the crayon from the areas that are already colored in and only the small pictures that are white and meant to be colored on are easy to wipe away. I had to throw it away after a few uses. I like the concept of this book and think its a great idea, but leaving the pages all white and easier to clean off would have been ideal."
5,works fine for a small lawn,"I had an older version of this sprinkler for several years until it broke when I dropped it onto concrete. I was a little hesitant to replace it with this model when I read another very negative review. Since buying it six months ago, however, I've had no problems at all.This sprinkler does a very good job of watering my small lawn. There are two plastic levers that allow you to adjust how far the cylinder oscillates. Every year or so, one of the sprinkler holes might become clogged. If you unscrew one end of the sprinkler, there's an attached length of rubber that easily cleans any clogs."
2,Didn't last,"This sprinkler worked fine, for about a month. The gear drive didn't last and, to their credit, the manufacture promptly replaced it. However, the next one didn't last much longer than the first. The oscillating drum kept hanging up. Plastic sprinklers just aren't a good idea, given the heavy use and rough handling they must endure. This one was no exception. I'll be looking for a metal one in a higher price range to save the aggravation."
1,Poor Hose Connection,I bought this sprinkler. I love the ability to finesse my watering needs with it but I have to admit that the hose attachment is way too shallow. My hose is forever coming loose. There must be other units on the market that are better than this.
2,"Not durable, left sticky residue","Within a few months of applying these stickers to my keyboard, the letters had completely worn off on the most frequently used keys. When I removed them (because they were no longer useful, what with the characters being worn off) they left a sticky residue on every key which I have thus far been unable to remove. Gross.I would advise going for more durable (probably more expensive) stickers if you're planning to use these for more than a month or two. Or if you mind sticky residue. They did look very nice for the brief period they were legible, though."
4,"Interpretation is wonderful, powerful, meaningful.","The performance of Hindemith's Funf Stucke is awesome. I have performed this piece many times, and I must say that the quality of playing is wonderful! The first and fourth movements are especially well done. The Barber Adagio is also very well done, and will beg you to be played again and again. The Britten and other pieces are performed with the same intensity as the Hindemith and Barber; I recommend this CD to any avid fan of string orchestra music."
4,4 stars,"I received this product but have not had the chance to use it. Its sand paper, how difficult is that? The only complaint I have is this company wont stop spamming my email with adds. I wish they would be appreciative that I purchased their product, and now leave me the (blank) alone. So maybe you'd be better off using some other company... Just a word of thought.Amazon should have some way of protecting their clients from receiving excessive adds from its sellers."
3,Fly into the danger zone,"Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies - Circa 2002GOOD:- A good mix or simulation style and arcade fun- Nice mission variety, good amount of air craft to unlockBAD:- Might play to much like arcade or to simulation for some- Story is a little blandIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- Takes place in a fictional world similar to our own with the same aircraft as our own- Game is broken up into missions (levels) in which you follow objectives and earn points to unlock new aircraft- Certain missions are much easier with certain aircraft, example slow ground based missions' call for the A-10 and fast air-to-air missions call for the Y-F22, but you can still use any jet fighter you want on any level (so you never feel pigeon holed)GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere- Lethal Skies- Ace Combat 5: The Unsung WarADDITIONAL NOTES:- All the fighter aircraft in this game are replica of real life fighter aircraft- This game also comes with a two player spilt screen versus mode"
3,A Good Warm-up for Ace Combat 5!,"The Graphics for the story-line is 'Poor'. The Arial Graphics are Good-to-Very Good. Since I have already played 'Ace Combat 5', I found this game 'Ace Combat 4', to be a GOOD study or Stepping-Stone for A.C.5. I liked this game, it's O.K. Namco is a great name in Air Battles, as far as I'm concerned!"
3,episode parts cut out,"Note to Matlock fans,The packaging has very fine print that says episodes may have parts edited out.This proved to be true with the episode ""The DJ"", which cut out a nice (and key) section of the show which was an exchange between the Don Knotts character and Ben Matlock.The original network airing had this key segment included.I won't be buying any more seasons until the price drops below $13.There's no telling what other parts have been cut in other episodes."
1,Not what I thought it was.,"When I bought this book, I thought it might help me with my new hobby ""quilting"". But it seemed that the content of the book did not relate to new ideas or techniques. The problem that I had with this book is the fact that it tried to take the important lessons of life and relate it to ""quilting"". I know many good self help books on getting over your own personal demons in general. But if you have personal obstacles such as insecurities and demons that prevent you from making a great quilt, then I think it would be best to take some quilting lessions or simply just take a break from quilting! All in all, this book did not help me."
4,Getting the Point across in 30.2 seconds,Who needs 15 minute epics? Certainly not this band. They get the main point out in like 10 seconds. They are the masters of grind core and just plain rock out. It's especially great when you are taking a short drive. They prove that quantity is sometimes better than quality (although that is pretty good as well here).This album consists of humourous songs you cant understand! yay! what could Be better?
5,absolute genius,"This album is the most mind blowing, profound work of artistic genius. I can't stop listening to it."
5,Can't foget about my buddies!,Oh yeah...While searching for amazing grind bands in amazon i found anb which made me smile alot. I have honky reduction & altered states of america which both blew me away but none of those albums sounds as incredible as fcswd even if they tried...Because fcswd seemed more organized & foces on unlike the other ones which isn't saying anb's previous releases were bad because it wasn't at all!Anb is nothing short of amazing and their albums shows exectly that!
3,Adequate thriller-mystery,"This book won't blow you away, but for the most part, it is comfortable reading. The mystery is done in thriller format, where a story unfolds and the clues are explained in the end; it isn't much of a mystery, but it is inventive enough not to be tedious. The main strength of this book is the lead character, a Father Koesler, who's a nice traditional priest with whom most can identify. I enjoyed reading it but would like more of a mysterious and compelling tale to read another from this author."
5,Great Products,A beautiful tree. Better than anything I was able to find at local nurseries. Customer service was great. Will be back this fall for more trees.
5,Best series of books that I've read in years!,"I'm not very good at expressing my opinions on paper so just let me say that I agree with all the five star ratings written about this series of books. These books are going on my permanent keep bookshelf. I've re-read them several times and enjoy them more each time I read them. The growing relationship between Will and Gaston is incredibly written. Each line of the book furthers the story, no fluff here.I am greatly looking forward to book four!"
5,Great Series ...,"I have to say I was pleasently surprised by this series. It sounded okay, the reviews were decent and I became totally addicted! I give credit to some of the reviewers who complained regarding Will's ""21st century views"" and Gaston's modern medical expertise, particularly in this first book. But the author at least attempted to explain these unique views (yes, maybe just a little on the weak side) but enough for me to get past it and just enjoy the great love story, wonderful characters, differing locales and the action. I do wonder why the last book is not on Kindle?? Recommended."
5,Fantastic,Wonderful series. I am absolutely in love with W. A. Hoffman's style and can't wait to finish to start over.
2,Why does this series have such high ratings?,"While I acknowledge there are those who find these kind of soap opera antics deeply engaging, I am baffled as to how they might think it merits a high score. Melodrama does not constitute emotional insight.Try these:Warchild -- Karin LowacheeHallucinating Foucault -- Patricia M. DunckerSwordspoint -- Ellen KushnerThe Left Hand of Darkness -- Ursula K. Le Guin"
3,The Cool Ruler,"I'm not sure about the track listings on the site, but my Cool Ruler CD has Native Women, John Public, Party In The Slum, Uncle Joe, Word of the Farmer, One More Time, Let's Dance, Don't Pity Me, Created by the Father and Raving Tonight. This is a CD packed with smooth grooves that Gregory wraps his oh so silky vocals around. John Public, One More Time, Let's Dance, Created By The Father and Raving Tonight are sure to grab ya."
1,Don't waste your money on this DVD,"I am very disappointed with this DVD. It is so bad I could only l look at it once. Curt Mitchell is not a good teacher. He goes through the riffs quickly without explaining anything. The camera is at a distance, you can barley see how he is playing the riffs. I thnk you would get the same amount of ""education"" by just viewing the ""real"" Eagles playing in a music video."
3,Nice modern Kenton,"The charts are good -- Hank Levy is at his very best here, especially with Decoupage, but the band is not up the levels of the past. The performance of the sax section is disappointing (intonation and blending is below par but the individual solos are fine) and the trumpet section sounds uninspired. The Kenton ensemble ""punches"" are weak compared to the past. The bar was set high by Kenton -- so this is still a nice set of charts, but I rate it near the bottom of the Kenton discs."
4,Nice colors,I really like the colors. I am also happy you get three cause they do not last real long.
1,What a Waste,"Given the title and the picture for it on the Amazon page, I thought this video was going to feature some kind of spring break antics. Instead, it consisted of someone carrying a camcorder walking back and forth along a street that bordered a beach. No kind of interaction . . . no action at all. Just a video of people sitting and walking along the sidewalk. Clearly, I missed the point of this because I considered it to be a monumental waste of my time."
1,Do not waist you Money!,Do not waist you Money! So dude walking around making the worst home movies I have ever seen in my life. Rent at your own risk. nothing is happening in this crap. I just wasted a $1.99. If I ever see anybody on the street I seen in this video I am walking up and straight asking for my money back! Wack ass videos producers..
1,Awful!!,I wouldnt even call this a movie. It shold be removed from your catalog. I wish it was possible to get a refund.
5,Does it's job,"The chargers works like it's supposed to,can't say anything bad about it. The only thing is that I ordered a white charger and I got a black one. I didn't send it back because it's just a charger and the color didn't make a different to me."
1,Charger not compatible w/ Zen Microphoto,"What I received were generic cell phone chargers (ac and car) that weren't compatible and didn't charge my Zen Microphoto at all. Both the ac and car adapter were black, not white like the product title, image shown, or other user reviews, so it seems like they have started shipping a different product than what I thought I ordered. Save your time and order the charger made by Creative, which is what I'll be doing."
5,A Great Book,"I think in order to pass judgement on this book you have to thoroughly read it and then try the food combining progam. That's what I did and I have had great results in only a few weeks. I'm so glad that a clelebrity is endorsing this method of eating. With the media constantly telling us 'no fat allowed' I think it's great that someone with Suzanne's exposure is endorsing something that is not only healthy, but actually works. If you're having trouble losing weight or maintaining you weight, I would highly recommend reading this book."
5,Best Weight Loss Plan on the Market,My friend lost 100# in 9 months on this plan; My daughter went from a size 22 to an 8 in 12 months. A coworker had her blood pressure medicine halved after being on this eating plan for 6 months. I have already lost 12# in 2 weeks. I love it. I know it works. The book was in excellent condition and the price was fabulous.
1,A big disappointment! Suzanne Somers products are top notch,"I expected her book to be top notch......I was very disappointed.....if you haven't read all her previous books you will not understand this one! I have no idea what Level One and Level Two are. A few less family photos and more receipes would of been a nice touch! Again, I am sorely disappointed in Suzanne, expected so much more."
1,...A bit fiddly in my opinion...,"Well, my wife and I tried this diet plan, and lost a little, BUT...CON: some of the ingredients and just a marketing ploy.CON: It makes no mention of what to do if you're lactose intolerant.CON: How do you thicken a sauce without cornstarch? Arrowroot? Pretty hard to locate in most grocery stores. File Gumbo? Makes a green gloppy mess out of your meal.CON: Somewhat poorly written, more poorly compiled into a book, and the person or persons in charge of the index need to be educated (back to school with you now!) in compiling a COMPREHENSIVE index. Facts and figures are just too hard to find in this book.PRO: SHe's probably rich from sales of this re-hash of Atkins, Sugar-busters, and Carb Addicts.PRO: She's easier on the eyes than Atkins was!"
2,"Close, but no cigar.","No. It goes toward the mark, then veers-off wildly. I, personally, found the Forward to be of more use. Food combining is eluded to, but in true Hollywood style, is so perverted (in the truest sense of the word), that it appears Susanne came up with the whole idea of food combining. Here's why I say what I do: My health history is horrible. I learned all I could, before I dieted, so I wouldn't cause more problems. Susanne outlines the proper plan, yes, but proceeds to turn it inside-out. BASIC AND PROPER FOOD COMBINING is required to build a FIRM FOUNDATION, from where a person can reestablish their Endocrine System (the recipes combine nothing that should be combined)! No wonder, we're all sick! People, I don't have a degree, but I'm able to see plain and simple sense."
1,"Eat, Cheat and Get Liposuction","I've read this book and there's not a shred of scientific truth in it. For many overweight women, in fact, the advice could be unhealthy, if not so misleading it becomes downright dangerous. If you admire Suzanne Somers as a celebrity, great. You can even put her poster on your wall. But don't get your MEDICAL INFORMATION and health advice from her, for godsakes! This woman has breast cancer!"
5,Wonderful philosophy and recipes,"Molten Chocolate Cakes. The best coated chicken dish I've ever eaten--we have it at least once a week in my house.Somers, a Palm Springs part-timer, has terrific insights on raising kids to like food other than bologna sandwiches and fruit roll-ups. We are all eating too much sugar and it's poisoning our society. We have convinced ourselves that diet food can't taste good. Wrong! Why are the French and Japanese so healthy? They are light-years ahead of us in eating habits. So is Somers."
4,Suzanne does a great job in this book,"This is a good read. I first bought the book on tape, and wanted more for reference, plus the recipes. Suzanne makes sense of Atkin's diet, you CAN have carbo's, it's a matter of which carbo's and how you combine them (sorry, no white flour or our beloved potatoes). Finally a low carb diet that lets you have a more typical breakfast, eating bacon and eggs on the run just doesn't cut it for me. I love Suzanne and this book is great, buy the tape too, she's a great speaker."
3,This book lacks vital information,"Somersizing works but the program lacks information regarding how to properly balance your carbohydrate and protein/fat intake on a weekly basis. I do applaud Suzanne Somers' efforts to educate those of us who have been submitted to the low-fat, high carb diet craze that has overtaken America.If you would like more complete information on food combining get 'Eat Yourself Slim' by Michel Montignac. He created the original program that Suzanne Somers and Dr. Schwarzbein uses."
3,"Good book, but skeptical about the diet itself....","I have read Suzanne Somer's book and in theory like what I hear, but following it, one has to eliminate basic traditional (healthy) items like a tuna sandwich. Hard to put into practice. I also don't understand Diana Schwarzbein's support of the book because even though she agrees with raised insulin being the cause of overweight, her program is more similar to the Zone....carbs, protein and fats at every meal...a totally different approach....so why does she endorse Suzanne Somer's book? That is odd to me. I enjoyed this book simply because I felt I ""got to know"" Suzanne Somers better. I have to admit I wondered if there was a protein/cancer link also. I hope not and I hope Suzanne wins her battle against cancer and follows whatever diet her doctor tells her to follow."
2,Great book but....,"The book is very well written, but the diet didn't work for me. I didln't really lose any weight on it. But I know others that did, Good luck to those who want to try."
3,Good recipes,"I've tried her diet plan years ago, but, as always with dissociated diets, I was constantly hungry and because of it I overate, she's right about fat but she's not at all about using fat free milk and yogurt (this two aspects in reality contradict each other) and fructose which increases tryglicerydes, but her recipes, using full fat products and sugar instead of fructose, or her sweetener, are delicious. I'm giving 3 stars just for them, for the real french diet I suggest the fat fallacy or other books about the so called french paradox, because in France they eat a slice of bread with their cheese.....Another problem I've with this book, like with the others after this, is that it's a big infomercial for her products, I've tried them once while following her weight loss plan and didn't like them (too pricey and full of ""garbage"")."
4,Interesting,"I took this book out of the library on a tuesday, read it and returned it on friday. I understand the concept and I think Ms. Sommers helps to clarify it even better. There is good fat/there is bad fat but sugar isn't good for us. Diabetes runs in my family and I am trying to cut if off before it begins with me. I think the only reason I haven't begun this program is because I have been so brainwashed by this society; (one I might add that is extremely overweight and promotes surgery for weightloss) to believe that I have to eat a certain way. I actually found some of the products she mentions in a whole food store. I have ordered her sommersweet from her website. I think I am going to committe to 7 days of eating in this matter. I have to loose weight but my objective at this moment is to get the sugar out of my diet as much as possible. I would like to feel less stuffed."
3,Yes and No,"O.K., I purchased the book and have read it. Yes, I'm going to try it NOT because it's Suzanne Somers, but because--after doing a lot of searching and trying of other ""lifestyle changes""--the information makes some sense. HOWEVER, I am NOT a big Suzanne Somers fan. I really could have used more information and recipes. (If Alan Hamel makes such great smoothies, then how come there were not any recipes for smoothies?) I did not need the Suzanne Somers/Alan Hamel family photographs littered throughout the book. I did not need to read about the lavish Southern California lifestyle she chooses to live. I don't know if I would purchase the other two books. I'm still sifting out the valid information from the marketing of the celebrity ego."
1,Same book - different title,This book was very dissapointing - I thought I got a new book - It's just the same as book 1 and 2 - I think it is an interesting program - and I hope to do well on it - but I waited for 6 weeks for the new book to start - and really feel like I got taken.
1,Too much Somersize marketing-early books are better,"Suzanne Somers' diet is a good idea and it works. However, based on her earlier successes, Ms. Somers' has started marketing a series of products to help follow her diet. This book is filled with recipes that all require her new products. Buy her old book where she still focused on using what is in your kitchen. These recipes are merely marketing for her products."
3,"More Info, but same recipes","Suzanne's new book contains more info on the benefits of this way of eating but it duplicates many recipes that appeared in her previous books. That being said, this book does have more desserts than the other two books. All in all this is a pretty good book, it doesn't seem as braggy as the other books about the wonderful family, many trips, etc. A minor complaint, there are several advertisements for her new sweetner and her website which hawks all her misc. stuff."
1,Why DID I buy a nutrition book from a 'celebrity'?,"I bought this book after scanning the forward written by Dr. Diana Schwarzbein. When I re-read the forward after plunking down full price, I saw that Dr. Schwarzbein does not ascribe to Suzanne Somers' food combining. I sold Somers' book and bought ""The Schwarzbein Principle : The Truth About Losing Weight, Being Healthy, and Feeling Younger"" by Diana Schwarzbein, M.D. This woman is an endocrinologist who explains her way of eating with biochemical proof. And no family celeb photos! Do yourself a favor and buy the book from whom Suzanne Somers' got her information."
3,MORE FROM SUZANNE!,"Well, here's another option from Suzanne Somers on how to look and feel better and lose weight eating fats. - Does it really work? - Her research says yes! Anything that works is worth trying. The book offers ""Somersize"" facts and recipes to help weight-watchers eat food in right combinations. That, says Ms Somers is the key to shedding unwanted pounds. Included are health cautions regarding cholestral levels and dangers of hormone imbalance. Sweets, meats, and creamy sauces are among the permissable foods. This lady is like the energizer bunny- she just keeps finding ways to re-invent herself, and keeps us informed. An interesting approach to weight loss."
5,Love this product,I've used this massage gel before & was happy to see it on Amazon. I love to the feel of oil without the oil stains on my massage sheets. This product also last a long time!
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!,This was a fun and creative plot. The characters were real and you walk away having laughed and learned some too! I can also say that I am a voice actor and the detail in the book is pretty well documented. Keep up the fun writing Allie!
3,Fun and Quirky,"At first I wasn't so sure about this one, because it's definitely not what I'm used to reading. By the end I found it to be a fun - and definitely a little quirky - read."
1,Minus 5 Stars to this bands forever,This band stinks The first tought it was gonna be something like Soulfly but this stupid band is crap and after listening the first Album I gave it back 'cause it stinks.Now the second one it's worst.So dont buy this cd buy something better like Soulfly or Slipknot or Korn or Sepultura.
5,required film school reading,"As with all the Research Series books, Incredibly Strange Films lavishes the reader with little known information on a marginal subject with great detail. I originally received this book in 1986 and was immediately impressed with the exhaustive research of all our forgotten films as well as the profiles on directors such as H.G. Lewis. It also includes a helpful index (as far as I can remember) that will send you running for the video store. I haven't written a book on films but I know that you need not be a film buff or major to enjoy this book. The photos are reason enough to buy this book.If you don't believe me, just view the cover!"
5,Incredibly Great Book,I owe my eclectic taste in cult cinema largely to this book. It was seminal for me when it came out!
2,Looking for Elizabeth Montgomery,I wanted the movie so bad and thought I had finally found it.I am glad I didn't order as I was looking for the movie with E.M. as well.Thanks for your input as I would have been very disappointed as well.
5,"Positives/Negatives of Div,Grad,Curl","The book was easy to read and learn from. It draws parallels with electric field ""stuff"" which really adds to the understanding you gain from the math discussions, even if you are not already familiar with electric fields. The book provides concise discussions on the div, grad, and curl operators; however, it is not organized like a reference book or text book (e.g. it lacks tables of these operators expressed in cylindrical and spherical coordinates). I highly recommend reading through this book if you are at all confused about what div, grad, and curl are, the differences between them, or why you should be interested in them."
2,"not enough examples, not for self study","This might make a great review book if one is well versed in this topic or has studied said material and feels at home with cartesian, cylindrical and rectangular coordinates and multiple integrals.I really tried to learn from this book and like it, but I have had to put in on the shelf for a later time. If you want self study, get Stroud's excellent Vector Analysis, or video dvd's from ebay [..]; these dvd's are great, almost like being in a classroom and one can use any text (or no text as long as one follows the instructor's examples)."
2,Somehow makes vector calculus even more complicated,"I bought this book to help me with a class called ""Fields and Waves"", which deals with electromagnetics, so that I could show up and not be totally lost at the beginning, and use it as a reference throughout the course. It failed to do the former and was useless for the latter. It makes no reference to the spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems, which you need in order to save yourself about 120 steps for certain problems. All it goes over is the Cartesian coordinate system, which is not useful unless you are working with a square surface or volume. Well, most electrical structures are either spherical or cylindrical. This book may be inexpensive, but it is not useful for a class in electromagnetics."
3,Perfect for physicists and enginneers.,"I got this book for self-study to attempt a thorough introduction to vector-calculus and multivariable calculus. THIS IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A THOROUGH BOOK ON MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS, as it does not cover topics such as Green's Theorem or Directional derivatives. The author also states the like in his preface and introduction and the basic background needed. This book should serve as a reference. This book contains a great many applications to physics, though it is not required to understand the text, thus it does not fair well as a pure mathematics book. Thus I would recommend this book to a physicist or engineer weak or rusty in vector calculus."
4,A Classic,This book requires a pre-requesite course inmulti-variable calculus before one can really absorb it.A background course in Electrodynamics (or physics) wouldalso be helpful
4,A Good Introduction to Basic Vector Calculus,"This book is ideal for students with a basic multivariable calculus background that wish to start learning vector calculus. It really covers just the basics: calculating line and surface integrals, the divergence and Gauss' Theorem, the curl and Stokes' Theorem, and the gradient. Oddly, the gradient was one of the last things treated in the book, rather than one of the first which is more standard.Each chapter ends with exercises to help the reader along.The only thing really wrong with this book is that while it is quite elementary in scope, it is quite expensive. I wouldn't have bothered reading it if I hadn't been able to pick it up on the cheap. Other than that though, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to make the jump to vector calculus."
5,Simply amazing,This little gem of a book is simply amazing. It managed to explain in a clear and concise manner how line and surface integrals are derived along with how div and curl are tied into those. Something Anton and Larson (with the latter making a considerably better effort) could not achieve. Everything started to make sense after reading/referencing this book.
4,Great book,"This book has been helping generations of math students on vector calculus. It is a great presentation of the subject with lots of helpful diagrams (those are hard to find in more formal texts). The back page has a good summary of all the formulas for cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinates. Every vector calculus student should read this."
5,As an educator and a parent of special needs kids I love this book!,"I teach Adaptive PE to students with a wide range of abilities. This book was an excellent reference book, with great examples and ideas. In addition, I am the parent of a child with Learning Disabilites. This book was really helpful because he is bright and articulate so many teachers and friends are surprised by his struggles in the classroom. This book has helped me, help his teachers work to his strengths and give him the help he needs. I would recommend this book to all teachers and parents."
3,If the Lock was better we would've kept it.,"My 8 yr old daughter wanted a ""locking"" diary. She wanted it to be pink and girlie--which this was--but it was all about the lock. Unfortunately, the lock and key for this book was real cheezy. After the key spun around in it a few times she was totally disappointed. (We have better luck opening the bathroom door with a bobby pin.) And re-locking it seemed even more difficult. Many of the diary's seem to use the same type of lock. What ever happened to the buckle that locked a book? They were better...."
5,A fun present for a person who likes to travel,"A friend of mine likes charm bracelets, and this was a fun present to give her when she came back from Europe."
1,I got skin rask after drinking it,"After drinking it for 1-2 weeks, I started to have skin rash on several areas of my body. You should read the article at [...] before drinking it."
1,Not a good idea at all,"What people say about this product is true. There are all these chemicals hidden beneath the protein that cytosport makes and its a shame that they do not care. While many say that there are these chemicals and stuff inside other food, such as fish, do we really think its ok to have it in this too? It is bad enough for us to be consuming from regular food, why add extra?"
3,ITs okay but not the best flavor,"It not my favorite flavor but not too bad, I bleded it with a real peach and it was a million times better"
4,It's Science Food!,"It definitely tastes better than plain whey, and pure protein isn't the only key to getting strong. Frankly I don't understand it, but I recover more quickly when I use this stuff. It would be five stars if it wasn't so damn expensive."
5,Tasty!,I got the chocolate mix and it's delicious. I just ordered another 4.96lbs but wished they had more flavors in this size.
5,it dose the job,Muscle milk is the best food sublaiment i ever hade to increas mymuscle mass....I am 28 years old and I have been training for 8 yearsTrust me its the best for now.
3,Better than the already mixed kind!,Was buying the already premixed kind. Like this so much better! You can puck how thick you'd like it! Good option for those sick of buying some every week!
4,"Tastes alright, does the trick","It's got a pretty decent taste, and it has all the nutrients you need before/after a workout. Great product to have around for the serious exercisers. I use it after I'm done with P90x, and it's been great."
5,Muscle Milk ... mmm mmm good.,"I've tried many of the protein shakes out there. Muscle Milk is my favorite. I won't pretend to have micro-analyzed the differences in supplements, but I do know that this one gives me positive results. And, beyond its formulation, MM is to blend (use a shaker, or even a spoon if you don't mind a few chunks), and it tastes great in milk or water."
5,Great product at an afforable price,"I love this stuff. Not only does it taste good enough, but Amazon offers it at a very reasonable price."
5,Only one I can stand. Water Mixed,"First off let me say I've tried the following flavors. All water mixed only.XF - Arctic LemonadeGNC Pro Performance AMP Amplified Wheybolic Extreme 60 - Chocolate/Cookies and CremeGNC Beyond RAW Re-Built Mass - Chocolate BrownieCytoSport Muscle Milk - Peanut Butter ChocolateGNC Pro Performance 100% Whey Protein - UnflavoredBy far Muscle Milk Cookie Dough was the easiest to down. Doesn't EXACTLY smell or taste like cookie dough but it does well enough that it's not gross like some of the other stuff I've tried. Going on my 4th tub of the stuff so you can clearly see it's good enough that I repurchase the same flavor. Results wise, I've seen no reason to change."
4,Tastes great!,Muscle milk tastes great. I actually prefer syntha-6 taste a little better and I should have bought the smaller bottle of this.
5,Great tasting,I've tried quite a few protein products out there; and decided to go with a more expensive one for my post-workout shakes. At first I was skeptical about this one and the taste. But I've now found myself craving it and looking forward to this as my post-workout shake. Tastes excellent with 12oz skim milk and an ice cube to really chill it. Will be purchasing again. Cannot say definitively if it's made a difference in my physique though compared to any others. (I use optimum nutrition as my 'budget' protein for morning shakes)
2,Horrible - not like premade muscle milk,"YUCK!!! The taste is so grainy. And if you ever drink protein shakes, you want it to go down smoothly like a milk shake. Even when i tried mixing this with milk and shaking the heck out of it, i can still taste the grainy powder.The ""premade"" muscle milk that you buy in the store are really good. However, do not expect the same quality taste with this.I opted to buy an alternative - BSN Syntha 6 - and this was a thousand times better. Try that instead."
4,Good recovery option,"I'm a marathon runner and I use Muscle Milk as post-run recovery drink. I tried it with milk and found it to be too thick and heavy. It works better with ice cold water and is still delicious. It dissolves better, too. I honestly can't compare it to other protein powders as this is the only one I've used, but this product certainly aids in muscle recovery, especially after my long weekend runs."
5,YUM,"We love muscle milk. All the flavors are pretty good. I like that it can mixed with either water or milk.Great for me when I had gestational diabetes, this kept my blood sugar level down in the morning, but was a fast breakfast."
3,"Decent product, not great though.","Just got mine. For some reason it is very clumpy in the container. It doesn't taste particularly good, its rather chalky, even when mixed in with fruit and yogurt and water. Has more sodium than I like, 6% of the DV, and I believe 9g/protein per serving, which is not that much. Doubt I will reorder this when I run out. Decent price though."
4,tastes delicious,tastes delicious and it is a good price. i love it and its my favorite protein to drink while working out
3,Hard to clean glasses after using,"Tastes fine, has plenty of protein, however it is extremely sticky on my glasses and is very difficult to clean glasses after using. Much more than other powders I have used. All my glasses are kind of cloudy now."
4,quality product,"good protein supplement. It is a pretty chalky product, but mixes with water well as long as you stir it vigorously. Tastes sweet more than chocolatey."
4,Tastes and works great!,I've been using Muscle Milk for years and I'm always amazed at how awesome it tastes. I love trying the new flavors and I'm never disappointed.
2,made me gain fat!,watch out! I got more flab with this than I should have. I need to stick with my whey powder I get from a local distributor.
3,Muscle Milk,"I have been using this product for almost two months,but I did not notice any significant changes on my muscles."
5,Great Product!,Great product for creatine phosphate/ protein replenishment. Great taste and great effects. Highly recommend the Mocha Latte flavor. Very low sugar for great taste.
3,Tastes like sand,"I was told muscle milk was a good product so i decided to try it out. I have to say i wouldnt buy it again. Im not sure how well the results are yet(only been taking it for about a week)but the vanilla flavor is extremely sweet, more than other protiens ive tried. Also it is very sandy, if you've taken powdered creatine before than you know what i mean. Best protein ive had is BSN ""True Mass"". Great taste and great results. (plus it doesnt give you gas lol)"
2,Uh Oh,"After ordering this, I saw on Fox News and Consumer Reports that this is really unhealthy. I can not believe they market this stuff w/o regard for the dangerous levels of heavy metals that are in it. Shame on Muscle Milk!"
2,"Tasty, but...","...recent Consumer Reports testing indicates:The worst of the products tested was MUSCLE MILK CHOCOLATE powder, which contained all four TOXIC METALS; three of them at the highest levels of all products tested. Three daily servings of this particular brand and flavor contained an average of:* 5.6 g cadmium* 13.5 g of lead* 12.2 g of arsenic* 0.7 g of mercuryMuscle Milk's Vanilla Crème contained slightly less lead, but still exceeded the USP lead limit of 10 g."
3,maybe its for you.,"this muscle milk is ok tasting for this type of drink. i haven't seen any results, but maybe i haven't used enough. it is to strong tasting for my likings. as i drink this stuff i have to thin out each drink with equally as much water. i am planing on getting another flavor."
2,Do not buy the Peach Mango,"The Peach Mango flavor muscle milk is the worst flavor muscle milk I have tried, I loved the Cookie and Creme and the Strawberry Banana flavors but this one is awful."
1,can't recommend,"I really can't recommend this stuff.--The Vanilla Creme flavor that I ordered tastes like coconut, yuck. Which would be fine if that's what I was expecting, but it's not what I want after a workout.--The powder does not dissolve well at all. It clumps up into little ""protein balls"" which are unpleasant to swallow.--The high fat content of this stuff does not agree with my stomach at all, especially when I am working out."
1,"Awful flavor, AVOID!","Awful flavor, AVOID! Root Beer, Cookies and Cream, and Mint Chocolate are excellent and recommended. Stay away from Blueberry ugh!"
4,Nice alternative flavor,Was a little hesitant with the flavor but it turns out that it is actually good by itself. I have tried a few varieties and muscle milk is by far my favorite.
3,Too sugary,Tryin to maximize gains here. What is this? It's like drinking a milkshake. No go bro. Need cheap protein. Yea this is your stuff. Got decent calories though.
5,Great price for great protein!,"This flavor tastes great with fat-free milk and even water! Well worth buying on here verse the stores, you get double the volume for half the price!"
4,Yum,"Good quality protein powder. Does not taste bad at all. However, if mixed with water and left in your shaker cup for a few hours, basically starts to rot (?)/chunk up and smell awful. (Tip: wash IMMEDIATELY after use, do not even let used cup sit around for two long....otherwise mold will start growing in literally a day).Overall good product. I use after every lifting workout."
4,"Good item, clumsy way to order","The item itself is good. Good taste, good results.The problem I had was with Amazon's set up. The drop-down menus only allow you to order one flavor at a time and it defaults to chocolate milk if there's a glitch in the ordering process. If you order it directly from Amazon's partner each flavor is listed seperately to avoid these problems."
2,"good for you taste buds, bad for your heart","I give it a 5 stars for the taste and a 1 star for the 8 grams of saturated fat. Unless you are young with a high metabolism or do lots of cardio, muscles milk will make you fatter and clog your arteries after many years of taking this product. Your longterm health is more important than building muscles now. if you take this 3 times a day, that is 24 grams of Saturated fat. Saturated fat raises your cholesterol and cholesterol clogs arteries which causes stroke and heart attacks. You might as well eat dominos pizza 3 times a day. Pizza's high in saturated fat and protein just like this powder. I recommend Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold. It has 1/16th of the saturated fat. THe downside is it doesn't taste as good as Muscle Milk. M M tastes damn good. Optimum Nutrition has a cheaper price per serving. The choice is yours. If I were 18 again I would probably go with M M, but now I'm 33 and more mature so I worry about more than just getting big muscles."
1,if you have a sensitivity to fake sugar: DO NOT BUY,"this stuff is disgusting. its like drinking pure splenda. gave me a headache and made me sick. awful awful awful. i dont even get it! why add fake sugar? i stopped buying optimum nutrition because it was off the grocery discount, and id ont remember that having real sugar, definitely didnt have fake sugar, and tasted GREAT!"
5,i love it,i need some more buy some sooon and thank you so much and to company the best in world for banana cream i love it mmm
4,Hits the spot and helps with my recovery,"I am an avid CrossFit competitor and coach. I needed a good protein for recovery after my workouts and that I could also use as a meal replacement. Muscle Milk hit the spot...and to boot, it tastes great. I actually look forward to my daily protein recovery routine. My boyfriend and I have tried several other brands, but at this price point, none could compete."
5,Good Stuff,"I prefer MM to other products, and you cannot beat the prices here. Make sure to check for the NCAA-approved version if you play college sports."
4,Excellent protein,"One of the best tasting protein supplements I've found. Truly tastes like a milk shake. Good protein content. At $25 a bottle, a great price also...I noticed that GNC now prices the Muscle Milk proteins at the exact same price that Amazon has been providing to us for years...I'd like to believe this is because the power of the Internet changed how greedy stores price their products. GNC was charging almost $45 dollars for the exact same bottle...Thanks Amazon!"
3,Old stock,"Of all the proteins i have tried Musle milk is the best for me. However, two of the last three buys from my amazon supplier tasted flat and rather poor. perhaps their stock of Mocha joe is old? i hope they fix there problem when they do perhaps i will re-order then."
4,Great Taste & Works Well,"It's difficult for me to say how effective this fat/protein/carbo combination works compared to other muscle building shakes which consist of mainly whey protein, but it does indeed help burn fat (when combined with regular exercise of course) and it tastes great. So many health shakes taste chalky or just plain bad, but this product really tastes great mixed with skim milk. I highly recommend it."
1,Peach Mango does not taste good,"I was excited about this as I had the same flavor from a different brand (a zero carb brand) and had seen this brand a lot and assumed, by its popularity, that it tasted decent. I expected to get a similar taste to the other mix, just with a few carbs which I did not mind. Not at all, the mix tastes very chemically and artificially sweet which Im not usually especially sensitive to. I mean I didn't expect it to taste exactly like fresh peach/mango but this is way off. Would not recommend & disappointed that despite the taste guarantee on the label I wont be able to return it through Amazon."
1,Beware: Muscle Milk is alleged to have dangerous levels of cadmium and lead,"I was very disappointed to learn about a Consumer Reports report in July 2010 suggesting that Muscle Milk has dangerous levels of cadmium and lead in its protein powder products:[...]Rather than make an effort to address the issue, CytoSport responded that the levels of these elements are within safe limits. I have therefore lost confidence in CytoSport products."
3,Strawberry Milkshake (actually it's Strawberries N' Creme),"The strawberries n' creme is the worst muscle milk flavor I've tried so far. It's not horrible, but it tastes like medicine. When mixed with water it's really difficult to drink, but better when with milk."
2,"Not very good taste and loaded with fat and calories, not LEAN protein.","Muscle Milk gets very good reviews online and from other members of my gym, so I figured I would give it a try. Unfortunately, it is more of a mass gainer than just lean protein, but, that is not why I am giving it two stars. I should have done my research before switching from my Syntha 6 and Optimum Nutrition Whey. The reason I am giving it two stars is the taste. The chocolate is terrible. I do have the banana Muscle Milk and it tastes pretty good even compared to my favorite, which is Syntha 6's banana. The banana would probably get 4 stars. The muscle milk does contain a whole assortment of vitamins, aminos, and healthy fats. Not as much protein per serving as Syntha 6 though. Overall, muscle milk is just not for me, perhaps the Light version of the banana would be more to my liking."
1,"Turrible, simply turrible!",This is the worst protein powder I have ever taken. It did not provide recovery for my muscles after a hard workout. It gave me horrible gas and i passed most of the product. My body fat % has gone up since using this product and my muscles have gotten less defined. A good protein powder should restore your strenth 2 to 3 hours after a hard work out. This product does nothing for me. I won't ever use this product again.
2,$$$ per ounce,"This particular product indicates that it is .56 cents per ounce. Which sounds very inexpensive. But I able to go to a local convenient store/gas station and purchase a 14 oz. Muscle Milk ready to drink shakefor only $3.69, which puts it at .26 cents per ounce. Intresting..... I always thought that the powder form was the least amount as far as $$$$."
2,Cytosport muscle milk,"this product content a little powder, the container look big but when you see inside it nothing. I think is reaper you money and the product is no healthy and taste is disgusting..."
1,Not what I ordered. Label is different and so are the ingredients from the advertised photo,"I would like to know how to cancel my automatic reordering that I placed on this item. You know this is not what I ordered. You sent me a product with a different label... Compare the ingredients of both labels, they are different."
3,"Good as a snack, not so much as a workout supplement","This tastes great, but compared to other proteins, seems to be pretty high in calories and carbs while being comparitively low in actual grams of protein per scoop. It tastes good enough - really, it's better than a lot of junk foods in this department - but it's not a great choice for people using it solely for it's nutritional benefits."
3,Blueberries and Creme - not loving the flavor.,"I've tried a few of MM's flavors and while this Blueberries and Creme isn't the worst, it's certainly not the best. The berry flavor is weak, especially compared to their strawberry flavor.I won't be getting this flavor again."
3,Least favorite flavor.,"I drink Muscle Milk every morning for my breakfast. This is my least favorite flavor but I tolerated it to finish it off. I enjoy the Mocha Latte and the Chocolate Malt. I got them on the Subscribe & Save for a great deal. They are delivered automatically with free shipping every 3 months. So I don't get the full 300 calories in one shot, I only put one scoop in (instead of 2) stir well with spoon, add some ice and then drink it through a straw. It tastes best ice cold. Then when I get hungry a couple hours later, I make another one using one scoop. Then I have a light lunch around 11:30."
5,Great Product!!!,I started taking Muscle Milk for about 3 weeks now and i have seen MAJOR results!!! It is definitley one of my best health investments. I have already gained 15 lbs in muscle and am still going strong!!! As for the taste? I'm using the Cookies&cream flavor and it taste GREAT!!! Which i was definitley skeptical about.i whole heartedly recommend this product.
3,The taste of the the STRAWBERRY Muscle Milk is not as good as the other Muscle Milk flavors,"Although the Strawberry flavor has the same nutritional value, it has a chemical after-taste to it. The BANANA CREME flavor is awesome."
2,Disgusting,This stuff is absolutely disgusting. And my muscles were sore for days after workouts even after I used 2+ servings of the Muscle Milk. I mean it's a good value and all but I wouldn't recommend the vanilla flavor...
2,disappointed,"I am disappointed with this product. It doesn't seem to work like I had hoped. I tried it by my computer, which is connected to a wireless router with the status ""excellent"" signal strength, and the WiFi spy does not indicate any signal. It did indicate some signal closer to the router, but it seems to work very sporadically. Does not seem to be very sensitive."
4,GOod video,Neat to actually get to see Juliette in the video and listen to her talk and her life story. I was hopeful that it would show her harvesting several different types of herbs and also working with them in her kitchen.
5,Lovely,This video portrays the essence of Juliette de Bairacli Levy in all her glory. Viewing this video imparts one with the peace and beauty through which the late great Juliette saw and lived her life.It leaves you wanting more. Worth watching over and over again.She was/is a great teacher as she lived in harmony with life around her.
4,BED:STU Boots,"Great, old-fashioned style boots with wooden soles, often uncommon in contemporary footwear. Handmade, these boots are comfortable. They are a little slippery and require some breaking in."
1,Bummer,"I picked up this CD for the sole reason of getting a copy of the song Queen of Argyll. Unfortunately, this is not the traditional folk version. The song, like all others on the album, has been electrified and the changes really destroy a fine tune. I found this album to be a huge dissapointment."
4,A book of comfort and encouragement,"I have found this book a great comfort and encouragement in my situation as I am married to an unbelieving husband. The book has shown me that despite our problems we can and will stay together and be happily married. One of the great things is to read of other people in the same situation and see that they stayed together, as you know of many divorces caused by this different view on religion.Despite the book's many strong points I occasionally found its view quite ""traditional"" (wife at home etc.) and it is indeed written quite a few years ago. The culture here in Scandinavia is somewhat different but many things are of course the same despite the time or geography.I would like to recommend the book for everyone in a marriage with an unbelieving partner!"
5,Great Album!!,"I was looking for some new music and came across this album. I listened to the sample music on Amazon and then read the review by Mike McGonigal.DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING!!!!!!!This album is full of great lyrics, melodies and hooks in every song! Jen's voice is amazing and the production is as good as any mega-stars' label could come up with. Anybody out there that wants to embrace an up and coming star should buy this CD!!"
5,Excellent CD!!!,"I strongly recommend Jen Foster's ""Everybody's Girl."" I purhcased this CD more than three months ago and have been listening to it regularly ever since. The favorable reviews posted here are right on, as this disc contains a number of great songs!"
5,I Love Jen Foster!!,I have never heard of Jen Foster before I bought the cd. I just took a chance. I love Jen Foster. I am telling eveyone about Jen Foster. Every song on the cd is so good and so meaningful. I highly suggest this cd. Then you too will be hooked on Jen Foster.
4,Finally a strong female Rocker!!!,I was pleasantly surpised to hear a female pop/rock singer with a voice that packs a punch! The lyrics are empowering and the melodies are hypnotic! I love this CD!!!
2,Good Songwriting - Bad Singing,"Jen Foster has an amazing talent for songwriting. Unfortunately, she should have stopped there. In a failed attempt to sound like a cross between Melissa Etheridge, Joan Armatrading and Joan Osborne - the tone of her voice becomes monotonous and irritating. There is a sense of premature conceit that is only acceptable from a seasoned performer.I recommed her CD only because the songwriting is so incredible. There is an honesty rarely found in today's songwriters."
4,"Direct Replacement Guard - Nothing More, Nothing Less","Direct replacement for my broken/missing guard.Does not include mounting hardware.Other than it shipped promptly and arrived in new condition, there's not much else I can write about this item."
4,Lyin' like a fool,"This CD features songs that Elvis Presley recorded on March 31, 1972 (my fifth birthday!). This was a rehearsal for the King's upcoming tour. Normally, a rehearsal wouldn't be recorded, but this one was taped to have material for the documentaryElvis On Tour. As far as I recall, ""Separate Ways"" was the only song from the rehearsal to be included in the movie. This is Elvis and his touring group, minus the female singers and the orchestra. So, it kind of sounds like live recordings, but more stripped down and without an audience. The material is pretty much the same songs he did on tour, with the exception of an off the cuff version of ""Young and Beautiful"". As for ""El Paso"", don't get your hopes up. The band is tuning up, and what they are playing reminds Elvis of ""El Paso"", so he sings the first two lines of the song, and that's it. This is an enjoyable CD for Elvis fans."
5,Perfect,"If you're lucky enough to own a first-generation LS, you know the only thing that goes bad is the A/C, the electronics, and the suspension. This will help with the latter.Installation is way easier than you may think. You just need a jack, some sockets and a torque wrench. I did both upper control arms (the only way to replace upper ball joints) both lower control arms, and these lower ball joints plus the sway bar link ends on my 91 LS in an afternoon. That's the entire front end rebuilt in a day! It's just bolts, you can do it.You won't believe the difference! Clunks are gone, wandering at high speeds is gone, the smooth luxury has returned!You will find excellent picture tutorials for this procedure on Lexus forums."
1,Failed and dropped daughter into public toilet!!,"I did not get this item through Amazon but I am upset enough about it to post a review. My daughter will be 3 in July. She weighs 32 lbs. She has been very hesitant to sit on the big potty (we have a toddler potty at home)but was excited to see Dora on her potty seat. Used it maybe 3 times. The last time, we were at Walmart and she had to go potty so we ran into the bathroom with the potty seat, set it up and I placed her on it. It almost immediately caved in and dropped my daughter into the filthy public toilet, banging her ribs on the toilet on her way in. I am furious!! Not only was it completely unsanitary but now she will not go near a big potty at all.It seemed like a perfect solution: portable, cheap and sanitary, but ended up just being cheap and not worth the trauma to my daughter. Hope this saves someone else the disappointment."
5,T. Martin,"this is a must have for all mothers who are potty training....folds up great for travel, your child can feel safe sitting on ""restroom"" toilets with this potty seat"
1,literally better than nothing,"i suppose this seat is better than layering tons of toilet paper on a toilet bowl. this folding seat may be appealing to little ones because it comes decorated with familiar characters (e.g., sesame street, dora, etc). but there is nothing to hold it in place on a toilet seat. my twins can't relax enough to 'go' while sitting on it because the hinges are flimsy so the seat feels like it's about to give way under them. they're small (27lb) 2yos, so i can't imagine what would happen if they weighed more. save your money and get a more stable travel potty seat!"
3,"For the low price, it worked well","Hey, it doesn't replace a real potty seat, folks. You still have to hold on to your kid while they are going--but at least you don't have to hold them up, it makes them feel more secure. And it folds up small enough in its own little plastic bag to fit in the diaper bag without contaminating everything in it."
4,Very useful,This has been extremely useful during travel. Fits well on toilet seats on planes. Otherwise we would have had to resort to diapers for amy 3 year old who is getting potty trained.
2,i dont know,My friend had one of these and her daughter used it for public bathrooms. My daughter will not use it. We tried it at home and one time she got pinched by it.I have also tried it in public. Maybe she is too young for this seat. We us a Bjorn and a cushion seat and she does fine. She is almost 2.
1,nice idea,"I saw these and I liked them so much that I bought 2, one for my daughter (2 years old) and my neice (3 years old). They were both so excited to see the seats and to take them out and fold and unfold them. I sent one home with my niece and I kept one in my daughter's diaper bag. The next time we were in public, I was excited to pull out my toilet seat! That is, until I tried to set her up on it.. the ""nonslip pads"" did not work, the seat when sliding around and ended up in the toilet! We tried it again on the toilet at home with the same results! Arggg she won't even sit on it anymore! I called to ask my sister how she liked hers and she said that her daughter won't sit on it because it slides around too much and it scares her. After spending almost $30 on 2, I would say skip it!"
4,Dora the Potty Seat Explorer,"We love this seat! As the parents of two girls, it comes in very handy at any public restroom expecially the public portal potty."
4,exactly what i expected,Its exactly what ii expected it to be a travel toddler seat cover. Fits on all the seats I've ever attempted to put it on. Only con is I wish this travel seat cover came w some kind of travel bag to store it in- -- only sent in a ziploc bag inside the box. I would reccomend this product for a toddler on the go.
1,Terrible,"I am shocked to see that this seat did well at all! I purchased this out of desperation on a road trip. In less than 24 hours my daughter (32lbs.) 2 years 4 months fell off it twice! Both times adults were right there and the last time I was actually holding her as it fell into the McDonald's toilet (yuck!)The fist time it actually folded and pinched her on the butt, breaking the skin. There is nothing to keep it in place except some rubber pads at the bottom. Granted she was doing number 2 and had to sit a while longer then I think most kids. But criky this should work at all times! The whole point to this is so I didn't have to squat in front of a public toilet while I waited for her to go...the best place for this is in the trash!"
1,Pinches,We bought this because we travel a lot but it often pinches our daughter when she sits on it. We threw it away
4,Traveling Dora Potty Seat,"Love that it's portable, easy to wash, and not noticeable. The only problem I have is that it pops in toilet while child is on it sometimes. But overall a handy little thing."
4,Perfect for the non-liturgical church,"I have been creating banners with designs from this book for several years, learning as I go. Though we are not a liturgical church, the banners follow the ""church year"" and would be well suited to a more formal church as well. For others in more contemporary settings such as ours, there are many usable designs to fit various size spaces. The design elements include graphics with a brief text; the purpose being to provoke thought. I would certainly recommend this as a very usable tool."
3,Any Jaco is worth listening to...,"...and this is doubly valuable in that it was recorded on professional equipment (not transcribed from a Walkman), and that it features gypsy guitar hotshot Bireli Lagrene. This is a studio recording, unlike the other two in the set _Heavy 'n' Jazz_ and _Live in Italy_. It's a competent set of jazz-funk, nothing magic, nothing tragic."
3,Any Jaco is worth listening to...,"......and this is doubly valuable in that it was recorded on professional equipment (not transcribed from a Walkman), and that it features gypsy guitar hotshot Bireli Lagrene. This is a studio recording, unlike the other two in the set _Heavy 'n' Jazz_ and _Live in Italy_. It's a competent set of jazz-funk, nothing magic, nothing tragic.I resubmit this review, to link with my current list."
5,Reading Reading Vergil's Aeneid,"I am a student taking AP Latin: Vergil, as an independent study, and I have found this book to be very useful in its strong explication of the text and its focus on things that are not often noticed in criticism. The essays vary in quality, but they always provide a different perspective on such topics as Aeneas's relations with family and nation, the old question of whether Dido or Aeneas is really in the wrong, imagery, translations, and parallels with other ancient works. If you are a high school teacher looking for materials to use with a class, be aware that many of these essays use very modern critical approaches, and some of them are difficult to understand, but some would be fine for the average student. The book overall has a strong feminist slant. I thought it was really excellent, and I would recommend this thought-provoking book to any reader looking for modern scholarly interpretations."
3,Beat Up,"I received this book on 12/26/2012 and the corners were beat up due to improper handling in the shipping. I wanted to give it as a gift but now because of the beat up and dirty corners I won't. It doesn't look ""New"" anymore."
3,Toy not much fun for my 4 yr old. Passed it along to my 2 yr old,I got the scoot skate for my 4 year olds Birthday. He wasn't too happy about the skate's performance. It didn't turn right or left and it didn't go very fast. My 2 year old loved it and we gave it to him. We ended up getting my 4 year old a Razor Scooter.
1,"do not buy this cd, you will be disappointed","there is nothing good about this cd. i only paid a few dollars for it and i still feel ripped off. The rock n roll songs are okay for single time swing, but they are also very annoying to listen to. the rest is absolutely atrocious. the tangos are synthesized, the waltz sounds bad and is in v waltz time, so not even useable if you wanted to. the charleston is okay for a foxtrot, but why would you want to dance to that noise? most of the cd is synthesized and horrible. the rest doesnt make me want to dance. i only wish i could rate it a zero. there are much better choices for a dance compilation."
4,Vietnam Spool Show gets it right,"If you want a glimpse into Navy life, this book fills that need in spades. From the vocabulary to the playing of tricks on shipmates one can see how sailors in general and Intel folks in particular deal with the stress of war. I hope the author will consider writing another novel. I was enthralled from start to finish."
5,MY Uncle's Book,My Uncle wrote this book when I was 7 or 8 perhaps. I finally read the book an dit makes me realize what he went through. I have been looking for another copy of this book. Thank you to everyone who has read the book. His dream was to one day have a book published and he did it!
2,Eh....,"This book is interesting almost exclusively for the details it provides of how the signals collection worked during Viet Nam. It shows how this collection was used to track pilots and dogfights, leading (one hopes) to their rescue. There are a few illuminating tidbits about Vietnamese language and culture. Otherwise, the writing and plotting is painfully pedestrian, so don't get this book expecting any real reading pleasure."
4,calcium perch,"Our Quaker gets on it some. If you have a quaker, buy the small size - the medium is a little large for our bird."
1,An amateurish production,"The DVD looks like something cobbled togeher by a committee of well-intended amateurs trying to save money on what they put together. The sound is especially crude. The subject, Gaudi's cathedral in Barcelona,is, when seen in person, one of the most beautiful and stunning creations on earth. This production does not do it justice."
4,VERY WORTH IT - EVEN CONSIDERING THE TWINLAB ISSUE,"My suspicion is TwinLab products are as good or better than most others out there. But regardless of how you feel about Dr. Colgan's endorsement of that brand, the great thing about this book is he cites specific studies and their results to support his conclusions. You have the actual facts to make your own conclusions. My lifestyle has changed dramatically for the better since reading this and I find myself going back to look things up more than any other book I have."
3,This book was top-notch when published in 1993.,Dr. Colgan's book on nutrition deserved accolades when first published. Since it's publication there has been a wealth of published studies which deserve to be incorporated in an update of this fine book. I only hope Dr. Colgan's financial interests in TwinLab and his newsletter don't preclude the considered revision his readers deserve.
3,Things keep changing,"I think Dr. Colgan is a brilliant person on the subject of nutrition and supplmentation. There is a lot of very good information in the book, but I do believe Dr. Colgan misses on some supplements that have proven to be very effective. One of these is Colostrum, I use this personally and for many clients. it is a great immune system modulator that will innately get your immune system balanced. I to think you can take too many supplements and need a program to follow. That's why at Unique Fitness we follow the model of Foundational product - Adaptogen product - Targeted product for those needing to target specific challenges - Specialty products for those occasional conditions that ""pop"" up and to also keep the holistic medicine chest stocked with nature's best. Good book, with some updates needed. [...]"
5,Optimum Sports Nutrition : Your Competitive Edge,"simply the best nutrition book available! humerously written, even a complete novice would enjoy and understand."
2,Misleading item description!,"Buyers, read the item description carefully! Then, re-read it! This entry is NOT for a PAIR of antenna adapters. If you're trying to hook up an FM Modulator, this is 1/2 of what you need. The ""Technical Details"" says ""Antenna Adapters for Adding CD with FM Modulator"". But the product description says, ""Converts aftermarket antenna to VW/Audi/European factory radio with flat connector.""You're getting ONE cable, in the picture, it's the upper cable, the one that converts the ""standard plug"" on your vehicle antenna, to the 90 degree flat plug. If you need both - you must also purchase the sister for this - Metra 40-VW10 10-Inch VW Antenna Adapter.Happy with the product, but I had to order the other, and wait for it to ship. Needless delay. I'm ready to install NOW.AMAZON - PLEASE CHANGE THE PICTURE AND REMOVE MY REVIEW."
5,Works great,I used this to help install an FM modulator in my BMW. It worked as described and seemed of good quality
5,Excellent product,"This product refines the texture of the skin; minimizing poors, smoothing, and brightening. I have used this for many years in addition to retin-a. Good for anyone that wants to reduce and minimize the signs of aging skin."
3,I've used cheaper,"Compares the same with my $8.00 Neutrogena facial cream. I thought this product had more to offer, but it doesn't."
1,Broke me out,I tried this brand after Glytone reformulated their products. I would not recommend this product to anyone with acne prone skin. It gave me an outbreak of acne.
2,PWC Kwik Tek Bumpers,I have two jetskis and needed something to keep the dock from scratching them when tied up to the dock. These are almost useless. The bumpers or fenders do not stay on very well. Wave action dislodges them.
4,They do there job,"Well they do there job, its kind of a pain in the but, but you really need these for when your docking your jetski. saved my jetski from several chipps and dents and dings! easy to use sometimes when wet there are a pain but nothing to bad. 4/5"
1,Does NOT work with the V3,"I purchased a Razr V3 for my dad for his birthday. His last cell phone was never charged, because he took the charger to work and left it there. I bought this travel charger to go with his gift so he'd have a charger at home and a charger at work. This charger did not work. At all."
3,There are few keepers in here...,"Not a beautiful book, and not a low-fat book. This book does not include any animal products, but most recipes are very high in fat. The recipes I tried are not the most visually appealing, but many have tasted great. Miso Macaroni is a regular around here now, and the Apple Loaf Cake so sooo yummy. Rice Casserole was good but NOT very pretty. I am glad I wasn't having guests over to impress. I ended up breaking it apart, putting it in whole what tortillas with salsa, and it was a HIT! For the low price I paid for the book, I would say it was worth it for the few recipes that we now use regularly, and who knows, i am sure I will discover another gem from this book eventually."
2,Too much Tofu and Fat,"I like the actual vegetable recipes, but many of the others incorporate tofu, which to me is horrible tasting. Some of the recipes are strange tasting such as the Spinach Quiche and the Tempeh Cabbage Casserole. I could barely eat either of these. I did love the Curried Saute. I also liked the Pasta Primavera. The hummus Dip was extremely salty (must be a misprint, 5 Tbsp of Tamari), could not eat it. Also, the Apple Loaf cake was really sweet, dense, and mushy (had to bake it forever) and very fattening. I have not tried all the recipes but it seems this book is too inconsistent. Another problem is, some of the ingredients are not easily found at your local grocery store. So you need to either order them online or schlepp to Whole Foods. In addition, these recipes have a lot of fat. Some recipes even have you deep fry in oil, which is very unhealthy. I think the Moosewood cookbooks are far better than this one. Sorry Morty. :("
1,Pancakes were a flop - is the rest?,"I bought this cookbook in the airport. I liked how simple the recipes looked and thought I'd try it. I tried only one recipe so far, the Pancakes of While Wheat. It was a total flop. The pancake ""batter"" wasn't a batter at all, but a paste. I know what people will think - that I must have put too much of a dry ingredient in the recipe, but I swear I followed the recipe. Now I am worried that the whole book is a total scam. Is this book for real? Did anyone else have better luck with the pancake recipe? I am pretty skeptical of trying any of the other recipes now. It seems like a waste of time- and money."
1,DONT BUY LG PRODUCTS,"My husband and I purchased this product in June, 2007. From the time we connected the set there was a problem with the screen. Our set has a thin black horizonal line thru middle of the screen. We were instructed to contact LG for warranty. LG told us to contact their local contracted service company. The service company has been out twice and has changed 3 boards and we still have the line. LG has been uncooperative about replacing the TV. It has not worked since DAY 1 !"
3,Nice story but..,"I love to read uplifting and insprational books to my kids at bedtime. They love to hear about the lives of saints after we read the Bible. It is a great story about Martin de Porres and how he devoted his life to God. However, there is one page that is halfway through the book that I had to skip because it's too scary for kids to hear at night. It goes on about how 'the evil one' visited St. Martin in his room one night and beat him up. I think the publishers should have left this page out because it is especially frightening to children. Other than that it's a good story about a good saint."
5,Deceptively complex book,"Cantu addresses the harsh realities of racism, poverty and Viet Nam without bashing you over the head with strident platitudes. The framework structure coupled with family album snaphots make the book fascinating and truly accessible for a variety of readers. One need not have grown up in los dos Laredos or along the U.S.--Mexican border to identify with this work; one need only be aware of the variety of borders constructed or imposed upon our lives."
2,It tries too hard to be meaningful.,"I enjoy reading Chicano/Latino literature, and I have taken multiple college courses on the subject. However this book did not impress me. There was hardly anything I chose to underline, and at times I felt the author went too far in interpreting the photographs. One such instance occurs when Cantu describes a child's eyes as sad and thinking about the difficult time ahead; for me, it was just pushing it too far to create symbolism and meaning where there is no place for it.It was an OK book, a simple read that you can finish in one night, but it failed to grasp me emotionally and intellectually. I thought the author lacked substance that I so hoped for when I began to read."
4,Better than expected!!,"I'm not a fan of CHICANA literature, MEXICAN AMERICAN literature, and other related genres. However, I had to read this for one of Professor Cantu's classes and I actually enjoyed the book. I finished it in one evening. It's an interesting and dramatic fictionalized memoir the has earned a spot on my bookshelf as one of my top books."
1,awful,"As a woman, I really wanted to like this book, but basically, it's awful. Any book that starts out with a mention of Roland Barthes puts the reader on notice that the writer has something to prove. And when the word ""lover"" shows up on the first page, you know you are in trouble-- it's written by someone who has to prove modern academic and social ""credentials,"" whatever that means. Combine these two minor problems with the fact that the book has no apparent organization (based on a series of random selections of family pictures) and no historical structure, and you get the idea. There are some really great books about immigrant families in the Southwest, including Cajas de Cartón (okay, so it's California, mainly), The Rain God, and John Phillip Santos' book Things Left Unfinished at the Time of Creation. Unfortunately, this book isn't even in the same ballpark as the others. I simply can't recommend it."
5,Wonderful,Joann is an anointed sister and she has done it again on her second album. Her testimony is amazing and shows the soverignty of our Father! I believe that when he restored her voice he made it better than it was before! She displays her passion and exemplifies what it means to a women in love with the Lord! I love every last song! A Definite recommendation!!
5,Wonderful CD,"I love this CD, it is a beautiful CD. This is my 1st CD by Joann Rosario and I love it so much and am very happy with it. All the songs are very nice and uplifting."
4,Downrod,The downrod for the Hunter fan was a perfect fit and matche4s the Hunter fan that it was attached too.Quick shipping and packageing.Good people to do business with..
4,Asi asi,"The Ork Boyz is great for rush attacks as well as human barriers. They are ideal against Imperial Guardsmen, and when used correctly, can destroy a single stronghold within two or three turns. This is a perfect way to start an Ork army, but be sure to purchase the buggy(or whatever they call it here)for a great battalion"
2,false advertisement,i purchased this product from frp games due to the fact the box says that it contains enough parts to make 16 boyz. after i opened the package a few days later though this was not the case the box's picture was different from the one shown here and it only contained 10 boyz do not buy this unless your willing to get 10 boyz for the price of 16
5,Must read for lovers of words,"The contents may be offensive to some readers. So be it! Words and their usage are part of our language. As an aside, I'd like to see someone take on the task of relating euphemisms to short titles of Congressional bills: Leave No Child Behind Act; Fair Tax Act; The USA Patriot Act; Help American Vote Act..."
1,Very Sad,"Overemphasis on sexual material. Would not have bought the book had I known this.Believe Amazon ""missed the boat"" in recommending it to the general public. I am very disappointed."
3,"Good recipes, but not well ordered","If you love Moroccan food but have never made it, this is the book for you. The steps for preparation are easy to follow and the food is delicious. However, the recipes are not as well categorized as they should be. Recipes seem to follow a certain indexing, but once you flip through the pages they are all over the place. I want all my main dishes under main dishes ... not the case here."
3,Good first time cooking book,This is a good book to start learning how to cook Moroccan food. Nice pictures to go along with the recipes. But if you are cooking for a Moroccan some of the recipes aren't what they are used to eating.
1,"Great Expectations, Poor Results","Vladimir Nabokov is one of the great authors of the 20th century, both as a craftsman and stylist in the novel form. He even succeed in grand poetry (Pale Fire), so one would think that his literal translation of Oneigin would be a welcome publication. It's not. First, Nabokov strips Onegin of all poetics, which he admits is his intent. He believes the poem is better understood from a transliteral (almost interlinear) reading than from a poetic reconstruction. This attempt may please, and I stress ""may,"" those who, unfamiliar with Russian, and who want such a bland diet of lackluster prose. But there are so many excellent translations of Onegin that are beautiful and captivating in themselves, I'm not sure there's much need for such a literal, word-for-word, transcription. Perhaps this book belongs on the shelf along with other translations of Onegin, but it's not one I'll return to in the near future."
4,nice but,"i don't actually own this product, but it seems like the normal rashguard only with mysteriouso quality (great).my recomendation is to go to the mysteriouso site and look at their m-tech line,they have long and short sleve of the m-tech rashguard, it has a lining that feels kind of like flece, it's probably the most comfortable shirt i own (when the tempreature permits).Reasons it's awesome:it wicks water and liquid off your skin and dries quick in the open air;it keeps you warm while you're in the water;it makes a great first layer for snow sports, cold/wet weather, and water sports;i was a raft guide in the Kern River in Southern California and the m-tech mysteriouso kept me from hypothermia plenty of times, if you're in cold water often, Mysteriouso is a must"
3,The book made me sleepy. See the movie!,"Strange Cargo with Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, and Ian Hunter is one of my favorite Jesus pictures, if you know what I mean. So, I've always wanted to read the book that brought the film to life. After 20 or so years, I finally found a used copy of the book for sale from a library in England. I bought it, read it, and now I am so disappointed. The book sucks. The movie is so much better. The characters are more developed. The story is more compelling. And if I didn't love the movie, and if I hadn't seen it about 20 times, the book would just make me sleepy. The film needs to be put on DVD, Blu-ray would be even better. I have a rare VHS copy, but never miss this film on the television machine. This is one time that the film is a lot better than the book that gave birth to it."
1,impossible choice,"I probab;y would like to purchase this CD but you provide absolutely no information on the most imposrtant aspect of the music, whether it is midi, piano or orchestral.I cannot listen on realone as I do not wish to purchase it or give them my credit information. I shall have to look elsewhere in the future for my CDs. SorryDesmond Starr"
2,Skip this book,"I'm an Angelina Jolie fan and had hoped to learn a lot about her by reading this biography. I was seriously disappointed. I didn't learn much, as well as the book was not well written. I felt like half the book was dedicated to reviewing her movies or telling more about the movie plots, which I don't care about. I wanted to learn more about Angelina Jolie as a person, and frankly, this book didn't teach me much. It was a waste of my time to read."
1,Not that great...,"Having read other biographies about Angelina Jolie, this was a yawner! It was badly edited, non specific, non informative and even the information it tried to provide was not correct. If you want a good biography, this is not it."
2,A Sad Look at a Foremost Prophet of the Culture of Death,"This is a sad look at one of the foremost ""prophets"" of what the late John Paul II called ""the Culture of Death.""To say that Kevorkian and his associates fail to appreciate the sanctity of human life would be a dangerous understatement. As recorded by Court TV, Kevorkian, his sister, and his attorney appear to have disdain for the sanctity of human life, as well as for basic honesty.For the Christian, unsolicited pain can be an opportunity to share in Christ's own suffering & a uniting with Him in His redemptive sacrifice, offered in obedience to His father. This certainly does not mean that all suffering/pain must be accepted & that efforts to alleviate suffering/pain should be foregone."
3,Promising theme left unresolved,"This novel has a promising subject/theme - wife gives up her life to completely support husband in his political career. As her only child leaves home and her father dies, she begins to wonder if she has done the right thing, and whether she should go after personal fulfilment. Easy enough to read, but I didn't particularly like the technique of jumping back in time regularly - I kept wanting to ""get on with it"". I also didn't find the ending in any way satisfying - way too many issues had been raised and nothing resolved. Maybe that's the way ""real"" life is, but I'd prefer a little more satisfaction from a novel. However I would consider reading another book by this author - to see if she gets any further in her other work."
5,The Best Rock Ballad Ever!!!!,"Even if you don't know this group, even if you don't speak japanese, even if you don't even like Rock Ballads this album is really worthy.Forever Love is well known in the Visual Rock world. X-Japan, the best Visual Rock Group ever, Forever Love, the best example to proove it.If you where searching for a love ballad to give it to someone special this is the best you can get.Simply, the best."
4,"New Zealand colonial wars film that had its own ""wars"".","This historical drama, set in 1860s New Zealand, focuses on the Whanganui River valleyand an Irish settler's seven year effort in trying to find her son, kidnapped by his Maori grandfather.All this while colonials and Maori are engaged in guerrilla-style warfare. This is probably Vincent Ward'sbest film to date and probably the best Maori themed film yet made. The settings and photographyalone are worth viewing, even though the film is not perfect. I was left with the feeling that some furtherimprovements were needed with editing. But given the many production problems, there may have beensome filming needs that were not fulfilled. Very much worth experiencing."
2,Notorious New Zealand flop,"The troubled production of this film is far more interesting than the end product. Director Vincent Ward was temporarily fired and the cinematographer Alun Bollinger filled in. Star Samantha Morton was ill for much of the time, which accounts for the extensive use of voice-over narration.The action takes place in 19th century New Zealand where Maori (the indigenous people) and the colonial English are engaged in conflict around a river. Director Ward has tried to create an epic in the mold of Herzog's ""river"" films but his terrible script leaves the actors nothing to work with. A notorious flop in New Zealand."
3,Morricone's Definitive Edition,The Definitive Edition of Morricone's soundtrack to Tonino Valerii & Sergio Leone's touching western starring Mario Girotti (AKA Terence Hill) and Henry Fonda.Another great score from Morricone who has some real fun with the themes - pretty much parodying his previous work for other westerns.This cd contains alternate themes from the movie and also material that was rejected from the final cut.
1,The Fluffer,The cover is the best part of the movie. Don't waste your time or money (like I did) on this terrible excuse for a movie.
2,"yeah, GAY porn life -let's not forget","I thought cool, I watch porn and it'd be interesting to see the life behind the scenes (boogie nights, et al.) But this is gay porn, which turns even the non-homophobic OFF. I painfully watched and hoped for a movie but there was little. Yes, I probably couldn't see past my phobia for phalics, but this review only serves to warn others. Not for the Will&Grace crowd either. Sorry."
2,"Has some merit, but utimately dull","A lot less provocative than you might think, this one has some really good stuff going for it. The reality of the gay porn industry, some nice performances, well-made. But - and it's a big one -- I really hate these films that do the gay boy chasing the bad straight boy thing. It seems degrading and after a point in the plot, a little unrealistic. What ruined this film for me was the last half hour. I won't spoil it but it seemed forced, overly dramtic and ultimately a little dumb. Really, porn is porn and Boogie Nights did this 1000 times better. Rent, but I would not buy."
4,Believable acting with a story in a tailspin...,"I was surprised at the overall tone of sadness and depression in this movie. The actors, who very believably played struggling youths growing up in a porn/stripper world, were the highlight of this film. Maybe the script needs more credit for the intentional lack of flair and in the end is VERY believable.This is not a ""feel good"" movie, so don't expect a sense of happiness at the conclusion. After watching a convoluted movie like this and knowing these types of situations DO exist in real life, made me thankful my life is ""simple"" compared to this.This film won't win any Oscars, but it's worth the watch for it's raw production value...4 stars."
2,Just because it's a gay movie doesn't make it a good one!,"Almost boring, but a little moving at moments. Far, far from a good film. Chock full of typical gay coming of age movie cliches. The main character is good, but underwritten. And what's the deal with the female stripper scenes? I love female nudity when it's appropriate (Center of the World), but this was way out of place. Gratuitous. And no male nudity? It's a gay film featuring Gay ""Porn Stars"". Geez! The only enjoyable characters are the photographer and the secretary! They get about 5 mins of screen time. Skip it."
4,The cover guy makes this look like trash.,"Turns out it is interesting, well-acted, has complicated and moving characters, and is really well-done overall. Truly, I was surprised.It's not Oscar-material, but Scott Gurney is a perfect self-centered opportunist who can't get enough of whatever pleases him at the moment. Turns out once in awhile he wants Sean, a young employee in the ""industry"" who can get him ""ready"" to do his ""job."" Sean knows what Scott is about, but can't help himself, and neither can Scott's girlfriend or the producers of the porn Scott ""Mikey"" does.Don't expect torrid sex or a fairy-tale ending, but the story is an authentic look at unrequited love and the depths to which we will go, against all odds, to see if our love can be returned, even by someone who is incapable.It's worth looking at. Recommended."
2,Dont get your hopes high as this movie is not what it seems,Having read a glowing review In Gay Times & Diva of the London Lesbian & Gay Film Festival 2001 I imported the DVD at great cost. The picture quality seems good and there is some good concepts explored in the movie but not developed further. Apart from Gurney the movie is not visually very appealing and leaves a taste of a low class and low budget film. Even more amazing is the fact that movie is about pornstar but there is hardly a spec of frontal nudity shown. For me the movie was disappointing and I doubt if it justifies repeat viewing. I expected better.
1,the worst film i ever saw,"i just recently got hooked up in purchasing film from the net and little did i realize that whats posted as a review of films being sold were nothing but deceit.(not for all)This particular film was over rated and so much was said to entice me to get one and view it. my experience? It was one film not even worthy of being reviewed. There is nothing there to be explained. the story was dumb, the whole film was a disaster. It was as if the film was conceived by a highly intoxicated and drugged writer."
1,Deserves 0 stars,"This was one of the worst movies i think i have seen in a long time.There were no redeeming qualities about any of the characters, no matter how good looking... The plot was really weak, leaving you with a feeling of caring less what happened to any of the characters. If i could get a refund on this movie I would!!!Don"
3,"Worth seeing it, for sure.","Even if it's not one of my favorite gay films ever, I think this is a very interesting film to learn about the movie industry (or probably the gay underground side of it). The two main characters are a visual plus for the movie. I wouldn't buy this movie unless you are very much into some of the topics the movie deals with. I do recommend to rent it at least."
3,Good but not great,The movie starts out really good but I think I could have written a better ending. The movie could have done without the whole murder and flee to Mexico plot. How many fired porn stars go on to kill people and flee the country anyway? They could have ended it by resolving his relationship with his girlfriend or starting a relationship with his fluffer who he apparently also had feelings for since he kissed him. I did highly enjoy the porn scenes in this movie. They were laughable and highly realistic as to what porn movies are actually like. If only this movie had stayed on one path it would have been great. But the twist ending turns it into something it's not.
2,Barely adequate,"Like a lot of gay-themed films, this has a pretty box but leaves a lot to be desired inside. There's actually a good 60-minute story here inside an approx. 90 minute running time, so it's too bad the director didn't edit out all the boring parts and make what is now a 2 star movie into perhaps 3 stars. One entirely boring subpolot involves a girl's pregnancy and I can't for the life of me figure out why it's there. It's pointless and dull. There is some nice acting and some nice visuals of the porn star and the fluffer. Just keep your expectations LOW on this one and you might enjoy it."
5,A Must Have for Racing Junkies,I just got my MC2 steering wheel and its awesome! Its well built and works better than I had hoped. I was able to beat my old racing records within hours of using the wheel.One thing that's not mentioned on this site is the force feedback that the wheel has. It has great centering characteristics and good force feedback. The gas pedals feel like real car pedals.Prospective shoppers should buy this wheel without hesitation. Its really THAT good.
4,MC3 - Not all bad....,"Well, I have bought the wheel for GT3 and was curious about the content and facts of these reviews... I would like to go someway to putting he record straight:1) This wheel is FULLY compatable with GT3, but admittedly is a little fiddley to set up.2) The 'play' in the wheel is controllable and can be altered so you only have to turn it slightly for a responce.The only game I have found the wheel difficult to configure for is Driver. Unfortunately this is more to do with the programming of the game as opposed to the wheel itself due to the lack of controllable options in the game. It will work porperly but without the pedals.The following games I have all work fine (maybe with a little tweaking though).GTGT2GT3TocaToca 2Colin McCrae RallyI hope this helps as it is definately the best wheel I have used upto now...."
4,too bad,"I bought MC2 with GT3 for our family's PS2. The wheel looks and feels great, however, it will not work with gt3 with the gas/brake/shifter controls, the game will only operate in mode (analog) with the wheel itself (not the recomended setting that that allows for use of all the pedals/shifter). Now you can still play gt3 but I found it much easier to control with the standard controls......so the wheel is growing dust in the closet."
2,works...but,"It was great at first everything has fun for forza motorsport 4 but then the throttle broke and now I cant go back to the controller, the throttle will go about a 1/4 of the way but the it stays the same speed no matter how hard u press it down"
1,Do not buy this product!,"Don't buy this wheel for 3 reasons: 1) The one I bought only last 3 weeks. After that, when fully pressing accelerator, I can only get half throttle. Makes my 360 HP cars runs like 100 HP car :(. 2) Their customer support [stinks]. When I asked for help, they can only answer those questions on the FAQ sheet. If you asked question boyond the sheet, they will ignore you (yes, they don't reply your email). 3) Its stick shift doesn't compatible with Grand Tourismo 3. Even with their recomemended fix, you will still have a lot of troubles. I am so tired of dealing with their lousy design and tech support."
1,not good at all,this wheel is good with other racing games but not Gran Turismo 3. how can it not work for that?!?! that game is probably the best seller among all racing games and it doesnt work. it works with need for speed 2 and a lot of other stuff but not GT3!
1,Rampage seat covers,These seat cover were very cheap what I though I was looking for. But I was happy at all. The seat covers may it two trips before the drivers side came apart. I sent them back got new ones. Same thing happened again plus the piece that goes through the seat tore so it was like having a loose blanket setting on the seat. The back seat cover was very tight on the seat really surprised it didn't rip getting it on but it has made it through two summers with a 6 and 10 yr old on them. I didn't expect much but still unhappy with the seat covers.
3,Get what you pay for.,You really get what you pay for here. These seat covers do offer exceptional storage but just do not stay on the seats very well. The material is also prone to ripping if any force at all is applied to the seams. All in all though these seats are still better to sit on than the super hot vinyl on a hot summer day.
4,"Could be even More, Better, Different","3 1/2 Stars, rounded up. I was hoping for the best for this album, as 'Each Eye a Path,' his last release, was disappointing. Aside from the track 'The Show,' most of the album just does not work that well. It simply lacks the vibrancy, energy and color of his previous works. This could be in part because this appears to be a purely Mick album, as no guest musicans are credited (No Jansen, No Torn) All the drum tracks are sampled, and Mick does very little, if any vocals. He definitely has some interesting ideas here, they just don't seem to materialize as they should. Come on Mick, we know you can do better, remember Dalis Car? Remember Titles?"
1,Fabulous Flea Market Decorating,"I bought this book based on the reviews and I can say that I really dislike this book. I could not find one project that had any appeal for me or that gave me any ideas. Over the years, I have purchased an unbelievable number of books from Amazon and this is the only book I have ever bothered to return. It is also the only book I have written a review on. I base most of my purchases on reviews and as this was so disappointing to me I felt I had to express my opinion. I suggest you look at this book either at a bookstore or library before purchasing. In my opinion you would be much better off purchasing Junk Chic, Easy Flea Market Style, or Flea Market Style."
1,stay away from grover,"I have been working in the design field for over 10 years now and I have yet to see a worse ripp off then this author not only are there no directions to her projects, but who would want to engage them selves in anything that turned out so chic and cheesey. I have personally met the author and her family I knew them for quite a while infact and never did I find that she could creatively enhance a project. she has some small skill in putting together junk so it doesn't look so much like junk. butlets face it - it's still junk. not something I would put in my house nor in my clients homes."
5,True Noir,"This is one of the most exciting novels I've read in quite a while. It is ""true noir"" in the sense that the protaganist is part hero, part criminal and part victim. The other characters fit the grnre perfectly and I found the obnoxious reporter a hoot. The plot steamed ahead with twist after twist and didn't go for the Hollywood ending (Thank you, Mr.Blue.)I hate to make comparisons to other authors but this books reads like a James Thompson plot (THE GRIFTERS, AFTER DARK MY SWEET) written by Elmore Leonard.Highly removed."
4,Fun read!,"I really enjoyed this book. The main character is a likable badguy who can't seem to make the right decisions. The story is fast paced, with great characters. The ending is quite surprising as well. Mr. Blue has come out swinging with his debut novel."
4,Great Flick,I enjoyed this movie. I found the story line unusual and the acting was great. This movie had such an effect on me that i had to order it through Amazon because i couldn't find a copy of it any where in Australia !
4,Loved it!,I loved it.Its a cute escape from your self destructiveness story.But my husband hated it... So see it for yourself.
3,Two beautiful people and an average story,"Yasmeen Bleeth and Richard Grieco work beautifully together. They made a great couple. The movie itself has an ok but average storyline. Though, one has seen worse of both (Ultimate deception), so this movie is still one of the finer ones"
2,Not Very Interesting.,"This movie probably could have been much better than it was. It just came across as weak and not that good. The acting is okay, but that's really about it. A movie that seemed to try, but for the most part is forgettable. A lot of the movie was just unclear. Try something else."
3,From The Inside Flap:,"Earth sheltered housing has piqued the curiosity of many prospective homeowners who are interested in saving energy, building with nature to reclain and use land efficiently, reducing house maintenance costs, and providing increased protection against natural and man-made disasters. Because of the relatively recent acceptance of earth sheltered housing as an attractive building alternative, however, little information is available to the nonprofessional who wants to have an earth sheltered house built.This practical book takes you step-by-step through all of the planning, design, and construction stages of an earth sheltered house. You'll find detailed explanations of everything from deciding if earth sheltering is right for you through obtaining final inspection approvals. In addition, dozens of do-it-yourself projects will help you to participate in the design and building of your home."
1,I don't get it........,"I was expecting more from this record. I don't get where it's going, it seems to go in many directions with fluffy vocals and synthy ballomingo-ripoffish melodies but it comes up short.After a few listens the over produced studio armchair musicianship does not impress. Sorry. No need to hear wallpaper dance music, i have bands like yanni and john tesh for that."
1,Over rated nonsense!,"This cd from top to bottom is annoyingly plain and remarkabley lacking in substance. I understand the concept, but it is not made clear throughout the cd .I would boil it down to ill-experienced newcomers or poor song arrangement Some songs are a hit, most are a miss. Suffice to say, the cd is a big let down especially for those who know a thing or two about music and the industry."
4,Seek no more,"Sleepthief's CD is an ethereal mixture of downtempo electronica awash in lovely female vocals.The lone exception is the captivating cover of Berlin's ""The Metro"" that will have you gyrating eagerly to its blissful beats.If you enjoy Sleepthief I would highly recommend any CD by Delerium, as well as BENEATH THE SURFACE by Balligmingo."
2,Disappointingly boring,"I tried very hard to like this album because I like some of the artists involved, but the songs are too alike and, thus, the album is unfortunately quite boring. No song stands out for its musicality or its lyrics. The monotony is disappointing."
2,"Sorry, this didn't work.","I love almost all of the artists involved in this project. HOWEVER, this sounded so over produced it utterly lacked the creativity that these musicians and vocalist have brought to all their earlier work. It is OK but seems very mainstream targeted. I found myself bored with each track before it even got halfway through. I will try listening again, I really wanted to be knocked out by this but was underwhelmed. If you liked this, and are curious to hear something similar but more experimental try some of the other work such as Mind Fruit or Delirium's earlier stuff, and you may see what I mean."
4,A Very Delightful Book!!!!!,"I loved this book. Finally a heroine that didn't instantly forgive the hero as soon as he said he was wrong. She had him prove that he truly had changed and that his love no longer came with restrictions.I highly recommended this book for anyone who would like to read something that is highly entertaining and romantic. The only reason why I gave it four stars (instead of five), was the fact that it almost started to get boring about 3/4 of the way. But once I got over that hurdle, the book was well worth it.Read this book! The begining was fun and the ending will never disappoint you!"
5,raised with an animal from Everon,"Jef has been raised with an animal from Everon, a planet that has been newly settled. The animal has not grown as they are known to on their home world, so he is taking it home see if it grows or what, on his native world. It is a scarey beast as far as most folks from the world are concerned, but with Jef, it is docile and obiedant. When he gets to the planet he starts off with the authorities wanting to quarantee or kill it. He is assisted by some fellow he met on the ride out, so at least he and his pet get to stay together.Jef gets into trouble, gets to know the people and societies of the planet. There is some psychic connection between Jef and his pet that grows stronger as his pet grows as well. In the end the connection has grown so strong, Jef is able to see from the eyes of others not his pet.The delimna that it turns out Jef is to solve was presented by the animals of the planet and is a trial, of sorts, of the human race."
3,Pencap,"The reason i purchased these pencap/stylus thingers was A.) so i could have an extra styli around, and B.) to replace the pencaps that i lose ever so constantly. But i guess it was somewhat my fault for buying these, for within a week or purchase, i found myself purchasing a new set of four. I lost them just like regular pencaps. I think the handspring pen/styli is a much better way to go. It fits into the visor, and is much easier to keep track of."
4,Pretty handy,"Nice to have about in an emergency. Converts nearly any pen or pencil into a tol for your PDA. Nice bonus, they glow in the dark (pretty brightly too)."
5,A must-read for anyone interested in Classical Tibetan.,It's not a typical grammar text. It won't give you prescriptive rules and exercises and it doesn't try to force Tibetan into procrustean bed of grammatical categories of European languages. Instead it aims at helping the reader to develop an intuition about the language and is very successful at that. Abundant examples with clear and thorough explanations lead you through all aspects of the Classical Tibetan from alphabet to poetry. This book will definitely help you crystallize your understanding of Tibetan grammar.
3,Work and Life Unbalanced,"Why do women set unrealistic expectations on themselves? I'm a working mom, so could relate to a lot of this book, especially a small vignette about the challenges of being completely engorged with no time or place to pump. However, I found myself unsympathetic to Kate. While she was strong in her work life, she seemed completely cowed in her home life. She seemed more concerned with creating a perfect package, such as distressing a pie crust to give the appropriate homemade look, then with the core role of motherhood. The moments were I most empathized were the times when she finally turned her harried focus to her kids. The end was very unsatisfying, since it seemed too tidily, happily ever after."
2,How does she do it? She doesn't!,"I too was drawn in by the editorial reviews of this book being touted as the working mother's Bridgette Jones's diary. I can only guess the reviews were written by men. While I could relate to the guilt felt by our heroine I couldn't help but want to knock her silly. A job that affords her Armani suits and a nanny? Poor lady. Try mothering in the real world. This book is a complete insult to those of us who have to deal with work, kids, an executive position and DON'T have a choice. All my working friends could't wait to read this. I will make sure they don't.How does she make it in a man's world? Ultimately, according to Allison Pearson, she doesn't.Spend the {money} on a manicure, you'll feel much better in the end."
2,I Don't Know Why She Did It!!,"I listened to friends tell me how hilarious this book was so I kept reading, hoping something interesting would happen, something at least REAL! I'm supposed to muster up sympathy for this supposedly brilliant woman who is a shark in the world of business but at home is afraid of her nanny and her housekeeper? It all seemed so absolutely silly and inane! And what was so funny about the high-school highjinks this crowd of female corporate geniuses pulled on the their co-worker after he put up nude composites of a fellow female work-mate on the internet? This was the best they could come up with?? Are you telling me you have to destroy your own career in order to get even? You know what it reminded me of? That movie ""9 to 5"" with Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda. Without the charm."
2,It stressed me out,This book stressed me out..... I spend most of the time hoping she would get her act together so she (and I) could relax. As a working mom it depressed me... and I truly could not relate to her.
3,"Good beginning, but the middle and ending okay","Kate Reddy is a woman going to a hundred different directions at the same time. She is trying to be a mother, wife, employee, and a friend alll at the same time and she is failing them all. So starts her journey to see what is more important to Kate and what she might have to give to have it all.This is the first book by Allison Pearson and after seeing her on the ""Today Show"" when the book first came out I couldn't wait to read it. The beginning was good, but I found the ending to be a neat. Ms. Pearson seem wrap up the story just a little too well. But for a plane ride or a day at the beach this book will do nicely."
4,I Don't Know How She Does It,"I liked this book, although I did expect a funnier, more Bridget-Jones type of book from all the rave reviews it has received... I think this book is something any mother can relate to -working or not. It really is about the struggle between being a good mother & trying to balance out every aspect of your life. Worth reading."
4,Loved every second until the very end,"Don't worry -- I won't give away the ending. I will say that I loved this book. Raved about it. Bookmarked quote after quote. I empathized with literally every single experience of the main character. I felt more in touch with a heroine than I have in a long, long time. Maybe since ""Bridget Jones Diary"", and even then, frankly, I just loved her but wasn't really simpatico with her. Here, Kate Reddy is me. Almost literally.And that's probably why I was a teeny bit put off by the end of the book. I won't say more because I don't want to ruin it for other readers. And I will buy more books by this author. I loved her insights, her humor, her gut-wrenching honesty. I just didn't love the way she ended this amazing story. Maybe that's because it can't be my ending?In any case, well, well worth the read. You will enjoy every page."
5,A Hillarious Must-Read,"I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT is a hillarious, must-read book for women of all ages, married or single. I related to all of it, even though I'm single. And I felt like I was listening to my married friends sharing their stories of juggling the kids and work and shouldering the burdens of domestic responsibilities while their significant others sail through life without a clue! The office dynamics between men and women in the workplace are so on targeet too! If Allison Pearson wasn't so funny, you might cry at the inequities Kate Reddy suffers both at home and in the workplace because they are all too real.I'm keeping this review short and sweet since I read the book in 3 days 3 months ago. Suffice it to say that if you liked Bridget Jones Diary (and how could you not?), or The Nanny Diaries, you will love this book. Your health will improve too, and general state of mind because you can't help reading it without laughing out loud."
1,"trite, myth-propagating, unbelievable","It's difficult to not give anything away about the book in order to back up the criticisms in the review title, but the character read as someone that couldn't possibly exist in the real world. A collection of stereotypes: the high-powered career-woman and the stay-at-home-mom, smashed impossibly together."
2,I Don&#65533;t Know How I Finished It,"This book is better birth control than an afternoon at the Park Slope Food Coop (habitat of the undisciplined bobo brat). The endless hassles and humiliations that make up Kate Reddy's days juggling high-powered career, kids and husband gave me a case of heartburn and elevated blood pressure just from turning the pages. Pearson's zany plot twists verge on sadism, even if the character's decision to sell her soul so completely for cash renders her unsympathetic from the start. For a certain tiny, VERY privileged slice of society, the horrors of Kate's life may approach reality. But, like hemorrhoids or cockroach mating habits, are such mundane yet unpleasant subjects worth reading about if they're not rendered by a master? This is only middling work, and I can't imagine a harried mother would want to spend her free time reliving the worst moments of her life. Quick, someone, tie my tubes!"
3,PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE,"IF ANYONE HAS AN IDEA ABOUT WHICH RAVEL PIECE IS DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK""A BIRD FLOATING OVER THE WATER "" (NOT QUITE SURE IF THAT IS EXACT QUOTE) PLEASE LET ME KNOW, I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT MYSELF!I HAVE TO ADD ANOTHER ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN CHARACTER.....IN MY HUMBLE OPINION, IF SHE WAS A STAY AT HOME MOM, SHE WOULD BE JUST AS HARD ON HERSELF IF SOMETHING WASNT 'PERFECT'....THE BOOK WAS FULL OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PROVE THEMSELVES TO SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE. THE HUSBAND HAD THE RIGHT IDEA WITH HIS RELAXED ATTITUDE, AND HIS ADVICE TO HER TO ""LET GO"". NOTHING, ANYWHERE, IS PERFECT.ALL IN ALL, I ENJOYED HER WRITING, EVEN THOUGH THE CHARACTERS WERE HARD TO LIKE, AND WOULD READ MORE OF HER WORK."
2,I Was Disappointed!!!,"I read this book because of the kids, unfortunately there wasn't enough about the kids to make it worth my while.A woman is torn between her job and her kids. She finds joy from both. In my opinion, there is no question about this. I feel the parent should stay with the children, especially while the children are young. It not only benefits the child, but also the adult.I had a difficult time getting through this book,mainly because the sentences were jammed too full, trying to prove that this woman was too busy. It didn't seem realistic.I gave this book a 2 and a half stars:)"
2,Unsettling,"Ultimately this is the story of the poor rich successful girl (yes, I realize she wasn't born rich) that popped two kids out and didn't realize they instantly came with a nanny. She's a control freak who can't control anything. NOT impressed and very glad I got it from the library."
1,Pass,"Don't buy this book. Not only is it poorly written, but I can watch the news to have mainstream culture demonize me and other women. I also was completly offended with the cushy background of the author and her purported tone that she spoke for so many women. Please!"
2,Exhausting,"I was absolutely exhausted reading this book! I have been a work-outside-of-the-home mother, a stay-at-home mother, and a part-time-at-home mother. A lot of what Kate Reddy goes through is true to life, but this book was just too much! I didn't care about her childhood, and I thought the degree to which Kate/the author patronized and infantilized men was just ridiculous. Kate Reddy did not have my sympathy one bit. She deserved to feel guilty and exhausted."
2,I Do Know How She Does It,"Any working mother--or, to be more precise, any mother who has a job outside the home--can identify with Kate Reddy, a woman who seems to have it all (a great job, a good marriage, and two beautiful, healthy children) and constantly hears the sound of balls crashing while she attempts to balance the demands of her seemingly-perfect life.Allison Pearson's portrayal of Kate is realistic and, for the most part, engaging. But I hated the end of the novel. Millions of women around the world manage--albeit with difficulty and great sacrifices--to balance marriage, children and career. Allison Pearson does. I do. So do many of my girlfriends. Why can't Kate Reddy do it too?"
3,Feel good movie from Amazon,"I happen to love all movies Pierce Brosnan is in & loved watching him interact with Sara Jessica Parker who was wonderful with Greg Kinnear another winner in my book. The movie just made me feel sorry for her little girl who missed her mommy but mommy vindicated herself at the end. Very enjoyable. Pierce, as usual, did a crackerjack job. The seller, through Amazon , is very professional & I would go through him again. The video arrived a day early. thanks."
2,Not worth the hype,"This book was irritating. I did not sympathize with the main character, Kate, at all.It could be a terrific book from the working mother's point of view but unfortunately it is not. It stays on the surface with not much substance.Kate has a great, very demanding, high salary finance job.She has two children.And a nanny.And a loving, understanding husband who's career hasn't been as successful as Kate's yet and he spends a lot of time with the children.Sure, she works hard and she juggles a lot of things, like school bake sales and dinner with the in-laws.But still, she got no sympathy from me. Maybe because I know to many hard working mothers, with two jobs, no loving husbands and no nanny that juggle a lot more than Kate.It has a happy ending, but if you think of it Kate's life isn't that bad at all to begin with.I didn't not understand the point of this book. My suggestion is to skip it."
4,"Exaggerated, but still hits the mark!","This is an exaggerated story about the life of a working mom, but the exaggeration only made it funny. Allison Pearson's assessment of how professional women who also choose to be mothers are viewed by male coworkers hits the nail on the head! Pearson's witty writing made this book a joy to read, although I did find the ending rushed.Hope there will be a sequel!"
5,fantastic!,"I am going to be so disappointed when this story ends. This is a fabulous book by a brilliant new writer. I just logged on toAmazon to buy every book that this woman has written and was shocked to find that this is her first. Also, I listened to this book on cd and the reader Emma Fielding is great. I'm always so relieved when a professional is hired to read. Some great books are delivered very poorly when read by the author."
1,I threw out my copy so nobody else would read it!,"I am a mother of two and work outside of the home full-time. I bought this book because I was feeling overwhelmed and was looking for a book to help me commiserate over my situation. I couldn't have hated this book more. I was so mad at the author for the ending, after cursing and crying, I threw the book in the trash so that no other working Mom would be fooled into reading a book. And now they are making it into a book? Let's hope they change the ending."
3,I Just Didn't Like Her,"Yes, the book is humorous. Yes, the writing is, for the most part, intelligent. But Kate Reddy is just plain impossible to love (or even like). She is whiny, selfish, critical, and prone to martyrdom. I expected the heroine to be one I related to. Instead, I just wanted to slap her."
2,No No No! A terrible meta-message!,"Pearson is a talented writer who does weave very funny tidbits into her work, but at its core this is a terrible book that sends all the wrong messages about working mothers. Our protagonist is a woman who is miserable to her husband, contemplates an affair, barely spends time with her children and when she does, is short with them. And the end leaves the reader with the message that the only way to salvage your marriage and get to know your children is to quit your job - how awful!I'm a working mom with young twin daughters, and I did NOT see myself in this book. I was so disappointed - from everything I'd heard it was supposed to be this breakthrough novel that wittily and heartbreakingly depicted the life of your typical working mom. Not so. A step backwards into one-dimensional stereotypes, I think."
5,Cross between Briget Jones and Nanny Diaries,"Wow, this first novel is a goodie, written in diary-like first person narrative of Kate, mother of two living the good life and struggling to hold it all together: perfect kids, perfect job, perfect house, perfect marriage. She wants all that she has, wants still more, and knows the price on marriage, family, and self. But instead of being a downer, it's all told with high intelligence and humor, many laugh-aloud moments and some touching ones, and, for good measure, the men are often pretty good guys instead of insensitive cads.Even if you think you ought to be turned off by this book, even if it sounds like a light fluffy beach read, well, read it anyway. You'll be delightfully surprised."
4,how under-appreciated are working mothers? Now you know!,"This book is the best I've read with regard to describing the frustrations of being a working mother. Although my job (and probably the jobs of most of the readers of this book, or else they wouldn't have the time to be reading novels!!!) is nowhere near fast-paced, high-flying and competitive as Kate Reddy's, the feeling that you're on a constant treadmill set too fast is all too familiar.Allison Pearson tackles her subject with great honesty and a wonderful sense of humour and though I really enjoyed the book, I got a feeling that she kind of ""sells out"" the working mothers of the world in the end. Yes, I KNOW from bitter experience that we can't have it all, but does that mean we have to give up trying?"
3,Funny but disappointed with the ending,Loved some of the one liners but ultimately felt betrayed with the ending (which I wont give away!) She definitely captures the chaos of trying to do it all and the strain of young kids on a marriage. Some of the relationships with co-workers (especially when hatching their scheme) in the book are a stretch also. Good for some laughs but wait until it is available in paperback to save some $$.
2,It gives me a slight headache,"I'm currently reading this book, and my head is pounding. I had to put it down for a moment to catch my bearings. It's not that it's a bad book, it's just extremely fast-paced and is tiring me out."
2,I Was Disappointed!!!,"Of course, the kids drew me to this book, but therereally wasn't enough of the kids to satisfy me.The story never really got me involved. It's like the author tried to cram too much into each sentence to exhaust the reader, and prove that the main character was too busy. It is my personal belief that women should stay with their kids. It not only benefits the kids, but also the parents. It's just too bad that practically the whole book went by before she realized this.I would have rather read about a stay at home momwho struggled, but took great care of her children. This is the first book I have read by this author, and now I'll be scared to read others by her. I rated I Don't Know How She Does It a 2.5 stars:)"
4,"It's just a story, for goodness sake!","Enjoyable from start to finish.Why are so many reviewers in an uproar? It's just a novel, not a manifesto on the working woman. Incidentally, there is no ""muffia"" - women who are at home full-time with their kids don't begrudge or feel superior to women who work."
3,Interesting and Hurried,The author really gets you involved with the Kate's hurried atmosphere. It is definitely funny and very fast paced.
5,"""I Don't Know How She Does It""","I don't have children, but even I found myself laughing out loud. Couldn't put it down! A gem!"
4,"Far-fethched, But Fun to Read","Kate Reddy (the protagonist) was a little hard for me, a working mom, to identify with because with a full-time nanny, a housekeeper and a chronically helpful husband, her whining was a little far-fetched. Having said that, despite this minor annoyance I really couldn't put this book down and was sorry when I finished it. I was fun to read, and I can only hope that my newly purchased ""Babyville"" will be as captivating."
4,For every mom who's gone into a meeting with spit-up on her suit jacket,"When I went back to work after the birth of my first child, I read a lot of these working-mom-makes-good books. You know, the ones that set out to show you that you're not the only one to show up at a client meeting with a spit-up stain on her suit jacket, or to have bags under the bags under her eyes from trying to juggle home and a career. In my opinion, though, this is the best of the bunch.I Don't Know How She Does It hit home for me because the heroine shares my industry (public relations/advertising). The novel is set in England so some of the language and pop culture references are a little off, but its a great story of a mom finding herself without losing herself.Plus, it's hysterical. Highly recommended for any mom who gnashes her teeth when some well meaning person asks her just how she does it..."
3,Entertaining to a degree,"This book is entertaining, although I'm not entirely sure what the point of the book is.Without giving away the ending, I'll just say that what it seems to be saying in the beginning, loses all steam at the end, leaving the reader wondering what the point was.I am a working mom, and my first reaction to the book was ""Wow, I shouldn't feel so bad about my shortcuts!"" I felt an empathy, and a sisterhood with the lead character. But eventually her incredible selfishness took that over, and I didn't overly like her.The story is witty, but not ""laugh out loud"" witty. I smiled a few times."
2,Ugh! Enough already!,"Being a working mom, I don't have much time to read so I got the audio version of ""I don't know how she does it."" And I don't - I really don't - know how anyone got all the way through this book. Sure, Pearson makes some solid points about the delicate balance between work and home life and the jumble it can all be, but her character comes across as crass and uncaring about the people she should care about most: her family. I finally gave up on the audio version when I couldn't listen to another moment of Kate's complaints. She's all complaints, no solutions and she seems to be the only one who matters. Her selfishness was appalling. Thank god I only rented this from the library!"
2,ANNOYING,"This is a moderately amusing, fairly entertaining quick read. Most working mothers will be able to relate to something that Kate experiences, in the same way that most single women could relate to something that Bridget Jones experienced, while recognizing that these women are really caricatures, not real women.HOWEVER, this book was mostly annoying! There's virtually no character growth until the last 20 pages, and by then you really don't care. The book stopped being amusing and started being really annoying pretty early on. You just want Kate to STOP COMPLAINING and find some beauty in the big pay check, big house, great kids, etc..."
1,Pain in the Neck,"I wnated to like this book so much- a working woman, balancing motherhood with a rewarding career, blah, blah, blah. But Kate Reddy was just so unlikeable. Not funny at all, in fact, just depressing and whiney. ugh, those stupid lists of stuff on her to do list were painful. My advice- stick to Bridget Jones- at least she has a sense of humor!"
4,A woman with more than 2 hands!,"Katy Reddy defines the working mother in today's world! Being a working mother myself, this book was hard to escape with in the beginning. After a day at the stressful office and then coming home to read the first two chapters, I felt so overwhelmed with Katy's e-mails & to-do lists I could only stop to create my own to-do list's and respond to my own very full e-mail in-box. However, I continued on and after getting to know this working mother a little more, I learned to feel relaxed while reading, regardless of all of the stress that Katy was experiencing. I also found the British humor hilarious and found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. I think this book proves that it's near impossible to have it all. Thanks to a friend for purchasing this great gift for my BIRTHDAY!"
1,Started off good...,"I thought I would enjoy this book. And I did at first. However, I started to hate it after a while, finding it extremely depressing. We follow the life of Kate Reddy, a working mom with a marriage that is on the rocks, and who is finding herself drawn to another man...who lives across the Atlantic. I found most of Kate's life boring, especially the bits about her job because I had no idea what Kate's job was. Perhaps I'm a bit to young to try and understand exactly what Allison Pearson was trying to say about working mothers. However, to me, it was like she was saying it couldn't be done if you wanted to be great in both arenas."
2,"Funny book, but has its drawbacks...","I am in the middle of this book, and while I like the narrator's (Kate's) wry wit, the book does have its problems. She does only seem to be aware of herself and her world. She makes a lot of money and also has to work hard, I understand, but other women (like my own mother)work just as hard, in careers that are considered ""boring"" and don't have the perks (like travel)that her job does. They also have to deal with the same issues she does- a husband who doesn't know how to do things without her, doesn't start dinner, etc. I am glad other women do have these things, but sometimes this book just seemed like a love story to thoise with glamourous careers and children. Someone should try writing a story about a mom who has to work 3 jobs and deal with her family. This character just needs to get her head out of the sand a bit."
3,Hard Character To Sympathize With,"While Pearson does a remarkable job of describing the nearly impossible juggling act that is required of working mothers, I wish she had created a character that I could sympathize with. I couldn't stand Kate Reddy. She was horrible to her husband, condescending to her co-workers, and short-tempered with her children. When she began her email adultery, I absolutely couldn't stand her anymore. I just kept thinking that the whole family would be better off without her.As a single mother myself, I was thrilled to see such a talented author illustrate the complexity of managing career and family--- except that Kate didn't really manager her family. Instead, she criticized the way her husband and nanny did things. By the time the novel ended, I didn't care what Kate did. I just felt sorry for everyone who had to live with her."
1,Really depressing - I don't know why she did it!,"I'm a lawyer and a mom, and while I sometimes related to Kate's frustration with time and with her kids, I found the book incredibily depressing. I was literally SAD much of the time I spent reading this supposedly ""hysterical"" book - and angered by the fact that the reviewers were calling it the ""most honest book about modern motherhood"" - this is not a true book about modern motherhood - if it were we would all slit our own wrists. I agree with the reviewer that called this a backlash against working mothers - it really seems to imply that a working mom cannot possibly be happy. Don't waste your precious time or money on this one."
3,"""Nanny Diaries"" flipside","Kate Reddy seems to be Mrs. X from The Nanny Diaries. The longer I read the book, the more I felt that she made these choices herself, and hundreds of thousand of moms across the world struggle to do what she does, but without the help of a maid or a nanny. I did enjoy the details and the metaphors throughout the book, and it held my attention all the way through, but I have very little sympathy for Mrs. X, uh, I mean Kate."
1,disappointed,Sorry I spent good money on this book. From the reviews I thought it would be a funny take on typical working Mom.. I think the author more interested in showing her grasp of the English language ..... I planned to read it and buy some for gifts. Glad I reviewed it first.
1,What a Whiner!,"This woman has a partner, a nanny, and a well - paid job that gives her international travel (sans child) as a perk. So - WHAT IS SHE WHINING ABOUT??? If you are a single mother like me, you'll find this book not only annoying, but insulting. This woman needs to get some perspective on how hard it really can be, to parent a child."
2,Frustrating,"As a new mother, I had looked forward to this book, thinking it would give me insight regarding how to balance work and motherhood. Instead, the main character spends most of her time complaining about having too much work, yet hating spending vacation time with her kids (who drive her crazy.) The end was far fetched too. I would not recommend this books for new mothers."
4,Good Read!,I enjoyed this book a lot. I really felt like this woman was living my life in England. It really made me see how much I do. I found myself wanting her to hook up with the American man just one time for the fun of it. Mainly because I knew I never would so I wanted to have her live it for me. It is really a good read. Enjoy!
1,success of this propaganda is inexplicable,"For starters, Helen Fielding did it better (the brit-breezy funny diary) in Bridget Jones. But what makes me and other women want to throw this book across the room (that's how I wound up reading it, I caught it on an enraged flyover in my office and needed something cheesy to read on the subway home) is the over-the-top setup that would be satirical if Ms. Pearson didn't keep bringing in the violins (heroine's sad childhood) and, the predictability of an ending that would make Phyllis Shlafly pround. Working woman, thou cannot mother! Ms. Pearson tells us. I thought this was a hateful little piece of tripe. Don't know how it got such kindly reviews."
3,Slightly boring,"I've enjoyed similar (ie style) easy reads such as Animal Husbandry, Bridget Jones, etc., but honestly I was a little bored with this one. I chuckled at parts, but I actually skimmed the last 10 pages just to get it over with."
2,We All Know How She Does It --- Yawn,"It all seemed so everyday, a bit trite and neither so horrid or so glorious to make me feel that I was reading anything other than a woman's magazine take on things. A bit much ""poor me"". Unlikely and pat ending, the type available to only to those who really do have pretty much everything.If you want the real, real picture .. sharp, human, true and although the humour is dry and a touch cynical,also funny, .. take a walk back in time to Fay Weldon writing decades ago, but still ringing true for this age. Try out a copy of Watching Me, Watching You,(stories and the novella""The Fat Women's Joke"") and I guarantee you will be excited by the writing and teased by her unsentimental perceptions."
5,Funny and real,Laugh out loud funny. Stab in the heart real.Any working mom will see herself -- both the parts she loves and the parts she secretly hates.
3,Hmmm...,"My mother bought this book for me and although I don't have any children, I thought that it might be worth a read since it was hyped as such a best-seller. In the end, I thought it wasn't bad - certainly there was really never a dull moment - but the characters aren't believable enough, and it's actually really stressful to read!! You find yourself being strung out on the daily panic of the main character as she struggles to be all things to all people, letting her family fall apart while ignoring the obvious choice which only she can make - to chill out!!Entertaining enough, but definitely not a way to unwind at the end of the day!"
4,"Great, great, fun, apart from the ending","The ending of the book is disappointing, politically and otherwise. Pearson navigates the story's tensions so brilliantly through most of the book but at the end they seem to back her into a corner. Still, the rest of the book is SO funny, and the lead character's voice is SO likable."
5,Couldn't put it down- I was laughing out loud...,This book was so funny and sincere. I loved it. It's a great book for any new mom who has struggled with the feminist obligation of achieving success and breaking through that glass ceiling... I can't wait for Allison Pearson's next book!
3,Laugh-out-loud entertaining!,"Although sometimes hard to sympathize with Kate Reddy, still a fun read and probably too true to life for many. Very funny moments in this one! Will definitely look up any additional offerings from this author."
5,Allison stepped into my head.,"This book had me hooked by the first 3 pages. The character hits on many of my thoughts and concerns. There were situations and places I would never go, but those situations added drama and left me guessing which way Kate, the main character, was going to go. I recommended it to my female friends and I recommend it to you."
2,More career mom guilt,"This is just another knock-off in the post-Bridget Jones female heroine genre. Except there's too much to not like among the main characters to make them sympathetic or even memorable. Must every novel produced in England include those clever little emails meant to provide character insight? While there were a few laughs, this was a disappointment. I feel like I've read it before. A few times. Enough. You do know how she does it. The real question is, do you care?"
3,Attempts to relate,"I found myself to be very unsympathetic towards Kate, she wasn't a likable person in my eyes. I did relate to her as a working mother minus the nanny and the housekeeper though. I feel like this book was simply comic relief toward the over dramatic life I possibly live. It didn't show me anything new but I was entertained at times."
2,I do it - but without the nanny or housekeeper!,"This book is light-hearted in its attempt to relate the story of a working mother. Unfortunately the working mother, at the centre of the story, is not a true reflection of the majority of working mums. The conflict she feels is probably very familiar to most mothers, but it is a bit indulgent and certainly not the great read I was expecting."
4,A Quick Read,"Having heard so much hype about this book, I had to buy it and check it out for myself. I could immediately relate to the heroine, Kate, and overall, thought the story was a good one, if a bit on the ""lite"" side. I did enjoy the story though, and thought the plot twists were funny and surprising."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I ordered the VCR from Amazon.com on Tuesday afternoon, and it arrived on Friday morning. While the unit doesn't seem as sturdy or solid as higher-end units, we've been very pleased. This thing's got about 1,000 features I'll never get around to using. We did try programming the timing for recording, and the proceedure was straightforward and simple. The best thing about this VCR? A price we just couldn't beat."
4,Excellent for its price,"This VCR has everything you need to play and record videos. It has helpful features like a jog/shuttle on the remote, time and index searches, and reasonably easy programming. My only complaints are that it's a little harder to learn than most (but once you have it figured out, it's good), and the motor is a little loud when rewinding/fastforwarding."
3,just an average vcr,"I expected more. Minuses: The Jog/Shuttle dial doesn't work that smoothly. The front panel display is small and only displays the time. The remote is large (hard to hold in one hand) and the buttons are small and confusing. Record programming is non-intuitive and frustrating. One-touch-record and tracking controls are not on the remote (the buttons are on front of the VCR) Plusses: Reverse slow motion (thru Jog/Shuttle) Other features (such as universal remote, front A/V inputs, index and time search, and high-speed rewind) are fairly standard now days. Overall it's just average."
1,PAIN!!!,"I bought this VCR for my girlfriend for x-mas it has been the biggest pain ...i have ever had. The first one ate VCR tapes, take that one in get another and this one won't record the TV. While trying to get ahold of someone from this company is almost impossible. There is a lesson that i haved learned from this whole mess. Which would be that ya i saved about 40 bucks, but in the end i sure ended up paying alot more."
2,very cheap!,"Very cheaply made the sound quality is a nightmare, I'm very glad I bought it used for less than $3 I would have been furious if I would have paid full price which the $20 tag is outrageous, the one good thing I have to say is the bass lines are fantastic if you can hear past an awful sound quality and appreciate a fantastic bass player this is for you."
1,"""B"" movie script sold as a novel","This book is a painful read. I couldn't even finish it. The author lists several scripts to his credit, and this must have been one no one would buy. The narrative is very stilted, the characters are one dimensional and their ""lines"" are so lame as to be funny. This story reads like something the Sci-Fi channel might have produced in their early years before they had money and viewers. Even the book font is blocky and clunky - just like the story!"
5,Galactic Combat,"If you like the David Webber series or Star Wars, Star Trek you will like Galactic Combat! Excellent characters, fantastic story of a star ststem at war. The Zadens are the new bad guys you'll love to hate. Its a good read which you do not want to put down! Rich and detailed battle scenes that heep you turning the pages. The story of an alien war happening in the Reticulum star system is cool idea for everyone who knows Earths UFO history."
5,Childhood Revisited...,"I found this particular book in the library at school when I was in Junior High (7th Grade). I was a freshman and a somewhat hip bookworm/closet nerd and I absolutely loved poetry, especially creepy, weird, silly poetry and short stories by people like Edgar Allen Poe and Lewis Carol (wrote Alice In Wonderland) . I fell in love with this book and memorized every poem in it and found out that there were other ""weird"" kids just like me that loved them also. The other students called them nerds but I called them friends. I decided to try and find a copy of it several years ago because I still love poetry and although I had forgotten most of these poems I never forgot the joy of reading and memorizing them and of finding out that it was ok to be who I was and to like who or what I liked not matter what anyone else thought."
2,Way Over Priced,"This product, while not sold as a kit, can be had at the Apple store for $127.00. Cable kit $49, Docking Station $49, Charger $29.Caveat Emptor -"
2,Old out dated apple dock,"So I have an I phone 4 and the only thing I can use this for is to charge my phone, other then that it does nothing. I went to my local apple store and they told me unless you have a iPod from before 2005 it's almost useless I was under the impression that it was compatable with my phone based on listing but it was not."
1,PRICE INCREASED BY $30 IN A MONTH!!,"This is a great product for its normal price of $99.00, not $139.00!! The Apple store still sells it for $99.00!! They sell it separately, the A/V cable with the charging unit $49.00, then the remote kit $49.00!! I have purchased several from Amazon for the correct price of $99.00!! Hopefully this price will be corrected soon!!"
1,Easy Glide...that's for sure!,When it says glide....it means glide. Very strange and could not get used to it. I don't need the gel wrist to glide and I just took the mouse pad out of the rest and using that. Disappointed.
2,Great concept but not so friendly,I purchased this assuming it would be a bit more fluid in movement. I do not think it really works with your natural body flow or assits as I hoped with reducing wrist strain due to heavy mouse use.Product is stable and otherwise comfortable but use is not relaxing IMHO.
5,Wow!,"What a great Broadway CD! I thought it was great. I myself have been in three Broadway productions in NYC. I thought this CD captured some of Broadway's greatest and most cherished songs. I was in Chicago, Guy's and Dolls, and My Fair Lady. This is a really good quality disc and a smash hit. This is one you really should add to your collection. I showed it to alot of my friends and they were all very impressed. Thanks!"
5,Plenty of Multiplicity,"The Art Spiegelman contribution to this book is in comic book form, pp. 165-8. In tips on telling jokes, a current obsession with people who would like to be popular, but a plague for those people who think that they already are popular, Art illustrates a joke: ""This guy think's he's a mirror so he goes to see a shrink."" I'm not going to tell you the results. That would be too much like trying to read Mad magazine to my mother while she was ironing. Mark Twain was the guy who could be funnier, if Art quoted him right. ""Everything human is pathetic."" (p. 168)"
5,The greatest headphones ever made,"I bought my first pair of these in 1988 and am still using them. I am so paranoid that one day Sony will cease their production I've purchased several pairs so I'll have them up until I die. It's a testament to their quality that sports broadcasters, music producers, djs, and other professionals needing optimum sound quality continue to use these. What impresses me the most is the bass reproduction and high end timbres. I'm telling you, many years ago when Sony would roll out new models of headphones I would spend 2 to 3 times as much as this pair, thinking that the quality would be a step up. That was NEVER the case. These headphones have stood the test of time and I cannot recommend them highly enough. They are durable, and reproduce voice, music, ANYTHING with a clarity that is unrivaled."
5,the best cans you can get for a hundred bucks,"I've tried quite a number of headphones in the $75 to $150 price range and these are hands down the best. Extremely comfortable, great natural sound, rock solid contstruction, and they're flat enough you can sleep with them on.I can't say how they compare with the very top end Grado's or Senn's, but for the price they can't be beat. They can't quite keep up with some of the $500 in-canal earbuds out there, but they're significantly better headphones than the comparibly priced KOSS or Sennheiser models (the UR-35 and HD-570).Sure, they're are other headphones out there, but for general purpose use (listening to the beatles on your iPod) these cans are pretty much perfect. And you gotta love the retro-80s style."
4,Very nice headphones,"I needed a pair of headphones to listen to some music that I am creating on my computer. I didn't want to spend $200+ for Bose or Beats headphones, so I started reading reviews of more reasonably priced products. I wanted headphones that covered my ears and didn't merely rest on them. These Sony headphones were priced well and were reviewed well. One persistent complaint seemed to be that they were uncomfortable. I don't even have that complaint. I find them to be very comfortable on my head and they sound great! For a pair of accurate, low-priced headphes, I don't see how you can do better than these Sony MDR-V6 headphones."
4,A bit shrill,The high end leaves something to be desired and the bottom is a tad boomy. But for the price? Not too shabby.
4,Very nice,"Extended frequency response for harmonics, thus sound is crystal clear. Also bass response is excellent. Very comfortable on the head and ears. This phone does NOT eliminate ambient noise, nor is it designed to do so."
3,I love them when they're on my head but...,"The papier-mache like material that covers the ear piece is so fragile that it looks crappy all torn up from moderate wear. Then there's the fact that it does not contain the sound at all. People in my office can hear my music very well. I really don't care but that's something that might bother me one day. I was thinking about giving it one star so people would see this review but that would be very unfair because the sound quality is real crisp and clear making up for the aformentioned flaws. If you can get some covers for the ear pieces, then you could eliminate that problem. My three star review won't do any damage to it's overall score, I just wanted to warn people about these minor cosmetic and design flaws."
3,Great until one of the ears stopped working.,Got this a couple of months ago in April. Great headset. A little tight on the ears but they worked and sounded great. Until today one of the ears just stopped working. I have to say now that I have buyers regret seeing as these things only lasted a couple months. I even took really good care of the headphones. I hate to say that I will probably not buy Sony over-the-ear headphones again.
3,Static,"I bought these headphones for my partner for Christmas. When we tried them with the iPad they were very staticky. We tried them with the iPod and laptop and the sound was still staticky. So, back they went. I think I'll try the Beats headphones despite their crazy price."
4,I like it,"A little bulky but very good sound (one of the best at tis price range) I recommend it for day to day use unless you are an audiophile, then you should consider Bose or similar brandname headphones"
4,Excellent Headphones,"I bought these for recording and layering music, and so far, they have been excellent. The highs and lows are quite dynamic, and the overall sound is very crisp. The only real issue is that these aren't as tough as I expected. The frame is a tad flimsy, though there have been no breaks or anything on it (just worries me when traveling with them). Best headphones for the price!"
1,Died in less than a month.,"The headphones had great sound quality, while it lasted. The wires got tangled easily and then the headphones stopped working in less than a month that I purchased it."
2,good headphones but bad quality,"i ordered this product after reading all the reviews. great pair of headphones, but they started buzzing after only a few songs played. whenever a lower bass note is played, the left size buzzes slightly but noticeably. this was very disappointing."
4,Far better than most 300 dollar headphones.,"A relative bargain when compared to ""fashion lifestyle"" headphones. The Sony 'phones were always known for being quite good and these out perform many costlier headphones. The ear pads will fall apart after a year or two, so expect to have to replace them. This happens to most headphones with this type of ear pad. This isn't unique to Sony."
5,Great Headphones,"I would recommend these to anyone. They are a little expensive coming from someone who isn't heavily ""into"" music, but paying the few extra bucks was well worth it. They made a nice gift for my boyfriend so when he plays the guitar in the living room he gets to hear his music and I can relax at the same time. So I guess they were a gift for both of us. Thanks again!"
5,Love These!,"I'm coming from a pair ofPanasonic RP-HTX7PP-A Retro Style Monitor Headphones (Blue)that had their ear pads worn-out in only 8 months... The ear pads were $16 each to replace! No thank you!Judging by the other Sony MDR-V6 customer reviews and suggestions for better headphones (on Bose headphone reviews) I decided to order a pair. People saying their first pair lasted for 10 or 15 years is what I wanted to hear after owning several pairs of headphones that wore-out far too quickly.I've owned these headphones for almost a month now and couldn't be happier.Durability aside, the sound quality is great. I've had enough different pairs of headphones and home speakers to be able to judge sound quality. The MDR-V6 aren't dramatically better than my old Panasonic headphones but they do have noticeably richer overall sound and better bass. I enjoy balanced sound for my wide taste in music and these headphones are great for anything I've listened to with them.Happy customer here."
4,Love them.,"I have bigger-than-average ears and wanted over the ear headphones. These just made it (which was a first for me with other over-the-ear models).Quality, fantastic. If you wear them for more than a few hours straight (as I do), you may feel a little pressure. They also can be warm if worn it hot environments."
5,MDR-V6,These headphones are better than beats and the included adapter make the headphones even better since you can do even more things with them
2,Incredibly uncomfortable,"These headphones give me a persistent headache every time I wear them. As a matter of fact, I think they have created a bruise on the crown of my head.I am very angry that I paid $100 for these things, thinking they were going to be the best sounding and most comfortable pair of headphones, and ideal for long-term, hours-of-studying, use. They are not.I switched back to my $45.00 Sennheiser HD 212Pros that are probably 10 years old and sound 80% as good as the Sonys, but don't try to drill into my skull. I gotta tell you, any reduction in the sound quality is well worth a reduction of the amount of skull-drilling.I know, they're supposed to be industry standard. What can I say other than stay away if you're planning to wear these for more then 20 minutes at a time!"
2,Disappointing,"I received this product about a week ago. Great packaging and great coil extension. While replicating sounds beautifully at high and medium volumes, the left side of the headphones made scratchy noises or stopped working altogether at low volumes.Something that also bothered me is that this is an over-the-ear design. I believe one of the reviewers said that these headphones would isolate you from the world and would make people talking to you look like they were lip-synching. That's total nonsense. Even while playing my digital piano, I can hear the TV going in the family room next door. If you want isolation, buy an around-and-over-the hear set, not this one."
3,Pounding Bass????,"After reading all the praises over these headphones, I decided to purchase them..so know I wonder, I don't know what kind of music you guys listen to, but it's not that these things have not the greatest bass, is that they simply do NOT have bass.I would definitely use these phones for what they were made for at first, which is fidel monitor reproduction or studio works, but on a everyday basis, they just totally don't do it for me.Any reccomendations?"
2,Too much physical noise for me,"I read all the reviews and bought these headphones, but now I barely use them. The reason? I use headphones for recording in my home studio. While playing guitar or any instrument for that matter, if the headphones move at all against my head, I hear the friction sound transmitted very loudly. It's quite annoying, and I keep finding myslef trying to hold perfectly still, which is awkward. Similarly, if I try to use these to listen to music while laying on a pillow, the slightest movment causes them to scuffle and squeak. I think maybe it's their lightweight construction that transmits external friction so readily. I'm not sure why everyone thinks these are so great. I had a pair of the old-school MDR V600s and those were amazing. I foolishly sold them and now I'm looking for another pair used."
5,"Thanks, reviewers!","It was totally all the other reviews that convinced me to buy these for my musically-inclined boyfriend for Christmas. All the specs and whatnot meant absolutely nothing to me, I just set out to find a good pair of studio quality, aesthetically pleasing headphones, and these were it!"
5,Best value of money for home studio monitoring,"Oh MY GOD These headphones are extremely amazing - I can't believe they are not very expensive although they are worth far more than of their price. I Love them. but the bad thing is that, after listening them, now i can't enjoy any other headphones because they can't reach my expectations which I developed from V6s.These headphone are amazing for home studio monitoring, the sound quality is excellent compared to others because with this price no any other headphones give that much sound quality, these provide very flat frequency response, which means you hear what is actually recorded without any equalizer effects, for example, bass boost or high frequency boost, so the natural sounds come out and you can use as a live sound monitoring.The only thing which I don't like is that they are not comfortable for long time usage, because after wearing it for an hour, it makes my ears sweat and red, otherwise the its very nice and durable,"
5,Godly Sound - This is what you need for a quality listening experience.,My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.
4,Nice cans,"I purchased this product because my brother had a pair. We are both musicians, so we use his pair mainly for writing, recording, and mixing.But I needed something more comfortable and powerful than those terrible earphones that come with iPods for my leisurely listening. These are comfortable, with the around-the-ear design clamping down on the head and actually isolating a good portion of the sound (and I ride the bus for 2.5hrs a day so I can tell you how nice it is to block out the noise). I also use them at home to watch movies, and the sound is crisp, clear, and well-rounded. I listen to blues, hip-hop, funk, pop, and electronic music. They do the lower ends justice, and the mid-range POPS.I recommend these cans for any music aficionado, whether you play it, write it, or just love kicking it and listening to it."
4,Great sound,"I recieved my headphones today from amazon.com and immediately plugged them in. the sound quality is excellent, but the first thing that got me was the ear padding size difference.my older mdr-v600's had a larger design which allowed my whole ear to sit inside with room. these new ones allow it to do so, but have no room what-so-ever. its like they are made to JUST allow your whole ear to enter and that's it.As far as quality, it feels cheaper than my mdr-v600s.But as far as sound quality, it is far superior to the v600's. I had distortion in the v600s where as the v6 would play as much bass as I could handle until I felt nauseated haha!.Overall I give it a 4 out of a 5 and im sure I can get used to the new design, but I wish they would make the v6 with the comfort of the v600!"
5,awesome headphones for the price,"These sounded great and felt really good for extended wearing. It provides awesome sound isolation. The bass improved after the headphones were broken in after a few days. the v6 provides a natural sound unlike alot of phones that are bass heavy. the thing i did not like was the fact that the hinge that connected the headband to the ear cup is made of plastic and the small wiring leading out of the headband for each ear cup seems like it could get snagged and torn. other than than, these sound great. The downside is that the hinge is plastic. I hope they will not snap after prolong use."
3,not a good choice for your mobile music,"I bought these headphones to listen to music on my android phone when I'm commuting, but the jack isnt a snug fit and the cord is super long and heavy. It would be probably be great for a stationary system. The sound quality was fine but didn't blow me away."
4,Vey good headphones.,U bought these headphones for a Christmas gift for my father to use with his iPhone. The headphones arrived very quickly and in time for the holiday. My father was very happy with them! The sound is great!
5,Great sounding headphone,I use these every day at work. They are very comfortable and the sound is great. The cord length is nice and long so you can move around with them.
5,Thank you Sony,"They sound just as good as some 200 dollar cans, and if your not an audiophile you're seriously not gonna hear the difference between these, and say... some Beats by Dre. I use them to mix tracks with fruity loops, listen to the ipod, and i game with these, they do all that better than i thought they would. Deep bass, clear mids, you can really hear the ""space"" of the audio like more expensive headphones, 5 stars!"
4,Nice!,This is an excellent set and comfortable on my small head. I look forward to more entertainment with these. The package arrived safely and on time.
5,Can't go back!,These headphones are amazing and I would recommend them to anyone wanting a top notch music experience without paying $500. The only draw back to them is that I can't go back to anything else short of a high end stereo or live concert without cringing from the loss of quality.
4,"Great Sound, Comfortable, but Beware Eyeglasses Wearers!","I just picked up a set at Fry's at lunch, and agree with the others here that they are comfortable and sound very good. Unfortunately, the soft earcups are very susceptible to any little noise source, including movement of eyeglass frames and touching/scratching your cheek. I really wish that stores would have headphones on display so that you could find things like this out at the store. I also think that the earcups will get hot and sweaty with extended use. So far the Bose TriPorts are the only units that I have found that are comfortable and don't create this noise from rubbing, but I don't particularly like their sound, plus they cost twice what these do."
3,"Definitely not worth the $109 price tag, not really worth the $67 price tag either","I got these headphones during the Black Friday sale for 49.99 and have been using them since then. It comes with a cheap-feeling bag for carrying (which I haven't used yet, I'm mainly using these at home). I previously owned a pair of iHome iB40B headphones (around $20). The sound quality on these headphones are better overall; better bass, better acoustics, etc, but not really worth the upgrade. However, they are also much more comfortable, and I can wear them for long periods of time without any issues. One final issue I've had with the headphones is that putting them around my neck is very uncomfortable as the circum-aural design make the headphones very big. Overall, if you can get them on sale for around fifty bucks I think it is worth it, otherwise it's not really worth almost 70 dollars."
5,Wonderful!,"These headphones are amazing. The sound quality is great. Neutral to some extent. The bass is true, the mid-range is strong, and the treble is clear. The supplied 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch adapter lets you use your headphones on your home theater set-up. These headphones can really handle all the power from your amplifier and can actually benefit when you start adjusting the sound.The stock earpads are okay. I bought the Beyerdynamic Pads which are way more comfortable than the supplied ones. Plus, they add a bit more bass, which is great.These cans have the reputation of being extremely tough. I can't really say much about that, since I've owned them for a couple of months barely. But I'm hoping to get some years from these."
5,Purchase these for my son who loves music but doesn't love how headphone feel.,"My son loves these! He is sensitive about headphones being too tight and these are not tight at all. We have all tried them out a few times and the sound quality is so good that now my husband wants a set as well.The sound quality is excellent. When i put them on it sounds like I am in a huge room with sound filling the space.When you are wearing them, you can not hear the noises or voices in a room if people are talking so the noise canceling quality it awesome as well!"
5,"fair price,fair sound.",Going back 20 years a go whenvi was 26 years old and use to enjoy my sony mdr v3. It was then and today we are older and steel enjoy sony headphones but this time it is the sony mdr v6.Not exiting like my sennheiser ie80 snd not nuteral like my sony mdr ex600 but not bad at all.The nostalgic also play a part here.Bottom line:the sony mdr v6 certenly worth the money.
5,Great for years,"I received these headphones as a gift in 1985, 28 years later they are still used by me on a daily basis. I have had all of the earbuds that come with the iPod or iPhone, and those are great for just using phone etc. But when I want to listen to music at home I always reach for the Sony MDR V6 headphones. I have had the same problem as others with the ear pad cover disintegrating but that has not at all affected these headphones. Oh one other small problem thru the years was a cat chewing through the cord. So I had to cut out a small piece of cord and reattach it to the headphones. But even with that small tragedy still has the best sound I have heard in headphones."
4,Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil,"Great headphones for the price...I'm a radio DJ and use them everyday. After 16 years of using all different kinds of headphones, they're still my favorite."
5,Purchased as a gift,"Bought these headphones as a gift for my son after he researched different products and decided on these. I said I thought they would be good, since I bought a pair of Sony V6 way back in 1987, and I still have them! The current design appears to be identical to my pair, so I guess if it ain't broke, why fix it? The only complaint I have ever had about Sony headphones is that the ear cup pad material falls apart after a couple of years or so, but other than that I highly recommend these."
3,"Beautiful sound, but uncomfortable","Love the sound, but it is very uncomfortable after 15-20 minutes of listening. I have a relatively big head, but still, there should be a reason why it has an adjustable headband. So if you're overweight (even if not morbidly obese), avoid this one.I have a set of cheap Koss on-ear headphones which are 100 times more comfortable. Of course, the sound is in different leagues."
4,"Nice Headphones, Flat, Light on Bass","These are nice and clear, flat sounding headphones. Good separation and balance. They do not, to my ears, go down to 5hz as advertized. Though the bass is clear it is lacking for both mixing and listening."
4,Sound good right out of the box,These headphones sound pretty good right out of the box. I'm gonna use these mainly for home studio use. I have a pair of Bose AE2's that I use for everyday casual listening. I will be burning in my Sony's though to see if the burn in makes them sound even better. The only reason I gave them four stars is mainly cause Amazon has the wrong warranty information posted on these. I bought these thinking I would have a 1 year warranty but its actually only 90 days. I figured for a product that's been out for about 20 years now that it would have a better warranty than that.
3,"Great sound, ok comfort","Pro:Great sound. Fairly effective sound isolation. Well built.Cons:i don't find these headphones to be super comfortable for extended wear.1) They are tight on my head2) My ears are bigger than the hole, so they kind of pinch.It might be that after a while they'll stretch out or relax to my head.... and they will become more comfortable."
3,Quality sound,"I have enjoyed using these headphones. After years of use, however, small pieces of the membrane that enclose the cushioning that surrounds the ears have been peeling off of the headphones and sticking to my face. The quality of sound from these headphones is superb though. I use them when I really want to listen to every minute detail of a composition."
2,Fell apart in two weeks,"I bought my first MDR-V6 around 1980 (possibly even earlier but my memory is foggy on exactly when I got it). Round about 2011 the left side stopped sending sound. Up until then, for over 30 years, those headphones were as good as the day I bought them. I retired them and bought a second set. On the first day the outer seams on the lining covering the foam padding came undone on one side. About a week later the inner seams on both sides started to come undone. Now the outer seams are unattached on both sides. The sound is still good, but the craftsmanship is very disappointing. 5 stars for sound and comfort - minus 3 stars for poor craftsmanship for the model I purchased."
1,Bad quality Dont buy this item,I bough these headphones with great expectations. I am a film student and I supposed these headphones will meet my necessities. But my surprise was that 5 months later they dont work. The reparations worth the more than the price of the headphones.AND SURPRISE NO WARRANTY.
2,Not appropriate for outside use.,"I loved these headphones for the 1st hours I had them. Awsome sound. But then, I took my daily walk with them. The first thing I noticed was that they amplified every step I took like a bass drum. They also amplified the cord as it swished and rubbed against my body. When I scratched my face, it sounded like sandpaper. Then when a slight breeze began (5 - 10 mph), it sounded like I was in a hurricane or wind tunnel and drowned out the music. I am returning them. If you just want to use them while sitting still inside, they are awsome, but not good if you're moving around."
3,Sound,The headphones are ok but the sound is not full and rounded they do have an ok bass responce. but i would not recomned these for DJ'S..
4,Good for the price,"Bought this item for use at the office at my cube. The sound production is very good. I've only tried it through my phone's music player using high bitrate mp3's so not exactly the best source, so I'm not going to dig too deep into sound quality. I'll just say that I am happy with the sound production.On the comfort side, the cups are pretty comfortable. I've repeatedly worn these for an hour or so at a time and have not had any discomfort from my ears. The only slight discomfort I experienced was from the head band. I wish there was a little more padding so the band conformed more to my head. As it is, the band makes a pressure point at the top of my head which can be discomforting after awhile. But that could just be the shape of my head.In terms of manufacturering, the product feels quality made, from the band all the way down to the end of the plug. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase."
5,Fantastic Quality!,Absolutely worth your money. I was skeptical at first and dropping $80+ on headphones was something I thought I'd never do. But I did. The quality is amazing.
5,awesome headphones.,"while mixing i can now hear all of the mistakes i make, and can put out a better product when mixing"
5,best headphones,"the sony MDR-V6 is amazing. the deep base sound can be heard clearly while the whole melody is still there. it is indeed the best pair of headphones I owned. for the price your getting, it's a steal. every other headphones that come close or might be slightly better would cost you more than a $100.so if you are a professional, or simply a person who enjoys great music, this product is for you."
4,"Great sound, weird plug",I am very happy with this purchase though it must be said that the weird modular plug does not fit my Galaxy Nexus. I have to use an additional passthrough cable to connect it. The jack is too wide to fit the profile of my phone's audio socket
4,Good sound quality,"Arrived reasonably quick. This headphone is from the last generation (age-wise). It has better quality than many current more expensive name-brand models by different manufacturers. Good sound quality for the money. However, I have a big head and feel the headphone clamming on my head overly tight just like several other reviewers have commented. My son loves it and it doesn't bother him. He is using it all the time."
5,Vintage,I bought my Sony MDR-V6 in 1990 after doing a bit ofresearch and reading about what others had experienced with this product. It still sounds terrific and other than replacing the worn ear pads this headphone is worth triple the price I paid for so many years ago.
5,The Best,"Love these things, this is my second pair. They seem a little expensive till you put them on. Worth every penny."
5,great headphone,This was my first headphone 15years ago. A sony seller frind of my fayher gifted it to me. It was already old but I loved it. All of you can notice. This is the headphone with less 1 star in amazon. Only 2%.. Yes ihave had sennheiser. They are less confy.Good and bads1-its really neutral. Sound is great and i know from experience that the speakers will last years.2. The cord is strong.3. Its comfortable. I could sleep wih them on.4.I connected it to my component and damn. My ears vibrated.5.If taken care of they will las years. Can be modded and repaired.6.I use them with my phone.7. Best headphone dor the price.8. This is a neutral headphone. It reproduces things just like they were recorded. If you want trebles or lots of basd you will have to do it with the Equalizer. Its great since i listen to all kinds of music.
4,Nice headphones,"I've been using my MDR-V6 headphones almost every day for the past month or so, and I really like them. I listen to all kinds of music, and have been quite happy with the sound.I wasn't sure if my MP3 player (Sansa e280 w/ RockBox) would have enough power to drive them, but I've had no issue with the volume or sound quality.For on ear headphones, they are relatively comfortable. The head band does not provide excessive pressure, but after a couple hours I am usually ready to give my ears a short break. The ear pads are comfortable enough.I wasn't sure if I'd like the coiled cord, but after using it, I don't think I'd want to go back to a straight cord. It's thicker than a straight cord, but it makes it easier to manage when I'm working at my desk. The information card that came in the package proclaims that the coiled cord gives you an ""action radius"" of 3 meters.Overall, I am happy with the headphones, and I would buy them again."
5,replacement headphones,had to replace my Sony MRR V150'S that were coming apart ... have had high end Pioneer and Bose but these take the cake. Really great sound from the home system and my IPOD at work. Only problem is they get uncomfortable if I wear them too long ie; 4 hours> Also my ears get sweaty. Really well worth the cost though.
2,Static problems at plug,"These are some of the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. The sound quality is good--everything comes through clearly and cleanly. Unfortunately, I'm running into the same problem a number of other people here have mentioned. Static from the plug end. I'm not sure if it's the plug itself or the wire but the slightest movement can cause static and even cause one of the speakers to cut out. It's bad enough that my android devices think I've disconnected the headphones and helpfully pause the music. I returned the first pair but the second pair had the exact same problem. I've tried them on multiple devices--phone, tablet, PC, even on a home stereo with the adapter it comes with. Same problem everywhere. I'm not sure what happened at Sony but I'd advise staying away from these headphones until they fix the issue."
5,Terrific headphones!,"You get a lot of product for the price with these headphones. And, the adjustable headband makes it comfortable for even my rather large head."
5,High sound quality - perfect amount of bass,My daughter uses these to compose techno/electronic music and says they are the best she's had yet. Great price too!
5,Nice Headphones,I bought these to use while playing our digital piano. I first tried them out on a receiver and they sounded bad. I expected this from the comments here.I set the head phones down and played a pop station through them all night. The next day they sounded a lot better. They now sound great for the piano or recorded music.
4,Sony MDR-6 Head Phone,"This is a great pair of Head Phone set,but i use to have the first gen. and that was made in JAPAN,but that was back in 1991 and it much more comfortable than this New one I purchase,but overall it still good quility ear phone."
5,These are the business,"might want to change out the ear cups to something a little more comfortable, but that's only a small complaint. sound quality is great after the initial break-in and i'm considering buying another few pairs before they stop making these bad boys"
4,Worth the Investment,"After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase these headphones. I'm really glad I did. They arrived quickly in the mail after my order was placed. They are the highest quality headphones I've ever owned. The sound quality is great and they fold up nicely. I have not experienced the discomfort that some other reviewers have complained about. My only complaint is that the cord is long and not detachable"
5,Owner for 1 day,"OMG!!! These are awesome straight out of the box. No need for burning in!!! I also own Audio Technica ATH-M50, and Monster Beats Studio. These Sony MDR-V6 blow em both away. The ATH-M50s tend to be a bit flat, the Beats a bit bass heavy. These MDR-V6s are dynamic and LIVELY along all parts of the spectrum. I'm hearing notes, bravados, instrument fades, break-beats that I haven't heard before. As I am writing this, I've only on hour 2 of listening. I'm using my 5G iPod Nano w/o an amp (imagine with a headphone amp!). Seriously, you won't be disappointed in these. Very comfortable, quality construction. Buy one now, the price is right, its worth 3x the price in all seriousness."
4,great sound,i feel like these were a great price for sound quality and comfort. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that there is no volume adjustment on the cord.
5,15.5 years of flawless performance.,"I have owned this set of headphones since the summer of 1991 and they still sound as good now as they did when I purchased them. They were recomended to me buy a local radio DJ and I picked them up at a high-end audio shop locally. I think back then I paid nearly a hundred bucks. I have recently replaced the pads due to age, but other than that perfect performance."
5,Excellent.,"These are, by far, the best headphones I've ever owned. Sony got it right when they invented the MDR-V6's, and that's why they've stayed pretty much the same (even the packaging) for about 30 years. I'd recommend them to anyone."
5,Lasting Quality,"I recently found my original receipt for my first pair of MDR-V6 headphones. It's from 1988. These headphones have been through a lot. The ear pads wore out quickly, many years ago, so I bought replacements from Sony for way too much money ($45) at the time. Then one of the kids left them on the floor and the dog chewed them up (just the ear pads). I saved them in a drawer for a few years and suffered with some MDR-V600 (suck) headphones until I read a review one day about some softer earpads made by a competing company that also fit the V6's. $20 later, I've resurrected my V6's and am once again listening to true sound, rich bass, without the muddiness you get from the V600s.I liked them so much, I bought a second pair for home so I don't have to truck my work pair back and forth.You cannot go wrong with these. Durable, clear, well made, excellent sound reproduction. Not many products are built this well; way to go, Sony."
5,Awesome headphones at an awesome price!!,"I've had many of pairs of headphones in the past, some more expensive and certainly some that were cheaper. I've tested many of them and you just can't buy a better headphone for the money. These have great,but not over-bearing bass response. The highs are very crisp and clear. They are very comfortable on the ears and have very good quality cords and plugs. 74.00 and free shipping, this is un-beatable!!"
4,Good product with reasnable price,It's really a gud product and worth paying so much money for this. One thing that i noticed is it starts swaeting after couple of hours. This might a prob with me only. On the other hand it has a gud bass and sound quality. I recommend this product.
2,Shocking headphones,"The sound quality is good, they are well constructed, the sound is decent, but they shock my ears, repeatedly. Not light shocks either, it's actually quite painful. I've owned several headphones before, and used them in the same pieces of equipment, but never had an issue with static shocks. I would not have purchased these if I knew this would be a problem."
3,"Comfortable enough, great noise isolation, good sound, but poor quality pads","These were delivered to me on Dec 10, 2012. Today is Feb 12, 2013. So, it has been 2 months. I have used these 3-4X/week for several hours.My main complaint about these is that the earpads are very poor quality. They are constructed of foam ""rings"" covered by a thin soft artificial leather, which feels fine to me when worn. However, the stitching has completely failed, tearing open to reveal the white foam within. I have not misused these at all. Quite the contrary: I have been very careful with them. The only stress on the pads was from wearing them.Sony needs to improve these pads. Sewing isn't rocket science anymore."
2,Manufacturer defect,There is static sound at the point where the plug meets the cord when it is moved a little. I returned it for a replacement and the second one is exactly the same. It seems there is a problem with this model.
2,not for me,the sound quality is very good but the headphone making my ear hurt to muchit push so hard .. you will feel that after 30 min of wearing it
4,"Once you break 'em in, you're golden!","The first time I put these on I understood the con of the tightness being expressed by other reviewers. They are pretty tight out of the box, but once you find the right numbers on the adjustable headband and keep breaking them in, the headphone relaxes around your head. I use these a lot as a student at school, so the pads inner seam is starting to come apart inside of the cup, but I wear these for the sound, not for looks.Onto sound, these guys are closed so the sound is not going to breathe, but you really can turn these cans up a good amount before anyone outside can hear them. A plus when you operate in a quiet library like I do. If you like a little more bass like I do(my last headphones were mdr-xb500 Bass Boosters) just turn on the equalizer some. Other than that the sound is very clear. Having had these for 2 weeks they have not failed to live up to expectations and I definitely recommend them to anyone on a budget, but looking for great quality."
5,Eargasm!,"All I can say is glorious. I bought these with a credit I got from some broken Sennheisers-I paid less for these. Well, in the beginning, anyway.First off-these are the most comfortable headphones other than my Bose IE2. They do get hot after a while, but only after 2+ hours. I originally bought these to replace my travel cans, but I ended up buying a second pair to replace my computer speakers. So far, these seem like a solid purchase that'll last a long time."
2,Does high sound quality over-ride an uncomfortable fit?,"This headset does produce beautiful sound from my iPOD but not my computer as there is terrible booming bass from my laptop. The cord is coiled and very long but heavy. Note: this headset is not over-the-ear. It is a large on-the-ear design. My ears are average in size but there is not enough space inside to accomodate my ears and the edges of the pads press on the outer edges of my ears, making them uncomfortable after a few minutes. Listening for more than two hours is out of the question. Oddly the headset is large enough for over-the-ear design, but the ear cushions are flat and will not allow the ear to tuck behind the ear cushion as with my Bose headset. Overall, the discomfort made this a purchase that I regret."
1,It broke after only 18 months of use.,"I brought this headphone 18 months ago. It's not mobile, just sitting on my office desk for my computer. It was not used heavily. Then suddenly on day only the left channel was working, no sound from the right channel. Check with Sony and found out that it's out of warranty and repair cost more than the original. Any idea? It seems to happen to Sony product a lot: product breaks soon after warranty expired."
3,Way too bright,"I tried those from a colleague of mine, comparing directly to the current ""king of cheap cans"" $20 Senn HD201. Very comfortable closed cans, nicely fit the ear. Soundwise, they are too bright, lacking mostly in mid-bass (100-500Hz area). I'm not a bass-head at all, and these seem to have some of the typical deep/DJ bass. Sound is just plain thin. Otherwise they are louder than Senn 201 at the same volume setting, so I guess they are more efficient.Not bad for 70$ if you listen to light jazz of acoustic; there are better cans otherwise."
4,alright,"pros: great sound, comfortable, closed headphones: when you put these puppies on you can't hear ANYTHING apart from the music, also it's hard for outside world to hear you even when you're rocking it.cons: i'm already on my 3rd pair because of the same problem: after about a half year of abuse (i.e shoving them in my backpack) one of the speakers stops working. for the life of me it happened with the first two i had. so i now bought mdr7506's which is basically the same but priced more (go figure). i think sony should make the v6's more tough though. throwing headphones into a backpack is a pretty important thing."
3,"Ok, but where's the bass?","I couldn't help but pick up a pair, based on the positive reviews here, when Amazon offered them at $15.95 (yes, that's $15.95). For that price, they are great, a steal.But, when compared side-by-side with my Sennheiser HD497's, there really is no comparison. The Sony's may be a TAD more comfortable (both feel great) but the Sennheiser's stand well-above the Sony's for sound quality and especially (as other's have mentioned here) when it comes to bass response.If you can find the Sony's for the price I paid, jump all over them - you'll be a ""happy camper"". However, if you are paying $80+, you really should try out the Sennheiser's. I am certain you will enjoy them more."
4,Sweet sounding for a great price.,"These phones are really comfortable. I have flown overseas and worn them for hours at a time with no problem. They sound really good and for the price, I don't think you can beat em."
5,Fantastic set of headphones,I first bought these for myself and found them to be really great. They are very comfortable to use and are almost totally noise cancelling. They were so good that I bought them as presents for family members.
3,hard to wear,I use this to listen to music on my mp3 player at work. The sound is good but after about an hour my ears begin to hurt and I have to take it off.
5,"Sound, price, comfort. A+++","I have always had a pair of headphones, usually purchased at Best Buy or something similar. I used to think price= quality. Turns out in the audio universe, that just isn't true. These headphones are really great for the price, and even for a $150 pair of headphones.Look, bottom line is: these are marvelous headphones. But connected to your laptop or other digital source, you will be missing out on SO MUCH audio quality. Everything either needs to be analog, or you need a semi high-quality USB DAC. Do some research, because given the proper signals, these headphones will really blow your mind. And take all these reviews with a grain of salt. One reviewer might be basing their review on what they sound like on an iPod and another might be reviewing on a $10k audiophile setup."
3,Not for enjoyment listening,"I have a lot of headphones. And have had for many years. I have these, and love them. These are closed-ear, clinical, precise sounding cans. They are hot on your ears. They are harsh. They are good for mixing recordings because they consolidate a lot of listening experiences. When you're mixing music, you need to listen on a variety of sources, sources you expect your music to be heard on: iPod earbuds, car stereos, AM radios, Disco sound systems etc. These are great because they relentlessly show detail. If your mix sounds good on these things, it'll sound good on anything. BUT If you are looking for a comfortable, moving listening experience; check out Grado. Audiophile quality, rich and beautiful. Recordings mixed with these Sony's will sound spectacular on Grados. These are an incredible tool, but they are built for a purpose, and it's work, not pleasure."
2,Severe issues with Cabling,"The sound and performance of these headphones were great for about 6 months. Then the insulated cabling around the joints began to crack severly exposing the inner cabling. I frequently lose signal to the right side of the headphones and I have to bend, twist, stretch and adjust the cable for about 3 minutes in order to restore sound.I think this is a design issue that results when the cabling on each side of the headphones become mashed between the plastic frames and pivoting headphones. If you decide to go this route, the sound is good and I have no other complaints. Just be wary of leaving the cabling slack near the pivot point."
3,Good but not Great Headphones,It was ok not that great coz I was expecting more with this headphones.The sound was not so solid. But I like the fit though it's kinda small.
3,comfortable but not longlasting,"These headphones are very comfortable and worked nicely for about 6 months.Maybe I'm hard on my headphones but I think for the price I paid ,they should last longer than 6 months."
4,Good!,"Ok, this is a fine set of cans. It is excellent for rock any others, because it can go so high. if you are a dj or something i don't think this offer a good amount of punch. I've listened to the v700 and they are of courese better bass pounding experiment, but sound a lot louder. THis is a great headphones for people who would want natural sounds. when i plug this into my keyboard it's sounds so much better than my other headphones. sometime I think this goes up in the treable way too high, and not engouh bass to back it up because i love dance music with requires lots of bass. But the bass aren't horrable."
2,more but less,"Was looking for an alternative to buds and researching old school headphones . This product seemed like a quality starter and apt for just tuning anything online. For your PC these are a great alternative. Sound is good , comfort good , bit heavy. The ear pad came completely off after 3 weeks use and need nimble fingers to replace. It came off again a few days later. I do not recommend the purchase unfortunately beacause of this specific lack of quality construction."
2,did not meet expectations.bass was not there.,I thought it would sound better it doesn't have as much bass... I thought I would have are in a doesn't cover your ear...
4,Not the same as a MDR-7506,"Although both having the same specs, the MDR-V6 are not the same as the MDR-7506. The V6 has a more muddy but bass heavy sound. My 15 year old pair of 7506 appear to have a brighter, crisper, cleaner sound however with less bass. The V6 may improve as it breaks in though."
3,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed with these. To be fair, they sound good and there's nothing really wrong with them except that they're cheaper feeling and less comfortable than my prevous pair of Sony ""Monitor Series"" headphones. I wear them every day so I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to live with these. I guess I needed to go with a more expensive model. And of course I've opened them and tried them so I can't exchange them now - I suppose that's the danger of buying something like this online."
4,Sound good but uncomfortable for ears,"Pros -The audio is good once you burn it for 50+ hrs, the build looks solid that will last yearsCons -Heavy and uncomfortable. It presses hard on ears so you can't listen to for long time!I returned to to get more comfortable ones even though I got these ones at very good price 49$ from Amazon"
1,Earphone pads fall off frequently.,"Don't get me wrong. I love the sound of these headphones. However, the earphone pads are cheap. They fall off a lot. It is hard to get them back on because they slip. Sony ruined a great product with cheap details."
3,Sounds great,"It sounds great. However it doesnt look sturdy at all. There are many pieces that looks like it could get broken in any time. For instance, if it drops from the table to floor by accident. The cable it came with is also pretty short. I dont think this headphones will last long. I dont recommend it."
4,SONY V6 EARPHONES,"GOT THESE EARPHONE TODAY AND WAS IMPRESSED BY THE QUALITY OF THE MATERIALS. I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED, HOWEVER, BY THE EXPOSED WIRES CONNECTING EACH SIDE OF THE EARPHONES. THESE EARPHONES SOUND VERY GOOD WITH SOLID BASS AND OVERALL CLARITY. THEY DID SEEM A LITTLE HARSH ON THE HIGH SIDE, BUT WERE VERY COMFORTABLE TO WEAR. WHILE I LIKE THE OVERALL SOUND OF THESE EARPHONES, THEY ARE NOT QUITE AS SMOOTH AS MY JVC HA-DX3 EARPHONES, WHICH I CONSIDER THE VERY BEST I HAVE EVER HEARD."
3,These are what it's worth,"These headphones are great for the price but IMO, if you save up little bit more money and you can get a much greater enjoyable pair like ATH-M50 or MDR-7510."
4,Amazing lows,"Got these for my teen who is a budding musician. He says "" These headphones have okay mids and amazing lows. They can hurt your ears after a few hours of use from squeezing but its not that bad. I use them for music production and music listening"".He would recommend them."
3,Good but bulky,"These are great speakers even though no noise cancelling feature is there, but one thing I noticed was it is heavy on the head and bulky chord tend to pull the head in the player direction, when you hear it for long time. Decent bass effect"
4,Works as expectedfor the $ paid.,Good product build plus excellent lack of leakage- can we worn at work close to others.
5,6 stars for sound quality,"I use this pair on a Yamaha YDP223 digital piano. I've used several different pairs on the same digital piano, and never imagined how good the sound source was until I plugged MDR-V6 in. Every note is just incredibly clear. The bass notes that used to be slightly muddy are now astoundingly crisp. The treble notes are transparent instead of being metallic (which I always assumed was the way Yamaha sounded).Yes, it's a bit old school in design, and the thick coiled cord is heavy. But it's pretty comfortable to wear for an hour or two. It also seals external sounds quite well.Everybody who owns a digital piano should buy one."
4,good and cheap,"This is a very good headphone for listening and djing. Even though it hasn't many articulations, the sound is very good."
4,Sony MDR V6 are Awesome!,"I have been a fan of Sony headphones for 20+ years now. I purchased a set of MDR V3s back in 1991 and I still have them today! The MDR V6 have a very open and transparent sound coupled with warm natural sounding bass! Also, the ear pads are replaceable available from Amazon!"
4,more comfortable,I returned ATS-HS40s Audio Technica ATHM40FS Precision Studio Headphones in favor of these. The ATS's had slightly crisper sound but were hurt to wear after too short a while. Other reviewers say the sound will improve after burn in.
2,Underwhelmed,"I find these a bit awkward to use which is saying something because I am used to usingjust about anything to get hot things from the oven. But that's not the worst part.The worst part is, after pulling out an item from the oven the silicon on the mitt is extrememly hot.I felt as if I was going to burn myself just by touching the side of the mitt that had made contact withthe pan I had pulled from the oven"
4,pot holder,"Works extremely well at protecting your hand from burns, it is hard to hold, it needs pockets to slip your fingers in so you can grab things. but for a cookie sheet works great."
1,Not worth the money,"Unless you have large hands and someone helping you, forget about these. They are extremely awkward and make getting pans out of a hot oven a risky proposition. The grippy strips that I thought would be such an advantage turned out to be hazardous rather than helpful. Instead of being able to maneuver with them, you have to grab things just right the first time. They are a waste of money.Calphalon Twill Pot Holder, Black Licorice"
5,Good product,"I bake often and had difficulty finding non-silicone pot holders that kept the heat out. These are great as they keep the heat out, are pretty flexible, have good grip and are machine washable and can be dried in the drier!"
5,The Best pot holder ever!!!,This is the best pot holder I have ever used. I can pick up anything from the stove or oven with out feeling my hands getting even warm.
4,excellent product,i have two of the oven mitts but got this for the smaller dishes and its perfect! been using it for many months now and i like all three as a kitchen staple.
1,Awkward shape. Too thin when folded over,"I would not buy this again. The material is good. The shape is awkward. If you bend it in half to grip a handle, the sides are too narrow and you have to worry about yoru hand touching the hot pot."
4,Just keep your thumb in check!,"Those are real nice pot holder. They hold nice and keep the hands cool to touch. The black ones looks really sharp with the black appliances.Just a note, be careful of the middle section. Me and my husband both burned ourselves not being careful at that location."
5,Works wonderfuly,I didn't want to go out and spend $60 on a new low back bra. This product does just the same thing to you regular bra.
4,Now I'll have to read his others,"A very good read, though I had trouble at the start, because of the dark and slightly confusing way the book begins. You have to try to piece together what's going on with insufficient info. Try to read it straight through, so you remember the yet to be connected stuff you need.By about one-third into it, it starts to come together and is amusing, suspensful, and entertaining. The setting in Austin is a bonus to those like me who know some but too little about the area as it is today."
3,not my cup of tea,"This is an award winning author. but I was not able to get into this book. It started off ok, but was slow going. I put this book down several times and read other more exciting books for me. finally finished it when I ran out of other reading material.I much preferred his percy jackson -kids series."
3,A Texas whodunnit,"Rick Riordan's 'The Devil Went Down to Austin' is a fun little murder mystery, starring PI-cum-lit-prof Tres Nevarre. This isn't the most thought-provoking novel that you'll read this year. But it's a quick and enjoyable whodunnit, with enough plot twists and entertaining characters inside to keep you breezing through the pages. Riordan does a good job of explaining the good guys' and the bad guys' motives. And you'll probably be surprised by the unexpected revelations at the end. 'The Devil Went Down to Austin' is good clean fun. And it's a nice little breather if you've just finished reading something a little bit heavy."
4,Fragment cd review,"Luna Sea fans will definately lap up this solo album from Inoran. There are so many great songs in this cd (which I would give a 4 STAR rating to)...one just has to grab hold of it to really bask in the often-underrated brilliance of Inoran. Songs like Spirit, I wish I Never Met You, To Myself, Can You Hear It and Won't Leave My Mind are still playing on my CD player so that will give everyone an idea of how GREAT Inoran is !!! I love it !!!"
5,Mindblowing,"I only read the German version of this book, so my review is based on that. However, this book, a number one bestseller in Germany, really captured me and I would say it is by far the best book I have read tis year. I would classify it as a eco-sci-fi thriller and the overall story is similar to what a Michael Crichton could write. However this book plays in a totaly different league when compared to the aforementioned authors books. The science is more profound and the characters are way better developed. I just hope the English version holds up."
1,Boring!,People are BORING! Seriously - this is totally banal and un-witty and just not interesting. What a waste of time and film.
2,I love most of Bob Odenkirk's work...,"I think I've seen almost everything Bob's been involved with and this just didn't do it for me. If you have friends and they aren't complete dullards, you've probably had most of the conversations you'll see in this movie."
3,Worth a Watch - 3+Stars,"I enjoyed this. It's deceptively engaging. Hard to imagine that listening to four people natter on about various different topics over dinner will amount to much. Actually, I'm not entirely sure it does amount to much. But it's still interesting. There is a real immediacy to your engagement with these people that allows you to really get pulled in at the moments the conversation gets interesting. There are a few surprises. Some of them sort of come out of nowhere, but it creates a feeling that despite the fact these people are just sitting around a table you're never really sure just what might pop up next. I wish the ending had more substance. It's a bit abrupt, and it doesn't in any larger sense answer the questions posed by the film in general. That might be a lot to ask, but this would really have been a winner if the director had managed a greater sense of closure and narrative movement. What's all that mean? Well, so it's not perfect, but it is worth a watch."
4,Good story,A very pleasant read with a nice moral. I was duped at the beginning and gradually swayed by the end as the author intended.
2,Much smaller than I expected,"This ""tower"" was a lot smaller than I was expecting. And you didn't get many chocolates. Not great value, wouldn't order again."
2,Looks much better in the picture,I would not recommend this product as it is not near as nice in person. I ended up having to gift it because of lack of more time but definitely regret it.
3,Not really what I was looking for...,"This was not what I thought it was. I am looking for the companion to the Gregg shorthand book, but I kept it. Maybe I will use it in the future."
3,pretty,only reason I gave this 3 stars because it was a little less lacey than I wanted. Beautiful product but just not as lace showing as I thought and wanted.
4,Horror? Not really...,"Well, I picked up this movie after seeing some reviews and decided, why not? The cover art does not represent the movie at all. Blood and gore is down to a minimum in this movie. I guess what disappointed me most about this film was the lack of the ""typical"" horror movie elements. And I suppose that's what leads me to the classification of this movie as more of a psychological drama. For me, there weren't any scares and nothing to be feared. It was a look into the mind of a person in a coma. But with all that, it was interesting and I'm glad I purchsed it."

4,"Interesting movie, well done, decent twists","I saw this as a preview on another movie and noticed the guy from Ed (Thomas Cavanagh) was in this and thought how bad could this be. It is actually pretty well done, original idea, and played out to give you a hint of what happened, but not the full scope. It is by far not scary, but is quite entertaining in it's presentation and the unfolding of the plot. Simple plot summary, a young 40 year old man goes in for a routine procedure after his birthday party, and the routine is suddenly ripped away, and a series of odd events start to occur. Rent or buy this movie and fine out what happens next."
1,Horrofying to watch!,"It can't get more boring than this. It really made me sleep during the movie. The Blu-Ray transfer is one of the worst I've ever seen, very, but very grainy and a regular DVD can show your HDTV off better than this. If you don't believe me go ahead and buy this. But If I were you I would rent it or watch it at a friend's house first, you'll be surely disappointed in it. I truly regret having bought this."
1,So awful it's truly sublime.,"Horrible pacing, wooden acting, pointless foreshadowing. The preview markets the film as a horror film. It's nothing of the sort.Jacob's Ladder while slightly different is much more effective.I don't get the title either. The definition of sublime is to inspire awe. There's nothing awe inspiring here at all."
3,""""" sublime """"","--------This movie is not gonna be liked buy everyone , it is slow and not even a horror movie as said to be . the acting and characters are good , it's just slow and long ."
3,Substained...,This movie makes you scared to go to the Doctors. I thought there would be more blood and gore. The scene is set in a hospital where a man goes through a emotional rollercoaster of mental fear. Basically Nightmare on Elm Street meets ER.
1,Edited review,"After reading review by the Screenwriter, Mr. Erik Jendresen (thank you!), I see ""Sublime"" somewhat differently; I realize how it MIGHT appeal to some, and the acting is superb indeed.""Sublime"", other than being sublimely boring, subtly promotes mercy killing - pulling the plug of life support, which makes it look like it were sponsored by Dr. Jack Kevorkian or by health insurance companies. The undiscerning viewer will get the idea that it is better to pull the plug than keep your relative alive in comatose state, because, who knows, they might be nastily tortured in their hallucinations while unconscious. ""It's true! It's true! They even made a movie about it!""The DVD cover art is misleading; it is made to attract (and sorely disappoint) the ""Saw 1, 2, 3, 4..."" fans. I'm afraid that most average viewers, myself included, would consider watching ""Sublime"" a miserable waste of time."
1,Pointless Depress-Fest,"This movie doesn't live up to its own hype. First of all its hardley sexual or sexy and its certainly not graphic, you expect more from the heavily advertised ""(Unrated Edition)"".I find the whole racist angle of this movie very disturbing and quite unpleasant. There's some black tough-guy fruit-of-islam type who terrorizes the victim using vulgar disgusting humiliating racial innuendo and extremely explicit violence. Its not exactly creative to say lets have a big black guy tear up a defenseless white guy, all the while this supposedly represents his inner racism. Pretty pathetic.I won't give away the plot or the ending but, needless to say, it could have just as easily been a entire ""dream sequence"". I will be selling my copy of this movie as soon as possible because it would be a waste of space in my collection."
3,Good general map but it wasn't needed....,"This is a good map to get an overall idea of Koh Samui Island, but it wasn't detailed enough. You really couldn't navigate on the road using this map. There are plenty of great maps you can get for free in Koh Samui that are very detailed. My suggestion is don't buy this map!!! Wait until you get there (great place by the way)."
1,Disappointed,Product doesn't work. Very cheaply made and over priced. I would give this product 0 stars unfortunetly this review forces you to mark a star.
4,Good guidance to the world of analysis,This book is very helpful to those student who want a advanced calculas process and need a basement to the study of real analysis. This book has many example which are very helpful to the student and we can have a chance to think about the process to the solution. Best textbook of what i have read this year!!
3,CERTAINLY WORTH READING,"With all due respect to the other reviewers, we Richard Harris fans should stick together, but I'd stop well short of calling this book a disappointment. Certainly, some pictures would have been a worthy addition, but by and large, the book is written in a detailed journalistic manner by someone who had clearly spent time with Mr. Harris. I've read all three biographies and learned something new in each of them. I read this book last, and yes, it was written well before his passing. One reaches the 'The Field' at the end of the book and realises, that at the time of writing, Mr. Harris had a good last run ahead of him. He was a rare bird, and fans can certainly read him back into life in the pages of any of these books."
2,For experienced agents only,"Being a new real estate agent I brought this book with the hope that it would help me build my new business. I was wrong. This book mainly talks about looking at your past few years of realestate sales and changing your program using your past data into a better program. Utterly useless for the beginning agent. Carla Cross has a very good title writer for her books, since i brought her another one of her books in vain."
4,Scofield meets Vai,"This was my first Greg Howe, and I probably couldn't have picked a better starting point. Wooten and Chambers are both great musicians in their own right, and Howe gives them plenty to work with (and why isn't Dave Cook mentioned on the cover?!). Would've been a five, but the whole album has an apprehensive undertone, probably due to the fact that they recorded the parts separately (notice the ""recorded at __'s home studio"" in the leaflet, not to mention the pre-production drums). If these four were in the same room during recording, you would know it. Nevertheless, the songs are solid, just enough drive for rock and all the rambling solos of a good jazz artist. Maybe give Wooten a longer solo next time... Overall, certainly worth a listen.My faves: Crack It Way Open, Lucky 7, A Delicacy"
1,inaccurate description,"well, this is suppose to be a miniature bulb to fit the hood light recepticle. they sent me the bulb size for the tailight and turn signals. 100% wrong."
3,Nice book,"It's a nice book which contains very simple instructions and it is good for basic learners who want to learn how to draw baby animals. I set only 3 stars as I already own another book from C.Hart, it's content is the same but only a few pages at the back are different. When I was ordering this one I thought it will be different to the one I already have, but actually it is not. If you already own a Hart's book on how to draw cats, I would not recommend getting this one as it contains a pretty much the same content."
2,Swept Away: A Story of Survival,"I knew I wanted this book (for personal reasons) before looking for it on Amazon. It's a wonderful, inspirational story of a true miracle of survival and simply the will to live."
5,No wrist pain,"I spent the last two years using this mousepad and recently tried the 3M precision mousing surface. The surface was fine, but the mock-leather (i bought the fancy one) wrist wrest felt like a brick. After 48 hours i returned it and went back to this. It's not the fanciest mousepad on the market, and its not the prettiest (note: available in different colors, just google or go to their site) but this thing works."
1,Not so good now,"I have an older one and should have paid more attention to the newer posts. The new wrist rest is way, way too hard. Almost useless now."
2,the new one isn't the same as the old one,"I had an old one of these that I have had for many years, and I really like it. So I decided to get another one for my other desk.The packaging shows a photo of the old one (the blue/yellow striped background photo in the packaging). But the item itself is the new version.The old version has a thick squishy gel material that is very comfortable and has lasted well even after these many years. The new version has a much more firm material, is flatter, and isn't sloped. It isn't nearly as comfortable.Since the packaging still appears to show the old product, I suspect that this change occurred recently. So all of the glowing reviews listed here on Amazon are for the old product (which is indeed a great product). I can't recommend this new product.Scott"
4,"Old version was better, but this is still good.","I had one of these at work years ago, & just ordered one for my current job. As others have pointed out, the design has changed recently. The gel wrist pad is MUCH firmer, and not as thick. I do prefer the original version.However, the current design is still better than other devices I've found. I like that it has a rigid base, so you can actually let it hang out past the edge of your keyboard tray & thus get it closer to your body, which is a more natural position & reduces shoulder/arm stress. Though the gel wrist pad is firm, it's still much softer than a desktop! Some thought the original wrist pad was too high, so they might actually prefer this one. Some also find the mouse pad dimensions too small, but I've never had a problem with it. Glad I didn't get scared off by the more recent reviews -- this is still a great choice for me."
1,Not as it used to be,"I had bought this product some years ago and it has been terrific. The gel wrist rest was and still is very comfortable. I decided to get a new one as it had gotten quite dirty. This new wrist rest is the same model as the one I have. However, the cushioning on the new one virtually doesn't exist. It felt very hard and uncomfortable. The one I've had for 9 years and have used every day for that period of time has at least twice the amount of cushioning in the rest as the new model does. So very disappointed as this rest looks very nice and fits perfectly on my keyboard tray."
2,Good mousepad...check dimensions before buying,"This is a very comfortable mousepad to use, however I didn't pay attention to the size and when I received it found that my dell mouse (an older scroll wheel mouse) took up 40% of the scrolling surface area. I've had to compensate for this so I'm not constantly lifting the mouse by drastically increasing the pointer speed so the pointer moves further with smaller movements. It's a quality product but only works well with small mice."
3,wrist pad not soft enough,"For those of you with wrist issues (I have tendon-itis), the wrist pad may not be soft enough for you. It is too firm for me. The lower part of my palm gets sore quickly. I'm going to return this and try one of the gel pads."
2,Not as good as before,"I bought the newer Fellows mouse pad to replace my old Fellows mouse pad. It lookded exactly the same but, they have changed the wrist pad. It is not as squishy and it is not as high as the other one. Not nearly as compfortable as the other one."
2,Used sold as New,"The product itself looks to be what I need, however, product came in an open package and product looked used. I think I paid enough for a new mousepad and not a return item. Probably will not ever buy from this seller again. That practice is very unprofessional."
4,Wrist Rest,"I stumbled on an older version of this and the older version was softer than this one. It was blue and this is grey. I like the older one better but for the money it's a good deal. I like it, just not as much as the previous version. They're 20 bucks in the stores."
2,Not good for long term use,"I bought this mouse pad because I mainly want a wrist rest. The gel pad was a little bit high but it's tolerable. After a year of long term use, the gel sunk in the middle and it's not coming back out. I find it hard to use now and looking for another one. If you're looking for a mouse-pad to use for a long time, I wouldn't recommend this one."
2,Very poor design.,"This product is just too small. A regular 99 cent mouse pad from Walmart is better than this product. I have to constantly pick up my mouse to manuver my screen. I was so frustrated with the item that I pushed it aside and grabbed a nearby magazine to use as a mouse pad. Believe me that magazine did a 100% better than the Fellowes pad. The wrist pad is great, but if you cannot manuver your computer a nice comfortable wrist rest will not be needed. I wish I could return the item. It's creators did a very poor job of thinking through its design after manufactured. So Welcome to ""Made in CHINA."" We send our plans to China, they slap something together and return to America. I do not recommend this item to anyone until or if Fellowes looks at the design flaws of their product."
2,Not the same as old,"Agree with other reviewers. This is NOT the same quality as the original. I ordered a few of these and sent all but one back since a client seemed to like. The biggest downside is the wrist pad is smaller, harder, and does not come off of the plate like it use to. I still have my original (60143) on my desk after 10+ years and am completely satisfied.. was simply hoping to pass on a quality product. No joy here."
2,Too hard,I prefer gel to memory foam wrist pads so I thought I would like this product. It is too hard and was very uncomfortable for me to use. I have already given it away.
3,PG Woodhouse at the End of Time,"Treading water between epics, Michael Moorcock here offers us a collection of five short (ish) stories, all taking place within the decadent setting he first introduced to us in ""The Dancers at the End of Time"" cycle. These stories all span the same time period as the above collection, and take place during Jherek Carnelian and Amelia Underwood's voyages away from the end of time. Consequently neither of them feature in any of the narratives, apart from the odd line of dialogue referring to them. This collection has been described as Woodhouse crossed with Brecht. Certainly there is a lightness of touch here but unfortunately the writing style starts to feel a little laboured by the time you get to the fourth, and longest, segment. Keep going, though - the last story, Elric at the End of Time, is very funny, reveals several interesting new facts about the multiverse, and serves to confirm this collection's place in the 'Eternal Champion' cycle."
3,Good interlude,"This is a good interlude in a long series. Like its companion, Dancers at the End of Time, it represents a light harted interlude in what can be a very heavy series of stories. Overall, enjoyable but you can skip it if you want to save time or money on this series."
1,Disappointing high end tone,"The device works fine for reducing treble, covering the full range of a normal tone control in one half turn. But I cannot detect any effect at all when adjusting to cut the low end (the unit's only promised benefit). I watched a youtube video demo of a Strat having this control and also couldn't notice any change when trying to cut the low end. Perhaps this gadget is just a practical joke.My unit also completely cuts off the signal when turned full clockwise. Perhaps it is defective. But it's not worth removing and returning.Overall, this impulse buy was a total bust."
2,What a disappointment,"The anguish I went through to finish watching this disc. Tommy Flanagan plays impeccably, but his side men trashed the performance. Bass man Betts rushed all the tempi to where drummer Durham had no choice but try and keep up with him. Tommy tried to keep the tempi down but Betts kept playing way to far ahead of the beat to where it felt like a runaway train.Compared to the rest of the Norman Granz series the sound is not the best on this one. The bass is over miched and the overall balance of the three instruments are uneven. The only saving grace were the slow tracks where the tempi remained steady.Tommy deserved better. I'll probably never watch this video again. I don't recommend it."
5,Immaculate,"This trio set from 1977 shows off the immaculate skills of the great Tommy Flanagan. Best known as an accompanist, for among others Ella Fitzgerald, here he gets a chance to stretch out in his own right.The numbers played are:BarbadosHeat WaveSome Other Spring/Easy LivingStar Crossed Lovers/Jump For JoyWoody 'N' YouBlue BossaAccompanying Flanagan are Bobby Durham on Drums and Keeter Betts on Bass.Like all the DVD's in this series the playing is of the highest standard, so you won't be disappointed."
3,Pendent a little too big,The pendent is a little too big for the necklace being so close to your collar. It is kind of cheap construction. You get what you pay for.
2,Illogical,"I'm interested in the topic of nihilism, and for a while, it seems that Novak has something to say about the topic. Unfortunately, the book is just one logical fallacy after another. At first, it was still an interesting book, because it showed what a flawed view on the topic would look like, but you can only take so many pages of non-sequiturs, bald assertions and stolen concepts before moving on to better books.I give the book two stars instead of one because he does have some interesting things to say. If you're reading in the sense of having a nice conversation on the topic, the content of which is to be largely forgotten at the end, it might be worth a run-through. But if you're looking to gain knowledge about nihilism, it's not very useful, not very well-integrated, and not at all well-argued. A careful reading yields disappointment after a few dozen pages."
3,The Look of Buster Keaton,"While I love Buster Keaton, this book is a little bit, shall I say, ""out there""? It's specifically about Buster's eyes, but more pages are dedicated to abstract art and such than Buster's eyes. Mistakenly, the author states that Buster's eyes were blue; they were not blue, they were ""hazel"", according to Eleanor Keaton, Buster's wife.The book is OK, but not something that a Keaton fan should feel is missing from their collection if they don't have it."
3,The Decline of an American Classic,"Reno 911! continues with this 6th season. Three cast members are gone, Garcia (Carlos Alazraqui), Clementine Johnson (Wendy McLendon-Covey) and Kimball (Mary Birdsong), replaced by Ian Roberts and Joe LoTruglio from The Upright Citizen's Brigade and The State respectively. As much as I loved the earlier seasons of this show, I just can't help but feeling that these guys are running out of material. The scenes seem to repeat the same formula over and over and the new additions seem to be caricature, one-dimensional and worst of all, uninteresting. True, LoTruglio's character was interesting at first, a cocaine-addled wild card rogue who blasted his way through any situation, but that angle seems to have been lost shortly after being introduced. Still better than most shows on TV, Season 6's worst enemies are Seasons 1-5."
3,Not as good,"This show was great until this season. Without Garcia, Kimball, and (surprisingly) Johnson the show just has a lot to be desired. The new replacements aren't good, I don't like them. It's a disappointing end to a great series."
4,Still a great show!,"Even at the end of the series, this show kept me laughing. I like the characters and their interactions. There was never a dull moment for me! :)"
3,How soon gone?,"Reno 911 at one time was the best thing on TV for live action comedy. Then, in the blink of an eye, it was quietly cancelled. Never heard about why either.The show started out as a great spoof of police procedures and personnel; the cops were breaking all procedures and often the law itself on every show. But, it was funny all the same, as most of us like to see satire about staid institutions like the law or law enforcement.The last season, shown on these disks, was brief, as were all the seasons of Reno 911. Also, they changed the players, getting rid of the blonde police ""bimbo"" and Garcia, whether due to contractual problems or other reasons. They added two ""white guys"" who were funny but made the show too ""one dimensional"" and actually dull. They tried to use Wiegel to replace the blonde role as a ""tart"", and she was (very surprisingly) an attractive woman under the short hairdo. After all is said, you come away feeling that the show was properly cancelled..."
5,The 4th UNCUT DVD of the Lost Episodes,"In this DVD Goku must battle the Para Para Brothers who can make people dance. Then he must battle Cardinal Mutchy Mutchy and stop Luud from being activated. Great episodes. Cant wait until Activation is released.Episodes 10-12 UNCUTSuggested rating:PG for violence.Japanese version:PG-13 for violence, nudity"
4,Good Songs but No Surprises Here,"The songs on this CD have all been heard a million times and overplayed on the radio, but this is a decent collection if you like female country singers. You won't be surprised by any of the songs."
4,Awesome Women of Country,This album has many of my favorite artists and songs on it. A great compilation of country singers.
4,Primarily a military history,"This is primarily a history of the various and confusing wars in the Stuart/Cromwell era rather tha the political or religious issues. The book's greatest strength is the way it connects the events in the three kingdoms -- England, Ireland, and Scotland --which is essential to see the overall picture in a confusing time. This Royle does well. I would have liked more discussion of the religious issues and a bit less on the battle details, but otherwise a fine history."
5,Puerto Rico: Off The Beaten Path,"If you're planning a trip to PR and you are interested in being more adventuresome than lying on the beach in San Juan, this book is a great resource. It covers several different trip options around the island. Had I not purchased it we would have never made it to the parts of the island which we did and would have had a far less enjoyable vacation. Also the restaurants that were hi-lighted were extremely helpful in making the trip more enjoyable."
2,not helpful at all as a guidebook,"In general, I like to avoid touristy spots, and bought this book in the hope that it would recommend places to visit. The format of this book is like a long essay, which makes it difficult to read, and not very useful as a guidebook. It goes something like: ""if you take this street, first you'll pass this restaurant, which some people like for the chicken, and then this museum, etc"" without giving definitive recommendations and must-sees for the tourist with limited time. I'm glad that my boyfriend brought a Fodor's, which was pretty comprehensive. But the best part of our trip was at an ecolodge that was very much off the beaten path (45 min on a narrow dirt road, up into the El Yunque rainforest), which I found by doing good old web research (search ""elena el yunque"")."
5,A7EA51,This dvd is so amazing you cant stop watching it i just got heavens venom cd and it blew my mind anything by these boys will rock you socks off TRUST ME
5,Refreshing,"As a parent and educator, this album is very refreshing. It is positive, infomative and uplifting. As stated in the introduction it is for young and old alike. Kwanzaa for young people and everyone else , is just that. It crosses all ethnic barriers and focuses on what is important; the gift we not only give to others, but that we give to ourselves. I highly recommend this album to parents, to sit and listen with their children and to explain to them why these attributes are so important. Congratulations, on a job well done to the artists and folks at Charphelia."
5,Q&A,"This book is a transliteration of G. speaking to an audience and answering their various questions. Moving, succinct, and of course, different from his other books."
1,It is an absolute waste of time,"Mr. Gurdjieff would like to sell the idea that almost every human is a piece of trash, uncapable of anything significant in his life time, unless he is lucky enough to find a teacher (ie. Mr Gurdjieff). If you a looking for a book which conveys the idea that individual quest for higher understanding is silly, this is the one. I guess the only view offered therein if that of a closed room without windows and with the light turned off."
2,Connelly falls for techno-babble,"Michael Connelly is one of my favorite writers. I've read everything he's written, from the Harry Bosch story arc, to the one-off ""The Poet"".Chasing the Dime was a major disappointment. Connelly pulls a Michael Crichton---dropping globs of sci-fi blather to distract from a storyline. I found myself skimming or skipping the parts to deal with science--just too boring/not interesting. The bio-tech angle already seems dated.The main redeeming feature is Connelly continues building on his ""LA world""--there's some familiar characters, including Janis Langweiser, resurfacing from ""Angels Flight""."
1,Chasing Nothing...,"This novel was a great disappointment to me. It was not up to par for Michael Connelly. The plot lacked substance and depth and was slow to develop. I wasn't impressed with the characters.I have read most of the Connelly novels and loved them, but not Chasing the Dime.I hope this effort is not an indication that Connelly is starting to capitalize on his popularity and beginning to crank out a new novel every six months like James Patterson. That would be a shame."
2,I Saved This One For Last - Thankfully,"I've read all of Connelly's books (except the short stories) and I based upon reviews I waited until I didn't have any more to read before I downloaded this one. It was a struggle to finish it, and I read The Drop in one day. I suppose if you are a Connelly fan you should read it just to say you did, but don't expect it to keep you up at night. Some of the things that the ""good guy"" does are simply not believable - no one is that stupid. Oh well, waiting for the next Bosch book."
3,regarding Henry,"Henry's on the verge of the deal of a lifetime, worth more than the dime taped to his wall. But he's had to move to a new apartment, and boy, did he get the wrong number on his new phone! Michael Connelly has devised a terrific plot, and we're still in SoCal, but Henry is no Harry (Bosch). He's a scientist, not a detective. Although the back story is a poignant one, serving as his motivation for his uncharacteristic curiosity about the previous owner of that phone number, the way he becomes involved in the disappearance of the sexy LA Darling Lilly is, well, just plain dumb. Henry also lacks Bosch's depth and humanity, and though decently written, Dime's strong plot simply cannot carry the day by itself. The character with the most presence is the odious villain little Billy Wentz. Still, a so-so mystery by Connelly is better than the best shot taken by many another, less gifted writer. 3 stars."
2,Chasing the Fast Buck,"What a disappointment! I am a huge Connelley fan, I eagerly anticipate each new book. The last time he deviated from the Bosch or McCaleb genre with Void Moon it was a great stand alone change of pace.Not so in this case. This book never gets off the dime! The characters are weak and thinly drawn. The dialogue is missing Connelley's usual crisp punch. This is an intriguing premise for a story line and one can only imagine what Connelley could have done with it if he had applied half the effort he puts into a Bosch novel.If you want a book that takes no effort to read and a story that neatly wraps up in the last few pages, give this a try just don't expect the exquisitely plotted stories we have come to expect from Connelley."
2,CHASING THE BUCK,"I have read all of Connelly's books and I hope that Chasing The Dime is not the first Michael Connelly book you read. Pick up The Poet to see how Connelly writes when he is interested in his characters. This story feels forced, the characters are shallow and take actions inconsistent with their shallowness. Overall a boring read by a writer who showed so much much talent in his early books. Maybe if he went back to chasing the dime instead of the big bucks he'd regain his tralent."
4,He's no Harry Bosch........,"Good Samaritan's should be smart........this one ain't! If this were a true story, it would be a major miracle that he survived and continued his life. At least Jack McEvoy was smarter than this!"
3,Not His Best,"Besides the Harry Bosch mysteries, I don't think Michael Connelly's been at his top form since ""Void Moon"". This book is on par with ""A Darkness More Than Night"" for a so so plot line that never becomes very compelling. It was also the first time I've been aware of the author laying track for a pay off later in the book. To his credit there are some twists that keep you off the trail of who might being doing what to Henry Pierce, but I wasn't overly engaged. The niftiest bit of plotting was to tie Pierce's sister to Connelly's book ""The Concrete Blonde"" I also felt that some of the characters seemed two demensional at best, the tough talking gumshoe detective, the seedy porno kingpin. It's not a bad a bad book. It's just, I felt, not what Connelly is capable of delivering"
1,Terrible disappointment,"I usually love Michael Connelly and was thrilled to see he had another book out. ... It was boring, the characters were [bad], and I didn't care enough to get through 50 pages. I tried skipping ahead but it never got any better. ..."
2,A Disappointment,"This is the first book I've read of Michael Connelly's and I can only take the word of other reviewers that his other books are far better. I hope so because I intend to read them, but quite frankly, this book was boring for the first 3/4ths and the last part although it had a few moments did not compensate for the rest. A weak story line. I didn't care about or believe the main character. And ditto others who have said the ending was rushed, phoned in, and too neatly wrapped."
1,a dud,"Boring, predictable, unbelievable (say people who did not sell yet their first startup usually have no money to burn), artificially constructed, these problems are so annoying that I was not able to finish it."
2,A poorly written page turner,"""Chasing the Dime""... By page 86, I believe I counted at least eight references to the title. I guess the author wanted a reason to call this book ""Chasing the Dime"".""Chasing the Dime"", admittedly, is fast paced and holds the reader. But it's a lightweight piece of junk, and after reading it you'll feel the way you do when you cram down a half bucket of KFC. I have never read any of the author's other books, and after this one I won't be looking for more."
2,A put downable epic,"I started this book at Osan Air Base in Korea in August, put it down zillions of times, but finished in Jacksonville, Florida. Harry Pierce does dumb things for no perceptible reason. Connelly must have been half asleep when he wrote this thing. I'll wait for the next one, it can't be as bad as this one."
1,Unbelievable,I have read all of Michael Connelly's books and have enjoyed them all....until this one. It is so unbelievable I can hardly believe it was written by Connelly. Skip this one but read the others.
2,What a dud!,"I am a big fan of Michael Connelley's. He usually writes about very bright police officers. I do not know why he wandered so far away from familiar territory, but he has managed to create a character -- Henry Pierce -- who may be a genius, but is also unbelievably stupid. I cannot accept the reasons that he tries to learn about a missing escort simply because he was given her former phone number. He not only puts his life at risk but his entire company and the careers of his associates. I was so disappointed in Henry Pierce that I began to side with those who wanted to arrest him or kill him. That might have been the most satisfying ending. I won't give up on Michael Connelley -- books he wrote since Chasing the Dime were better, including one that moved into the courtroom. However, I will no longer assume that his name on the dustjacket insures a great read."
4,"Improbable, but still good","This is a wild book and a real departure from Connelly in that it doesn't use his usual and reliable cast of extremely well-written characters. This is a ""standalone"" book that starts with a simple premise involving a new cell phone and somebody else's voice mail and leads through the worlds of high technology, escort services, cut-throat (i.e., kill for it) competition and back again. It is a gripping ride and you won't believe the twists (actually, this isn't entirely a good thing)."
5,"Missed Harry Bosch, BUT......","Outstanding story, complete and vivid and typical of Connelly's style. I still prefer a book about Harry, but this was as good a departure as The Poet and Bloodwork.....Keep 'em coming!"
3,Not Michael's best but passed the time,I love Mr. Connelly's books but I couldn't identify with the character so it was difficult to stay connected. That being said I have everything he has ever written in one form or another.
3,Techno-Thriller - Entertaining but Overly Complex,"In an attempt to create drama, I think the author built in too many subplots and story lines. It would have been sufficient to tell the story of industrial espionage and sabotage, and keep the personal dramas to a minimium. If you enjoy the whole shebang, this ought to please you. I enjoyed both the plot and personal dramas, but I can understand people who got lost, lost interest, or gave up. The basic plot is right out of the headlines, and should be of interest and concern to us all."
2,Don't Even Chase A Nickel,"This is a departure from the hardboiled world of Harry Bosch and also from the world of believable storylines. Here we have a guy who is so totally driven by his work that his relationship with his girlfriend has disintegrated. He is so focussed on his company that he's brought it to the brink of one of the greatest breakthroughs in history. Yet that focus and drive can be diverted because he gets a few phone calls that were meant for someone else!Huh!?!I'm sorry, the premise for this is just a little too out-there for my liking."
2,Not up to his usual par,"Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors, but this book wasn't up to his usual standards. The characters were two dimensional and the story just didn't grab me. This book is just not realistic and although it's a quick read, it is not a good read...I await the next Harry Bosch..."
3,Chasing a Movie Contract,"Disappointing Connelly work - not worthy of his earlier novels. This book reads from page one like a screenplay: action, action, action - very little character development. Mr. Connelly must have been very excited by Clint Eastwook playing one of his characters from Bloodwork so now it seems his work will really just be step one before we see it on screen. By doing this, the book lacks depth and style and the story is silly anyway."
1,Cruise Control,"I have enjoyed all of Connelly's work to this point. Chasing the Dime seems like a book that was written because he had to fullfil a contract. The book lacked character development. The reasons given for our heroes obsession are never explained completely, and the only other character in the book worth a hoot (the detective), disappears and suddenly rears his head without explanation. The book moves along fairly well but is jumpy and disconnected in parts. I think Connelly wrote this without involvement of his talent and, it seems, to make a buck off of his previous works reputation. Another one like this and he will be joining the ranks of other authors who begin to rely on their early reputations to sell mediocare efforts."
4,consistent and gripping,"I'm a die-hard Connelly fan--I've read all of his novels and short stories. Harry Bosch novels are my favorites, but all of his work is excellent. 'Chasing the Dime' is good stuff, full or twists and turns. I especially enjoyed how Connelly wove Dr Seuss into this one. Worth reading, for sure."
3,Not Connelly's usual A-game,"So far I've read half a dozen of Connelly's Mickey Haller and Harry Bosch series -- all of which were fantastic -- and was eager to read something of his outside of that universe. I found that ""Chasing the Dime"" lacked the character and plot development and fluidity that make his other books so great. Specifically, I didn't buy Henry's motivation for risking his entire life's work to chase down a random call girl. For being such a genius, the guy makes some inane decisions. I also thought that the ending was abrupt and smacked of a deus ex machina. I won't go into details that'll ruin the surprise, but I felt as though I might have missed an entire chapter where Henry redeems himself. In all, the story just wasn't put together as seamlessly as MC's other books. All of that said, I still think he's a great writer and I'm definitely going to keep reading him."
2,Avoiding the Dime,"The novel is shallow and just a bit too farfetched. It isn't a bad read but don't expect anything at a higher level than the average romance novel. Not that this is a romance novel, it isn't. Throughout the entire book it is simply very difficult to suspend one's disbelief. The premise is okay and might have worked if the execution wasn't so lazy. This is one of the few books in recent memory that I am sorry I purchased and it has definitely turned me off to Connelly. On the flip side, if you can get your best friend to loan you a copy and you are really bored on a dreary Sunday afternoon, go for it. Otherwise, skip it and find yourself something by Jonathan Kellerman (or his wife)."
2,Read Connelly's Other Works,"I found the plot didn't make much sense and for the first time (in reading Connelly) wishing for the book to be over already. Suggestion: don't judge Connelly's works by this book, read the Harry Bosch series instead. They're wonderful."
1,Bring Back Bosch,"Wussy science nerd looks for missing prostitute in his guilt trip over slain sister. Connelly strikes out badly in this ""who cares"" plot involving molecular computing and the sex-for-hire internet underworld. Ending is predictable and leaves this Connelly fan waiting for Heronymous' return."
2,And your point was . . . ?,"A friend lent me this book, and I just don't know why. I didn't buy the premise, found the characters unsympathetic, and was waiting for someone to grab the protagonist by the shoulders and tell him to get a grip. This is my first encounter with Michael Connelly. It would have been my last, but after reading some other comments, I think I'll try a book that features Harry Bosch. I'd also encourage other first-time Connelly readers maybe to do the same and avoid this one."
4,Fantastic Voyage,"Michael Connelly's standalones are always exceptional. CHASING THE DIME is in the same class as THE POET, a must read. The subject is right out of today's headlines, headlines in SCIENCE or NATURE, that is. Connelly's protagonist is in the midst of the nanotechnology revolution and, as usual, the money on the table leads to blood on the floor. And on the bed. And in a storage locker.This is very close to perfect, with a few key exceptions. The plot turns on two expectations: that an inventor/scientist named Henry can be a crime fiction hero and that he will have a sense of curiosity so hypertrophied that it will lead him to take unconscionable risks at just those points in his life when he has everything--both romantic and financial--to lose. Both of these expectations are a stretch.The plotting, however, is superb, the subject fascinating, the pacing state-of-the-art. Suspend your disbelief and come along for the ride."
1,insultingly stupid plot,"Henry is supposedly a brilliant scientist on the brink of a major professional triumph. We're supposed to believe he's so unhinged by his girlfriend's dumping him, that when he sees a prostitute's photo on a website, he gets obsessed with her fate, morphs into an amateur detective, cleverly obtains private info about her from people who don't want to give it, breaks into her house, reads her mail, talks with her mother on the phone.....it isn't believable for an instant. And if the guy really did behave this way, he's an idiot, and who cares what happens to him. Skip this one, Connelly's worst book by far."
5,a modern noir classic,"Michael Connely's latest novel ""Chasing the Dime"" is in some ways a clear departure from his Harry Bosch series, in other ways it continues his journey in spinning a web of noir tales around modern day LA. His latest hero is a naive scientist drawn into an unbelievable nightmare by investigating what happened to the woman whose phone number he inherited. Henry Pierce lives in the sheltered subculture of a high tech start-up, a whiz kid with an unusual past. Part of that past draws him to look for Lilly, the prostitute who must have previously owned his phone number and is still getting calls from numerous men every day. Pierce soon descends into the dark world of internet porn and finds himself not only distracted from his regular pursuits but in grave danger.Connelly masterfully keeps this book at an unstoppable pace while once again creating a dense atmosphere and believable character setting that will not let you put this one down until the last page is turned."
2,"Don't gone soft on yourself as John Grisham, Sir.","What is this? What has become of this author since the lousy Void Moon, or even earlier, the Trunk Music? The writing is obviously downhilled since then. First was the once great author, Stuart Wood, after his Palindrome, then came the okay guy, John Grisham. Was fame and wealth so corrosive to an author's pen, imagination and creativity? Now, these once great writers are writing like James Patterson with a deadbeat formatted formula. They have become book factories, the products are deteriorating with very bad quality control, all they consider might just the quantity instead. I'm very sorry for them and myself, loosing grips on both ends."
1,Save Your Dime,I'm a huge Michael Connelly fan. This is certainly his weakest effort. The characters aren't believable. The plot does not flow. Drama is lacking. Give this one a pass.
3,Good solid novel,"Good solid novel by Connelly. When Henry Pierce move to a new apartment and starts to get calls for Lily, who from the nature of the calls is a hooker, he becomes obsessed with finding out why she isn't answering her calls. The trail leads him to the dark and vicious world of pornography where he is out of his depth. He soon finds that there is more to his adventure than he thought and that not only is his business threatened but his life as well. He begins to suspect everyone and doesn't know where to turn.In the end though a nice twist brings a satisfying conclusion to a real page turner.One of Connelly's better books. 3/5"
3,sherylval,"I've enjoyed all of michael connelly's books, especially the Bosch books and I thought the Poet was fantastic. While I enjoyed reading this book, I too agree, that this is by far not his best book. However, evidenced by this one, even a bad Connelly book is better than most of the thriller fare."
3,Not His Best but Good,"I almost didn't read this book because of the other reviews but thought I'd give it a chance because Hey, it's Michael Connelly. Although I agree it's not his ""Best"" work, I do think it's worth the read. I've read much worse that's for sure. Caught me by surprise in several areas."
2,I agree with others - his books are usually much better,"doesn't match up to past works, especially Harry Bosch - for the first time reading his work (and I think I've read them all), I was very disappointed at the end, and felt like I wasted my time."
3,up and down,"I like Micheal Connelly writing, but this one had too many slow(down) parts and not enough up (exciting) ones as his other books."
1,"SAME SONG, THOUSANDTH VERSE","How can anyone keep reading these novels is beyond my understanding. Connelly has two or three stories he tells over, just slightly different characters but the same old violence and hohum story telling."
4,Recommended,"I liked this one a lot. I like that it is a story that is possible and what an ordinary citizen rather than a cop or detective would have done in this situation. This is the 4th Connelly book I've read, and I have to say that I am a fan now. Looking forward to reading the others."
2,Chasing the Dime,I'm a BIG fan of Michael Connelley's but was very disappointed in this book -- the plot is so implausible. I didnt' even read it through -just cut to the end to make some sense of it-if that is possible.
3,Where did THIS come from?,"I've read all of Michael Connelly's previous books. They are excellent. His story lines are extremely engaging; his mastery of detail builds a fine foundation; and his character development is compelling, with plenty of depth and breadth. Sorry to say this one is not up to his usual standards. I almost felt like it was a formulaic response to some procrastinated contract agreement. It isn't terrible. If you need to escape in a book for a few hours, this one will do. It's just nowhere near the quality I'd come to expect from Michael Connelly."
2,Big Disappointment,"As a huge fan of the author, I naively thought he was incapable of producing a ""turkey"". Wrong (""Oh yeah, big time""-V.P. Cheney). The plot was ridiculous, the protagonist wholly unsympathetic, and the story-as goofy as it was-took forever to get rolling. I'll still be in line to buy the next Harry Bosch novel, but I hope Michael Connelly's editor reads some of these reviews."
4,Fun Read,"Maybe the negative reviews are from die-hard Harry Bosch fans. Granted, the catalyst for the plot was unrealistic. But the book moved quickly and was a fun read."
4,Overwhelming Forward Momentum on Narrative,"This was a guilty pleasure, a perfect weekend reading. I couldn't put the paper book down.Connelly, seemingly an undisciplined writer, has a gift for the narrative that's utterly captivating.The reason I opine that he's undisciplined is his near-constant use of ""like"" as a subordinate conjunction [""It looked like (sic) she was outright crying now."" p. 210], the idiotic use of ""clip"" for magazine in a semi-auto pistol (p. 401), and even a discombobulated sentence. Here it is on P 3: ""People who [sic] he would want to be able to reach him at any time, almost all of them business associates or business associates he also considered friends.""Having said this, Connelly is now on my short list of writers to look to when in need of a fun, fictional romp. This was my first book of his, which I picked up at the dump for no charge, the front cover having been ripped off.What a wonderful ending, Mr. Connelly! Thank you!"
2,Easy to read but boring,"Like most of the other reviewers I have read a lot of Connelly. I think he's one of the best of his genre and some of his books have been brilliant. But this was awful. Cardboard characters and an improbable plot. It almost seemed as if he had written this book as a 1970s ""made-for-TV"" movie."
3,"Try again, Michael.","It isn't that there aren't interesting elements in Chasing the Dime-- there are. I wasn't bored, and I finished the book. I don't think that anything can make Connelly less than a strong writer.That said, the plot Connelly uses in Chasing the Dime really stretches credibility. He chose to anchor the book in an idea about human predictability and planning that seems as convoluted as a game of Mousetrap. My enjoyment of the book was hurt because I just didn't buy it. Didn't buy the main character's actions at the beginning of the book and didn't buy it when the truth was revealed at the end.While I enjoyed the tip o the hat to the Bosch novels, it could have used more of the Bosch quality.Connelly novices shouldn't start here (try Black Ice). For Connelly initiates, you'll still find it above average as an airplane book, but that's about it."
2,not what I expected,I was truly disappointed in Connelly's latest book. I wanted to read this because I've read all of his books and enjoyed every one of them. I thought the plot was ridiculous. The main character (Henry Pierce) did not appeal to me at all. He seemed so.......drab! Why is he risking his life and career for someone he's never met before??? I know it explains why in the book but I thought it was overkill. The ending was very very weak. I was kind of hoping for something spectacular to save this book but no such luck. Connelly should go back to the Harry Bosch (or even Terry McCaleb) series. I would not recommend this book if you're a Connelly fan. Boring!!
5,Chasing the Dime,"Wow, another Gem by Connelly. I hope the science in it is true....mind blowing. I kept saying to my self as I read on......to the main character.....don't do what you are going to do. Connelly really drew me into the story."
4,An interesting mystery...,"Well, it's not Harry Bosch, but nonetheless the mystery was more than enough to keep me turning pages and wanting more. The protagonist was a a little (a lot) more naive than most peope, but it wouldn't be a great story if he hadn't kept on trying to solve it. So read it already!"
3,Not a Harry Bosch novel.. What a bummer!!,"Michael Connelly is one my top five favorite authors, but this book was only slightly readable. It is not a Harry Bosch novel and does not live up to my usual expectations of Michael Connelly's writing. It is a suspense story of a nice guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. Someone close to him sets him up and you begin to suspect it about half way through the book. The mystery remains until the end of the book when the bad guy and scheme is revealed. The story flows rather well and doesn't take long to read, but it is not a book that holds your undivided attention. Michael Connelly usually does much better!!"
1,Disappointed in Michael Connelly,"I am a Michael Connelly fan. I have read every book and anxious await the release of the next. I read his books because they are light, but at the same time he does not write like a second-grader (like many popular fiction writers do). That said, this was an immature and actually silly book. I felt like my very young children could have written a more interesting and less silly (I say silly, but at times I was almost embarrassed for the writer that he thought some of the ritual antics of the characters would be amusing) book. It was unbelievable. I hope that this atrocity will not be repeated in the future!!"
1,Definite miss!,"Having read most of MConnelly's books and enjoyed them, I found this terribly disappointing and could not believe it came from the same man who has written the superb Hieronymous Bosch. The idea was good if highly improbable, but sorry, Michael, you lost the plot on this one."
2,An Early Work,"From the start, I was mystified by the poor quality of writing. I am a big fan of Connelly, having read every one of his published works. After being bowled over by ""The Fifth Witness"" I eagerly grabbed this one, which I had somehow missed. I soon became disappointed with the lame characterisation and untypical prose. All along, I had the feeling that this must have been a once rejected early work. Gradually, clues to this started popping up. In the high-tech world of the novel, nobody seemed to have wi-fi, the technology had a dated feel, there was mention of ""last year's anthrax attacks"" and so on. Finally, I found on Connelly's web site that it was from 2002. The fact that it has just surfaced should act as a warning about this one. Read at your peril!"
1,Unbelievable - in a bad way,"Like many of the other reviewers, I've read all of Connelly's other books and enjoyed them all. As a tech/finance professional, the 'suspension of dibelief' that's critical for fiction was just not possible. The whole manner in which technology was addressed, company buliding described, wealth thought to be created, etc. - just rang way too false. I felt I was reading the glitzed up dreams of technology and wealth created by a naive 9 year old boy.Stick with Bosch and McCaleb (Michael - why not bring Terry back for another go-round?)."
1,Chasing the Dime is ironic,"This book is a terrible disappointment to all of us who enjoyed Connolly's previous stories. Talk about ""chasing the dime,"" Connolly is certainly doing just that with this formulaic, flat, boring, disaster of a novel. The plot is simplistic and who cares about the nerdy premise? The characters are thin and predictable. Take the protagonist, for example, who's a super-wealthy, science-whizzbang, handsome, dashing fellow with whom all of us are familar from junk novels. Guess who the villian is: A) the hero's old pal ( also brilliant but depraved ), B) the hero's office women's issues snot or C) the hero's newest vavoom babe? Don't read this book. It's a waste of time. But if you've already got the book, give it to someone as stupid as the author thinks the rest of us are. Connolly chased my last dime with this one."
2,Please give us back Harry Bosch,"""Chasing the dime"" is definitely several orders of magnitude below Harry Bosch's novels. I struggled to finish reading it ..."
2,Michael Connelly's Latest a Pale Imitation....,"While the premise is clever, Connelly disappoints his many fans this time around. Thinly developed characters (Henry is laughable - Wentz and Six Eight embarrassingly stereotypical), a gaping hole in the plot (no explanation at all as to how Henry manages to persuade Renner that he's been set up) and too many red herrings left me feeling vaguely cheated and quite dissatisfied. Bring back Harry Bosch, please.Amazing how the journal reviews differ completely from the opinions of those who actually read the book!"
2,Not Connelly's Best Work,"Chasing the DimeI'm a big fan of Michael Connelly having read all of his novels. Unfortunately, this one falls very short when compared to his other works.(..)There are two main problems with this book caused by the use of two overused literary clichés. First, everything that happens is built around the real culprit knowing exactly what Henry is going to do every step of the way. (Many of us don't even know what we're going to do ourselves half the time.) Second, the plot also uses what I like to call the ""Stupid Cop Syndrome"". This is where a police detective is so focused in on the hero as being a criminal, that he ignores all logic or common sense in developing the case. (Like Henry nearly being beaten to death.)Connelly has written a number of very good books, but the last few have not been up to his prior standards. ""Chasing the Dime"" isn't the worst book around, but there are so many books out there that are so much better."
2,dime is dumb,"First book by Connelly I have not enjoyed. Whole plot is a bit unbelievable and ""our hero"" is the problem. Book gets a bit tiresome real quick. Save your dime and buy something else."
2,A vast disappointment,"I had enjoyed all of the previous Connelly novels I'd read, so was very disappointed in this seemingly half-hearted effort from the author. Even Connelly seems less than enthusiastic in the writing, and the reader can hardly blame him."
5,One Of Connelly's best!,"Reading some of his other works I enjoyed them but this book was the best I have read. Now not to say his other works are dull they are increadably well written and I recomend every one of them. However, This novel introduces a new character and grabs you from the start. It develops so well and pulls you through everything Pierce is going through. I got so involved in this book I had the hardest time sitting through class because I could not wait to read what happens next. No matter what happens you are drawn to the plot and wrapped up in the story. I enjoyed this book and recomend it to anyone who loves to be fooled and surprised. Not just for Connelly readers but a book for anyone who loves a great page turner."
1,I think he must have been...,"...Chasing the Dollar to write this book. I dragged myself just past the 100-page mark in this 308-page novel before tossing it. I have read all of Michael Connelly's books and have liked every one of them. I can imagine rereading them all when I'm on the nursing home porch. But if you gave me this novel without an author's name, I would never have guessed Michael Connelly.It is unfortunate that my first Michael Connelly review is negative, so just take my first paragraph as how I really feel about this author. He is one of the great authors in this genre and I advise you to pick up any one of his other books. You'll love it.If you've already read them all, I would recommend reading more reviews here before buying this book."
2,What happened?,This from someone who has written some of the best mysteries I have ever read? I have never disliked a main character as much as I did this one. He should have had stupid written on his forehead! Please stay with the police mysteries that you do so well Micheal!
1,Did Connelly Really WriteThis?,"As with most people who have read Connelly's other books, I was really looking forward to his newest. Unfortuneatly, the characters are shallow and uninteresting while the story is so absurd that it made me mad for wasting my time reading it. The ending comes out of nowhere, with no explanation how people ended up in the last scene, and why. Although by then, I couldn't have cared less! What a waste of talent."
2,Major disappointment,"Having been a big fan of all Michael Connelly's previous books and especially of Harry Bosch, I had a difficult time believing that Chasing the Dime was written by the same author...weak plot, boring characters, and Henry Pierce never came alive. In fact, from now on I plan to check Connelly's books out at the library before investing in one."
1,extremely disappointing,Storyline was silly. Poorly written. Riding on coattails of previous bestsellers.
3,Chasing the Dime,"After City of Bones this was a bit of a let down. Kind of a slow start although the concept of the computer / internet pimp was a good one.Picks up nicely in the middle and then ""slam bam thank you mam"" ending al la Periot. Everything tied up neatly with a bow. Not very satisfying.Could have been paced much better and could have used a little more fleshing out of the characters in the book. This book could have used about 50 more pages to be a good read"
2,Not up to Connelly's usual standards,"There were a lot of things about this book that I found irritating - the title, the contrived plot, the relationship with his ex-girlfriend, the fact that a computer genius that uses dial-up...stick with the Harry Bosch series."
1,I want my dime(s) back.,"I was really looking forward to reading this book by Connelly. I've been forcing myself to finish it in hopes I could overlook the obvious character flaws of the main character, but alas, I'm abandoning it in hopes he comes to his senses before his immaturity gets him ...well, I won't give the plot away. Actually, the plot started out well and with every turn of the page disolved. However, it worked better than Valium to help me sleep."
4,Science and sex make great suspense,"Not having read the ""Bosch"" stories, I didn't know what to expect from a Connelly book but Chasing the Dime was a fun and pleasing book to read. The story is centered around the main characters research firm working on nano-technology development. However, he gets lured into chasing a memory from the past that could ruin his future. The story ends up centered more around on-line prostitution, murder and haunting memories than science and what nano-technology holds in store for us (see Prey) but it keeps the story moving and enticing. The story ends with somewhat of a surprise, but not too surprising if you piece it all together.While Bosch fans might be disappointed, most readers will enjoy Chasing the Dime."
4,Just to have fun,"The story of the book is completely out of reality, if you have a new phone number and all the calls are for a broad, the only thing you will do is to change that number as soon as you can, it doesn't matter if you had a sibling with the same problem, but if you want to help her and you find the mob I'm sure you will go away. Nonetheless you will have a good time reading it if you don't expect much of the story, maybe you can take this book to the beach and read it there."
1,Read Prior or Subsequent Connelly Books,"When a fictional character does something dumb I usually have one of two reactions. I buy into it and let the story move on or I don't buy into and I keep thinking about the dumb thing instead of the storytelling. It was the latter that held true for me in this book.The protagonist motivations were just not believeable to me and I just could not get into this world that Connelly created.And truth be told, I was expecting a Harry Bosche book not a Henry Pierce tale. But that was only because I skimmed (I only read the dust cover after I finish the book) the dust cover and mistakenly confused the two simular names. However, after chapter 3, I realized Detective Bosche was not going to make an appearence in this story."
2,weak effort for Connelly,"It pains me to say this, because I'm a huge Michael Connelly fan, but ""Chasing the Dime"" just doesn't cut it. There are two major problems. First, the protagonist - a research scientist - makes decisions that are consistently silly and illogical to the max. (Think ""The 3 Stooges,"" or the two idiots in the ""Dumb and Dumber"" film, for example; unfortunately, this book is not intended to be humorous.) There are a number of turning points where, if he does only what anyone with an IQ over, say, 80, would do, the story is over. Second, this same protagonist is a manipulative, compulsive liar...not exactly an endearing trait for the character the reader is supposed to care about. In short, Connelly has created an unlikable protagonist who stupidly gets himself into one completely preventable crisis after another. Very disappointing novel. Also, very puzzling, considering that Connelly is undoubtedly one of the best mystery writers working today."
3,"For A Smart Guy, Hank Is Pretty Stupid","I thought using a character related to a character from a previous novel was a nice touch, but otherwise this book is too implausible and/or downright silly. Seems like Mr Connelly took a page (a bad page) from James Patterson and just churned one out here. Maybe he has not recovered from the loss of Harry Bosch."
2,Much better than the Northwest Airline travel magazine,"Connelly leaves the world of Lehane and Vachss and slides into the write-by-number realm usually populated by less talented hacks. The characters are straight off the writers' rack: techno-friend, hero with a painful past and hooker with a decent heart. The plot does turn, but so do the plots of most paperback thrillers I see in airport bookstores. The book isn't bad ... it's just nothing special. I can't remember ever thinking that about one of Connelly's books."
3,Henry Pierce is no Harry Bosch,"This is not Michael Connelly at his best, but for a quick & reasonably entertaining read, its better than most. Repeating what others have already noted, the character development is noticably weak in this story, & that has always been Connelly's strength. However, if you're a fan of his writing, as I am, this will keep you going until the next Harry Bosch."
2,Disappoints,"I have been a fan of Michael Connelly since his book, The Concrete Blonde. The Harry Bosch novels have always been my favorites, but his other books have been good too. This was the first book of Connelly's that I didn't like. The main character, Henry Pierce didn't grab me and his actions just didn't seem natural. The plot was fairly interesting, but in the end, seemed forced. Chasing The Dime disappoints."
1,Shame on these famous authors !!!,"""Chasing the Dime"" is SO bad ... a high school student could've written it for homework. Poorly written, cardboard characters, etc., ad nauseum ...Where's the depth, passion and skill of MC's yesterdays? Why do so many authors who only have ""X"" amount of good books ""in them"" continue to write anyway - milking their laurels, while we, literally, pay the price?Connelly is at the top of my [...] - alongside Grisham, Grafton, Turow, Crais, White, Lescroarte, Buffa, and Parker (with his Sunny Randall series).At a local book signing, Lescroarte proudly announced he had written his new book in a matter of weeks. Believe me, it showed. Are all the ""big names"" doing this?Personally, I'd rather they retire altogether than waste another dime on any of them."
3,"Interesting in parts, but not the author's best","Summary:A wealthy scientist-turned-entrepreneur moves into a new apartment and becomes interested in the identity of the previous owner of his new phone number, who turns out to be an online call girl. He slowly gets sucked into a web of intrigue as it turns out that she's missing, and finally finds himself framed for her murder by corporate enemies.The Good and the Bad:A big part of Connelly's appeal involve the police procedurals and the character of Harry Bosch, two key elements that are missing from this novel. It flows fairly well, but the setup turns out to have been predicated on an unlikely ability to predict the main character's actions, and I wasn't buying. The pacing was good, and it was kind of neat to see a rich character apply his resources to the type of problem that Bosch usually faces, but still a weak effort for Connelly."
2,chasing the dumb,"In CHASING THE DIME, Connelly has committed one of the cardinal sins of popular fiction-- creating a character who is too dumb to make the right choices. How can a reader sympathize with a character who makes one stupid decision after another? I constantly found myself thinking, ""No, don't do that,"" or ""Just leave well enough alone."" Hell, even Forrest Gump was able to learn from his experiences. Another major flaw is the main character's motivation-- why jeopardize his career at a critical juncture to find a woman he doesn't even know? Basically what is lacking is adequate psychological depth that would give this novel some real weight.Other complaints: 1) There are way too many references to ""chasing the dime"" in the first quarter of the novel, 2) female characters and hit men are not Connelly's strong point, 3) the ending left some unanswered questions, and 4) everyone walks in at just the right moment to bring this novel to a tidy conclusion. A very unsatisfying read."
2,Wait for Harry Bosch to come back,"My husband bought this book in an airport (very expensive) because he has loved the Harry Bosch books and I have liked them. He gave up on this book half way through and gave it to me because I'll read anything. I got all the way through (with lots of skimming). This book makes no sense. Maybe there is enough trauma in Pierce's life to explain his very nearly throwing away his life's work for what, at first, appears to be nothing, but his background isn't developed enough to explain it (saying it doesn't make it so or understandable) and there is certainly no explanation for his continuing and repeated stupidity. This book is WAY worse than Void Moon. Luckily, it looks like Harry Bosch is back next time."
3,OK,I am a Michael Connely fan and have been for years. This book was just an okay effort and I think him capable of far better writing. I'll wait for the next one
1,Has Connelly lost his touch since he moved to Florida?,"I was distressed to see Connelly has moved from LA to Florida! What's up with that? Chasing the Dime is not up to his former thrillers...it's hokey. First of all, I didn't find the plot line plausible and I didn't like any of the characters, especially the protagonist, Henry. What an unsympathetic, whiny guy! I hope this doesn't mean the end of Harry Bosch. Am also curious as to what's going on in the author's life that he would write such a voyeristic, prurient, ill-contrived, silly book about a guy you just don't care about. I would love to hear from other readers in this column. In the meantime, I'm rereading my Bosch's."
4,A story that will keep you on the edge of your seat!,"I really enjoyed this one. Connelly keeps us guessing and shows a solid grasp of technology. The hacker, like many of his characters, drew me in. Connelly's a master at characterization and this story shows it. No disappointments. I thoroughly got into the story and could not put the book down."
4,Connelly's characters are readily identifiable and linger long after you've finished reading.,"How do you capitalize on your previous job experience? You write about it!Michael Connelly books have mesmerized readers with his working knowledgeof the California Law Enforcement community. Not even some of his main characters are saved from the evil that lurks there. My thoguht is: If once you delve into his world of characters, and you don't find yourself fully engaged, you might want to check your sanity."
4,A page turning Thriller,"Devoting most of his time and energy to ""chasing the dime"", developing his own business, Henry is taken aback when his relationship with his live in girlfriend goes south. After moving into a new apartment, he starts getting calls for a Lilly, someone he is totally unfamiliar with. Connelly sets his intriguing mystery around these strange but alluring phone calls.Henry's life gets complicated when he becomes a suspect in the murder investigation of Lilly. This is definitely a page turning thriller."
2,"Weak plot, uncharacteristicly bad writing",My title says it all. Connelly must have had to chase a deadline or something!
3,I'm a big fan but This is His Worst Book,"Connelly is the real deal. Great writer. I've read every book and although this one is still very readable, it is my least favorite."
5,"Perfect crema, excellent froth","I didn't know what perfect crema was until I bought this machine but after 3 or 4 tries, I was getting it. The froth for capuccino is excellent and only took 1 or 2 tries to get that down. Only problem I had was after being away for 4 days, I couldn't get the froth despite thoroughly cleaning all the apparati 3 times. Then I turned on the frother and shot hot water through the frothing tube by turning on the coffee maker (the frother overrides the coffee maker if they are both on). This cleaned out whatever was causing the problem and it's been perfect since. At least every second time that I use the machine I do this for a few seconds. For the money ($200), I would give this machine 6 stars. It even comes with a video instruction disk."
2,It Broke!,"I was a little put off because it was complicated, and wasn't ""dripless"" as promised. But then after a couple of months, the steamer stopped steaming. It would start, and then just stop. The shop said I left it ON one too many times and burned out the Steam toggle switch. It was in the shop for months waiting for a part from Italy. They finally fitted it with something else and I took it home, but no luck. I'm going to throw it away and start again."
3,Gaggia Carezza,Instruction booklet is pretty meager. Water reservoir is awkward to fill and position. Front tray is flimsy and doesn't fit well onto machine. First one didn't work and had to be sent back. Customer service was excellent.Second one makes pretty good expresso.
5,"Ridiculous value, despite tacky appearance","This machine makes just about the best espresso two hundred bucks can buy. That value comes with some drawbacks, though, including the ugly plastic exterior and poor design, including a tiny drop tray and inconveniently positioned frother. But the Carezza more than compensates for those flaws with the quality of its boiler--the same one used on many more expensive Gaggia machines--and sturdy, commercial-grade portafilter. The included ""turbo frother"" steam wand attachment and rubber ""crema enhancer"" are useless. The Carezza is a little finicky about the grind of the beans, but with the right grind it produces amazing espresso."
2,Not impressed yet,"After weeks of research for a new espresso machine I decided on the Gaggia Carezza. I have yet to be impressed. I read the brief manual, watched the CD on my computer and turned it on. It is extremely LOUD. The thing rattles and shakes across the counter too. The filter holder does not slide in smoothly especially if you use the perfect crema disk. The ""perfect"" crema disc is far from perfect - it doesn't allow the stainless steel filter to fit correctly in the holder. After using the machine a few time the steam knob became stripped. I'm ready to trade it in. Another thing I do not like about this machine is you can only make one drink at a time. You have to cool down the pump to continue making espresso - long process if you are making more than one drink."
5,this will be my downfall,"Got mine today! Unpacked, ran some blank runs through to get everything lubed up and hot. Made my first weee cuppas and... they sucked. I musta tamped waay to hard and just got nastyness. Then I read their manual and messed around with how hard I was tamping the grinds and voila! crema without their silly crema disk! If you see me shaking in the streets 5 years from now help a man out and give me enough beans for a double shot...Update---After several months, the above review isn't super useful. Get a good burr grinder, good tamp, practice, [...], throw away the perfect foamy disk, throw away the bottom 1 piece of the milk foaming wand, make microfoam now. Enjoy..."
2,plastic toy,"don't waste your time with this machine. you'll spend hours trying to get a decent expresso- sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. after about a month of useage, it will start leaking like crazy."
2,The equivalent of Drip Coffee for $250,"We were so unimpressed by this machine. With such good reviews - we waited 2 months for this backordered item to ship.5 days after we received it, we sent it back to Amazon for a refund (very good Customer Service). We read the manual. We watched the Video. We practiced. We tinkered with the grind and tamp. With various beans. Single Vs Double. What we ended up with was the equivalent of expensive Drip Coffee.We re-commissioned our old $50 Capresso Machine (perfect crema every time) and are completely satisfied. The grass isn't always greener..."
4,Not to bad,I bought this for my wife because she loves coffee. She has used it a bunch and loves it. the only reason i didn't give it five stars is because some of the pieces were scrached.
2,Disapointed,"I was very disapointed. The design is cheap looking and flatly did not look good sitting in my kitchen. Big and plastic. The engineering aspect was also weak. The wand is way to low to get a cup underneath. If I tamped the coffee a little to firmly there wasn't enough pressure to force water through the filter and it would plug.With that said, it did make a fine cup of espresso. Definately a step up from anything I have had. Guess I am going to have to bite the bullet and spend a few more $$ for something else.Although I had to deal with someone in India, Amazon has been very helpful in making my return easy.Jerry in Calif"
4,Gaggia Carezza,"This machine works great, but there is only enough room for an espresso cup. I prefer more to drink, and would like to see it set to take at least 6oz. cup. Granted if you are making a larger cup of espresso coffee it is going to be a little deluted, but it is far better than a drip or press. The look and size of the machine works great. It is sleek and designed well for use. The parts are all easy to use and convienent. I highly recommend this for home or office. It's quick, sleek, easy to use and the price is right! Makes a great cup of espresso or capuccino."
4,Good Stuff!,"I'm a low income person, so I saved to buy this item. I spent awhial reading instructions, and wish they were more clear, but when I figured it out it worked perfect, and I really love it. Its simple to use and it makes great Latee's. Im so glad I spent my money on a good machine, and not on one of those cheep ones that you can buy at retail stores."
4,Overall great except...........,"The machine is great overall, but you must have to buy a certain mug to fit under the spout where the coffee comes out cause nothing I have fits under it. Also, the milk frother is fairly low so not many mugs fit under that as well. I wish I would have known this before. I guess it is one of those products that you have to buy all of ""their"" accessories too."
4,Amzing for the price,I bought this machine for my bf as a gift. At first it seemed a little complicated to figure out where all the parts go but once we got it going we were amazed.It makes a wonderful expresso (we buy beans from caribou coffee). The milk frother is great. Makes perfect smooth froth.I highly recomend this machine to anyone who wants to have a coffee shop in their home.
1,Don't buy it,"This machine has terrible quality control. The distributor nozzles (at the bottom of the metal cup) are not metal - they're plastic, AND the plastic was not properly formed from the factory, so I had to create openings with a hot screwdriver to allow both nozzles to work.Two brews later, it stops producing at all. The pump buzzes, but nothing comes out. Not good, as in USELESS.Brewing good coffee is something I expect from Gaggia. In this case, they do not deliver.Now let's see how good Amazon's return policy is."
2,Don't buy. Very noisy and no crema,"The pump is very noisy on this machine.You must use its special crema device to have creamy foam. But, you can not use it on the double shot filter and the crema is not perfect. I'm looking for another machine."
1,Terrible,"Do not buy this machine. Terrible Plastic and a motor that makes lots of noice. It can explode any day.I am from Europe and know about espresso machines.Now I live in the Caribbean and it is no use to send it back. Costly.I do not use it any more.Rene van Nie, Aruba."
2,weak pump and leaks,"I need an espresso maker that'll work with finely ground espresso. This one doesn't, and it leaks. Enough said."
3,Great starter Machine,Makes a decent cup of espresso. Has a bit of a leak out-of-the-box for me but does fine.
2,"Great espresso, bad machine","Got this, set it up, made espresso. Tasted Great!!!BUT--Less than a week after I received this machine the knob on top for frothing the milk melted! The inside threads stripped and I had to use a wrench to turn the frother off. After several weeks they did send a (free)replacement. But the post the knob sits still on got very very hot and I suspected this would have happened again, so I took the knob off until just before I needed to froth. That sort of worked.Okay, so that was an annoying problem. Then, less than two months after I began using it, it simply stopped working. It would not heat up. The heating element burned out. I assume my earlier melted-knob problem might have been caused by the heating element over-heating and that's why it burned itself out. But the mfr. told me I left it on too long and that's why it burned out and they would not fix it. So I now have a $250 paperweight sitting on my garage floor.Get something else. Great coffee, but very unreliable."
4,Melted knob but still good,"I still will recommend this product even though the plastic frothing knob melted the first time I used it. Yes, I followed their directions. Be warned to make sure the frothing knob turns freely before powering up the first time since the brass stem gets VERY HOT and can melt the knob. My knob turned and turned but I didnt know it was turning nothing since it melted and I thought the frother was broken. This is a design flaw since a more heat-resistent plastic should have been used. Gaggia reps said they will send a new one so I hope they keep their word. Other than that noise is not a big deal since it lasts about 20 seconds and I don't hear it when I am drinking the coffee. ;) Froth is nice too after you figure the best technique."
5,"Easy to use, easy to clean","I've used other espresso makers in this price range and there is no comparison. This baby produces the same quality espresso as an industrial sized espresso maker. About half of every shot is delicious crema. I think the best feature is the steamer nozzle. There is no need to use a needle to clean the holes in the steamer nozzle. I just remove the nozzle cover, rinse it off, wipe any milk spray off of the stem with a sponge or wet cloth, and return the nozzle cover. I bought this model for my husband two years ago and after heavy use it is still going strong. I recently moved (divorce) and bought the exact same model for my new home. Unbelievably good value for your money. Buy it."
5,I can't imagine a better machine for under $200.,"This machine produces better crema than I've seen anywhere in real life. If you're going to buy a more expensive machine make sure you need to make espresso for more than a handful of people, or want adjustable tempurature gauges and a cup heating feature. Otherwise save your money, buy this machine, and get a really solid burr grinder, since you'll find that having the right grind is even more important than the machine you're using."
1,Not what you expect,"I expected a standard message board (white board) with maybe an icon of Spongebob on it. Nothing fancy - but something to hang in the kitchen and leave the occasional message on. HOWEVER, it is cheaply made and very flimsy unfortunately - like paperboard. I was going to give it to my friend for Christmas, but am embarrassed to do so. It will probably sit in the box because it isn't worth returning."

3,The movie was better,"I got the book because I loved the movie, and we all know that nine times out of ten the book will be better than the movie. This is one of those tenth times."
3,"Flawed Engineering, Bad Website",There is an engineering problem with the sets ability to process remote signals. The remote isn't reliable. Everyone I know who has bought this TV has this same problem. The TV buzzes loudly while in standby. The display has minor fixed point noise. Otherwise a pretty good set if you can get it at a good price.Their website listed support and marketing emails addresses that bounced. Their support fained ignorance about the problems and their product manager didn't return phone calls.
1,Gone in 1 year,"I have bought this product for 2004 Christmas. Vertical lines started appear by 2005 Christmas, and the picture is very much distorted. Unfortunately, this happened right after 1 year warranty period. I have called the customer service who told me that it may be the panel problem which may cost $1000 (when new ones are going for starting from $850). I will not recommend this product."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV,"I bought this tv 2 years ago and the picture has gone out on it already. I have sound but no picture. Sceptre has told me I would probably need a new power inverter which would cost me $250.00 to have it fixed and that possibly that might not fix the problem. I see no reason for a tv that is supposed to be of this caliber to go out in only 2 years. They did respond to me quickly via email and by phone but this is totally unsatisfactory and they acted like it was normal. Do not buy this tv, it is definitely not worth the money. Buy another brand."
2,Proprietary Remote not Compatible,"I've had this unit for 3 1/2 years with no problems except the remote issue that is built in. A a good price and 3 1/2 years of service warrant a couple stars but....I was attempting to have a simple TV viewing experience in our den - simple enough for my wife to operate with one remote. I had purchased a Tivo/DVD so hoped that the Tivo controller would control everything - it should have! After buying the SCEPTRE I learned that they have a proprietary remote control signal format that is incompatible with any other manufacturers remote, including the expensive 'universal' remotes and, of course, our Tivo remote.Grrr - we now have one remote for the SCEPTRE that is only used for on/off and volume. Everything else is through the TIVO remote. Why manufacturers intentionally make operating their equipment with remotes a frustrating 'science' project is beyond me."
1,Sceptre NagaIII HDTV,"This TV did not make it to it's warranty date. Unfortunately, the cost to transport it to be repaired was more than it would cost to replace the item. This company does not allow parts to be transported to local repairmen to fix this item which is why it ended up in the dumpster. I bought a new 42"" LG from Sears to replace it. The LG is still running like a champ with no problems.Make sure, when you buy a high-end item, that your warranty covers in-house repair and/or replacement.I'll never buy a Sceptre again. Amen."
1,RIP OFF SCAM DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"No where does it state this is just a few pieces to connect, advertised as a full playset like the picture. when you get the sad 40lb box, it's just connectors in a TINY box and full bull****!This pathetic excuse for a company should be out of business and off amazon for fraud and false advertising.There is no lumber, no slide, no climbing pieces, no swings, no pieces to ANYTHING-- all items seen CAN BE PURCHASED additionally ALL for ALL additional pricing...EVEN the frkn WOOD!!!! No one from the company responds to the FRAUD.You have to fill a a-z guarantee with AMAZON and wait another two weeks after your return to dispute this crap.I was refunded WAY LESS than my purchase price-not even what I paid.Yo haVE TO ENSURE the box isn't written on or they can't rip off the next custoemr!I did not agree to purchase this crap box from this rip off scam company ""ANT"".They intentionally refunded less than what was due.[...]"
1,This is a Scam,"This is a scam and it is false advertising, buyer beware. Playground swing sets do not cost $221, read the item description very carefully. If you want a playset like the one in the picture plan on spending an extra $1000 in addition to the $221. The slide is an extra expense, the lumber is extra, the screws are extra, and so on. All you get for you $221 is a box full of useless junk. Do not buy this product. Shame on Amazon for letting them scam the consumers!"
1,Scam!!!,I never bother to write reviews but even though I new I was not getting the lumber I thought I was getting all parts to construct a set. Not worth the price!!! I can get a setting set (lumber included) at toys r us for this price. Don't order you will regret it and you don't get all your money back!!!
4,Edwin Star,"It is dificult to rate this cd as one unit, becaues they are bothso dramatically different.""War&Peace;"" is a waist of time. There are nothing but fillers on here. ""War"" and ""Adios Senorita"" are the only cutswith any energy. ""Time"", the other single, is a feble attempt to copythe style of Norman Whitfield. The arrangements are horrible and bland.Involved"" was one of the final collaborations between Norman Whitfieldand Barrett Strong. That lp is worth the purchase of this cd. Edwin'sversion of ""Ball of confusoin"", with the excellent backing of theUndisputed Truth, is laid back and intense. ""Stop the War"" has alwaysbeen more on the money than the single ""War"". They deleted ""Way overthere"", which is a good thing, because it had no busines being therein the first place. The two bonus cuts I could also have done without.They should have included""You've got my soul on fire"" and ""take me clearfrom here"". If you like classic Norman Whitfield you'll like ""Involved"""
3,the good and bad,The Involved portion of this CD is fantastic. Edwin Starr was way ahead of his time. The War and Peace portion is very weak. Except for the song War (which was included in both the LP versions) the others songs from the War and Peace portion just don't fit the theme. These two alblums really should not have been combined. They both have entirely different moods. One focuses on social commentary and the other just sits there (after the first song)
5,Second Yamaha recorder and love it!,"After 2years with my previous Yamaha drive and quite happy with it I was determined to find a newer faster Yamaha. The main reason for me sticking with the Yamaha brand was the Yamaha customer service. During the initial installation of my 1st drive I found them to invaluable. I didn't have any trouble with this drive at all. I will say that the increased speed I picked up on my new drive was money well spent , especially considering I payed more for a slower drive that was not rewritable 2 years ago. I know there are less expensive drives on the market but nothing is worth the fustration of poor or no service department. That has been the main reason I shop at amazon.com! Thanks"
4,Johnny poster review,"Timely delivery, but the packaging was damaged a little so the poster was bent, but still in pretty good condition. Other than that it was a quick and easy purchase"
5,Poetry Of The Future,This book forces your brain to take action! It is impossible to even equate it with the passive pastoral most people associate with poetry. It is poetry for thrill-seekers and soul-searchers.
4,Like being there,"I anxiously awaited this book's delivery, as I was at ASU during the setting of this story. Art does a great job capturing the time period and stirring memories of my old stomping grounds. If you were not there at the time, you may have a difficult time relating the story. If you were there, you will enjoy a walk down memory lane. I will give Art credit for giving really descript picture and sense of being on stage and playing in a band.It a quick, easy read and fun."
4,Nice!,"Love this ring! I bought it with the skeleton hand ring and this one is just as awesome. It is big so if you like dainty this is not the ring for you. Probably more directed towards men, but I love it. It is very unique and took me a while to find anything like it. This is the only place I found a ring like it."
2,"Descriptions are great, answer key has some errors.....","The descriptions of how to answer the questions are excellent. The types of questions are completely appropriate to the NMTA. However, the answer key has a number of errors in it, it will have you questioning both your sanity and your ability to add two numbers together. Rest assured, you are the one who is correct. I can't believe the editors of a test prep book made so many basic skills errors themselves. I scored very, very well on the actual test, but using this study guide really shook my confidence since I couldn't understand why I was getting so many easy questions wrong. Just something to keep in mind if you need to use this book!"
2,NMTA (REA)-The Best Test Prep,"This book is good to have as an overview of what will be on the test, however, you cannot rely on it alone to study. There are many errors in the key, therefore I spent a great deal of time on the internet verifying information to make sure I wasn't making mistakes."
3,TECHNICAL REVIEW,"Yet another transfer from an LP.This one had 50 Hz hum so I guess it was made from a Phillips UK pressing of an American album that originally was issued on the Smash label which was a subsidiary of Mercury records.Extremely bad noise reduction which kills the reverb tails and high frequencies with the added bonus of an expander which creates an unantural jumping out of the sound.I believe this is the only CD version available. When put up against the actual Smash vinyl, its pretty pale, but like I said, there is no other CD version readily available so its actually not a bad deal in that respect."
3,Soul rarity,"Early R&B; curiosity, 1964 one-off by the singer from James Brown show.How does it sound? Well,like James Brown with gritty ,soulful and passionate voice that roars against recognizable horn-and-sax driven arrangements. Unfortunately music is quite generic and not very memorable (songs are all bluesy ballads with crescendo finale) so unless you are 1960s R&B; fan,you won't find any treasures here.Etta James and Tina Turner both recorded at the very same time and had much better luck with material,this recording sounds like Brown was simply experimenting to see what else he can do besides singing,composing and leading the band.Very last song ""Baby,baby,baby"" (duet with Bobby Byrd) kicks with rhythm and sadly points at missed opportunity - the whole album could have been joyous like this but chance was wasted on agonizing ballads and embarrassing version of ""Tennessee Waltz"".Good - but not above average in a decade rich with exceptional talents."
1,Incorrect listing!,"Yes, as stated, this is for an X9, not an X0. Once you add it to your cart, it changes. The X0 gets 5 stars, though."
2,Poor customer service,The DVD is fine. The customer service was not. WIll never use this seller again.Within 10 minutes I contacted the seller to say my church has also just bought all of the Nooma Series. The seeler would not allow me to cancel. ALL of the others did.
5,Souljazz rocks!,"This is a killer album... It covers a lot of ground, from funk to afrobeat to straight up jazz, but it holds together nicely. If you like bands like Poets of Rhythm, Antibalas, Nostalgia 77, or 70s Herbie Hancock you'll definetely dig these guys. If you can't get it on Amazon you can find it on CD Baby (www.cdbaby.com)"
4,"Blues to die for, my reviewv from Barcelona (hard good Blues","Leslie West is a good hard Blues guitarist and vocal and really I like him much in spite of his hardness because I prefer the classic Blues than the actual riotous hard driving Blues although there are a lot of good Blues in there. This record `Blues to die for' is full of covers absolutely very good performed with a magnificient guitar and a vocal that sometimes remember me one of the most greats and one of the CHICAGO BLUES sound's creators `HOWLIN' WOLF'.Really I don't know which is the best song because all of them are very good but ""Don't start me talking"", ""Mean Mistreater"",""Why I sing the Blues"",""I'm Ready"", the sempiternal ""Talk to your dughter"" and 'Boom Boom' versions likes me very much.I recommend this record to all Blues followers, very good guitar, very good songs and very good vocals, I give it 4 stars."
3,blues died,"Leslie West did his best, a little weak, fine for the meak,There is better out there, short of a six pack maybe just a beer."
1,Highly disappointing,"Brief flashes of the Leslie West I remember, occasional glimpses of his blues prowess. But the satisfying moments on this disc are too few and too far between. I rate it ""a complete waste of money""."
4,This will smoke your shorts,"Whatever ""it"" is, Mountain man Leslie West still has it. There's some seriously kickin guitar work here to go along with Leslie ""sound of pure evil"" vocals. I don't understand why he's not getting the same exposure as other supposed guitar heroes. Labels should be beating down his door and offering him the chance to rip it up in the studio every month without fail. Blues fans should be worshipping at the alter of the Great Not As Fatsby. Virgins should be dancing and the little children laughing and playing in the streets. This is the blues, baby!"
5,Gloriously Disturbed,"This is The Blues baby.If your Mom and Dad brought you to the concert now is the time to tell them to go on home 'cuz we gonna kick out the jams, disturb your mind and kick your ass with The Blues.Long-neck bottles, sly-looking women, cars that go faster than they look - and Leslie West is eyeballing your mama - so you better ante up and keep your cards close to your vest 'cuz - Baby! ...this IS the blooze!"
4,Freedom in The Village Review,E.Lynn Harris' Freedom in the Village' as always is an excellent read. A Chance to acknowledge al the contributions of many Black Gay Writers.
5,I would recommond it,Best jacket I ever purchased. Get alot of good comments about my jacket. The rain just rolls off of this jacket it doesn't soak in.
1,cant even belive it,wrong size and has a holeim not even trying to waste my money sending this back i dont reccomend a site that gives you the wrong size zero stars
5,Excellent,"This was a great buy! My boyfriend is 6'5"" and has to buy tall. The jacket fits perfectly and is worn every day. Holds up well in the weather too!"
5,Awesome Jacket,"Carhartt makes an awesome jacket. Great for casual use in the winter or for construction. This is my third jacket by carhartt, all this style. My previous jacket lasted me 8 years without a problem, I just out grew it. Super warm and durable."
5,Got my moneys worth,I am familiar with Carhartt jackets so I knew that the quality would be first rate. I needed a Tall size to fit properly and local Sporting Goods Stores do not carry the Tall size so I looked to the internet and Amazon. I found a very good price on the jacket and the ordering and delivery was efficient and quick. This was a great way to go if you know with certainty the size and the product you are looking for!
5,love it...'nuff said,get it a little big.it will shrink the first time you wash it.plan on getting a hoodless version for the spring.
2,Oversized,This item ships over sized when compared to similar XL sizes of other manufacturers. Tried on different models from Carhartt in a shop and they fit accurately. XL for this particular one should perhaps be tagged as 2XL. Quality is great so can't complain on manufacturing defects.
2,heavy-handed,"Too heavy-handed for my taste, and what's with the equally heavy-handed dark image of Ms. Weber in that hat? Calling 911 for a makeover, pronto!"
4,"fascinating stuff, I guess.","Unless you know everything, you're bound to learn something from this book!"
3,No adhesive. Does not stick.,I need to use electric tape because there is sticky side. In correct description. I noticed someone has already commented on it but I did not read.
4,Japanese edition of the album,"This is the japanese edition of the _Missing Period_ album. Unlike most other japanese releases, this one doesn't have any extra tracks (which wouldn't make sense, anyway, considering this is an album of a prehistoric period of the band)."
3,Nabokov's Pushkin,"Nabokov and Pushkin are among my favorite authors, both having an excellent command of the language, the media, and the art. But Nabokov's Pushkin is too literal to be any good. James Falen's trans. is far superior, perhaps the best, and it's worth while to read the very best Pushkin. Ironically, Nabokov was fretted that anyone other than his son would ever translate his words; I think Pushkin would have felt the same if he saw Nabokov's translation of his masterpiece. Falen, while also literal, also is metered and rhymes. Nabokov's thuds. Read Nabokov's great novels (Pnin, Lolita, King Queen & Knave, Bend Sinister, Invitation to a Beheading, Despair, etc.) but leave Pushkin to Falen, not Nabokov."
4,New to DC...,"I just moved down to DC, and this book has been incredibly helpful. When I initially decided to move down, I purchased Mike Livingstone's Newcomer's Handbook, which was incredibly helpful, as it gave in-depth descriptions of the neighborhoods (an invaluable resource in deciding where to live), but the book lacked good maps to navigate by. NFT features great maps of the neighborhoods, but little other descriptions, which has made it an invaluable resource, once you were familiar with the basics of the area (metro stops, education, night life, etc.). I have found it very helpful for finding grocery stores, navigate myself towards the metro, banks, and others. I would recommend this to any newcomer to DC! (But only 4 stars because it is not an exhaustive resource)."
5,Awesome Book,"This is the book to get for anything concerning making creative books. From artsy books to making your own unique scrapbook, this is a great resource to give you a new idea or a new twist to your paper crafts."
4,Well done book about creating a new scrapbook,"I had hoped it would go into commercial techniques for book binding, but Cover to Cover focuses on making one-of-a-kind scrapbook and specialty bindings. It is clearly illustrated and well done for its purpose. More of an ""art"" book for the hobbiest."
5,Fantastic Book!!,I was fairly new to bookbinding when I purchased this book-and it has really expanded my knowledge of bookbinding. It has wonderful and inspiring photos throughout the book.I would highly recommend this to anyone.
2,Book Review,"The book seemed like it was in good condition till I turned to look at the back cover. It appeared as if someone had poked into (more like stabbed) the book with a sharp object and this affected several pages. So it was damaged. I am not sure if this happened during shipping, but it was disappointing. Other than this, it was in average condition for what it was worth or the cost."
4,Excellent game during it's time.,"I have had Journeyman Project Turbo for a long time, and I've always enjoyed playing it.-This game also works on Windows 2000 with service pack 3!I've tried it on Windows 2000 and still works with no flaws."
2,High hopes - dashed by CD title,"I bought this game because I loved the Journeyman Project game when I was younger. Unfortunately, one of the game disks was mislabeled. This stopped me from even being able to install the game. Given that it was inexpensive, I didn't even bother to contact the seller. Clearly the labeling issue was something from the game manufacturer/publisher, not the seller."
5,A must own for any avid computer gamer,"Ever since the original Journeyman Project came out several years ago, I had been hooked. The first game was awesome. Time travel and interactivity. The second game gained more interest for me b/c it had to do with history on earth and hooked me on DaVincci. Also live actors in parts of it and the entire game looked awesome. Many words can describe the third one. Great acting, great special effects, clever puzzles and the mythical places that so many believe exitsted.If you like a great and immersive storyline, puzzles (easier than most in Myst) and adventure type games, this is for you. If you sit around playing First Person view shoot 'em ups and nothing else, you may not like it. But it is a change of pace and actually allows you to utilize your brain for once. ;)"
3,Made excellent latte but didn't last,I loved it for the ease of use and my latte was as good as Starbucks. I used lowfat milk with excellent results and lots of foam. I was really sorry when it stoped working exactly one year after purchase. It's not a cheap equipment so I expected it to last longer.
2,Gaggia 87003,This Gaggia 87003 espresso machine made good espresso and frothed milk for about 18 months. It then quit delivering hot water and steam and must be replaced. Maintenance became an increasing nightmare over the months.I will carefully review reviews in future!
5,Wonderful family show,"Wondwrful show from the ""Golden Days"" of television. Good clean fun, wonderfully talented actors. Bea Benaderet is a great actress, who died way too soon. Funny show without using sex, violence, cruelty, political correctness, and anything else that passes for entertainment these days. If you enjoy a nice, clean, funny show from a by-gone era then this is for you. Hopefully, all 7 seasons will be available for purchase soon.If good clean television isn't your forte, don't watch the show or waste time making a mean spirited, un-called for review."
5,fun to watch,"Petticoat Junction brings back memories of programming when it was simple, innocent and not complicated. The whole family enjoys it."
4,REST STILL OFFERED AT SHADY REST,"YOU CAN REST EASY WATCHING PJ WITH YOUR KIDS, GRANDKIDS, PASTOR, PETS, AND ANYONE ELSE WHO IS SICK OF THE CURRENT TRASH ON TV. THE JO'S ARE STILL SWEET AND UNCLE JOE IS STILL A LOVABLE RASCAL. LEVEL-HEADED KATE, THE EVER-HELPFUL CHARLEY, GOOFY FLOYD, STORE MAN DRUCKER, AND DOG MAKE FOR WONDERFUL ENTERTAINMENT ALL THESE YEARS LATER. ONE DRAWBACK -- THE EPISODES SEEM TO END ABRUPTLY. WERE TAGS LEFT OFF?? OTHERWISE, LET'S MAKE RESERVATIONS TO RELEASE SEASONS 3 & 4 TOO!"
5,Best mathematical QM book,"H S Green's book is by far the best text that teaches the requisite mathematics of QM. Most other books try to break even with abstract theory and strange experiments that introductory QM appears as. This book does not go into justifying results and provide philosophical or practical explanations of QM. Rather, it succinctly deals out the raw mathematics of QM. I almost liken it to Sakurai's. But this one is marked by pithy. After mastering this text, a reading of Liboff, Shankar or Cohen-Tanoudji etc. will provide a student with an extremely strong basis for tackling with advanced QM. I reckon this as a requisite for Graduate students working with QM."
3,Public Speaking Teacher Finally Finds a Good Text,"Speak Out! is the first text for middle school public speaking I've reveiwed that is worthy of purchasing a class set. It focuses mainly on debate and developing critical thinking skills, but there's a lot more. While its title accurately reflects it's geared toward public speaking, this could be used effectively in any middle school course where logical thinking execises are desired. As a teacher in my 20th year, I have never used a text in my public speaking classes because I've found them to be heavy in theory (middle schooler word for boring) while lacking in practicality. I'm glad to say the drought is over - I only wish this had come out years ago."
4,Student-Friendly Book,"This book has enabled me to use a student-friendly text to teach not only public speaking, but also research skills and logical thinking. I use it in my public speaking course and my social studies class. The exercises can be adapted to any subject. A big plus is that it builds on the natural argumentative nature of middle schoolers. This is the only book I've found aimed towards the middle school student."
1,strange,it takes a long time to listen to all 3 discs. in about the beginning of the 2nd CD I get bored of it and do something else. I have only listened through the whole thing once. Pretty pathetic huh?
4,Humorous and Thought-Provoking,"Although Floyd Kemske jokes about being an obscure novelist, it is truly a shame that his pioneering books about downsizing, corporate cold-bloodedness and wacky HR policies are not more widely known. ""Human Resources"" possesses enough wit to entertain and challenge as it draws the reader into the ultimate in predatory workplaces. Lovers of Dilbert and corporate skeptics will enjoy the acid penned approach and even some HR types will smile at his depiction of an anti-personnel department. Kemske is somewhat of an acquired taste, but he is well worth your time."
2,Human Puppets,"I found the characters in this novel to be rather flat. They seemed not to care about anything or anyone around them, and didn't inpsire me to care about them either. It came to a half-hearted flat conclusion as well, with no reprucussions for anyone."
4,Great for Book Clubs!,"""We are all Welcome Here""' created many mixed emotions for me. One minute I was thoroughly enjoying it, the next found it a bit gloomy. One thing is for sure, this novel would be great for a book club discussion. There are many topics to discuss based on the lives of the four main characters and there are several things I learned about being and caring for a person that is also handicapped. The ending was a bit ""cheesy"", however, I do believe that even if in some small way, this book will impact me."
5,I loved this book,"I truly loved this book. If it has a flaw, it's that it ended too soon. The story was too short, Paige and Diana had lots of things left to do."
2,Disappointed,"I love Elizabeth Berg. I have written every book she has ever written. This one was not good. The characters werer there, the potential for a really good plot was there -- but it didn't work. It seemed like it was all just smushed together and given a schamltzy ending so the book could go to market. Really disappointed."
2,Not my favorite Berg book!,I think the only reason I finished this book was because I was on a 6 hour plane ride. Not my kind of book. Seemed very depressing. I like character studies but this one just did not have enough happen in it. The reason it gets 2 stars is because of Berg's other books.
2,"POLIO, CIVIL RIGHTS AND ELVIS TOO ....WOW","I think this is what happens to gifted writers when they sign binding contracts with their publishers to get a certain amount of books written and ready for market in a given time. Miss Berg has given many pleasurable reading hours but, IF you are short on money yet, still feel the need to read this disappointing novel ....borrow it from the free library and wait for something better to fill your shelves .She was given a good idea from true life and mucked it up like a bad soap opera . sorry fans ."
2,"Amazing story, but not an amazing book","I LOVE Elizabeth Berg. While this book was not her best, the story of the people about whom this was written was really amazing. I just felt the book was boring, and I think it lacked Berg's wonderful prose and poetry on life. I think she made one reference to life being like fabric on a sewing machine, slipping out of your fingers, or something like that. I always love her comparisons like that, and this book did not contain much where I said ""Wow - she is SO right!"" I also don't like books from a child's point of view. I'm 41 and want to read from a woman's point of view.If this is your first Elizabeth Berg book, do yourself a favor and go read something older by her. She really is wonderful, and I look forward to her next novel."
2,Even Elvis is Welcome Here,"I'm one of Elizabeth Berg's biggest fans, have been since Durable Goods, and have everything she's ever written. But, sad to say, look for this one on eBay soon.Elizabeth Berg is an elegant writer and I can't fault the writing in this book but the story is tough to stick with, improbable and contrived. The civil rights story line seems tacked-on and was distracting. So much in this book is implausible. I'm more than willing to suspend belief if a story is well-told and I'm really sorry to say this about Ms. Berg's work, but this one isn't. And the absurd Elvis situation is just laughable. Whatever enjoyment I got out of this book up to that point was completely overshadowed by that ending.Read Durable Goods or some of her earlier work if you want to see how talented Elizabeth Berg really is."
2,Disappointed ...,"Elizabeth Berg's books are generally to be savored, devoured and celebrated -- this latest was a major disappointment. I reserved it from my library months ahead, looked forward to the trip into another complex, rich and slighly offbeat world -- the kind that Berg creates in all of her novels. It never happened ... I just couldn't warm up to these characters, never found empathy for them ... and the ending -- just plain dumb!This one lacks on all counts. Much as Berg devotes won't want to, I'd skip it."
2,Dont judge Berg by this book,"I have been a huge Elizabeth Berg fan for several years now so when I heard she had a new book coming out, I ordered it without even reading the blurbs. Once I got the book home and I read the authors note about this being a story idea from a fan, I was intrigued to see how it would play out.Well, I am sorry to say that I think Berg tried so hard to tell the story in her own way that she might have lost the most important part, the initial idea. If the book would have just been about Paige and Diana, I think it could have had a lot of potential but Berg brought in a civil rights storyline that in my opinion did not fit and tossed Elvis in to boot.If you have never read an Elizabeth Berg book, and you did not end up liking We Are All Welcome Here, don't let it stop you from trying another. She is an amazing author and I think this one just missed the mark."
5,Her Best,This is her best work yet. I loved the story & the way it was read by the author.Kept me interested & unpredictable.
2,Just OK,I thought this one was long in getting the stroy moving along then cameto a pretty abrupt ending.
3,A nice Berg Book,"I have read most of Berg's novels and my favorites are those written from the perspective of a young girl. While this is a nice book, it is unfortunately too short (actually all of them are). I always wish I had more time to get to know that characters. I found the ending a little too sweet. I recommend Joy School or Say When for a great read."
4,Another Elizabeth Berg Triumph,"I normally cringe when I read ""Read by the Author"" on the front of a book on cassette because so many of them have no idea how to read out loud. Elizabeth Berg is a clear exception. She not only presents us with clearly delineated characters, each of them vocally fits the emotional description written by Ms. Berg. Listening to the story is a delight.The story itself is a triumph. Each character is endearing and embued with the Berg warmth. Paige is remarkably optimistic, Diana is properly rebellious, and Peacie is tolerantly loving. As I am listening, I am seeing them all in my mind and I'm happy that they have come into my life for a few delightful hours."
1,Warnings,"When i bought this item i thought that the interface for the user was one of the best that i had seen, especially for the price. However of course just as the warrantee of a year that i had expired the screen no longer works and instead now displays vertical rainbow lines. It could be that the system is not tested under the same cold temperatures as where i live. But i highly doubt that just seems like poor manufacturing. BEWARE."
4,The only problem I have is,The only problem I have is the automatic preset button is kinda big and in the middle which makes it way too easy to accidentally hit. I bought this radio from Circuit City during their going out of business sale. I love the radio and all the functionality that it has.. I can't wait to expand on what I already have for it.
3,So So,"Bought this last fall. Not bad at first. I was really happy with it. Then, I burned some mp3s and things started going wacky on thye player. Some days I would start the car and the player would play in half speed mode--sounded like a demonic force belting out my music. Also, I cant play dvd's now. The player states its a bad disk. No mechanical issues. I may have a virus of some kind causing the strange playback. DVD's worked before I put Cradle of Filth in there....Spooky."
4,A good history,"This is a good book about ideological and social change among the first generation of white settlers of a Tennessee Valley frontier county. The book relies heavily on readings of two partisan newspapers, the city-oriented, whiggish Southern Advocate vs. the rural-oriented, anti-elitist Huntsville Democrat. Dupre's attention is not confined to Madison County but wanders downstream to the Muscle Shoals as well. Good for readers interested in either this specific region or the antebellum South in general."
5,Great Cowboy Gosple music.,One of the best Cowboy Gosple artess on the mark song realy speacking to his and all Christian Pursonal and Intement Relastionship with our Lord and Saver Jesus Christ.
4,Hank Williams Gospel,I got the c.d. for my 89 year old grandmother. She has listend to it several times and anyone that comes gets to listen to it as well.It was pretty fast in coming in the mail considering it came from another continent. Thanks for bringing my grandmother so much joy.
4,Good work out dvd...but...,"I owned the two vhs tapes that had the upper & lower body Shortcut workouts, this dvd does have the same upper body workout, but the lower body workout was different, which was a bit disappointing, as I liked the vhs version better. However, that said, it's still a great workout dvd, one of my favorites by Leslie."
3,Okay..not great,"Kaplan is notoriously famous for its mistakes, and here they are again. However, Kaplan does a fair job on summarizing the information concisely. It even has some shortcuts in doing some of the calculations. However, there are many mistakes on the practice tests. After initial comparing of your answers to the books, your heart skips a couple of beats to find that you missed many problems (my experience), but not so! If you actually look at the answer explanations, when the correct answer is C, it would say some other answer although the explanation would clearly lead to that answer C. In a way it may discourage some students knowing that Kaplans is easier than the real test. I recommend this book for some extra tips a dilligent student may need, but not for its practice tests"
4,"Ok, but not spectacular","The notes are short and concise and contain everything you need to know (and perhaps a little extra stuff) for the test. However in my opinion the practice tests were not really like the real thing. There is a lack of questions on laboratory and descriptive chemistry, of which quite a lot of questions come out in the real test. Use this with a chemistry textbook to get best results."
1,Utterly confusing (and I still got an 800),"This book presents topics in a wierd order or something, because I couldn't understand it. So I gave up on it and only used it for it's practice tests which were easy."
5,good review book,There are enough information to review the things you have already knew or the things you do not learn yet.
4,Bratz Itsy City Pheobe's Spinning Cup,Our Pheobe was enamored with the idea that there was a doll in the world was named after her. She loved playing with it.
4,a good translation and a good book,"This book is very good for a number of reasons. It is funny and maliciously dark, yet at the same time shows humanity and it's weaknesses. What makes it even more interesting, though, is the translation: Idiomatic phrases like ""I knew something was up"" crop up all over the text, and though I really don't know what I am talking about, as I don't know Japanese, I can't help thinking that Howard Hibbet deserves some sort of award for such a cool translation."
5,as always.... it's a Bianchi,"Fits like a glove, like all Bianchi holsters. For my money worth twice as much as cheapo generic holster (which I have also)."
2,Low Light Output,"Purchased this for the supervisor so that it will always be charged. Good size, convenient, but puts out very little light, despite being an LED. Other battery operated small flashlights are far superior."
3,Good item to have,"Following the Hawaii earthquake and subsequent blackout, I purchased 2 of these lights to avoid having to rummage through the dark finding a flashlight. The small size, low cost, and LED light source made this a good choice. These lights are bright enough to provide emergency lighting to find flashlights and other items in the event of power disruptions and have the added benefit of a nightlight feature, which leaves the light on while plugged in at a lower brightness level. Overall we are are pleased to have these lights and feel more secure knowing we will not be caught completely in the dark."
4,"small, bright, sturdy","Rechargable flashlight is small, bright and sturdy. We keep two of them ready in our theater at all times. I like the dual power lamp settings and the long lamp / battery life. Plugs right into outlet to recharge."
3,It's OK,"This game is very easy. Only one ""puzzle"" was even remotely challenging, and this means that it took me about an hour to retrace my steps and find the object I was looking for. The graphics ARE beautiful and other game designers would be smart to use in their games the QuickTime VR technology that is found in #3 -- this makes it seem more realistic. However, I found this game very limited and a bit boring. I found myself often wanting more; the ""world"" seemed too small and limited. The characters had no personality, nor did they do anything other than their 1 given task and ""talking"" with you. The best game in the series is #2, and it is VERY good. In fact, it is one of the best games in this genre that I've ever played, although I really enjoyed Full Throttle and Curse of Monkey Island (Lucas Arts). #2 is VERY hard, but the ""walkthrough"" mode that comes with the game is entertaining."
3,"Good gameplay, so-so graphics and poor acting","The gameplay and the puzzles are just fine, if a bit confusing (but hey, if I understood everything right away, it would be too easy.) The graphics are a bit disappointing (compared to Riven and Myst 3: Exile.) The worst thing about the game is the poor acting (especially the obviously fake accents) of the people you come in contact with. The characters are shallow, unrealistic, and stereotypical.However, this is a game you play for the puzzles, and the puzzles are fun. Moving around the manipulating things is easy, which is a real plus. Overall, I recommend this game if you can get it at a good price (i.e., it's a fun game and worth your money, but not a must-play like Riven.)"
2,uncompadiable product with new computers,only buy if you have an old computer. my new computer will not play this game. must be used in legacy mode with 32 bit operating system.
2,Would have been better had it been larger,"The stickers may be larger than a postage stamp - but not by much. The 4 1/16th by 5 3/4 size quoted is the size of the actual book, and the pages hold four stickers each. For the price I suppose it's decent enough, being acid free and adhesive, but the actual reproduction leaves a little something to be desired. I was upset to find that the reproduction of Hokusai - Kingfisher, Irises and Pinks was blurry. The other included prints are:UTAMARO - The Courtesan Hinazuru at the KeizetsuroEISHO - The Courtesan MidorigiEISHI - A Beauty from the Pleasure QuarterHIROSHIGE - Asakusa Rice FieldUTAMARO - Three Beauties of High FameCHOKI - Hanaogi with MaidservantHIROSHIGE - Drum Bridge and Sunset HillHOKUSAI - Peonies and a CanaryEISUI - Somenosuke of the MatsubayaEIZAN - SnowHIROSHIGE - Maples at MamaSHUNSHO - Lovers Becoming FamiliarHIROSHIGE - Crossing the Yoroi WaterwayHOKUSAI - A Favorable Breeze and Clear WeatherHOKUSAI - Stormy Sea Off Kanagawa"
2,"FINE PHONE JUST DON""T TRY TO USE IT WITH A MAC","I bought this phone and am returning it. The features are fine. It has a video and still camera, and mp3 player. the problem is the connectivity. I bought this bluetooth phone hoping it would sync with my mac. It does not. There is one program which supposedly bridges the gap, but after dropping $300 on a phone I didn't really want to spend and extra $50 to make it work right.Other complaints I had was the keypad is awkward to type on it is recessed and the lip on the top and bottomg got in the way of typing in numbers.Also T-zones doesn't work at all I guess this is and EDGE phone but T-mobile doesn't have their EDGE netwrok set up or something like that.Generally I liked the layout of the phone. I just wish I could sync it with my mac. to me the most important function of a phone is managing contacts and right now this does not work with the t809 and a mac"
4,If size is all that matters.....,"Size was my primary focus and then current features such as mega pix camera and mp3. Have been less then wowed with some of the functionality, but would make the same purchase again. Did I mention that almost everyone makes comment and it's a great way to open conversations with people. Well, they usually initiate. Seems as if all anyone cares about these days is the size of ones equipment and how nice it looks. It feels good in the hand and people can tell how enjoyable it is to communicate with by the smile."
1,Terrible,"I bought this phone about a month ago after getting sick of my old Sony PDA phone.This phone's battery sucks. It doesnt even last 5 hrs. When I called their customer support they told me to send the battery for them to test it. Since this is the only phone I have, I didnt want to send the battery. And the supervisor told me to use the public phones. He was very arrogant and mean over the phone.I will never buy Samsung again."
2,good for everything...but connecting,"It is a great phone loaded with lots of good-to-have features. But it fails on the very basic must-have use of a phone...connecting. I have a Nokia 6010 & this one, both active with T-Mobile. The reception of Samsung t809 is far inferior to the Nokia one. In the same place, I can see 5 bars on my Nokia against one on Samsung. And this is consistent. As if that wasnt enough...if you try to connect with anything less than 3 bars, the phone just goes blank and does not connect at all. In a nutshell, you can use it for everything but making calls and receiving calls.So, overall, I would not recommend this phone to anyone, except if you are more interested in using it more as a camera or digital diary."
2,Overall good but blue tooth realy bad and static,This phone works good.Mp3 is really good. But only problems is the bluetooth.I had a sony ericson phone which the bluetooth was perfect with no static. samsung t809 is really bad in bluetooth.The looks of the phone is not that great. It does not have a voice dialling.
1,Total Waste of Time,"Has to be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for. Between the missing features (no voice dial on a $200 phone?!) crippled features (I have to buy ringtones, use their t-zone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already?) and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier. Anyone who would charge some much for this POS really doesn't deserve my business."
4,great phone. can be better,"I've had this phone for over a month now and it is a great phone. I don't have the problems some ppl have, dust in screen, short battery life (my last a whole work day, I went over 1000 daytime mins last month).this phone need to have voice dailing. the charger and headset shares the same slot, so you can't charge the phone and use the headset at the same time. i also wish mp3s can be used as caller id ringtones."
1,Nice phone but be warned....,"Very spiffy, though the menu isn't very intuitive. BUT - and this is a big BUT - if you want to use Bluetooth to connect your pda or computer to the internet, avoid this phone and/or avoid T-Mobile. T-Mobile DOES NOT support this function on this phone. I spent 5 hours on T-Mobile tech support with a tech who said the phone definitely should do this and that the fact that mine wouldn't meant the Bluetooth on my phone was not working right. But T-Mobile customer service refused to exchange the phone. They said that the only things the phone's Bluetooth will connect to are headsets and other Samsung phones. What's more, they told me they had checked with Samsung and Samsung said the same - although its website says the phone connects to computers via Bluetooth. So if that function is essential, buy another phone (asking T-mobile first to check its internal documents to make sure it supports the function) or go to another provider."
3,"Great phone, but poor service","I brought this phone with T-Mobile 600 minutes service plan under 2 year contract. The handset is simply great and I agree with the good reviews of other customers, but the coordination of Amazon.com and T-Mobile is really very bad, So if you are buying this phone from Amazon.com with T-Mobile service plan then please think twice.When I called T-mobile for activation they told that they dont have any information for me and the sim card number I mentioned was being used by some other customer. 2-days later I revieved a phone number from Amazon.com with wrong area code.Whenever you call Amazon.com they say that please contact service provider and T-mobile says that we are not aware with the terms and condition of amazon.com.Finally T-mobile sent me a new sim and my cell is working now, god know how much they charge me for this new sim."
1,Lousy Lousy Lousy,"I can't believe that with technology as advanced as it is, Samsung could produce this giant POS. It's flashy, yes. But does it deliver?? No. I actually refused to pay the bill and let them shut my service off. I loved the clarity of the pictures, even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty lousy, and I even liked the video feature. But the phone is only good IF YOU CAN USE IT!!! It's been years since I've had such lousy reception from a phone. I'm considering taking the dealer to court over this, since they pushed it on me and told me what a great phone it was. I want my money back!!!"
3,"Phone is OKAY, but for Dust","Hi,I had this phone for around a year. What I hated in this phone is that the dust gets accumulated beneath the LCD screen. The dust comes in via a small hole in the rotating camera. i checked this in many forums and almost everyone owning a t809 has this problem.i had to perform a mini-surgery (take out the lcd screen with a knife, clean it and stick it back).In the process, I did the following damages...a. a small scratch in the main screen beneath it.b. There are 4 stickers to hold the outer screen. in the process of cleaning one of them was damaged.Wondering how long that will hold, meanwhile my search for next phone is on...hope this helps.Thanks,Gopi"
1,NO MAC SUPPORT. Interface is poor.,"Frankly, the phone is next to useless if you use a Mac with OS XOther than that, its been ok."
1,What happened to 1-year contracts?,"T-mobile and amazon used to offer great service, and best of all was the option of having 1-year contracts available instead of having to be tied up with your carrier for two years. So far Verizon has 1-year plans. It is a big drawback if you're considering 2-year plans. I wonder if they are going to put it back, but for now, i'll have to wait."
3,bad battery life.,can someone suggest me which and where should i get an extra battery? oem or not? what are the pros and cons of both kinds of battery? thank u
5,One bad butt phone,"I.ve had mine now for 2 months and always get compliments wherever I go. My favorites are when I receive them from Razor owners. I love all of the features on this phone and really only had one complaint. This would be the omission of the voice dialing. With a bluetooth headset, which pair up easily with this phone, you can't see who you are calling unless you're looking at the phone.The video and mp3 functions work perfectly and you can hit the 1 key while viewing video for a full screen image. The software included with the phone has yet to be desired as some of the functions are not yet usable.But the ones that do work are fairly quick in data transferring from pc to phone and back."
1,Drops a lot of calls,"Cons:1. DROP CALLS A LOT2. phone book takes a long time to initiate after the phone was turned back on3. keypad awkward to use - too crammed together4. You cannot have ringtone and vibrate at the same time, it is either or.5. Excesssive useless botton and features such as repeated ""my music/ my photos / T-zone,"" etc.6. Samsung doesn't offer loaner phone while your phone is sent into for repairPro:1. Quality of screen is great - color and definition excellent2. Small and light-weight3. looks fancy"
2,BROKEN OUT OF THE BOX -- NO SUPPORT FROM SAMSUNG!,"I purchased a brand new Samsung t809, and right out of the box the battery cover would not stay on the phone. I went to a genuine T-Mobile retailer and after working on the phone for a good half-an-hour, they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit. The sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able to get his personal battery cover to fit. Clearly, a manufactuering defect by Samsung. I contacted Samsung for a replacement... after six weeks of hassling them over the issue, the end result was that ""the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty."" What?! End result, I get to duct tape my battery in place. Thanks. If you're going to spend serious money on a high end phone... go with a brand name that actually stands behind their product. Clearly not Samsung!"
3,cheap,"Hat arrived quickly but was mishapen & bent also the band had kinks & wrinkles. The shamrocks were also out of shape almost like someone had stretched the whole thing. It wasnt that expensive, but i was still pretty disappointed withe quality."
5,The indispensible book on the Spanish defence of Argentina in the 18th Century - vital to any understanding of events in 1806.,"It never ceases to amaze me how English-language authors think they can manage to write their own histories of the British debacle at Buenos Aires in 1806 without consulting this book, but they all, without exception do. As a result they have little idea what was going on on the Spanish side.This book gives a comprehensive history, backed by reproduced documents, of the development of the Viceroyalty of La Plata's defences in the 18th Century.Beverina is a first rate military historian of the old school who would be far more widely known in the Anglo-Saxon world had he written in English and not confined himself almost exclusively to Argentine history.I first ran into this book twenty years ago at university. I am delighted to learn, however belatedly, that the Circulo Militar has reissued it."
2,Not for those sensitive to smells,The product is probably fine for those that don't mind the smell of a new rubber mouse pad. (Yuck) It's a smell that takes forever to go away and I cannot use it until then. Currently it's being stored in a hot attic to speed up the offgassing process. I probably should have returned it. The smell is simular to the smell of new tires which make me physically ill.It takes some doing getting it on the steering wheel but it does fit on my Honda.Mary Jo
4,dig cd by boz scaggs,"scaggs best album since ""silk degrees"" in fact it is a very good approximation of the slinky, sophisticated urban r& b/ r& r/ soul hybrid scaggs perfected. recommended."
3,Missing the best song,"I bought this cd in 2001 in San Francisco. Great album. GREAT ALBUM! Best song on the album is ""Get on the Natch"" where Boz raps about taking care of yourself. Lost that cd among my last 3 or 4 moves. Bought this new one and it's a song short! Don't know what happened, but I'm very disappointed. Rest of the album is great, but The Natch is one of those songs that you tell everyone about and then it comes up missing."
1,Boz bites again,"I guess I'm getting to be an old fuddy like Boz, but this album comes nowhere close to matching the prime talent displayed on Silk Degrees. If you thought Come On Home and Some Change were cool, then you might like this disc. At least Some Change had one truly beautiful song in Sierra, but there's no tune on here to even come close to that, let alone a classic like Silk Degrees' Harbor Lights or We're All Alone. This album is instantly forgettable -- no hooks, no riffs, no soaring melodies. The only semi-memorable song is Get On The Natch, because it is so laughably inane and lame; here, Boz tries to disguise his voice as Texas geese farts.Boz traded in his silk slippers for a lounge jacket a long time ago."
5,"Thank you, Boz Man, for giving more of what we know you for!","He's done it again--good music, well written, expertly played. So far, ""Sarah,"" ""Get On The Natch,"" and ""Desire"" are the ones I like best. ""Sarah"" is perfectly sweet and romantic; ""Desire"" is sexy; ""Get on the Natch"" blends a dance beat with editorial commentary--who else can do that? ""Miss Riddle"" is pretty interesting; not too sweet, but also sexy. Don't know why they call it ""Dig,"" but I don't care. His concerts promise to be incredible with this music. If you like this CD, you will also enjoy ""Some change,"" which no one but us fans ever heard of, and you will NOT be disappointed."
2,huge disappointment,"Scaggs' Come On Home was one of the best blues and soul records of the mid 1990's, but this new release, several years in the making, is as slick and as uninteresting as the worst of his Johnny Bristol produced material in the 70's. Yes, occasionally his singing is very good; the songs and performances lack soul and fire, and there is very little lead guitar or soloing of any kind to pick up the enormous slack. Sadly, this record is for ""must have"" fans only."
5,Best Album of 2001,"Best of 2001? That may seem like hyperbole after listening once. But repeated play reveals the subtle mastery of an artist whose musical and lyrical skills have matured like a '70s Ridge Cab. And the atypical ""Get on the Natch"" is damned funny. I gave several copies of ""Dig"" to friends for Christmas, and have had nothing but rave responses. ""Come on Home"" showed that Boz can cover any Blues style, flawlessly. ""Dig"" displays more of his own style; ""Silk Degrees"" for this decade."
3,"A Long Ways From ""Home""","While I imagine this album will prove commercially successful, it is far cry from being the artistic achievement found in 97's ""Come on Home."" With only a couple truly memorable cuts, this effort lacks the creativity and authentic voice, both lyrically and musically, found in the previous work. Within terms of other music available, only average, despite the high production values. Boz' voice and inflections remain singular however, and fans of his music will probably be pleased."
4,cool sounds of the boz,"Great CD,very cool sound, but has anyone noticed a series of faint scratching sounds on one of the records best cuts ""Sarah"". Do I have a defective CD or are these sounds part of the new hip hop production techniques?"
3,Where's the real drummer boz ?,"Forget this one folks . For a good career overview - go for MY Time - Anthology (2cd) and because this double cd ends with only 1 track (Goodnight Louise) from the stunning Come On Home which i must say has a real drummer playing on it (Jim Keltner), Boz fans should not overlook this wonderful cd also."
5,vanishing point,"Glad that Boz is back since his last release ""Come on home"" in 1997. Dig isn't only a great album with superior musicianshipincluding TOTO members David Paich and Steve Lukather,who joined him through his Platin aera between 1976 and 1981, it's one of his best CD's for a long time. Favorite tracks: Vanishing point, Payday, Miss Riddle, Call that love and Thanks to you. Play it loud !"
2,Very disappointed.,"Silk Degrees and Slow Dancer remain among my favorite albums. (I am, however, so old that I refer to them as ""albums."") Accordingly, I was thrilled by the comparisons of Dig to Silk Degrees. I was, you guessed it, very disappointed. I found the songs on Dig to be almost universally unremarkable. I found Boz's voice to have retained the muted tones that made it distinct but to have lost the slight edge that prevented it from being, well, muted. Some orchestrations were interesting, but the whole thing lacked the singular style or thru-line that a singer or group needs. Truth is, I gave it two stars instead of just one for purely nostalgic reasons; its lacking made me dust off some of Boz's old stuff again."
5,Author of Everyday Miracles,Highly religous book with a profound depth of spiritually.Elevates one's mind to a high spiritual level.Insight into the and powers of an ascetic.A great write. Easy to read.
5,Taking The Scenic Route,"Looking to complete an assignment as well as to discover the heart of Buddhism, the journalist author covers a wealth of outer and inner terrain. Ultimately, he completes his National Geographic piece, but the main journey is spiritual as he discovers his own Buddha nature. This funny and interesting book blends personal experiences with Buddhist history as the author takes you on the road to enlightenment."
1,Not ready for prime time,"Doesn't do much to reduce glare. At certainangles, it reflects more light than you wouldget without the filter attached."
5,Tug-O-War,Product was received in a timely manner and was just what we were looking for. This rope will be used for activity days at our Middle School.
4,Good Espresso - Good luck with instructions,"I find the espresso that this machine makes is quite good considering the relatively low price, so thumbs up for that. However, my major complaint is that the instructions are almost incomprehensible. They are clearly, and poorly, translated directly from the mother tongue Italian. It just doesn't make any sense and you're left simply guessing. To this day I am not certain that I'm doing anything the way the designer intended, however, it works and tastes good, so hey...I'd say if you're an experienced barista you'd be OK. If now, have someone teach you or teach yourself. It's definitely not idiot-proof. My second gripe is that the steamer is a pain-in-the-A%@ to clean, yet I expect that is the case for most machines of this caliber."
5,"Celestial navigations, Capter V, The Connection",Very enjoyable CD. Have all of the CDs from them and listen to them all the time. Waiting for more.
5,Comprehensive Red Wing Reference,"This is a very comprehensive treatment of all categories of Red Wing production. Rare, seldom reviewed pieces are included. I appreciated not having to refer to an index for prices (they are provided with each listing). Nice photos. Excellent general reference for Red Wing collectors."
5,collector cute beanie babies,"i purchased this little guy to add to a small collection in my office. He is adorable!! Rather small and very soft..he is truly a baby. i only purchase ones that look special to me and very glad i got this little guy. Price was great, shipping fast."
2,very ugly,"I must say that this guy felt very cheap and his prickles were very sparse and to top it off, he was totally ugly! I mean, not that real hedgehogs are cute in real life or anything, but stuffed toys should be in my opinion, and this guy was not. Returned him right away."
5,Awesome Concept For A Sci-Fi Novel,"A friend of mine suggested this saga to me. It took me a few months to read all three books, but this was time well spent. Christopher Hinz keeps the story flowing, there aren't a hell of alot of boring parts to this saga. The story envelopes new things in each part that are just outstanding. You must read this saga if you like Science Fiction."
4,A fast-paced page turner!,"Liege Killer (as well as the rest of the saga) is an extremely gripping and well-told story. You will not be able to put the book down before you're through! It features a number of fascinating ideas. It is also, however, not much of an intellectual challenge, to put it mildly. But then, even fans of William Gibson or Isaac Asimov watch a Schwarzenegger movie every now and then, right? This saga is the closest equivalent to a Hollywood action movie I've ever encountered. I really liked it - don't miss book 2 and 3 of the Paratwa Saga, ""Ash Ock"" and ""The Paratwa""!"
2,Great Pictures...... but............,"Arguably the best photo reproduction in it's price range.... however, the user interface designers are out to lunch.. Very difficult to use with various, non-photo, paper size applications. Cannot feed 4x6 recipe cards from 4x6 tray..... gotta be a picture. removing extra, small cards from main paper tray requires fingers approximately 10 inches long and no more than 1/4 inch in diameter.. forceps are handy. Oh, yeah... just because it won't feed from the 4x6 tray doesn't mean the print doesn't go there unless you change defaults and remember to change them back... Definately suboptimized for photos... my old 700 series gets a higher overall rating... 700 was Not as good on photos but better on everything else.."
1,"Great Picture, Just waste a ton of paper to print it","Upon receiving this printer for christmas as a gift from my wife, I have found numerous others that have had problems printing with this printer. All are the same, paper jam. HP's email does not even cover the problem. Apparently there is a flaw in the printer's tray. You must receive a new printer tray from hp before you can begin to print. The original tray that came with the printer is warped. Take the tray out and set it on a level table. If it wobbles, you have a warped tray. Would not recommened this printer to my best enemy."
5,Great Printer-Easy Install-No paper Jams,I am amazed by the quality of photo and black-and-white printing by this printer. Th HP Photo Ret technology blows away pictures from the local KODAK. I was even able to install this printer from the USB device on Red Hat Linux. Do not listen to all the bad hyped reviews from Mac users either...it seems we have too many people that do not know how to differentiate between PC-MAC driver cds.
2,Don't buy if you have XP as your OS,"This printer is terrible if you're running XP. Trouble getting it to operate, problems once you do, and very little help from HP. Good luck even getting the proper drivers to download from the HP site.When it works, pic quality is great...although there are feeding problems once in awhile."
5,P1000,I have had this printer for a few months now and am very satisfied with the performance. I was looking for photo quality printing to use with my digital camera and this printer surpassed my expectations. The card reader slot is another bonus and makes printing index prints quick and easy. I have had no set up or operation problems. I hope this printer lasts a long time as I am very happy with it.
2,Mega problems getting it set up,"Bought it & tried many, many times trying to install. Got multiple error messages, but it would keep going with the installation & tell me it was installed successfully. I was able to print from several programs for short spurts at a time, but if I let the computer sit without printing for more than a half hour, or I shut down, when I came back I would have to uninstall & shut down & reinstll in order to print. I even took it back to Sears and got a new one & had similar results. All told, I have spent about 11 hours playing with it. The photos are superb. Is anyone else having these problems? I have an HPPavilion pentium II, and am connecting with a bi-directional cable. I really want to keep this printer!"
2,Nice Photos When It Works!,"I have had the HP P1000 for nearly one frustrating year. While it does print well, it has many problems. For starters, the included software would not install so I had to download software from their website (credit HP for having it available). But it has never worked flawlessly and at times tells me it cannot upload a photo to my computer because it is not connected (this right after printing from PC to printer). Additionally, there is a special photo paper tray. Nice idea but the printer doesn't align with the tray so a 4x6 photo is printed out as a 3x6 photo (top missing in a pool of ink in the printer). I have never had any home printer problems that I could not solve until I bought this one......"
4,Love this printer!!,"The photos look really great, especially if you use HP paper. It's plenty fast, and I LOVE the cancel button right on the front. I also like that I can print from the SmartCard without going through the camera. My only complaint is that the 4x6 paper feeder hangs up now and then."
3,Frustrating,"When the P1000 prints, I'm impressed! However....there are continual error messages and half printed photos that eject from the printer. For the last 5 years, I've been using the HP 560C printer without any problems. I'm going to utilize HP customer service and hope for the best or the printer is going back! Hewlett Packard, I KNOW you can do better than this!"
4,Easy to use,"I just bought this printer and I love it. I had previously bought an Epson 860, didn't like it so I returned it and bought the Epson 750 didn't like it either. And you have to use Epson paper or your photo are terrible. So I thought I would try the HP P1000 after an 1hr.1/2 in the store testing all the printers and this one impressed me. The photo's look great. I highly recommend this printer. And you don't have to use HP paper to get quality looking photos."
3,Great Printer but without PDA IRprint support,"I really loved this printer until I found out that its IRport didn't support PDA IRprinting. I was shocked and sad, the price is right and probably I would have kept it but I really needed the IR port. If you don't need the IR port for pda printing then go for it. Now I'm waiting for the price of the PhotoSmart 1215 to come down. When will it be? I don't know."
1,Don't waste your money,I purchased the first of 2 of these printers at a local store. Got it home and printed out a whole package of 4X6 prints and was delighted at the quality. Then tried to print from the regular 8 1/2 X 11 mode and the paper wouldn't feed. Took it back to the store and they replaced it. Printed more 4X6 prints and exactly 2 full size sheets and the printer again refused to feed the paper. The store refused to give me a refund - only a replacement and HP was equally unhelpful. Have since had several people tell me these printers are famous for this problem. Bought another brand photo printer that is a little slower but just as good quality and the paper ALWAYS feeds. I like HP products but will never buy another photo printer from them.
4,Produces clear colorful images. $100.00 Rebate.@Best Buy,"I just bought the Hewlett Packard Photo Smart P1000. I bought it from Best Buy at the same price and they had a special rebate of $100.00 if you purchased the Hewlett Packard Photo Smart C200 Digital Camera with the Photo Smart P1000 printer. The price of the camera was $299.99, the printer was $399.99 then take off $100.00 rebate by mail. Great Deal!"
1,near miss,"Why put in a USB port and exclude all the talented, graphically-inclined people who use Macs instead of Windows machines? I use both kinds of computers, and I need to have peripherals that are compatible with both. It's just plain shortsighted not to write the drivers for the Mac. GET WITH THE PROGRAM, H-P !!"
3,good recording but¡¡¡¡¡¡,"this recording is really good , but I have some reservations about the bassoonist , poor technical abilities and doutful intonation, why I give it 3 stars because of the pianist , very good and there is a piece for piano solo that makes this cd worthy."
3,Fast-paced and interesting plot development,"Definitely a story worthy of the Dietz name. Almost on par with his ""Legion of the Damned"" series considering it's a storyline based on civilian society rather than on military society. The action is relatively fast-paced and keeps the reader from putting the book down. However, the Il Ronn are too anthropomorhic to be believably alien and the description of their behaviour and society harkens to nothing more than humans in funny looking suits."
1,Needs a heavy dose of editing,"I just bought this title a few weeks ago. The few chapters I read through and examined so far are full of mistakes, omissions and oversights such as incomplete sketches, text not matching the diagrams it tries to describe, errors in formulas and typographic errors. A few of the methods described are cumbersome and some chapters are just plain meaningless.If there is ever to be a second edition of this book, which, granted this, serves a basic need, it better be accompanied by a really careful revision and serious editing effort."
3,It's not what you think it is....,"I got this book, read it, and wondered why it was titled the way it is. The book is a collection of essays on the cultural background of the Gospels. Some of these essays, I think, don't belong here and one is left wondering why they were put in the book in the first place...but it's still good information. I believe that it should have been edited more carefully."
3,A Modern Twist !,"Continuing the ""Live Dates"" theme, this album is a modern-day version that extends the lineage into the (almost) current era. Not as strong as Live Dates II or the original Live Dates but still a good listen. You can't fault great musicianship."
5,Convincing,As a former criminal investigator and commercial pilot the case presented here if only half true is convincing that that evidence was altered. With Wm. Jefferson Clinton (who always had a hard time with the truth) anything is possible. Interesting read and I still have some some questions... Florida Snookman
1,A poorly written book with subtle racial overtones.,"I was required to read this book for my Anthropology class.The book itself is not written by an Anthropologist.I found so many grammatical errors in the book; it became difficult for me to take it seriously.The author seems to feel some kind of hatred for white people. He writes about how all the bad things that were done to the Native Americans was done by ""the white man"". The book tries to make Americans feel guilty for something that modern Americans had nothing to do with. The book feels preachy and at times strays from the facts.I'm very disappointed with the book. I think my class could have been taught much better with a different book.This book has too many emotions and not enough facts; I could let that slide if it wasn't so poorly written and with so many punctuation and grammar errors."
5,Great quartet playing this one!,THIS IS SIMPLY REALLY GREAT STUFF! It's a refreshing combination of instruments with the vibes and piano sonorities.Terreon Gully is an artistic new and outstanding voice on the drums. This drummer's mind works in very new ways----incredible player. This is a live recording and its sound is great and the chemistry is very there!
3,A book on stupidity which should have been a bit smarter,"The aim of such a book is suppose is to provide a few laughs. I skimmed through the book looking for such laughs and bright spots. In one someone by the name of Ozzy Osborne spoke about ' losing the best part of myself when he lost his mind' I am not sure.In any case the book is filled with this kind of stuff, and worse.One might say that 'People are stupid enough without making them look more stupid'.There was often stupidity in in the choice of the examples of foolish remarks. One selection is one of the finest Kafka small parables I know, words which are not foolish at all but rather profound and illuminating.This is not in a short a particularly great collection. But if one skims long enough one will get a few smiles."
2,Uninspired and UK-centric,"This book has some real gems, but as a rule if the entry was more than a short paragraph long, it was boring and pointless. There is tons of stuff that won't do anything for you unless you're a resident of great britain. There were an amazing number of quotes to do with some McDonalds lawsuit in the UK that I had no clue about or interest in, and was very annoyed with after the umpteenth quote. Five or six quotes from royalty would have been good, but there are hundreds, and I eventually started looking to see if the source was a prince or queen, so I could skip it or get ready to groan over the pointlessness of printing yet another quote from this person."
5,This was my lowfat cooking Bible,"I purchased this book in 1994 when I was approximately 50 pounds overweight. I was just learning about lowfat eating and did not know how to prepare foods for myself and my family that we all would like. I did not want to prepare separate ""diet food"" for me and regular food for my son. However, with this book, I learned how to convert all the foods I craved, namely sweets and breads, to lowfat. My son especially loved the tortilla soup recipe, and he ate everthing I made from this book without asking ""is this diet food?""Using the principles in this book, I lost the 50 pounds and have kept them off for the past 5 years. I recommend this book for anyone who is beginning a lowfat eating regimen and needs guidance on how to start. I have bought other lowfat diet books since 1994 which are good, but this is still my favorite."
1,"Fake Food: Processed, artificial ingredients & inedible recipes","I rarely leave a review, let alone one this negative, but I can't be silent on the ""food"" this book urges you to assemble. It's disgusting. The recipes are loaded with fake and processed ingredients. (Have you ever seen margarine melting in a pan? It's gross.)The book is also misleading, blurring as it does the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats. Olive oil, inaddition to being an actual food as opposed to one with a bunch of artificial ingredients like Pam's recipes, is a healthy thing. You can cook intelligently and in a healthy way without foregoing pure, healthy ingredients.Lastly, there are many things that go into being healthy. Exercise, for instance. If ""low-fat"" were the factor Pam hypes it as, the French wouldn't have a significantly lower incidence of heart disease. (They eat triple cream brie, duck and other high-fat goodies by the pound, yet are far healthier as a group than Americans.)"
5,Learn to live low-fat with food you will actually LOVE!!,"This book is an excellant learning tool for those trying toswitch to a low fat way of eating. If your motivation is tolose weight or simply to improve your health, this is thecookbook for you.I bought this book to lose weight. P. Mycoskie helped melearn how to make a transition to low fat eating by teachingme how to read labels, choose ingredients and modify mycooking style. In the process of learning all this I havelost 100 pounds and feel great.No this is not a diet book; this book teaches you how tomake a lifestyle change that you control and can live with.The food is actually good; not at all diet food. Your kidsand husband will even eat it - mine LOVE IT!!"
2,All the Foods You Love Modified to Low-Taste,"After reading glowing reviews about this cookbook,I feel compelled to uncover the truth. This cookbook is average, at best! There are MANY other low-fat cookbooks on the market that far outshine Butter Busters. The texture and flavor of many of these recipes rarely even resemble the ""real thing."" Breads and cakes are often spongy and some recipes are over-spiced (as if the cook is trying to hide something). The whole concept of using Butter Buds in place of ALL fats just ruins the taste and flavor of many recipes. If this is your first low-fat cookbook, don't throw in the towel just yet! This is a bad first impression! Low-fat cooking CAN be delicious...Butter Busters is not."
3,Alright!,"There are some good songs on this CD that make it stand out like We're Callin' U, Love Session, Nursery Rhymes,Ebony Eyes and I Didn't Mean To but there are just as even bad songs and also some of the beats sound the same, but if you are looking for good upbeat slow songs this has it. But they are no 112 or Jagged Edge!"
4,Silk front center,"Silk is sooooo fire. Yall are out the frame and of the chain. If you a salt shaker my review will not be helpful to you. It you are a congratulater it will be helpful. Don't hate because Silk is #1, #2 is not a winner, #3 nobody remember. My favorite song is ""Don't go"". Lil G cheated on her and says he's sorry by asking for forgiveness. I believe he means it. He asks her to ""Don't Go"". ""Welcome to the Love Session"" intro gets you ready for the 12 songs that are about to be presented to you. They are all on the right notes. The album is a must buy."
1,BOOOOORING,"This album was really testing my patience. I was listening to it while driving on the highway, payed full attention and tried to find at least one track that I could get into. No luck. I think Silk managed to make this their worst Album ever... Oh And before I forget, I need to mention this: brutalizing Rick James's ""Ebony Eyes"" is something I can't forgive this easily. Like I said....I listened to the entire album once, but I will never again. Sorry, Silk!"
5,SILK,ALWAYS BEEN A BIG FAN OF SILK. CD ARRIVED ON TIME AND IT'S AN EXCELLENT CD FROM BACK IN THE DAY AND STILL IS. LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT.
2,"""Silk Lost the mix""",Silk failed to carry forward the level of talent displayed in their last CD. The lyrics appear high schoolish at times...I'm curious as to what changed from the compilation of the last CD to this one (i.e. writers and or band members).Peace
2,Not Their Best Effort,"I am a die-hard Silk Fan. I've been following them since ""Happy Days"" and ""Lose Control"" were big hits. This album goes into my ""sell or trade"" pile. ""We're Calling You"" is the best song on there, and that is not enough to keep it in my cd player. I don't know what a lot of the other reviews were listening too, but it couldn't have been this album.Save your money."
3,Silk - Love Session,"This album isn't their best. Producers Link and Delite handle most of the songs and some of them sound like their other produced hits (""I Didn't Mean To"" sounds like Gerald Levert's ""Nothin to Somethin"", with the ""Bennie and the Jets"" piano riff and all). The good news, though, is that this time, all five members get ample time to sing instead of just Lil' G and Jon-Jon. The only really good songs are ""I'm Sorry"" (which could have used some more original lyrics), ""Nursery Rhymes"" and the remake of ""Ebony Eyes"". Actually, that version outdoes the Smokey Robinson/Rick James original! Unfortunately, Silk got dropped from their label because this album went wood and Lil' G went solo. Their new album, Silktime, is not worth checking at all so if you want some vintage Silk, their Best of Silk compilation should satisfy you instead."
5,Just what the doctor ordered,I take Mag-oxide every day. It always arrives a few days after ordering so I never miss a dose. Thanks!
2,"Out, out damn spot","I bought this product, and I can't see any difference in my streaks. It exfoliated my skin nicely, but if there is any improvement in the actual streaking, it's negligible."
1,Not worth your money,I bought this product to help correct streaks caused by my careless application of Sublime Bronze spray which is a fairly good product.This corrector however was not worth the money I spent. It did nothing but irritate my skin. It is basically an exfolliant with base of Glycerin and Mineral oil. Definitely don't recommend spending your money on this.
4,Them sure ain't making movies like this none,"It is actually not a bad movie at all, sure it is full of stereotypes but somehow the story is very watchable. Kenny Rogers plays a central figure, Travis Tritt comes in as a accidental sidekick, the stolen bride is a beautiful woman, most bad guys die various bloody deaths, the story ends as expected, there is even another music watch similar to what Lee Van Cleef was carrying in one of his westerns. What else one could ask for ?What I found surprising is how well Kenny Rogers played his part, he is a good actor and it is amazing that he hasn't played in bigger/better known roles."
3,A Devil of a river,"Rio Diablo DVDA bounty hunter (Kenny Rodgers) goes after kidnappers while trying to come to grips with his past.Somewhat recommended for fans of Kenny Rodgers and Travis Tripp and Westerns.Gunner August, 2008"
2,so=so mvie,like Kenny Rogers but the movie never played so cannot give a fair rating. there were too many scratches on the dvd for me to watch it
4,Good movie,Akhay Kumar is my favourite actor with no doubts. He has done many great films but made many hideous mistakes in the 90's. His biggest mistakes were the one's in 1997 but before that things were OK. This movie Sainik(Soldiers) is based on Akshay Kumar a soldier in war with some bad terrorists and he does a great entry at the beginning. The romantic scenes and the songs were OK not as bad as what came in the year 1997 for Akshay. Then Akshay risks his life and dies after the interval and after everyone gets to know boy does the movie get damn boring with everyone cry and pretend to be happy. That's the most bad thing about this movie but at the end when Akshay who was captured by the enemy who didn't die came back and everyone was happy an OK movie better than the 1997 crap Akshay gave us.
5,A Memory of Lee,This is one of the best books about Lee! It is written from his youngest's son's point of view. It's a great book for every library.
5,An Excellent Primary Source,This was purchased for use as a gift. The recipient was a sophomore in high school and loved Civil War History.Having good primary source reading material helped his understanding.
3,The Urban Middle School has turned in to a public Arts Sch.,School Girls is about the lives of some young girls at two distinct middle schools in the SF Bay area. The Urban Middle school described by Ornstein as a school down by the freeway was painted as a sorry and plodding inner city school basically staffed by an insensitive staff of burned out teachers. While her account of 1991 conditions at the school was more or less accurate many positive changes have taken place since then at the same school. Today it is has been designated San Francisco's Middle School of the Arts and is staffed with many new an dynamic teachers. While some school girls at this new program may continue to have the same kinds of problems Ornstein described in the book they at least have a better school enviornment and a better chance for success than the SCHOOL GIRLS in the book.
1,"One-sided, inspired by a myth","This book was inspired by the AAUW report which has been shown to be a flawed and biased ""study"". This study points to poor self-esteem as the cause of poor school performance. But it does NOT tell you that black boys were found to have the HIGHEST self-esteem, but the LOWEST school performance! This book focuses on just girls, although most of problems pointed out are also experienced by boys.(Latina gangs? What about Latino gangs? Now THAT'S a problem!) This book seems to be highly ""subjective"" in form. Her suggestion that girls are afraid of giving the wrong answer to questions (hardly a girls-only issue) and hence refrain from answering questions conflicts with the opinion of the AAUW report (which inspired this book!) that suggests that girls don't answer questions so as to not appear to be too smart and aggressive! Unfortunately, this book dishonestly seeks to create another ""women's issue"" out of a TRUE ""children's issue""."
1,"Boys suffer anxiety in junior high school, too.","I agree with Susan's review. This book employs a familiar and effective--but flawed--journalistic technique to build its case. Vivid interviews with individuals of one gender at two schools are coupled with broad-brush generalizations about all girl students and all boy students at all schools. The reader is encouraged to assume that the girls suffer greater anxiety in middle school, because only girls are interviewed. A book that only reported interviews with these girls' male classmates could have built up an equally powerful picture of anxious, underachieving boys at the same schools. This is not quality reporting. Let the reader beware."
2,Well written but very one sided,"She shows how some girls do suffer drops in self esteem in Jr.High, however she thinks the solution is to make damm sure boys suffer greater drops in self esteem. She holds up as role models educators who go out of theie way to be harsh to boys. She seems to think that the fact that boys get punished and repromanded more often than girls is showing favoritism to boys (ie they are getting more attention). She thinks it is great that there is a class where boys have to act out womens roles and write essays for NOW. It never crosses her mind that adolesence could be a difficult time for both boys and girls. Far to much boy bashing but does offer some useful insites into what adolesent girls are thinking."
1,Clear prose in the service of a wretched theme.,I agree with those earlier reviewers who pointed out how harshly this book treats junior-high-school boys.
4,School girls review,"Great self-esteem builder. Slightly greeted toward younger girls but great advice for young women, too. Helps women understand the implications of pleasing others, specifically men, over themselves."
5,Fascinating and Relevant Book,"This book is an important read for anyone who ever was a girl or who ever has known a girl. It gave me much insight into the values that I was taught as about gender and also what others learned about the subject. This book is fascinating and easy to relate to. It explores the hidden curriculum we learn in school, from parents, and from the media about what it means to be male or female; who has power and who does not; who is valued and who is not. It made me see the world differently and in a more enlightened way."
2,used dvd,"I was disappointed with this dvd, there were bad spots during the movie! Joe Mantegna makes a great Spencer, but this wasn't a great movie."
5,Husband loves them,I got these for him for christmas and he loves them. Takes a bag with him to work every night. I will be ordering more!!!
3,Learning Curve Too Steep,"I have been into combat Fltsims for 10 years and have good equipment, a Dell P3-500. I loved the original SU27 but this one has me buffaloed. I have been into this game about two hours a day for the last ten days. When I lose the enemy on radar I can never find him again. Other than shooting an enemy a distance with a missile, I have lost all my fights. SU27 2.0 needs a cheat screen like some other sims have that enable the user to simplfy the radar, etc. I'm out of it until a patch is available to do that. 2.0 has a lot going for it but I don't want to make a career of finding out how to make it work. The manual offers minimal help. Rotsaruck if you buy it, unless you are more of a wizard than I am."
5,Simply The BEST!,"I got Flanker just 3 days ago, and the first impression was it was hard to fly and manage, because ofcourse i didn't read the manual. But my first impression of the game was WOW! the graphics are amazing! I have never seen graphics in sims like this with excellent frame rates. Even your enemies aircraft have moving parts! full moving control surfaces! i was amzed when i saw it..I was on a F-15 six, ready to burn him, when i got realy close, i saw his elevators move just like the real thing! Its awesome! then I read the manual, not all of it, and then went back to combat! It is beautiful! THIS IS A MUST GET!"
2,Don't waste your money,"I am disappointed in the lack of clarity in the instructions. In comparison to Falcon 4.0--this sim's main competitor--Flanker can't keep up. Flanker needs to go back to the drawing board and make this game easier to learn. Falcon has a very structured training course, and a logically written manual; this one doesn't."
2,Bore Snore...,"boy, is this guy overrated. don't believe the hype (if there is any and then it will soon go away--ohhh dissed 'em!). I was told to let the record seep in and that i would not like it right away, well i've been seeping for a whole week...and it's still bunk. if you like neutral milk hotel and palace and smog, which bright eyes gets compared to, than you will be dissapointed. it's like if you like pearl jam and then said ""i like them soooo much that i think i'll buy all the creed albums!"" bright eyes is a copy of a copy of a copy. the lyrics are like bad poetry from jeremy's (of pearl jam fame) notebook with boring melodies. it's hip but face it--it sounds like a badly produced counting crows and those felas are lame--except for that ""mr.jones"" song. that is a good song. and the lead singer dated courtney cox. and she's on that funny show ""friends"". i laugh at the show because it's funny. joey is funny. bright eyes makes me tired."
2,past the graveyard on my way to work...,"Please, this middle-class spoiled brat never had a hard day of work in his life. well, maybe thinking up new ways to write about being sad does take effort, but, c'mon. i will admit, i bought into this nonsense, but like sporting a mustache or a mullet to be ironic, i have seen the error of my ways, please people, wake up. Bright eyes is the indie rock equivalent of Ronnie James Dio, except Dio F*cking rocks.late."
4,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,"Jessie Kane's life has been turned upside down.She's learned something: she can't trust anyone anymore. She finds herself running from two armies, her best friend, and her own demons. It's a race against the clock and a fight for survival.Ms. Caldwell takes us to a world so unlike ours, but so similar at the same time. VEILED IN HUMAN FLESH is an interesting take on the battles of good vs. evil. Lines are drawn, boundaries are crossed, and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole ride. Her world building was solid, yet she still managed to use so much of today's America - Hollywood included.This was definitely a fast-paced and entertaining read.Reviewed by: Jessica Cave"
2,This book's main strength is its brevity.,"I'm a lifelong Thane fan and love the gentleness of her books and characters. But in this book, the hero and heroine--really, those terms are too strong--were barely in existence. Why would anyone love either of them? What was so special about them? Both seemed passive and cringing, and it was difficult to see why each found the other transcendant. But at least it was short. Thane's strength was in history--even in her magnificent Williamsburg series, the earlier books were better and more vivid than the contemporary volumes. This novel further illustrates that difference. And _what_ is the significance of the title?"
2,Less a melody than a finger exercise,"Given Elswyth Thane's involvement with theater, it may not be utterly unfair to suspect that this novel started life as a one-set farce and was hastily novelized. The plot makes up for its originality in featuring characters no longer dewy with youth by putting them through the paces of endless misunderstandings that could have been quickly revolved had the hero or heroine any gumption. While this novella is not the worst of Thane's literary output, it will disappoint anyone who hopes for her best."
2,the point being?,Boring. The heroine is colorless and weak and the hero drifts through life and has no backbone except when it comes to rather trivial issues. The plot is dull and fairly predictable and most of the characters are likewise. How could the same person who wrote the entertaining Williamsburg series write this book?
2,"Poorly written, totally slanted","Can't recommend this work due to the poor prose and disorganization of the author. That said, it did provide useful tidbits about the British takeover of German Tanganyika. Amazing that someone should take such a fruitful and interesting set of circumstances and make such a horrific botch of the job"
4,"Well Done, Karen Kingsbury","Back when I was driver's ed, an instructer from Mother's Against Drunk Driving came to the class and told her story. When I read this story by Kingsbury, I felt like I was reliving the story that Mother had told, only this time being able to travel on a spritual journey of forgiveness more real than I've ever read. I must admit that it's kind of hard to sit through all the bitterness that dwells on the inside of Hannah, but you can't help but understand her pain. For anyone with older teens/young adults, this would be a great book to encourage them to read. Kingsbury does an incredibly job painting the picture of a perfect family that is literally destroyed by a drunk driver. It clearly portrays the many obstacles that Hannah and her daughter must push through in order to finally begin living again. Well done Kingsbury."
5,My thoughts of Waiting For Morning,"Looking for a great book, well look no more. Waiting For Morning by Karen Kingsbury is the great book. The story begins with Hannah Ryan (Mother and Wife) waiting for her husband and children to get home from an annual camping trip. They are late as usual and Hannah is getting nervous. Little does she know they are close to being home when a man who is drunk (Brian Wesley) is speeding right towards them.Then it is to late, the other car hits them with full impact and their car was thrown and wrapped around a pole. Alicia Ryans, the oldest daughter, died instantly. The father died shortly after and the youngest daughter, Jenny, lives with a head injury and a broken arm. The police get Hannah and they go to the hospital. Later on Jenny tries to commit suicide but she lived. Brian Wesley was sentenced to 50 years n Prison. Hannah and Jenny rejoice and are happy."
4,Sad but inspiring story,"I've been a huge fan of Karen Kingsbury for many years but I had not ever read this book so I was really excited when it arrived in my mailbox. I tore the envelope open and proceeded to ignore my housework, lunch and before I knew what had happened my kids were almost late for dance class because I had gotten so wrapped up in Waiting for Morning. This turned out to be a sad but inspiring book and shows that many times people will question their faith due to horrible circumstances but God prevails and is ALWAYS faithful. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars because even though it was a page turner it was really painful for me to read, I almost set it down a couple of times because the character Jenny but I did finish it up and was pleased that I did."
5,Awesome,"I have read many of Karen Kingsbury books in the past, but it had been awhile. This story touched me on a personal level. I can relate to what it is like to be angry at God for taking away your loved ones, especially your children. Hannah goes through an amazing journey, at times not at all easy. But in the end, she finds the answers she seeks."
2,Needs text-to-speech enabled,I will not buy this book for my Kindle because the publisher decided not to enable the text-to-speech option. I work with low vision and blind people. I recommend the Kindle to them because of the text-to-speech adaptation. When book publishers don't allow this feature it makes the book inaccessible to the low vision and blind population.
5,Powerful and beautifully written,"Like Kingsbury's Where Yesterday Lives, this is a powerful story of family relationships and the tests they face when tragedy strikes. Kingsbury's masterful weaving of scripture texts from Lamentations give the novel a deep poignancy. The details are so rich and real that if I didn't know better, I would think the author wrote the story from personal experience. Karen Kingsbury can't write fast enough to suit me!"
4,PLEASE STOP SPOILING THE PLOT!!!,Okay people - a REVIEW is NOT detailing everything that happens in the story! That just ruins for those who haven't read it yet. A review is what you THOUGHT of the book. STOP giving the whole book away!
5,Waiting for Morning-Great is Your Faithfulness,"This is an awesome modern application of the Book of Lamentations. Unbelievable pain and loss when her husband and daughter are killed instantly by a drunk driver. But God felt her pain and loss, and even understood her anger at what had happened that day. But only forgiveness could free her from her pain, loss and anger."
5,reading,always enjoy reading kk's books. They are non-violent and have a christian aspect to them. They are hard to put down once I start reading
3,Ok story - a little far-fetched.,"This book is packed with emotion right from the beginning. To say it is a tear-jerker is an understatement. It's a story that, as a wife and mother, would truly be my worst nightmare. Kingsbury does a great job of putting the reader in the story, making you feel what the characters feel.However, I didn't like this book as much as previous Kingsbury novels. The main reason was that I found myself really disliking Hannah Ryan. Her selfishness and anger were very irritating to me.The other problem I had with the book was that it felt the charges against the drunk driver were a bit far-fetched and unlikely to ever really happen.Overall, it is a decent book and most Kingsbury fans will probably enjoy it.*I must mention that I received a complimentary review copy of this book from Waterbrook Multnomah."
5,Very Insightful,"Very insightful into a person filled with bitterness and hatred, who was a loving, born again Christian. It really shows that no matter how long you walk with the Lord, you are still a human being, subject to all the frailties that comes from being human. Also that we can never stray so far away that God can not find us and bring us back to Him."
3,Not a miracle product but acceptable,"From the rave reviews I read, I expected more. It does a good job of cleaning, but oily skin is still an issue. It tends to burn when you use it, and my first thoughts were, aah great! No pain, no gain?? Well, I see only a slight improvement in pore visibility. Been using it about a month, so maybe it's too soon to tell. I'm inclined to say ""save your money,"" but everyone's skin is different."
1,Don't waste your money,"The Italians have an expression in relation to translated works: ""Tradurre e tradire"", meaning ""to translate is to betray"". Indeed, this book by the renown French writer Boris Vian fits the description. After reading the oeuvre in it's original French, I found this English translation to be completely flat and, dare i say it, unpoetic. And what a shame, since Vian's original work was anything BUT unpoetic. Having thought this reaction was limited to those who read the original work, I was surprised and even a little relieved to discover that my fellow classmates who did not read the original French version found the English translation just as monotonous. For those without the aptitude of reading the original French edition, I strongly recommend buying a different translation of the Boris Vian's ""Foam of the Daze""."
4,Great Read,"Very interesting description of reptiles from the earliest times into the dinosaurs. Colbert writes very well so he keeps your attention as he describes long ago vanished ecosystems. One nice thing is he pays alot of attention to all reptiles, not just dinosaurs that are basically the media favorite. The book is a relatively easy read good for the lay person interested in paleontology."
5,A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this record after I read the review in The New York Times and I strongly recommend it. Whether or not you like Latin Jazz you will be amazed by the music of this record. It's a wonderful showcase of Latin American music where the melancholy vibe of Buenos Aires is ever present.
2,something of a revisionist history,"This is certainly a famous and long standing presentation of Buddhism, it is about Buddhism and not a guide to doing Buddhism. Perhaps it has inspired some who read it to follow a course of practice, but this does not seem to be its intention. In that respect it wastes its position of leadership. If the reader wishesBuddhist Sutras: Lesson Book: Introduction to Rational Buddhismto learn how to DO Buddhism, consider Buddhist Sutras: Lesson Book."
2,"Poor Quality, Weird Feeling...","The overall quality of this case is pretty pathetic. It probably wont last very long. Also, it has this really strange feeling material that almost sticks to you hand (almost like rubber). I only paid $8 which was fine for its rare use to transport DVDs on vacations."
1,Question your purchase.,"Bought a Samsung 50 inch DLP about six months ago. When we got it home we couldn't get it to stay on, so the store sent over someone to replace the bulb. Unfortunately the store support ended after 90 days. Then...Samsung was supposed to take over. Fast forward five months ""today."" The TV started shutting off after five mins of playing. Called Samsung, unfortunately we moved and didn't have the receipt. A call from the store didn't help Samsung understand that the TV is still covered. Our six month old $1699 TV, is now going to cost us $717 to fix. Thanks Samsung...from a guy who bought two laptops and two TVs and a microwave from you...never again."
1,defective,"Excited to wait for ship't arrival today. VERY disappointed this thing is not working at all. Only has audio, video is none, only black screen. Call Samsung support and response is SLOW!! Now hope Amazon will response better for return/exchange."
1,Unreliable tv - ours broke twice in 7 months - horrid customer service,"We bought this tv (Samsung LNS3251) in August 2006; less than 2 days after we bought it, the sound broke. It was repaired within a week fortunately. Five and a half weeks ago it broke again - the picture is gone. After about 3-4 weeks of battling with repairmen and customer service, they determined the tv was a lemon and have finally offered to replace it. But with a much lesser model and not a full warranty - just the remaining time on our original warranty. This is outrageous and such a poor example of customer service. Samsung should be ashamed of themselves for such flagrant poor service - not to mention the poor performance of the tv. Good luck with this if you don't mind risking a so-called lemon."
2,Died after a week,"Nice looking TV, The picture was great. Even SD channels looked very good. One problem-it just died after a week. I took it back to Best Buy without a problem and got the 40"" Samsung (LNS4041D). So far that's very nice. I'm glad I got the bigger TV."
5,"Samsung LNS3251D 32""","Excellent picture and sound. I compared Sony, Sharp and Samsung 32"" LCD HDTV's and found that this model has the highest contrast ratio and the best overall picture quality. I have it only for few weeks and so far I like it very much."
3,Dead Pixels and Amazon/Samsung Won't Rectify,"I knew that once I opened the box and signed off on delivery the Samsung LNS3251D would be mine and I wouldn't be able to return it, but I didn't expect that Samsung would not assist in having my set's dead pixel issue resolved. Although there are only a few dead pixels in a cluster, they are in the viewing area of the screen. What is strange to me is that I viewed at least 10 display models and none had any dead pixels. (Are the problem screens being ""reserved"" for Amazon purchasers?) So you need to keep this in mind when purchasing TV's from Amazon.UPDATE:Could not get either Amazon or Samsung to rectify problem."
5,Love it!,"I spent probably two weeks researching different HDTVs on the web, then about an hour and a half at an electronics store watching different TVs to see which has the best picture quality.This Samsung 32"" Wide LCD HDTV beat them all by far. All the different functions and connectivity features make it easy to utilize with other equipment.One thing that makes a huge difference in picture quality is the contrast ratio, which on this TV is 4000:1. When watching my first HD programming, it seemed like the people on TV were sharper than reality. It is absolutely amazing.The only draw-back of this TV is that it has one tuner, which means the PIP function is available only when used between certain connections. I couldn't, for example watch one cable program and have another channel on in the PIP. But I can use it as a PC screen and watch cable in the PIP, which I find very cool.This was definitely a great choice for me, especially with Amazon's amazing price - about $400 cheaper than anywhere else."
2,32 inch samsung LNS3251D,"I received this item on Jan. 18, 2007. The t.v. was defective and only worked for a couple of hours. It took a couple of weeks to receive this item. I should say that amazon was real prompt in returning this item to them for a refund. To say the least, I was very disappointed with the operation of the t.v. because I couldn't watch the NFL playoffs, the main reason why I bought it. I have since returned the item to Amazon, and went to Circuit City to buy a t.v. I would really hesitate to make another purchase on amazon again."
1,DONT BUY SAMSUNG TV,"WE BOUGHT A FLAT SCREEN LCD 1.5 YEARS AGO AND THE PIXELS HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO DIE. EVEN THOUGH IT IS A MANUFACTURE'S FLAW, SAMSUNG WILL NOT REPAIR THE DEFECT. A ONE YEAR WARRANTY IS NOT ENOUGH. WE DID NOT MISUSE OR DAMAGE THE SET BUT IT STILL STARTED TO DIE."
4,Samsung,"Good TV, I use this as a PC moniter as well. The TV does not accept a PC signal via HDMI for some reason, so I use the VGA. I Dont have a HD cable box yet, so I have not used the HDMI. The TV has 2 HDMI, but only one reguler Hi Def input. My dvd player and X box have reguler Hi def cable outs, so this causes a problem. The connection issues are the only problems I have with this purchase."
5,Sweet,I love this TV. Also works great as a PC monitor. The kicker is hooking it up for video conferencing via Instant Messenger. Wow my freinds are Life Size now!
5,Awesome Television,"What more can I say? This TV is an excellent performer for the price. I switched from Dish Network (Don't ask - all I can say is they are horrible) to Comcast for the HDTV support and the results have been excellent. Bought a $30 HDMI cable and sat back in amazement - Cinemax is showing the Star Wars movies in HDTV and Revenge of the Sith even had my girlfriend in a trance. (She absolutely hates Star Wars!) Also use it for gaming w/XBOX 360. Provides a great gaming experience, the picture is excellent.Pros --Many different connections supported so toggling between sources is a breeze.-Price-Good Picture Quality-Appearance - Black FinishCons --Scenes that are low lighted are sometime hard to see.-Amount of time it takes the set to ""power on"" is annoying.Great TV- I highly recommend it!"
5,Excellent Excellent image,"I spent a lot of time at various stores looking at 32"" LCD sets since that's the largest size I could fit. The only set that had a comparably rich image was a slightly cheaper Philips model that was 3 inches too wide for my cabinet. I spent the extra money and got the Samsung and haven't regretted it. Beautiful image.The only drawbacks are the downward facing speakers and the complicated menu system. The sound is uneven at times with some frequencies coming thru much louder. The menu hides some functions that you might want quicker accesss to.I have discovered one quirk. If you use it as a computer monitor (which it does really well), leave a DVI to VGA adapter attached to the VGA port and turn the monitor off something strange happens. When you turn it back on the set will immediately go into energy saving mode and prevents you from accessing the menu. Removing the DVI adapter fixes the problem."
3,Great TV but not great sound,We purchased this T.V. and placed it in our media armoire. The picture is great but we find it is very hard to hear. I don't know if this has to do with the tv being in a cabinet and the placement of the speakers on the TV or if it is just the TV. Even with the volume high we often miss words or sentences if there is any other ambient noise in the room. It also seems to lag when the power button is pushed to turn it on. Sometimes the lag is so long you push the power button again and end up in a cycle of turning it off/on.
1,SAMSUNG NEW TV ARRIVED COMPLETELY DEFECTIVE,"I ordered a Samsung TV through amazon to be sent to my daughter residing in washington d.c. After several weeks, the TV arrived and she left it in the package until the cable tv man could come make the connection and help set it up. He was present with unpacking and told her the TV was completely defective; no images could be viewed, only multiple colors appeared on screen. I live outside the U.S. and told her to call Samsung and they told her they could only 'repair' it, not exchange for a new one. I was indignant that I had to pay for a new (not used)TV that was defective and had to be repaired prior to even turning it on. I tried amazon returns but the site is down. I hope for a resolution because I am really upset that a new tv can be delivered completely defective, and i no longer want a samsung and expect a full refund and hope i don't have problems with amazon with this. I will have to search for another manufacturer now."
4,Great Product at a Great Price,"Picture, sound, and look are fantastic. Works great with the home theater system.The only reason for giving it 4 is the shipping took too long. It was shipped 6 days after the order was placed and another 7 days to arrive."
2,shipping sucks,DOn't buy this tv from amazon if you want to actually receive it. The shipping is awful - just go buy it locally or from a reliable online source.
1,Samsung HDTV Beware - EXTREMELY slow shipping,The picture and sound are AWESOME! Highly recommend this Samsung TV to anyone in the market for a QUALITY HDTV.
5,I love it!!,By far one of the best LCDs in it's class and a GREAT deal here on amazon. Set up is a cinch. Picture and aound are fantastic. And it just plain looks good.
3,Good quality,"I had it for about four years. Worked very well, never had any issues with it. Sold it after getting a newer Samsung tv. Note that this only has 720p so not ideal if you want to connect a computer to it."
5,An excellent Super Bowl purchase 2+ yrs. ago!,"I needed a new television since my 15"" set wasn't ""doing it"" for my grandsons and visitors, so after much research I decided upon the Samsung LNS3251D 32"" LCD HDTV. Of course I priced them everywhere and Amazon had the best price until----SUPER BOWL TIME---big TV sales everywhere.The weight was of the TV was easy for me to bring home, and the set-up was so simple even with a separate cable system box and DVD player. I still needed to call my cable provider for the HD, but I could still watch it without it. The TV is set-up user friendly as you may notice if you look at the backside. I've had no problems and the picture is unbelievably clear with perfect color. I'd recommend it to anyone thinking of upgrading to a larger, or an HD TV.Samsung LNS3251D 32-Inch LCD HDTV"
4,Samsung LNS3251D 32,"The HD picture is very good. The analog picture is not as good as a standard tv. Overall, I am very satisfied and will be more so when HD broadcasting becomes more common."
5,"Purchase of 32"" Samsung LCD TV","This was an effecient and simple way to buy a television. I knew what I wanted, so it was only a matter of minutes on-line making the purchase. The set arrived in Orlando at the earlier part of the promised delivery window, and the actual physical delivery to my home was on time.Less than a month after my purchase I repeated the process for a 40"" model of the same set. There is nothing like repeat business to tell a service business that they are on track."
1,"If it doesn't ship UPS, buy elsewhere","Picture is very similar to my old Sony. So is sound. Wait a minute, it is my old Sony. I ordered this set over two weeks ago and haven't heard another thing about it. Worst experience with retailer/shipper to date. I understand it's a fantastic set. Do yourself a favor. Hop in the car and go to Circuit City."
3,use with caution,"This is great for removing ball joints that are bad, but if you just need to remove the steering knuckle or other parts and need reuse the old ball joints use a different tool. This tool will destroy the rubber dust boots on the ball joint, and for most vehicles you have to purchase the whole ball joint because the rubber dust boots are not sold individually."
1,glare filter,"This item was too small. I can't use it and did not use, but I kept it. I can't describe an experience because I have not had an experience."
4,Turning Human voices into horn instruments,"I first heard this several years ago on a local classical station, and what stuck with me was the impression of exactly what my title says: human trumpets. A very bold, invigorating yet spiritually smooth sound.Finally I looked up Corsican chant here and ended up with ... well, not exactly what I remembered, but a nonetheless enjoyable unique sound that has elements of Gregorian chant, middle-eastern vocal techniques and rare parallel fifths (mostly on the first and last tracks).For anyone who is a fan of even one of those, this is most definitely worth giving a try."
4,Good album.,"While I think this album pales in comparison to their debut album Transmissions From Eville, I don't really know how well it compares to their second album though. It's still a worthy buy and a good place to start."
3,Decent product,"The pulley is made from pot metal, so it wouldn't be suitable for a high stress application. Considering it's price it is a fair deal for what it is, and it's worked well for me so far."
5,Good holster,This is a decent holster for the Bear Spray product. It's got a good military style clip for hooking on to the belt.
5,Best OO book on the market.,This explains every facet of OO design and analysis. I bought this book years ago and have used it to reinforce many conversations about OO design. What I have found is that the old timer C and COBOL programmers have a very difficult time even thinking like this. This book should be on every developers book shelf. Many of the topics are so common in todays programming disciplines that many students do not even realize they are following it. Many of the patterns and concepts are now so common place in languages like Java and C# that the new developer just thinks this way.
3,VERY DENSE,"Hi, I'm going to storyboard the use case scenarios of my abstraction, and such stuff. If you don't understand what I just said, you won't understand this book."
2,Nice Try.,"Nice try Booch. I love programming, but I absolutely hated this book. In fact my whole class hated it and we did not keep our feelings in. This is not a book for beginning programmers. Booch tries to gorge you with too much information. He does have some cute little pictures though."
3,Any real point to this book?,"This is not really a book for hobbyists but if you're in a professional environment where you have to meet deadlines and etc, then this is a good book. It's good to plan as much as you can when you're working for a paycheck and can't afford to mess up.But I can't see anyone doing this much planning if you do freelance work or are a hobbyist or something.The book just goes wayy too deep into analyzing your designs and stuff. :p"
2,Definately one of the most over-rated OO books around,"There are a lot of real stinkers around in the world of OO books, and, whilst this one is certainly not the worst of them, it is indeed basically void of the kind of conciseness, content and wisdom that one finds in, say, Object-Oriented Software Construction 2ed (Meyer).Mr Booch's work - be it this book or UML - clearly has a stong biased towards C++ and greenhouse-sensory-devices. This is not a problem in itself, but it will prove to be of little benefit to anyone who needs to construct a banking application using a real object-oriented language such as Eiffel or Smalltalk."
4,"A classic, but a little difficult to read","The author has what I would call an ""academic"" writing style which makes the book a bit more difficult to read than it needs to be. It is full of great information, but sometimes you will have to read a paragraph several times to fully understand it. This is not necessarily bad, but if you prefer a more practical or conversational style you should probably find another book.The book thoroughly covers all of the fundamental concepts of object oriented design in a language-independent way. Although there are some C++ code samples they are brief and it is not necessary for the reader to have a C++ background to learn the OO concepts presented in the book.Even though there are newer books out there you still should consider this one because the concepts presented such as encapsulation and polymorphism have not changed and are well covered in this classic work."
3,Over rated,"I read this book about five years ago from cover to cover, omitting a couple of the extended examples. Honestly, it did not make me significantly better at designing programs or analyzing requirements. It's been said there's no silver bullet for designing programs, but considering this book's wide reputation it ought to be helpful. And I don't think it helped me except I guess in a subtle slight deepbackground way. Certainly there are things in the book that are worth knowing but this is not the best place to get them from, imho."
4,A useful text.,"Booch is one of OOA/OOD's gurus and anyone interested in these subjects should give this book a try. The book provides a useful insight to OOA/OOD methodologies. Although the text is somewhat prolix in places, when Booch decides to get into detail he does so with clarity and coherency. The section on applications is invaluable with a wide range of subjects discussed in detail."
4,Good book but not a great book..,"Have had this book on my bookshelf since 1995. Won several notable jolt awards which says it deserved a look..First of all, this books is kind of old(1994) and still illustrates using OO diagramming techniques before UML unified the major offerings. The C++ used in the book is not a problem.. its the concepts that are important and are generally well explained.Second of all, OO methodologies IMO are immature (especially back then) compared to more mature functional analysis and design methodologies(like IE) and this book shows it. Nonetheless, it is a good book to get you up the initial learning curve of OO.It may not be a dummies book(as some reviewers previously lament) so if your looking for a dummies book look elsewhere. In my opinion it is sparsely full of good OO information."
4,great book but amazon sells just the book no magnet with it,Great book a lot of good experiments I was under the impression it came with a magnet as teh book claimes but amazon only was selling the book.
4,Excited for future releases,"I heard about this band at SXSW 2000. I didn't know what to expect, but I listened to the first three songs with delight. This band is a band, so if you're expecting lyrics like Eliot (T.S. not Smith), stay away. These songs are sexual and violent energy, like a young Iggy Pop whose found a cache of synthesizers. Parts of the album are a little more expiremental than listenable. However, the bulk of this album is first rate work, and has me wondering when the next album will come out."
3,Novelty music,"As a retro 80's new-wave style band, these guys are top-notch musicians. I was a little bitter about hearing this album after their mind-blowing debut, Media, and have yet to forgive them for abandoning their previous style in favor of the new-wave stuff. Like I said, this might be a near-perfect retro album but it lacks much of the lyrical genius, pure creativity, and emotional power that first made them great."
5,Billy Hart...just makes me melt !,"I stumbled across this song accidently. OMG! I can't believe I have not heard this on the radio...maybe I am just not catching it. Any-who! I just love this song, Billy's voice is so soothing & sexy, it is the kind of song that is perfect for listening to at night. I highly recommend this single if you are a romantic."
2,Cute BUT Fragile,"I got a set of these at Ross for $3. My sons loved them, but if a child accidentally dropped one the spoon would break from the animal. The last one was the penguin, my 5YO's favorite. I had it on the counter top and hit it with my elbow, sending it sailing towards the floor ... CRASH ... two pieces yet again. So I bought this expensive set because I felt bad. Cute, yes! Fragile, yes! Great for kids, no! Worth the money, no!"
5,Improve feed himself interested,"The packaging looks good, playground-like electric horse swivel. Bought to eat ice cream to his son, but he used to eat is also very good, handles great, 2-year-old boy just hold. Four animals in turn change the high-interest than an ordinary spoon."
4,About those boom mikes...,"I suspect that the film may have been intended to be originally shown in a theatrical aspect ratio of 1.66:1 or 1.85:1, but was shot in 4/3 (1.33:1) and matted to the theatrical aspect ratio. When matted, the boom mikes would not be visible, but for the video release, instead of blowing up the widescreen picture to full screen, they may have just removed the mattes at the top and bottom, which would reveal the previously concealed boom mikes."
5,A Hollywood version of the book;however the characters match,"The book was part of the library in the Hypnosis Institute of Ft. Worth. In the book he is a master of judo and hypnosis. If you notice in the movie he carries keys. The movie just implies that he uses keys for hypnosis.Mollymauk has the ability to get whatever he wants; that is until he meets Barbara Ann Greene and nothing-quite goes as planned. Who would ever suspect that something that was called deadly nightshade would only make you sick?They picked just the right characters for the part and no matter what movies Roddy McDowall is in I will always think of him as Mollymauk.The film also has a catchy tune that is played throughout the story.See Lola Albright again as a mother in ""The Impossible Years"" (1968)See Roddy McDowall again in Agatha Christie's ""Evil Under the Sun"" (1982)."
3,"McDowall, Weld and Gordon salvage this disjointed mess","This movie tries to be a brilliant satirical comedy, but it fails almost as often as it succeeds -- and a few of the failures are downright painful to watch. E.g. the scene of a father lusting after his daughter, to the point of moaning and drooling, tries to be funny, or bizarre, or something, but comes off simply as what it is: horribly creepy and perverted.Also, the direction in this film isn't just bad, for the most part it's non-existent. Fortunately with Weld, McDowall and Gordon at the acting helm, the lack of direction isn't fatal."
2,John Waters without the oomph,"Granted, it WAS the '60s, but that's no excuse for this heavy-handed satire. You'll want to soundly slap just about everyone involved in it (well, except for the wondrous Ruth Gordon).I figured this to be a last-ditch attempt to make a teen idol of sad old queen Roddy McDowell.Many of the scenes, especially those involving Tuesday Weld and her ""father,"" have a real John Waters feel -- I found myself wondering if the Master of Sleaze had seen this abortion of a movie.Make like it's the '60s again and watch it high -- otherwise, you won't be able to stomach it."
1,Tape was of poor quality,"Like the title states, the tape was of poor quality and skipped alot, making viewing difficult, and it is to much of a pain and just as costly to ship back.I do not recommend buying from this media distributer."
2,Blah blah blah.,This book could be reduced by half & still tell the story decently. At one point there are 60+pages of preaching and retelling the anthems from the series. Felt like a bored grade-schooler waiting for the end of the school year to finally #@!!# learn something new. Not sure if it's worth the wait anymore.
5,Kept me on my toes,"This was a very interesting book, I've read all of them and this one kept me in suspense until the end. Some of the speeches are a bit redundant, but I guess they are needed to keep the book long lol. I'm excited to get to the next and final book in this series."
3,Spoiler!,"If you haven't read this, don't read any more of this review. If you have... am I the only one that is disapointed in every book having a happy ending? Richard could be beheaded and still end up living happily ever after until the next volume. This was a good read, they all are, but the early books parallel Jordan and the later ones become increasingly predictable."
3,Goodkind slacking a little....,"This book hasn't been nearly as good as the rest of his work on this series so far. I haven't read all of it, but truly hope it gets better towards the end."
4,An Unexpected Surprise,"Goodkind seems to be rehashing alot of the key elements within his first book, Wizards First Rule. Its as if he went back and reread that book and realized he had just dropped alot of topics. So instead of just leaving them a bunch get thrown into this novel.That being said the book wasnt overly bad. It was a little hard to push through, but nearing the end it suddenly took alot of unsuspected turns which really made it worth my time. It set the concluding book up quite well. For the first time in a long time I'm actually excited for the next book."
1,absolutly... disapointing,"Well, to make it short I've been waiting for this book for a long while. After less than 50 pages I had already some doubt about the quality of this book.Goodkind keeps watering the story by paraphrasing Faith of the Fallen and other books of the serie. To sum it up, nothing or near to nothing happens in the 576 pages (especially if you compare it to wizard first rule)So Mr. Goodkind, it's time now to finish the serie, I hope that you'll manage to at least end it well (but I doubt it, since the last 4 books weren't good at all)"
4,Finally Moving Onward,"I really enjoyed the book, but the best part is the note at the end, ""Be sure to look for the next and concluding book in the Sword of Truth Series."" I feel that the earlier books were dragged out too long, and that the series would never end. I kept reading eagerly, because I wanted to see how things turned out, but a couple of the books could have been condensed considerably. It looks like TG is starting to wrap things up for the grand finale and I look forward to it's publication."
2,"blah, blah...blah","Ok, I get it. The imperial order is the enemy...they're bad..they do bad things. Do I really need 50 pages of a woman's dialogue telling me how bad and brutal they are. I think I'm only reading this at this point because it's the second to last book. I've invested too much time to not find out what's going on. If you haven't bought this book yet, or don't have the patience for 50 pages of dialogue, I suggest that you walk away."
2,"Rape, Rape, and more Rape...","In the first 200 pages there is nothing but the same thing we have heard from in the other books about what the order does to women. They rape them, they also torture people and kill babies. Thanks for the first 1/3 of the book being about rape. Also the same crappy intellucutally ideas Terry Goodkind keeps rehasing out of the characters to make him self look smart. I enjoyed all the books up to this one."
5,Awesome!,"Wow. So much happened in this book, especially the end. Fantastic read, as Richard and his party start to progress in the chainfire struggle...new obstacles show up at the most inconvenient times, as usual. I read it in about a day and a half...I couldn't put it down!"
3,Better than the last,"For those of you that have listened to the previous books, throw out the first 7cds of this one and the rest is a great listen. The first seven cds were worthless info that did not add to the story.imho"
2,Disappointing ovreall with sparks of quality here and there,"I am about ready to give up on this series, but I think I can make it one more book. This one was again disappointing. It rambled on and on over the exact same tired ground covered in other books. Then there would be a bit of action that was interesting and might have a good twist. Then it would ramble some more. I skipped whole paragraphs and pages and missed none of the plot. If you have stuck it out this long with the series, sure, so ahead. Otherwise don't bother."
2,It's almost over,"As it turns out, Goodkind actuall wrote a review of Phantom himself--here it is, on page 147:""...went on in endless detail...the senselessness of it was almost too monumental to comprehend, much less endure.""Enough said. . .oh, wait-here's some more. If your plot bogs down, and as an author you've written yourself into a corner, then here's a couple of tips:1. Bring back several characters you haven't heard from in several years - they'll be glad to help the plot along.2. Discover that there is a previously unknown book called, ""Everything you need to know to defeat the enemy, but were afraid to ask."""
1,I just want to tell the characters to shut up already!,"Ok, so my first problem is probably the fact that I bought the book on a cd to listen to as I drive to work. I did this with Chainfire and I loved it. But in Phantom, the characters just go on and on with their preaching. With a book I would just skim over the paragraphs (pages... chapters...) that incessently drone one, but that doesn't work with a cd.I'm currently about half way through the novel. I know I will finish it and I will probably buy the next book just to get closure. But boy am I dissapointed!"
2,PHANTOM is a ghost of a good Goodkind novel...,"Like so many others, I have loved this series from the get-go. Wizards First Rule, followed by my favorite of the 10 books, Stone of Tears, set solid precedents in the very fabric of the fantasy genre.Then the slow decline ensued. Some books were better than others. Richard started yammering about his belief systems in large sums of paragraphs, making most of us yawn. But still, the overall core of the story and its characters were good.PHANTOMS is without a doubt, the weakest of them all. I prectically skimmed the entire 587-pages of this vast volume of which about only 10% of it was interesting. What a shame.Just when the series has 1 book left in it, one would think that Terry Goodkind would put his very best into it. And perhaps, according to him, this is! (Lord, I hope not.)There are some good scenes in the book. But they are unfortunately few. I hope the very last book in this once great series ends with a bang. It truly needs it."
5,Sword of Truth,This couple can never get a break or all they get are breaks. Another great book in a wonderful series.
1,Real slow read,"The only thing that kept me from throwing ""Phantom"" in the trash,is that I paid $9.00 for it."
4,Necessary Read but Lackluster,"original review 2007While I have to admit that I read this book in just three days, it was only because I was dying for Richard and Kahlan to get back together. Yet, I was destined to be disappointed because nothing happens in this book! This book spent 600+ pages describing the thought process of EVERY SINGLE character thought by agonizing thought on their road to the 'Final Deciding Battle'. It isn't that I didn't like the book; I just wish that there would have been some sort of development in the story other than the brief thing with Richard and Six. I waited two years for this book to come out on paperback only to be frustrated by the thought of waiting another year for the paperback version of book 11.+++++ Follow up in 2012I never finished the book series. I got fed up with too much talk and not enough action."
2,Not as good as the previous books,"Well, this one is giving me a hard time.I enjoyed all the other Sword of Truth books, but Phantom leaves a bitter taste.I am tired to read again and again about the religious ideology of the order and how bad and cruel Jagangs army is.Come on, this is interesting the first time, it is also ok to mention it again briefly in another book, but if I have to read it a third or even a fourth time in great detail it gets boring and annoying.You could easily cut out 200 pages from this book without loosing any new information.Don't get me wrong - I think Terry Goodking is a great author, but I think Phantom does not meet the high standards of his other books. He just did not focus enough on the story. There were too many detailed descriptions of unimportant things and too many repetitions.Well, I think fans should (and probably will) read it anyways. It is ok, but I hope that the following books will be better..."
4,A very good read - the series continues,"If you are a Terry Goodkind fan, you will have little trouble liking this book. Sure, the story line is somewhat played out, and many fans just want the final confrontation to resolve itself. But Goodkind has committed to taking us on a trilogy ride in the battle between the Richard Rahl side vs. the Jagang side. And guess what? Kahlen is in the middle of it. Again.I think Goodkind got back on track since his last couple books, which were a bit of a side trip in the conflict, although Richard's time in the Old World (Altur Rang specifically) fits into the continuing story. Stand up for yourself and be free. Make your own decisions and own them, etc. It all plays into the climactic conflict, which will take about 2,000 pages to tell.So if you have read all the previous books in this series, this is a must-read. If you are just tuning in to Goodkind, start with Wizard's First Rule and enjoy the ride."
1,Phantom,"What a looser,and a thief.Still couldn't come up with but one chapter of new material for the whole book.After all these books in the series came out the publisher should have trimed it all down to five(5)books as of book four(4) there is but one new chapter in each book.Who wants to read the last book?I don't,and I have them all except the last.It's boring Goodkind."
3,1 Great novel + LOTS of filler = 2 Mediocre books to sell,"I've read the entire series up to and including Phantom at this point, and I've got to say that Chainfire and Phantom were the two books I was least impressed with. My big complaint about these two books is that it seems like they should be (and maybe once were) one book. I get the distinct feeling that there is enough plot here to make one really good novel, but to make a few extra bucks they added a lot of useless filler. To make matters worse, the useless filler is the same in both books. If you cut out the parts of these two books that are essentially the same, you'd end up with a great novel."
2,Plod development...err Plot,"To preface -- Wizard's first rule remains one of my favorite (of hundreds) that I've read in this genre. Sadly, the magic is long gone.Book 10 seems to be the culmination of a series of books dedicated to an ever-increasing number of pages of characters hanging around and pondering things. Unfortunately, nothing else is happening. Though the not-so-subtle metaphors to the human struggle for liberty and freedom from oppression did get me thinking, I still ended up rather bored. Philosophical debate between characters (and little else) doesn't make for a particularly interesting story nor does it leave much room for interpretation.Most interestingly was the jacket-liner note which indicated that the next book would be the last."
2,A good writer who doesn't know how to end his work,"Wizard's First Rule was excellent; Phantom (aka Wizard's Tenth Rule)is fair-decent character development, good texture of description. But, as is the case for many modern, popular authors, Mr. Goodkind doesnt know how to wrap up his story. Maybe we should blame L. Ron Hubbard with hs Decology written 20 years ago (although, admittedly, Goodkind is a much better author)."
5,You get what you pay for,"This being a series, I will assume that we all like the colorful and edgy writing of Mr. Goodkind - and he does deliver plenty of this unique style in Phantom. What set this one apart, for me, was the intricate threading of plot points from previous novels. It is art the way Goodkind is bringing the series full circle with this final trilogy. I felt that I was not only reading a blistering new addition to the series but also gleaning things from the previous novels that had begun to fade with time. Phantom is very rewarding read for fans of the stoic 'Sword of Truth' series.Oh yeah, does anyone's novel say 'Phantoms' instead of 'Phantom' on the binding? I think that my copy is a false key. There were so many editing errors that it had to be deliberate. Somebody at Tor needs to check grammer instead of just running a spell check program."
3,Terry Goodkind Series,"I ordered Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth Series in the Kindle version; I like the story, though it is way too similar to the Robert Jordan ""Wheel of Time"" series, even using some of the same names for main characters; but my main issue is with the editing: there are many errors in spelling, missing words, double words and other editorial issues; I'm hoping this is not true for other Kindle products I have yet to finish reading, but it's been true in the books of this series I've read thus far; I do love how they appear on my Kindle through the ""ethers,"" and, in general, like the story, but not the repetition (which feels like a means of bringing the reader up to date if they missed the earlier books, but is tedious to wade through if you have read the all)"
2,"Too much dialogue, too little action","I've read some of Goodkind's work before. I know he can write better than this. The story of this book was so short but taken up by a lot of dialogue filler, it's as if he wanted to make a trilogy so bad he put in a bunch of nonsense.673 pages for no movement in the story line. I'll not be reading the sequel as I barely finished this one.What happened in this story?The queen was a slave to evil Sister and didn't know who she was at the beginning. At the end she was a slave to the evil king and didn't know who she was.The king, her husband, was searching for her, discussed a LOT of things about magic (Boring), decided there would be no final battle, lost his magic and got captured by who? the evil king. 673 pages."
3,Phantom,"Most of Goodkind's books I read in very few days. However, this one took me several days just to get into the middle, where Goodkind's usual gripping writing took over.There is quite a bit of repetition, sadly, in the story about Richard's love, as well as Nicci's longing. I am so glad that people have found a reason to continue to fight on, but I didn't need to be reminded every time the character was brought back into the story. I found myself sometimes skimming an entire page. It almost seemed that the editor copied and pasted to fill the pages of the book, something not needed.More time was spent in Jagang's camp and a better feel for this nasty enemy was provided in this story. This bit livened the story up and increased the intensity of the plot nicely, making me look forward to Goodkind's next book."
2,Not Up To Terry's Usual Standards,"My first gripe might be seen as trivial... though not to me. There is no place on the book's cover (paperback) where I was warned that this book was the 2nd in a trilogy (I haven't read the first). Terry has written some decent fantasy so I grabbed it. Imagine how annoyed I was upon realizing that much of the story was referring to things and issues about which I had no idea and then, to get to the end without any closure at all. For the price of this book, I had to weed through some of the most pedantic, bombastic and verbose nonsense I've ever read since reading Stephan King. Since finding out that this is book 2 of 3... I can't imagine what this one added to the whole story except to sell more books by stretching 2 into 3. I suspect those who read book 1 could skip to book 3 without missing anything important. Definitely not up to Terry Goodkind's usual standards. Ptooey!"
3,"Keeps you interested, but has issues...","well, one big issue for me really. This is book 10 in the series and the main character, Richard, still has no clue how to use his powers. Throughout the series Richard performs monumental feats of magic that no one has been able to do in a thousand years without knowing how, and then the next moment he's totally helpless. Goodkind's excuse is that Richard is a war wizard and that he somehow uses magic by instinct. But this can only work for so long and it begins to get tiring book after book. Maybe in the next and last?? book Richard will learn to use his gift (probably in the last two pages)."
3,"Phantom: Chainfire Trilogy, Part 2 (Sword of Truth, Book 10)",I am an avid Goodkind reader. This book was a little disappointing since I epected more. I am impatient to read the next set of books. The Sword of Truth is my favorite series.
4,Excellent book,This book does a great job of moving the story line forward and introducing new information and bring back old characters. I can't wait to read the concluding book.
2,somewhat disappointing,"All along in this series, I've been troubled by Goodkind's use of violence - both regular violence, sexual violence, and the way he kills horses off. (Apparently, concern for life doesn't extend to animals)But this book is over the top with violence. I'm only about halfway through, but was it really necessary to have Jebra's graphic description of life under the Imperial Order? or to have Richard's vision of being one of the people about to be killed? As Richard thinks at one point ""we know all this"". It does nothing to advance the plot, it's merely page filler.It's possible Goodkind was looking for something to make the book longer. I think Chainfire & Phantom could have been combined into one book if a lot of the redundant ""this is what happened in the first few books"" passages and the graphic violence were removed.Hopefully he eases off on that stuff in the final book."
2,almost over...,"if you're like me, you're reading this book because it's the second to last and you just want to finish the series. because the series started out as amazing books that had non-stop action without all the nonsense and unrealism and lecturing that we get to deal with now... one more to go and then richard and kahlan can live happily ever after. yay!"
