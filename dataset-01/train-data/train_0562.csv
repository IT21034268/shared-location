1,ugh,"k i listened to this cd and the first thing i did when it was done...i threw it in the trash , i can't believe i even bothered to waste my money on it but the salesperson recommended it and said they're extremely popular i should've listened to those warning signs going off in my head but i didn't and i wasted my money ugh k these songs dont even have meaning...in the young and hopeless the lead singer or his brother whatever his name is saying ""these critics and these trust fund kids try to tell me what Punk is"" um i thought the lead singer said they weren't punk so where does that come in huh? but i have to agree with a boy against society, nicely said, same with james cox, nicely said ppl :) i was gonna give this cd a 0 but i guess u can't so i've got to give them a 1"
1,Garbage,"You cannot be serious. My god. If you're going to dress gothic, give it the sound. Do not dress in black, tatoo and pierce yourself, and sing like a girl. The three don't mix. If you think this is punk, you are probably going to get beat up by a real punk fan. If you want punk or rock, pick up The Offspring or Nirvana. Do not buy this crap"
2,Placibo Rock At Its Best,".. thats really all i have to say about this band. i mean come on, ""girls dont like boys, girls like cars and money"" wut the hell kinda lyric is that? this is pop right here and I friggin HAte IT!!i was in BestBuy the other day and their song was playing on a giant TV screen and you know who was listening to it and singing along, a little 5 year old kid? honestly, do u want to be that 17 year old that has something in common with a 5 year old kid? ... and it having to be a likeness in music!!but you like what you like, i cant stop you from singing along with tunes that get stuck in your head, yeah some songs maybe catchy on this cd, but Jingle Bells is a catchy song too.i know you all are about to go out and buy this cd, but have faith in my decision to steer you towards music you wont get sick of like Third Eye Blind, Coheed and Cambria, Alice In Chains, Staind, Mudvayne, or even go out and get a country music cd, anything better than this.."
1,Haha,"OK well almost every review says either 1 star or 5 stars, so people who rated it 5 stars listen closely: it sucks. ""These critics and these trust fund kids, try to tell me what punk is but when I see them on the street they got nothin to say!!"" What the hell? Good Charlotte is a far cry from punk..and anyone who wears that much makeup can never be considered tough. In fact, even calling them pop-punk would probably be going too far. The word ""pop"" would do it. Anyway, these guys are just plain sellouts, who make accessible pop that they market as punk so all the 12 year olds can go out and buy it, wear a wristband and jump up and down like theyre cool."
2,Umm...music...?,"Hello! My name is Cheryl and I like power metal. (...)Now I've heard a lot of their songs (when they aren't burned onto the mix CD's stupid people make for me, they're blaring on the radio constantly) and I do admit that they are really catchy tunes and good melodies, and for that I award them 2 stars. Sparkle, sparkle! ...BUT!! What I do NOT like about them is that they commercialize themselves a horrible lot, very Avril Lavigne-esque only there's like 5 of them!!!! I think that they're trying waaaay too hard to fit into the really heavy punk rock category. Punk isn't something that can be made by today's plastic music industry. Someone needs to tell them that that genre will never be reached, if they're trying to reach it intentionally."
2,Good charlotte vs. the media,"Well I have to say i owned this album, I saw them on warped tour a couple years ago and my sister bought me the 1st cd, It was ok but it wasn't really my style, When they started to get more famous I listened to this cd (Which my sister had and burned for me) for fun and i have to say it annoyed me to no end, Yes it was catchy, but the lyrical content.. It had nothing to it. I don't agree with people when they mindlessly bash this group just because they are popular, If they weren't half as many people wouldn't hate them as they do now. But Good charlotte really exploited what it was to be a ""Punk"" and it seems it's not a rebelious thing anymore it's just a fashion statement. But People really need to stop calling everything 'sellout' and 'Poser' it just shows how ignorant you are."
5,GC rocks !,"Before hearing this albumn, I considered Good Charlotte just another punk band. After hearing all of the songs off THE YOUNG AND THE HOPELESS, I found I was wrong. Don't let their image or rock sound fool you. Once you pay attention to the lyrics you find out that the band members are just normal. From the lyrics to ""MY OLD MAN"" speaking about their father leaving them to the lyrics of ""HOLD ON"" written for the inspiration to keep on trying, the songs are all catchy and in some way you can relate."
1,AHHHHHHHHHH,"Are these the 5 year olds who are giving this album such good reviews. Come on people. This is the new school that will end our world. What happened to Green Day and all of those great origninal punk bands. They are the ones to be repsect, not the immitators like this band is!I hate Good Charlotte with a passion."
5,They've Done It Again!,"Wow. What an AWESOME CD! If you are thinking about buying this CD, i have to things two say to you: Why didn't you have it before, and GET IT GET IT GET IT! I listen to this CD every day. It's punk/ska, perhaps punk-pop, but it is GOOOD! It tasty. I mean, I always knew Joel Madden was dead sexy, but that's NOT the reason why you should buy the CD. You should buy the CD because the music KICKS! The songs are so fun and catchy. Also good to scream at the top of your lungs while running through deserted hallways. This CD has something for everything. I got aired on Fuse TV! I am Lday O, off nerr VA! Whooo! So, buy the CD, and all the people like me will be happy and shut up about it."
1,A Trendy Disease To Rock,"All I can say if your listening to this you ovisouly still havent discovered real rock music yet. Good Charlotte Sucks.If you have bought this cd break it. Listen to a real rock band like pearl jam, Audioslave, ac/dc or staind. That all I can say."
1,Wow!!!,"Oh my like god! Oh like my like god!!! F*** Pink Floyd and like Yes! This like cd is gonna like change the like wurld!!!Hopefully you didn't take that seriously...now go watch more MTV kiddies and the manufactured crap they play, just like these guys. And no, MTV supporter saying this is the greatest cd ever recorded doesn't count. Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon is the greatest cd ever recorded. But wait! I don't see Pink Floyd on MTV! How could they be good???!!!!???!!!???!!!??? You get the picture.out..."
5,GC rocks it out again,"gc does an amazing job with this cd. my favorites include emotionless, lifestyles of the rich and famous, the story of my old man, and girls & boys. the lyrics are heartfelt and the whole cd is just moving. if you liked the first cd you'll love this one!"
5,You Are Stupid...,...if you don't get your hands on this cd! It totally rocks! I love it! Good Charlotte just gets you energized.
1,stripping it down to the bare essentials,"some bad bands:GOOD CHARLOTTESum 41Blink 182Simple PlanAll american RejectsAvril Lavigne (if she can even be called a band)Linkin Park (although they are a lot better than any of these other ""artists"")Some Good Bands:The ShinsModest MouseNeutral Milk HotelBuilt To SpillNirvanaSnow PatrolThe KillersQueenFranz FerdinandCheap TrickThe White StripesThe DarknessThe ClashThe DoorsSee how much good stuff you could be listening to instead of this [junk]?I rest my case"
1,THIS SUCKS,i hate this cd ihate this group i hope they split up or retire because they really really really SUCK
1,THE WORST MUSIC(WAIT THIS ISN'T MUSIC),"I hate good charlotted with everything in me.Whoever signed this band should be hurt very badly.I don't get it all these stupid kids from 10-17 like this crappy band!!!! Fortunaly i am not one of them.I would honestly go to one of their concerts to boo them off the stage anyone else interested? It might be hard to stand the music thouhg , bring earplugs.GOOD CHARLOTTE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,agree with whoever else has a brain,good charlotte sucks so much they give punk a bad name and i dont know how that happened... considering they are not punk
1,I cannot believe people listen to this and like it,"Okay, if you bought this CD, recycle it. Our country has a rich history of awesome pop music streching back 50 years. You don't have to look far to find something better than this. That dude's whining voice and the crappy punk facade makes me want to stab myself in the face, and I'm pretty sure I am now sterile because my oln roomate loved this band and played them all the time. I'm only gonna say this once: The Pixies, the Clash, Sonic Youth, My Bloody Valentine, Guided by Voices, Modest Mouse, the Arcade Fire, Jesus and the Mary Chain. And that's just the beginning!"
5,ROCK ON GC!!!,"this is another awesome good charlotte cd! there first cd was so cool and the music was great, but this one just shows how they have grown. my favorite track on the new cd is ""bloody valentine"" and ""riot girl"" but you should go pick it up and see what are your favorites. its rocks!! and i cant wait to see them live!!!"
1,This band is appalingly horrible....,"Good Charlotte is horrible, and poorly displays punk. If you want some real punk check out the Ramones, or the Clash before they went rock. This stuff is just garbage. Oh and by the way MTV sucks...anyone with a taste for real music can't stand mainstream garbage and wigger crap."
1,these guys suck,"These guys are whiney little posers. They sing about the rich and the famous and they are the rich and famous and every other song is just them whining about something. This crappy band is like simple plan, blink 182, greenday, etc POSERS! Some idiots actually think this band is punk they are just a boy band with guitars. I went to the kids review bcause i didnt want to set up an account or whatever, I'm not a kid, I know real punk and this is not punk.This CD doesnt even deserve one star so If you want to listen to real punk DO NOT BUY THIS (...). If you want to listen to real punk listen to The Virus, The unseen, Subhumans, Black Flag, etc."
1,No worse than anything Green Day has put out...,"TerribleAbsolutely terribleBut if you think Green Day is punk then go get this P.O.S. and enjoy, idiots."
5,best cd ever,omg!its just like the best cd everyone has got to buy it!i bought it abd it was worth it!i listen to it everyday!good charlotte id the best band out there!
4,buy it,"the young and the hopeless is a really good cd and is soo worth the 14 or 15 bucks. its been in my cd player on repeat for weeks. if you like new found glory or saves the day, you'll like this cd. lifestyles, anthem,and the die that i die are some of the best songs on the album, but then again, they're all good, so go buy it!!!!"
1,Just another sad pop group,"This is backstreet boys with guitars, which mind you they can't even play. I hate MTV."
1,"BS,BS,BS,BS,BS","complete crap. TRL ""punks"". I'm not a ""trust fund kid"" and i have a good idea ""what punk is"" and it sure as f**k isn't your poison for the ears. All you are a 100000th rate Blink 182, with the song writing skills of Barbara Streisand and the musical talent of Vanilla Ice who sold out to some big company who promised you the chicks you could never get with your microscopic ding dongs with out keeping a f**king shread of your miniscule dignity. In that video you forgot to include the guy who listened to your trash pile of a cd and comitted suicide. Go back to the garbage heap you came from and stop polluting our brains with your mindless dribble."
1,Didn't they used to be called green day???,Wow another pop/punk band that MTV help to create damn you MTV!!!! Like bands like this beofre like green day eventually they will just fade away but everybody in my town listens to this garbage!!! to many punk posers i guess. They write 50% of there songs and people brag about that! PATHETIC! i call them backstreet boys with guitars cause thats all they are.
1,HAS TO BE THE WORST BLACK METAL ALBUM OF ALL TIME,Ok kids stop telling me this is BLACK METAL this is FREAKIN NOT Black Metal. AC/DC are BLACK METAL. Seriously if the devil heard this he would Torture all you emo kids. Seriously dont tell me this is BLACK METAL.
1,my Synopsis,"In the pop/punk scene originally created by the likes of Blink 182 and Sum 41 emerges a band from Astoria called Good Charlotte. Unlike their pop/puk predecessors like New FOund GLory, and Blink 182, Good Charlotte is nothing original at all. Good Charlotte seems like pop with a little punk in it as apposed to punk with a little pop in it.Although their are some highpoints like ""Wondering"" and ""Emotionless"" most of the songs seem like songs that were written in twelve minutes just to have enough songs for an album.However, the highpoint of the album is the over-exposed ""The Anthem"" because it is truly an anthem. It is an anthem for girls that would have been listening to N'Sync to listen to this. It is an anthem for teenie-boppers to monotonously call themselves ""punk"" and say ""I hate preps"" constantly. Although I find this movement annoying, I must applaud Good Charlotte for creating such a movement."
2,Not so great follow up to their first cd,"Okay, I have to admit this is a pretty good cd. There is a lot of variety between the songs and the lyrics are good too. So, you're probably wondering why I'm giving this cd two stars. With the exception of ""the young and the hopeless"", ""my bloody valentine"", ""hold on"" and ""say anything"", this whole cd should of never been released. Especially ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"". Thanks to that song Good Charlotte joined the list of TRL sell outs. If you're a 13 year old girl and love the sellouts on TRL, get this cd. Everyone else, get their first cd, unless you already have it. This cd is just a waste of your time and money. Maybe I'm just mad cause they sold out. I don't know, the first one is just better."
1,This Band SUX!!,"Good Charlotte arent true punk at all they are just a bunch of poser wanna be's. They delve into rap all the time and even have turntables, all u kids out there that spew all that about this being the *real* stuff, you have no idea. U want some REAL punk rock check out the sex pistols, black flag, the dead kennedys, and social distortion. The only bands working now days that are real punk are Powerman 5000 and the Hives so check yourself b4 u go spewing forth about a band and an album that are posing."
1,No.,"This past school year, I witnessed something miraculous. A large portion of my peers wearing eye makeup, chains, and torn-to-hell green cargo pants. The words Good Charlotte or simply GC written were on their binders, and sometimes their clothes. They say that they are ""rebelling"". Rebelling against what? They called themselves ""punks"". No. They ride home on their mountain bikes to their middle-class four bedroom house and eat cookies and milk. They are not punks or rebels. They are lost children looking for a way to fit in. When Good Charlotte appeared they all decided to jump on the ""pop-punk"" bandwagon. Its desperately sad that they couldn't find anything else. Now they listen to this CD, this hopeless garbage, every day on the bus ride home completely oblivious to the many wonderfully talented musicians that exist in our world."
4,It's allright...,"I thought that the music itself is pretty good. I'm not gona be a hypocrite and say that they are punk or rock. They are just pop. And for that matter neither Blink, or Green Day are punk, ok? They are pop, too. I find it so stupid when people trash bands like Good Chrlotte and say you should listen to a ""hardcore"" punk band like Blink. They are just as pop as Good Charlotte. I admit Good Chrlotte are posers and that their image doesn't represent their sound, but people get a life. Don't even try to tell me I'm a teeny bopper. I think this band has a good sound even. Their songs are pretty good. Thus the 4 stars."
4,Good Charlotte...more like Best Charlotte,"Good Charlotte is the best band since Cryptopsy. If you like Good Charlotte and have never heard of Cryptopsy, I highly recommend you buy at least one of their CDs. You are guaranteed to love it."
1,"Rich, Famous, Young, and Hopeless","This is just too much. And people think Good Charlotte is punk?! No, they are not. They are pop-rock, posers. Wannabe-Punkers, whaddever you want to call them. How can anyone like this? Folks, this is not music. If you want some punk, go somewhere else. This is pop, and this is horrible. If you're looking for some corny, lovesick music, this is for you. I am sorry if I seem rude, but it's the truth."
2,Power pop at its best and least,"Good Charlotte is the 2003 version of REO Speedwagon, Kansas and the other '80s groups that always let a power chord drwon out asny sense of originality. I'm not the mid teens to early 20s age group that this is aimed at but I do listen to Radiohead and others and perhaps that is the problem.Good Charlotte is like a stick of gum with powerful flavor on first bite, but sooner rather than later the flavor is gone. The lyrics vary from teenage rant to misogomy to hold on, we've been there things will get better, to my Dad drinks too much. . . you get the point.What is lacking here is texture, originality, not talent. What they do they do well, it's just what they do looses flavor to quickly for my tastes."
1,this Is PUNK?????,"oh my god . this is what you people call punk? this aint punk. thi is the kind of band that can see all their videos on nickelodeon. this is pop!! if this is called PUNK then the PUNK music that i knew is dead. this $#!t is a disgrace to punk music. these guys arent fast, punk, cool, loud, punk, cuz they are stupid pop dudes. an exect impression of simpole plan. This is serious. if this is today's PUNK what happenened to the real Punk music. You fans of GC make me sick"
4,Kinda fresh...,"I'm tired of whiny critics like the one below. Get over yourself. You're not cool because you're a ""purist,"" it just makes you look uninformed and unintelligent. With that in mind, Good Charlotte takes a stab at people like the negative reviewer below with The Young and the Hopeless.As this isn't my preferred genre of music, forgive me if my review/critique isn't complete. Basically, if you're tired of the typical stereotyping and three-chord crap that's ruling the radios these days, you might find Good Charlotte to your liking.By far, The Anthem and Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous are the best tracks on this album, which doesn't mean that the song wasn't good before the fans made it so, just that the record company knew a good song when they heard one.If you need something fresh and different, grab it!"
4,THEY ARE REALLY GOOD !!!!!!,"For this cd i would have too say its great to listen too when your bored or just dont know what to do.Their music is awsome when it comes to the rythme and beat, the lyrics are meaningful but not to great. As for the people who diss them, come on they are NOT that bad even if there not punk.My favorites on this cd would be wondering and lifestyles of the rich&famous.also movin'on,heck every song on this albem is pretty much good.so if you judge them by not being punk, your missing out!!!!!!!!!"
2,I liked their last CD better..,"I considered myself a Good Charlotte fan when their last CD came out, the songs were pretty good and no one else seemed to really know who they were. All that changed when they hit it big on MTV..now I have nothing against popular bands, but if I hear""lifestyles of the rich and famous"" one more time I'm going to go crazy. A friend bought me this CD, I played it maybe twice the whole way through, why would I want to listen to GC songs when I hear them constantly on the radio and MTV? Maybe it was the fact that GC is being shoved down my throat or perhaps I find the way their attitudes have totally changed in the interviews that they've become these cocky jackasses now..but I no longer consider myself a Good Charlotte fan. As far as this CD goes, save yourself some money and just turn on the radio they're bound to be played in another 5 minutes anyway.."
2,Depends on your interests...I don't like it,"If you like pop punk (read: stuff you find all over MTV), then this is for you. Personally, I don't like that stuff. My interests are more metal/nu-metal, but I do listen to punk, and this is not punk, its pseudo-punk, which does have its place but should not be confused with real punk. Once again, if you haven't listened to it, I recommend you preview 1 song, any one. It doesn't really matter which one...they all sound the same anyway. And to all you guys who DO like that stuff you choose to call by the wrong name, congratulations. You've succeeded in rewarding the bands that put the record label's fat contract before their own creativity (or lack of it). But out of sympathy I'll grant you an extra star.One last thing: These guys cannot play live. They aren't together as a stage act at all. The worst bands at my school are better instrumentalists than Good Charlotte."
5,WICKID,"This is the best album out there right now. Sure enough, they're not hardcore- but who says they're trying to be? At least they're not commercialised like Blink 182, Avril Lavigne, etc etc. Good Charlotte is a band with talent and who aren't afraid to say whatever they want, who don't have to get help with lyrics or get their music written for them. This is the best album(and the best song is The Anthem) that I've seen in a long time so if you're complaining about Good Charlotte not being ""hardcore"" enough for you, try having a look at what they really are and listen to their songs. They don't have to be hardcore to make mad songs and that's the best thing about them... and if you don't like that, don't listen to them. Not too hard to do."
1,oh please!,"With the exception of bands such as Incubus, Dave Matthews Band, Radiohead, and Days of the New, modern music is going down the Chatahoochi River. This is one of the worst efforts by any band I have ever heard. There is nothing special about the content of this album. The songwriting has as much depth as a bathtub. They're just doing something that has already been done before. All these little high school bands are nothing but an ego trip talent show that you can't wait to end. Good Charlotte is probably the second worst popular band when it comes to this. We need more adults like Neil Young out there showing this young'uns how to run things. Albums like these make me happy to know I'm about to graduate to keep from walking the halls with these fools. I know some yuppie girl named Cayla is probably reading this review right now turning red with anger. Oh well!"
2,POSERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Your trying to be rockers, but you're really pansys. Your music reminds me of country. You are just depressed teenagers."
5,good charlotte rocks!!!!,"let me just start off by saying that this cd is one of the best cds i have in my collection!!! people tell me ""good charlotte, yeah, whatever, they're not punk"" but WHO FREAKING CARES???? If the music is good, i'll listen to it, regardless of whether its ""punk"" or not cuz labeling is just stupid. Sure, i listen to what others call ""true punk"" like rancid, but come on, let it go, who says you can't also listen to other music? this cd really rocks, and if you like good rock music, I HIGHLY recommend this cd. I love thier sound and they write great songs, songs i can actually relate to!! good charlotte is my favorite band, and to all those who tell me what ""true punk"" really is, sorry, but its just all b.s. to me. IF ANY MUSIC IS GOOD AND I LIKE IT, I'LL LISTEN TO IT, I DON'T CARE WHAT GENRE IT IS, WHETHER ITS PUNK, OR ROCK, OR POP, I DON'T CARE!!! and i'll leave it at that...oh yeah, did i mention that you really should get this cd because it really rocks???"
5,Its Good Stuff,If you arent into the whole punk rock scene then don't get this cd. Its pure punk the lyrics really dont mean anything but they are catchy. I love GC and it will be like that for a long time. If you people out there dont think they have any talent think again ever try playing a guitar or drums its hard stuff. i give my props to those felas rockin on for their fans. Just think they are more famous than a lot of you people so stay on the down low bout their music they wrote it so just shut up!!
1,I guess this confirms it..,"punk is dead, or close to it. All this mainstream crap is over-shadowing the 'real' music. I dont know how this is called punk.. its pretty sad when the most 'rebelious' song is one about 'putting your hands up'. To all you 10-year olds who like them, try lisening to NOFX, Bad religion, Ramones or Green Day. Leave it to MTV to find a way to sell these kinds of records.."
5,good charlotte rocks!!,"Holla out to all you Good Charlotte Fans!!! Whats up,Okay so anyway I was reading about what you people said about Good Charlotte I find it really mean and not all of the stuff you said about gc was true the songs on gc album are not the same for your information,and all you gc hatas keep your stupid untrue comments to your selfs thank you!gc fans, there is a gc dvd comeing out in nov!!if you don't know gc just open any magizine like j14 etc. to get info about them bye !"
3,Meh nothing special,"When i first listened to this cd i thought it was just ok. Nothing realy caught my interest really. Although I went to a live show of them with a friend when she dragged me to go, and i gotta say THEY DONT SOUND POP-PUNK LIVE. it acutally was a good show. the cd is ok i guess, but they rock in concert (even though i didnt know the words to the songs lol)If you want to hear better music and REAL punk listen to the unseen, anti-flag, propaghdi<sry i spelled it wrong lol, operation ivy, nofx, and pennywise, and of course bad religion. they rock!! best songs : the anthem, say anything, moving on, and umm..boys and girls i guess."
1,This is what started it all.,"Yes it is. This started the Emo/Wannabe punk garbage. This is the CD that has basically created a cult-like following through the music industry today.First off, these guys aren't punk, real punk is The Ramones, The Misfits, and The Sex Pistols.Second, this is garbage. The band has no real talent. Their drummer sounds like he has no idea what he's doing, the guitar is boring simple and uncomplicated. And the singer sounds like he has something wretched up his butt.Don't buy this, but I will counter reccomend these bands and artists:Iron MaidenJudas PriestBlack SabbathOpethRonnie James Dio(Rainbow, Dio, etc.)Led ZeppelinRed Hot Chili PeppersAC/DCJimi HendrixPink FloydNow those are some classic musicians right there."
5,THE BEST CD THIS YEAR BY FAR,"If you like any kind of punk music you will defiently love the young and the hopeless. Good Charlotte have matured no doubt about it. Whether they singing about their singing about their dad or a bloody valentine. The Anthem is an awesome song to lift anybodies spirits up who want to be in ""that"" crowd. !!!!!! GO BUY IT!!!!!! GOOD CHARLOTTE ROCKS"
2,Good Charlotte-,"OK let me make this quite clear to you all. GOOd CHarlotte is not freakin punk!! And one more thing, (the thing that most annoys me) please don't say, ""Yea, I like Good Charlotte even tho they are punk,"" They are deffinatley not. They are like some pop rock..um..thing. But G/c is allright. I like the soung young and the hopeless. But G/C certainlly doesn't compare to Thursay,Story of the Year,Dashboard Confessional,From Autumn to Ashes,or A.F.I"
3,GC's gone downhill ..,"I've been listening to Good Charlotte since I first saw the on HFStival, which was in 1999 or 2000. That's about 4 years. I loved (and still do love) GC for their music, their energy and I love everything about the band. Except this album. I LOVE their first album. It's my 2nd favorite CD(my first would have to be Silverchair's 'Neon Ballroom'), and I knew that had changed since the release of their selftitled album, but I didn't expect them to change to this MTV ..., poppy band. They're on TRL. Thanks to the Avril-wannabe, New Found Glory-blaring poseurs, GC is now being controlled by the mindless workers of MTV/TRL and punk pop. I still love the boys and the first album, how could I not ?, but this album will be sitting on my shelf, gathering dust, until I need a good laugh."
3,"Not Punk, But Fun",I have always hated bands like Blink182... Bands that get credited to being punk bands when there songs are all poppy. That said I was suprised when I got the new Good Charlotte CD from a aunt (who did not know my taste in music) and actually somewhat liked it. The songs are energetic and the band is starting to get some attention which is good for them. I hardly listen to the cd anymore and this kind of music isnt really my cup of tea but I can recognize that they are a solid act.Anthem is definitely the standout song (but I have to admit i'm a little sick of the video).
5,Good Charlotte For Life!,"Good Charlotte is an incredible band, they show that music isn't ALWAYS about how much it hurt when the pittiful relationsip ended after 5 whole months! Joel and Benji write about their father with emotion and I love it.. I love all the songs on the CD..I own it.. and I love the old songs to I love GOOD CHARLOTTE FOR LIFE!"
1,Just horrible,"I think i will need an ear cirgury if i hear this cd again. THis is no music, its like a bunch of crazy peole singing to get crazy stupid inmature fans. I just cant stand hearing this cd, please, im serious this music is awful."
4,Good Charlotte - the young and the hopeless,"the new good charlotte album is different than a lot of stuff that's out there now. there is a range of songs from ballads to make you wanna jump up and down songs. their songs are really good and pretty meaningful. some of the best songs are tracks 4, 9, 10, and 12. [wondering, riot girl, say anything, and the young and the hopeless]. i would recommend this album to anyone who likes punky-power pop."
5,best cd ever,"ok, im obviously a Good Charlotte fan so i have nothing but good things to say about the Young And The Hopeless C.D. honestly though even if youre not a fan their lyrics are so heart filled to the hard times they have encountered. i think they are by far great artists and this album/c.d. is proof of it. and even if you arent in to the whole punk/rock scene at least give Good Charlotte's, The Young And The Hopeless a shot...trust me its worth it!! I LOVE GOOD CHARLOTTE!!"
1,I'd give it a zero if I could,"How you little posers can listen to this garbage confuses me. These guys are not punk, just worthless little sellouts appealing to all the stupid teens in the world and their unawareness of what punk really is. Listen to Sex Pistols, The Ramones, or Pennywise. Your time will be better spent than with this filth."
1,My How Rock Has Degraded,"Into this junk they call rock. This review is aimed at all you kids who think bands like this, Simple Plan, Dashboard Confessional, Sum 41, Avril Lavigne, etc. are ""REAL"" punk bands. Well all you little ones, I have some news for you.... THESE BANDS ARE NOT PUNK!!!!!!!! THEY ARE POP, EMO JUNK. Just take the Backstreet Boys and give them guitars and black clothes and what do you have? GOOD CHARLOTTE!Please, for the sake of rock and roll, don't listen to this garbage. Listen to some real rock and metal like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, In Flames, or Rammstein. My e-mail is Auragorn@aol.com, send me hate mail, hahaha."
1,"The ""Poison"" of 2000","Good Charlotte is to punk (or even pop-punk, for that matter) what Poison is to metal, only GC doesn't apply their mascara as well. Maybe Bret Michaels can give Benji some tips at the next ""Where are they now?"" convention. This band is one more crappy CD away from the cut-out bin. Believe it."
1,Muppet babies of Punk,That's a quote from Ed the Sock by the way...Anyway these guys are nothing but Corporate punk... They will be forgottem pretty quickly.What bothers me the most is how the guitar players wears Alice Cooper make up and probably gives him no props for the idea. There is nothing original in their make-up or music! Very lame album from a very lame band.'Hold On' to your 6 months of fame fellas.
1,a big fat emo turd,I would rather go get a coffee enema than sit through this formulaic mainstream bs. This is the garbage that Rolling Stone magazine and the record industry is peddling to the pimple faced emo kid who goes to buy the album from the band he just saw on MTV(sic).
4,good,i loved this cd when it first came out. i was a young teen at the time and just starting guitar it had a lot of cool guitar parts. honestly i should give this cd a chance again. sure its not amazing but the songs were pretty solid and they are certainly better than what good charlotte is now.
2,Doesn't hold up,"I'm listening to this album again as I review it. If this was five years ago it would have received five stars. That being said this album really doesn't hold up. Time is it's enemy. This band is embarassing and weak. However, they were a sign of the times and still have a good melody. I just can't seem to take the band seriously anymore. Times change and for this band they've kinda of went backwards. It makes me really respect bands from the 1960's where the music holds up forty years later whereas this doesn't. I'm not a hater because I own most of their albums. This is by far their best album. Don't get me wrong, there are some catchy songs on here. But, you have to look at the big picture here, overall it's embarassing."
1,worst band in the entire universe in all its entirety,"Since I'm the prime age group for Good Charlotte, or ""GC"" if you're a teeny bopper, I bought this album thanks to the encouragement of my friends. I am now beginning to recover after listening constantly to Greenday, Pennywise, The Suicide Machines, Rancid, the Ramones, and the one and only Sex Pistols. The teeny boppers who listen to this and think they are rebbels sadden me. Punk is about independent thought, and standing strong against the man. All the Good Charlotte fans are way too late to do this. They are just copying like they always do."
1,"WORST ""BAND"" EVER","First off, let me just say how I am amused to see how this review section has become a GC bashing place.Anyways, just to emphasize what most of the other reviews say, GC isn't punk, ""pop-punk"" isn't a category, MTV has ruined mainstream music, people that say GC is ""punk"" are just blonde cheerleaders and Avril Lavigne wannabes that have sub-human mental capacity, so, can you really blame them for getting the facts mixed up?Also, GC fans, quit saying this band is talented, because they are not, and I bet all of you don't know what a scale or arpeggio is even if your life depended on it.If you want simple three-chord rock that's good, get any MISFITS album, because they are three-chord rock, and they are better than GC...oh, wait a minute, they are not better, they are actually good, unlike GC, the most talent lacking band ever.How they have so many fans baffles me.In closing, if these guys still have their homes a few years from now, there is no justice in the world."
1,Good Charlette Sux Nuts,"If I were to describe how much good charlette [...] I would have to gather all the crap rock groups: simple plan, NFG, Blink 182, etc together, give them out of tune guitars, and have them screem at the top of their lungs playing gay little power chords. Come on, people punk rock sux. Oh yeah I hated this song also.And PS: if all you [...] little possy girls want real music buy tool, ACDC, Nirvanna, Incubus, Rage against the machine. theres better stuff out there. bye"
1,not again!,"It has hapened again. This cd just persuaded 1.5 million cheerleaders that they are punk. It is very sad and depressing to see what the world has come to. GC's first cd was not that bad. Their POP-punk sound was rather catchy. I could say that they sold out on this one, but the truth is they were sold out from the beginning....They are the punk music for the TRL lovers. In my opinion, when you have girls on TRL crying out of pure love for you, you have hit rock bottom. Leave the music business now and change your identity before the situation gets any worse. botton line, if you are looking for a pop band that can't play music or write that well, but looks very harcore, buy this cd. If you are looking for good music, don't."
1,YOU WANT PAIN?!?!,"(Actually 0)This is truthfully one of the most painful and depressing albums that I've ever come across. Pop...Punk...Rap something I dont know. It's just bad. Their first single is ""Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous"" they use their lyrical ::genius:: to bash rich people(which they are by the way) for haveing so much money...these guys need to find some other motivation. Thats like Gary Coleman comeing out with a new rap CD dissing short people on every track.After a few filler songs then we get to the next big single ""The Anthem"", I got sick of this song after I heard it on Madden 2003. It's stupid, pointless and utterly a waste of time. The entire album is a waste of time and money don't buy this.""The Young and the Hopeless"" is a nice, fitting title for this score. Because that is exactly what I think of Good Charlotte's career and this CD. Hopeless.Dont buy this."
4,Almost but not quite,"I really LIKED this cd, and the only reason I did not love it is it a little on the ""popish"" side. I love most of the songs [i.e. The Anthem and My Bloody Valentine], but the over-all tone seems to be untrue to GC's image. I encourage anyone and everyone to buy the CD. But if your a true punk rocker don't be too surprised if you don't like a few[if not many] of the songs."
2,SELL OUTS,"i would give this cd a 4 but doods good charlotte has sold out so much ever since theyve gotten all mainstream. i used to be a really good fan. then i saw them in concert and they were just alright, granted joel said he had a cold. then they made the video for the anthem(2nd best song on the cd to story of my old man) and it was totally ghetto and [bad]. they were a really kick [butt] band but so far they havnt handle their fame very well with being on MTV and stuff. they have let down their fans who have been there since back in 97' when nobody knew who the ... they were."
1,I'm always complaining when this junk comes on the radio.,"I would never buy this album, or any othe album by good charlotte, or any of those awful EMO bands. this isn't punk, it's garbage. You wanna hear real punk, listen to the Ramones, Clash, Sex Pistols or The Stooges. Hopefully this horrendous band will fade into oblivion as quickly as possible"
1,Piece of s---!,"I don't consider this to be music, its sounds like something thrown together within 10 seconds.. No catchy sound, I recommend saving your money and buying some other CD thats real music, or just real punk rock like Afi. .."
1,Jack,"Worst CD ive heard, possibly the worst CD of ALL TIME! These guys used to cut my hair in the Annapolis Mall. I remember them,as people there actually alright. As artists THEY SUCK! but like i said....there pretty cool people, id know, they cut my many times"
5,The alblum shows musical growth,"Its a great day in the musical industry when there are performers such as Good Charlotte. When speaking of talent, this band has an abundance of it. Breaking down their lives, and laying it out for other kids to relate to is what music is all about. Giving the consumer something real, something to relate to. The new cd shows musical growth from the last self entitled cd, Good Charlotte. They used more instruments,different styles, and adult lryics. Its down to earth and rich, yet it gives die hard GC fans some new flavor, and catches the eye of other music fans. Myself, being a fan of Good Charlotte, and the guys,(Joel, Benji, Billy, and Paul) I give this cd a hell yea, and two thumbs up. So music lovers if you haven't bought it, or burnt it, do it. Don't miss out on this musical experience.~mAD LoVe~"
1,mmm smells like crap,"On one awful day, I was exposed to this horrible CD by my ""Avril-loving"" friend. Im not going to have a whole lecture about how bad it was but, don't buy into all this punk wannabe stuff. Good Charlotte is N'sync with Chuck taylors on and dyed hair ."
3,Posers,"This cd is the worse case of somebody pretending to be what they arent I have ever seen in my life. This is nothing like Good Charlotte's first cd, which I actually liked. The songs on this cd are decent, and some of them are actually on the border line of good, and this cd also has great production to make the crapppy musicians sound better. This cd was made strictly to appeal to the younger TRL crowd and they did a good job at doing that, unfortunately it pissed of many people because they are trying to convey this ""punk"" image. Now all the kiddies out there think its cool to be like Good Charlotte and they have started dressing like their musical idols and listening to the music and now my airwaves are polluted with pop/punk crapola. Thanks Good Charlotte for ruining a whole genre of music."
5,Another Excellent CD!!!,"I really really like GC's first CD but this CD is a lot better!!! It has shown that they have grown though the years!!! They have many good songs and riffs on this cd!!! My favorite song is ""The Anthem"" which is an anthem to be your self and not follow the crowds!!! I like all the other songs too!!! but the Anthem just sticks out to me!!! Get this CD it's awesome!!!"
1,Lame,"Banking on the notion that the ""kids"" won't know anything alternative past Nirvana's ""Nevermind"", Good Charlotte continues to raid riffs and ideas from late 70's/early 80's punk and new wave. For Example: ""lifestyles"" rips off Iggy Pop's ""Lust For Life"" blatantly..old Clash and Damned (riffs) abound as well all in service to the usual subjects these frustrated alt-rock social workers pound into the ground relentlessly.Joel and Benji Madden push this social worker type rightousness by being MTV media darlings..nice looks never hurt such things of course...especially when they wanna be oh so relevant.This has all been done before, all been said before, and much, much better by others. This is strident, repetitive, predictable, self-rightously preachy and overall in a word, lame."
5,Left Emotionless,"Good Charlotte's new release ""the Young and the Hopeless"" is great. I was going crazy when I picked up the last copy at the mall, and I was the only one around that had it. I have to admit that it wasn't quite as good as their self titled album, only because it lacked the energetic songs that the first had. The songs are very deep and I can relate to a lot of the things that they are saying. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
4,A great book to read in a public place...,"... because it will make you laugh outloud. Davy has a wonderful way with words, as well as a real knack for storytelling. I ended up taking a Saturday and reading it, then had my lady-friend read it, then I re-read it. Great stuff."
4,A solid debut,"Davy Rothbart is best known as the personable and fun-loving founder of Found Magazine. I once saw him during a speaking tour in which he and his brother criss-crossed the country in an old van, sharing their favorite found items that people had submitted to the magazine.I wasn't sure what to expect from this thin collection of short stories. I figured they'd be weird and funny, but was surprised at how solid they were throughout. The language is simple, and the stories are quirky and surprising without being silly. There's some real depth here, and Davy shows some chops. My favorite stories are the title story and ""Elena,"" about a boy's infatuation with a Mexican prostitute."
3,for white boys that think they're channeling Tupac and Kerouac,"A decent but not terribly impressive or memorable werk; I think there is a spark of talent buried in there and I hope it matures. This little collection has a few fleeting moments of brilliance but overall doesn't linger with much substance. For every passage that suggests depth and insight, there are two on each side that feel vapid -- heavy on the style, like he's searching for his voice and spends too much time imitating others."
3,"If you're already a Davy Rothbart fan, you'll like it","Anyone who has heard or seen Rothbart as part of This American Life or in his appearances for his magazine ""Found"" knows that his voice and demeanor are inviting and unassuming, perfect for narrating the kind of stories he likes to tell - those that revolve around the everyday and mundane. One of the stories from this collection, ""How I Got Here,"" takes the form of a found essay - an inmate's response to a writing assignment. This story probably comes closest to achieving what Rothbart's more familiar work does, but some of the other pieces here fall a little short of the mark.There is definitely promise in this collection, and Rothbart has a fantastic eye for the great moments of the everyday, but unless you allow yourself to ""hear"" him read these, you might find them a little disappointing."
4,Tought stuff,"This material assumes a lot of previous knowledge in the field. It is really difficult to grasp reading cover to cover. However, once you get the hang of it, McCarthy does a great job of demonstrating the theory at work."
3,"nice, but oh so loud","My son got this a year ago for his 2nd birthday. At first he loved the noises it made when the trains went through the tunnel. After the novelty wore off, he told us HE thought it was too loud(IT IS), so we took the batteries out of it. He enjoys playing with it, but it is tricky to incorporate into the track design because it is pretty wide (actual track is several inches from edge of table). For the money, I would purchase something that is more versatile. We do love our BRIO, though!"
3,Many trains won't fit,"My son has several trains that won't fit through the tunnel: Chugginton, Melissa and Doug, and others. Made for a frustrated three year old."
4,Much smaller than anticipated...,"I think this tunnel will be really neat to add to our train table for my sons Christmas gift. Although it arrived MUCH smaller than we had anticipated, it still appears to be well made and I think my son will still get a kick out of using it."
2,disappointing given author,Steven Ford is one of the best artists in polymer clay. This book was a disappointment. If it had only been a picture book of his work over 20 years it would have been a treasure. Not so.
4,Incredible book...,"Despite sub-par maps, numerous typos and a very rough translation, this book is a must read for any student of the Eastern Front. Never before have I read such a detailed anaylsis of joint German/Hungarian military matters in 1945. Topics covered include poltical relations between the Germans and the Hungarian fascists, the ""Final Holocaust"", the economic/political realites of oil and war, and the final destruction of the Waffen-SS in its last deperate counterattacks.One of the best books I have ever read regarding these mostly ignored chapters of World War II."
1,Politically Correct Pap,"Dull, over-wrought and wrong about every subject it covers. You can bet your botton dollar that the author of this one-sided diatribe wasn't a jock when he was growing up. If you hate the suburbs, buy this book and all your prejudices will be confirmed but you will not learn anything new. And, yeah, I was a Jersy kid and went to high school nearby (Montclair) in 1957-61. Not recommended, to say the least (the book, that is)."
3,A different world,"This is hardly the Glen Ridge I knew when growing up there from 1932 to 1946, playing in CartEret Park (misspelled throughout this book) and going to both Linden Avenue School and Glen Ridge High.My contemporaries included a remarkable collection of athletes (not including me). In fact, our Group I football team beat Montclair (the Group IV champions) and was named the best team in the entire state. This feat will never be duplicated going forward.PerhapsTHESE guys had talent in athletics because they were not distracted by girls or indeed anything else. The sort of incident described by Lefkowitz would be unthinkable in my day.If Glen Ridge has changed so radically it must be reflecting a reprehensible societal shift."
2,Ultimately a disappointment,"I'm a big fan of true crime books and the glowing reviews of this one made it look enticing. Unfortunately, it's nowhere near as good as the reviews here suggest. It is a promising topic - the gang rape of a retarded girl by a group of moneyed jocks - but it's just not engrossing. The book can't seem to make up its mind what it wants to be - journalism or sociology. So it fails as both. Frankly, it's appallingly edited, and is overlong by several hundred pages (it would have made a good pithy New Yorker article). There's a lot of amateur sociological speculation. The characters are not finely drawn (the author thinks research is a good subsititute). Just when a part gets interesting, more dry pseudo-analysis bogs it down. It is occasionally interesting, and eventually you get the facts of the case. But it's not very well written and is best read if you're interested in the subject rather than fine journalism."
5,Our Guys is an excellent book,This book starts out very slow but it all makes sense once you get towards the ending. This book is great for everyone who has been through high school and remembers how the popular people got away with just about anything. This book lets you see how the jocks do horrible things to other kids in school and everyone is afraid to tell on them. This book really lets you look into the minds of parents who think their kids are perfect. I really enjoyed this book and am amazed at the ending.
4,"Scholarly, meticulously-researched, account of injustice","Lefkowitz has chosen to not only put a group of coddled, privileged young men up to scrutiny but also the town, Glen Ridge, New Jersey, which created them. Riveting reading from first to last. Much more than a ""true crime"" narrative. It's a case history of an abominable rape of a mentally defective teenager by a group of high school heroes."
1,"CH-RDV 2000 by Cyber Home, lacking quality","I returned this product after playing a half does or so DVD's. I had it hooked to a 1996 27' Sharp via composite yellow cable. I played a half dozen or so DVD's, most brand new. The picture 'flickered' at scene changes. This was very annoying. Some DVD's were worse ( flickering at almost every scene change) than others (flckering 4-5 times per movie). I never got around to recording or even playing cds because the DVD playback was unaceptable. Made in China. Their US customer support was difficult to locate and could not help."
1,It stinks and the company is totally non-responsive.,If I could rate it less than one star - I would. The product didn't work from the beginning. We followed the instructions to the letter. The product was a total waste of money and the company never responded to numerous emails. PS-Didn't get it at Amazon.
2,"Eh, it's ok","When there are bright white scenes in the movie, the player will not read it and the screen goes black. This is kinda annoying. I have burned CD's with it and it does a good job. You cant switch the CD out and pick songs off another one and burn them though. You have to record the entire CD for it to work. Not my first choice for a product but what did I expect for 150 dollars"
1,The 2500 model,"I purchased the 2500 model... and right out of the box had an array of problems. ....Second, it was impossible for me to add chapters.Third, and most annoying, this model's make compatible command does not work and therefore recorded DVDs cannot be read by other DVD players.Fourth, Cyberhome does NOT respond to email."
4,Very elegant!,"This is my first Charles by Charles David shoe. The material is good, the size too. The only uncomfortable issue was the open toe side, but it after 3 days using them it was ok.Very nice shoe but definetly it is not a $100 dollars one, if you pay less than $50 will be fair."
4,A Hit but may not be for sensitive kids,"What a wonderful family movie. My 9 yr. old daughter loves animals and this movie is a favorite of hers. Her favorite part is when Free Willy is let go to his real home. As much as I absolutely love this movie I have to think about my 11 yr. old that is very sensitive and does not like how Free Willy was caught in the beginning. I will never find him watching this movie, so this movie may not be for your sensitive child. It is still a wonderful family movie where no one has to worry about what's on the screen. Who can say that anymore?"
3,If you take it as fantasy...,"The odd thing about Free Willy is that it's a film which makes money using a captive animal to do tricks--and it's about the evils of capturing animals to do tricks for money. The film came out at the same time as and with the same mentality of its partner-in-ideology Jurassic Park (using technology to make money by condemning the use of technology to make money).If you can get over that, it's a beautiful piece of work. The best part is Basil Poledouris' wonderous score, which should have been released on its own without all the clutter of pop songs."
4,Free Willy DVD,The DVD was received on time and the grandson liked it. I have not heard as to how it played.Thank you.
3,D+,"While it's not a good film,it's also not a bad film.I do like the message of no one should be held against their will and no animal should ever be treated badly but it's still a rehash of previous films about a boy bonding with an animal.I totally hate the scene where Willy jumps over the boy on a bed of rocks.If he could jump that high,why could'nt he jump over the low net blocking his path instead? I also hate Willy's calling for his family.it sounds like Curly Joe getting kick in the you-know-what.The only other reason this film is famous is becuase of Michael Jackson's song:""Will You Be There?"" I gvie film a 5 out of 10."
3,Optimization,"Great movie but not optimized for big screen tvs. 6"" on top and bottom of black bars. They should tell you this before you buy it."
1,Not a great movie at all,I dont see why a person will want to go through all that trouble to save a whale. My opinion on this movie was that it was a wast of time. Its a whale that a kid tryes to save. Not a good movie at all.
1,stupid whale,Went in to too much trouble to save the whale. The kid did. They should of killed the whale and ate it.
3,DECENT FAMILY FILM! IF YOU LIKE FLIPPER.........,"Well, I can finally say I saw 'Free Willy'! Family friendly film with a simple story. It's easy to watch and it will keep the kids happy. I bought the triple feature with all 3 films for under $10.00, it's hard to go wrong for that price! The DVD set has very good transfers for all 3 films."
3,Door not secure,"Probably the only Brio item I haven't given 5 stars too. Like the other reviewer, I picked this up (& many other things) at Tuesday Morning for next to nothing.It's a pretty good car, my only problem is in a very short time, the door ""catch"" has worn out (& now it opens too easy... I'll probabaly just super glue it shut)."
5,Historically and Scripturally Enlightened,Having been a Baptist all of my life I found Dr. Phillips' book to be very challenging. I found myself searching the scriptures and prayerfully considering the content. I must say that when I place the Bible beside Dr. Phillips' book I can find nothing but truth. I believe Awakened by the Spirit to be the most historically and scripturally accurate treatise on the Holy Spirit and His work in the New Testament Church in the past several decades. I believe his kind but honest approach toward cessationism exposes it as the greatest apostasy in the 20th century church. I appreciate His transparancy and his honesty. Thank you Dr. Phillips for helping the 21st Century Church return to Her spiritual roots. I highly reccommend this book to those who are seeking the truth about the work of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament Church.
5,"GIORGIA, GIORGIA, GIORGIA","WHAT CAN I SAY... GIORGIA, OH MY GOSH, SHE IS LIKE SO SKILLED. JUST THE GREATEST TALENTED SINGER I HAVE ""EVER HEARD"" NEXT TO LAURA PAUSINI AND LARA FABIAN OF COURSE. BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS A NOTE THAT GIORGIA CAN NOT HIT. SHE IS THE BEST. THIS ALBUM IS SO GREAT, IN MY TASTE. I AM TOTALLY GLAD THAT I HAVE PURCHASED IT."
4,italian music is just great,"I was looking for that one song ""tutto é possibile""(everything is possible) for years and finally I have the whole CD, yeah!!!Love Italian Music!"
5,great practice tool,"Learning to deal with these tempos is important even if you don't want to play this fast. Learn to relax with the tempo this high and you've learned to relax - full stop. Of course, learning to relax whilst playing is the most important thing of all. Good luck."
4,An intriguing read,"This entry in the Brother Cadfael series presents a more complex tale of good, evil, and the grey area in between, than often is the case in this series. There is the usual happy ending in terms of the young couple united in the course of the story, but the resolution of the guilty party is surprising and somewhat unsettling."
3,#17 an' still going strong?,"The Pillars of the EarthIn the Brother Caedfael mysteries we get a very differentlook at life in the 12th century from that given by Ken Follett.In some ways I think Follett captured the feel of ""life"" betterin his failed historical novel than Ellis Peters does in his admittedly successful series?We get a very different take on the local royalty and how they interacted with their peasants in a feudal setting.In this novel someone dead and unsuspected is the plot twist"
5,A Must See Film,"""Your Mother Wears Combat Boots"" is the hilarious film about an over protective Mother (Eden) who runs her sons (Elizondo) life. After dropping her son off at college she learns he has joined the military. Following some crazy events she too ends up in the military as well, trying to get him to drop out. This is wear it gets hilarious as she doesn't understand Military laws or rules. It is as if she is in her own little world. This makes for a very, very funny film. I highly recommend it to all. It is a must see film and a must own for your DVD collection!I first saw this film on TV back in the early 90's when I stayed home sick from school. I have never seen it on TV since but I have never forgotten how funny it is. I now own it."
1,Better than some of the old time stuff.,"Not great, but better than some of Eden's old stuff. I would five it more stars but I do not want to lead you on. You might watch it once a decade."
3,Barbara Eden - in the army,"I enjoyed the film quite a bit. Barbara and the cast are most enjoyable and she shows her comedic abilities to the max, but the dvd production is somewhat lacking. My copy has very long spaces which are the commercials from the TV production and its not very digitally remastered. The disk won't let you advance to the next scene and has no other features of any kind other than the basic film. I wondered whether it was a copy rather than a professional release."
2,NO VARIETY,"All the songs on this cd sound the same--like a dance mix. If you want to jump around for an hour or so, you may like it, but if you want some variety, get a different cd."
5,This book is a MUST for all parents.,"I have read SO many parenting books and this one rates up in the top 3, along with Parenting with Love and Logic and Raising Your Spirited Child. This book isn't just for parents of defiant/aggressive kids but for all parents. It is comprehensive, but simple to read without alot of redundancy to wade through. The author doesn't have any elaborate, complicated plans for you to follow, just practical, realistic but excellent parenting advice. If you are ready to follow his guidelines, you are ready to have a closer and healthier relationship with your child."
5,Great for the RV,This unit has worked very well in both very hot and very cold weather in the RV for over five years. I was told that these monitors should be replaced every 6 or 7 years so I am replacing it and am happy to see that this model is still available. It works and you never know it is there until you perform the periodic test.
1,Died after 1 month in service,This product died after 1 month. 2 beeps every 30 seconds. I changed out the battery with a new Energizer and the same 2 beeps every 30 seconds came back.
2,OK Product but Not Too Durible,"I purchased this item to replace the CO2 alarm in my RV. The original lasted only about 2-years when it started ""chirping"" at odd times. I changed the batteries but the chirping continued - not all the time, but often enough to be unreliable. Why the manufacturer indicates that the useful life is >5 years seems to be inaccurate."
2,Too Esoteric,"I had high hopes for this book, and though I consider myself fairly well-read, this book is either: 1. Very confusingly written, or 2. It's written for an audience of educated astronomers, certainly not for the novice. Once in a great while I find a book that I simply cannot wrap my head around, and this was one of them. If you're not an astronomer, I'd pass on this one."
2,Roc Retinol,Don't waste your money. This stuff does not work. I bought it based on other reviews. I'm telling you not to spend your money!
3,deep wrinkle cream,I used it a couple of times...it was delivered on time and was reasonably priced...I dont' use it more than once a week because it has a perfume smell that affects my asthma and it burns.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this product because of all the positive reviews. When I recieved it,I was very disappointed to find it is not fragrance free. After I applied it, I became congested and then it triggered a migraine. I wasted my money."
2,NOT THAT GREAT,"This product doesn't work any better than the other more reasonable products out there with the same results, very little difference in moisturizing for the face. I would not waste my money."
1,Did not help at all,The same thing happened to me that happened to This aged me ten years. I had some stinging but that went away and then I noticed the wrinkles and flaky skin under my eyes. My eyes even where swelling up in the morning. It took a few days for that to stop. My side affects took about two weeks.
2,"Toshiba 65"" DLP - Great TV but major problem","I purchased a DLP Toshiba (65HM167) 65"" tv ON 11/1/2007. I have used Toshiba products in the past with no problems. But in 2009 my lamp unit (light for tv) went out. I have a service plan on the tv and it was replaced. If I did not it would have cost me $300. Well it has not been a year and the lamp went out again. Do not buy this tv. It has a on going problem with the same part going out."
5,"Nice Picture on this 65"" Set","First let me say I am a Toshiba fan. I have 3 other Toshiba tube units, one 15 years old and still running.So far so good very good picture and a pleasure to watch. I bought mine late November 2007 and added a HD Sat Receiver mid December. To really appreciate this set you must have a HD receiver pushing HD. If you are not watching HD then you are stretching your standard def picture to 65"".This unit has 3 HDMI inputs that makes playing XBox 360 and Playstation 3 a very easy experience switching sources and one HDMI for other expansion.Now if I do not run into bulb issues this set will be perfect."
3,"Amazing purchase, but MAJOR lamp problems",I purchased this TV and before I even got it I was very nervous about the size of it. I thought it would for sure ver whelm my living room. Well today I received it and I must say not only is the picture beautiful but the tv itself is truly fabulous.Updated 07/26/10 I have had this tv now for a few years and there is obviously major lamp problems I am on my 2nd lamp replacement and it makes a snapping and popping noise often. Pleasebe aware of the constant costly maitnence this item isseaming to be.
5,Very helpful.,"I was having a very difficult time dealing with the loss of our cat, Snoopy. I needed assurance that I would see him again. This book really made it clear that God does extend His salvation to all living things, including our pets. I recommend this to anyone who has lost a pet and wants answers from a biblical perspective.-Adam"
4,Such a comfort.....,"Thank you, Niki, for your book ""There is Eternal Life for Animals."" My life> is intertwined with that of animals...I have 10 dogs ( all strays at one> time), 5 cats, 3 horses, and 2 birds. I cannot imagine a heavenly life in> the hereafter without the animal kingdom and pray that I will be blessed> with the company of the creatures I love someday. Just yesterday I found> that a wonderful stray dog (that I had been feeding for some time but could> not adopt) had died unexpectedly - there are many in this part of rural> Georgia - and my heart aches for him. I turned to your book again and read> some comforting passages from it to help ease my despair. Thank you again> and God bless you.>> Sincerely,>> Irina Jocher"
2,"The book was OKAY, but I preferred other titles on the topic.","After my sweet dear Golden Retriever companion died at 14 1/2 years old, I was sobbing. I read every book out there that was about animals and their eternal life. This book was cute and endearing, but did not have the substance and essence that enlightened me inside to have comfort, providing me the solace I needed to KNOW that my dog Lady will meet me when I pass over.There were many other books I read on the subject that were fantastic, but the one book that stands out the most for me was ""Cold Noses at the Pearly Gates"" by Gary Kurz. Another one was ""Will I See Fido in Heaven"" by Mary Buddemeyer. There were many others."
5,From One Who Has Lost Too Many.,As the operator of a cat shelter I understand more than many the pain that goes with the loss of an animal companion. All that come through our doors become our companions; some for only a brief time and some for a long time. Many enter ill from natural illnesses and live their last days with us. Many enter with illness resulting from abuse. Their lives are usually brief. The best we can do for them is to love them to the end and to kiss them goodbye when they enter their next level of life. I personally believe in a life after for humans and animals. I believe for animals the life after is combination of calm and peace that was never truly felt in their first life. I believe the calm is a feeling of being safe. I believe the peace is a feeling of belonging. I thank Niki for letting her heart write for all animals with the same love her heart had for the animals that were her own.
5,A wonderful feeling to know I'll see my fur-kids again someday!,"I just finished your book, There is Eternal Life For Animals. I discovered many verses in the Bible I either didn't know existed or looked at them in a new light. I didn't just read your book, but I studied it, carefully examining every word. What a wonderful feeling to know I wil see my fur-kids"" again someday."
4,"Pet-lovers, take heart!","For those of us that believe in life after death and count on enjoying eternity with out loved ones, the question invariably comes up as to whether or not our furry (or scaly or feathery, as it were) family members will also be there. Niki Shanahan does an excellent job addressing this concern, expounding upon many passages from scripture with innovative insights as to why we WILL see our pets in the next world. Intermingled are cute anecdotes about her own pets, making the book a delight to read, as well as a comfort.Christian or not, most of us would agree death is not truly the end; if you consider your pets beloved family members and would like some reassurance as to their individual importance, ""There Is Eternal Life For Animals"" is must-read."
5,There Is Eternal Life For Animals Book,At the time my husband bought this for me. It was soon assuring to me and helped me know that what I believed about animals living again was true.I have lost Three baby animals and it is so hard to accept when you are a puppy mommie.
2,Not what I was looking for,"First of all, when I received this book in the mail, I didn't feel it was worth the price due to its size. After reading it, I didn't feel any better. Some of the Bible verses she uses doesn't even have anything to do with animals. It's like she's grasping or trying to make it into something else. I grew up in a Southern Baptist church and have enough experience with those people who manipulate the Scripture to fit them. I work with one of these people now and he flat out told me my cat is NOT in heaven, that God doesn't love animals like that. He looked at this book and said as a woman Shanahan doesn't have the authority to be writing about God! So regardless of what he thinks, I didn't find comfort in this book."
5,Helped Me Through The Biggest Heartbreak In My Life,"Chloe, my three year old cocker spaniel got very sick and had a stroke and had to be put down. I was totally devastated. This was worse than loosing my Mom. This book taught me that God does have a place for our pets.(companions) All living creatures have a soul. I now know that Chloe was an angel in disguise sent to me to help me win my battle against cancer. The author uses scripture from the Bible and proves her point that God does use animals to reach us. I am a 63 year old man and I highly recommend this book. Help ease your pain and buy this book."
5,excellent book,"I have always believed that our pets, all animals in fact, will be with us in Heaven. Niki did a wonderful job of researching Biblical statements to support my belief. This book will serve as a comfort for anyone who has lost a dear furry or scaly or feathered friend."
4,excellent,"Quatermass is pretty straight forward rock--which does not mean it is not pretty interesting.The grab here is the lack of guitar. Quatermass bass all their tracks on the keybord. This does not mean it is prog in the ELP sense. There is no flash here, no classical gas solos.The music is actually more akin to Deep Purple's ""Child In Time,"" dark gothic hard rock, right at the edge of psych beomming progressive--before areana hijinx took over mainstreem FM art rock and turned it into a circus act.This is excellent--a real slice of forward thinking 1960s music."
4,my review part two,"I neglected to mention that unlike ELP, this band has the ability to keep a (heavy) beat.Typical rock sound for 1970.Along the lines of Bloodrock or Uriah Heep-minus the guitars of course."
5,I'm the black sheep of the family,"This album is AWESOME! This album has a different range of music, anything from Led Zeppelin, King Crimson and Emerson, Lake and Palmer, it's hard to believe that hardly anybody has ever heard of this band and this album should be alot easier to find than it is cause it's that excellent, what's amazing is that there is no guitar player on this album and Quatermass is one of the best power trios out there.My favorite song on this album is Black Sheep of the Family, Gemini and the instrumental Laughin' Tackle.If you love King Crimson, Led Zeppelin, The Who, ELP and Deep Purple, then you should get this album, don't be afraid to get it cause it's a great album, and the liner notes are also a bonus."
3,Mixed emotions,"Sounds like ELP plus Grand Funk vocalist with some keyboards ""a la"" Pink Floyd. That mix could be horrible, but not. It's Good. Quite Good"
3,An interesting story,"In this score, the talented actor Takeshi Kaneshiro, even in his early career, reveals his talent and love for what he does. It's a must see, since it's a story of internal quest about the way we should live our life without spending it worthlessly."
1,Horrible,"I like Mira, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. How in the world she got involved in this production (including a couple of cast members from the mini-series, The Sopranos...which, BTW, do horrible acting), is beyond me! The 4 and 5 star ratings on this vid were the reason I purchased it. One man's poison is another man's treasure, but this 'dog' is just that: a Dog!"
5,Through the Eyes of John Pechacek,"I have to admit, I read this book in one sitting. Not because of it's length. Not because of the attractive cover art. But because the book tells it like it is, no holds barred, the truth and only the truth. As I read through, from beginning to end, I found myself laughing out loud. Everything people have perhaps noticed at one time yet were afraid to talk about in public for fear that one would be labeled ""strange"" for such thoughts, such observations. It's about time someone put these types of thoughts on paper!In a world of endless Self Help books, John's book is a relief. It is fun to read, tough to put down, and impossible not to laugh as you turn each page."
4,compact,"I kept this in my coat pocket my entire trip, easy to use map with compass, never needed to use the pen but nice to know I had it. Written guides very useful."
3,Song is a bit loud and overwhelming,"The book is just okay. I feel the song is a little bit loud and overwhelming and long. It doesn't really give you a chance to read the book because the song keeps playing. I have a feeling that the book can become annoying in the hands of a little one......no off button! My kids did like it though. It is a descent book for the money, but just be prepared to hear the song multiple times!"
3,Just OK,The one I rec'd has a pump that never worked properly. But the product works for a few hrs and helps some.
4,Kawabata Makoto - 'O Si Amos A Sighire A Essere Duas Umbras' (Important) 4 1/2 stars,"Here's a solo effort from the main player of Acid Mothers Temple where Makoto pays personal tribute to a spiritual climax he'd apparently encountered a couple of years ago. Two tracks include ""Ses Aintro 'E Mene Finzas Si Ses in S ' Atter ' Ala E Su Mundu"" (32:30) which features extended - random guitar picking - about halfway through the song develops into Hawkwind's ""You Know You're only Dreaming"" and title cut ""O Si Amos A Sighire A Essere Duas Umbras"" (43:09) that is not only beautifully played - but is a quite lengthy piece of superb psyched-out bliss. Music here is DEEP and very enlightening. Ambient fans will be drooling over this pick. Essential."
3,Cliche Story of Black America in the 1950's,"I kept thinking something new and original would happen, but it didn't. The characters are very stereotpyical; the courage of moving into a white neighborhood (that an aspect of the book deals with) is no different than what one would expect from any work of fiction about Black America. One character relationship I did find interesting was Beneatha and Lena (Mama). They have several interesting interaction/ conflicts over religion and Beneatha's looking for her African identity. Perhaps novel in its time, this work is outdated."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"the supporting characters are interesting but the main character is a complete bore and his supernatural sensory experiences are too. most scenes could have been edited down to half their length without losing any dialogue or action. the newspaper dude saying ""wanna buy yer own"" was funny though. he had a stupid voice. i thought this would be the dullest of the series and so far it has been."
3,"Not the best entry, not the worst....","I actually enjoyed watching this movie. It was well-casted and TRULY ORIGINAL! The plot is a little sketchy and there are only a few scares worth noticing. It is more of a psychological thriller, based on our views of other people in the outside world. It shows that you can fall in love with someone without knowing who they really are. It also shows the unpredictabilty of the unknown.I did enjoy watching this movie, but DON'T make the mistake of comparing any single Masters of Horror entry to another. They aren't pieces of a puzzle to be put together, they are all original.If you're looking for a decent thriller with some good twists, I suggest picking this one up."
2,Master waste of time,"I heard that Mick Garris is the creator of Masters of Horror. Then why not have a trully terrifying film presented to us. I am tired of watching movies that claim to be horror and are more of a suspense film. This would have been a perfect film for the ""Twilight Zone"", but not for ""Masters of Horror"". If you are expecting to be scared or are looking for something dark and dreary don't look here. I wouldn't want to waste your time expecting to see anything that resembles horror here. I have been disappointed so far by the ""Masters of Horror"" films. I was expecting more and was completly disappointed. If your going to claim to be a master of horror then please present us something that resembles horror at least. Look at the ""GhostHouse Underground collection"", or ""8 films to die for collection"". These films at least resemble horror films. Not all are great, but at least they are what they claim to be. Horror Movies."
2,Fell Short,"This one attempts to be a hefty psycho/charater study piece, but when all is said and done comes up pretty shallow. While I admire Garris for coming up with the Masters of Horror series (which I say overall has been great), I don't think anything he's done makes him a 'Master of Horror.'Chocolate is watchable, and sort of equates to an okay but forgettable Twilght Zone episode. The main character played by Henry Thomas in no way solicits sympathy nor any strong emotional attachment for that matter. The film leaves questions unanswered and offers up little in the way of brain candy, excitement or character development.Certainly one of the weaker installments, but again, if you have the time and desire then know what you're getting into."
5,Cannot wait to start using my Ultimate Photographer DVD,I have ordered the whole series of these DVDs beginning with Jump Start Your Photography and have ordered the Jump Start DVD for a friend because it is so useful. Manny is a natural when it comes to teaching and the DVD series has been more useful than any book or other instruction I have used. The DVDs are set up so you can actually see and understand techniques that will help you get photos right the first time. As my skills have increased my enjoyment has increased. The Ultimate Photographer builds on the first two DVDs and will undoubtedly increase my enjoyment even more as I continue to gain valuable and easily applicable information. Thanks Manny!
1,DVD player complains,"All the discs in this set do not play properly in my DVD player . Some produce no picture or sound , and all cause the player to make noises suggesting it will seize up at any moment . Return policies make it impossible to return this defective product fairly so I am stuck on this one ."
1,Defective disks,"None of the disks worked correctly in my DVD player. They each took upwards of 3 minutes to get to the menu screen, if at all. Then the movies would stop every 10 seconds for the DVD player to ""catch up"". I'm afraid all the constant loading/spinning will damage the DVD player.Do not buy."
1,"Awful quality, compressed into oblivion","These are absolutely not worth watching on anything larger than an 8"" portable DVD player. To fit so many movies on a few DVDs, they compressed the video data down dramatically. On a large screen, the video is flooded with artifacts, rendering the picture blocky and filled with noise. Plus the transfers themselves still retain the original film noise - these have not been professionally cleaned like the Criterion Collection releases. Save your $5 at Walmart, and instead buy The Lady Vanishes (Criterion edition) on eBay or Half.com for $5 - then you'll be getting your money's worth."
1,Don't waste your money,"It's not that the stories are not interesting. I ordered multiple copies as gifts. All have defective sections. In some cases the film starts and then gets hung up; in other cases the film will not start.No consistency, just poor quality when they were copied by the manufacturer.Due to the low price, I did not return them. There are enough other interesting Hitchcock films that can be viewed that make it worthwile to keep them.However, if you order, be prepared to not view some of the film's that are listed. Seems that some sort of quality control has to be implemented by Amazon to insure that films being ordered are of only the best quality."
1,Terrible quality. Defects in disks.,"I thought, ""you can't go wrong at this price."" Wrong. Several of the films on the DVD would not play. I exchanged it for a 2nd copy and at least 3 of the films were defective on that DVD and they wouldn't play either. I returned it for a refund--and I'm still waiting. A waste of money and time."
4,The Legend Begins...,Alfred Hitchcock - The Legend Begins is a great way to own some of the first films that Hitchcock ever directed. I purchased this at my local Walmart for $5 and it has been one of the best investments i've made in a long time. Specifically because The 39 Steps was on this collection made it all worthwhile. The quality of the discs are very good and the films themselves are well presented. 20 movies on 4 discs is a great value and the films are outstanding. Pick this one up.
3,Mainly older stuff,"This is a 4-DVD set, 5 shows per DVD, approximately 28 hours of Black and White Hitchcock shows, ranging from 1926 to 1962, and varying from 24 to 98 minutes each. Some are silent movies and some are from the weekly Hitchcock television series."
2,Not what I expected,First story was great. All the rest are like musicals with out talking. Was jumping from movie to movie. Previously gave good rating-not what I was expecting
2,Poor quality DVDs,"One of the four DVDs is not working at all.The movies are not remastered or anything, it's the original image and sound. The sound is especially bad. Unfortunately I am not very satisfied with this collection, although I am a big Hitchcock fan."
1,The Heresy Continues,"Leader James Dobson said that ""[The book] makes me want to throw up, pardon my language."" That was about Walsch's first book.This one is no different.The only truth is in the church."
5,Tomorrow's God,I haven't read this yet...just wanted to comment to the reader in TX. I'm thankful for you. You make all of us grow. I attempt to be more tolerant and accepting after reading your views. And the best part is: God loves you AND God loves me EVEN THOUGH OUR VIEWS ARE VERY DIFFERENT! Peace be with you!
5,Tomorrow's God,"Answer to all my questions and more I have bought about 10 books and 6 CD to give to friends and family, Pastors, Practioners, teachers, I love this book, I am so glad this book has been read by so many. There will be peace on earth when everone reads this book."
3,Walsch Offers Nothing New,"In ""Tomorrow's God,"" Walsch warns us early in his Introduction that ""You will find information in this book that is not new to you."" Indeed, very little, if anything, in this book is new to anyone who has read the Conversations with God books or any of Walsch's other books. Unfortunately, ""Tomorrow's God"" is nothing more than a rehashing of his other works.The only things that Walsch does differently here is promote other authors books (p.230) and provide a blue print for Socialism disguised as spirituality (p. 265-275). Walsch would do well to study modern history as such ideas have been attempted in some form or another and have all resulted in disaster.Save your money."
2,Almost perfect - but I may return it,"When I saw that Mikhail Pletnev recorded the Tchaikovsky Concerto #2 in DVD version, there were no second thoughts. I immediately ordered it and couldn't wait for it to arrive. Last night, I put it on and had a major disappointment. Although the sound is nearly perfect and the photography fantastic, in the Concerto the syncing was off! The sound of a crashing chord would be followed a second later by Pletnev's hand coming down on the chord.Perhaps this might not bother other people but I found myself looking away and just listening to his gorgeous playing. On the other hand, I bought a DVD to watch and not a CD to listen. The same problem may have been there in the symphonic works but it wasn't as noticeable as when watching a pianist up close. What a shame - this ruined an otherwise fantastic DVD for me."
2,"A few helpful tidbits, not much else","I originally bought this book because John Doerr was a ""co-author"". He only wrote the foreward, a few hundred words at most.Most of the book is filler and anecdotal examples, like ""a good vc is important, just look at Netscape...""The valuation section does does not really even talk about methodology, but gives a list of deals from the VentureOne database.About a quarter of the book is a venture capital directory. This will be moderately useful but there are plenty available on the web.The only real value I got out of the book is the interviews with some good VCs.This book had a lot of potential, but the value could be condensed into ten pages. I was disappointed in that I expected much more."
2,"Rolodex & personalities of VCs, but nothing in depth","I really wanted to like this book, since the subject needs updated attention. But it reads as if it was rushed to market (some typos, lots of jargon and repetition), contains many many pages of relatively useless charts (here is a list of 'Net companies that might or might not still be around; here is a list of famous VCs; here they are again and again; here is a list of money raised by round...) and little meaningful content (the valuation section -- key for the entrepreneur -- was a major disappointment). The interviews with Mr Harmon's VC friends and entrepreneurs were interesting and revealed a human side -- but nothing that was not already easy to get your hands on via magazines and newspaper articles. Mr Harmon seems like a really nice person as did all of the interviewees -- but know what you are looking for when you order this."
2,Nothing to write home about,"Despite the name recognition of those who sing the praises of this book (they are all in it) I found it nothing special. It seems more like a vehicle to get Harmon's name in lights now that he has left Internet.com and started his own shop.Alot of dated material and I agree with the other reviewer who indicated that this appeared to be rushed to press.Anyone with an idea or concept that is in a position to get VC funding or attention will already know most of what is in this book.Harmon's expertise lies in his analysis of individual stocks, not in providing an ""inside look"" at how to get VC funding. It appears as though it is more a venue for him to drop names, something he has been doing alot of lately.Check it out of the library."
1,Filler -- and not even much of that,"What a disappointment. First, giving John Doerr co-author status (as it appears here at least) is really misleading. Doerr just wrote a two-page introduction, and says nothing there he hasn't said a million times before.But even worse is how lazy and thin the whole thing is. Take away the pages of print-outs of VC address and companies stats (all available on the web for free, BTW) and the softball Q&A sessions cut-and-pasted from Harmon's email and you've got what amounts to a magazine article. And not even a particularily good one at that -- you can get better insights reading the Red Herring for a few issues, or even Business 2.0.The whole thing feels like it was thrown together over a long weekend. Anybody who has a chance with any of the VCs Harmon recommends already knows everything in this book. Don't waste your money."
5,One of a kind book on start-up to IPO to mature company!,"Finally someone has stopped dancing around what people really want to know about starting a business, obtaining financing and going public. Contacts abound in this exciting narrative of the ins-and-outs of the high tech and internet industry. I have been a long-time fan of Steve's analysis at isdex.com and now at e-harmon.com. This guy has been an out of the box thinker since he came onto the scene many years ago and has carved out an impressive niche in what will turn out to be the most influential, world changing industry called the internet. This book should be anyone's first read when considering a start-up company or for someone that wants to get an insiders view of the high flying tech world with all its glitz and glory. This stuff is more exciting than hollywood. I couldn't put it down!"
5,Thank you Steve!,"My company was approached by an ""Angel"". I didn't know what that was. I am a filmmaker not an investor! Well I read this book and now I not only know what a Angel is but I knew what I was getting into when the deal was SIGNED.If it wasn't for this book I would have walked into the meeting of my life with a blindfold. But instead I knew what to ask, and what they where asking.If you want to get on the web with your idea you NEED this book. Take it from me, you will not be sorry."
2,yet another bubble is bursting book,"Given Harmon's background as an internet economy pundit, I expected a lot more from this book. I've ridden this roller coaster all the way to the top and all the way to the bottom so i was fully expecting to really relate to what was going on in the book. I fell asleep about halfway through and never picked it up again. The Internet Bubble was THE book on this topic in my opinion."
1,Waste of money; serious fund seekers go elsewhere,"I wanted to get details on term sheets, negotiating tactics, worksheets for calculating valuation, glossary of terms. Instead, this is not even go enough for VC 101. Don't bother; it's a bad compilation of common knowledge and bad interviews."
4,Why not read it!,This book is a quick and dirty enjoyable and informative readfor those completely in the dark about the venture experience. Itprovides a good fly bye feel of what the venture experience feels likeand what people might be looking for. The book is so readable it can be read in half a day. So Why not read it! The only objection I have heard to reading it is by people who receive most of the information from Steve's newsletter... END
2,brand building -,a shameless brand building vehicle - the topic coincides a little too closely with the eHarmon.com mission statement.
5,How Narcotics Detectives broke up a Mafia Drug Ring,"Robin Moore writes a stunning novel that illustrates the fundementals of good detective work. Egan and Grosso are two Narcotics Detectives who track a mafia drug dealer, but they don't know that the mob is also part of a bigger drug ring with french dealers, who smuggle drugs over from France under the innocant cover of a famous French T.V. star. The Final bust is brilliant. A rcommended read for anyone who likes a classic novel of good detective work."
4,Handy little item,I think I would rather have gotten this in black: I think most of my jewelry would stand out more against it. Other than that I really like it a lot. I feel organized and I notice I'm wearing my jewelry more often because of it; isn't that the point?
5,Pocket jewelry organizer,I like that this organizer can be hanged anywhere and that you can hang your jewelry on both sides. Any size of jewelry can fit in at least three of its pockets.
5,Incredibly Useful!!!,"I bought a 2nd because the 1st is such a blessing! Had numerous gift requests from the girls in my family after they see mine. Not great for travel, but EXCELLENT for home use!!!"
4,good,Its very neat! Not as big as I expected it to be. I wish I could fit all my Plumeria accessories.
2,Travel kit,It is just for jewelry. Too small for other toiletry items. I would hesitate to use it for jewlery items though because it has no zippers across the rows of pockets.
5,Excellent,"This product is great. It is exactly what I thought it would be, just what I was looking for."
5,Fluid Rustle - One Of My Favorites,"My tastes run widly through most genres of music though they merge quite handily in one album - Fluid Rustle. This album is a tasty stew of jazz, classical, a little fusion, some new age, some upbeat, and some experimental. If you have been disappointed with new age (too boring), found Kronos Quartet a bit too edgy, like your music to give you new ideas, and want a multi-purpose album for personal listening in all sorts of situations (driving, hiking, chilling), this is it. Don't plan on putting it on as background music during a gathering because it will become the topic of conversation."
5,"A wonderful, culturally-rich biography from the Old West","I really enjoyed reading James Wells of Montana, an excellent, first-hand look at early American history. This true tale also provides many interesting facts of the native-American Gros Ventre culture -- very educational and my favorite aspect of the book. As you read, you become enveloped in the life of James Wells, and feel his and his family's struggles and joys. There are even some humorous anecdotes that round out the story. If you like learning about other cultures, history, or the Old West, or just enjoy accounts on the life of a family, then this book is for you."
4,The devil's in the detail,"I am Balinese and live in Ubud in the cultural center of Bali.In the Eighties I used to see Fred Eiseman, with a notebook and pen in his hand, at temple ceremonies all over the island, and in my restaurant, taking voluminous notes. I often wondered what he was up to.Now I know. He has produced the most detailed descriptions yet of most aspects of Balinese life and culture. He lives down in Jimbaran on the south coast, so many of his descriptions relate particularly to that area - practices change a bit in different places.He understands the Balinese language, which is not the case with many academics, who visit Bali briefly and write learned treatises, and don't always get it right.Fred's book is extremely well researched, and my only criticism is the detail (in places) and the repetition. That is because the book is a collection of essays. It does mean, however, that you can dip in and out of any chapter. They are self-contained, and that is useful."
5,Users of wavelets.,"The users of wavelets include engineers who design filters. The wavelet lifting technique is a powerful tool, and extraordinarily practical. The authors present it very nicely, and the book is an attractive source where anyone can pick up the essentials."
2,waste of money!!,"I learned absolutely nothing from this book. Don't believe the claims or the hype. If you really want to read it, borrow it from your local library. Don't throw your money. Just a thought."
2,Don't waste your time. Spend you cash wisely elsewhere.,"The book feels as if it was written by someone out of touch. Most of the book is vague, bland, generalized statements. Someone should do a word count on how many times Woodbury uses the word ""imagination."" A good tip off that the book is not very good is the fact that there are no peer reviews on the back cover, or front pages. There are some decent quotes from highly successful screenplay writers. But, too few. A better reco for a book like that would be 101 Habits of Highly Successful Screenwriters. I've read a lot of books in this category, and I am noticing a trend. The good ones are written by people active in the industry. Not the professors from NYC or Emerson."
5,WOW!,"The stunning examples of Nordic minimalism on this disc were a revelation to me! Beautifully performed, too! I must investigate this composer further."
5,Bratz Babyz Hair Flair!,"These dolls actually have real hair unlike the previous versions. Last year's Babyz were very cute, but I like the real hair concept a bit more than the painted on version. I am not however saying not to buy the originals either, seeing as though they have the advantage of having a blanket, furry toy and diaper bag whereas these only come with a couple plastic hair accessories. Both of the different types of Babyz are able to fit the fashion packs (sold seperately) that are available. It really comes down to which you prefer, I guess. I have also heard about there bieng more Hair Flair Bratz coming out a bit later such as Sasha & Jade which I am keeping watch for. Happy shopping and hope I could be of help!~Brittany~ -_-#1 Bratz Fan & Collector1"
3,"Sorry ""A Music Fan""","This CD is pretty good, but that's not what I really wanted to talk about. I hate to dissapoint you ""A Music Fan,"" but the kid is right: P.O.D. do cuss, and I know that it isn't printed but trust me, they do. They have admitted to it in several interviews that I have watched, although they said that they didn't put it into the lyrics list because it wasn't actually part of the lyrics, just a quick background phrase. There are other bands that do this too (omit lyrics because they aren't the main focus of that portion of the song). I won't disagree with you on the Christian focus (because they are a Christian group), but I don't think that swearing should scare off Christian fans of POD. You have to be looking hard for the words to hear them, and it doesn't stand out. They are a good band, so don't let a little background swearing throw you off...it's not the end of the world."
2,Not very good...,"I would give them a 1 star, but I'm giving them a break because it's a debut. I first heard of them with FEOS. It was a good album, but not their best. Anyway, I'd suggest spending your money on Brown, their best album. I respect them for their Christian morals, but this was a weak effort, even for a debut."
5,A most impressive effort.,"For a deput album, this CD has the power and feeling of a band far more mature than they are. The lyrics are positive and heartfelt, and the music is jamming and emotive. This album is a definate gem in any collection."
1,dumb cd,"hi. pod rocks. but the cd is very wierd. i like the band, but the cd gives me hemrpids. if you want to survive, go buy this cd."
2,The truth...,"Just a correction to the correction. They do use foul words... ""Of course we got the same view on life as most people out there - it's too short and most of the time it's quite a shi**y business."" (Circus, July 2002, p.22)Other instances of P.O.D.s profanity; ""f---ing"" (Guitar World, Nov. 2001, p. 54); ""D--n it!"" (Drum!, Sept.-Oct. 2001, p. 86); ""p--s us off"" (Drum!, Sept.-Oct. 2001, p. 87) ""d--n "" (Revolver, Nov/Dec 2001, p.63) ""p--sed off"" (AP, Nov. 2001, p. 59) ""half a-sed"" (Circus, July 2002 p. 22). And there are others.This album is ok. Southtown was a bit better. If you like metal there's definitely better albums out there. Imo, this isn't really worth the money. And I don't care about the profanity."
4,This album is Great!,"This album is different from the others, and sounds more like Rage Against the Machine (it was originally recorded in 1992). I personally love this album because it is more funky than the others (Tra gets really slap happy on his bass). I have the original release of this album, which has a more raw sound and a different album cover. I see lots of people writing reviews about how awsome this album cover is...well you should see the original!!! It's very similar, but instead of the angel holding a clinched fist...he's holding a gun to the devils head! Very controversial. And the bonus track on this CD is a just a regular track on the original album called ""Abortion is Murder""; again...very controversial....hence the change of the cover's art and the omission of the song title. I personally like this one better than ""Brown"" and the others....the new ones are just too polished. I like the older more raw sounding recordings. Hope this review helps a little..."
4,Back to the Roots,"Sometimes, every once in a while, I will hear a Warrior say that this is there best album. I think the only thing that supports that is the fact that it is so groundbreaking for the time that this was originally released. best track are the title track, ""run"", ""draw the line"" and ""every knee"". This album does have the strongest message though. It is good if you want to mosh will praising God, but it is a mainly a treat for hardcore fans. POD RIDE ON!!"
5,They ARE a Christian band,"This is the best recording that P.O.D. has out in the market to date. I'm not saying that Satellite and T.F.E.O.S aren't great albums, because they are, but keep in mind, the guys (Sonny and the rest of em') are Christian. You cannot say that they are too Christian on this album, because that's what they are, a Christian band. Aside from that, this album has deeper and smooth bass riffs, edgeier (is that a word?) and definately harder guitar riffs, and the best lyrics they have on any album. Even though you may not agree with the lyrics or believe what they talk about thats the truth. Oh yeah, Sonny has much better vocals on this album then any latter albums. He has a phatter flowing voice and can scream to the top of his lungs with the greatest of ease. GREAT ALBUM!! I guarantee you if you pick this album up, you won't be dissapointed (unless your totally ignorant of the message it is trying to portray) KEEP ROCKING FOR CHRIST YOUR GUYS!!!"
3,LOUD!,"Bought this because we needed a continuous flow compressor, and the MFG said this was the quietest one they had and would provide the continuous compressed air flow we needed.I does provide the airflow, and so far works without any problems.Of course, it is so loud that working in the same room is not possible."
2,kinda load - Thomas has good tech support,"Received as expected, actually a day early thanks Amazon, the compressor is very well packed for shipping.Upon set-up and adding a regulator, all seems fine -but it is much much louder then expected, it seems to have blown the pressure switch after 4.5 hours, it will not hold air.I'm now trying to get a reply from Thomas on where to take it or send it back for repair,I would like to resolve this as the compresser is a great size for one gun use...Thomas Tech did return my call - worked with me on phone to try & fix problem, he overnighted the replacement part and upon installation everything is up & running - good tec support, this has caused it to quiet a little"
1,cheap ripoff,"I wish I had read these reviews before I recently got chumped. I too was expecting to add to my collection of ""real"" Ginsu knives. They may be inexpensive, but they're great. Stay away from Ginsu 2000 bigtime. By the time I would pay to ship them back, it wouldn't be worth it."
1,total garbage,this product doesnt deserve 1 star. is there any way to go into the negatives? -5 stars for this piece of crap.
3,As Seen on TV products,I ordered the Ginsu knives and they weren't what I expected but the company made it their business to contact me in order to make sure I was satisified. I was issued a full refund and they were very caring and understanding with no hidden strings. I would definitely shop with them a lot in the future just because they are honest and will work with you to guarantee satisfaction!!!
5,This is a fantastic hands-on book!,"Old-fashioned Pooh is attached to a ribbon. You work through the book with your toddler (or without!), putting on Pooh's vest, slipping him into bed, pulling him out of Rabbit's doorway, etc. It's absolutely darling!"
5,ADORABLE!!!,"This book is sooooo precious!! There is a little Pooh bear you can put in his bed, his vest, get him stuck in Rabbit's hole. My daughter loves this book more and more as time moves on ( she's 18 months and we got it as a gift when she was a newborn) and we put Pooh in the book's little bed each night and she says ""Ni Ni Pooh"" About the book being ""stinky"" like cheap perfume, LOL, this is TRUE!!! I thought the friend who gave it to me sprayed it to make it smell that way, so now I know it wasn't her!!! However, after washing it twice it no longer smelled. That's another great feature, you can wash this book ( zip it closed with Pooh inside first)"
1,Stinky Pooh,"This soft, cleverly designed book is an entertaining and safe book for little ones who still like to chew while they read. However, the book smells like its been dipped in a vat of cheap purfune. I tried airing it out and washing it, but the book smelled worse, giving off a pungent, chemical odor. After handling the book, I felt nauseous! Unfortunately, this great book was ruined by poor packaging and/or carelessness on the part of the manufacturer. Do not buy this book!"
1,I bit - they bite,"I succumbed to the temptation yet again - save 15 bucks, get the knock off, it's all made in the same factory in China, I told myself. These Norelco replacement blades were half the price of ""official"" blades, so I bit. And found out they bite. They looked the same, they fit. I put them in, turned on the razor, and within 5 seconds they started rattling, a blade snared the guard and bent it. I tried shaving anyway, and it felt like a lawnmower, and left my beard as long as my lawn. I ended up throwing them away and buying a whole new Norelco razor!"
2,not great quality; bubbles easily,"i've had these on my wall for about a week and a half, and the big problem with them is the entire back isn't sticky. it's just two strips of sticky material in the center, so the corners curl u and the middle bubbles open. it's good quality paper but i'm probably going to have to buy a bunch of sticky tack to make sure it all stays on my wall. pretty disappointing; they need to make these where the entire back is post-it so that they stick better."
5,I was worried these would not be quality-GREAT product!!,"I was worried that pic printing on these would be somewhat diminished...no problems in that dept, very pleased, use them all the time, will buy again!!! Thanks!!!"
4,Lucid translation and commentary.,"A lucid translation with very helpful commentary throughout. A physically well produced book. Helpful glossary. But with Plato, one always wishes for more."
3,Haynes A/C Manual,"This book gives a very good overview of the operation and repair of an air conditioning system which I found informative and intriguing. Having said that however, I would have liked to see more detail into actually ""charging"" the A/C system with freon, effects of over-charging, etc. For the price the book provides a lot of informatoin, however, the information is very dated and not all of it is directly applicable to current day A/C systems. This book was obviously written during the time when R12 freon was the norm and paragraphs have been added over time as an update to the book in an attemp to keep it relevant for R134 A/C systems."
1,Disappointed and Depressed,I bought this Haynes book thinking that it would give me the specific information I need to upgrade my cars to R-134a. I picked it because of the 2000 publication date. BUT it is clear that they took an old book and just added some new car models to the tables in the back and reissued it. The coverage of R-134a is totally inadequate. The varous pressure/temperature tables are unlabeled but presumably apply only to R-12. The instructions for charging are aimed at R-12 and only use the bulk containers. Charging with R-134a (which is legal) is addressed by telling you to drive to a commercial shop and paying them to do it. There is no info on charging from small cans. There is no comparison of liquid and vapor charging. Very disappointing. P.S. I love the Haynes manual for my Jaguar XJ6 so don't let me scare you off Haynes.
4,Very usefull,"I'm just getting started learning auto ac after the ac quit in my pickup. The book really helped me out learning the air conditioning as it explained the basics of how ac systems work. Book also explains how to troubleshoot & service systems in pretty good detail,with clear pictures & diagrams. Only drawback I can find is that the book is getting a little dated now."
3,incomplete but ok,"This manual goes into more details about automotive ac repair, but it was missing the main information I bought it for. The exact quantity of oil required during new compressor installation.I went to my local Cadddy-Buick dealership and asked the service department. Even they were unsure. The manager asked one of his ""certified"" technicians and even this info wasn't clear.It's no wonder this manual does not have the info."
2,Same old song and dance.....................,"I picked up this book at a yard sale for fifty cents, and that is about what it was worth. I read NOTHING NEW here that wasn't good old common sense. It seems to me that Ms.Snow is going down Sylvia Browns road and recycling other peoples work."
1,Wait Until I Set Out My Trash,"Psychic Gifts by Tiffany Snow is no more than the eccentric ramblings of an ""OBSCURE"" author. This is the worst NDE book I have EVER read. This ""Doctor"" makes little to no mention of heaven, what's going on there, and so on. What she does do in this book is attempt to boost her own over inflated ego. An example of that is when I was shopping NDE books on Amazon I purchased this one based on all of the good reviews. Big mistake! Now I have noticed that MOST of the reviews have been posted on the same day (many in one day). Obviously this lady or her family is ""Tooting"" her own horn. The only gift this lady has is of a somewhat vivid imagination concerning herself. If you feel you must read it, get it a library. Well, on second hand she is an ""Obscure"" author, even though she is a legend in her own mind. So I doubt a library would have it. Maybe you could pick it up at half.com for a buck or two, or wait until I set my trash out."
1,"confusion, confusion, confusion","I bought this book as a recommendation when I purchased another item. The positive reviews are all from people who work for this outfit. Prayer classes, teleconferences, animal healing, hmmm, doesn't this sound like tbn or the bakkers? How quickly we forget? We should be responsible for our own lives instead of giving our power away to such confused folks.Meditate and save your money!"
5,Hey - there's an EXORCISM chapter in here!,"Hey - has anyone noticed there is a whole piece on exorcism in here? Its in the same chapter as the heirachy of angels, spirits, and what ghosts and energy tracings are. What a hoot. Ok, I did the ""self-Deliverance"" thing/prayer and actually coughed up something. True to God, I felt better afterward, and I haven't had the nightmares since. No matter what you believe, pick up the book just for that and get rid of the hair-ball, or demon, or whatever. God, the PAIN in my back WENT AWAY too. Two years from a car wreck, acupunture every week, didn't help much. What can I say?"
5,Tools to Connect with Spirit and Self,"This is a wake up call, for those who are still sleeping. This is a good book that can help stir you up to walk with God and expecting signs and miracles. Helping you move from your comfort zone and into the deeper things of God."
5,Try before you buy,"I have not bought this Gateway series, yet but certainly intend to. What I want to say is that for people who are not experienced meditators or even who do meditate and want to try this out first, go to the Monroe Institute website and you can download a free 30 minute Introduction to the Gateway Experience. I tried this (never having meditated before) and it worked amazingly well. I actually thought to myself that I could hear my body breathing and my body felt like it was asleep, but that my mind was perfectly awake and alert. I later found that one aim of the first CD was to achieve ""mind awake, body asleep."" So all I know is that it definitely works, even for a complete amateur."
4,Great Gateway!,"The Robert Monroe's,Gateway Experience, was mentioned in a a book called Frequency. The idea of sound changing our brain is suprising and interesting so I had to try it. I have not enjoyed all 18 of the discs yet but I am working my way through slowly. It is not quite what I imagined. The discs have a lot of imagery and the sound is not as impactful as I thought it would need to be but the gentle pulsating sounds have put me in a peaceful sleep several times and I have generally been pleased with the program."
3,Overpriced and Underdocumented,"It was very difficult choosing the number of stars to give the CD set. On one hand the technology is excellent, but it comes with only a brief pamphlet for instructions that I did not find very helpful. I have not read the Monroe books but it seems unlikely they would be of much use either. The full course I sure would help but I'm not about to spend that kind of money just for instructions. I could not tell any difference between Local 1 and Local 2, or focus 12 and focus 21, so I just may be a hopeless Hemi-Sync philistine. On the plus side the sound used is a white noise that is soothing and the narrative voice is well done. On the negative the $499 list price is way above what it is worth. Unless you can find it for a fraction of that, give this one a pass. There are much better buys out there."
3,Did not like it as much as others by Saramago,"I Love reading Saramago. This is my 5th book by him and probably the one that I have liked the least. The first half was very interesting, I would venture to say that if it had continued like that, this would be my favorite book by Saramago. Unfortunately the second part was not as solid and it was rather weak and not interesting.Overall I still liked it, but it could have been better."
5,Las Intermitencias...,Fue la primera novela que leí de José Saramago. Al principio fue un poco difícil de leer por su estilo particular de escribir. Cuando lo entendí quedé fascinado por todo y con cada palabra. La historia... Un mal necesario...
2,Hume is turning in his grave,"David Hume is easily my favorite philosopher, so when I read of a ""humean"" modern moral philosopher, I jumped on this book. Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed. When I read Brandt's belief that everyone in society should receive the same income, I could read no more. Hume would have been horrified by such an idea. Hume's moral theory was based on benevolence, but it was based on utility as well. Hume would have had some clue as to the complete disaster to the economy, and the incredible amount of power this would have placed in the federal government's hands. It never ceases to amaze me how naive modern philosophers can be when it comes to basic political economy."
2,disapointed,"I do not see how this DVD set was rated so high by its viewers. Maybe it is just to much for beginers? (it does say for beginers and intermediates after all)first I should have been more careful with only two real instructors from Israel...thats the first red flag.If this set did not have them it would be pure garbage.Disk 4 seems to be the only ""good"" one, with 3 being OK.Most of the videos are filmed in a darkened area, which sucks. The main ""host"" Duncan Pattle makes this set hard to watch. He makes little sound effects with his mouth with every punch or kick...after a few doven it gets old, and there must be hundreds of them!I feel some of the material is just watered down by poor instructors like Pattle. Amnon Darsa and Eyal Yanilov are the only ones on the set worth watching.If you are looking for simple yet hard core combatives, pass on this set. Go with something from Kelly McCann/Jim Grover."
4,Close but...,Ordered this for my husband. He said it wasn't exactly what he expected but was happy enough to keep it.
5,Krav boxed set,Extremely well videoed. I've been studying Krav Maga for the last nearly one year and this is a great adjunct to my training.
5,Simply and clear,I practice KM and these DVD give the oppotunity to review all tecniques at home and fix them in mind. Really usefull. Well done!
5,"A book written about the Quaker life, and much more","The book was enlightening and a very good read. In fact, the book was so well written, it was difficult to put down, once opened. The words of wisdom that are offered, are simply things have become common sense in today's society, but are sometimes forgotten or taken from granted. To read this book is a good reminder of what's important around us, and inside of us. And with all these wonderful things, a story of one man's life as a Quaker, is intertwined. A rich story, at that."
4,Wisdom for all,This is a clearly written book about the basic tenets of the friends. It offers wisdom for all.
2,"'Wise,' but debatably 'Quaker'","Appreciate the stories told by this author about his life and consider the insights that he has gained from reflection on his experience; but, please, do not base your understanding of Quakerism on his presentation. In spite of the fact that Smith is a lifelong Friend and a former Quaker educator, he quotes George Fox (an important leader in the early Quaker movement) and the Bible inaccurately or out of context several times. In addition, some of Smith's statements about facets of Quaker faith and practice are historically unfounded or ignore the diversity within the Religious Society of Friends today. If you are interested in learning about Quakerism, read Wilmer A. Cooper's book, A Living Faith: An Historical Study of Quaker Beliefs (Friends United Press: 1990). Read Robert Lawrence Smith's book as a book of wisdom written by a Quaker, but not necessarily a Quaker book of wisdom."
3,"Good, general information","As the author states, this is a book written by an older man for his grandchildren and others their age. It is a good general book with stories about how to live out various aspects of Quaker tradition. It is not a reference book nor does it offer a great deal of historical information. I found it a bit ""light"" for a mature reader, although it does not talk down to younger people. I passed it on to someone younger and it was just what they were looking for. I don't wish to give the impression that it was a bad book. It was just more of an appetizer when I was looking for dinner."
5,Great!,I bought this for my husband for a surprise for his 30th birthday! He loved it and the fit was great!
4,Bring back old times,She was the star that inspired me through the arts. Her interpretations bring me back to those times when music had drama inside the words.
2,An exercise in self aggrandizement,"The story of the US Military Liaison Mission in East Germany is a story that needed telling -- and it still does. Fahey's book is more about his personal travails such as receiving a traffic ticket and wearing a required patch than it is about Mission operations. While Fahey is undoubtedly an excellent Russian linguist, he couldn't be much of an intelligence officer if, as he says, he was detained by the Soviets seven times out of six attempts. He constantly boasts of his photographic memory, but misspells at least two names. He seems intent on degrading other members of the Mission and delights in demonstrating what he perceives to be his intellectual superiority."
2,Bland revue,"Get Used To It, the 1992 revue written by Tom Wilson Weinberg(Ten Percent Revue) is undeniably well-sung especially in ""Hymn"", ""Friends In High Places"" performed by Jamie MacKenzie and ""How We Get The News"" performed by MacKenzie, Brad Whitaker, Wayne Barker and George Howe. The trouble I have with this show is the lack of variation; so much of it sounds the same! There is a strong gay message which is unfortunately saddled by bland melodies. Sorry, just my opinion."
1,Did not get what I expected,"Ordered a NEW cash drawer. The one I received was banged up, and had a difficult time getting key in and out of the lock. Definitely not in new condition."
4,"Compelling, Truthful account of a power hungry boy","This true-crime book is about 18 year-old Darren Huenemann, and his struggles to come to grips with reality. It explains his diabolical scheme to off his mother and his wealthy grandmother to get his inheritance early. It gives insight into Darren's thought pattern and his deepening interest in Albert Camus's brilliant play Caligula, and how he tries to emulate the tyrannical Roman Emperor in his day to day life. Darren's irresistable and manipulative personality lures in two outcasts, Derik Lord and David Muir, who Darren manipulates to commit the grizzly murders. The book gives extensive information on the backgrounds of Doris Leatherbarrow and Sharon Huenemann, the two victims. Overall ""Such a Good Boy"" is a thrilling and flawlessly written book and I highly recommend it and its movie counterpart, Scorn."
2,Hate it when the movie turns out to be better than the book,"I am totally disappointed in this book. It's really bad when the movie seems to give you more insight than the book on the same subject. Like so many ""true crime"" books, it does nothing but depend a lot on court transcripts and second-hand interviews. The author did not try. The author did not dig. The author did not seem that interested in his subject."
1,lies and half truths,"This book was written without true knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding the case. It contains suppositions, half truths, misconceptions, and outright lies. The author would not look into other facts we gave her. She relied on interviews of people who had nothing to do with the investigation, but ignored those who were. The movie, Scorn, is even farther from the truth. It does not even come close to portraying an accurate idea of the events. Not even close! What a waste of money!"
4,Richard Wright - Life and Times,"Although a used copy (from a library) the book was in excellent condition.I have read Richard Wright's ""Native Son"" and wanted to find out more about the author. I enjoy Hazel Rowley's style of biography writing that I also bought her other books on Christina Stead and Satre - Bouvoir. Those of you who enjoy reading biographies, cannot go wrong with this one. Amazon is one amazing company - I'm never disappointed.Happy reading .. Anita Grinberg\"
2,"Stick with ""Why We Buy""","I loved ""Why We Buy"" and bought it for several friends. I've probably loaned it out more than any other book I own. I had high hopes for this and was underwhelmed. Whereas I cannot stop applying the lessons from WWB each time I go shopping, there aren't very many insights in COTM that make me observe malls and shopping experiences. I love this stuff and wanted more than to eavesdrop as Underhill accompanies folks on trips to the mall."
2,A disappointing second book,"I very much enjoyed Paco Underhill's first book about shopping, _Why_We_Buy_. Therefore, I was looking forward to this new effort with a great deal of anticipation, most of which was disappointed. Somewhere in this book is approximately one essay worth of interesting material; unfortunately, it's smeared all over a longer book that doesn't really stand up to the material.I really wanted to like this book, but I did not. If you haven't read the first book, skip this one, and read that one. it was a great book. This was a waste of my time."
3,Everything you've always wanted to know about malls!,"Paco Underhill takes an entertaining and interesting look about a place we all go to- the mall. In each chapter, a different part of the mall is taken on, from the décor to the food to the bathrooms! I loved how he also looked at malls in other countries in comparison to the American mall. Not only did I feel like I learned a lot, but I never felt like Underhill was talking down to me, which I find extremely irritating in a book. I think I will pick up his book before this, ""Why We Buy""."
3,the play-by-play of a trip to the mall. ooooooh.,"First off, I thought ""Why We Buy"" was a great book. It was fun, entertaining and tremendously educational. The sequel just doesn't live up to the same standards. It's a a play-by-play of a trapse through the mall. Sure, you pick up some interesting tidbits here and there, but I thought the most engaging parts were when he restated parts from the previous book. It's a quick and easy read, you pick up a few things here and there, but I wouldn't say it's a ""must read"" by any means. Wait for the paperback or borrow it from the library. It's not one you need to keep on your shelves."
3,Now I know why I (don't) shop at the mall,"This book, while a very easy and enjoyable read, was not up to the quality of the last book Why We Buy. It was interesting none the less. As with Why We Buy every now and then you get the feeling that he is advertising his business."
4,"Why You Should Buy ""Call of the Mall""","I recommend ""Call of the Mall: The Geography of Shopping by the Author of Why We Buy"" by Paco Underhill to anyone who is interested in marketing, retail, merchandising, or shopping, in general. If you liked ""Why We Buy,"" you will want to read this book. Paco Underhill is one of my favorite authors. His books are filled with useful information and insights."
5,Very informative and Interesting,"Having previously read Paco Underhill's ""Why we buy"" I was anxious to read ""Call of the mall"". Americans spend alot of time and money in shopping malls. Underhill knows why this is and how retailers can increase both of these things.Call of the mall takes you on a journey through an ordinary mall in New Jersey. The book covers everything about a mall that a consumer is influenced by. He starts in the parking lot and ends with high end department stores.The part I enjoyed the most of the section on malls outside of the United States, especially those in Japan. He placed this section in the book perfectly and it is by far the most interesting part.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in retail marketing and consumer behavior."
2,very dry reading. nothing to learn,i expected a lot more from this writer. its just a rambling of a day in the mall. nothing much new to learn for marketers.
3,It's Alright,"I had to read this book for a consumer-behavior class. The subject matter is so interesting and full of unique little insights about our consumer culture, but Underhill gives only a cursory analysis; in reality, most of the book seems to be a mechanism for name-dropping clients and touting the glorious magic that is...Paco Underhill.Underhill's writing style is flippant and annoying, but having said that, it is a quick and easy read and a good intro to anyone interested in the topic."
3,Somewhat engaging but not very informative,"""The Call of the Mall"" is a book that is sure to please the ""minority"" of Americans who do not favor the big box/stripmall/fashion mall culture of mainstream America. I am among that growing group of people seeking more sustainable, more humane geographical models of existing and getting along with one another. As an introduction to this notion, ""Call of the Mall"" is indeed ""engaging"" as another reviewed described it. However, it does not really address the underlying WHYS of the physical structure of modern America, nor does it propose realistic solutions."
3,"an average sequel, at best","Underhill's first book ""Why We Buy"" was very good, a smart analysis of the shopping mind and how stores react to it. Call of the Mall, however, sounded more like a bunch of stuff he thought of later--stuff that would've made the first book better, but not enough to write a second. This was more like a step by step breakdown of what designers should notice. Interesting, yes, but a bit long-winded for a casual reader. That makes the style a bit ironic, for it is almost too casual, like he wrote it by walking around speaking into a tape recorder. He's interesting, but this is the kind of book you use to kill time in the doctor's office. If you haven't read the first, ""Why We Buy"" is the better choice."
2,"Disappointing followup to ""Why We Buy""","Underhill's Why We Buy was required reading for my marketing class, and after opening it up, I was hooked by his research and insight into buying behaviors. By contrast, I struggled through 70 pages of Call of the Mall before coming across some of the more interesting aspects of what retailers could do differently. Overall the book presents few compelling insights; it almost feels that he used up all his juicy bits for the first book and really had to dig at the bottom of the barrel for this one.Final word: Don't bother..."
1,Light and shallow,"Underhill has done it again, but what has he done. This is a light read that feels a little too much like being dragged through the mall with a witty uncle. I find his cute asides mildly entertaining, but there is really no meat to his observations. He makes shallow complaints about bad design of malls or stores, but then I kept wondering what malls he visited. Obviously, he's missed the giant ones in Dallas or Atlanta or DC or San Diego which look and feel very different from what he has described. Finally, this book may appeal to retailers, but perhaps that suggests the sorry state of retailing. I mean aren't most people spending their money in either the Targets, Costcos, or Walmarts."
3,Follow up to Why we buy,"Paco Underhill does it again. He has a way of making you look at how you buy and where you buy in a whole new way. If you are in any form of business that sells anything or that advertises anything you must read this book andWhy We Buy.This book, although a little ""Self Promoting"" takes the reader through a tour of a mall and points out different things that should interest anyone who is in a retail business. There is a great deal of repeat information from the book Why We Buy and that is a little annoying. Otherwise it is an interesting book."
3,Wish he'd gone deeper,"While I liked this book, I thought that Underhill could have done a much better job in explaining WHY WE BUY. I think I walked away from the book with a very superficial idea of what he was trying to explain.This book was far more essay and less fact. My guess is that it was probably written that way to appeal to a greater audience. For all of Underhill's background and experience, I wish he had given us more. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs when he gave us his literary menader through the mall."
4,Excellent beginning,"While, I do not believe that Chris has fully been able to recapture the magic of his Storyhill days (his former band). You can definitely see pieces of what made his former partnership so great. The eclectic musical style, the touching, personal lyrics. His voice is not polished, but carries emotion. You can tell that he feels the lyrics that he sings. I truly hope that Chris continues to make music and entertain. I highly recommend this album"
3,full circle,"it was good folks music, but i thought the music i purchase was from the group 6th sense that has the album ( sleepless )"
5,Works exactly as advertised.,"This cradle works exactly as advertised. It fits well into the cradle, hotsyncs with a push of the button on the front just as it should.As for charging, it says all over the box that it will charge your Treo 600 if you plug the phones AC charger (not included) into the connector on the cradle cable. In other words, it doesn't come with the AC adapter, you must take the one that came with your phone and connect it to the cradle cable. That being said, it charges my phone perfectly and hotsyncs like a champ.I also bought it so that while it's charging at my desk, I can still see/read the screen since it holds the phone upright instead of laying on the desk. This also makes using the phone's speakerphone a pleasure as it charges and holds the phone in a good position at the same time."
1,Dont buy this,"Its amazing how crappy this piece of equipment is. The HotSync function works intermittently, charge function never worked for me.The cable that comes with a travel charger does both without fail everytime."
4,"Excellent function and quality, price a little high","I bought this becasue my Ford constantly pops it's Check Engine light. Considering the visit to the dealer is around 3/4 of a bill each time, I figured this would equal two trips to the dealer.It does a nice job of reading the codes and resetting. It also does a nice job of monitoring the sensors. What it will not tell you is exactly how to fix your problem in many cases. I am an ex-service manager (from the pre-techno era) and reasonably accomplished mechanic. Even I have to do research after collecting the code. Determine WHY you have a particular sensor reading. Different things can trip the same sensor.This is a well built tool to help you in your diagnosis. It is not the automatic answer machine some people may assume it to be.I think this tool should sell for under a bill. That detracts one star."
5,"Cheap,simple, works well on my Civic,nothing fancy","NO battery required. No extra plug adapters to figit with or lose, just a simple, easy to use plug and play code reader for your vehicle. Price was great and I need not look up the code description in a book or on a CD-ROM, instead I instantly know why the darn light is on again and after repair, rest th light to pass inspection. No more black sticky tape to cover the CEL Woo-hoo!What I want to know is why vehicle manufacturers do not build this simple tool into the vehicle itself, cost would be $20 or so, easily absorbed by the huge price tag paid when new. A solid light that says check engine? ""Come on...thats so 80's man...This is the new millinium!"""
5,Exactly as advertised,"I bought it because two of my cars threw codes. The BMW cost me over $100 for the dealer to read, tell me they couldn't find anything wrong, and reset; I used this scanner to verify that the other car's code wasn't significant, delete the code, and it hasn't returned for over a month. It's already saved its purchase price. Simple to use, inexpensive, and does the job."
3,Nice basic scanner,"Bought this for my gf's car. Dash randomly lights up like a xmas tree. Scanner produced no codes which sort of confirms my suspicion of an electrical short somewhere. Tool is very basic and construction is somewhat suspect (I would be careful to not drop on anything hard). Received product rather quickly. Unlike many of the other ""poor"" reviews, if you know what this tool is for and can research and fix your own automotive issues, this product is satisfactory."
3,"Nice tool for the money, useless manual","The manual is confusing and poorly printed. But, like computer modems, manuals for scan tools can be sort of generic, at least so far as the devices have similar innards. The ""Digital OBDII Code Reader Manual"" on the website of the Open Source Software House is 102 pages (about half being code definitions) and looks to be more useful, although I haven't studied it yet. Others may be even better.One of the virtues of the 9135 is that I was able to plug it in, read the codes and clear them after getting no farther than page 2 in the Actron book.It may be that the main difference between the costly readers and the less costly ones lies in the reference material provided in the package, with the consumer-grade models being the most cryptic.This tool is by no means all you need to work on late model cars, but it is certainly a necessity."
4,Works as described,Read out my OBDII error code with a one-line description and allowed me to reset it. No problem!
5,Great product,"I constantly had a chack engine light on my 2003 Dodge Ram and couldn't figure out what was wrong as the truck ran great. I plugged in the auto scanner and had 2 codes that helped me fix the problem myself without going to the dealer. It helped that I am a mechanic and know my way around cars fairly well. This unit will NOT fix your car for you. What it will do is send you in the right direction to correct the problem yourself. Goodluck, and watch out for dealerships who will go out of their way to sell you expensive services you don't need! Always get second opinions before spending alot of money!"
5,Saves money. Saves Time. No brainer.,"Two of my vehicles were throwing codes. Local retailer would pull the codes for free if I got an oil change, but never needed one when I was there. Purchased the unit online and within a few minutes of opening the box, had the codes and two days later had purchased the parts and fixed it myself. Overall probably saved myself a couple hundred dollars. Since then I've pulled codes for some coworkers who were so appreciative they paid me $10. With the money I saved originally, this seems to be putting money back in my pocket. I highly recommend this product. I only wish the packaging would have included a storage case, but I've since purchased a small plastic case at Harbor Freight to keep it in."
5,Peace of mind,I have used the scanner since I received it and I am very pleased with it.I live on the Big Island of Hawaii and it is reassuring to knew what has turned on my check engine light without paying a big bill to have it read. I find many things that turn on the light are not immediate action required items
3,Cheap way to analyze Engine Warning Lights,"I bought this because my Engine Warning light came on. I plugged it in, 20 seconds later I had ""Slow Response on Sensor, Bank I Sensor 1"". Erased it. Saved $40. I may end up having to replace a sensor sometime in the future, but knowing what the light says gives me all kinds of decision making power.I might have skipped over this for the ScanGuage though. The Scan Guage has built in statistics for analyzing Gas Mileage and such. It also costs $100 more.This is a great by at $72. Solidly built, easy to use (easier than setting the time on a vcr anyway), and easy to store. I have used it three times in the 2 months I have had it. It has already paid for itself (Shop wants $40 just to plug theirs in).Whoopeee."
4,"""know before you go""","This tool is a must have, that is if you dont want to get taken to the cleaners by your auto repair facility ,be it the local garage or worse yet , the dealership! Knowing whats wrong before you leave your car with the mechanic will not only alleviate fear of the unknown but also show you how honest your mechanic is. He does'nt know that you already know what the problem is! His diagnosis should be at the very least related to or exactly what the scanner is telling you. Iv'e read the average cost of a scan when you bring your car in is around sixty dollars, so it will pay for itself in less than three uses! Very easy to use,I would give it 5 stars but I cant use it on my 89 chevy van. Can only be used on vehicles 1995 and up that are OBD2 compliant."
3,"Useful product, but it doesn't replace the mechanic","This scanner does a decent job of reading error codes off of my car, but it doesn't always pull back all of the codes that the mechanics can see with their commercial readers. In one instance I used the scanner to diagnose a problem with my car. Since I couldn't make the repair myself I took the car to the mechanic who informed me there was one additional error code present which this reader was not picking up. Since this is a mechanic I trust I am left wondering whether this reader always picks up all the codes which the professionals see."
4,AutoScanner was a great gift for my husband,I purchased this for my husband's birthday. He was delighted with it and it helped him diagnose the problem with my son's car.
2,"Not made in the USA,","For those to whom it may be important, and it is to me: though the Amazon description says this scanner is made in the USA, and so does the description on the manufacturer's website, the scanner I received clearly says made in China on the packaging. I know I jumped at this purchase when I did partly because of the Made in the USA statement. So I'm a little disappointed. Also, the CD requires Windows and Internet Explorer to read it. No Macs need apply."
1,Why spend even $60 (if it's on sale)?,"Here's the one and only question I have for you, potential Actron Car Diagnostic Code Scanner Buyer:Do you have an AutoZone, Murray's Discount Auto, Pep Boys or other national chain automotive supply store anywhere near your house or place of work? If so, did you know that all of these fine stores offer this exact same service (scanning codes and resetting CELs) for FREE? Oh, as an added bonus, they'll give you a print-out that gives you possible causes for whatever code the device pulls as well as some solutions.Unless you live prohibitively far from a national chain auto store, there's no reason to purchase this device. It's a terrible deal. Thumbs down to this one."
1,loser,I may have bought this scanner but was mis lead. The scanner I need is the one for the the cable kit I bought.I don't have any way of contect for the phone # I have no answer has been made yet
4,User Friendly,"This code scanner is very easy to use. The instructions were short, to the point and got me up and running in 10 minutes."
2,Unreasonable repair policy,"I owned mine for 13 months (one month past warranty) when it scrambled it's messages. It probably was less than 13 months, but I procrastinated. At any rate, the repair cost quoted, with shipping, was $10 less than the original purchase price. After telephoning twice, e-mailing the same, Actron wouldn't budge. Half that might have worked for me, but not full price.In other words, it works for a year and then they want you to buy a new one. I will be looking elsewhere."
2,Works fine BUT...,"The manufacturer does not support this product. There is no info on Actron's website related to this model. The software included does not cover anything after 2002. An email sent to the address on Actron's website came back undeliverable. If I had known these facts, I would have bought a different brand. The unit does read codes, and displays a short description of the definition of the code. But since the software does not cover my 2005, I am wondering whether the codes are correct and complete for my vehicle."
4,On a budget? Try this!,"I purchased this just to figure out codes set by my wife's Buick. When it snows, it has a habit of setting a code for the traction system, even though no trouble is ever found. After a few trips to the dealership, I decided this would quickly pay for itself... it did!If you need just a basic scanner, this is it. I think the only difference to the next model up, is the next model is battery powered to keep the code onscreen when it is unplugged from the OBD connector. To save the extra money, I can easily write down the code(s), if needed, on a piece of paper (grin)."
5,Exactly what you want.,"Plug it in, turn the ignition to on, and in about 10 seconds you'll be able to see the codes.Press a couple of buttons, the check engine light goes out.Everything should work this simply. Will easily pay for itself with a couple of uses."
5,$$ SAVED Problem Solved,"Why 5 stars?It was an obscure Temp. Sensor problem, that had already cost me $275.00,-- solved by a $25.00 part change and the 'investment' in my own ""Actron"" Auto Scanner. If you are a ""shade tree mechinic"" get one of these things,. If you make a living with your tools you have to get a ""Actron"". Either way don't hold back you'll get your money's worth on the first repair."
4,Does what it needs to do...,"I bought this to decypher the jumble of codes and to make repairs to the system before going for a smog test. In the past when the ""check engine"" light was on I had to take it to a shop and the cost was always at the maximum allowed by law, like $500.00.This little tool does exactly what it is supposed to do: it retrieves the code, which you can look up on the provided software. You can then use the CP9135 to clear the code and make the repair.Worth every penny paid."
4,Works Good,"Bought this to use on an Audi A6. Have used it a couple times, works great. Would recommend for anyone who likes car gadgets. This beats having to go to the dealer or auto parts store to figure out why the pesky check engine light keeps coming on!"
2,Worked great.. then stopped working at all after a year and a half,"I purchased this as a gift two years ago for a weekend wannabe car guy in my family. Because his cars were all new, he only had a chance to use it one or twice. I ended up borrowing it a couple times, as did some others in my family. The last time I borrowed it about 6 months ago, it didn't work. Now, granted, it probably spent a year in his garage doing nothing, but shouldn't it still work? And word to the wise, 2 years ago I paid $75 for it so wait for a sale. I contacted Actron to see if they offer any sort of repair or service and I hope that they are reasonable about that.But when it did work, I really liked the item and recommended it to countless friends and family. Now that it is not functioning, I have to go to Advance Auto or AutoZone to scan, but luckily there is no short supply of them. I'm at a loss if I should replace the gift since I was the one who discovered it broken, I guess I need to find an etiquette book."
5,Diagnostic Code Scanner,Works well and easy to use. Comes with everything you need. A must have if you plan to do your own work on your car.
5,The Happy Prince by Oscar Wilde,"Truly one of the best stories ever told. A young, happy prince lives inside the castle walls, never knowing the struggles of his subjects until his death. After his death a gold statue with ruby eyes and other jewels in his sword is erected in his honor in the middle of town. The spirit of the young prince lives on in the statue and he despairs over the sadness of his people until he befriends a young swallow. He convinces the swallow to wait to fly south for the winter and to instead help him to help his subjects by taking the jewels embedded in the statue to various desperately poor people. After the jewels are all gone he instructs the swallow to strip him of his gold and distribute it among the people until there is nothing left but an ugly statue. The end brings tears to any eye. Definitely a story of love and kindness that will touch the heart of everyone both young and old."
4,Wonderful..but,"I love the way this mascara goes on and looks, but it is NOT smear, sweat or waterproof. Don't cry or you'll have raccoon eyes!"
5,Great Vegan Mascara,"The reason I bought this was because after going vegan last year I decided I needed to replace my makeup with vegan friendly products as well. This mascara looks great on and I love the little mirror on the side. My only complaint, and it is a small issue, is that it takes a little longer than some other mascaras to dry. You have to make sure you don't blink hard for a few minutes after application. However, if you do, it is really easy to remove any smudges. On that same note, this mascara washes off really easy with soap and water, and that is a big plus in my book."
2,Ugh,"I feel bad giving a hippie mascara a bad review, but this mascara makes my eyes itch, and it's runny, and smears a lot, and feels like it's never completely dry."
5,This mascara is the best,"My eyes looked so sexy with this mascara, I was pleasantly suprised that an eco-friendly product could look so good. My eyes are sensitive and I have not had any irritation with this mascara."
2,This is merely a filler pad for a compact....,"No where on the description does it explain that this is merely a pad that goes inside a compact...which is not included.I feel ripped off. I am able to return the item but despite being a Prime item, I have to pay return shipping charges."
3,Not for thickening,This mascara colors my lashes and adds a slight amount of volume. I prefer more coverage and a thicker look. I feel like I have spider lashes with this. Its perfect for someone who likes that look. It isn't for me.
4,A great daily mascara,"Ecco Bella Black Mascara is great for everyday use. I love how few ingredients this mascara has and that is the reason I purchased it. I am used to dramatic effects with using a mascara but I am willing to tone it down in the name of simplicity. My eyes didn't burn, but I did notice mascara coming off onto my glasses. So far, I like it."
5,Great neutral eyeshadow color for everyday use.,"""Heather"" is a nice neutral shade that brightens up your eyes. Cream color (just a hint of yellow; does not look yellow on skin) with no shimmer to it. Apply this color first, then accent with a darker shadow in the crease.All of the Ecco Bella FlowerColor eye shadows are fantastic. They go on smooth, last forever, no creasing. Great color selection. Dark colors work well as dry liner. Non-irritating for people with sensitive eyes, too.TIP: Two of the 1/2 pans together will fit in make-up palettes made for 1 7/16"" (36mm) size shadow pans. (CatCosmetics*, Fresh, Japonesque, Trish McEvoy, Mirenesse, FACE Stockholm and possibly MAC.)*my prefered case"
2,Disappointing,"The problem with it is that any time I try to sharpen the pencil, the whole point breaks off. Get's expensive when you lose an inch or more after trying over and over to get a point!"
5,naturally great look,"Mascera goes on smooth, not clunky, and looks great. I would make this my main mascera."
4,Good organic product,"It took me a little while to warm up to this mascara as it does not give quite the volume that I was used to with mainstream mascaras. I work twelve hour shifts and wear contacts and I have had no issues whatsoever with flaking or stinging my eyes. If I'm out in the humidity for very long, though, it does tend to smudge. It also washes off easily. Overall, a good product; the only thing it's missing is a little more volume."
5,Great mascara!,"I have bought this mascara twice now and really like it. I also like that it is more ""natural"" than other chemical laden mascaras especially since it is so close to my eyes!"
2,It's ok - as long as you don't care about volume & length,"I've been in the process of switching all skin care products to all-natural/chemical free, and wanted to try a ""eco"" mascara. It is OK - goes on easy, doesn't clump; but it doesn't really look like you are wearing mascara and adds zero volume or length. It made my eyelashes separated and more defined, but that's about it. I had to use four coats to make it even look like I was wearing mascara (I usually use one coat of a Stila mascara).So in summary - its good if you just want definition and a natural product, as long as you don't care about volume or length."
1,"Meh, may as well go without mascara","I suppose most ""natural"" mascaras won't work as well as the chemical laden stuff, but this is a real waste of $11. It smears on your eyelid as you put it on, then looks like you're wearing nothing at all."
5,Like it better than Maybelline,"I was just trying to use fewer chemical-laden products, but this stuff is great. I don't get the same black rings under my eyes at the end of the day. I should note I only apply mascara to upper lashes."
5,best mascara,"I love this mascara, it's super dark, goes on smoothly. i wear contacts and love that it doesn't flake into my eyes. It washes off cleanly too, it's great!"
2,"Good quality, wrong color!","Beware of ""cocoa""! It is really red - just what I need on my already reddish eyes. But it is well made, so I am saving it for lip liner or for Halloween.If you are looking for brown, the bronze is a light brown, and the seal is dark brown.I do think ""cocoa"" is a misleading name. Wish I had known, as it was the first I ordered."
2,I don't like it at all!,"I bought this item, which I thought was a little pricey for a pencil, because I was having allergy problems with my eye makeup. It won't go on my lids. It's also very flaky. I'm disappointed and would not recommend it to anyone. It was not worth $13.Thanks, Carol M"
3,Natural effect,"This mascara doesn't clump and has a lashtint-like effect.The mirror on the tube is convenient, and it does lengthen and thicken a bit. Overall a nice vegan mascara. I purchase this regularly. Unfortunately,after a full workday it flakes a little and stings in my eyes (I wear contacts) so I recommend removing it after 8 hours or so and applying fresh for the night."
2,Still contains yucky chemicals,"The search for a good natural mascara continues. This does have few ingredients, but includes propylparaben, which received a high (bad) rating of 5 on the environmental working group: [...], and methylparaben, which gets the same bad score: [...]."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I have used natural product based eyeliners before, but they were usually not dark enough or wore off very fast. This pencil was very surprising. It goes on very easily, is very dark and wears off about the same as the toxic big name eyeliners. I am going to buy another one for my purse and one for my travel bag. It is also extremely inexpensive compared to other natural eye liner products."
5,doesn't run!,"I haven't had this product in the summer yet, but all through my workouts and 16 hour days I never turn into a racoon. I never reapply it throughout the day unless I'm going out and want a darker look. Only flaw is that it doesn't sharpen well, so use a metal eyeliner sharpener rather than a regular pencil sharpener and there won't be a problem."
1,Not as advertised,"I read all the reviews for this item before I bought it and saw only one person who said it was not as advertised -- that it was as hard as a colored pencil. I should have listened to that one review and ignored the others. It is not soft, by any definition, and is unusable as eyeliner. Waste of money."
1,i would give no stars if possible,"this pencil is hideous. all you reviewers must have been paid to give a good review - this is NOT a soft pencil - it is hard and the color doesn't go on without a lot of pressure. i could have bought a similar item at the drugstore for about 3 bucks! it's like the colored pencils i used when i was a kid!since i tried to use it, i'm stuck with an almost $15 pencil that is not at all as described."
1,D I S A P P O I N T E D,"Sorry folks, received pencils - tested them all - didn't like em - not soft, don't go easily on, difficult to spread, hard to control - expected more. Can't be the only one - don't see a lot sold. This is the difficulity of purchasing items on line; didn't bother to return them, most people don't."
2,Not quite what I was looking for,The tracks on this CD contained multiple selections that were for male and female duet and could not be easily adapted to use for a single voice.
2,did not get the picture,what i got is a quality tool but it is not what was pictured in the listing. which really makes me mad because if i knew what i was going to get i would not have ordered it because i did not need it. i feel like i still should receive the idem that is pictured.
5,Phenomenal.,"This set, along with the Limited edition of Patlabor 2, are must-haves for animation fans. The film itself is spectacular, as good as it is it is surpassed by Patlabor 2 (in the original Japanese only. The dub is awful). This set comes with the complete Oshii Storyboards and an extremely interesting and well designed booklet about the history of Patlabor and the film. A handsome edition appropriate for any animation fan or sci-fi fan."
5,sci-fi thriller with massive robots and mad scientists,"it's actually much more sophisticated than my summary lets on. The director Mamoru Oshii just happens to be one of my favs... thoughtful and ambitious, this movie also has a pretty good sense of humor. recommend this to anybody who likes a good sci-fi flick, probably one of Oshii's best films. basically this computer programmer devises a virus in which a whole mess of robots and computers go berserk, and since he works for one of the most powerful mecha (read giant robot) companies in the world, he can easily get his evil virus diseminated throughout witless robot owners everywhere in Japan... so now it's up to the intrepid cops in their giant robots to figure out how to stop this robot holocaust, and hopefully make sure that their robots don't freak out before that happens... cool stuff, highly recommend."
4,Complex and Detailed Anime...VERY GOOD !,"All positive comments are right on. Beware, there is not a lot of action but the caracters and plot are interesting enough to follow and enjoy. I am highly dissapointed by the DVD encoding. Who ever did the encoding did a poor job which is a bummer especially when the anime is good and deserves better !"
2,Slow... Slow... and still slower....,"I purchased this movie have never seen it before. I thought that it would be a safe bet because of all the stellar reviews of it. After all people were comparing it to Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke, it had to be good.Unfortunatly, I did not find it to be entertaining at all... in fact, I was just waiting for it to end. The plot was slow, and the characters were developed poorly. I agree that it was a bit thought provoking, but there wasn't too much to think about, its no Ghost in the Shell in this aspect.Also, the animation is a bit dated, which would be ok if the series lived up to the standards of films such as Castle of Caglistro, but it doesn't. I cannot reccomend the purcahse of this film, though with all of the other positive reviews, you might want to think about renting it to see if it suits your fancy."
2,My first review was pulled,"I love the idea of this book but it was not edited properly. ""These are the shepherds watching by night that saw the star in the sky (should be who saw the star...)"" "" This is the child that (should be who) was born.""Since this is a poetic book with repeated verses these two grammatical errors are reinforced by repetition.Also, the word ""ass"" is repeated. The grammmatical errors and the curse word do not belong in a book directed at elementary school kids.Were it not for these two (major) flaws this book would be a great addition to any library."
5,beautiful book,"the reviews convinced me to order this book-after reading it I ordered 10 more copies for Christmas gifts for all my fellow ""Grandma"" friends-it is wonderful. text & pictures are perfect."
2,Don't spend your money on this product.,"HyperSignJr - does not function on Windows XP or the CD is corrupt and their is no support from the Vendor. There others are all introductions to the products (Demo's) so only a small amount of functionality is available in the product. There is more information available via the Web than there is in these products combined.The only product in this set that is usefull is SingingAvatar Illustrated Dictionary, but there are better free sites for learning signing.Overall, very disappointing - Sorry to say."
5,great music,stumbled into this artist and i really like it. told all my friends to check her out. arrived early with no issues.
4,Humourous and entertaining,"Being fans of Tommy Lee, my girls and i loved this dvd. I had quite a few chuckles during the viewing of this series and even my husband did too, who isnt a big fan of Tommy's. Tommy is very cheeky and a big kid at heart and he never ceases entertaining us. It was good to watch the complete series continuously without missing an episode."
3,Loads of fun,"Tommy Lee is super talented and remains relevant in the music scene and scores with the younger fans. His marketing of his album along with this ""reality"" show are true genius. He is truly a fish out of water which is a riot to see. While Tommy remains the fun spirited rocker dude it is hysterical to see his piercings and tatoos intermixed with midwestern sweaters and average looking college students. Usually it is the average looking kids who feel out of place while the pierced and tatooed are the cool mysterious people. Now the rockstar looks like a goof! My personal favorite episode is when he has to make it on the drumline to play at halftime. Just a blast. His hot tutor is funny also, along with his goofy average joe dorm roommate. Even if you are not a big Tommy Lee fan, you will enjoy these DVD's."
1,Gimme a Break,"Is this what we have come to for entertainment? Truly, if this is what passes as something worthwhile, then society in general is dumber than I thought. I have a hard time believing Tommy Lee even knows how to spell 'college'. Please! This is so stupid, it was not worth me typing this review. The world is a dumber place for having this 'movie' in it. May God have mercy on our souls."
3,Amusing for both mom and son,"I had fun watching myself this series on the TV and decided to show it to my son, just to give him an idea what college life is like.Being a Motley fan, we both had fun watching this and good or bad, my son was able to see some ""real"" campus life and activities.It is difficult to explain how much fun you can have in college, but showing the DVD, they understand better what is like to be there.One thing for sure, my son decided not to take physics and chemistry."
1,Waste of time and money and brain cell energy,"I bought this DVD because I used to be a fan of Motley Crue and thought it might be kind of fun. Well, I'd like to shout at the devil that made me buy this stupid product. The entire show is staged and is purposefully set up to make it seem as though Tommy Lee is clueless and the university staff is shocked by his every move. From the frathouse pranks to the initiation ceremonies to the toga party!! Gee, very original concepts. I can hardly guess what might come next. There are no cool extras like a ""making of"" documentary, just a couple of crappy videos. And does Tommy Lee pass his courses in the end? Well, he's not even officially enrolled in the school so it hardly matters. This is one little drummer boy that needs to go back to what he does best, making porn videos."
1,Save your money for your old age,"This book had virtually no content. Obviously I was not expecting _War and Peace_ from a title like _Boomer Babes_, but I thought it might actually have useful information about, ahem, maturation and style. No, just the authors laughing a little too hard at their own tired jokes. The latest women's fashion magazine--any magazine--is more helpful.Save your money for your old age. Even compounded at five percent it will do you more good than this book."
4,This one is a MUST READ for women approaching 5-0!,"My flight across the country was hysterical because I read the entire book...twice! My husband wanted to know why I was laughing out loud...but these authors have put some humor into this ""getting more experienced"" deal! All of my friends laugh reading the cover, so my Christmas list is nearly complete! Thanks ladies for your insights and wisdom."
5,Just what you'd expect from Dietrich,"The best way to summarize the contents of this book would be to describe it as a compilation of words that attempt to describe Dietrich as she understood herself. It is rather like a journal in that she writes about her thoughts and opinions, honestly and frankly all throughout. There are no tell-all's, this is not that kind of an autobiography. Instead, reading this book will enable one to understand what motivated the woman and the actress, and what values were her priorities in life. It is very straightforward and often inspiring. There is much to learn here, and I can only say a belated thanks to the lady who was willing to share her wisdom and experience with a devoted audience."
5,Excellent Artist: Approachable and Heartfelt!,"I was so impressed by this compilation of heartwarming, comforting, and inspiring stories through song of Lisa Lynne Mathis. She is a gifted writer, musician and performer, but the most important element which is communicated here is an ability to *both* comfort and inspire.Her music is true to the heart. It is of such great quality -- and also about our real lives. It helps you navigate your day to day by inspiring a trust and love of life, and a deeper peace.I bought 20 for my Holiday Gifts for my friends and family! Especially during the Holiday season, a great way to spread Holiday peace and inspiration during a busy time.Pamela Hawley"
5,rt66,"fantastic brings back memories when they filmed an episodein my home town greentree, pgh,pa second season second show"
2,Review of Route 66,"This producat arrived quickly and was in good shape, but I'm sorry I bothered to buy it bcause the series is very dated."
5,ROUTE 66 2nd Season,More of the same with my older brother infatuation with the show and THE CAR! Two guys traveling the country helping or fighting people wherever they went...
4,"Love R66, but disc 1 had bad sector","You don't get better TV drama than R66, except for Naked City which was also written largely by Sterling Silliphant. I recently received this boxed set from Amazon and was glad to see it was full screen. I was happily watching until I came across a bad sector in the final scenes of Blue Murder; I had to ship it back, and will re-order as soon as Amazon refunds my money. Has anyone else encountered bad spots on this set? I've used Amazon many, many years and never had a defect, so I guess I was due one."
2,I can see any difference,I did some long term torture tests with Epson Velvet paper coated and uncoated. I tracked the time and exposed them to the exact same amount of extreme sun and wet conditions. After many months (equivalent to decades properly stored or on display indoors) I could not see any difference.The Epson Matte black ink still transfers to another piece of paper with or without coating.Maybe it works on some Hahnemuhle papers?
2,If you like breathing bad stuff this is for you.,"I wanted to try this protective coating on my large canvas prints but I will never use it again. This filled my garage and another room in the house with a very visible mist and hung in the air for quite awhile. It has a strong toxic smell and even with a mask I am left with a bad taste. Not sure how many coating I need to use but my picture now looks mottled as in the spray did not go on even. To be fair I was trying to coat a photo on canvas that was about 34"" x 46"". I have been using another product that I have to roll on and is a bit of a hassle but I don't feel like I'm breathing in toxins like using this.It says the area you spray in needs to be well ventilated. WEll, you better do it outside cause this stuff is nasty."
2,This author does not believe in UFO's,"The author states many facts about UFO,s and different sightings. But at the end in the last chapter he states that he doesn't believe they exist. I did read about some facts that I didn't know or didn't remember. No mention was made of the Roswell New Mexico crash landing in 1947. I would not recommend this book because it was written by someone who states that he does not believe UFO's exist. There are many other much better books out there on the subject."
3,More of the same,"If you are deeply into the world of alien visitations, project Blue Book and alien spacecraft sightings, then this may be what you are looking for. After years of perusing the literature, I find this to be more of the same."
4,Goddamn funny - goddamn brutal!,"Title of my review says it all - this is brutally funny, even if you don't like metal - its prob'ly funnier if you don't.My only ciriticism is, given the star-studded line-up of voices (Hetfield, King Diamond, Corpsegrinder, etc), it would've been neat to have some studio footage as an extra, or some ""making of"" kinda stuff.Other than that, this owns you and your mum, and the makers definitely desrve ""a banana sticker""!\m/\m/"
4,Damn this looks good,"It might be my flat-screen HD tv, but the animation is really looking hot on this DVD, a lot sharper and more vivid than it did on Adult Swim. I love Metalocalpyse, and that other show Brendon Small did for Adult Swim (Home Movies), but I wasn't expecting the animation to look so much better on DVD. Of course it's one of the best shows evar, or you wouldn't get this DVD. I didn't give this 5 stars because the special features were pointless and really really cheaply animated. They don't add anything to the show, and I think they are actually a detraction, since the comedy is a hacked version of the real show. So just ignore the special features and enjoy the episodes. You can watch them over and over again. And I must quote one of my favorite lines from this season: ""Is this metal frosting? Amazing!"" ""Please do not sample the frosting. It's made of mercury...you'll die."" Does some one end up sampling that frosting? You betcha."
5,The Metalocalypse has begun!,"This is an awesome DVD set that anyone who is a fan of the show should buy. It is worth the money. A cartoon about a fictionaly death metal band couldn't be a better premise, but this show is accented with awesome original music. What would have made this even better is if they had some sort of commentary, esspecially if it was done by the fictional band members. However, one cannot complain with the bonus features that are included. Buy it, enough said!"
3,Disappointing DVD release,"I received my copy of Season 1 of Metalocalypse. To my utter disappointment they chose to release it in 4:3 letter boxed format not enhanced for 16:9 TVs. There is no 5.1 DD audio mix. To top it off the audio is censored stereo DD 2.0. There is no commentary, music videos, making of, Just these Easter Eggs: Disc 1: there are ""bloopers"" Disc 2: there are interviews with the band already available on the AS website and a tour of Mordhaus.This show is still pretty metal, but I can't kill myself to it because of this crappy DVD release.Show: 6 Stars DVD: 3 Stars and I am being generous."
5,i love this show,they incorporate little subtle references to metal bands and this is a hilariously brutal show. the songs are epic.
2,Save Your Money,"I agree with other reviewers that have actually viewed the DVD set. It's the exact same as the TV shows. I feel cheated. I still love the show and I'd rather have this DVD set than nothing at all, but it could have been done so much better. No extras, just the same shows that were broadcast on CTN including the censoring, which was really surprising to me for an unrated DVD set of an adult show."
1,Absolute waste!,"This is a refreshingly original show using a genre of music that is often ignored and cast into the darkness because it is ""evil"". It's got a lot of promise to be something great. So why is my rating so low? I'm rating the DVD not the show. When I heard of the show's release on DVD, I was excited because I was sure the show, unlike on Cartoon Network, would be uncensored on DVD which is a standard practice nowadays for shows that use strong profanity and violence. To my disgust, it's presented just like on TV!That pick squeal guitar noise sounding in place of every profane word is fine on TV but not on DVD! Sorry, Williams Street, but censorship is a travesty; no money for you, ever. And I heard it's the same with the season 2 DVD except for the Easter eggs and special features so I disapprove of it as well! Maybe they'll get the message for the season 3 DVD set which will inevitably come out."
3,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is a funny show with losts of subtle humor interwoven throughout each 11 minute episode.My extreme disappointment results from popping in Disc 1, only to reveal that the original 16x9 image had been ingloriously letterboxed to 4x3. This was what I would have expected from DVD in 1997, not 2007. Really, really poor Williams Street, Adult Swim, Warner Brothers DVD."
1,Really,"I oredered this 2 months ago with King of the Hill season 1. I've recieved King of the Hill but not Metalocalypse yet. What? And i've read some of this guys reviews... and I think some of us might be getting ripped off. Also, when I contacted him about not recieving the item yet, he didn't really reply. It was a 3 word response pretty much."
4,Brutal!,"What needs to be said. Besides this is the most Brutal show out there! If your a fan of the show, I would pick this up. Cant wait for season 2!"
2,"Rating is about picture issues, not about show.","The episodes on this set are great. This is a great show. I love it. Five stars.If you have a standard TV, you will have no problem with this set. If you have an HDTV, this is a frustrating DVD set. This is a 1:85 show. The show itself is shaped like your HDTV. It should fit the area of your screen exactly. Instead, your DVD player will either stretch it lengthwise with black bars on the top and bottom or it will have black on all four sides depending on your DVD player's settings. You can probably make your TV or DVD player zoom or stretch to make the picture fit your HDTV, but that's not how it should be.Perhaps they figured that the type of people who like Metalocalypse are broke metalhead idiots who can't afford nice TVs. Perhaps they're mostly justified in thinking that, but I'm still mad.Special features are underwhelming. No commentaries or behind-the-scenes. Fake interviews with the band are mildly funny."
1,The OTHER Rock Music,"I don't like screaming as a ""musical"" style. So I didn't care for the music at all. Someone who likes this genre may really enjoy it."
3,Dethklok rulez...Dvd producers drool...,"Ok. The show is great. Everyone knows that. The dvd transfer looks pretty good and the eps tend to look better than they did on broadcast. A 5.1 mix would have been nice, but the DD 2.0 is solid. So why only 3 stars? It is absolutely shameful that a show broadcast in letterbox/widescreen format would not be reproduced on dvd in anamorphic format. Shame on you, producers. Shame! Especially when other adult swim shows (Boondocks for example) ARE enhanced for widescreen tvs..."
5,THE RE-RETURN OF METAL,"Metal has sucked outside of the dimmest lowliest scum-infested underground for a long time. The best bands have been suckerpunched and waylaid to the corners of fandom with the mainstream media sucking their little doll-thumbs to boybands or american idols. Enter DETHKLOK, secretly members of some of the most badas metal bands out there, who take the hardest most brutal metal out there and condense it down into some of the sickest, hardest, teeth-shattering while you scream along riffs and harmonies ever heard. Even if metal ist your thing, this bad rules! They made the first muilti-platinum selling product jingle of all time, for christsakes!sewn back together wrong. that's all i'm saying."
3,Could have been so much better,"Could be that my expectations were way too high, but the one thing I really wanted on this disc wasn't there - a commentary track.I won't bother to review the series. If I didn't like it I wouldn't have bought the DVD.Video and audio quality are good, so no complaints there, but the hidden extras are unfunny and go on way too long without a payoff. Metalocalypse's art was never its strong point, and here even the dialogues and monologues are boring.I buy DVDs to listen to the commentaries and learn more about the stories and the creative process. Big disappointment."
3,Loud enough to give you a headache,I purchased this DVD after seeing a segment on an iphone of a friend during Thanksgiving dinner. The vignettes are loud and the characters amazingly stupid. I wish the 2007 campaign for president was as good!
2,More recipes...,"I was hoping for more, easy.. you already have in your home type sorbet recipes. Many of them, have items that a normal consumer just would not have in the household. I am not about to go around town looking for turkish rose water, or sauternes wine. The book is colorful, great pictures, but I want more ""common, easy"" sorbet recipes."
4,good but what will marvel do next?,long awaiting this set... but is Marvel going to screw us over again and not release the last season of the series like they did with X-men Evolution?
3,Come off in dishwasher,I use this marker to label my daughters bottles for daycare and the ink is more attractive than a regular permanent marker but it comes off in the dishwasher.
5,Great for marking dark things.,"Wonderful for writing on black (or other dark) craft paper, such as for photo albums. Good for marking black computer cabling - Monitor, Keyboard, etc - so when you go to reattach to a new computer, you know what goes where."
5,Need something to write on dark backgounds this is your choice!,I'm a nerd and was going to a convention and had a box that was quite dark to have signed. I needed something that would write visably on said box and dry quickly. I turned to these sharpies. They did exactly what I needed for only a few bucks! Totally worth it in my eyes. Not only did they write on dark paper but they were also metallic so they shine and look quite awesome.
4,Good not Great,"Not much to say it's a two pack of silver sharpies. Work great writing on dark surfaces, leaves a nice thick layer. My only complaint is that if you are like me and plan to use these heavily buy extra they never last long."
5,Sharpie markers are great,These silver markers are excellent for writing on dark surfaces. I've used Sharpie for work for many years and silver is a necessary addition to red/black/green/blue.
3,Silver Markers,"These markers have a nice ""sheen"" but no shine to their ink. And I definitely would NOT call them fine point. I used them on my gift tags and for a marker, I would call them a medium point. That being said, they are good quality as most Sharpie items are and I know I will have other uses for them."
3,"Smoky House, by Elizabeth Goudge","I first read this book when I was about 16 years of age. It is a lovely story based in the West Country of England, which is a place where the doorway between the world of the 18th Century and that of the world of faery is still open, and the little people can be called upon at night to magically help keep house. The story has everything in it - smugglers, hangings, children on a mission, bad guys, good guys and a stubborn donkey. I loaned my copy of this book (which was a birthday present) to a friend years ago and am now seeking a copy to share with my daughter. I thoroughly recommend it - even if it does persist with silly ideas like babies coming from the cabbage patch!"
2,The Underacheiving Way : Getting the Least from the Most,"I have to give Dean Smith credit -- he's one hell of a salesman. The fact that so many people have bought into his hokum despite a truly dismal track record of on-court performance is impressive. As my old high school coach said, ""My grandma could have coached Carolina to 5 National Championships by now."" Somehow, Dean has managed to prevent some of the most talented teams in history from even making it the Final 4. Also, while Dean may pontificate about ""loyalty"" and ""honor"", here is a coach that would run off a bench scholarship player to free up a scholarship for the next season.Look, I'm a big college hoops fan and some of the antecdotes about the game were cool, but the reality is that Dean Smith is, at best, a decent college coach who doesn't know anything more about leadership than the McDonald's night manager."
3,"Great for sharpening things in a pinch, but only that.","Got this to try and sharpen some knives we have in our kitchen, along with a pocket knife I keep on me. It seems to work, but this is only meant to slightly improve the cutting edge, not professionally hone it. It seems to wear out fast. Not bad, otherwise."
5,D.J. Miko is incredible,"This is a wonderful CD, and I love the New Groove, the instrumental. He is the hottest artist in the techno/electrnica/D.J./dance charts, and I love the way he has an influence on all four of them."
3,Chopping and Editing...,"I remember Rona's big specials, and I remember the one with Cher. This isn't the same footage that aired with the original. At the start of the original footage, it showed Rona going thru the gates of Cher's mansion, driving up to the front door. I enjoyed the interviews with Carol Burnett and Donna Summer. Both women consistent throughout their careers. Looking back at what they said then, and how the live now, very impressive. I imagine this is being test marketed for future DVD's - so I expect more of the same interviews to appear on those as well? Either way I much prefer Rona's persona as opposed to Barbara Walters."
2,Ann-Margret Not Included,"Very disappointed Rona did not include her interview with Ann-Margret. In 1975, Rona hosted a special titled ""Rona Looks At Liza, Cher, Raquel and Ann-Margret"". Sadly, they were not included in this release."
4,Sensual and highly erotic...I wanted more!,"This book follows the lives of two women, one a nurse and the other her patient who has lost her memory due to an automobile accident. As time unfolds, our patient, in her recurring dreams finds there is someone lurking in the far reaches of her mind yet unable to be seen clearly enough to identify. The passage which is travelled to find the memory she wishes to regain is filled with an intense level of feeling and emotion and a highly charged sensual and sexual flavor. It made me hot just reading it and I longed for more."
3,twolves stocking,It was a lot smaller than it looks. The dimensions should be given in inches for a better idea of product size.
3,Blondie - Heart Of Glass,"Blondie's most famous song gets workable remixes from MK, Richie Jones, and Diddy. MK keeps his cut-and-paste tendencies to a minimum, preserving the main vocals in a deep, rolling mix. Richie Jones does a typical club mix, while Diddy opts for a more HI-NRG approach. But, really, can anything even approach the original? The song is a classic for obvious reasons."
5,Excellent,"I almost gave up on getting this order, but to my greatest surprise it came and was like a new one."
2,A remarkable accomplishment,"Academic prose can often be boring, but anthropology usually has some at least some interest; if the author can't write, at least the people he studies might be interesting. This author's accomplishment is therefore remarkable: writing an anthro study with no insight and no interest.The subject is an important one: what happens in a diaspora of a diaspora? Armenian refugees in Cyprus become Cypriot-Armenian refugees in London. All the more reason to demand a thoughtful and insightful treatment."
5,talent!,"I think that Westlife have got so much talent and energy and they are not like every other boy band,they have some thing special like the looks,the moves,the voices and they know when to be serious and when they can have a laugh.They are not the only good boy band,Nsync are also really good.Most boy bands are being compared with all the rest including Westlife,which i think is wrong because every one is an individual.Maybe they are a like in the way that their a band with boys in,but the girl groups never got compared with each other,did they?"
3,cd for westlife album.,i want to know about the westlife album... so how to get the album.. and t-shirt or other buying info?..bye..
3,"So, So Band","I thought this band was OKAY. In my opinion its songs are too slow. Okay sure some songs and lyrics are good but come on, we need some fast paces songs also. The thing is in this album all the songs are love songs with really slow beat. I think they should have a mixture of different types of songs. Like some fast and some slow. I think this band will soon disappear. It will be kind of like the Hansons and the Moffats. People will love them in the begining and then soon they will kind of evaporate."
5,Coast to Coast,"I bought the cd ""Coast to Coast"", because I am a big fan of this GREAT boy-band. The first album was great, the second is SUPER. Great singles, especially 'My Love', 'I Lay My Love On You','When You're Looking Like That' and 'Loneliness Knows Me By Name'. No, I think all the numbers are cool.Well done: Shane, Kian, Nicky, Brian and Mark."
1,pitiful effort - westilife,"every song on this album is a ballad. every song basically sounds the same. their music is extremely unoriginal. they sound like most boy bands and i feel that this inparticular boy band has to be the most unworthy as oppose to the bacstreet boys, five, and nsync. they are all better. the only reason i think this cd deserves 1 star is for the first track, my love. why not just buy that single? this cd is in no way worth the money."
4,Second album is just as good,"This is Westlifes second studio album and as with the first they have managed to produced a whole album of beautifull ballads and pop songs. Featuring two UK number ones (My Love and Against All Odds the one with Mariah Carey) It might be fair to say that Westlife could of chosen a different direction for this album, but i feel that they would of lost that unique appeal that they have at the moment. With 7 UK no1's under their belt now they are strongly becoming Irelands greatest export since U2. Congratulations to the boys on a successful second album."
5,Westlife's Coast to Coast Album:SUPERB!!!!,"Westlife's new album, Coast to Coast is well worth my money. From top to bottom selection, everything is so relaxing (in my point of view..)..Especially the songs I Lay My Love on You, Nothing is Impossible, and Soledad. Not to forget of course, My Love!!!!It's nice to have...and nice to hear... believe me..."
5,Westlife - Coast to coast,"When my sister bought this CD I didn't expected very much of it. But, I was suprised. This boys from Ireland really did great songs. With lots of slow songs full of emotions they added some fast, too. CD is great to listen. I expecialy like Angel's wings, What makes a man, Soledad and of course- My love. Great CD!"
4,Westlife back again..,"Wow, you've got to admit, if they tie a record with the Beatles then these guys are awesome!I must admit though, when I first heard Westlife and saw them.. they all looked alike and it irritated me so much because as I watched ""Fool Again"" it seemed as if there were more than 7 band members although there are only 5!!But anyway, this album is great! They even cover a few songs like ""My Girl."" Good vocals!All I can say is if you have the album ""Westlife"" then you'll enjoy this CD.It's strictly non NSYNC-ed!No disappointment here!"
5,Westlife: Coast to Coast,"I think that this CD is just amazing. Only problem is that I do not know how to listen all songs from that CD. If you are not romantic or something like that, then you'd better don't buy or listen this. All songs remind me in some great love-story that happened millions years ago. Well, what can I say? I simply love it!"
3,Al'right,"Bruce Barth, one the most active pianist in New-York jazz scene. Plays mainstream jazz. From the beginning, Bruce has a nice phrasing, we can recognize some influences (Little Ditty reminds me of Fred Hersch playing) and In the Still of the night is a great up-tempo. Al Foster on drums is no longer to be introduced (he played with Miles Davis cf. We Want Miles, and in the format trio teamed up with the best pianists = longtime trio with Tommy Flanagan and George Mraz...), and Ugonna Okwego is a one-time famous bassist because of his team up with Jacky Terrasson back in the early 90s.This is good piano jazz. A little moment's happiness. As far as Evidence (Monk composition) is concerned, try Kenny Werner's Peace and compare both interpretations. It's worth while."
2,"Very unprofessional, mounting screws not included & more...","All towel bars include matching screws, except these.They told me that this is noted in the listing, but that's not true.Then they told me to go to the hardware store & buy some screws.Then they told me to use a black magic marker on the screws.Extremely unprofessional!"
2,"Poor Production, your better of with sattellite","I've been listening to the new album Sattellite and to listen to brown is to listen to an inferior album. One of the biggest problems is production. The vocals sound horrible and distorted, and thats not in a good way. Its bad enough that it makes it hard to listen to the album. Snuff the punk had better production in those areas. Many will say they didn't have the money for it, but thats no exscuse. In the end if your looking for the best pod album then check out Sattelite, because brown doesn't deliver."
5,"The best ""rapcore"" band ever!",I've been fallowing the Christian Punk/Hardcore scene for about five or six years and P.O.D. is one of the best bands I've ever heard christian or secular. They aren't just good musicians they live what they preach which is more than I can say about a lot of bands.
4,CRAAZZYYY ROCK MAN!!!!!!,"This album just rocks!!!!! its not the best by p.o.d. but its still very good! The very best songs would be Know Me, Selah(the best), One Day, Breathe Babylon, Funk Jam, and Live And Die"
3,This CD is alright. . .but not P.O.D. at its best,"This CD is okay, I mean, I stick it in my CD player from time to time, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite. Some songs rock fairly hard, but sometimes they are kind of slow and kind of choppy.I personally think that P.O.D.'s other stuff, such as 'The Fundamental Elements of Southtown' or 'Sattelite', but it is alright for a band. It's definately not my favorite, but just barely good enough to get a positive rating."
3,Their best work,"To start off let me say I was a warrior for many years and I loved POD. However, times I change. I lost faith in christianity a few years ago. Musically, I also grew sick of how rampant nu metal and rap metal where. Coming originally from a hip hop background it sounded great to me in the beginning but came off as a tired and fake gimmick soon after as I began to get into classic rock, metal and hardcore. However, now and then I'll pop this album in and I find it to be POD's best work, with nice guitar work from Marcos and bass work from Traa.POD has since gone downhill, and it turns out they where not nearly as righteous and god-fearing as everyone thought. But I still like to take a trip down memory lane with this one."
5,P.O.D-Brown Rap? Or Rock.,P.O.D Brown is not like Satellite at all.Brown is More Metal Like Really Harcore.Brown is there best album and coolest album ever Made.P.O.D is becoming more Rap than Rock .Satellite Is Like Rap-Rock so I Really Hope P.O.D Next Album Is Rock Becuse I HATE! Rap Not P.O.D Rap But Still That dosnt mean thay Can turn RAP!.Sonny-Marcos-Traa-Wuv Keep Rockin. P.O.D IS THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD. Andrew Meyer
5,P.O.D. is amazing,"P.O.D. delivers once again, The Fundamental Elements Of Southtown is their best release yet. I urge you to get this album, if you are a fan of Limp Bizkit, Rage Againest The Machine. In my opinion these guys are better than the afore mentioned bands. Also try to get your hands on their previous releases; Snuff The Punk, Brown, P.O.D. Live, and The Warriors EP. The message of JESUS CHRIST shines through these 4 men. See them live if you get the chance, they tear up the stage. They speak of positivity in this otherwise dark world of negative, self serving music groups who have nothing to do but lift themselves up and speak of their sexual conquests or how ""tough"" they think they are. I personally met the 4 members and know that they are 4 of the most genuine people you will ever meet."
2,I was expecting more,"Here I was in the store, rejoicing that I finally found ""Brown""! I had heard about it, hadn't heard it, so I bought it. I was in for a surprise - POD just, well, wasn't very good back in their olden days. It feels like the wrote one long song with absolutely no musical variation, chopped it up into little lengths and called them songs. The only reason we've got 2 stars instead of 1 is because the lyrics are the saving grace. (although they did somehow manage to butcher ""Full Color""). Still, if you're a hardcore fan, go for it. I'm not one, so I just get disappointed."
1,"POD fan says ""this sucks bad""","I really do enjoy POD as much as the next person. But this CD is not really a step forward. The words are barely heard and the sound is simply terrible. I'm sure that even a semi- okay producer could have done a job 10 times better. Save your money for the follow on to their latest release ""Payable On Death"". I regret buying this CD."
3,it's o.k.,oh it reads well and there are a few cool stories in it-anyone who has read any zeppelin might not get much new here though. my opinion is that the book by richard cole is the best tell all you can get today.
3,"Love Nag Champa, but...","I have always loved nag champa and I ran out about three months ago. I was happy to see that I could add it on to my Christmas order. Because of the description by weight not number I was really disappointed in the price, outrageously expensive. If I lived somewhere that it wasn't available it would be a different story. Just beware it's a little pricey, otherwise 5 stars."
3,Denso O2 Sensor,The Denso 234-4153 Oxygen Sensor that I purchased did not seem to be an exact OEM replacement as advertised. The flange was larger than the original and the holes in the flange did not line up with the studs. I had to work for a while with a round metal file to make it fit.
4,"All this time later, and still quite good","The tepid 2009 remake of The Stepfather did manage to conjure up one good thing: it meant that we would finally have a proper release of Joseph Ruben's original shocker. Before he was best known as John Locke on Lost, Terry O'Quinn played Jerry Blake, a man who seeks familial perfection however he can get it. After wasting away his family, Jerry moves onto a single mom (Shelley Hack) and her teenage daughter (Jill Schoelen), who suspects that there is definitely something wrong with her stepdad. And boy, she couldn't be any more right. Though a bit dated, The Stepfather is still a compelling, frightening trip, with a spectacularly demented performance from O'Quinn that those who only know him for his work on Lost will definitely be in for a surprise once they see this. Needless to say, forget the recent, needless remake, and check out the original, and best, The Stepfather."
4,If you are a fan of the x-files...,"There are at least six actors who have roles or bit parts in this film that appeared on the X-Files (and Millennium) TV series. Since I am a fan of the X-Files series, it made watching this film all the more fun. If I'd known that, I would've gotten a drinking game started! I hadn't seen The Stepfather since I rented it on videotape back in the 80's. It still holds up well and is quite entertaining, though the quality of this DVD transfer shows that this film is in serious need of a restoration. I hope somebody gets around to it so that it can be transferred to hi-def blu-ray. If Night of the Creeps can get the kick ass royal hi-def treatment, why can't The Stepfather?"
4,"""Who Am I Here?""","I received this as an early Christmas present. After I saw the remake, I wanted to see the original. This movie is very good and really creepy. A psychopath marries women with children and kills them because he wants the 'American Dream' Jerry Blake is newly married again and has a step-daughter named Stephanie who is suspicious of Jerry. After a while, Jerry finally breaks down and tries to kill his family again. I highly recommend THE STEPFATHER!!!"
2,The List Murders,"This film was based on the List Murders that occurred in my town (Westfield NJ) in '71, I believe. Actually when I say based, I actually mean Loosely based/influenced by. I remember seeing TSF in the theatre as a kid, & thinking it was kinda cheesy. I'll pick it up 'cause I'm curious to see it as an adult. They also produced an (awful/inaccurate) TV movie not long after List was caught, after being on the lam for about 17 years. List was played by actor Robert Blake, ironically. David Caruso (CSI ?) played chief Moran who actually hired me in my law enforcement career. I read recently that the producers of the original film were surprised at how close some of their scenes/story lines, came to pass when List was finally apprehended long after the film was released. Kinda cool. Enjoy the DVD."
4,It's about time this one showed up!,"Blu-Ray. Having patiently waited years for this one to come out, we felt sure that when the crappy re-make came out, they'd put this on disk to take advantage of the moment (we've all seen it happen before). But no, they didn't. Finally released on Blu-Ray and DVD, those who were too young to see this one will get a chance. Blu-Ray quality was just fine. It's worth the money just to see Terry O'Quinn with a full head of hair (hah)."
4,"Great film, one flaw","I'm on board with everyone, and happened to watch this film just as it started, like the first reviewer, not knowing what it was about, then saw the guy walk down the stairs, past the dead bloody bodies and thought, what have we hear? (Interestingly enough, another movie I watched under similar circumstances, many years earlier, was The Bad Seed.)But the flaw: Jerry did not go so far from the scene of his earlier crime. And it was a big crime. His photograph would have been in the papers for miles. People in his new hometown would have recognized him. Fast. But if you can put that plot point aside, a hell of a scary movie. Even Shelly Hack is good, and the girl, Jill something, is very, very good."
5,cool flick,"good movie about a psychopath. interesting plot, unexpected twists, decent acting, inadvertently funny well worth the cost..wtf why does this have a word minimum? isnt it my review?"
5,Wonderful!,I just loved this movie. I just wish there was more of this movie. I didn't even know of white lions until seeing this film. I thought that the white lion was so handsome. Just like my own little white house cat lion at home. I love how this wasnarrated and told from the young trackers point of view.
2,Go with African Cats.,"Told a good story, but realized at the end in the bonus materials that the white lion in the film is not in the wild situation, there is a lot of human manipulation during the filming. I love the African Cats more."
5,As good (or better) than any Disney film!,"I recently got to watch an advance showing of ""White Lion"" and can only say that if you aren't already an animal lover, this film should make one of you! My first comment after watching the film was that it was as good as any comparable Disney flick I've ever seen (and that says a LOT!)I recommend the ""White Lion"" for everyone!"
2,Blahhh,"I bought this book expecting the kind of insight and farfetched storys the good doctor is known to write about. This book is merely a group of letters. Letter after letter. After letter.Despite my affinity for HST and his wacky ""I Do What I Want"" attitude, this book merely has me thinking ""Why am I reading this and why do I care"".In his writing, you see his style evolve through the years. But I only found this to be a good toilet book that I can pick up for 10 minutes. I am disappointed.One the up side, I find it pleasant to appreciate his actual letters and see him as a deeper man than before. I give this book 2 stars."
4,worth reading if you like HST,"This book reminds me of Bob Dylan's collections of outtakes that are released every few years in a box set: They're better than the stuff he chose to put out on his regular albums. If you like HST, this book is definitely worth it. Much of it is a lot better than anything Thompson's published in the last 20 years. It's also fun to watch the evolution of his style."
4,thompson readers.,if you like HST and are interested in wether or not the myth holds true to the legend...well this is your proof. god bless the sixties.n.y.
4,Great for the office or the shop.,Many People are looking for a small space heater for there office. You can save energy by turning back your main thermostat and using a small heater. This device will warm your feet and much of the area right under your desk and it only uses 90- 120 watts. Most small space heaters use 1000 watts minimum. This device does cause a an odor of hot rubber. It's pretty strong the first couple of days but it is quite a bit less after a week or so. I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and there still is a little odor but not bad.
1,Boring,"I am a big Anita Blake fan. When this book was mentioned as being in the same league with Anita, I gave it a try, hoping to find another heroine who could stand up toe to toe with the big boys and come out a clear winner.Instead I found a story so buried in prose and deviations from the story line that I had to force myself after Part One to continue to read the story, hoping there was some good to come out of it. Instead, I found a story so boring and so convoluted with unnecessary backtracking that I found I could skip pages and not miss a beat on the main story line.The final epic battle is so vague and muddied up that I'm still not clear on what happened. It was like trying to watch a war movie on TV through a fogged up shower door, you got a sense of what was happening but nothing clear or definite ever emerged.If you are an Anita Blake fan, don't bother with this book."
3,Who was the editor?,"Although the book it quite detailed and the plot is unique, it is also full of grammatical and spelling errors. I'm nitpicky about those things so I got annoyed every time I caught a mistake. The book dragged along in some parts so I had to push through to get to the end. A majority of the book is about Sunshine's self-discovery of her father's past, her powers, and her cinnamon rolls (when nothing supernatural is happening, she seems very obsessed with baking). It takes a while for the plot to get going. I also wish there was more Constantine in the book. Other than that, it is an okay read. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Boring!!!!,"Let me start off by saying that I am so glad that I did not pay the retail price for this book. Or I would have been steaming mad after I finished this book .The book in my opinion was very hard to keep reading there was nothing really to grap my intrest and what really bugs me is the main character she does more talking than action and her personality oh, dont get me started it was annoying and I can go on and on about reasons why I hate this book but previous reviewrs pointed the main problems out already so checkout their more detailed reviews; any way the main point is that if you want to read this book I suggest you check it out from the library or buy it cheap because its not worth the retail price TRUST me!!!"
5,Please write another one...,"This was my first book by this author. I don't know much about magic, so maybe she just has a good imagination, but the book was very different - in a good way - from other paranormal type novels that I have read. It was not flowery. I related to the main character. She was no hero, just a person who found her inner hidden hero when the time called for it. At first I was annoyed at McKinley's long discriptions of sticky buns and the coffee shop, by the end I felt like I knew the character's world insside and out and I was greatful for those descriptions."
2,Such a Let-down,"Robin McKinley's ""Sunshine"" is a supernatural thriller featuring a very unique central character. Rae Seddon is the daughter of a once very powerful sorcerer, Onyx Blaise. From her father, Rae inherited the power of transmutation, which comes in very handy once she has been kidnapped by a gang of vampires. The vampires that kidnap Rae bring her to a vampire named Constantine as ""dinner"". Constantine is their prisoner as well. Rae and Constantine form an unlikely bond to break free from their captors and overcome the darkness that haunts them both.I really enjoyed ""Sunshine"" but I was still very let-down by it. I had been wanting to read this novel for quite some time and then when I finally did, I was disappointed. There was entirely too much monologue and virtually not action. McKinley tended to be a bit too wordy at times. I have heard that as the chief complaint of others who have read this novel."
3,"Great story line, O.K. writing","I normally really enjoy Robin McKinley's books. She writes very engaging stories that smooth reads. This one was not as enjoyable for me. I thought it was interesting but I excpected a bit more in the writing. I found it to be very choppy and disjounted, lacking McKinley's normal fluent writing style. It also did not provide enough background regarding historical aspects (ie the wars) of her story. I felt like I was plowing through some sections and at other times I was a bit confused. I really liked the characters and the story line. Sunshine/Rae was engaging and interesting. I always like stories about those striving to be normal but unable to deny their uniqueness. I'd enjoy more tales abot this characters. Maybe additional tales might give some clarifications of story lines."
5,Can't wait for more,"This was an amazing book. I have been a big fan of Robin McKinley's (Beauty is one of my all-time favorites), but this is the first adult novel I've read of hers. She did a wonderful job with presenting a vampire story and world with a couple refreshing twists. The human characters are round and real. Rae Seddon is not your classic heroine, but she's not just a normal-person-in-unusual-circumstances, either. She's cynical, sarcastic, has long run-on stream of consciousness sentences, and slowly discovers her own capacities for bravery and determination. The vampire characters range from chillingly evil (very very bad guy) to mysterious and keeping a suspiciously tight lid on its ""evil"" nature.Incredibly descriptive language--if you like pastries, watch out! you'll gain 5 pounds just by reading--and a story that keeps you glued to the pages, this book is a great read. I definitely want to see more of this world and these characters."
2,Should be 1/2 as long,"The book has many interesting concepts, but would be much more enjoyable if it was 1/2 as long. The heroine's obsession with cinnabon and chocolate gets old during their first description. I finished the book by evil willpower alone."
4,Left wanting more...,"I really enjoyed ""Sunshine"", but I wasn't ready for it to end when it did... I need MORE. I hope there will be a sequel (pretty please!!!)."
5,Great characters and a lot of fun!,"I like only some vampire books, and this is one of the best ever. The characters are fantastic, so if character development is something you enjoy in a novel, you should love this. I never re-read books, and I have re-read this one several times. It is simply one of the best books I've read in years. Can't wait for the sequel!"
2,Not enough Con!,"Over all...The book was okay. After reading some reviews, I thought this was going to be the next great vampire book. Eegad! It had it's moments to be great and then those moments fizzled out. I felt that there were too many darn cinnamon rolls and not enough Constantine! I might as well have read the rundown on Bubba's (Forest Gump) shrimp recipes. A little more interaction with her new Vampire ""friend"" would have kicked this story up a notch or two."
3,Good First Attempt,"I just finished this book and found it a bit slow moving and failing to keep my interest. I was lost on some of the names/terms McKinley was using without any background as to what/who they were etc. Mainly though, the narrative is constantly halted by Sunshines interpretations of her world, which gets to be a little redundant. I found myself skipping pages at various points. These aside, the storyline is interesting and Mckinley takes the vampire novel in an original direction."
2,I just can't get excited about cinnamon buns,"I have never cared much for Robin McKinley's books, finding her style a bit ponderous for my taste. At first I thought I was going to enjoy this book more than the others, but soon found myself getting bored. The plot is just too slow-moving, nothing happens for ages and ages. Most of the time the heroine is thinking, or talking about her job in a coffe shop bakery, dwelling at great length on her speciality, cinnamon buns. I read more about cinnamon buns in the first 100 or so pages of this book than I ever wish to read in a lifetime. And when she isn't brooding on her cinnamon buns it's muffins or something. And the vampire, who I assume is going to be the hero, is there for a while and then he dissapears and isn't seen again for ages, he hadn't turned up again by the time I gave up on the book. He's a boring vampire anyway. If you want to read a fun vampire story try Tanya Huff's Blood series, or Susan Sizemore, this book is tedious."
5,A great book (even though too much detail)!,"A wonderful, moving story wrapped in too much extraneous detail. It keeps going off on annoying tangents, with long paragraphs giving way too much detail about the heroine's everyday life at the bakery where she works. It still gets 5 stars in my book, though, simply for the beauty of the core story, which is still resonating in my mind several weeks after reading it. I didn't want it to end! Robin McKinley somehow has the ability to connect with readers on a subconscious emotional level, in the manner of folk tales and legends. I feel that her book Deerskin is one of the best books I have ever read."
1,I now know what it feels like to have blue balls,"In this volume McKinley crafts an amazing world, slowly immersing us into this original creation of hers with all sorts of mind-blowing reveals happening in the last fifth of the book. It's a true masterpiece of a first book in a series...But there is no series.The book just ends.I feel like McKinley had an acute onset of performance anxiety which prevented her from continuing this epic story in a fantastical world with all these fascinating characters, and that ruins the entire book for me. She's adamant on her website that there will be no continuation and she's tired of people asking for that, and she has a ban on anyone continuing the story on their own. I can understand not wanting fanfiction written, but it almost feels as though McKinley is being a spoiled five year old who grabs all her toys and announces she's going home.Don't bother reading this book, it'll just leave you feeling unfulfilled and cranky."
4,very dark,the book is not really about the event of Sunshine being taken by the vampire but more of the aftermath. it is dragged out a lot. we read about her emotions and life style more than anything else. shes sounds totally traumatized and is unable to connect with anyone she used to love. the scenes that involve her family or boyfriend or even friends are very short and written as if the author doesn't want us thinking about themthe language was nasty too. i actually got this book from my high school library. Imagine that.. and they are questioning The Chocolate War? they should take a look at this book.if it had been a bit shorter and the unimportant stuff left out i would have liked it. Sunshine's depression and emotional thoughts get a bit boring.
5,Fabulous!,"I must say that I really enjoyed this book. I felt like I was inside Sunshine's head, experiencing everything right along with her. There were some interesting parallels to ""The Hero and the Crown."" Heroine with untapped powers who must fight evil and falls for an impossible guy who heals her of a deadly injury. I have read some of the criticisms--that the other characters are not fully developed--and I agree. But I don't think that takes away from the power of the book at all. Rather, I think it is simply a function of the way the book is written. Those characters are important only in how they affect our heroine, and that can be learned simply from reading her inner monologue. Great book!"
2,"Too much talk, not enough action","This book seemed promising. It got right to the action in the begining and it was suspenseful. But once that bit of the story was over with, it slowed way down. About two hundred pages were filled with pointless yapping and I had to force myself to keep reading by thinking ok, it's going to get interesting soon. Alright, any time now. My hopes were in vain. The climax was way too short and the evil character that Rae was trying to protect herself against was beaten quickly and easily. I didn't even know the main character's name for the first half of the book. Waste of time!"
5,I couldn't put it down,"Rae is a baker unaware of her latent talents. One night, she makes a bad choice, pushing her to embrace her heritage and question everything she took for granted.I couldn't read this book fast enough. I can only hope like so many others that there will be a sequel. Though I loved this book on it's own I felt betrayed at the end as she left us hanging.If you like Robin McKinley or vampire stories this one is for you."
4,More please.,"Sunshine falls somewhere between The Southern Vampire series by Charlaine Harris and The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher. I didn't realize there was a hole there to plug, but it turns out this novel fills a void nicely. I hope there are more."
4,I hope she writes anothe book. . . .,"This book was sometimes difficult to get through because of the complexity of the sentences. I've never seen so many dashes and commas. . .it would get a little confusing at times.Despite that, I was intrigued by the community of characters and the development of Sunshine and Constantine. I feel like there is so much more to know and that there is a whole new world of possibilities with this book. I really hope she writes more because I didn't want it to end.I loved that the vampires weren't romantic and beautiful. I loved that everything wasn't always black and white, good and evil. I loved that there wasn't graphic sex, but plenty of sexual tension, adventure and an emphasis on friends and family. I really liked this book. . ."
1,i hate it,where to being... this book was so bad overall the character sunshine drove me crazy with all her whining and denial i hate weak willed people in my books. Even more then that i love a little back story but this was too much and the writing style was too much for me i guess i can truthful say that this book has made me hate first person. the people who read this book and loved it must have read a different one then me.
3,"great storyline, bad writing style","i was inspired to buy sunshine because of my previous mckinley reads. sunshine was a bit choppy and at times i felt that i was reading a second book in the series, having missed out on the first. she hopped around allot during conversations, interrupting them with sunshine's flashbacks, which i didn't care for and other times brought in topics that were not really well explained - voodoo wars, etc. i found the first three parts of the book to be fairly slow; nonetheless, the interaction of sunshine and con keeps you going. in the fourth part, just as it started to get really interesting, the book ends. it leaves you almost wishing mckinley had glossed over the never-ending days of sunshine being at the coffee shop and just got to the good stuff. maybe if she writes a second book she will get into the sunshine/con relationship further. that would have made it a better read."
3,Painful,How could this not be a good book .. here it comes. The narrator babbles (writen in first person) to the point that your looking for the quotation marks of someone actually having a conversation....ON and ON and ON ABOUT WHAT SEAMED TO ME TO BE PAINFUL NOTHINGNESS....and THEN finally she is talking to someone. PAINFULL:( This could have been such a great story...but it was almost killed by the babbeling. Will I read the next book????????? If it is like this one...I will spend a few hours skimming it. Maybe/Prob not :(
2,"Boring, Slow Read","It was okay but for me it had way too much detail. I was so confused sometimes about what sunshine was talking about or who was talking for that matter. Also, I didn't finish the book. That is very unusual for me because I always finish the book I am reading unless it is just not interesting. I would have to say this book just wasn't holding my interest. I am sure this author is awesome but this book was nothing like I expected. It was too slow and not very exciting. For a very good vampire read, try Charlaine Harris's series. Those books are awesome. I can't wait until the next one comes out."
2,"Interesting at first, but then torture to finish","I really loved the beginning of this book--the introduction to the vampires and Sunshine's special gift. But then the book got bogged down in endless repetition about making cinnamon rolls and how the main character just wanted a normal life. I got bored with Sunshine's self-pity and interior angst, which received far too much attention from the author. Storylines that were interesting to me (her father's family, her boyfriend's true nature) received scant exploration after the first 1/3 of the book. It took me three weeks to finish this book because of my boredom, but I kept slogging through, hoping it would get better. It didn't."
2,Truly disappointed by my favorite author,"I loved parts of this book - when Sunshine first uses her powers, descriptions of the members of SOF, etc. - but parts made me grind my teeth. McKinley puts her readers through pages and pages of inner-monologue-type stuff from Sunshine, and goes on about her baked goods, and generally just...goes on. Perhaps McKinley's editor is becoming a little too lenient. This book should have been about half its length, and McKinley should have spent a little less time tracing the workings of Sunshine's brain and a little more on characters that fall flat (I'm thinking of Mel and Con). I don't regret reading it, because I'll walk a mile for Robin McKinley any day, but I am praying that her next book is better!"
4,Great but enough about the cinnamon rolls already!,"I really enjoyed this book. As a long time lover of vampire ficton I found the story very original and engaging. Rae is a strong and resourceful heroine and Con (her vampire friend, lover, protector, etc.) is fascinating. My only problem with the book was, as several other reviewers mentioned, the constant, annoying, irritating, endless repetition of the fact that Rae makes cinnamon rolls. Sometimes it got so bad I wanted to throw the book across the room but the great story kept me from using it as a projectile. Looking forward to more, hopefully cinnamon roll-less, novels from Robin McKinley."
3,A unique experience...,"This book was a first for me. Normally, I would run screaming from a book with so much narrative and rambling soliloquy and so little dialogue. But this one had a good plot and the main hero and heroine were unique and interesting. Still, the author's writing style WAS a struggle. I know just a little too much about the bakery business, thank you very much. Also, I didn't care for the weirdly crass almost-sex scene between Sunshine and Connie. Whether they had sex or not, I don't care for that kind of language in a romantic setting. Barring those issues, I enjoyed it."
4,Sunshine,"Was this really a book written by Robin McKinley? It took me a few chapters to truly believe it was her. This book is so different from her others, but it was just as good. Yes, it's a vampire book. But a good one at that. These vampires aren't all beautiful nor charming. The book is about Sunshine or Rae who is abducted by vampires. Living her world this is always a danger, but only a small one where she lives. Other than vampires there are sorcerers and demons and weres. But none are feared like the merciless vampires. Sunshine finds herself shackled in that dark with no human for company. There is, however, a vampire shackled as well. with her help they both escape and he then proceeds to save her life. Now they are bound in a such a way that they must work together to defeat Bo-the one that had them both shackled. An amazing book that I highly recommend."
2,Meh,"I agree with the other reviewers in that this book rambled far too much with the heroine's inner monologue. I had to start skipping paragraphs then pages otherwise I would have stopped reading the book entirely. The plot is good, but the author does not do a good job at fleshing out the plot and there are entirely too many loose ends. I've never read any of her other books so cannot compare."
2,I love Mrs. McKinley... usually,"The idea was interesting, even though the ""Look Inside"" first pages were confusing, so I rented it from my local library. After all, how bad could it be? It was by Robin McKinley, after all. Ummm, let's just say, it wasn't worth borrowing? I couldn't really get into the book (much less, through it completely), much of Sunshine's inner monologue was babble and irritating after a while, and I don't know: I got the whole Buffy-Angel vibe, but Con was really not giving me a romantic vibe here. Just... be prepared and DO NOT judge Mrs. McKinley on this book! Try another- ANY other of her books- and you'll love them. Just hide this one.Btw: this review refers to the first edition copy of this book, hardback version. Is there much difference?"
4,Sunshine rocks,"i loved this book, it had a interesting take on the usual vampire novels. i enjoyed it alot and i would recommend it to anyonewho enjoys vampire novels."
4,Deliciously baked but not quiet done.,"I found, Sunshine, to be a wonderfully engrossing read. Even in some of it's laidback scenes you still want to keep reading. Brilliant setting and fantastic words.The one disappointment about this book for me was it's ending. It leaves you wishing there had been more to it. Maybe not exactly feeling that there should have been, but nonetheless, wishing it."
3,Unsure of what to think...,"First of all, I agree with most reviewers that this book requires a sequel (or even a series). There is so much information that leaves the reader hanging. I loved Robin's books, The Blue Sword and the Hero and the Crown, so when I saw this book it looked so promising. The problem is I found my attention wandering elsewhere at times, and the story was just not as fascinating as her past books. One minor problem I had with the book was the sexual content. Not because I'm a prude, but because I felt it was unnecessary. It felt more like Robin included it in order to make this book a ""real"" adult novel. That aside, I'll give it to you that yes, the book has a great premise and interesting ideas. The world and the lingo is fantastic, and there are many characters that have potential for a greater story. Unfortunately, it didn't have that special spark that makes me love this story. It was an enjoyable read, yes, but in the end, I'm on the fence as to whether or not I liked it."
2,One random thought after another...,"I have read other books by Robin McKinley and enjoyed them very much but her writing style does take some getting used to. So at first I thought that my frustration was that I haven't read one of her books in a while and just needed to keep reading, but this book was so random. Sunshine is an interesting concept but the author rambles on and on and on about meaningless topics that really have nothing to do with anything! I kept finding myself thinking ""what have I missed?"" Well...Nothing she is just talking about random stuff again that hasnt been explained! UGH, Frustrating!"
3,Sunshine Didn't Really Shine,"Being an avid reader, I can usually devour any book and walk away satisfied. This book was recommended to me so I bought it. Overall the plot is pretty weak, and the characters while abundant are in most cases very 2 dimensional. The writing was also choppy with disorganized thoughts, I think the editor is to blame for most of that.With that being said, I was interested enough to continue reading, however the story feels unfinished. Which would be okay if this was to be a series, from my understanding though, this is not intended to grow into a series."
2,I couldnt agree more with reviewer Tracy,"Look below for reviewer Tracy's review. I couldnt have agreed with her more. Sorry for the lack of originality but really, the book was tedious to the extreme."
3,Meh...,"I love Robin McKinley's books... but... I just couldn't get into this one. Then again, I'm not a huge vampire book fan, even before Twilight. I'm sure it's a good read for most people, but it's just not for me."
2,Possibly on of the most boring books I have finished,Oh this book was a looong drawwwwwn out durge. There is so much babble and useless detail. Robin McKinley has a wonderful fan following but she let them down on this book. The only reason that I finished this book was because I was hoping that she was going to some how make it work. My devotion to the author got in the way of my common sense. I did like the Vampire Con. But isnt it sad when your best character and the draw of your book is dead? It was as huge let down save your money and more improtantly your time
2,aggree with cmjtroy!,"What happened to Robin McKinley? Was she ""turned""?You drown in the heroine's internal thoughts, with not much happening in the action line. I floundered through it because I wanted to see what happened next, but I did find myself skipping over pages and pages of back story.Warning: Stock up on baked goods while you read this book. You'll have a closer relationship with Entemann's than you would with the heroine or her heroes!Robin, turn back! Turn back!"
3,Sunshine,"This book is about vampires, SOFs, and more vampires, with cinnamon rolls in the mix. It ends with Rae and/or Sunshine and Con beating Bo. Ahhh, how cute."
5,Great read,"I'm not a ""fantasy"" fan, but this was suggested in the ""Book Lovers Calendar"" (which I HIGHLY recommend). I found it very engaging, and the food imagery really ""sucked me in""!!! Good character development, lots of spookiness, and worth the money for the image of ""were-chickens"" alone!!"
4,"love Robin McKinley, but don't start here","Worth reading if you are a big fan, but otherwise I advise starting with one of McKinley's Beauty books or elsewhere!"
2,Eh okay,"Robin Mickinley's novel about vampire is alright at best. I have read her other workn and have been greatly impressed with them. As for Sunshine eh it was alright, i guess. The concept of vampires is interesting and I was surprised at times. Mostly the story was borring. A book about vampires, and it was borning, that's a little rough. I skimmed through page after page of useless details and never ending back story. It was interesting enough to read but only to see how everything works out at the end. But the part I was holding out for. the ending was terrible. I finished the book feeling confused and unresolved. I was simply unimpressed. If your want to get your kicks with a vampire read Dracula instead, this was just unsatisfying."
5,McKinley plus vampires is a winning combination,"I've read everything that Robin McKinley has ever published. While this wasn't my favorite of hers, I still loved it! It was definitely a departure for her, but her signature gorgeous descriptions and impeccable character development were both in evidence. I'd gladly read more about SUNSHINE and her interestingly alternate United States."
5,Love LOVE this book!!,"This is one of my all time favorite books, and one of the few that I keep around to read over and over again."
2,A little disappointed.,"The story idea was good, and could have been made into a fantastic tale. I felt a little dropped into the middle of Sunshine's world. There was very little explanation of a back story, or of the characters. Basically the book was full of holes. I kept finding myself re-reading parts thinking that I must have missed something because she just wonders off in the story. I would like to have seen a little more commitment to the relationship between Sunshine and Con. It's almost like she was toying with an idea but couldn't make up her mind how she really wanted it to go. It was basically an interesting read, but wouldn't read more than once.Sunshine"
2,Disapointing,"Another reason not to judge a book by it's cover. I was looking forward to reading this book; it has gotten glowing reviews, and it's totally my style of reading. Or so I thought. Don't get me wrong, it's not a TERRIBLE book. It's just nothing special. The plot really drags on and the author goes into a lot of pointless detail. If detail is what turns your crank, then you'll love this book. But it just didn't do it for me. I was expecting a lot more."
2,Where's the ending?!?,"A Robin McKinley fan for going on 10 years now, I have read (and own) every book she's written. I read ""Sunshine"" all in one sitting; I will admit it captures the attention. I was not totally impressed with it...it just didn't compare to previous favorites (""The Blue Sword"", etc.) My particular peeve with this book was the lack of ending...I mean, what happens? Did she and Con become romantically linked? who was Mel REALLY? where did the grandmother go? was mom partblood or what? WHAT HAPPENED?!? That ruined it for me. I like the end of a book to be all wrapped up so that I can close the book with a nice, fat, contented, sigh...not the case here."
4,great read,"I found this book to be absolutely engrossing - one of those books you stay up until 4 AM reading and are miserably tired at work the next day because you couldn't put it down. Fascinating new alternate world, with detail both 'sci-fi'ish and fantasyish. I often skip a lot of detail in books, but I found this book leaving me wanting more - more stories, more about this world Sunshine lives in. I consider that a compliment - it was a book I didn't want to put down, and kept me intrigued and thinking. Great story in the horror/vampire genre. I agree it's not for kids, but I don't agree there was too much sex; less than most books of many genres."
2,Sunshine,"I have never read a book that offered nothing but a bunch of words linked together until now. This is one of the worst vampire books. It is full of what should be interesting charaters. None of them are truly fleshed out you feel as thought you only know their names they are not 3 or 2 dimensional but 1 dimensional. This book lead nowhere. Sunshine has a lover who could or could not be a sorcerer. A father who could or could not be dead, a vampire friend who could be a good one or a bad one. After you read this book you still won't know the answers to these questions.I'm all for sequels but I do like them to be stand alone books with a complete storyline. If this book was written as a setup for a sequel what a joke. Who could care about what happens to such incomplete characters?I understand this author usually writes childrens books, that's what she need to keep on doing."
1,Ugh!,"This book was booooring. It could have been so good but McKinley spent too much time prattling on about useless information. You know that a book sucks when, after you read it, you realize that you probably really only read 1/4 of it. I scanned most of it until I got to the good parts, which were few and far between.I would not recomend this book to anyone. Ever."
2,BLAND VAMP BOOK,"I haven't eaten a muffin since I read this book. All ""sunshine "" does is makes cakes and muffins and talks about it forever. This book was a let down, in the middle it had potential but the relationship between the vamp and the heroine never really goes anywhere, there is a small teaser but it falls flat. Don't waste your time , I almost didn't finish this book."
3,If you have nothing else to read,"If you are bored with nothing else to read, you shouldn't be too disappointed if you give this book a try. The plot is fantastic, but the style/voice of the book is seriously lacking."
3,"Weak effort, whiny heroine","The book is 400 pages long and aboug 250 of them are devoted to whining and generalized angst on the part of the heroine. I am so indifferent to her fate that the last 30 pages have been sitting unread on the table for over 3 weeks. The whole book has a forced feel, without the fluid characterization and plot advancement that were the hallmarks of McKinley's earlier books. Also, if there's going to be sex (fine with me), then let there be sex. Given the large number of dangling issues amongst the side characteris and subplots still present so close to the end, I assume there is another book coming."
2,Too many questions went unanswered,"I really thought I would like Sunshine, it had so much potential. But the story was erratic with no real ending. I found it was not a satisfying read at all. I had a hard time trying to finish it because it was slow and boring. There just wasn't that much action, dialogue or even character interaction. The plot felt stagnant about 1/4 of the way through the book.It isn't worth buying and frankly it isn't worth wasting your time reading."
5,Awesome!! ;),This book is the best I have ever read in the past year. A must read! full of romance and adventure and the life of a baker.
2,"Nice premise, but way too drawn out.","I'd really love to get into this, but her writing just drags on and on getting nowhere. If you want a vampire/supernatural book series, checkout the sookie stakehouse series instead."
2,Surprisingly disappointed..,"McKinley has a gift for drawing us into her own world in a convincing and captivating way, but this book was a let down. The heroine was not strongly developed and about half-way through the book, the plot became repetitive and boring. It read like a first draft with a lot of potential.I was thoroughly disappointed and hope her next effort is better."
3,I enjoyed reading Sunshine,"I enjoyed reading Sunshine because I enjoyed the story and the plot. However, I was very frustrated with Sunshine's unwillingness to explore different aspects of the story. And, because the book was solely in her point of view, I didn't feel like all my questions were answered by the time the story ended. I enjoyed the tension between Sunshine and Constantine and kept hoping their relationship would have developed pass its ""symbiotic"" nature. I could've done without the language and the explicit scene as I didn't feel it added anything to the story. (Review by Jennifer Blaser)"
4,different and wow .,"completely unexpexted. i have definitely had trouble putting it down. not for everyone. read some reviews, come to your own conclusions and pick it up if it sounds like it appeals to you. not your average vampire/werewolf/demon book. has tons more substance and literary wit than most with similar subject mattee."
3,Not Satisfying,"The story was okay until the main characters went to confront the REALLY BAD vampire. It didn't make much sense from then on. Unless there will be a sequel, the end did not have any real closure. The only sexual scene didn't fit the rest of the story either."
4,Good but loose threads,"I liked this novel. It was a refreshing take on vampirism, largely uninfluenced by White Wolf and Ms. Rice. The main character is compelling; a young woman who is no Mary Jane, but does her best to make it through life. She's happy as a baker at a bohemian cafe in a post-magical-apocalyptic American city. But her parents' mysterious pasts intrude on her life.With that said, it loses a star for leaving plot threads ""hanging"" without a sequel intended. Part of that is just Robin McKinley's way; as an author, she loves characters and dialog, but puts plots in mostly as an excuse to give those characters something to do and talk about."
2,Not for those who want explanation or closure,"Everything is left hanging at the end. The book is divided into four parts, but for no apparent reason. The characters are introduced and wash away. I kept waiting for something to happen and was so unsatisfied at the conclusion."
3,So Disappointed,After the reviews I had such high hopes for this book. I found myself skimming many pages at a time to get to the coherent parts of the story. The story itself is great! The author uses too many unrelated words & goes of topic a great deal. Potential for a great book if it had fewer pages of boring details.
2,Burdened with excessive inner monologue,"I really wanted to like this book. The storyline was interesting and the character development was fine. I didn't even have a problem with the first person narrative as some readers do. The problem I do have is the rambling inner monologue that is simply never ending! I am halfway through the book and am now so frustrated by the monologue that I just can't bring myself to finish reading it.Also, the author's use of analogies and similies is all over the map and mostly nonsensical. I spent so much time attempting to figure out the point she was trying to make. After a while I realized that my mind started wandering while I was reading the endless monologues so I figured there was no point in reading any further.Sadly, this book had promise but I will not be coming back for seconds."
2,BUYER BEWARE!!!!,"This cd ""Fix it Jesus"" is not the cd I thought it to be. If you are thinking that this is by Phil Perry the great R&B;,jazz singer. This is not the same vocalist.There is no picture of the cd. Don't be fooled like I was and purchase this thinking your buying Phil Perry the famous singer.That being said,I would not recommend this cd. I enjoy gospel music as much as any other form. This cd however,did not touch my spirit. It was ok, but for me that is about all I can say.Everyone has their own ears. You may like this one. I would suggest you try to find a way to listen to it first,before you spend $13.00 on this one"
3,Nice looking but functions could be better,"I bought this sport watch for use on recreational bike rides. It looks great and is easy to read. However the long crown is uncomfortable and unwinds by itself. The band, although nice looking, is very stiff at first but does soften with time. Overall very good looking but may not be worth the price."
3,Come on Man,"Reno 911 needs more Terry! This show is great, but some things get tired quickly. They need to bring it back for one more season and make it more epic than before."
5,Keeps Getting Funnier,"A gay taco server on skates,a knight stuck in a porta-pottie,a KKK member with a black boo,a naked pregnant woman jumping(or trying to) from a cake,and a gay civil union in kilts are just a few of the hilarious situations in this box set.The 4th season is as funny or often funnier than the other season's through to the cliff hanger ending. Highly recommended."
3,Alright,The dvd is alright if you like the show. Nothing truly groundbreaking or very exciting. The Reno 911 movie was pretty funny maybe save your money for something else that you want.
2,"This is not new material, it's a re-release from 1990","For those of you who are buying this album, please keep in mind that this album is actually 10 years old!! This was Marc Anthony's first English CD that he recorded in 1990 as a ""freestyle"" performer. Many people think last year's release was his first English album, but it's not. The best cuts on this album are the title track and the power ballad ""Walk Away."" Tito Puente and India also appear on this CD."
2,Could have been better.,"If it says ""MarcAnthony"" I own it! It could have and should have been better. 1 or 2 were truly ""club type"" material that really makes you move. The others were just OK. If you haven't purchased it yet- you haven't missed out."
1,when the night is over by marc anthnony and little louievega,I could not here the album samlpe cause the program said it was to busy so i hope i could here a sample of it cause little louie vega was and is one of the best dj's if not the best dj that live's and marc anthony is the best salsa singers that we have today in the industrie of salsa music. So please do some thing about the listening sample problem so i can hear it and then review it.Thanks for listing and i hope to hear it soon.Yours truly bronxboy_20001@webtv.net
3,Not Bad...,"Pretty good, but could have used more descriptive language. I know that considering the subject matter you shouldn't expect it NOT to contain some ""dirty words"". That being said, I felt that it lacked the description necessary in several instances by not using more descriptive or colorful wording when it gets right down to the juicy bits. Just a thought, but overall this book was still pretty entertaining and for the price wasn't a bad purchase at all."
3,"An enjoyable, and exciting away team mission","The Enterprise is sent on a mission to discover what is behind the attacks on a federation colony by Klingons on a distant planet which is in a de-facto neutral zone between the Klingon and Romulan empires. Once there the Away team discovers a Klingon prisoner who has been beaten and starved, and is only a young teenager. Further invistigation uncovers several mysteries and dangers.While I did find the story to be a good one, and espically enjoyed the action and suspense, there were several technical and logical errors on the part of some of the crew. Dianna's abilities were far less than what they should have been(inability to sense deception) and the Enterprises sensors should have been able to play a better part here and make it possible to solve this issue much quicker."
3,"Good overview, but light on the actual details","Phillips provides a good, general overview of the metrics to consider in evaluating the return on consulting engagements. However, the book could have been significantly improved by the addition of at least one complete example of an application of the suggested method for calculating ROI, including a more in-depth treatment of the many survey methods suggested. Further, some of the snippets of the quantitative examples are simplified to the point of being misleading. Finally, the concept of the scorecard, which was part of the title of the book, was not developed in the text."
2,"Nice words, uninspiring pictures...","I should have read the other reviews--I was expecting beautiful full-color pictures like the cover art. Since the same illustrator actually did the cover, it seems like a very unfortunate editorial decision to not create a full color picture book! When I first received ""The Tree of Life"", I actually thought there had been some sort of printing error. The unfortunate blue-purple color reminds me of old mimeograph sheets. I chose a picture book rather than a text because I wanted inspiring art, and this just doesn't do it. Unfortunately, the sample doesn't show enough of the book to realize how monotonous (both figuratively and literally) the pages actually are."
2,Disappointing,"I really want a book to introduce the concept of evolution to elementary age children. This book has so many frustrating properties that I'm probably going to return it. The very first page was a problem. ""In the beginning days of the Earth, all was silence."" So we run into the philosophical discussion of if a tree falls in the forest and no one was there to hear it, does it make a sound? I think so. I really doubt the beginning was silent and the next page in the book contradicts the silence. The illustration to go with this shows earth in roughly its presently land formation, which of course is inappropriate for ""the beginning"". On top of that all of the pictures are black and white. The text sounds like a revised creation myth instead of science. I'm seriously disappointed and if I can find a different book that does a better job, I'm returning this one. Even if the text had been better, this should have been a $6-8 book."
3,The book is ok...,"The Tree of Life: The Wonders of Evolution is a nice book in the sense that it provides a tool to explain evolution to youth. Unfortunately all the pictures are blue--very similar to watercolor paintings only in blue. In addition the text can be a little off at times and could be a little confusing to younger kids. Overall it's nice to have a book to describe evolution to children in a much more comprehendable manner, but it isn't a book that will ""wow"" you."
5,WOW!!,"I absolutley love Atomic Kitten and they are my 3rd favorite group to listen to right after S Club & A*teens. I also love Vitamin CThis album rocks1. Whole Again 8/10- Very good, never gets boring2. Ladies Night 4/10- Repetative and tired3. The Tide Is High 7/10- Very catchy and plain fun4. It's OK! 10/10- One of the best on the album5.

1,You Definetly Need To Skip This At All Costs,"This is the cheesiest pop music I have ever heard in my life. I can't believe this is what folks listen to in England. Back in the day there were a lot of good pop acts coming from England, and now I just don't know what's going on. Shoot, the Spice Girls were way better than this. At least they had some catchy songs. But this? Atomic Kitten? Sorry, but I'm not feeling these so-called greatest hits. Everything was boring and lame. The remakes of ""Ladies Night"" and ""Eternal Flame"" were just watered down. Anyway, Amazon is selling used copies of this CD for $9.09. Well, for $9.09 I could buy teriyaki beef jerky and some corn nuts. This CD sucks and that's the bottom line. Hoolllaaa!"
1,what is a memory?,this book is so wierd. it talks about this crazy woman that lost her mind to much. the people kiss to much also. why do they have to kiss? it's so disguting. well i g2g. one more thing i love icebreakers! but you know what i hate when you eat popcorn and the kournels get stuck in your teeth! if brian is reading this i'm the girl at the movies the day after thanksgiving in the movie christmas with the kranks!
5,A satisfying conclusion to the series,"The final book of the trilogy, ""House at Sunset,"" is a bit different from the previous two books, but is still a very rewarding read. The stories are still historical fiction, but the characters tend to be a little different, and sometimes a little more villainous than the characters in the previous two books. Nonetheless, the stories are very interesting, and the book comes to a satisfying ending. Very good read all around."
4,Great alternative to secular music for pre-teens,"As a mom of pre-teen girls, I was thrilled when my 8 year old found ZOEgirl and wanted more. I bought it without glancing at the price and she has listened to it non-stop since the purchase. It might not be the type of music for everyone, but for a christian family, I would much rather her willingly listen to a group with the Lord has their focus, rather than boys, sexy clothing or defying authority! (And even though I am NOT a pre-teen, I love ZOEgirl too!)"
4,This is a good CD!,"Hey I really like ZOEgirl. I especially like Stop right there,and Anything is Possible. Ya'll really need to get this CD!"
2,There is much better Christian music ....,"So much better out there. Especially of this particular ""modern"" style the editorial speaks of. Try, for instance, Rachel Lampa, or Aurora.Maybe I just don't like girl bands as much as I don't like boy bands (I prefer 1 person to sing pop and/or r&b instead of a group).Technically thats what this is: a modern girlband. Less hip/hop and more of a light bubblegum pop. A toned down , Christian ""backstreet girls"".I don't like it, if this is your style - go for it. (For some reason, Aurora makes the ""group"" work, if you like more than 1 singing at a time, try them.)"
2,Could Use More Vocabulary Words,"My wife is Swiss-German, and I've learned plenty of Swiss-German words over the years. While I appreciated the effort, learning how to order two beers over several lessons didn't quite work for me. Since there are so few Swiss-German language resources available, this CD series is better than nothing, but I would have like to have learned more than saying I am from America and would like to order ""gschnatzlets mit rosit"" and a beer."
2,Good but not nearly enough,"This book is a great introduction for those who have some German language exposure already. However, for those who want to actually make progress in speaking in conversation beyond the usual, ""I live in Zurich"" and ""I'm doing well,"" go with something like the video course called ""Der Schweizermacher"" or the few Swiss German movies out there.On the other hand, this is a good introduction to some of the most basic structures. Very, very basic, but still a good intro."
3,Swiss German is not your high school German,"Like my most Americans, I assumed the German spoken in Switzerland was pretty much the same as my high school and college German. Not so. I have run through the offered lessons once and am going back to the first lesson to improve my grasp of this language.The program is easy and well done. The ONLY shortcoming is there are only ten lessons. It gets you through all the basics and a fairly large vocabulary. You will be able to introduce yourself, get a meal, lodging and find directions and understand the answers. Don't look for much more beyond the basics. A pity but there are really alternatives without moving to Switzerland as the language is a spoken only language."
1,Not Focused,"This movie seems to be the rough draft to a better movie. The premise is good, the acting was ok but the script has so many holes in it it's unbelievable. Sebastian is dull void of character. In fact all the characters in this script are superficial and dull. Adrian is a good actor but why does he choose such dull scripts."
3,Not what I expected,"From reading the box I really thought this was going to be a movie about a teen-ager coming to terms with his transsexual stepdad. But miraculously the stepdad's gender was not the punchline, the way gayness was in Twilight of the Golds and a million other coming out movies.It was fun to watch the now-stepmom deal with his discovery of how women are treated. She really worked it and was fast on her feet, but she really wasn't the story.Anyway, this movie was about a kid with a life and how he did his best to cope with about the upheaval adults brought to it.Adrian Grenier as Sebastian Cole was beautiful and a good actor. The story and feel of the movie was very '80s, which was fun.They really nailed what the cast of characters is like in high school, particularly Sebastian's loser friends. And they nailed the kind of stupid stuff you do in high school and hope your parents don't discover.Worth a look for sure."
4,pretty good,"i kept seeing previews for this movie and it looked like something i would really like. so i got it off amazon and it's pretty good. classic movie moments, a lot of adventuring but it seems incomplete. what ev. it's worth the money cause i'm gonna wanna watch it again. doo it."
5,amazing,"i love this film. i remember watching the trailer years and years ago, and constantly having it on my brain. its kind of hard to come by, so im thrilled that amazon has it. i recommend this to anyone who enjoys a film that leaves you thinking and with a feeling of empowerment and knowledge."
5,This Game Is The BOMB!,"This game has a very exciting felling to it. when playing hot pursuit(where you chase robbers or get chased by the cops), you get the feeling of the high speed chase. There are 7 to 15 levels available. Im not sure about that.This ia a very good choice if you have kids from 9 to 15. I bought this game for about the same as amazon is selling it."
3,The best night and weather racing ever,"NFS 3 is a game which is good for the first month, Ok for the second but starts to get a bit boring after the third. The reason I would keep playing it though is the superb graphics and the option to let you download cars off the 'net and put them in the game. Also if you are lucky enough to find a working track editor (most of them don't work!)then you can have fun designing new tracks. Another utility is ViV Wiz which allows you to edit the cars dash colour and performance. In all i think the game could have been better with better AI and better track layouts. But apart from those few things NFS3 is a game to buy if you liked the first two in the NFS series."
4,"Fun game, but unrealistic","This game is extremely fun, but also very unrealistic. The handling does not resemble real life the least bit. Also, the graphics are not smooth and not rounded (especially the smoke-it has no round outlines, only cube outlines like it is a close-up of a video game picture). The final flaw I find with this game is that they included low-performance cars, such as the Jaguar XK8, the Mercedes SL600, and the Aston Martin DB7. The game would be better if they included Lotus, McLaren, or the Viper. However the addictiveness and fun of the game somewhat make up for these flaws."
1,dull game,i love need for speed 2. i bought need for speed 3 and i was bored out of my mind. this game has the worst cars and tracks. what a waste of money. well i aways play need for speed 2 so it's all good.
1,Still a need for seed,"This could have been soooo much beter. You feel like you are going 2mph when your racing. The peruit mode sucks and the grafics look like the game was made in 1880. My advice is to get Test Drive 6 or midtown maddness, this stinks."
5,The best driving sim out there.,"I've played them all, and NFS3 is the best racing game out there. Each car is individual in it's handling, rather than the cookie cutter style of other games. And, with the ability to download and create your own cars...the posibilities are endless. I've had the game for a year, and I have over 80 cars...I still play the game almost every day!"
1,not as expected,"Thought it was a box set of music, turns out all it is is interviews...did not want interviews. Do not buy this product if you are looking for music."
5,Western Digital 500GB Elements External Hard Drive,Excellent product. Plugged into USB and started using. Totally reliable for first 2 months. Amazon is a winner.
4,WD 500gb external hard drive,"I needed something to backup my files, mostly pictures and music. So I bought this external drive. Easy to hook up, on and off switch so I can just leave hooked up and use when needed. I have had for about 3 months and have backed up a few times with out any problems, not as fast as my internal hard drives, but adequate speed."
2,"Nice design, poor quality","After about 4 mos. as my Time Machine drive it died. Lost all my backup and the drive will not mount and Disk Utility cant format it.The WD warranty is one year, but I am out the shipping cost to return it, plus my backup.The drive enclosure is fine, the rubber endcaps are nice. On/Off switch and low noise are great. Runs a tad hot, but the activity light has a pleasant glow.Overall, I like the drive, especially for the price. I just won't give it more than 2 stars since it failed in such a short amount of time."
3,Less than a year and ...,"the power supply died. It has an unusual plug on it, so I couldn't get a replacement (even from Western Digital). On the plus side, they did replace the entire drive at no cost and upgraded it to different drive. I will say their telephone support was not good (someone in India), but the email support was outstanding after someone responded. So all in all, I'd say you might want to consider a drive with a more universal type of power supply, in case you need to replace it. The drive was fine (I know because I have 2 and swapped out the power supplies when it died), but not being able to replace something as simple as a power supply is a definite flaw in the design."
1,Obsolete adaptor,"Not only does this run warm..but after I had this for 1 year---(but in all I only used it for about 1 MONTH)--the adaptor went. At least i hope it's that. I am waiting to get it in the mail---which you can ONLY order through WD Elements. No other pc stores, radio shack, etc...even carry a power pack with this cord. And, after writing and telling them I saw all the reviews and chat rooms on how this adaptor is defective, I still had to pay for it.On top of it all--the guy on the phone was trying to sell me another external to back up my external!? REALLY? i told him I would never buy from WD Elements again and the guy laughed!Buyer beware!!!!!!"
3,comes with AC adaptor a bit noisy,"The technical info didn't specify whether this came with a power adaptor - it does. I found it noisier than the freecom external harddrive that I have and it's a bit slower at copying files over, but works fine. It's just a pain to have to find a power socket rather than being powered through USB"
5,Good for me,"Works fine, the price is very good for the capacity. It's a real plug & play. I didn't detect any noise, the unit is very quiet."
1,AC adapter gave out,"I have been using this product for 10 months. I used it one day and then two days later I plug it in and the AC adapter would no longer light up green thus I couldn't access my 300+ GB of information that I have stored on it. I have so many pictures, music and school information from my undergrad and graduate studies. I should NOT have to buy a backup for my backup. Ridiculous. It seems this is a common problem for this product as there are reviews all over the internet about the same problem. I will try to call WD (despite the other reviews on here) or try to by a generic AC adapter. In the future, I would not recommend WD - avoid!"
1,Western Digital 500GB Elements External,"Purchased: Oct 29, 2008.Delivered: Nov 05, 2008Dead as a doornail: 13 Jun 2009No warning, no nothing, just dead.Warranty (worthless), yea right, if they spoke English, I might have been able to return it. Useless customer service!I would never purchase this POS again or anything by Western Digital. Another customer lost!"
1,Poor customer support,"The WD 500 GB external hard drive worked fine until the 1 year warranty was about to expire. WD's customer service dept. leaves a lot to be desired. Not only do they barley speak understandable English, they never follow through as they promised on the phone. I FAX'd data twice and never had a response. BEWARE DON'T BUY ITEMS FROM WD. THEY DON'T STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS"
1,Failed after about 9 months,The disk worked well for 9 months and then it was not longer found by the PC. It was a total failure (unable to retrieve any data). I would not recommend this Hard drive.
1,Don't waste your money,There should be a class action lawsuit against WD for their faulty power supplies. Mine went out last week after less than 2 years of service. I have done a little research and it seems that many users are experiencing faulty power supplies.
2,Good until the end,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book until the last little bit. Having the main character be sent home so quickly was unrealistic, having Ted suddenly decide to become a music therapist was not transitioned smoothly and probably unrealistic, I didn't care for the late addition of new characters (nurses), one of whom just happens to sing and the cliffhanger with no warning was frustrating - I felt like it was just a ploy to get us to buy the next book. I would have liked to see more development of Alex's conversion and subsequent learning to live as a Christian. The fight between Alex and Ted to see who would get to make the ""unchristian"" nurse mad because they had permission to play the music was unchristian of them both. I felt frustrated because I did enjoy most of the book, but am not sure I'll buy the sequel."
3,Life Support... that's what I need after reading this book!,"I am SHOCKED by the ending of this book. I've seen cliffhangers, I've seen abrupt endings, I've seen poor endings... but THIS... this takes the cake. WHERE IS THE RESOLUTION?!?!?I LOVED this book up until the last page. As a matter of fact, part of what kept the pages quickly turning towards the conclusion of the book was wondering how in the world Whitlow was going to tie up all these loose ends.And you know what? If ""Life Everlasting"" is going to be the sequel that ties up these questions, I can live with that. But at least say that. At least say, at the end of the book, ""learn what happens to So&So in 'Life Everlasting!'"" As it is now, I have no idea if Robert Whitlow is planning to wrap it up or not. I really hope so.Reading this book would be like seeing ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" -- if you didn't know that a third movie had already been filmed and was only 6 months away.*grr*"
2,Disappointing,"I rarely write reviews but this book left me shaking my head. I enjoyed the initial set up with Rena and her husband. The romantic/spiritual subplot seemed contrived and disconnected to the basic plot, until the end of course when the God guy saves the day...with a couple of 30 minute sessions.I was hoping that Alex would begin to sense something was wrong and she would be forced to reevaluate her biases. But no luck.As I approached the final 10 pages of the book, with no twist in sight, I began to smell an overly simplistic, rushed conclusion...and that's what I got. Oh well. I did enjoy The List."
2,Too manipulative for me,"Rena's plan to achieve security by killing her rich young husband Baxter is foiled by his survival, even though he is comatose. So she tries to win lawyer Alex to her side in the fight to pull the plug on Baxter and make her a rich widow.I barely made it halfway through this book before giving up. Although Whitlow tries to make Rena a sympathetic character by exposing her life as an abused child, she still comes across as a self-obsessed manipulator. Her determination to kill Baxter off was intolerable, and her ability to exploit Alex's assumption that the woman is always the innocent victim showed how even a brilliant woman can be stupid. I simply didn't want to read any more."
3,Good Story - But took two books to tell it.,"Let me say first that I like Robert Whitlow a lot. Jimmy is one the best books I've read in a long while. This was an excellent story with insight to the legal world and the complexities of the attorney-clent privilege. But, this could have easily been told in one book. Life Support cannot stand on its own without Life Everlasting and vice-versa. Sequels are great but only when the story can't be told in one novel."
3,Cannot really rate,"As an estate planning attorney, one who has dealt with numerous powers of attorneys' and bickering families, I found this book hard to read. I don't know if it was my personal experiences or merely the author's writing style, but I found this book less than realistic. The characters seemed stereotypical and contrived. The dialogue was messy and unbelievable."
5,Abusir,"A must volumn to have in any Egyptology collection, Informative, authorative in an easy reading format. Keeps on current in an area of new developments."
4,Jimmy Smith & Grant Green together,"This album combines the mastery of Jimmy Smith and Grant Green. In fact, this is the only album we have with that combination. With Donald Bailey on drums, we have a very sophisticated trio.The trio settings are very enjoyable: very funky, relaxed, and elegant at the same time. The album is not as intricate and delicate as the later Grant Green trios with Larry Young and Elvin Jones, though."
3,Not an original.,"Even though there's a notice on the Amazon page telling you that this is a copy of the original, I only noticed that after I'd placed my order. Now, although I can't possibly fault the quality of the copy which must have been made with very high quality equipment, it still isn't worth the price tag. Because I could easily get a second hand original on Amazon for the same price. The quality of the cover art and CD label printing easily and quickly give this away as a hand made copy, even if I really can't find anything wrong with the sound quality."
1,Very disappointing,Not James Taylor and not the best songs and it was very hard to tell what would be on it from the way it was advertised. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
3,No CDG Words,"I'd say the background music on this James Taylor Karaoke CD is great, but there is a big problem, there are no words for viewing by plugging the yellow wire into a TV or Monitor,"
3,Good for children,I purchased this expecting a full biography. It is a quick synopsis of Golda's life. It would be good for an overview for children.
4,J'ai vraiment aimé!!!,"J'ai été voir Kery James lors de son passage à Québec, et j'ai tomber réellement en amour. Je veux dire que ce genre de musique dans la langue franaise, je n'apprécie pas du tout d'habitude mais KJ est un des meilleurs que j'aie vu!Alors courez chercher ce cd c'est vraiment de la bombe!Mary"
3,Not what the title would suggest...,"...in that I think of ancient Phoenicia, while in fact this plays in only in the main character's background. Essentially a victorian romantic novel, ala Sir Walter Scott, this instead chronicles several generations of English history through the eyes of the eponymous hero. The story is somewhat convoluted, with unresolved threads and underdeveloped characters. Nevertheless, there are portions that are real gems--and the illustrations alone are almost worth the price of the book."
3,The Only Guide to This Region,"Being the only guidebook to West Papua/Irian Jaya alone is a major merit of it. It also has well-researched background information and decent practical details on the major tourist attractions of this area.However, ONLY the major tourist attractions (Jayapura/Baliem/Biak/Manokwari/Asmat) are covered in any detail, and even many of those descriptions are simply accounts of the author's own travels there, which seem to have taken place many, many years ago.There is no description of plenty of other, relatively accessible and increasingly popular parts of Papua, some of which are actually covered in the Rough Guide to Indonesia.But with coverage of this region in general guidebooks to Indonesia invariably limited in length, this book is certainly still worth buying by anyone who wants to spend more than just a week there."
5,Review for Tales from India,This book was in great shape for being used. In our business we appreciate the good quality we receive at a low cost.
1,Waste of Money,"This does not charge the Sandisk Sansa I ordered it for at all! I haved tried and tried to charge the battery it came with, now I have to just buy another battery! Wasted my money!"
4,Lyrical but grueling,"There is no doubt that many parts of this novel are beautifully written; I will be reading parts to my AP English students.But it is not a book for the squeamish or for those who don't want to confront the reality of war. As I was reading it, I kept thinking of the ""Johnny, We Hardly Knew 'ye"" ballad, which, as I tell my Irish friends, has to be the most gruesome and depressing song ever composed.This is a thoughtful novel meant for serious reflection."
5,Language as food,"This books tells a great story, but the lyrical quality of the writing is enough that I would read Mr. Barry's accounting of actuarial tables. These words will feed your soul."
3,Well written but yikes...!,"So many reviewers seem to say this is Sebastian Barry's best work. I would *highly* recommend the Secret Scripture over this. This is just too much a slog in the WWI bog of bodies, death and destruction. This has an interesting side to it, having never gotten the Irish perspective on WWI but beyond that, ouch. Too long and depressing. Read All quiet on the western front? Then you've got 75% of this book."
5,Beautifully written,The words are so well written and contain candor and horror. Loved the book and highly recommend.
3,"A typically horrible, sad, beautiful Irish story","3.5 starsI loved this story at first. It is beautifully written and Willie Dunne is a likable character. Also, I really liked the premise: an Irishman goes to war for Britain only to have his own country become a war zone while he's in Flanders protecting the empire. I anticipated a great moral dilemma for Willie.However, about halfway through I became worn out with the horrors of WWI. I wanted something more to happen to move the plot forward other than Willie's comrades being blown to bits. I kept hoping he'd go home and we'd get to see how Ireland on the brink of independence from Britain treated her sons who had fought for Britain. That this did not happen disappointed me."
1,Ireland's WWI Novel,"I agree with the comments about prose rising occassionally to the level of poetry. I won't say more about that. What impressed me is the sustained elegance and tension in depicting the conflict between those Irishmen wanting to serve in the war, as loyal subjects to the crown, and those whose anti-English passions were aroused by the Easter 1916 rebellion. In short, this book is Ireland's great WWI novel. I can't imagine it's being outdone. I expect it will be around for a long long time."
2,Full Screen Version,"I personally like Widescreen DVDs for my large tv. This Full Screen Version is not marked on the front cover that it is Full Screen, my fault i'm disappointed, their fault it is not clearly marked."
5,highly recommended!,"This cd single is terrific, featuring the should be classic (if radio ever gets the clue) ""through the rain"" written by Mariah Carey. It is a traditional ballad on getting on with and through things. There can never be enough songs like this in the world, let alone writers who can pen them. Mariah does not get the credit she should for her songwriting, perhaps because she is so diverse. She can write songs that appeal to the hip-hop crowd and then turnaround and write classics or should be classics lke ""Hero"", 'Anytime You Need A Friend"", ""Lead The Way"",""Butterfly"", ""After Tonight"", and ""I Only Wanted"" (from the very recommended recent Charmbracelet).The ""TTR"" remix here is, in my opinion, worlds better than the one on the album - you can dance to it and it is ALL Mariah (no guest stars). Finally, the live ""Bringin' on the Heartbreak"" rounds things out nicely. If you own ""Charmbracelet"" I would still recommend getting this because the remix...... ROCKS!!!!."
3,Through The End,"A last ditch attempt at bringing some life to the debt single off Charmbracelet? Maybe so. Appended to this single are the album version of the song, a club remix and a live remake of Def Leppard's Bringing On The Heartbreak.Not terribly interesting. Through The Rain is just another demonstration of Mariah's vocal powress and tried-and-tested hand at formulaic balladry. The Hex Hector/MacQuayle Radio Edit may speed things up a bit but still sounds a tad tired. Certainly not one of their best remixes. The live version of Bringing on The Heartbreak actually sounds better than the album version."
2,Disappointed...,"This is not one of her best CD singles. Reason? Well, generally Mariah re-records all her remixes, and the Hex Hector/Quayle remix of TTR is just a background covering her voice. It sounds very ""cheesy"", unlike her previous club remixes, such as ""My All"", ""Always Be My Baby"", and Heartbreaker"". The third track is a live version of ""Brigin' On the Heartbreak"". ...but what would have really been worth the money is some good remixes of a maxi single of TTR like her previous singles in the past. Hopefully her newest single, Boy (I Need You) will have some quality remixes. I don't really care for the song, because she has recorded better material, but who knows; we may be surprised...."
4,The first ''Guilty''-by Joel,"I think you can easily understand that Blue for their song ''Guilty'' have copied the masters of the boybands,Take That.And this sweet song,like the first one,of course is better."
3,I hope there's better out there,"I am reading Ulysses for the first time, and, yes, this book helps tremendously in understanding Ulysses. I'd be lost without it much of the time. BUT it's not a wonderful book. Gilbert quotes extensively from Ulysses -- for those people who don't actually want to read Ulysses, he says in the intro. -- but doesn't bother to translate quotes that are in French or Latin or Greek. The quotes from Ulysses often aren't introduced or explained well -- there just there. In fact, most quotes, from Joyce or from other sources, aren't well explained -- some chapters seem to have none of his own words, just quote after quote -- and because of that, I certainly wouldn't call this book a ""good"" text. Certainly, it is useful, and I don't regret the time spent reading it, but I am sure that there are more-accessible studies out there."
4,Works if given a chance,"Four stars, not five, if only because I do agree somewhat that this study can be as complex as the novel itself. I think that the reason for this is that Joyce's work is, indeed, so rich and allusory that a full-length treatment like this is demanded. Ulysses is to the novel what Jorge Borges's short stories are to that literary art form.By the way, 12 years ago I took a college course on Joyce and spent seven weeks of the twelve-week semester on Ulysses alone. Believe me, that wasn't nearly enough time. Yet, the presense of a knowledgeable mentor was invaluable in understanding this wonderful novel.Stuart is the next best thing to having such a person nearby, but be forewarned--you will still need all of your analytical skills. Ulysses is a complete education, and as such entails a lifetime journey."
5,Joyce rued this collaboration.,"According to Richard Ellman's Joyce biography Joyce felt that the book by Gilbert was an ""advertisement for Ulysses,"" and he rued the collaboration. Perhaps this shows how clear the book renders Ulysses, but it also shows that Ulysses is better read without consulting second texts so that it echoes in the unconscious as oppossed to being deciphered and merely understood."
2,very happy with Stuart Gilbert 's book!,"This book has been very useful to understand James Joyce masterpiece, ""Ulysses"":the main interest of the book is a very thorough analysis of Joyce style, and detailed explanations about the connections of the novel with the last studies about the ""Ulysses"" of Homer."
2,Not the actual novel,"I bought this thinking it was the actual novel, not a study. Admittedly, simple ignorance that I did not read the description more thoroughly, but still I am not happy that the Amazon title at the top of the page says ""James Joyce's Ulysses"" without a mention that it is ""A Study by Stuart Gilbert."""
2,Not The Best...,"The first two episodes on this DVD are obnoxious! My kids don't mind it mostly because it's new to them, but as an adult, it is just horrible! I think the worst thing to happen to Spongebob is when Stephen Hillenburg sold his rights to the cartoon. I was pretty disappointed with this DVD. I agree wholy with the first reviewer's opinion: the ""Road Song"" is the most annoying song in Spongebob's history - and there are some annoying ones. I would skip this DVD altogether and just download any episodes you might like instead."
1,spongebob going downhill,"The runaway roadtrip episode was horrible. That ""rode song"" was just so awful that I felt like punching myself when I was listening to it. That episode is by far one of the worst episodes in the whole series. Hide and Then what Happens was not as bad, but it was no good at all. Shellback Shenanigans was OK, but it was certainly not great like the old episodes. Spongebob used to be one of my favorite shows but now it is probably one of the worst kids shows that is still running."
1,"The work fine, but break after just a couple uses","I have received two Cooper Coolers as gifts. The first stopped pumping water after a few uses. Then my friend bought me a replacement for Christmas. That one broke on the third use. Now it just makes a faint humming noise. I contacted the Cooper Cooler folks and they said my unit was out of warranty, and offered to sell me another one at a discount. Needless to say, I passed on their offer.Cooper Coolers work fine, but the quality of these devices is just HORRIBLE. I would stick to a traditional ice-chest."
1,Quit Second Day,"Cooper Cooler HC01-A Rapid Beverage Chiller, White and GreyWOrked great--for one day. Motor does not work at ALL; contrary to the description, small bottles (i.e. 16 oz) do not fit. Altogether one of the few disappointing things I have ordered from Amazon."
2,Great until the motor smoked,I bought one for my husband for Christmas 2006. We only used it occasionally. It worked great until March of 2007. The motor smoked and then just quit.
5,A Nifty Gadget,"I had this product a few weeks before using it. Now that I have, I'll be using it more often. It works as described and works well. I've only used it with cans so far, but will be trying it with bottles also. You'll like this gadget!"
5,This thing is GREAT,"I got the cooper cooler for my father for Christmas and we tried it out that evening. The cooler is amazing and made our wine super chilled in about 5 minutes, instead of having to put it in the freezer and forgetting about it, later drinking a wine slushy! I would recommend this product to wine lovers, and anyone in general who doesn't tons of fridge space for wine, soda, et. Buy it!"
4,No More Warm Soda,"If there is anything I hate as much as Warm Soda, it is Soda that has been watered down by trying to chill it by pouring Warm Soda over Ice.The Rapid Beverage Chiller makes all that as old school as watching TV without TiVo.In just about 1 minute, that warm can of soda is chilled and ready to drink.Thanks for the great birthday gift, Pop!"
5,"Quality product that works as described, quite refreshing!","The item works as described. It is made of quality plastic, not the latest cheapo plastic that breaks when you look at it. Item is a bit noisy, but what do you expect for something that is using simple technology to quickly cool your beverage of choice. Simple and easy to use and maintain. Bravo Cooper Cooler."
5,Rapid Beverage Chiller Review,Great item .... does what it says it does. No need to keep a fridge full of soda or wine anymore. Just chill as needed.
4,Low tech product. Disappointed.,"I wish this didn't require the user to load in ice first. I wouldn't have bought it had I known that. My husband got home the other night with some beer that needed to be cooled. We went to the icemaker in the freezer and didn't have enough. This product requires two trays of ice cubes. I was expecting something that we could plug in that would have a cooling element of some nature. All this does is spin the bottle over ice. Then, you have to clean it up when it is done and dry it out. What a pain. It is very clunky when spinning a bottle of wine too. Makes a lot of noise. Personally, I thought the price was a bit high considering it's simplicity.I gave it four stars as it does work well. For those not concerned with having to have a couple trays of ice on hand and cleaning it out after it is done, you will be fine."
5,No more exploding soda!,"Gave this to my husband who constantly put soda in the freezer, forgot it, and viola exploded soda everywhere! We have been using it constantly. We frequently have large numbers of thirsty teenagers here, and this will chill 12 cans on the initial 2 trays of ice cubes. Though it claims extra time will make a soda nearly freezing cold, it doesn't quite get that cold, but it's definitely refrigerator cold. Have also chilled 20 oz bottles of ice tea, which also are nice and cold. Have not yet tried wine (but we drink mostly red and wouldn't chill that anyway). My neice is getting married and this is a perfect gift for her and her fiance!"
2,Quit after limited use,"The cooler smoked and quit after maybe fifty uses. When it worked, it performed well. But at a cost of $1 per bottle of wine or beer cooled, it was hardly a bargain."
5,As Advertised!,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and he had all sorts of fun cooling all sorts of beverages for the rest of the day. Now he won't let me put my white wine in the fridge to chill, lest I deprive him of his technological fun.The cooler does what it promised to do!"
1,"Not Enough Letters, Too Many Pictures","This book is mainly a photography book. There are pages after pages of lettering of ""vernacular"" typography. Interspersed are a few pages of hand-drawn lettering by the author. We're talking about 8-10 pages total of typography by Ed Fella himself. I would have preferred to see more of the author's own work with fewer photographic references."
3,Cute but...,"This shoe looks really good, but is quite uncomfortable. It would be nice if amazon would list the heel height of all of their shoes. This shoe is of good quality though."
3,"Not Bad 2 Out Of 3 Time Wasters, At A Good Price Too","Worth buying for Within The Rock alone as that feature is the best on offer here, A crew on an asteroid (they are there to drill deep enough to blow it up to save earth, yes that old line again) encounter a nasty alien creature.Fear is about a Halloween party that goes wrong with the guests being slain, not a bad effort for what it is.Opera was pretty boring, almost putting me to sleep.So Within The Rock and Fear are not bad for the price of this set."
2,"Should be called ""Manipulating your man God's way.""","I did this book with a small group, and while many deny they are trying to change their man, their actions say they are. If women tried this hard to change themselves, their marriages would undoubtedly be better. The priciples are biblical and sound, and I do believe the premise of the book wholeheartedly, however, this book is bent toward women getting what they want from their husbands. I like the ""mother book"" better. Love and Respect by the same authors. Do it with your husband (or alone.) It's not so slanted. This book often makes men out to be manipulatable idiots."
5,Absorbing,"""The Republic of Dreams"" is like ""Griffin and Sabine"" in that it uses its illustrations and toys to bring you closer into the narrative. ""The Republic of Dreams"" has everything you could hope for in this type of novel. The sensuous narrative, surreal, subtly erotic illustration, and pull-out items such as the Poetic Licence and Republic Passport all make you feel as if you have taken a journey into this Republic. Unlike many Bantock and neo-Bantock works, ""The Republic of Dreams"" explores its ideas in depth. A wonderful mind-clearing diversion, especially useful for the poet and artist. Go, Crimmins, go."
3,A little bit of escape,"True - This is not Griffin & Sabine. This is a nice afternoon of suspended reality. A book that makes you want to slow down and really look at everything that is happening on the page. If there has ever been the hint of an artist or poet in you, you can recapture it for a minute in this book."
3,Stick with Bantock,"Somewhat entertaining, but could be much better. A modern ""abstract art"" remake of Bantock, and not as good. The plot is a bit lacking, and the air of sensuality seems to be conveyed by frequent protrayl of nude and topless women that left me feeling the author has a breast fetish. I like the idea of the abstract letters and telegrams, but they don't actually convey meaning. If you like the style and you have money to burn, I don't think it's a waste. However, I think anything by Bantock or Hodgson's ""The Tattooed Map"" are much better."
1,Disappointing,"Readers hoping for another ""Griffin & Sabine"" will be very disappointed in this bookm as will anyone who actually spends money on it. ""Republic"" lacks any sort of narrative, and what passes for poetry is really just a disjointed collection of inarticulate sentences. The Bantock-esque envelopes hidden throughout the book hold no surprises; only meaningless messages than cannot be considered enigmatic or beautiful by any stretch of the imagination. Moreover, Crimmins artistic style seems limited to retouching photos of nudes, by adding crudely painted animal heads. This story was a good idea, poorly executed. The author (and any potential readers) should check out anything by William Burroughs, or stick to reading The Forgetting Room."
4,"Forget ""Griffin and Sabine"" this is an actualy story","The Republic has allot to offer, from the passport to the maps and postcards(which are great). As a nudist I enjoyed the clothing optional atmosphere and the story was a great deal of fun. This is not the psychological foreplay of Bantock's work (there's actualy a story going on here). Although there could have been more nude men and a more diverse population (such as in size and ethnicity)but as a poet and an artist I found the Republic of Dreams a wonderful adventure and escape(the DaDaist artwork is wonderful). I'm looking forword to the next installment of the Republic of Dreams. As an African-American woman I see more potental in Mr. Crimmins's work than in anything that Nick Bantock has written so far."
1,Republic of Dreams,"Impossible to review completely, since the book I received had at least 5 pages torn out of it, which made it difficult to follow the ""storyline,"" if there was one."
4,.38 Special Successfully Try A New Sound And Style,"With DRIVETRAIN, .38 Special try on the influence of another artist who shares their pro-law-enforcement stance, Ted Nugent, and the results, while not quite up to the level of previous efforts, still earn the band 4 stars for the effort. The band knew that times were changing, and that they might do well with the biker crowd, so by extrapolating from artists such as Nugent, they were increasing their chances of selling more records. I think the reason why this one didn't sell that well is because longtime fans felt alienated by the new sound, but even though the results weren't entirely successful, at least .38 Special can be commended for trying."
1,Great until it broke!,I got this bracelet and was very excited. It came in the cutest baby blue bag. It was very pretty and the first day I wore it I got so many compliments. The next day I was in a meeting just sitting there and all of a sudden the bracelet broke and the beads went everywhere. I was very upset. Though it was not a lot of money the shipping price is unbelievable. I did not find that out until after I bought it. It is very pretty but I would not reccomend this product.
4,It's Cute,"It's cute and it does go with the earrings I had planned to match them with. I don't know why the list price is $15 as it's all plastic and thin elastic. So far the elastic hasn't popped even though I've worn it many times. As several people said, the ship price is higher than the price of the item."
1,Tiny disappointment!,"I ordered several of these bracelets for gifts; but, only one bracelet had pearls that were anywhere near 4mm. The pearls were so tiny that they looked like seeds instead of pearls. I decided to return them and look for something else. Don't waste your money."
3,Ambivalent,"I would have enjoyed it much more it hadn't been bogged down beneath so much description and interspection. People who enjoy the ""literary"" style of writing may well like it. The story is good, but I prefer a little faster pace."
4,The continuing relevance of Mark Lupher's work,"This book remains somewhat unusual among contemporary academic works in its broad sweep, its ""macro"" rather than ""micro"" approach. It is extremely ambitious, providing a theoretical framework for Russian and Chinese history that ties together patterns going back to the distant past on into the present. However, Lupher supports his ideas in detail; the book is very heavily researched. This is an academic book and a good one. The analysis is complex. I learned quite a bit from reading it. The account of ""the Land Reform"" movement was a real eye-opener. Mark is my brother and he has discussed his ideas on Russia and China with me on numerous occasions. These ideas, as he puts them forth in this book, are still very pertinent, and in some cases prescient."
5,"Lots of shock absorption, GREAT running shoe","The most comfy running shoe I've ever owned. I run about 3 miles a day, 5 days a week. This shoe is still in great condition and it's been about a year. Love it, and would buy another pair without hesitation. I love well it handles impact."
5,Movie,"Love, love, love Katherine and Michael in both these movies. Danny Devito was the best vindictive vilan yet. Great movies."
3,Great,I really enjoyed the Romancing The Stone movie but Jewel of the Nile was pretty flat in comparison. Still a great combo for the movie archives at home though.
4,2 good ones for 1 great price,"Two great adventure movies from the 80's for one nice price. Kathleen turner used to be pretty hot man. Get this set for a bored Saturday & you can't wrong, anamorphic or not."
2,What happen Amazon??,"First the box set was very bad the movie Jewel of the nile wasnt play and play very slow. After i returned amazon gift me a new box set(new??) first was open very bad, and the booklets inside was missing from romacing. Well its the first that happen, with amazon. Hope not a second."
2,Good for reference,"It does not elaborate enough on its explanations. If you have no previous knowledge of the subjects in the book, then you should not try to read it alone, because it skips to problem solving withouth giving the basic explanation about formulation rules and methods."
4,Great Old Classic with Relevance Today,"I enjoyed the lessons taught is the ""old days ways""! Sort of does remind me a bit of C.S. Lewis. Stories with meanings. Can be deep if you want it to be. Wisdom is always learned easier when there is a story with it - and this is a perfect example!"
2,"well,","Its just not my favorite Genre. This was a required reading in one of my friend's son's class. oh well. That's why the library is full of books. If you don't like one, abandon it and try another."
3,Not all that impressed,"I can see the main point of this book, and I think that's cool. ""Don't worry when bad things happen - good things are around the corner."" Or, to put it another way, ""All things work together for good."" But most of this book honestly annoyed me. Diamond is entirely too perfect (it starts to get on my nerves).However, there *are* some scenes that really touched me and really made me think. For instance, when Diamond goes to help the drunken cabbie and his family. I like it when George MacDonald makes these side-notes about society and how we often approach situations from the wrong angle. That was definitely worth it.After I read this, I went on to read ""The Lost Princess."" What a contrast! I went from reading about one angelically perfect boy to two horrendously bratty girls. I found the girls much more interesting! (And I felt like I could learn a few lessons myself regarding pride and humility)"
1,I Hate To Say It....,"Lester Young might be looked at as a jazz legend and he has every right to be, he is name checked by some of the best players that ever lived, but I honestly don't see what the big deal was. Of all the other great tenor saxophonists around at his time, there are better ones who had far better saxophone tones: Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, Budd Johnson to name a few. These players had a warm sound. Young's tone was very weak and feeble sounding. He also didn't have that many good melodic ideas. His music simply does nothing for me.This is my honest assessment of him. It is only an opinion and should be taken as one. Nobody likes the same jazz musicians. It doesn't make me right or wrong.Checkout Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster instead. They had a lot more expressive sounds than Young in my opinion."
4,Track 3 is the best one here,"Idlewild are like a Scottish version of early REM, with the grungier influences of their early releases largely gone now. The lead track on here is a fast, art-rock type track with a good chorus and some obtuse lyricisms, but track 3 is the real highlight. A cover of Sandy Denny's It'll Take A Long Time, the band have approached it superbly instilling real soul and tendernes to it. Although the second track is so-so and the first is on the album 1000 Broken Windows, this is worth it for this one track alone."
4,This is a Capitol Original from a Master Voice,"Some people should not lose historical perspective and should not mix up old and past of a master in singing. ""Lush Life"" is a superb program with 12 cool arrangements which honor GAS."
2,"very, very good","One of her better albums of the period. This version of 'Midnight Sun', done by so many, is, in my opinion, the definitive version hands down. Buy it for that alone...."
5,"Brilliant, Classy, and Classic !","Ms. Wilson performed these songs so brilliantly that Icannot imagine anyone surpassing or even equalingher efforts.She has created virtual cinematic experiences with eachand every piece.The arrangements are very lush and classy.If you like ""September of My Years"" by Frank Sinatrayou would probably like this album; they are very similar."
4,Great CD,My very favorite Jazz Female artist is Nancy Wilson. She can make any song sound like a winner!! I own several of her CD's.
3,Read as fiction only,"Hassel would have you believe that his books are based at least loosely on his own experiences on the eastern front, Erik Haaest suggests that this is far from the truth and that Hassel was a Nazi collaborator who never ventured outside Denmark. Who's correct I can't say, but some of the things that crop up in the text of various of the books cast doubt on the authors stance. For example he and the others are persistently dodging fire from or picking up Kalashnikovs, this would appear unlikely as the Russian army didn't equip with any Kalashnikov designed side-arms until 1947, making this rather difficult. He's also been known to ""Load magnetic mines into a panzerfaust"" The panzerfausts claim to fame was being the first disposable anti tank weapon, so this would appear to be an impossibility. These would appear to be the sort of mistakes unlikely from a serving soldier.Taken as fiction it's an OK but brutal read as are all his books, just don't take them as factual."
2,Disappointing Read.,Hassel's Legion of the Damned was a disappointing read. It was more or less a justification for Hassel having been on the wrong side of history. He seems to be saying that the penal battalions were just victims of the brutal Nazi regime which may be true but the characters are so unsympathetic and end up being just as brutal as the Nazi and in the end the only difference between the penal battalions and Nazi battalions is that the penal battalions couldn't were the German eagle crest on their uniform.Yes war is brutal and savage but give the reader someone to root for I couln't find anyone to care about in the entire novel.
1,Utter Rubbish,"This book, along with all other Sven Hassel books is so blatently false that it would be comical if the setting were anywhere else but WWII, an event that claimed the lives of millions of people. If you're largely unaware of WWII history, or specifically the true history of the German Army, by all means indulge in this work. If you are looking for a factual account written by a German soldier, do not buy this book!"
5,Possessions,"Bring all of John Callahan's book back into to print. I bought this book when it was first published and rarely do I re-read my books, but this one has drawn me several times to pick it up and re-read it. Unfortunately the message of the book is freedom from ""things"" and there is no way I can relinquish this book. Read.....and.....ENJOY"
4,"a great ""children's"" story","like all great fables, this one speaks to all of us. find this little book."

1,missing in action,i did not receive this cd.. so i cannot review it... i would hope that amazon credited my master card!
4,A complete classic,"If you watched it then, this is a perfect way to remember and still celebrate the holidays"
2,It's not as good as the movie,"When I bought this book I did not realize that it was written after the movie. It is not good Graham Greene. The book follows the movie closely but, it adds very little. As I read the story I miss the music. Save your money and buy the DVD."
2,weak greene.,"i have read 5 graham greene books and this is by far the lamest of them. this was conceived of first as a hollywood movie, and it shows. the book is not much more that a silly, corny thriller (just what hollywood orders over and over and over). there is very little character development involved, & the the sense of place (vienna after world war ii) could have been given much greater depth, as well. this is simply a plot being rushed onto the big screen ( a half-baked, lame plot, at that) to make some cash. pass this one by."
4,go along for the ride,"A 'knockabout' entertaining thriller, which pays homage to film noir. Small time, non too bright crook Harry (Downey) is mistaken for an actor and is taken along on a ride to LA, where he gets involved with Gay Perry (Kilmer) and is reunited with his childhood fantasy girl. Murders, a kidnapping gone wrong and a suicide are involved in an elaborate plot that is straight out of a dime crime novel. Along the way the plot takes a few twists and turns but mostly its spelt out for you. However that doesn't take away from the enjoyment. There's plenty of humour, plus the benefit of great chemistry between Kilmer and Downey."
4,Clever tribute to crime pix delivers both laughs and thrills,"""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is one of those humorous takes on the ""film noir"" genre that wants to have it both ways: it makes clever comments and funny asides about the conventions of the genre (mostly via voiceover narration) while, at the same time, wanting to tell a genuinely involving ""noir"" story, too. And I have to say that, for the most part, the film succeeds. While I'm not as madly in love with this movie as many of the reviewers here, I certainly didn't feel that it's the train wreck some on this site describe it to be. Discovering this on DVD, I found it to be slick, fun, and clever. Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer in particular seem to be having a lot of fun. The DVD features attractive, slickly designed menus, dynamite picture and sound, and some good extras (including a gag reel that for once is actually fun to watch). Check this one out."
4,Much Better The Second Time Around,"I did not care for the film the first time I watched it....thought it would be more action-oriented in the vein of ""Smokin' Aces"", or ""Lock, Stock..."".However, I gave it another chance, and I now rate it much higher......in fact, I've seen it about 4 times now. Enjoy."
5,A must for any movie buff.,I have been a fan of this film for a few years and was happy to learn that it was available for Blu-Ray. The film was clear and the picture was vibrant so if you have this film for DVD you may want to upgrade. The film is well worth it; it's dark humor is brilliant and I hope Robert Downy Jr. and Val Kilmer make more movies together.
5,Unpredictable,"To me, the movie's unpredictibility was its best feature. I just gave up trying to figure out the next scene, and just sat back and enjoyed the movie. It was great fun, and Robert Downey Jr. was genius, as usual. Kilmer was too funny."
5,kiss kiss bang bang,"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is the directorial debut of screenwriter Shane Black( of Lethal Weapon fame). A magical blending of noir, comedy, and action!Great image, strong detail on this HD DVD. Day and night scenes show strength of contrast. Colors are very bright, vivid, richly saturated and the image offers attractive flesh tones. The audio mix is pretty tight, with a surprising amount of surround effects for such a dialogue-heavy film.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is definitely one of my favorite HD DVD."
4,Too Much Bang Bang?,"This is a beautifully made film with fine performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer. My only difficulty with the movie is the amount of torture to which Downey's character is subjected. However, I may be an overly sensitive type and this does not really hurt this fine film. Like any good film noir, it is full of surprises as the dead bodies accumulate."
2,Too Clever By Half,"I love both Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer but I don't have a lot of positive things to say about this movie. I found it too talky and its plot was not believable. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief while watching it. None of the characters were endearing and it was a challenge to care about what happened to them. Also, in real life, there would be no chemistry between Downey's character and the female lead, Ms. Monaghan. Her history and the reprehensible manner in which she treats him would preclude his devotion (unless he was a complete masochist). Further, and to my disappointment as I'm an extremely politically incorrect person, I found all the gay jokes about Kilmer's Perry obtuse. I really don't think anyone cares about that stuff much in this day and age. Overall, the interactions are too clever by half, and Downey's narration is a bore. Most of what's supposed to be funny...is not--a waste of time in my view."
1,Damaged,"This DVD was rated to be in excellent condition, but the cover was badly damaged and almost unreadable. Avoid this seller."
3,"Good movie, but not a gay movie","This movie isn't bad. It's very violent, it's funny, and it has an interesting story. But if you are buying it because it is gay themed, think again. It is not a gay movie. In fact, there is very little gay content. The focus here is on violence and humor."
3,Self-conscious noir,"A small-time crook (Robert Downey Jr) stumbles into an audition while running from police and ends up with a free ticket to LA, where he becomes involved in a complicated scheme along with his high school sweetheart (Michelle Monaghan) and a gay PI (Val Kilmer). There is much to enjoy here, including some laugh-out-loud moments and some enthusiastic skewering of action movie cliches. In the end, however, it is a little too cute and self-conscious, though never boring. Stick around for the credits. Robert Downey Jr. co-wrote and performs the final song."
1,"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang","I really like both Actors in this movie, that's why I bought it...BUT the story line...NO COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT WATCH...QUIT AFTER 10-15 MIN."
4,"A gay detective and an actor, say no more!","Very slickly produced big budget crime movie that oozeswith a knowingly quirky style.Some cool acting from Downey, Kilmer. Quite funny in parts with witty one-liners.The final half of movie becomes disappointley conventional and the movie ends up feeling a little too smug for its own good.It's a hollow but then again fun ride, what more do you want?A DVD worth a spin!"
2,poor,"didnt like movie, dragged on and on, not enough action, just was not what i expected, would not recamend movie to anybody"
3,Great Acting but A Little Self Indulgent...,"Well casted, well acted, well filmed, and almost well written - Kiss Kiss Bang Bang intrigued me and turned out to be what I expected it to be: a quaint, slightly offbeat dark detective comedy. Nicely set up and compelling in the beginning - Downey and Kilmer make an unlikely but highly watchable duo. Downey is spot on as ever, but it's Kilmer who shines. Past the a-list, it's interesting to see Kilmer in different roles now. The plot however, turned out to be more complicated than Robert Towne's Chinatown and several other mysteries combined, and that turns out to be the film's undoing. We end up keeping up with it because of Downey's predicament, but ultimately this isn't quite an action, comedy or thriller but more of a headscratcher instead. Worth watching mainly if you're either a Downey or Kilmer fan - or really desperate to watch Corbin Bernsen!"
5,DVD,"Excellent movie, comedy with wit. Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer are excellent together. Michelle Monaghan steals every scene she is in, an oscar worthy performance!"
3,"Kiss, Kiss, Who Cares?","I wasn't sure what to expect going into this film, so I came to it with an open mind. What I came away with was that this is an ""Art Film"" wannnabe. The acting is Ok. It is good to see Robert Downey Jr. return to film and good to see Val Kilmer as well, but the film plods along baiting us into thinking that at any moment it is going to break into something other than an average film."
4,"Fun, well done.","There is something about this movie that makes people want to write reviews longer than the tax code but suffice to say, if you've seen enough Hollywood action spectaculars to realize how silly they are, you can't help but enjoy KKBB. Its well written, everybody in it is perfectly cast and its surprisingly easy to follow for an intentionally non-linear mess. It also manages to be funny and exciting while being totally absurd.The plot is intentionally too complex, the coincidences utterly implausible, the stunts are laughably over the top. But that's the idea. After seeing so many movies with ""messages"" about good, evil, life, death and infinity (usually based on comic books) its refreshing to something that's all in fun. This is one movie where both the actors and the audience get to have a really good time."
4,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Chuckle Chuckle,"As a complete sucker for all things hardboiled and noir (my patron saint is Raymond Chandler), I was probably the perfect audience for KISS KISS BANG BANG, a humorous pastiche of the pulpy detective tales and film noir classics of yesteryear.Self-referential to the nth degree, the storyline of KISS KISS is ridiculously spotty, but it's such good fun, I hate to quibble with any of it. It's an enjoyable, intelligent movie. Still, it must be pointed out that having Michelle Monaghan play Robert Downey's high school contemporary was just plain dumb. He's 11 years her senior... and he's seen a lot of hard road. That aside, the witty tweaks and nods with the genre's formula are more than enough to compensate for this misstep. Nicely done!SIDELIGHT: Thank goodness that Johnny Knoxville of JACKASS fame was replaced by Downey in the lead role. Robert had his character's clueless, wounded persona down, and served as a great foil for the unexpectedly funny Val Kilmer."
4,Few kisses and plenty of bang!,"Very art noir. Compelling and somewhat casual flim making technique. Story is all over the place until neatly comes together at the end, only slightly predictable. Enjoyable and fun."
3,"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang dvd","Bought as a gift; my girlfriend loves this movie. It's a decent action comedy where Robert Downey Jr. plays himself (not literally, but, you know, plays his sarcastic, lucky, cocky, ruggedly handsome, edgy dude like in Iron Man- what he does best) and gets caught up in a plot surrounding a girl, bad guys, guns, money, love and a gay Val Kilmer.Some good action and comedic scenes for this crime-filled love story. 3 out of 5 stars just because I normally don't like this type of film and nothing memorable happened in it despite RDJ & Kilmer's acting (on par)."
5,Criminally Underrated,One of RDJ's best movies also written and directed by Shane Black who made Lethal Weapon and is directing Iron Man 3.
4,Best not to know ...,"This is an unexpectedly funny, exciting film to watch...especially when you see it with no knowledge of what to expect. If you like intelligent, funny, and suspenseful movies, this fits the bill. I only wish that I had first seen ""The Truman Show"" the same way."
2,What was the point?,"This movie made no sense to me. It was boring after the opening scene.Not sure what the plot was. Some girl rehooks up with Robert Downey Jr., there are car chases, people get shot and killed, there are trashy Hollywood chicks at parties.Only saving grace to this film was Val Kilmer."
2,Over the Hill Gang,"It would be nice if every actor could age gracefully, like Sean Connery. But time is not always that kind and in this movie we have a collection of actors who just look awful compared to our memories of 30 years ago. If we had never seen them when they were young, it probably wouldn't bother us that this or that character looks burnt-out or bloated or bald. But since we do remember what they used to look like, it is hard to not be distracted from the story by thinking how awful they look now."
1,An exceptionally bad movie,"This movie features trashy, unlikeable characters, juvenile jokes, sophomoric dialog, lots of t&a, an unbelievable plotline and little else. It is one of those movies where you keep checking your watch and wondering when it will be over. A waste of the talents of Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer. I will agree with another reviewer who said the cinematography was good. Director of cinematography: Michael Barrett."
1,We Didn't Like It!,"Wow! If they had left the ""F"" word out of this movie, there wouldn't have been much dialog!!!! Could have been great, but our poor ears were cringing! Not even funny. What a disappointment. There are a lot better comedies out there."
2,A lot of Nothingness,"Dont let the casting fool you...Kilmer can act but anything with Robert Downey jr is bound to be empty cotton candy fodder. The story is non existant, the acting woody,the script useless.This movie does not deserve a look at all.I really wont decend into the habit of rating films just because of well know actors are in them as those said actors have you focus on them instead of the movie it'self and thus we rank the film based on the actors' reputations instead of the quality of the film.My Verdict: CRAP Film."
5,Magnifica Película,"Una película sumamente entretenida, con interpretaciones magníficas tanto de Downey como de Kilmer.El Blu Ray tiene muy buena imagen y sonido, real mejora sobre el DVD."
3,Great price,"Good buy, disc was brand new, not too much for special features but a great flick that's fun too watch."
3,"Hackneyed Plot, But Well Done","Donald Pleasance is top-notch as the mild-mannered little nobody who inadvertently creates a monstrously destructive force, while trying to help the space program develop telekinetic motive force.Previous reviewers note that the characters in this piece are not sympathetic, but in large part the story utilizes that fact to drive home its point. People around Pleasance begin to suffer - and soon, die - as a result of his discovery, solely because he had some petty squabble with them. This is a story about real people, not ideal ones. If the characters being hurt by Pleasance were all heroic, the story would rapidly become comic melodrama. The fact that they are so everyday, and not exactly noble, is what makes ""the power"" so frightening. It also makes Pleasance's final sacrifice the more heroic, in and of itself - he would rather die, than harm even some ...schmoe.This is not a great OL, but is a good one. The effects are especially memorable."
1,Inexcuseably amatuerish,"eXistenZ was a very good movie, but the book version...!Of course, novellisations of movies tend to be bad, but this one was way in at the deep end of bad. There was no tension, no suspense, and the writer managed to give away every surprise plot-point before its time. The characters are flat and lifeless, the dialogue is corny and unrealistic... I refuse to believe this guy ever won awards for his writing, which is what the back of the book claims. Maybe he was paying attention when he wrote the award-winning stuff."
3,One Crazy Novel,Existenz was more like amovie than a video game. The whole origin of the game was to kill the creator of it. The movie centered around video game creator Allegra Gellar. During this time the game creators were worhiped like gods and players can actually enter the game. Things turn sour when certain people try to kill Gellar. She must then go into hiding with her guard Ted Pikal. Soon Gellar must go inside the game because she feels the game is sick. She insists that Pikal come iwth her and he agrees. This movie was wierd but I like the idea of people actually being a part of the game. Thas was very intriguing. The ending has a twist to it.
1,The uneXistenZ of Priest's eXistenZ,"Priest's book isn't a good transposition of Cronenberg's eXistenZ, in my opinion. I'll give you some short items: 1. there are many different things and episodes between them 2. the author describes characters' feelings in a way that has no correspondance with their behavior 3. the book explains really EVERYTHING! The readers should have the chance to try to play their own game! 4. why in the end TranscendenZ and not transCendenZ? Anyway, I'm not a writer, only a reader, and I hope you will not get angry for my comments! Bye, Paola"
4,A pleasure to use,"So far I have only used one disk. Another poster said to learn the japanese syllabary first, by using the Human Japanese disk, so that is what I did. It is a wonderful program, this Human Japanese, and I have very much enjoyed learning from it. This program was worth it for just this program, and I hope the rest is just as wonderful."
4,You're Own Guided Tour - Up Close,"Maybe I was a Freemason in a past life, which is the only way I could explain my great interest in this subject. In fact, one of my hobbies is cemetery-hunting and I love going around and finding all the old graves that have the Freemason motif on them. I tend to wonder what the lives of these now-dead men were like.Consider this set of DVDs your own personal tour into the world of the Freemasons. The curtain has been lifted from the Great Lodge and we're granted a close-up view of its history, rules, and those who have been in it through time. Wait until you see this Freemasons Hall in London! There's nothing modern about it. Instead, the lodge rooms are old and magnificent, and the museum holds many interesting pieces worn by previous members. John Hamill also explains quite well all of the symbolism and rites that are associated with this ""secret club."" I greatly enjoyed Inside the Freemasons: The Grand Lodge Uncovered."
4,"No expose, and that's okay.","Inside The Freemasons is, surprisingly and perhaps refreshingly, not a conspiracy film. It is a sober and highly informative presentation of contemporary Freemasonry by John Hamill, chief officer of the Grand Lodge of England, and goes a long way to explain what Freemasonry has stood for throughout history and how it stands in society today. Those whose interest in Freemasonry goes beyond conspiracy theory will learn a great deal about why five million people around the world choose to belong to this fraternal order and why Mr. Hamill chooses to describe the non-public aspects of Masonic ritual as ""private"" rather than ""secret."""
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was hesitant to watch this film, only because I wasn't sure how interesting a tour of the Grand Lodge would actually be. Naturally, like most books and films relating to the Freemason society, this film proved equally fascinating. I was pleasantly surprised by how much information was revealed and enjoyed the tour thoroughly. The pace of the tour was steady and John Hammill, the Communications Director of the United Grand Lodge of England, was an excellent guide, providing background and revealing the symbolism behind motifs along the way. Perhaps it is a testament to Hammill's ability as a host or perhaps it is the mystery behind the subject matter, but my curiosity and interest remained constant throughout the duration of the film."
4,Goes beyond the hype of Hollywood,"If you're looking for conspiracy theories about the Masons, this isn't your dvd. However, if you want the TRUTH about Masons and their history then you will enjoy this dvd."
4,Very informative,"While I am not a Freemason, I have relatives who were, and so this subject has always interested me. I like this DVD because it presents facts, and it shows a glimpse of their private world. Seeing the Grand Lodge in England is very cool for many reasons--it is beautiful first of all, and also it has meaning for me on a personal level. This was definitely worth my time."
2,A disappointment after sucj a winning first book,"The authors previous book about Sports Arguements was thought provoking and so easy to read.This successor seems to have been assembled very quickly witout a lot of deep thought. I looked forward to the next two hundred arguements but as with many authors Mr Russo appears to have just one noteworthy book in his head.I am genuinely disappointed but this will be in the reainder section by the fall.In short, not a terrible idea for a book but poorly executed."
4,Sports Arguements-The Sequel!,"It's a good thing Chris Russo wrote Greatest Sports Arguements of All-Time before this book. Whereas his first book covered a wide-ranging field of sports topics, this book narrows its focus to 10 specific (though still broad) lists. Instead of giving a list of, say, greatest coaches and then narrowing it by sport, as in the first book, he simply throws the category wide-open and picks the 10 best in ALL SPORTS. So you have Vince Lombardi, Casey Stengel, Red Auerbach & Scotty Bowman competing for the top spot in this category. Russo writes in a very conversational style, not too heavy on stats, just enough to keep you intrigued. As an auto racing fan though I have say his opinions on NASCAR are a little misinformed. But that's just my opinion, there's plenty of fuel for arguements here just like in his previous book."
2,Mobo Jumbo,To practice this you will need to make a recording or buy one from the author or another copy cat.I don't want to spend another $15 for it or spend a day making a tape.Thanks Amazon for the refund.
3,b,"The book gives you a very good description and in depth knowledge of what you hear in the cd but it is a very dreary and monotone reading. If you are able to meditate on your own without the cd it could be very useful, otherwise the cd is a much better option."
5,"Beautiful book, thorough yet easy to read","This is a classic recommended by all my yoga teachers. Having practiced yoga nidra with several teachers, it was wonderful to receive the book and immediately have a deeper understanding of what we were doing and why. This is an easy read, but not over-simplified. It's thorough and full of depth and thought-provoking stories and commentary. Highly recommended."
1,Never Again!,"This may be a good microwave product in general, but mine arrived with a broken casing. After trying to get the vendor to respond, I called my credit card company, which prompted the vendor to get serious. They sent out Fed Ex to get the item, but that was before Thanksgiving and now its January and I am still waiting to see a refund on my credit card bill. Thank heavens for my credit card company - they are taking over the problem for me. Amazon doesn't do a thing to help resolve the situation. I sure won't buy anything like this through Amazon's vendors again."
4,Good Product.,"Bought my wife this game for Christmas(2008) because her older sister had one when they were growing up. It is out of stock, so I had a hard time finding one in good condition, but I found one on Amazon that was in pretty good shape. My wife was ecstatic. The game is fun, but a little subjective. I enjoyed it."
5,Awesome Game!!,"This is one your family will play no matter what their ages, although kids under 13 would probably have a little trouble getting it. The only downside is that there's no more cards to buy once you've played them all!"
3,"Very cute, for younger ages!","Great little bean bag. Slightly overstuffed, and a little on the smaller side. Great for children 1-6. Any older than that and I would go with a larger sized chair."
2,So-so bean bag chair.,"I bought this for my 3 yr old. It's a plastic-y material which I didn't really like. It seems over stuffed and not comfortable. My husband sits on it a lot, hoping to ""break it in."""
2,Kids sports baseball futon,Too big for a child. Zipper broken not able to use child was very frustrated as too full for a child.
3,not worth the $,"The beanbag is cute, but should cost about half of what I paid. Not high quality, just a fun product. Dont waste your money."
4,Very Nice,"I bought this bean bag for a children's area in a sports themed Barbershop. The bean bag is very firm and will need to be broken in to have that true bean bag flop down and sit feel, but it is a good size and I am very pleased with it."
3,"Cute, comfie, but not very durable","This is a cute chair. I am a petite mom (115 lbs) who likes to lean against it while reading to my twin toddlers. After a couple of years of use, one of the seams is starting to come apart."
3,What should I say..,"This item took the longest to get to my house out of everything that I had purchased on amazon on the same day, no idea why.. as it's so small..When I plugged the device in with an old mouse, it made me restart my computer, so I did that but my computer wasn't doing anything.. it seemed to have gotten stuck on one part.. I had to forcefully shut down my computer. The computer lost the data for the device so I would have to re download it.Now I'm too afraid to use it, because I think it will crash my computer again.."
1,Horrible,This is adapter is horrible. Only one key works at a time. If you're walking forward in a game and move to the right or left the w key will stop working and you will stop in your tracks
1,Wrong item description and doesn't work.,"The item is for PS2 to USB, not the other way around like it should be. The item got to me rather in a week or so, but it was nonfunctional. I did however contact the seller and they refunded me my money."
4,Get it for the VD comercial if nothing els!,"A very clever, creative and funny ( for the most part ) sketch comedy from 1974 which had predated, and no doubt even inspired SNL ( even featuring future star of that program Chevy Chase it's worth noting ). The VD commercial ( ""Hello, I'm Safety Sam!"" ) is particularly hilarious and classic! Worth owning just for THAT at the very least!"
1,Oh my was this bad.,"I have no idea how it came to be stuck in my head that the the Groove Tube was a ""great, funny,"" movie. I saw it in 1974 at a drive in theatre and over the years had remembered it to be wonderful. Oh how wrong I was.I finally got a copy to show my wife this little ""gem"" of a movie from my youth. With the exception of about three mildly funny scenes, it was horrible. I don't even want to give this away to anyone as I would feel bad for wasting their time should they watch it."
1,Boring and amateurish - you can have my VHS for free,"I'm a great fan of all kinds of comedy, but this is incredibly amateurish and boring. Unfunny sketches that go on and on, completely unfunny. If you pay the postage, you can have my VHS copy for no extra charge. Otherwise I'll just throw it away. Awful."
1,"Cheap, Uncreative Excrement","If Amazon.com let me, I would have rated this dvd NEGATIVE 5 stars. Some actors really do some movies that stink, but this is one of the very, very, very few movies Chevy Chase acted in that smell like it had been floating in a sewer for centuries. The true indication that comedy is uncreative is when they resort to nudity as a crutch. One scene was really obscene. The scene was a children's clown asking every non-kid to leave the room before he read sexually explicit passages from romance novels. If you are thinking of buying this, do this. Cash your paycheck. Pay your bills and with what is left, flush it directly down the toliet so you can cut out the middle man."
1,TERRIBLE!,Me and my girlfriend bought this movie one night and I was appauled.We turned it off after 30 minutes.And when the store didn't let me return it it went right into my fire place.I hated it.
3,A little dated but still has its moments,"I first saw this movie when I was in college in the mid 1970s. It was pretty radical for its time as it predated the original Saturday Night Live. It is made up of a number of individual bits, most of which were topical at the time. There are references to 2001 A Space Odyssey, the Watergate hearings, Vietnam, counterculture drug dealers, etc. and features the first screen appearances of Chevy Chase and Richard Belzer.If you are nostalgic for those times and willing to suffer some misses along with the real laughs, this movie is for you."
5,Funny!,Another funny movie from the past. I bought this and Kentucky Fried Movie so how can you go wrong with these.
4,"When The Groove Tube hits, it is a riot.","I first saw this movie about five years ago with a friend who had just had surgery. She nearly busted her stitches out. You will not laugh harder than when this movie hits its target. There are some sketches that miss their target, but overall, it is really funny, and best of all there are several different levels of humor, if you like slapstick, there is plenty here. If you are more intellectual, and like irony, this movie has that, too. I just bought it and it is even better now that I am a little older and get some of the references. Check out ""Brown 25,"" ""The Dealers,"" and ""Koko the Clown."" These three, especially should have you near tears."
5,Histarically twisted,"This movie is wrong in every aspected of the word. This Shapiro masterpiece summarizes the 70's in a nut shell. From Beggining to end it is parody genius at its best. ""Move on up"" by Curtis Mayfield is a perfect song for this movie. From the first scetch about the hitchhiker, the Koko show, the Dealers, Kramp TV kitchen, ""Safty Sam"" vanareal disease awareness (the men might want to leave the room during this scene), and the evening news. Not to mention the commercial parodies and plain 70's commentary. This movie is one to be enjoy in every household and enjoyed many times over and over again. Ever time i have seen this movie it keeps getting better and better revealing its underling humor. This guy Ken Shapiro is probably in a cave or jail or his own private island, maybe a combination of each. This is comedy at its best."
4,Feed Your Head,"I'll probably revise this later because it's been many years since I saw this. But back in the 70's this was a late night and drive in favorite. Like I said I haven't seen it for many years and I'm guessing that it's probably not as funny as it used to be afer a few tokes, but I think it'll still be worth a watch because this was the beginning of the kind of humor we found later in SNL. Much of the humor is subtle and can easily go over your head if you're not aware of what's going on, but if you are then there's a lot of fun here. In fact I still remember having to take a second look at the end VD talk to realize what that puppet actually was...It was the absurdity that made it so funny...."
3,"Funny movie, terrible DVD transfer","A lot of the skits are dated but the non-dated stuff is hilarious. Unless you are a baby boomer you won't get the dated jokes, unless you know about Pop culture of the early 70's. The DVD video quality is awful though, they could have did a better transfer. The video is dull and grainy. Its also a Pan & Scan 4:3 ratio! What happened to the widescreen??"
2,It was a lot funnier 30 years ago,"I bought ""The Groove Tube"" as a gift for my husband. We did the grind house / cult movie / midnite movie circuit when we started dating 30 years ago. Although it was fun to see Chevy Chase and Richard Belzer (among others) when they were just starting their careers, this movie has lost something over time. It is no longer shocking or rebelious, just kinda silly and a little gross.For those who want a ""blast from the past"", Kentucky Fried Movie holds up much better!"
3,Funny Movie but DVD is lacking,"I have little to add to what the other reviewers have to say, but I'm surprised no one mentioned that this DVD has no extras (forgiveable) and is a fairly crummy print of the movie in pan and scan only (unforgiveable). The Koko The Clown segment is pure genius and probably the best thing in the movie. I was surprised at how well this film has held up, having not seen it in years. This film must have inspired _The Kentucky Fried Movie_ and the little known _Can I Do It Till I Need Glasses?_ (which is much cruder than Groove Tube or KFM). I gave this movie 3 stars due to the crummy print of the film, not due to the content."
3,CUTE,"SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. BUT, LIKE KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE, THE BABES WERE MY MAIN MOTIVATION FOR SEEING IT AGAIN. I DID ENJOY THE FINAL SEEN THO, WHERE THE DIRECTOR DOES HIS SONG AND DANCE ACROSS PARTS OF NEW YORK'S FINANCIAL DISTRICT OF THE EARLY 70'S."
3,3-1/2 Stars,"I agree with parts of the two extreme, opposite ratings already given. Scott's section on class alone is worth the price of book and has turned up many high priced winners. The PCR(perf. class rating) method will burn out anyone quickly. And I'm a whiz in doing numbers in my head, but no one can stick with that for long. Using last race ability times will turn up many winners in sprints, and top class ratings the same for routes. I give it 3-1/2 stars."
3,Missed The Buzz,"I got Bumblebee way back in junior high, and I really enjoyed the toy at the time. In vehicle mode, it comes in a nice chrome-yellow color and had wheels with rubber tires (I think). And you're not sure which side Bumblebee's on, the Autobots logo is printed underneath. This toy can also transform into a pretty simple robot mode, with posable arms and a flipping head that looks like cheez whiz molded over a cracker. While old-school fans may snatch up the little tike, new fans may turn it down for the new Transfromers on the block."
5,Masterpiece!!,"This album is truly one of the BEST progressive works I've ever heard! In fact, it's easily became one of my all time favorites & I just bought it! If you're a fan of perfect musicianship, clean production, & catchy rock melodies, this album is it! I wish there were more collaborations w/ Stan Meissner & Peter Fredette (the 2 musicians of Metropolis), because this album shows off their talent to the max & it makes you want more! By the way, the song ""The Eyes of Love"" is one of the greatest songs/ballads I've ever heard! And, ""The Darkest Side of the Night"" is on this album (the main theme song from Friday the 13th Part 8.) This album has to be heard to be believed...don't hesitate to get this one...you won't be sorry!"
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought two of these so that my husband and I could use them on our chairs at the beach. Mine did clamp on the chair, but kept swinging around in the wind. My husbands had a faulty clamp so he never could use his. Figured it would cost too much to ship it back so we threw it away. Now looking for a full-sized sand umbrella."
1,broken clamp,"I had high hopes for this product. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. The very first time I used this umbrella, the plastic clamp broke. I will not buy this product again."
3,a favorable end result,"The chair umbrella was delivered very quickly;however, it was not in one piece at arrival...the umbrella rod that attaches to the plastic handle was broken off at the base of the handle....the umbrella part itself was fine. I was pleased with the way the company that shipped the umbrella handled this issue having said that I did not need to return it(shipping cost more than the item itself)as this umbrella was now out of stock and would ask Amazon to credit my account. I am happy to report that this has taken place. I think that had the item been shipped with more packing material or in a less wide box, the damage may not have occurred.The above aside, a good item for the money. Thanks."
3,clamp-on umbrella,"delivery ok, product made in China - so quality is not the greatest, still a good buy for price"
2,umbrellas,"The umbrellas looked nice and I bought them because I have had similar for the local swimming pool lifeguard chairs. These umbrellas, however, were made very cheaply...all broke the first day they were used!"
4,Beach umbrella clamp,Works easily and fits the bill. Clipped on to my umbrella and hung our towels to dry in between swims and a few other light items. Very convenient.
5,Great story for bedtime and christmas,"I love this story and I cant stop watching this video. It is well done with voices and character development. The moral is timeless and I recommend this as a good family video for young kids. When I watch this video, I feel like a kid again."
2,"Second Most Disturbing Version of ""A Christmas Carol""","This is the second most disturbing version of ""A Christmas Carol"" that I've ever seen. I bought it inspite of the fact that it features the voice of Whoopi Goldberg, because I collect and watch as many versions as I can, and because it features the voice of Tim Curry, whose work I do admire.I thought Scrooge's dog was a cute addition to the classic tale, but I stopped watching it when the Ghost of Christmas Present appeared looking like Oprah Winfrey in a gigantic green bathrobe, and sounding like Dame Edna. Apparently, there was a disconnect between the cover illustrator and the animated graphics department, because the Ghost of Christmas Present is white on the cover, but black in the movie.Too disturbing! The only version I've seen more disturbing than this one is Tchaikovsky's ""Nutcracker Christmas Story,"" which features men in thongs, one of them with devil horns on his forehead, cracking a whip at the others."
1,Product does not work & Serrvice is terrible,"When I powered the screen for the first time it automatically went all the way down and stayed blocked in the open position.I called the seller and was instructed to change a fuse. This was quite difficult for a non technical user.After changing fuse it still remained blocked in open position. After calling again they sent me a replacement circuit board and told me I had to change it myself!!! This was even more difficult and absurd for me. However I tried disassembling the whole screen removing old circuit board and rewiring all the wires, the hardest part was putting everything together again. The result: the screen went all the way up and then stayed stuck in that position!!!Called back and they finally agreed to replace the whole thing. That was more than three weeks ago ans I still have not received replacement."
2,Good bathroom reading,"This book fits easily into a shirt pocket and contains little snippets of feng shui advice. If you are very heavy into that sort of thing, it is probably too light a book for you. If you barely know what feng shui is or don't buy into it, then the book's advice is still practical in that it gets you thinking about simple changes you can make at your workplace to enhance its decor. If you are like me and tend to have clutter all over your desk, and your only wall decorations are a calendar you got for free and a picture of your mom, then you probably you ought to check out this book."
2,"Good Pictures, Terrible Durability","This camera took some great pictures, and I enjoyed it's size and functionality for several months. I was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when I was passing it to a friend who was also seated. The camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass. THE END. The lens assembly is shot, according to my local camera store, not economical to fix. This was about the softest fall a camera could take, and not work, it was like landing on a pillow. I will not buy HP cameras again."
3,didnt make sense,"This book was OK,but I know a ten year old girl, and she is nothing like ana. I mean, what ten year old knows what optrician means but has a friend who doesnt know what fantasies are! And also, what kind of ten year old is concerned with ""love affairs?"" This book had a good plot, but unrealistic characters."
5,A wonderful book that opens the door to the entire series,"All of the Anastasia books are great!They are true to life, yet let you know that not all ""good Ideas"" work out as planned.I highly recommend the entire Anastasia series to any child.These books are sure to get anyone, old or young, excited about reading!I have always loved these books and at 24 years of age still occasionally check them out at the library!Lois Lowry has a definite flair for writing and even the most trivial happenings come off as interesting.In the Anastasia series she covers many common ""kid"" type problems, such as moving, birth of a sibling, boyfriends,phone solicitors,first job, embarassement, etc"
3,Anastasia Krupnik,A ten year old girl going through an exciting yet confusing life runs into obsticles that change her life. For instance she falls deeply in love with a crazy boy who has a last name for a first name. Washburn Cummings. He's a crazy boy that got sent home because he came to school with an insane writing on his t-shirt. It leaves you hanging on about everything and makes you want to read on. When she finds out her mom is pregnant she gets mad. Her mom and dad decide she can name her baby brother. The worst name she could think of is Boy Krupnik or Girl Krupnik. When her Grandmother dies she decides that she would name it- in honer of her grandmother- SAM.This is the kind of book that lets you skip chapters and still you know what's going on. It makes you want to keep on reading and then read the series.
3,Anastasia debut doesn't bring the house down,"Anastasia Krupnik doesn't match up to the others. Anastasia is interested in a boy named: brace yourself: Washburn Cummings. Washurn has an afro and listens to Roberta Flack. Hmm. Washburn does not like Anastasia. Anastasia sticks with her goldfish, Frank, and her little green notebook. Somehow, this doesn't match the other books."
1,Anastasia Krupnik,"I usually enjoy all of Lois Lowrys books, but this one was terrible. I definatly did not enjoy it. It was very pointless, it skiped from plots, and it was not enjoyaable at all from my point of view. I think it is a very bad read and I don't think I could ever read it again, or any of the next books in the series."
5,Grew up on these,"One of the major moments in my childhood came when I read that Myron Krupnik kept his poetry manuscripts in the crisper drawer of the fridge so they wouldn't burn in a fire. My father (also a poet, also an English professor) did the exact same thing. I vaguely remember jumping up and down on my bed and wanting to move to Boston.Buy these for your child, even if you're not a poet. They're wonderful."
1,Talk about bland...,"This first disc has the first four Burn-Up episodes of this new series. And they are bland. The stories are too simple, the artwork too normal, the character design almost too realistic (what happened to the jiggle factor folks?), the opening and closing music is boring, the future does not even look like the future but for a few items they tossed in to make it sci-fi.While I'm happy to hear Wendee Lee and Lex Lang, I miss Tiffany Grant, Beth Wernick and Amanda Winn-Lee.The main characters just don't feel right (too tame in most cases) and the humor just isn't there. I think they may have run out of steam or ideas."
2,Burn-Up Scramble,"Boring, a waste of time and money and it is boring. Perhaps if Burn-Up W,etc, never came out first,this might have had something going for it but it is BORING!"
5,Ten discs of Billie Holidays recordings with Columbia,"Billie Holiday / Lady Day: The Complete Billie Holiday on Columbia / 1933-1944 / The imported ""Golden Years"" budget version:Billie Holiday was a true vocal artists and this 10 CD set is fantastic. I had the old ""Quintessential Billie Holiday"" set and this new version of those recording is far superior. This imported ""Golden Years"" version is far less expensive than the U.S. version yet has the same recordings. This is a Five Star set."
5,Wow!,I've never heard these recordings sound better! And I guess I don't need to discuss them. Everyone knows how great they are. No matter how they sound.I've been listening to fake stereo versions of these that I folded down into mono but they never sounded like this. I also had a few of Columbia's Quintessiantal albums but they don't sound like this either. And I have a lot of this music on vinyl but these discs are really bringing this music to life for me.These disc are a revelation. Highly recommended. Jazz at it's finest! Plus Teddy Wilson and Lester Young really shine on these discs. If you're interested in them these discs are a must.
3,Great all purpose lens,"Nice lens. Although a little bit heavy, it is sturdy, fast, and looks good on your camera. However, mine had some serious front focusing problem.Considering price/performance, this is a great lens. But keep in mind that you might have to send it back to Sigma for calibration which takes about over two weeks."
2,Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 EX DG,"I have this lens for about one year and for a time he began to peel the paint that has glass, are tiny particles that are littering the lens, the focus now is being vague and takes longer to get it. It turned out to be such a good lens.Tengo este lente hace aproximadamente 1 año y desde hace un tiempo empezó a descascararse la laca que tiene en el cristal, son pequeñas partículas que están ensuciando el lente, el foco se esta impreciso y ahora tarda más en buscarlo. No resultó ser tan buen lente."
3,It's hit and miss,"When this lens is on... it's really sharp! Problem is, when it misses its completely blurry and the pictures are worthless (which comes out to about 20% of the shots). I don't use this lens very much because I just can't rely on it. Several nice crisp shots followed by one or two really soft ones. That changes when I'm shooting with a flash... it focuses great and consistently."
4,"Great range, but a touch on the soft side","i purchased this lens for the lower aperture, and the range of focal length. I use this lens exclusively on my canon 5d, shooting RAW and using the back button to control focus points, and the first time i used it for a shoot, i noticed that the images came out a tad bit soft. after working with it some more, and getting a feel for how it performs best, i have come to trust it more. however, i would not recommend using this lens when shooting in a low-light situation, unless you plan on shooting manual focus."
2,Sigma 24-70 horrid,I will have to send this back to Sigma. It is horribly soft at 2.8 up to 5.6. Would have loved to have bought the Nikon as I think you get what you pay for.
2,Focus problems,"As a wedding photographer, I've rented the Canon version but can't afford to buy it at over $1,100. So I bought this less expensive lens without testing it first.The problem I'm having is focus. About 40% of the shots are not in focus. I only use the lens for low light situations and prefer the 24-105mm IS lens for most other situations. I'm not sure if there is a problem with the lens I received or if it's an inherent problem with all the 24-70mm lenses by Sigma.Now the lens stays in the bag while I use a 50mm prime for most low light situations, it focuses better in low light situations and it's always sharp."
3,you paid for what you get,"This is not a good lens to use. Aperture F2.8, 16-32 are useless because it is too soft. It is very heavy. A good filter of 82mm is very expensive. If you have the money, you should buy the canon's 24-70 L lens."
1,WMVHD is jittery,"I have a very high end computer and can run other WMVHD videos from my machine just fine. This one for some reason is very jittery regardless if it is ran in 720p or 1080p.It looks like a very cool video, but it just doesnt seem to work properly."
5,Beautiful Music and Cinematography,"I LOVED this film! If you want to learn about the sea, see it's breathtaking wonders and bathe in wonderous music composed by Sting, ""The Living Sea"" will take you on this journey. I bought ""The Living Sea"" music CD as well, and the music is SOOOOOO gorgeous...I listen to it all the time. The music itself is healing, uplifting, carries a great spirit, free like the ocean...each song a masterpiece!The filming is truly outstanding...clear, crisp, colorful, alive,...magical...! Anything made by MacGillivray Films (this is an OMNIMAX film) will be amazing, truly the finest films I have ever seen in my life....[...]. I am a TRUE FAN!!! Donna Harrington"
4,Awsome picture quality,"It's a great to have HD content even before the HD-DVD or Blue Ray discs start shipping. Picture and sound quality are great, Stings music reallly brings something extra to the soundtrack compared to other IMAX films."
3,Not what I expected.,"The Living Sea is supposed to be one of the most important films on the vast blue realm, but it was a disappointment when I viewed it. It does not have very much sea footage. In fact, a single episode of Secrets of the Ocean Realm contains more underwater footage than this! If they wanted to stick a scene on the Coast Guard, surfers, or lore like that in the movie, the film should be called ""View of the Coast Men"", or ""The Amazing Silver Surfers"" instead of ""The Living Sea.""The title very much deceives a lover of the ocean. You expect it to document some battles between a Fringehead fish, or Hammerhead sharks, or anything, but basically all that is astounding about the sea in this movie is the swarm of jellyfish, which adds in another star out of two. Still not quite worth it. If you want a cool epic video truly on the ocean buy ""The Blue Planet"" series or ""Secrets of the Ocean Realm"" volumes. You have the right to disagree, but be assured that you WILL see better films."
5,Loved it,I've been looking for a dvd featuring sealife for a longtime as it's so relaxing to put on before bed. This is superb!
1,"SURFING VIDEO - Where's the fish, reefs, scenery?","This is not worth $7.99 although I paid $12.00.Way Over-rated and totally misnamed.It's the WORSTS documentary? ever... UNLESS you're a SURFER!The Beegees would be proud! Surfer Guys / No Girls..?Surfs-up Dude! Ride the wave - but don't look underneath.Funny, I thought this was about ""The Living Sea"".Where are the Reefs, Fish, Coral, Oceans, and Islands?Oh - they must be under all the surfers' scenes.Sad excuse to own a Blue-Ray..."
5,Outstanding!!!!!,"Between the outstanding video, the water and the Soundtrack with Sting, definitely one the best, if not the best, IMAX films made so far. Watching this film with Surround Sound is a most amazing experience. If you are a Sting fan this is a definite must have..."
3,Wish the transfer was better,"I liked the surfing scenes and thought it was a good balance between under and on top of the water scenery. The reason I am deducting two stars is viewing the Blu Ray on my 1080p 58"" plasma via HDMI and quality BD80 panasonic player I could notice white flecks and sports at a random t5ime, sort of like watching a worn out print of a movie in a movie theater. The transfer did not seem too great."
3,Beautiful but ineffective marine mash-up,"No doubt this film was much more impressive in IMAX theaters, but even on your home screen, the beautiful images will inspire awe. On that count, there is no reason to disparage this film. However, I would have preferred that the magnificent images be wedded to fascinating content as well. The general message of this film is: ""The sea is important and we have to protect it."" No duh. In service of this message, the filmmakers breeze through a number of interesting subjects, each of which would make a captivating film by themselves, that have no relationship to each other beyond their mutual connection to the sea.Show me a film about the Coast Guard's rescue teams. Show me a film about the discovery of deep sea creatures such as the massive cyphonophon. Show me a film about the unique eco-system of the isolated ocean lakes of the Palau Islands and the natives who tend the reefs there. But please don't mash them all together like this."
4,The Living Sea,I really enjoyed the music and scenery. I think it is wonderful. My small children enjoyed watching it as well. It is good for the whole family to watch together.
2,Deceptive Video Quality,"The subject and video scene compositions are interesting. The video quality is poor when moving fishes or shadows are displayed, jagged lines are seen as if resolution was only 240 lines instead of 480.This is quite a disappointment considering this is a production from the picture specialist IMAX. Comparatively, the movie Black Beauty offers a much better quality video with no jagged lines even when fast moving horses are shown.I even returned the CD to Amazon.com, but got no reply..."
5,MIND-BLOWING,"I've only ever seen 3 IMAX films and this is one of them. I was totally blown away by the incredible sound and photography. I had to study every shot because there is so much in it.It's not actually a movie like other IMAX films (such as Across the Sea of Time and T-Rex) but more of a documentary about how we are all islanders and how we live because the sea lives. It was surprisingly effective in this sense. My fave part was the discovery of the new underwater fish and the fish that had, what looked like, thousands of little lights flashing on and off.A scene with a boat fighting waves and crashing back down onto the sea was better than anything in The Perfect Storm. The sound in this particular scene is IN-CRED-IBLE.Whenever you pass by an IMAX check to see whether or not they are showing this masterpiece. You'll love it.The DVD is in DTS/Dolby 5.1 and is in fullscreen"
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"I purchased this DVD hoping it would relay information on coral reefs and the myriad of life living in them. While the focus of the movie was on the endangerment of the reefs due to global warming, overfishing, etc., most of the movie was spent above the water focusing on the the filmmaker and his wife and their trivial lives. The imagery was beautiful when they were under the water, but it's only a small percentage of film. Very disappointing."
5,Greatest IMAX I have ever seen,"Have you ever left a IMAX presentation that left you completely astounded? I have not seen this film in 4 years, but March 21 could not come soon enough. With a mesmerizing score by Sting, and great narration by Meryl Streep, not to mention underwater and aerial photography that would make David Doubilet jealous. A Must for serious DVD owners who want to truly enjoy nature in a beautiful visual and audible experience"
5,Haven't lived until you see the Living Sea,Very educational with impressive photography below the sea as well as a above. Another one of Greg MacGillivray's films that lives up to a fine reputation.
5,This is Duke at his best,This was the last great live recording Duke and his orchestra made prior to his death in 1974. Every one in the band just shines. I wore out my LP and had to buy the CD when it was finally released on that format. happy listening
3,"Very Important recording, but sad.","I do love this recording, but only for its historic significance. It is with sad regret that i listened to the concert and realized that Duke and the band at this point were showing a noticable lack of physical health and ability. Paul Gonsalves, although still a very skilled player, just did not have the ability to pull off his classic solo stylings. Many of the other solists showed a similar deterioration. All in all Duke fares the best. This aside i still recommend this recording as it does show the influence of more modern jazz stylings. (i cant say i like the organ playing though) Any serious Ellington fan must buy this CD."
4,This magazine AND Sojourners,"This is a decent magazine and it's good to support an Christian magazine. But if Sojourners ~sometimes~ errors to the left- Christianity Today ~often/ persistently~ errors to the the ""right.""In the current climate, I subscribe to Sojourners. CT has been too passive in letting things veer to the right-wing.Contributor Yancey is an inspiration and a true Christian voice; while Colson is deluded by the high places of power and is a stain on an otherwise reasonable approach of CT."
3,Interesting but not as well researched as I'd like,"As a journalist, I catch too many content mistakes made by the writers for Christianity Today. Their articles are often not well researched. I would recommend ""Sojourners"" as a magazine with more interesting articles that push the contemporary Christian to think about the world and their place in it."
5,Clamp amp,The clamp amp is what it is. It works well with the 289 or any other fluke meter. not too much to say because it worked.
3,What's up with my DVD player,"The performance is good and so is the camera work. Unfortunately,I cannot view the entire show. Early in the second set my DVDplayer won't go any further. Also, I cannot view the bonusmaterial. I not sure what's up but, apparently my playeris not completely compatible with this format. That's too badbecause I really would like to see the whole enchailada.If I could I'd give it 5 stars. So be fore warned."
1,Purchase of CD,"I purchased the CD and it was delivered in the appropriate time, however the CD was blank. I was required to return it and bore that expense. While the company did refund the purchase price, it did not refund the cost of returning the item. After all of my efforts and expense I still do not have a serviceable CD. I would not order from this company again."
5,When's he going to write another book like this?!,"Probably the best & most succinct account of the ""pure myth"" school of thought regarding Christian origins that I've read. Detractors & other defenders of the the faith have predictably trotted out their usual lame & irrelevent arguments such as Mr Leidner being an Atheist(so?)& not trained as a religious scholar(and...?) I've yet to see a review by any religionist or ""classicly trained"" scholar specificly examining & refuting Mr. Leidner's factual analysis. He effectively exposes Christianism as one of history's most comprehensive & effective frauds. My only (minor) criticism is his dating of Mark as much later than CE 70-which has effectively been dated no later than CE 75 by most reputable secular scholars. Me? I'll readily cop to being an Atheist. Want to argue with me? stick to the facts or don't waste my time. Great book. On par w/authors such as Wheless,Doherty,Freke,& Zindler(if you can deal w/ the latter's bitterness & rage.)"
1,Dud,"The writer of this book is a person who is a well red amateur in the field rather than being a specialist. He is a free thinker who tries to suggest that the Gospels are not based on historical truth but are fictitious. The broad method is to suggest that a number of things suggest that the gospels are not historical. These relate to a lack of knowledge about Jewish customs and some other issues such as the geography of the area.It is then suggested that different parts of the gospels are a transcription of some aspects of the story of Joshua and that other parts are a reworking of the fate of the Jewish community in Alexandria under the Romans. (Some prominent Jews were crucified)The book is a rather plodding read. The main problem however is that the book simply relies on assertion to suggest the central thesis rather than anything else. There is no real explanation of who is meant to have written the material, their social background and the motives and mechanics of the process."
4,"african grey parrot handbook, mattie sueathan & dianalee deter","very informative. a grey is a very emotional bird, I did not know this. There is alot of things you really need to know before purchasing a grey and this book is a source of the best information of many of books i have read. Mattie sue has been in the business for years and knows the ins and outs of an african grey. a good read."
4,Good Care Book,"I found this book to be a good overall treatment for the care and feeding of African Grey Parrots and would recommend it highly, as there do not appear to be many such specific tombs that I have found, at least on Amazon. I would caution other readers/purchasers not to be put off with some of the overly cautious, and sometimes caustic comments, and perhaps be too scared to get one of these birds. The reader is cautioned so much that it is offputting at times and might lead people to say that raising one of these birds is impossible. To be sure, a new owner must be committed to being able to provide significant time and patience with one of these birds, but please do not be put off by all of the warnings. I am sure that is not what the author intended, but that is what came across to me, so please do not feel intimidated by some of the comments. These birds are incredibly good companions if treated with love and respect, and this book can certainly help the new owner in so many ways."
4,"Very good book, great overview of African Greys","As a new owner of a CAG, I found this book to be very insightful and interesting. It offers a good overview of African Greys and is a must-have for a new parrot owner."
3,Informative if you can get through it!,"This book has some good information, but on the whole I found it exhaustive and redundant. I was dying to read it, but after receiving the book it took a month to trudge through it. My husband, who is not as avid a reader as I am, did his best to start it but never got past the first chapter.Unfortunately, the book gives readers the impression that it is far more complicated and difficult to raise an African Grey parrot than it is to bring home and raise a human child. I was quite discouraged by it and almost wondered about my decision to purchase my Grey. Fortunately, though, I DID purchase him. Rather than being as intensely complicated as the book make it sound, he is doing quite well.Overall, I think the Guide to a Well Behaved Parrot (same author) was much more worth the read."
4,African Grey Parrot Handbook,Being a proud owner of an Afreican Grey this book is a good source of reference
3,"Nice book, but needs a little more depth to it","A good basic book to keep with you if your travel with out much planning. My only complaint about the book is that, after spending the night at several locations mention in the book, I got the feeling that not every location write up included a night's stay by the author. Just my two pennies"
4,Great Memory book,"This beautifully made srapbook is a great way to preserve your family history. In the front it has some space for family pictures and then it gives you enough space to write down all vital information about your family.It even comes with a preprinted family tree poster where you can add pictures, frame it and put it on the wall.Makes a great gift for any scrapbooking fan!"
4,Does the job,This gig bag does the job as intended and definitely keeps the instrument safe on my frequent travels. I wish i had gotten one that was easier to change the straps on the back to a book bag format as the 1-strap on it can lead to a pretty sore shoulder after some time.
4,"Awesome price for this nice of a ""gig bag""",This gig bag is quite awesome. it's very easy to carry around and it's so soft for my banjo! ha.If you don't want to spend the big-bucks for a hard case - this is DEFINETLY the case for you!
2,Vista certified? NOPE!,"This cam worked fine with XP, but now that I've upgraded to Vista, no more! I looked on the creative website and they have no plans of releasing Vista drivers for this device. Beware, Creative performs extremely poorly in supporting their products."
4,Not as good as my other one...,"I have a non-IM Creative Live Cam, and the video quality on that one is better. This one isn't horrible, but it's not as good as my other. Too bad."
3,fair product,"every easy to use, nice price. The reason I gave 3 stars is that I found several dead pix on the screen."
1,bad software. don't use for w2k older machine,"Installed on Dell precision 530/win2k/matrox. Installation freezes, video quality is poor, skype freezes. Shame on manufacturer. Selling such garbage should be called a thivery."
2,software sucks,"I don't want to install their bundled software, so when prompted I justchose to install the drivers, but guess what -- the setup program justfroze. Come on, how hard is it to write a proper setup? I should've letwindows hardware wizard to search the drivers on the CD instead."
3,"OK camera, great price","I bought this camera on another site for five bucks after rebate. If I had to pay the full price, then I probably would not have bought it. The camera is good in moderate to bright light. However low light (at night) picture quality is very bad. I have a Creative Webcam Live Pro for comparison, and under the same lighting conditions, that older webcam has much better contrast and detail. This one looks very dark and grainy (like turning up the ISO on a still camera). The software is ok, but I couldn't get the smart face tracking to work. I didn't have any problems installing on Win XP, and I mainly use Skype for video chat. At the price I paid, I am pretty happy."
1,Creative's own software doesn't work with their product,"This product would be great, except for the fact that the software and drivers provided by Creative, which makes the camera, DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY WITH THEIR PRODUCT! Their programs don't even detect the camera, and customer service is no help whatsoever.Additionally, their video drivers forced my computer into the Blue Screen of Death repeatedly and would not allow my computer to properly start.Garbage, do NOT buy. Buyer beware."
3,"Cheap, decent camera","Got it cheap so I can't complain. Quality is decent and it works as long as the lighting is good. A poorly lighted room will make the camera virtually worthless, so if you're in a darker room or one that has a lot of sun coming in (back lit) then you're gonna be disappointed."
4,Lansky Nathan's Natural Honing Oil,Product is acceptable for the use it was made for. price for quantity is higher than other similar products on the market.
5,Really good honing oil,Just what you need to finish off the blade of any thing you are sharpening. Lansky is a product you can trust.
3,as is,This works as is described. There isn't anything that I could say wrong about this item. It has it's purks.
5,Essential for Sharpening,"I sharpen our own kitchen knives using various stones and find that honing oil such as Lansk Nathan's to greatly assist in the sharpening process, rather than using, water for example as a wetting agent. It helps keep the metal bits from adhering to the stone, causing build up that can be frustrating to remove. I haven't found a good way to rinse off the residue without dirtying the sink making clean up messy and somewhat annoying. I may not be doing something properly in the process, so if any sharpening experts read this, they can help me by commenting."
4,Great Writing,"If one is to read Morris West today, this is the novel to read (as opposed to say, ""The Shoes of the Fisherman""). There are many ruminations on life and death and how individuals form and re-form faith. The work also contains numerous stunningly beautiful scenes and passages. Definitely, this is West on top of his form."
5,A Great but Complex Religious Novel!,"Blaise Meredith, a priest dying of cancer, is called on to serve as a Promoter of the Faith -- a Devil's Advocate -- in the investigation of the cause of sainthood of a figure from Calabria, one of the poorest regions in Italy. This is a novel of spiritual growth and self-discovery of the necessities of compassion. It's well worth your time, especially if you are in a spiritual crisis or generally having a problem understanding ""the ways of God to man.""I highly recommend this book. It reads well even after 43 years."
5,An Introspect On The Nature Of Sainthood,"World War Two - A village lost in the hills of Italy. A stranger that affects their lives. The basis of the plot seems almost trite and cliche, but the details of the characters - their desires and ambitions interpreted by the priest sent by the Vatican to study the life of a man that came mysteriously through their lives - imparting gifted wisdom and bestowing hope has been requested by the Diocese to be Canonized - the Pope was sent a ""Devil's Advocate"" - someone who challenges the very reasoning and seeks contrary evidence to show that the Bestowal of Sainthood is a far cry from the humble good deeds of a well-meaning soul - But was this man - a Saint?"
4,"Life without love, friendship and compassion is no life",This is a touching chronicle of one man's quest to find himself while trying to destroy another man's memory. The vatican has sent a Devil's Advocate to a small mountain town in Italy to investigate the life of an alledged Saint. What he finds is himself in the most unlikely of places. West has given us the insight into a compelling man and in so doing has given us a look at ourselves
1,my opinion is this book is boring,"My opinion on this book THE DEVILS ADVOCATE is boring. I've read other books by west, but none of them this lame. My opinion is this way because the title of this book makes the story sound interesting but it's not that interesting. It's kinda like a regular old story about a normal day life. In the beginning the story was boring,than, every once in a while during the rest of the book it would get interesting. But, overall ,the middle of the story, is the most interesting part of the book. Especially, when the doctor is approached by a stranger and asked him to be the devils advocate. So that's why my opinion is that the book is lame and boring."
4,A book to remember,"I read this book ages ago and I remembered it was very enlightening about the methods used by the Catholic Church, in the process of accepting or rejecting individuals being postulated for sainthood. Then I recently attended a representation of G. B. Shaw's ""Saint Joan"" together with a Mormon lady I was dating. As said play finishes with a mockery of the process by which Joan of Arc was accepted among the Saints, I wanted this lady to read ""Devil's Advocate"", to realize that the Church is very strict in this process and doesn't just go around handing out sainthood to whoever, in order to further their goals. I believe she was as impressed with the book as I originally was. It is very clear, beautifully written, interesting as it is full of facts and data not easily become otherwise and also very entertaining, even for someone who's native language is not English, like me. I thank amazon.com for having searched for months for this book, as it was already out of print."
1,Poor Quality,"I'm sorry to say my fascination with Longines watches quality has been shattered. My Longines broke down in its second year and after going through the trouble of sending it over to Geneva for repair it broke down again after only 6 months of use. I do not lead an overly active lifestyle or subject the watch to harsh conditions. Now I'm working on throwing (read: shipping) it back one way with a ""thanks, but no thanks!"" note."
3,So So,"You could use it if you like PS2 game on the road that much. In hindsight, it was a waste of money on my part."
3,False Advertising,"In some screenshots of the box, you can see where it says ""Supports maximum resolution supported by your PSP."" This is false. The unit's resolution is 480x234, which is also a tad greater than 16:9. The unit's power comes from the original PS22's power adapter, and can be switched off independently from the PS2. It also says it has ""brightness/contrast controls."" What it has is one brightness knob, possibly with contrast control combined in it. The screen leaves much to be desired, but as of right now it's the only one designed for the slim ps2. As the previous reviewer stated, the screen is slow, and text is hard to read. Not enough quality for the price.Also beware - if you use an optical cable for audio, make sure it's a low profile one. I use a monster optical cable and the connector is too big to get through the hole in the screen's base."
1,Game Glass company - poor service,The game glass was defective and I received no help from the company offering this item through amazon. I have had to go directly to the manufacturer to get service on replacing a defective product. This was a christmas present and my son has been unable to use it. I should have trusted my instincts and waited to purchase directly through game stop or eb games.
1,Very poor quality...so disappointed.,This is not the 'digitally remastered' quality I was expecting. It seemed to have been simply converted from a vinyl album into a CD.
4,Just what is advertised,"I got this penguin as a gift, paired with Sandra Boynton's book ""My personal Penguin"". It was perfect. My daughter loves to have the penguin 'read' her the book at bedtime. The penguin as finger puppet isn't the best, the hole for the finger is a bit large even for adult fingers. Overall this product is practically perfect in every way."
5,the cutest thing ever,my mom got it for me last year and it is still my favorite plushie. It is soft and super cute and I am a boy. It is so puffy! I have read a lot about baby emperor penguins. you should buy it.
3,"3 times the size of the other puppets- it is a hand puppet, not a finger puppet. It's head is warped.","I ordered 3 finger puppets: a skunk, chipmunk, and penguin. In the picture, the penguin looks the same size as the others, but it is 3 times as tall and 5 times as large. It is a hand puppet- not a finger puppet like it shows in the pic"
1,Crap,"In my opnion It's a completely crap because it is an ordinary scan! Searching, highlighting - particly everyone option doesn't work on Kindle. Be aware if you want to use it on your computer/kindle."
3,OK,It'll function for me. Best one I ever had was in Germany and gave it to a Polish friend before I left. Bought it in the Stars and Stripes bookstore. Can't find one like it anymore.
3,Polish - English,"This dictionary helped some with vocabulary. Polish is very difficult for this American to understand, even though I am comfortable with Spanish and speak and read a little German. I think a rudimentary knowledge of Polish is necessary to get full benefit from this book."
2,Immature,Snoops im just a baby boy is kinda retarded. it shows the immaturity of this rapper. I only recommend this item to people who like hearin boring music that doesnt make any since.
1,Surf Crap,"[[ASIN:1410707830 Surf Zombies]Mr Moore seems to have read a lot of obscure pieces of literature not readily accessible to the average college freshman.His stories are very sophmoric and poorly written.He has obviously plagarized from old episodes of ""The Twilight Zone""TV series and ""Tales of the Unexpected""comic book series.Wasted 13 bucks of hard earned cash on this crap.It would have been better spent on a six pack of Pepsi and a box of Ho Ho's.The favorable reviews you see here were all written by good friends of Mr.Moore."
5,How great is america,"Anna K is sooo hot. There is nothing better then just sitting down once in a while and watching this video. If your feeling down and out with what your life is all about, pop this video in and you'll feel better. It was coolBig Truck"
3,Anna helping me work out?,The only parts of my body that this gives a decent workout to are my heart (pounding whenever I see Anna) and my imagination.
5,"Good video, if you don't want to work out with it","I really like this video. It is the type of video that you need to watch, jot down the exercises, and do them else where. This is not a ""work out with Anna"" video. It is geared towards active people who need exercises to elevate their level of fitness. You should not buy this video if you intend to do it in your apartment. Nor is it a video for beginners.The music is not too bad. It is bearable. The workouts are clear, concise, and more importantly good. If you are a tennis player, or an active person, this will help you out a lot. Oh and if you are just a male Anna fan you will like the video, too."
1,I want my $$$ back,"This is the worst exercise video I have ever purchased. I was looking forward to getting a toned and tight body like Anna. She showed me the exercises to do, but that was it! I like the medicine ball exercises, but I don't have anyone to workout with at 6am every morning. Maybe I'll get something for it at next year's rummage sale."
2,An ANNAnonymous Sweat Tape,"Anyone who likes to see Anna's pretty smile, her ""... body"" ... ... or her charming manner - well...try NOT TO SEE this workaday, serious, business-like tape. To me (a real fan of her charms and sassy ways off-court and on her calendars), her drab workout was bland and routine. She never wore a second outfit, or gave us even one of her dazzling smiles (not one). Her voice seemed unappealing (she didnt persuade us, I thought.) You gotta have a gimmick, or at least some special quality. So Anna disappoints us here."
2,A predictable adventure,"In general it is a good story. But the good guys are very, very good ones to be mercenaries.On the other side the bad guys are very, very, very bad ones.As I said previously it is predecitable, in the last half of the book everything goes pretty simple, Bruce knows how to solve all the problems he encounters, also he gets the girl, the fame and the money. Like an African 007."
3,GREAT ADVENTURE READING,"A true adventure book which I found much more enjoyable than today's super-thrillers. This book was entertaing and held my interest the whole time. Even Clive Cussler fans might enjoy the change. Wilbur Smith seems to be the best adventure writer around. His books are entertaining yet plausible. Try ""THE DIAMOND HUNTERS"""
3,"Not his best, but a decent read","I am used to long, detailed, get the dirt out of your throat books from wilbur smith. this was not that. it was short, easy to read, but just o.k. I am a big fan of wilbur smith and always looking for a new book of his to read, this one is older, but if your a fan, give it a try."
3,Read only if you intend to read all of his books.,Of 28 of 31 of his books that I have read this is my least favorite. A totally unbelievable tale without the typical building of characters and romance so often found in Smith novels.
5,Skiing,"My son is a skiing buff. He wanted to learn more about skiing in the US, so he purchased this book for that information. He enjoys reading it."
1,Painfully Slow,I have been using the SONY 2 GB microvault classic with excellent results. Since I was very pleased with the 2GB microvault - I decided to upgrade to the 4GB model. I gave the 4GB Microvault a one star rating for one reason. Transferring files to and from the unit as well as deleting files off it takes incredibly more time using the 4GB model than with the 2 GB model. I ran many tests between the two units and here are some results: Transferring one folder of files to the:4GB - 21 minutes2GB - 1.75 minutesDeleting these same files off the:4 GB - 11 minutes2 GB - 25 secondsThese results were typical with all the testing I did. All testing was done using the same computer with all procedures being equal.I was able to return the 4GB Microvault - with a renewed appreciation for the 2 GB model.Sometimes....bigger is not necessarily better.
2,4GB Micro Vault Classic,"I purchased the Sony because I need dependable media - I have had problems with off brands. This drive seems to save and hold data correctly, however it is extremely slow in transfering data. I have a Micro Vault 512 Mb that works great (with either USB 1 or USB 2). For some reason this 4GB drive can take 1/2 hr to transfer about 100 Mb of data - it should have only taken a few minutes. I have tried this new drive on 3 different computers and on both USB 1 and USB 2 but it doesn't seem to make a difference."
2,Sony is total Bologna,"I purchase a little 8gb Micro Vault today. It was on sale at Circuit City so I thought I would give it a try.The first thing I saw after I opened the box up was that, unlike the misleading photos on the Amazon web site, there is virtually nothing on it to allow it to be clipped to anything. No keychain, no type of hook. nothing. It would just have to loosely dangle in ones pocket to transport it and would be real easy to lose if I can't hang it on a small clip when not in use.The other thing is that it really is slower than other flash RAM that I have.Sony keep falling and falling and falling into an abyss of proprietary , lower quality hardware, worse warantees, and stupid ideas. They are soooo out of touch.Jon"
4,A book that tackles the theological problems of the OT. God.,"If one reads the Old Testament carefully- one begins to wonder about the nature of God. He frequently kills people, changes his mind and severly punishes His ""chosen people."" This book deals with these theological problems and and responds with a historical analysis of the Jewish Bible. The OT is definatley written in layers, and by looking at the oldest layer (called by scholars, the Book of J) one can see that this depection of God might have a different message."
4,Feel like a Zombie Tonight!!!,"Brad Gooch has been a favorite writer of mine for a few years. His latest book is a departure for him, and a wonderful one at that. This is a fable about ""Zombie"" a wonderful young man searching for his destiny. His adventures lead him to New York City and even to Haiti. Some of the scenes he enters into are pretty wild, shocking and abusive, with homosexual S/M thrown in. I had the feeling I was reading one of Dennis Cooper's books at times. Gooch's prose is written so intelligently and with such perfection, and his character's seem so vivid and real, it feels like you are reading a classic novel. I really enjoyed this novel, it was so different in story line and very original."
2,Gotta disagree ....,"I loved his first two novels (and could not be bothered to even read the ""boyfriend within"" thing). Anyway, I was hoping for a lot more. This is well witten, but just does not seem to go anywhere."
5,The Inspired Heart -inspiring!,Jerry Wennstrom has written something universal and transformational. I could not put his book down. It is a quiet book with a powerful message.
4,Good Beginner Product,"This is an easy to use product that provides a useful, basic framework for common Swhahili phrases as well as a broader understanding of sentence structure. The user can expand his or her vocab on his own and use this program as a foundation for becoming more conversational.This is not a program that, by itself, makes one conversant in Swahili. Instead it is a beginners' guide that works well for preparing for a trip to Africa."
3,VERY GOOD LEARNING AID,"When I ordered this audio course I had one specific problem: I had tried to learn kiswahili based on traditional methods for many months, but the effort had proved well above results. The language is really quite difficult to learn and activate.The audio course did the trick. It is made up of 30 minutes lessons you can listen to anywhere (I usually do it while I drive to the office in the morning) effortlessly remembering new expressions and constructions. Only nag, 10 lessons cannot do much towards gaining an in-deep knowledge of a language... So I guess I will have to go for the next audio course.Also, it is worth pointing out that I had a base of kiswahili grammar prior to this course. It might well prove difficult for a person with no idea of the grammar structure to learn without actually acquiring any knowledge of the mechanisms behind the spoken language."
2,Very repetitive with an unusual focus,"I was disappointed by the dialogues in this CD. They endlessly repetitive (say one word at a time, three times, then two words together, several times, then three words together, several times, until finally you say the whole sentence; repeat the whole process at least five times, at the beginning and end of the lesson....and so on. Also the dialogues seem to have one main theme: teaching the non-Swahili speaker how to invite someone out for food / drinks. I would imagine most tourists have an interest in doing something other than this, so I couldn't understand the singular focus of so many of the lessons."
1,pimsleur swahili- I never got my product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered, it was shipped, I guess, and I have not received it. Where is it??????????"
2,Not very cozy,"This bean bag cover is adorable, but it is basically filled with packaging peanuts. It is hard and uncomfortable and the ""beans"" squeak when pushed on. We ended up emptying the whole thing (and re-using the beans as packaging material) and spening an extra $50 to refill the cover with regular bean bag filling. Now it is great, buy don't buy this for your child to snuggle with unless you are willing to spend extra on new filling!"
3,A fantastic debut into the world of fiction!,"Michael Shockey's debut thriller, ""Seized"" is absorbing!!Penning a complicated plot with twists, and turns along with a true to life burden of one's emotional past and mental suffering, Dr. Shockey forces us [his readers] into the lives of two very special people.Between the central characters resides a love that is so strong, it is the only glue that can ""possibly"" hold these fragile lives together. It is a love that I have not seen expressed so vividly and profoundly in quite some time.""Seized"" also attacks and demands of its readers a hard look into the realities of mental disorders and personal fulfillment's. Why must one suffer, and how far is one willing to go to get what they want?If you are captivated by intrigue, suspense and mystery, and have a yearning for sincere love, then seize this opportunity to purchase this book.Read Michael Shockey's ""Seized."" It is a book about love; it is a book about mystery; it is a book about life."
3,Not what I Hoped !!!!!!!!,Sorry but I Hatted this book . It was just so sad I did not want to read it till the end . But I did Poor Careen she Loved Ted all the years and he was such an ASS to her every time..Yup Ted was a real MR. Nice Guy ...... I am so glad that the book is done .Save your money .
3,Somewhat Boring,"The DVD is okay. After two songs, though, my 17 month old was bored and lost interest."
2,Scratched Disc,The disc we received was VERY scratched and had crusty stuff on it. We had to clean the disc and use scratch repair before playing it. The DVD is ok. Not great. My four-year-old was not too interested even though he loves Thomas.
2,Boring,"My 18 month old will not sit still to watch this one, and he loves most of the others. The music is very slow and boring and the picture is very dated. Use your money for one of the other DVD's."
3,It is Skinner,Skinner isn't always easy to read but this books is worth reading. If you have questions about VB this is the place to be.
3,Verbal Behavior,"Book was in pretty good condition, considering its age. For content, you can't beat the old standards. Sister-in-law was thrilled to get it."
3,Good film not great,"After watching numerous movies staring Ti Lung you tend to get familar with his choragraphed fighting style movies like Avenging Eagles, Blood Brothers, and Sentimental Sword are just of few of the great ones. This one has a fair story yet plenty of fight scenes but not at the high level that I know Ti is capable of doing."
2,Ti Lung stars in dual role in minor kung fu epic,"This Hong Kong kung fu film from 1979 offers a more complicated cross-generational plot than usual as a group of children seen in a prologue and flashbacks reunite, all grown up, to get revenge for crimes committed against their parents. Star Ti Lung plays both a father and his grown son in separate scenes. Although the English dubbing is terrible, there is a very nice score of original Chinese music. The photography and set design are above average, although the plot does get confusing. It all culminates in a big, gimmicky battle in a palace as the grown children take on evil master Wang Ching (a perennial villain in these films). Other kung fu greats in the cast include female star Hsu Feng and high-kicker Tan Tao Liang."
2,Arnold Vosloo fan reviews The Revenger,"I bought this movie through Amazon because Arnold Vosloo was in it. For any Vosloo fan you should at least rent it. It's nice to see Arnold in any movie, but he is only in it for about 15 min-the story line isn't bad. A sax player meets up with an old friend(Arnold)and unknowingly gets into his troubles and tries to get his life back."
2,Vosloo fan reviews the Revenger,"I bought this movie from Amazon because it had Arnold Vosloo in it. It's about a man who meets up with a friend(Vosloo)and it changes his life. Unknown to the main character his long lost friend is up to his neck in trouble with a crooked man. He spend most of the movie trying to get his life back. Not a bad movie, but Arnold is only in it for about the first 15 minutes. A must have for die-hard Vosloo fans. It's one of his first movies-89."
2,Hello Kitty Freaks,"My daughter is a Hello Kitty freak, and just HAD to have this costume for Halloween. While it was cute, I found it to be cheaply made, and not true to size. the top was very tight for a girl who normally wears size 7, and the bottoms were huge - we had to safety pin the waist. After a brief wearing to a costume parade, the stitching on the crotch of the pants went out, and the tie for the top had ripped off. I found myself re-sewing half of the costume after an hour of wear, so that she could wear it on Halloween night."
4,Beverage Cooler,This is a very nice looking beverage cooler. I bought this as a wedding present for a friend and have heard nothing but good things so far.
3,"Nice quality, but very SMALL","It is a nice wallet and gift box, but is smaller than it appears -- it is only about as tall as US bills are. With more than a few bills inserted, it will bulge open with the bills visible and possibly flush with the opening. I like this wallet style, but it needs to be a little taller. Unfortunately, this one is going back."
4,nice but small,"nice quality, beautiful box (for a gift)would be nice if it were able to accommodatebigger IDs (European passport size)"
5,Stylish and Durable,"This wallet takes the cake. I haven't seen many wallets around that are anywhere close to the quality leather you get with Hilfiger, the leather still smells fresh a month after receiving it!The thing comes in a classy gift, which I had no need for but made you feel like you are really getting something special, and you are. Plenty of storage for cards and all that and the photo space is flawless."
3,WAY OVER PRICED,So it's leather and so it's a Tommy Hilfiger...big deal. Construction is average when compared to a Rolfs or Buxton wallet...Certainly not in the league of a Coach wallet; average size and storage space...nothing to write home about...I wouldn't buy another...
2,Cheap Wallet,I bought this wallet for my husband's birthday and the day he opened it we discovered that the wallet is really cheap. It rips pretty easily and it is difficult to fit many credit cards (it is even harder to remove the cards after you shove them in). Also this wallet lacks a big enough billfold for cash. It looks great and is priced nice but be warned it is a waste of money.
2,Not the right book...,"...for my 3 year old! I was looking for a book to teach my daugther manners and came across this book. This book is utilizes ""opposites"" - it puts good behavior and bad behavior side-by-side as a teaching tool. My daughter is apparently too young to comprehend it and I just feared, like the other reviewer, that she would pick up bad manners because she really can't tell teh difference... maybe when she's older."
3,Actually gave my toddler ideas for bad behavior!,"The book is a very long read for a toddler, so you need to break it up into a couple sessions. Some of the cartoon strip examples actually gave my toddler ideas for poor behavior. The name calling at the birthday party story is kind of funny, so my 3yr old picked up on the humor and has been using it at school (not acceptable!). I think this book is for a child who already has an understanding of manners."
2,Too old for toddlers,"Although this is a very nice book, it was too abstract for my 2 and a half year old. The illustrations are very complex and busy and too much for a toddler to comprehend. I think a late three year olds and four year olds would be better suited for this book."
5,This book was awesome....,"I read this book for the first time when I was about 8(I found it in my parent's bedroom and snuck and read it under my bed and in the laundry room).Feinberg was such a superb writer,bravely tackling the issue of AIDS and introducing it to the public from a first person kind of view. I was saddened that I didn't get a chance to read his work until 5 years after his death. This novel was ironicly hilarious, devastating and powerful. A work of pure genius."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!,"Mr. Feinberg's words are spectacular. The reader is certainly transported to another time and place . Sometimes the place isn't where one wants to be, however, one learns how a person copes with living with HIV.I laughed, cried and worried throughout. I believe this book is good for anyone to read and I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a clue about HIV.Enjoy!!"
2,"Banal, hyperbolic and, in the end, tedious","I found this book remaindered and, seduced by the breathless reviews on the back, decided to give it a try. It may be bad form to criticize this last book by a writer who succumbed to the very disease around which the subject matter revolves, but I'm afraid that's what one must do to be honest.It's surprising that someone of such obvious intelligence could write a book that epitomizes Fran Lebowitz's remark that one should not detain a fleeting insight. Most of the essays cry out for the patient pen of a competent copy editor, and there is very little here that hasn't been said with more grace, insight and craft elsewhere. Fans of Feinberg's novels will no doubt want to investigate this, but the self-indulgent prose and pretense to outrageousness will probably get old fast for almost all other readers."
1,It sucked,These people do not know how to sing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Don't Bother.,"If you like and want good celtic music this is not the CD for you.Try Silly Wizard, Jiggernaut, Wolfstone, Rawlins Cross, Natalie MacMaster or such. Every song on this album sounds pretty much the same, no real musical talent, no cranking fiddle solo's etc. Pretty much pablam for the masses just like you can hear on any top 40 popular radio."
4,hand puppets,"I bought this hand puppet for my grandson who asked for an ""unusual"" stuffed toy. He loves to create little puppet shows with his other stuffed animals so this was the perfect toy for him. He loves it."
4,A Breton version of Afro-Celt Sound System.,"The album does for French/Breton music what the Afro-Celt Sound System does for traditional Irish. There's good vocals, bagpipes and bombarde with hard driving techno rhythms. This is Alan Stivell at the techno-dance rave. Not everybodies cup of tea, but if you like Irish/French-Canadian/Breton music that is new and different, try it out."
5,Fabulous,"This is my favorite CD of Beethoven Violin Sonatas. There also was an excellent CD by the same performers of Sonatas 4, 7, and 8. What is even more startling is that these are live performances. Emmy Verhey's technical perfection is absolute. Her tone is full if not fat, and her articulation is effortless. Tempos are slightly brisk, but everything flows smoothly. This is music making without eccentricity. If you never have heard of Emmy Verhey, she recorded the Brahms Double Concerto with Janos Starker and Arpad Joo, winning Starker's hard won approval. Her pianist, Carlos Moerdijk, is a fine chamber musician, playing with subtlety and grace, never failing to match the mood of his partner. Despite these being live performances, the recorded balance between violin and piano is absolutely perfect, and the overall sonic picture is very pleasing. Do not be deterred from acquiring this because it is an obscure recording. You never will hear better Beethoven."
5,A worthwhile investment of your money,"Ms. Frutchey's book is an absolute must for anyone planning on starting (or perhaps just thinking about starting)their own editorial consulting business. She's been through it all before, and is passing along the good, the bad, and the potentially ugly of everything involved. Her book can help anyone navigate more easily through everything from setting up an office to negotiating fees and getting insight on just exactly what the client wants you to do. She has provided an essential timesaver by reporting truthfully on what she's been through, and what you can expect. This book also contains many helpful references and websites for more information, help, and job leads. She's done her homework, and it shows."
2,Overrated and quietly arrogant,"I know that many find this book to be very special and I freely admit the writing style is engaging. That being said, the reader is left with the distinct impression that there is more work to becoming a surgeon than any other profession in the world, especially medical profession. I'm not an M.D. myself, but this book is a slap in the face to any family physician, pediatrician, or cardiologist, who have their own unique sets of pressures that a surgeon couldn't possibly understand. The Making of a Surgeon contributes to the public perception that a surgeon is a higher ranking physician than a primary care doctor. I commend the surgeon that treated a problem I had, and certainly appreciate it. But when it comes to followup, listening to me, and on a scientific level, balancing out all of my medical problems and history, there is nobody that works harder and puts in more time than my family doctor."
5,new album,super cat is and will allways prove to be the best voice in jamaica. he have a natural talent and I fiel he is wasing what he got... sean paul is getting rich with super cat voice he imitates. please is you contac super cat make him now that he got to get in the bussines I give my BIG RESPECT TO SUPER CAT THE DON DADA AND WILD APACHE. MAKE MORE MUSIC FOR IS FANS
5,Hope Amazon Offers Style Again In All Sizes,"These are beautiful glasses, just realize the top is a little small for hand-washing. Would like smaller versions. Hope these become available again, especially in an old-fashioned or 12-oz size. Have not been able to find them elsewhere. Please bring them back!"
3,"Side-splittingly funny, but needs editing","I really like the two books about the legendary defense attorney John Wilkes. Wilkes on Trial is a fast, focused read that goes by quickly. This book is even more absurd and flamboyant than Wilkes on Trial, but because it really is a rolling narrative of loosely connected cases, it gets a bit long. I'll never forget the episode where Wilkes is thrown into The Tombs and quickly assumes the role of a PLO terrorist during a riot in the prison, but that was the funniest part of the book and it occurred in the first 100 pages.If you really like high farce and low satire, ala Daniel Defoe, then you'll love this book and I have not given it enough stars. If you want to experience fictional broadsides against our justice system, you'll also like this book. I just wish his editor had dropped one or two of the cases covered and made this a shorter book. I love the first half, but found the second to be too much rehash."
4,very enjoyable,i really enjoyed this book. i found the characters memorable. some incidents were slightly hard to believe but all in all a good read
3,MUST READ FOR RESIDENTS,"I LIVE IN NEW FAIRFIELD CONNECTICUT. THE SITE OF CANDLEWOOD LAKE. I SO ENJOYED READING ABOUT THE PLACES I SEE DAILY. SOME THNGS HAVE CHANGED, BUT ANYONE KNOWING NEW FAIRFIELD WOULD CERTAINLY ENJOY THIS. I'M SO HAPPY I FOUND THIS ON AMAZON, IF NOT FOR THE TITLE I NEVER WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT."
4,Candlewood Lake,"Very good book, great story line only a little too descriptive in the beginning.Lots of twists.Makes you yearn for it to be even longer."
4,Small town life,"Review: In a small town in Connecticut three children become best friends. Eve, Billy and Justin remain true to each other until they graduate. Then Billy's mother dies and Eve feels that Billy needs her more so they get married. Justin, who has always love Eve, moves to California so he doesn't have to be constantly reminded of what he lost. Eventually he meets a woman he falls in love with, but she is stricken with a fatal disease. He then moves back East, and when Billy runs off with another woman, he is there to console Eve. After a series of misunderstandings, Justin & Eve finally decide to marry.This is a very will written story and holds your interest from beginning to end. I highly recommend this book."
4,solid and affordable,"I have been using these controllers for over a year without issue.Pros:1. Less costly than other competitive products. (at least where I purchased them)2. The buttons and joysticks have survived use and abuse better than the original Sony wired controllers.3. Reasonable operation over distance.Con:1. Not always predictable which controller will be ""player 1"" when activated.Note: It is worth using good batteries (~2200mAH) as this makes operation over distance better. Also, 2.4GHz is a realtively common frequency for home electronics devices. Too many devices operating at this frequency could complicate use."
1,Worked great for a month,"This is my second set of wireless controllers for the PS2. This set worked great for about a month, then they would lose their connection to the receiver. New batteries, but no joy. Now they only work intermittantly. These are going to the landfill."
3,an ok resource,"I had this book as a text in a school counseling program. I didn't find this particularly relevant to my job as a counselor. With that said, for a teacher or aide who works directly in a classroom all day every day I can see where this would be a useful resource."
4,This was a trip down memory lane for me,"As a teenager I had this recording in LP format. It contains the tune April in Paris. Bill Davis wrote the arrangement of April in Paris for the Basie Band, that became such a hit for the Count. If you remember, it contains the comment, ""One more time"" and ""One more once"". Davis uses that in this recording.Sixty years or so later it sounds dated, but I have to realize that this was the style of jazz I grew up with. It took me many years to finally find this in CD format."
5,Like a journey back in time . . .,"Every bit as good as Vol. 1. Excellent video and sound. Terrific for party background entertainment on your big screen TV--they'll be standing in front of the ""bandstand"" applauding."
4,HI Pig,It's a plastic pig... what do you want? The lei did fall appart within 10 minutes but it was easy to repair with a needle and thread in another 10. She dances well!
3,Just the Basics,"This is an excellent book for the absolute beginner who doesn't plan to go beyond the basics. The beginning shows an number of simple techniques. All the projects involved use these techniques. Most of them look very 70's Rit-dye-and-rubber-bands. I found the projects to be fairly repetitive. Some of them involve sewing. The instructions are clear, though, and the introductory techniques section is helpful."
3,Not what I expected but it is OK,"I already new about most of the party ideas from tea parties I attended. I wanted something to make mine special. In generel, it is OK."
3,full of nice ideas but no real substance,This is a nice book providing a lot of ideas for creating your own tea party. there are no photos of the finished recipes which i would have liked. she doesn't provide all the recipes either stating you can find them in any old cookbook.
2,No Joshua Bell Here as Advertized,"If you are looking for a video to watch and listen to Joshua Bell perform this DVD is not it. Joshua Bell is interviewed for about 1 minute and plays very little. The interviews of people attending the School of Violin are excellent. Joshua's Mom is also interviewed and is very interesting. The students do play a couple of pieces which are excellent, but this is not a musical video. I guess I was looking for violin concerts, with special features of interviews from the artists. To watch Joshua Bell grace a Violin is unbelievable! He will literally stop you in your tracks no matter what you are doing at the time! So I am still looking for some of Bell's videos."
4,Interesting Documentary,Thoughtful but jumpy documentary. Ended abruptly and the title was the only clue to why this was all put together.
4,"Great for the price, but runs small","Rabbit Skins are great, featuring nice, bright colors, and 100% cotton. But make sure you buy at least one size up, because they run small and shrink."
4,Nice t-shirt but runs SMALL,"Soft yet thick material, good color, good proportions (sleeves not too long and neck is just right-sized) but the overall sizing runs small."
3,A little too negative,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but to be honest I haven't been able to get through it. I really enjoy Bernie Goldberg's point of view and listening to him on the O'Reilly factor. However, I found reading this book very depressing and not very constuctive. Maybe when I'm in a better place, I can go back an finish it."
3,The book that never left the coffeehouse table....,"The author spends too much time pointing fingers at ideological opponents, complaining about the decadence of Hollywood, and cherry-picking racy, incendiary rap lyrics. Only a few times does he actually point fingers at people whose actions are actually causing America's decline. It's about as enlightening a read as the National Enquirer."
5,How They Are Screwing Up America,"I enjoyed reading this book, as I have with each of Goldberg's books.It was good to have this insight into how they have been messing up America. What Goldberg has written must be true or the people he describes would certainly sue him if it wasn't so."
1,Delusional,"To demonstrate the stupidity behind this book, one need only point out that, according to Bernie, the #1 person screwing up America is------Michael Moore! Not Dick Cheney. Not the corporate CEO's who are siphoning hundreds of millions from the corporations into their own pockets. Not the thieves at AIG and Goldman Sachs. Not the creeps who decided to attack Iraq after the Saudis attacked us on 9/11. Nope. The numero uno guy who is screwing up the country makes movies.I guess if you're a lying, thieving crook, it would make sense that Moore would be screwing things up by shining the light on your crimes. Otherwise....??????? Nutjob Bernie Goldberg has done it again!"
4,Easy Read but Sometimes Ilogical,"Let me just begin by saying that I'm a ConservativeGoldberg makes this book very easy reading with plenty of humor.However, he tries to make it appear as if he were not approaching the list from a conservative standpoint and is instead naming names on a purely decency level but seems to forget that on entries about people like Lee Bollinger who defended affirmative action. While I'm all against the practice, it's a wrong way to write a book by saying that you're neutral and start attacking for political reasons.Another fault would be that some of these people and their actions which got them listed are totally unimportant. Who cares if Barbara Kingsolver doesn't want the flag in her living room? Couldn't Goldberg find somebody else whose dumb actions did more damage?On the good side, this book appeals to the common sense in all of us and might be a great read for those looking to laugh at some of the nonsense that goes on in this country."
4,Conservative Comedy at its Best,"This list-style book is wildly entertaining. I am a moderate and I still agree with much of the content. Goldberg calls out liberal cowardice and even neo-cons on ignorant decisions and views on socioeconomic issues facing our nation. Just for fun, he even throws in some pop culture figures that are wasting our space.I recommend this for anyone who dislikes liberals, neo-cons, Hollywood elitists and anyone with a good sense of humor. Of course, conservatives will love this book.Genuine entertainment for anyone who is not an extremist or idealogue."
4,Michty Machines: Tremendous Tools,"I purchased this for my grandson's 2nd birthday. Both he and his 4 year old sister love this series - Mighty Machines. There is always one of them in their car, and near all the DVD players around the house. I would say that my grandson has watched one of the Mighty Machine DVD's at least once a day since his October birthday and it is now April! Very educational as well, without them even realizing it. They do a good job of breaking up the video so that the children do not become bored. It is something they could walk away from and then come back and not have to worry about missing a story line."
4,Intelligent trance - for a change!,"Skydive is a classic which is only now starting to get the recognition it deserves (through inclusion on Gatecrasher Global Sound System, etc). It's less accessible than your average cheesy trance song, but is ultimately more rewarding. I love the bittersweet, intelligently-written lyrics and the funky intro. One for the heart AND the mind."
5,great great great !,"How can i have ignored this stuff that long, this really sounds like something new in the actual musical landscape. reminds me some of the best u96 sounds, but with better layout. a must heard...nears creating a riot each time i play the cd ! sorry for my english....a+"
4,WingChun Legends,"Wingchun, one of the short, in-close fist styles of Chinese Wu Shu, has, like other Chinese martial arts, many legends associated with it. This book expounds and expands on a combination of several of them.The writing style is very cinamatographic in nature, and, at times, a little disjointed. It is, however, an engaging tale told in an action-oriented manner.It's certainly worth the read for anyone who may have the slightest interest in the martial novels that have a base in China."
3,Just OK,An OK book to spend a lazy afternoon away reading about one version of the origin of Wingchun.
3,I wanted to like it more.,"I have mixed feelings about this novel. I had fun reading it. I was happy that I got it, but...the writing was not so hot. It was obvious to me this was a 1st novel. The writing got better as it went along but there were entire chapters that read like a radio play. Chapters of nothing but exposition in a martial arts novel is hard to swallow.That being said the story, the characters and the history was worth reading. I envy Rene Ritchie's command of Chinese culture. I am glad he is committed to spreading the legends of martial arts. So in the end I would say this book should be supported."
5,An incredible album from an incredible woman,"She lends these songs a weight that they never had before. I mean, c'mon, you gotta give quite a lot of credit to a woman that can take trite song like ""Last Train to Clarksville"" and make it mean something to the listener."
2,wake me when the music starts,"I'll admit it: I don't ""get"" Cassandra Wilson. I've owned half a dozen of her albums. She doesn't sing a song, she breathes it. The backing bands are lethargic to the point of being comatose. Electricity is OK--it's that receptacle on the wall....The weird choice of covers, like The Monkee's ""Last Train To Clarksville""--why? I didn't like it when The Monkees did it. ""Harvest Moon"" was great when Neil Young sang it--I just don't see Wilson in a wheat field on the prairie. Hank Williams's ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" is one of the few tunes on this CD that does work. It's mournfulness perfectly matches Wilson's almost morbid delivery.Obviously Cassandra Wilson has a fan base. But after six attempts to get into her music, I've called it quits."
5,"WUL, YES-of course this is GREAT vibes herein and.......","NEEDS to be in any decent collection anymore.'Last Train....""? OUTRAGOUS!! boom da boomboom dee BOOM!Upstate New York,to boot,ey?Bearsville.Man- what a beautiful GIFT this woman posseses.WANT MORE PLEASE!!Her newest one is REALLY her best so far,imo.Gettum all! Check out the Jamie Cullum ""TwentyFour Something"" jams too!! WOW!! A La HOT!!Karyn Allison...and Ben w/ The Medicine Wheel.Jean-Luc Ponty?YES!!"
4,"dreamy, unexpected, every song a unique interpretation","I own this and Glamoured, and love them both. Her covers of familiar songs always bring something new. What an eerie, moody, individual stylist."
1,Has not begun...,Seems like a long time but the subscription has not started...wondering if there is a problem. 4 more words required??
3,tv novelas,I really havent read much but i like the oictures and also i havent reccived my magazines so i am nig able to say much
1,Why is this magazine publisher spamming me with unsolicited subscriptions,"Let me clarify: I am not a Spanish language speaker. Yet, suddenly I started receiving TvyNovelas magazine without making a subscription. Even worse, soon followed unsolicited subscriptions to Spanish Cosmopolitan and Vanidades. I discourage you to make a subscription, this magazine (or any of the others) is not worth your time - their spamming practices are unacceptable."
5,CHEAP,"Cheap textbook, and a big refund, and i can send it back for more money, i am one happy college student"
5,Review for Algebra Book,The algebra book was in the condition specified and I recieved in a timely manner.
3,masters of horror don coscarelli,i love this film all masters of horror aint bad. showtime stills air them on friday nights at 10.00 pm central time.this eposode i love the twist at the end.
2,Not very good...,There are so few good movies on this. The story line were half developed and the budgets were poor. Overall not worth it.
2,Lots of blood + Almost no suspense + Some Scary Scenes + Quite a few original plots = Worth renting,"Most of the shows of this series contain gory scenes. The majority of the plots are original to me. For example in ""Home Coming"", soldier zombies got out of their coffins to cast votes against the Iraq War! It's entertaining but not scary or suspenseful.There are 2 bad things listed below.1. There are only about 3 suspensful and scary scenes in all 20 shows!For example in ""The Right to Die"", the male character was in the bath tub by himself. Suddenly, he saw his wife appeared right in front of him. What happened next was very scary to me.2. All of the shows have many extremely logical holes that make them ridiculous. It's really disappointing.In short, they're worth renting but not buying. I prefer Tales from the Crypt. They're more suspenseful even though their special effects are below par."
4,Not Nightmare-safe,"I remembered watching this a few years ago when it was on SHO and literally just had bad feelings while watching it. Not sure why I did. I am not a horror movie person.I ended up watching this series over a period of a few months. Some episodes I was able to watch, some not so much. The thing that one has to keep in mind is that from this series, whatever gets you into horror, this series will challenge you over different episodes. So, if you are into the beyond but hate slashers, get ready, you'll likely be confronted with both in one. Or, if you like law enforcement and sex but don't like supernatural ... there's that other episode for you.This series is set up to challenge everyone's tastes. It will succeed in some respects, and fail in others. There are some episodes I have actually avoided seeing again after seeing them the first time a few years ago on Cable."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"More than 50% boring. First episode where I've fast-forwarded parts. The only cool part is when the girl hits the stupid singing guy with the plank of wood. Oh and the fact that she actually sets traps for the killer who's chasing her, that was something the trailer didn't imply. I thought this was going to be one of the dullest of the series and it is."
2,not scary at all,"I expected an intense collection of scary horror stories or at least great psychological suspense thrillers. These are mediocre and at times simply comical stories much like twighlight zone or tales from the crypt. Entetaining at best, scary...not in the least. I'd hardly call this horror. The service and shipping provided was great and the packaging is very appealing for a collection, but certainly not a scary set of ""horror"" as I had anticipated."
3,Anchor Bay has always been known for double-dips!!!,"C'mon people... I know that double-dipping sucks for the consumer, but this is nothing new. Anchor Bay has always been known for their double-dips! I can honestly say that ARMY OF DARKNESS holds the record for the most double-dipped title, and most of these were done by Anchor Bay. The company milks their cult favorites for all they're worth, and they're not going to stop as long as money is made.I'm glad that I held off from buying the individual releases. My only complaint, however, is that the box set is a little too BIG. It takes up a forth of a row on my DVD shelf. The ""crypt"" could've been designed half the size and still would've worked fine. Sure I could've bought the two volume sets instead, but I really wanted that extra disc. I know... I know... but I'm a bonus feature nut!"
4,Happy with slightly defective item,"The product was very affordable, although slightly defective- the ""mausoleum top"" fell apart as soon as the plastic wrap was removed. All in all, i am happy with this purchase."
4,this movie was pretty good,this movie/Eposide was pretty i just don't get why he kept on having sex with jennifer for that was the most nasty parts. but other then that if you love good movie this is one to buy or rent but beware if you rent it on blockbuster it be long wait trust me. but this one is must see
1,Yawn,Of all the horror series ever done for TV I was having high hope for this one. Unfortunately it came in as extremely lame.
4,Very Good Compared to Most of the MOH Series,"Overall I have been very dissapointed with the MOH series on a whole but did find this installment a breathe of fresh air. The only one I really enjoyed was ""The Black Cat"" up until now. ""Incident on and off a mountain road"" was a really fun story for any horror fan. I realize this type of plot has been done many times before. But even if it isn't a new idea, if it is pulled off right it can feel very original. Thats how I felt with this one. The killer has a very creepy backwoods look that would definately freak out anyone. I certainly wouldn't want to catch this guy in the woods at night.I would definately recommend this one. Especially for those of you that search wide and far to find a mildly entertaining MOH installment."
5,A short feature based on a classic Lansdale short story?,No brainer. Joe Lansdale is the best living author working today. Buy it.
1,*NOT* DVI DUAL LINK CABLE,"If you need a dual link cable for 3D or 120HZ then DO NOT BUY this cable. The cable pictured here and in fact the cable you receive has the Dual Link pin configuration but the cable does NOT function as a Dual Link which is necessary for 3D or 120HZ refresh rate. The people who state this is not a Dual Link cable are right; those who state that it is, either work for the company selling this, or are not computer savvy enough to determine the difference. IT IS A SCAM! Notice the cost of the product is 0.01 cents making returning for a full refund more difficult because 99.9% of your payment is for ""shipping."" Don't get sucked into the same trap as I was; you were warned!As a side note, cable functions GREAT for a standard NON-Dual Link DVI cable..."
5,Surprised on how good the cable is!,"I wasn't expecting much of this cable due to the price because when you go retail for a dvi cable its almost always 25 dollars or more. This cable works great! The only issue I have is that it does not want to screw into place, otherwise excellent cable to have! Plus It fits very snugly onto the input so you don't really need to worry about screwing it in."
1,Awful build quality,The cables came in and the it appeared that someone held a lighter ofver the cables. They were burned down to the wire and have a black residue on the packaging. Dont waste your money on cheap products.
1,Didn't work,Turns out the product plug had the wrong prong configuration. The cost of the cable was relatively low and I concluded the $3.00 net after paying return postage wasn't worth the bother. Just another cable in the pile!
5,Helped Make 2 Components Fit,I purchased this a while back when I needed to fit 2 components together. This cable did this so all I can say is that it did its job.
5,Great Male/Male DVI Cable,"The cable works perfectly. We needed a DVI connection for better graphics on my wife's new monitor. No one likes the VGA cables that are provided with monitors. If you've never used a DVI cable, I encourage you to try it out and compare. Your picture will look much better."
4,Decent cable,"The cables work. They seem to be made of a smaller gauge wire than premium cables and the screw-in connectors are too short to secure the cable to my monitor. For the price, I am not going to complain."
5,Clearer Connection,"Heavy duty cable connects to computer with a digital connection. Slightly better clarity than using the older style analog cables, but your computer and monitor must both have these types of connectors."
1,SCAM!,"What a scam! The advertisement says 4/case, which I take to mean (4) 1-gallon bottles in a case. When you get to the site to buy, it's only one 1-gallon bottle. SuperThrive is great stuff, but I hate to be baited and switched!"
1,need more info on this dvd,"Before anyone spends any money on this dvd,we really need more info from Amazon.com as to whether this is a dvd full of interviews or matches and if it has matches why are they not listed."
5,City of the Living dead/ AKA: The Gates of Hell,"I was very pleased. I had not seen this film in about 20 years, so parts of it was like seeing it for the first time. It is still a great classic, deffinitly an 80's flick."
4,"Good, could be better","Fulci's work is often misunderstood. I for one, love this movie, but this one is not fulcis best. None of it made sense, but if youre a fan of his films and campy eurohorror flicks, you'll love it regardless. I love the ""intestine vomiting"" and ""drill"" scenes. Those are classic. Also, I liked the ""coffin rescue"" scene. The plot... oh I forgot, there really isnt one. But, thats really dosent matter with a Fulci film. You have to have an open mind to understand his work. Its not just about endless violence and gore, theres much more to it. The lighting in this movie got annoying...The soundtrack sounded like Zombie's, but it still had the same haunting qualities. Especially the acoustic guitar, that added to it. These movies dont scare me really, but Im just a big fan of the genre. Put down ""Scream"" or ""Haloween"" and go pick up a copy of this."
3,Will apeal to Fulci fans!!!,I have only seen this film under it's original title of ' City of the living dead'. It is'nt that bad a film but I would reccomend you find on uncut version in italian with english subtitles.
2,NOT THAT YOU'D EXPECT,"When I saw the cover and the name I thought it'd be something like ""28 Days Later"" or ""Resident Evil"". City flooded with crowds of hungry for flash cadavers. At this point it was rather disappointing for there is nothing like that in the movie. But there are many things familiar to Lucio Fulci fans: creepy and monotonous music, rather slow action, some gruesome close-ups and so on. If you really enjoy Fulci's films you'll enjoy this one too although maestro had much better - ""House by the Cemetery"", ""The Beyond"", ""Cat in the Brain"" for example. But ""City..."" was shot in the most creative period of Fulci's career so you'll easy put it at the end of the line of his best works. It's not bad at all, besides it has an infamous scene of intestines-puking which every gorehound I guess would want to have in his collection.My verdict - average Fulci's level."
1,City of the Living Dead (gates of hell),"This piece of junk, came out as ""Gates of Hell"" back in the eighties. It is an hour and half that can be spent watching a gulf game right on tv. The only reason that I can see, with new title, the owners want the confuse the viewer with adding the ""living dead"" in a an attempt to adding some viewers the greatness that Mr George Romero has. But dont be fooled, it was junk then, it is now. The italian horror industries is hurting bad, from movies like this one. It has a long confusing begining, then a middle and end confusing. ex. D. Argento movies. The only Gates of hell is the one turning as you go from spaghetti to the knob to turn Dvd off."
3,Abra cadaver,"Film director Lucio Fulci is an intersting case. On the one hand, his work is often very sloppy and slapdash. On the other hand, his films often boast individual scenes, shots and ideas that prove the man was not without talent. City of the Living Dead contains a goodly number of such moments, and is therefore well worth the time of Horror film aficiandos. All the usual objections apply: bad script, bad dubbing, no characterization to speak of, etc. But the film works as a collection of hallucinogenic moments (a supernatural burst of flame in an apartment, an apparition that causes people to weep blood, gusts of wind-swept maggots) of disturbing, dreamlike horror. He also manages to create and sustain an odd, nightmarish atmosphere throughout. And I love the fact that Fulci had the nerve to tack on a puzzling denouement that probably made no sense even to him. All in all, consider this film low rent, morbid magic realism."
2,BEWARE............................,Do not be conned by these prices the city of the living dead is avalaible in the walking dead fright pack box set................also by anchorbay entertainment. only 29.00 it also includes many other zombie flick by anchorbay.............
2,Poor amount of gore,"Being a big fan of this genre of films, and Lucio Fulci. I expected much more from this film and was sadly dissapointed. It is very slow to get started, and there is actually very small amounts of gore. Although the head drilling scene is horrific, and one of the worst scenes that i have evr seen in a movie, very little else happens. The film struggles, and for a Zombie film there is a distinct lack of zombie action. I am a massive fan Zombie, and have just purchased the beyond and New York Ripper, and of all the Fulci films, City of the Living Dead is a poor effort"
3,City of the Living Plot Holes,"The plot was pretty wild, a priest hangs himself and it opens up a portal to hell on Halloween.Not the kind of tradition zombies (Romero style) you might see. They were zombies far too powerful. They were super strong, like crush your skull with one hand strong. They could also give you a stare and make you vomit out your guts. They could also...teleport! WAY t0o powerful.One large problem was the zombie rules varied on the given situation. One of the leads was confronted with a zombie, closed his eyes hard, and it just disappeared. If this was an effective way to defeat the zombies, why didn't he do so again when confronted by other zombies? Inconsistent plot elements litter this film.The acting was pretty good though, as was the dubbing (it's an italian film).2.5 stars, based on plot holes as described above, and my personal preference for Romero zombies."
2,"""Not What I Thought""","Honestly, it's a Lucio film, But there could have been alot more gore & a better plot behind the movies depiction. In my opinion, this is definitly not Lucio's best piece of ""HORROR"". I say buy it to have as part of your Lucio collection, if that you are & view once. Enjoy!!!"
2,A tad disappointed......,"I love zombie movies. Don't get me wrong, I try to collect all of them. I took a chance on this one and bought it hoping it would be gory and good. It had gore in it, yes, BUT this movie reused the same way of killing someone over & over. I think if anything that is what bothered me most. Not that the zombies were "" ghost "", or the fact that the story line bored me. But the way the zombies would grab someone by the back of the head, and squeeze their brains out. Cool as hell the first time, but got old after the fourth."
2,More Ghost than Zombie,"I had heard a lot about this movie, but since Demons I've been quite cautious about Italian horror. This film only confirms that caution. I had heard that this movie was also H.P. Lovecraft influenced, but frankly I don't see it.Yes, the film does take place in a town called Dunwich, but that is as close to Lovecraft as it ever gets. Yes, some of the zombie makeups are good, but the plot of the movie is stupid, the zombies pop in and out of existence like ghosts, the film is more silly supernatural than scary Romero.Sorry, I still think Italian horror peaked with Barbara Steele and Mario Bava."
3,"Buckets of blood, heaps of guts, that crazy Lucio!","Fulci's follow-up to his enjoyable bloodbath Zombie(1979) is euro-trash sleaze on the outside but multiple viewings have revealed a surreal, scary horror film with a few good ideas, and dripping with gothic atmosphere. A priest hangs himself in Dunwitch, Mass and starts off a deadly chain of events leading up to the end of the world. Only gruff reporter Christopher George, and Medium-returned-from-the-dead Catherine McColl can stop the carnage. Some generaly haunting scenes such as when the priest's ghost appears just before someone gets kacked, and a little boy pursued by the spirit of his dead sister through the deserted streets. Once again, if you can't handle the gore, better stay clear. This features brain squashing, eyeball popping, intestine-barfing, head drilling, and a giant crucifix thrust into a guy's knads. Ouch."
1,Bad Advertising,This movie was misrepresented. I hope someone fixed this error so no one else will recieve the wrong movie.
4,OPEN THE GATES,I won't go into detail what this movie is about as i am sure other reviewer's already did. but what i am going to say is that this movie kick's @$$ were it needs it. good looking gore creepy atmosphere ( as in all or most of fulci's film) and an okay story. only one problem i don't understand the end????
4,What's With The End?,"I adore this movie, so don't get me wrong. What is with the end? It makes no sense really after this absolutely cool, scary and gory film. The plot in CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD is pretty concrete compared to things like MANHATTAN BABY...but then there is the funny and strange ending that drives me up the wall. I guess it's just meant to be left open to interpretation.Oh well."
4,brilliant,"In my opinion, this is Fulci's best movie. Sure, there are countless loose ends and events that go unexplained, but who cares? Like most Italian horror movies, it's about gore, not plot, even though there are some ambitious ideas in the script. Christopher George is an energetic presence here, and Catriona MacColl is well-cast and radiantly beautiful. The special effects--with brain pullings and head drillings--are spectacular and quite realistic.A word of advice: this movie is the same as the Creature Features print of ""The Gates of Hell."" This version is infinitely better, and even has some neat extras tacked on at the end."
2,Zombies from Where?,"Fulci's movies are, as i have now seen 4 of them, quite terrible. This film follows in the footsteps of ""The Beyond"" except that it is dragged through overkill by psycho babbling doctors who can't believe that the dead are eating people and stupid children running away from mind numbing zombies. The ending is one of those ""they are back"" endings that doesn't even make sense. The only reason to watch this if there are no drugs or alcohol in your house so you need a reason to fall asleep. Awful."
2,Lame would-be- shocker,"Whereas Dario Argento has managed to turn sheer brutality into a form of high art, Luci Fulci has to rely on brutality simply to disguise the fact that apart from it, there's - well, not much really. ""City of the Living Dead"" (also known as ""Gates of Hell"") is downright boring because all attempts at creating some gothic flavour or atmosphere OR suspense fail miserably. Instead, we're kept awake by repeated scenes of (badly made) intestines pulled out of something or somebody, and an electric drill forcing its way into (and out of) the head of a retarded boy! wow! Attempts at creating suspense (and keeping up the viewer's interest in the plot) are undermined by bad timing, editing, and worse acting. could have been high gothic gore, but it's just boring gore. silly. At least, ""the Beyond"" is better than this one."
2,Sub-par Fulci film,"""City Of the Living Dead"" is perhaps the weakest Fulci film in the gore realm, relying on some rather effective, suspenseful sequences to create more of a horrific ""moodsetting"" for the audience. While these suspense-carrying vehicles are fantastic at times (such as the premature burial and tomb-raiding scenes), much of the film's screen-time is spent on character studies that really have little purpose. The gorey aspect is at a minimal as well, where only the gut-vomit and head-drilling scenes are memorable. I also get tired of Fulci's extreme close-ups during dialouge between minor characters. Most of them can't even act!If you are an avid Fulci-fanatic, check it out! But to newbies, I recommend The Beyond with confidence!"
2,Cheesy...,"First of all, Lucio Fulci apparently has an eye fetish. He focuses on the eyes way too much and it starts to get ridiculously annoying further into the movie. The zombies in this movie aren't your run-in-the-mill slow walking, lagging, etc. They disappear and can reappear behind you or right in front of you. It's one thing to do a different take on zombie movies. It's another to ruin it. The only cool part of this movie is when this girl pukes up her guts. Gory, and a nice touch to a really bad film."
1,Don't Believe The Hype,"I like Fulci and believe he had talent, but this movie is pretty bad. In fact, there is nothing i like about it. It has some brutal gore, but what Fulci flick doesn't?Basically this movie sucks and is stupid."
1,Bad just bad,"This movie is one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life. The acting is terrible the gore is pointless and this isn't really a zombie film. Good story and atomisphire but it all leads to nothing, a confusing stupid ending (Fulci lost the origanal) and two gore scenes both are bad too. The gut puking started to look good then it shows a close up of her mouth in which her mouth is BARLEY open and some plastic cups resembling the guts fall out. The cheek drill scene is soso but the guy doesn't even scream he just sits there with his eyes closed getting drilled in the top part of his cheek and last one is a part of someone head getting torn out, the rest of this movie is so slow and the soundtrack is annoying. Bottom line this sucked."
2,What a joke!,"This movie is bad, bad, bad. Not even close to Romero's masterpieces. How can anyone give this film more than 2 stars is beyond me."
3,This City is filled with trash.......But I love it!,"I saw this back in 83 in a theater in Westfield{Rialto} and never laughed so hard.Its supposed to be set in Mass,but the accents are not new england.The dubbing is off and the screeching monkey in the background is a hoot!My favorite is the girl in the car who's eyes start bleeding and her insides some out through her mouth with a few belches.Lets face it folks any movie which has seven different titles to hide under is a classic! Christopher George seems to find these beautys to star in and may he rest in peace.I miss that man.The writer before me said it best about a classic gorefest.I love his other one too....Zombie."
4,City of the Living Dead Still has Teeth,"There have been many incarnations of this movie on VHS and DVD. Blue Underground's special edition is by far the best presentation. This one is definitely for giallo fans, and especially Lucio Fulci admirers. City of the Living Dead has all the outrageous gore staples, but it's the style in which the story is handled that really sets the tone for the creepy feeling one gets from viewing it. If you appreciate Italian horror and zombies this one is a no brAIner!"
5,An excellent if hard to watch entry from Lucio Fulci,"The first movie in Fulci's Death Trilogy, which also contains The Beyond and The House by the Cemetery, City takes place in Dunwich, Massachusetts, drawing upon the Lovecraft Cthulhu mythos. The gates of Hell are opened when a priest commits suicide by hanging himself in the church cemetery which somehow opens the gates of hell allowing the dead to rise. A team of young people, including Peter, a New York City reporter, Mary, a psychic, Jerry, a psychiatrist, and his patient, Sandra try to close the gates before All Saints Day, when the dead will walk through the gates and take over the living world. This movie contains the infamous ""intestinal hurl"" by Daniela Doria, who actually vomited sheep entrails for the scene."
5,Fulci's Best!,"City Of The Living Dead is one of the best movies to ever come out of Italy.John Morgen's performance in this movie tops the rest, The head drilling scene is classic. The film has a unique creepy feel to it and is very exciting. The way Fulci built up the suspense is Hitchcock worthy, Some may disagree but to me this film is very important. Many scenes in other horror films seem to have tooken a few ideas from City Of The Living Dead, It should be seen by every horror fan. Lucio Fulci deserves great credit for this masterpiece.Buy It! It will be a wise choice."
2,How could they end the film like that.,"Although this movie has some redeeming qualities, such as the atmosphere of suspense and the exceedingly well-done gore effects in some scenes for a movie of this period, many aspects of the movie were just plain irritating.""Zombies"" would appear out of nowhere and disappear right back into nothingness. Some cars have the steering wheel on the left, and some on the right. The characters are not characters - they are their lines (interestingly, I don't think it was the actors' fault, there).Finally, both the climax and the ending left much to be desired. Any film student (or gas station attendant, for that matter) could have thought up and filmed a better ending than we are presented with here."
2,way overated,I felt compelled to write a review because everyone rates this so high.this is one of the most boring movies ive ever seen.aside from the girl puking her guts and the drill through the head which i did enjoy a lot there is absolutely no other reason to watch this.i mean i like bad acting but this is so bad its like there too serious and there wasnt even any funny lines intentionly or not.anyway im just glad my copy was defected and exchanged for dario argentos deep red/tenebre which i think is a much better.anyway if you want fulci i would get the beyond/house by the cemetary collection because those are good in my opinion.
2,worst zombie movie ever,i bought this movie thinking it would be good probely was the worst zombie movie i have ever saw i want a refund
1,OVERATED AND WAY BORING,"THIS MOVIE WAS A HORROR DISASTER,I'VE NEVER WATCHED ANYTHING HORROR RELATED MORE BORING AND STUPID AS THIS FILM,BIG DISSAPOINTMENT."
5,Needed for class,"I have fallen in love with this book, even though I needed for a class I was taking. It is a compilation of stories that have opened my senses."
4,Met Expectations,The book arrived as expected in the condition that was promised. I already owned a copy of this book. This item was ordered as a gift.
4,Reading Entertainment at its finest,"The antics of Kim Claypool are enticing as she flitters back and forth from Amy's house to Evelyn's house - to Sparkies and the local bowling alley. There is never a dull moment in her life. This book is easy reading, and makes you want to read it until you figure out who is the culprit in the small hick-town of Fogerty. The only bad thing about the Kim Claypool series is that currently there is only one book - get off your butt Jean D. Erhardt and get the 2nd book written!"
2,same ol same ol,"Yeah I am a big fan of Onyx and after hearin Sticky Fingaz new cd (bootlegged of course) I knew (thought is a better word) that this cd was gonna be ill just like sticky.Surprisingly, I was wrong, after hearin mixtape played out ""Dying 4 Rap"", all I hear is average songs with so-so production. I wont lie, ""What If"" is a ok song, but i wouldnt listen to it twice. The rest of the cd is just average, ""Perfect -----"" is ok, but ""Electric Ice"", ""Big Shots,"" dont do anythin for me.Personally, I think he should have taken more time on this cd, it could have been one of the illest of 2001. Keyword, could have been."
3,3.5 Because It Has High Points!,"I bought this CD because I like Onyx. I don't really like the first single, but the remix is banging. ""Big Shots"" is another great song because there is an MC on there who sounds like B.I.G. ""Soldierz"" reunites Fredro with his cuz and fellow Onyx member, Sticky Fingaz to make a tight joint. ""I DOn't Wanna"" is a low point of the album because Fredro and Aaron Hall just aren't suppose to be together. ""Thug Warz"" is tight too. Track 5 and 7, ""Perfect B!tch"" and ""Who F#!k"" are redundant, neither shows any skills or good subject matter and they sound like all the other crap out there today. Overall, however, this album is worth buying."
2,firestarr?,I thought my boy fredro (from onyx) would have put together a better album then this.His lyrics are weak and the beats are R&B style.Also terrible use of guest rappers on this LP.Bottom line he gets two stars for two reasons 1. the song dyin for rap 2. because he was in onyx.This CD is a waste of money
4,Pretty Sweet,This cd is better than it has been rated...its got about 11 sweet songs. With What If topping the list. He cant compete with his cousin Sticky Fingaz new album Black Trash but overall its a pretty decent cd. If you liked Onyx...you will probably like it but i would buy Black Trash by Sticky Fingaz first.
1,GARBAGE A$$ RAP,"THIS IS A GARBAGE A$$ CD FREDRO STAR SUCKS AT IT, AND TO EVEN SAY HE SUCK AT ACTING TO. MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY COMING OUT WITH YOUR OWN CLOTHING LINE FREDRO AND STAY FROM BEHIND THE CAMERA AND SURE AS HELL STAY OFF THE MIC. I ONLY GAVE THIS CD ONE STAR CAUSE IT WOULDNT ALLOW ME TO NOT GIVE IT ANY!!!!!!!!!!"
1,WHACK,"WHACK WHACK WHACK YO THIS CAT REALLY SUCKS. IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT HE IS TRYING TO ACT--NOW THIS, HIS OWN WHACK C.D.I REALLY THINK THAT HE SHOULD DO EVERYONE A FAVOR AND KILL HIMSELF."
5,Thoroughly covers anything a non-specialized general interest reader would want to know,"With all the international turmoil and conflict that occurs in today's world, at some point you have to ask how exactly are these foreign policy decisions made? ""The Shaping of Foreign Policy"", in a new edition, hopes to answer those questions. With seven essays covering all of the basics of foreign policy - systematic, governmental, societal, idiosyncratic, and more. With examples illustrated such as the tense Soviet Union- United States of America relations and contributions by highly respected and noted diplomat Henry A. Kissinger, it really and thoroughly covers anything a non-specialized general interest reader would want to know, while being scholarly and academic enough for any college community library international studies collection."
4,"You won't put it down, I'll say that much.","Now. I would insert a summary here, but this is one you will simply have to read yourself. To make it short, John joins up with Tommy Oblivion and Shotgun Suzie to take a hop back in time, where they run into a lot of familiar faces from before they were familiar.The most fascinating part of this book is the fact that SO many things are explained...the only thing is, you won't realize they needed to be explained until they are. The twists were interesting, the surprises unexpected (and there was a lot that wasn't expected)...but the story's ending itself is what will make you either love or hate this book- and I'm not about to put it here!I will say I was disappointed. Not in the writing, but in a certain main character.If you've read the others, you already know you have to read this one, and you'll be left anxiously waiting for the next- if only to figure out how John will get himself out of THIS mess!"
3,Super Reader,"Not really as good as the last few, because it really breaks the fantasy-noir feel to go on a time travelling adventure, for most of it.John takes Suzie Shooter and Tommy Oblivion with him through time, to try and work out a way to stop the war with his mother Lilith.Along the way you get Arthur, Mordred, Merlin, Nimue, Father Time, and a rather meaner version of Herne the Hunter than previously.Lilith, of course, is still waiting for them, as the relationship between John and Suzie intensifies."
3,The review I did not want to write--3.5 stars if I had them!,"Usually, I can't put a Nightside book down. This time, I couldn't pick it back up. ""Paths Not Taken"" is a good bridge between the earlier Nightside novels where John Taylor does not know his heritage and the discovery that he is the son of Lilith. In this book, John, Tommy Oblivion, and Suzie Shooter go back in time to try and discover the origin of the Nightside so they can stop Lilith from eventually destroying the Nightside in the future. The first 200 or so of the pages of the book are slow-paced. We do find out how Merlin Satanspawn loses his heart. At the last when the action gets moving, the book is interesting. Pity it ends too soon and begins too slowly. Green does set us up for continuing interest in future novels. I do want to stay tuned just to see what happens between him and Suzie."
3,Getting better...,"Reading the books in this series is like eating potato chips. I know they're no good, but I just can't stop. I actually liked Paths Not Taken the best out of the series. This story takes the main characters out of the Nightside for part of the story and the change is refreshing.The main thing that has bothered me throughout the series is that all of the characters speak in exactly the same voice. They use the same idioms and linguistic quirks that would be interesting and add texture if they were used by only one character, but just look sloppy when everyone uses them. The stories are told in first person, and it's like the narrator's voice takes over everyone else's.Besides that, these books are fast-paced and enjoyable. I especially liked this one."
4,Customer Review,The seller shipped the book in great condition. It was sealed in protective plastic and arrived quickly.
3,United States Army in the Korean War--South to the Naktong North to the Yalu,"Pages 419 through 488 were not bound within the book, and pages 505 through 510 pages were inserted in their place; pages 505 and 510 were also bound in the book at their correct place. The material within the book is excellent; however, the missing pages requires me to read another source to determine what happened that was missing from the bound copy."
2,Lack of original ideas...,"I bought this book seeking teaching ideas for the birth to 3 age group. While some of the activities for older children (in this case, age 3) would be engaging, the majority of ideas/information is useless and outdated. There are other books on the market that do a better job of collecting/relaying teaching ideas for young children."
2,Good for teachers only,"I think this would be a good book for teachers or day care workers. A lot of the activities in this book I've been doing with my daughter already, or would only work with materials that a day care or pre-school would have on hand."
3,Good Ideas!,"I thought this was going to be a book that would have the ages of the activities listed. It didn't only says ""Infants"", ""older infants"" and ""toddler"" activities. I needed more specific aged activities si I know if their appropriate for the child. Overall its a good book."
4,Excellent Start,"I am a preschool teacher who has taught kindergarten and 4 yr olds. Having been asked to take a new job with 2 and 3 yr olds was a lot more difficult than I thought! With all the choking hazzards and lack of fine motor skills, it's hard to plan lessons. This book gives some excellent activity ideas. I loved it. My only negative thought is that the book doesn't really follow ""themes"", which almost all schools use these days. Still it's a great buy!"
3,Good for older toddlers and ideas...,"Have to say I expected more activites for the younger set than was actually in this book. I did find some of the activites to be worthwile, however, I would recomend this book for children 2-3 more than Birth to 3. Activites for Birth to 1 are very few and far between."
4,Useful Book,"I bought this book to help my 15-month-old have fun on days it was too rainy or cold to go outside. He gets so bored and fussy when he can't go outside. It is most helpful for my Nanny, who doesn't have a car to take him to an indoor play space. There are a lot of useful suggestions and I like the way the book is organized"
1,disapointing,"I was disappointed is this recording, compared to Kimya's others. (esp. ""Remember That I love You"") Her unique, honest, from the heart lyrics seem to be missing here. The quality of the recording stinks. Most of the songs are so whispery soft they can't be heard, then a few are screechy loud. Not easy to listen to. I'm a Kimya fan, but I consider this CD is a waste of money and time."
1,Tourmaline Ionic doesn't work for me!,"I bought this hairdryer because there was no mention of ""ionic"" power or ""tourmaline"" or ""ceramic"" in it. I don't know what that is and I don't know why you can't buy a hairdryer without it any more! All I know is it doesn't get as hot as I need it to dry and style my hair. I have to take twice as long to get my hair done and I can't get enough heat to give it a curl where I want it and not enough to straighten the parts I want straight! I get no volume or frizz control when I use that type of hairdryer either. I even called Conair to ask about it and they told me it doesn't change the temperature of the dryer....but I don't believe it. I was so excited to see a dryer with a retractable cord on it....but forget it. I will keep my old dryer with the messy cords and give this one away at Christmastime. :PPS- No problems with Amazon though!"
5,~All things work together for the good...,"Great heart wrenching story of the pain and trials Michael faced growing with the shame of molestation hanging over his head and weighing down his heart. Great story of redemption and where he found his peace,strength,his ability to forgive and Who changed his life from misery to joy. Don't miss this one."
5,So Touching,"I picked up this book in the bookstore today and read halfway through it while I stood there. I was so touched by Michael's story, for I could relate to so many of the emotions he felt as a child. I also appreciate the fact that he made positive suggestions about ways to help children who have faced the same sensitive issues that he has faced. The book is well written, and I higly recommend it to hurting people, as a means of better understanding, that they are not alone and to others who need to know how to commiserate with people about issues, that they have never faced."
3,Story of Angst & Redemption,"Michael Reagan writes the kind of autobiography one would expect from a radio talk show host -- part soul-bearing, part diatribe. This is not a particularly well written book, so don't wait around for the Pulitzer, but it's a quick read so you won't hate yourself for having spent the time reading it. It it is a heartfelt account of a man who has finally battled his demons and come to peace with his place in life. Along the way, Reagan uses his story as a jumping off point to talk about social issues (divorce, pornography, etc.). His story is interesting for fans of his father, a little insight into the family history and a sympathetic portrayal of two parents (Ron & Jane) who did their best to raise a troubled kid. Mike also shares a clear story of his commitment to Jesus Christ and the huge difference that has made in his life story."
5,Loved this book,A great read. I really enjoyed his life stories and his opinions of what can improve our world. This book helped me come to reality with my past and to realize my past can be used in a positive way to give glory to God.
4,Twice Adopted - A gripping true story illustrating the power of grace to overcome the evil of abuse,"Michael Reagan shares the story of his life without holding back. The pain of sexual abuse and its life effect is clearly stated. You learn first hand the hidden, and not so hidden, influence abuse has on a life and the life destruction it causes. Michael also shares how unconditional love helped him to overcome, but not forget, the stronghold the abuse had upon his life and how it impacted his family life. You also will learn how you can help change our society for the good and stop the cycles of abuse. Read it - your life will be changed."
2,Don't believe the hype!,"The book deserves some credit because it does list contemporary training techniques in a comprehensive fashion, but it does not bring them together in a practical manner. There are also certain errors: 1) That you should do plyometrics last in a training program. Yeah right, high intensity training when you're tired. That removes the benefits and sets an individual up for injury. 2) Not mentioning true periodization for strength training. 3) Presenting impractical programs, especially for high school athletes. 4) Giving credibility to a fad diet (i.e. The Zone). That's almost shameful. If I had time, I'd list some other complaints. It's sad, but I have to admit that this is the best book out there for speed training. Just read it critically!"
2,Overrated,"This book is mostly a kitchen sink approach to speed training methods and is a sure fire perscription for overtraining. And as previous reviews have pointed out, the book does not provide an overall logic that helps the athlete or coach properly integrate the training elements. The book does not properly explain how the components of its sytem interact with each other and how they should be balanced against each other when determining the needs of a given individual athlete. In addition, many of the techniques, most notably overspeed training, are highly dubious and most likely counter productive. For those interested in proven speed training methods, I highly recommend Training for Speed by Charlie Francis, which is light years ahead of SportSpeed. Also be on the lookout for Charlie's new training manual which should be released by the end of 2002 and will make every other book on speed training obsolete."
2,They have fun with it for a short period of time,"Yes it's fun.But...It's noisy and it did break down to soon. My husband fixed it twice, but after that it was really gone.Not really durable and therefore dissappointing for our son."
1,Piece of Junk,"We bought this toy for our son at Christmas this past year. He was 18 months old at the time and loved it. Within a month it started to be unreliable. It would work sometimes, other times it wouldn't even spin the cars. Now, 6 months later, the toy is completely broken. It won't even turn on. And my son hasn't played with it for months! Very frustrating!"
1,Discontinued for a reason!,"My son received this as a 1st birthday present. I felt that I had done great research as I didn't want his aunt to waste her money or have a toy that my son wasn't interested in. Well, as it turns out, I was wrong on both counts! It stopped working after 2 weeks! I changed the batteries and called the company. They informed me that it was discontinued and sent me another toy for free. My son still plays with it even the track is broken. He loves the music and dances to it. It is bulky, but I won't trash it yet since it keeps him entertained."
1,really expensive for a cheap nonworking toy,"the track stopped spinning ater 1 month! I have tried to fix it myself to no avail! huge Bummer, he LOVED it while it worked!"
2,Great Concept ...Poorly made,My son received this for his first Birthday. He was still a little young for it but loved watching his big sister (who is 4) play with it and finally learned how to make it spin on his own and did love it BUT it stopped spinning after less than 30 days. My husband took it apart and attempted to fix it but we could not determine the issue...a disappointment and not worth the money!
2,"Loud, then Broken","My daughter received this for her second birthday. She liked it well enough. She enjoyed putting all sorts of items on the track to see if they would go around. Plus, she enjoyed turning it on over and over. The volume was too high in my opinion. The racket of the tracks rotating competed with the loud music. There is no volume control, only on/off.After about 6 months of play, the belts for the track seem to have stretched and were constantly slipping so the tracks would no longer rotate. Ended up in the trash. Honestly, I wasn't too sorry to see it go..."
2,"Such an awsome idea for younger kids, wish it didn't break","I got this for my son on Christmas despite some of the bad reviews. I was just so anxious to get him into the ""boy"" stuff. It worked well for two days then the track stopped working. However the loud sounds are still going strong. He loved it so much and now he is very dissappointed that it's not working, and so am I for the 30 bucks it cost!"
2,Too bad - great toy that just won't last,"I bought this toy for my son's 2nd birthday. I had read some reviews that said it breaks easily, but some that sounded like it lasted well, so I decided to give it a shot. This was the toy he was the most excited about when he opened it. He played with it, and it was his favorite of the whole birthday. By the next morning, the motor was no longer working. I tried replacing the batteries, but no luck. So, I packaged it up, and sent it back for an exchange. He was so happy when the second one arrived, and he played with it a bunch. He loves this toy!! Well, by day 4, the motor no longer was working AGAIN! I got a refund. I could not keep breaking his little heart until I got one that worked. Don't waste your time or your money."
2,A great toy until your 1 1/2 year old gets a hold of it,"My son loved the race track. He laughed and danced as the cars went round the track. It was a Christmas present that we recently opened (in May) because I felt he was not old enough. Within one day the toy doesn't work. My son pressed on the track, apparently too hard, and now the track doesn't work. Though that was not what he was supposed to do, one would think that a toy made for an 18 month + would be able to withstand a little rough play."
2,Disappointed... Stopped Working,"My boys loved filling the track with the mini Wheels cars and watch them race. HOWEVER, it just stopped working after a couple of months. The batteries are fine, but the track would not spin. Nothing to do but toss it. Big disappointment."
2,Fun while it lasted,"My son received this for Christmas last year (he was two) and loved it, although it wasn't long before the track stopped spinning. We tried taking it apart to see if we could fix it- that worked for a day. No volume control which is a also definite downside. I did like the fact that the cars were easy to handle and there were ""garages"" for him to put the cars in and take them out again. Really disappointed the track wasn't better engineered."
2,Mrs. Long,I bought this product for my son for Christmas and 2 days after Christmas it quit working altogether. I am so frustrated. For 30 bucks this thing should work better
2,broken toy,"My son loved playing with his new toy for the first three minutes then IT BROKE! The spinners wouldn't turn anymore, not sure why. He was so disappointed."
1,The price is $399?,You can't be serious to charge $399 for this toy! Whoever you have updating pricing is not paying attention and poor Hasbro is probably missing out on revenue due to people not willing to take a chance on Amazon actually charging them this price instead of something more like $39.99.
5,Hardhat,Functional and stylish - must have - makes a great gift for any Cowboys fan in the construction industry.
4,Nice product,I got the item very quickly. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the support/adjustment peice inside the hard hat was not to my liking. No big deal. I just replaced with the one from my old hard hat. Looks great.
4,Wifeofcowboy,Very cool idea... a little small though. My husband is going to try to get another insert.
3,Early Carson,"This CD arrived promptly in perfect condition. I was a little disappointed that all the shows were in black and white, Johnny Carson's early days on TV. He was and is still the best."
5,John Carson,"For those who remember Johny Carson, this is a great DVD, bought another one to give to my other brother who loved watching his show just like I did."
3,Not good,The item I receice the case was all cracked. I think you guys need to wrap it up more!!!! It was really sad getting my product and i was all cracked up.
2,I allowed myself to be misled,"I had failed to read all of the available information on this set. I'd thought it was 23 hours of early Carson, which it was on 1 DVD and the first 2 segments on disk 2. On the Carson stuff, you could definitely see the evolution of most of the bits that became famous on 'The Tonight Show'. Way too many of the rest of the set were absolutely and abjectly boring and I LIKE a lot of the early shows from TV's infancy, seemed like these folks went out of their way to find the worst of it to show here. Oh well, read all of the info available here before deciding to buy, although, unlike one reviewer, I was well aware we weren't dealing with 'The Tonight Show' here. I was well aware Johnny Carson had a life and career before then and most of it was pretty good."
3,the young Carson,"These segments of Carson's earlier career may not have been what ""Johnny"" wanted to be seen and remembered as, but it is interesting this early stage of Carson comedy."
3,"Not Great, Not Bad","These four DVDs are a mix of old time shows, including the Johnny Carson Show. The quality isn't the greatest, but it isn't bad considering how old the original films are and the poor quality of television films were to begin with. For the price ($5-6), one can't really complain about the quality. It is an interesting DVD set to watch to gain some insight on what television was like back in the mid-50's."
2,Everything you've already read and heard,"Kudos to Dr. Taylor for her personal achievements, but that does not compensate for the mediocrity that is ""Brown Skin"". At times it reads like a bland encyclopedia of skin issues and other times like contradictory medical tripe. Reading this book only left me more frustrated at the dearth of good in-depth skin/hair care advice for people of color. Even more frustrating, I emailed her people asking for the ingredient list for her product line. They wouldn't give me a straight answer. Instead they just repeated verbatim the advertisement from the website.Bottomline: If you know absolutely nothing about hair/skin then this book will be great for you, otherwise pass."
2,rx for brown skin,not very much new info alot of basic hair and skin care guide would have been more useful if she just posted the produts she preferred for her customer use....
2,Boring Book !!!!,This book made me feel like I was studying and I did not like it one bit. I knew alot of the helpful tips in the book already. I did not finish it I feel foolish for buying it.
1,Worst book Ever....DON'T BUY IT.,"Brown Skin: Dr. Susan Taylor's Prescription for Flawless Skin, Hair, and NailsThis was a total waste of time and money...I returned it. It was way too generic with information that I already know. I was hoping for more in depth information."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"I do NOT recommend that you buy this book. Dr. Taylor is very good at promoting herself and appearing on television, but I do not believe that she is better than any other dermatologist at treating the skin of people of color. She is more style than substance, I suggest that you SAVE YOUR MONEY and check this book out of the library if you have the time to read it but don't spend any money on this."
5,A must have for people of color,"I am a black women who decided to get my look together before I turned 30. I dont have tremendous skin problems but I just want my skin to look youthful and vivacious. I found out how to get that type of skin by reading Dr. Taylor's book. It was so helpful that I could have cried. The section on how to remove/prevent the dark marks that are sometimes left behind after having a blemish was exceptional. In only a month, my skin has never looked or felt better. I dont feel the need to wear makeup anymore. She also gives very good product recommendations based upon your skin type. You can tell that her advise comes from research and experience. I highly recommend this buy."
2,Disappointing! Entirely too general to be helpful.,"The book would probably be informative to some people. Overall, I didn't learn a single thing. THE BOTTOM LINE: If you don't know anything about hair and skin care, if you are starting from scratch, then this book might be helpful. If you are like me, and you already read Essence or already have some knowledge of how and when to wash your hair and face, then the book will seem like a waste of money.Another drawback --most of the advice is incredibly general. A woman of color with skin or hair problems would be better advised to make an appointment with Dr. Taylor or another black dermatologist to get specific advice to help your specific problems. If you have health insurance, one appointment with a dermatologist should not cost to much more than the book."
3,Brown Skin,"After seeing Dr. Taylor on a talk show discussing her book, I ordered a copy. What a disappointment! She mentioned on the talk show that this book was targeted for people with ""brown skin"" from various ethnic backgrounds whose unique skin coloring, hair, nail issues are often overlooked in the ""mainstream"" media. She glossed over this topic big time and I found the information bland, the pictures basic, and a lot of the same information repeated throughout the book. Unfortunately she is not telling the ""intelligent and well informed"" reader anything new. Her marketing spin is that she is a Doctor who happens to be a woman of color."
