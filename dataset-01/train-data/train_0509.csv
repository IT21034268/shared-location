1,Very tired,"Mr Coonts has written some good thrillers but sadly this is not one of them.Set after the events of 9/11 this sees the return of Admiral Grafton trying to hunt down some nukes being smuggled into the States. The same old characters and maverick antics do not make for a great thriller. I also had concerns at the very cardboard and stereo-typed bad guys. Very much by the numbers and predictable stuff, a shame considering that Mr Coonts is capable of so much better.Perhaps the time has come for Grafton and co to be dumped and for the author to use his talents with a new cast of characters..."
2,Another poor Jake Grafton novel by Coonts,"There was a time when I enjoyed a Stephen Coonts novels. That time may have been before I read novels by good authors. I'm about one third of the way through Liberty, and I doubt that I will finish the book. Sure, the idea that Islamic extremist obtain nuclear warheads with the intent to detonate them in the U.S. is believable. As far as I'm concerned, the characters, the situations and the way the characters react to those situations is far from believable. There is nothing imaginitive about this novel and you can see well advance of the lame characters what is going to happen next."
3,a good read,"LIBERTY is a shamelessly entertaining right-wing potboiler. Admiral Jake Grafton (Coonts' longtime hero) and his team are on the trail of nuclear warheads that terrorists plan to detonate in America. There are numerous double crosses and shifts in point of view, all of which makes for a cant-put-it-down type situation.Coonts clearly takes the view that institutional infighting in Washington is hampering the war on terror, and indeed Grafton gets the presidential go-ahead to circumvent the CIA and FBI. The heads of the various agencies aren't held in very high esteem here, and Grafton usually manages to accomplish things despite them. Grafton is a man of action, not a windbag like a character in a Tom Clancy novel. The action moves along briskly, and I felt like I was right there during the climactic scene at the Statue of Liberty.Even though I don't agree with all the politics here, I enjoyed LIBERTY and will be reading more by this author. Recommended."
4,Jake Grafton and friends save the world yet again!,"This book was written by Stephen Coonts after 9/11. He weaves a plot in which Middle East terrorists and a couple of disenchanted Vietnamese refugees buy or steal some old Soviet nuclear bombs and try to blow them up in major US cities. Of course, Jake Grafton along with his wife Callie, old friends Toad Tarkington and Tommy Carmellini, new friend Anna Modin, and others intervene to save the day. Even though you know that the good guys are going to win again in the end, Coonts takes you on an exciting, suspenseful ride.Whither Jake Grafton? Is he really retiring? I'm awaiting Coonts' next offering with bated breath!"
3,I'd go for the regular dark chocolate without Espresso.,"I bought both Lazzaroni Dark and Lazzaroni Dark with Espresso. I can feel the grain of Espresso, which is kinda annoying. I'd go for the regular dark one."
1,"Best of books, lousy edition","I bought a copy of this wonderfull book to replace a modern hardcover version which was also junk (poorly put togeather, cheap paper). This edition is even worse, the cheapest of binding, very poor ""feel"": by feel I mean how a well put togeather book with a nice cover and quality paper just feels good in hand. ""International Editions"" sounded good so I bit. I am now going to buy a third copy of one of my all time favorite reads and will leave the ""International Edition"" in the free box.KDM"
5,Strait Foundation,"This album reflects the foundation of country music star, George Strait. For more that 20 years, The Ace In The Hole Band has been backing up George Strait. This band is one of the most respected back up bands in country music; producing wonderful country sounds of all types."
2,Editorial problem,There are two pieces of student artword on page 99 of the book. The people that are given credit are not the students art teacher in both pieces of art work. I am the art teacher at Pathfinder Elementary School and my name is Julie A. Smith. The two students are in my classroom. I did contact the editor and the author of the book. They have both apologized and will correct the error in the next printing.
5,Excellent analysis of Women and Surrealism,"Although the publication of ""Women and Surrealism"" by Whitney Chadwick in the 1980s brought about a larger appreciation of women involved in the movement, there is still a surprising shortage of material published about surrealist artists such as Leonora Carrington and Remedios Varo. ""Mirror Images: Women, Surrealism, and Self Representation"" offers a series of insightful essays on these and other artists' images and ideas of self. Most interestingly, many of the essays discuss the work of Surrealist ""descendents,"" including Cindy Sherman and Louise Bourgeois. Overall, very well constructed and written, with essays by the leading scholars in this still under-appreciated area."
1,"Get the ""Dirty"" version instead.","The one star isn't a reflection of the music, but rather this ""Clean"" version. It simply deletes the 2 songs on the regular version (DK's ""Too Drunk..."" & Josef K's ""Sorry For Laughing""). ""Too Drunk..."" is probably the funniest of all the tracks, so not only would you be missing out, but you'd be stuck with a disc that no one wants if you try to resell it. Make a copy without the tracks if you really need to censor the music."
1,Cute but poorly thought out,"+ It's cute.- As I recall from the packaging, it's not dishwasher safe. (Don't quote me on this one.)- The bristles were twisted out of shape in under a dozen uses. It still works, but it looks junky.- The brush surface area is tiny. It doubles my potato scrubbing time.- It's too small to fit in my palm. Instead, I must hold it in my fingers. It gets tiring.It got replaced with an OXO brush after a couple of months."
3,It's a documentary interview with short music interludes,"The disc itself is a collectable item, but the content is definitely geared towards the pure fan followers of Kate Bush herself - as opposed to her music. She reveals some interesting details about how the different songs were conceived, but other wise it's closer to a PBS-style Charlie Rich interview."
2,Not the best pet carrier out there,"This arrived very quickly, and was packed well, but the item itself is not good quality. There were no instructions included, either, and - though you don't have to be a genius to figure it out - it would have helped. My main issue is with the door. It is easy to pull it off, even when it's closed. Now, I bought this for a 6 pound, tiny cat and will rarely be using it. It sufficed for the one trip I took with it, so I won't be returning it. I wouldn't recommend it for a larger cat/dog and I'd recommend paying a little more and getting a better quality carrier, for those who are looking."
2,Bad Pilot Treatment,"I've read worse. Not by much, granted, but I have read worse. Two major flaws were the superficiality of the characters and overly self-aware use of ""clever"" language. One assumes there would be more depth to the follow-up novel, now that we all know who's who and what each character means to the other. The author should consider dropping the lesbian bit, as it reads like what it is, a man's PC attempt at portraying a lesbian. Or perhaps just the characterization of Bird as a controlled machine is the problem, since none of her relationships seem to involve, well, her."
3,from the back cover,"Hell Awaited ThemThe beaches are swathed in heavy moring mist as the soldiers of ""Operation Anvil"" swarm down nets into invasion barges. A sudden tornado of flames and flying German steel erupts, and in moments the foam at water's edge is awash with bodies and tinged with red.The German defenders have their orders: ""The FÃ¼hrer counts on you to fight to the last man."" But each man of the Allied force who emerges safely from the sea to storm the bloody high ground has his orders too: smash the Nazi war machine and either live in freedom or die in its name!"
3,Be Careful,"We liked these products for their robust colors and proper sizing.But believe us, they really aren't for use as undergarments -- too uncomfortable."
2,Too musky for me,"I purchased this perfume after trying it on my wrist at a dept. store. I think I had tried too many and confused my nose! Blush has a very strong musky scent (almost rivaling body odor.) There are some nice floral notes, but the musk overpowers them. I have ended up layering this scent with other perfumes to hide the musk notes."
1,Disappointing,"As this book was recommend to me by a speech pathologist, I had high expectations. The small amount of information included in the book was stretched with puzzels and fill-in-the-blank exercises so it could fill the short 78 pages and be sold in book form rather than in a pamphlet attached to the glove as would be more appropriate."
5,Stop thumb sucking now,"I purchased this book for my daughter when she was 7 years old and still sucking her thumb. We read the book, followed the goals and used ""thumb gloves"" (just cut the fingers out of soft winter gloves and sew around them to keep from fraying - this leaves only the thumb with a glove). We had several thumb gloves so we could wash them. The thumb gloves allowed my daughter to stop sucking her thumb for good. This book provides the perfect solution to stop thumb sucking in older children who want to stop sucking their thumbs. My daughter is now 9 and still wears her thumb glove to bed."
4,Great Adventure Wnderful Humor,A truly wonderful British man of war seafaring novel. Marryat is a wonderful story teller. Good characterizations a little mystery. One difference in the Marryat novels is the stories he tells about the pranks that some of the sailors and officers get up to onboard ship and ashore. And of course this is a usual part of shipboard life but the other officers such as O'Brien don't give us as much of this side of life at sea. Some of the pranks had me laughing nearly out of control
3,Usual Marryat - good!,"Marryat displays his colors in his usual fashion: ""normal"" people, real characters, and the tang of salt air in your nostrils as you read.The unacknowledged son of a post captain, young Percival strives to do his duty to achieve his father's/captain's respect. Adventures ensue.Easy to read. Less social critique than Mr. Midshipman Easy. Less gruesome reality than The Privateersman. Not his best, but it is still a good yarn!"
1,Still Truckin' interview,"Despite the Garcia cover pic, this is an interview with Mickey Hart. Gives an insight into how hyper-self-critical of the Dead MH could be. Of some interest to DeadHeads, but you're not going to be playing it over and over..."
3,Looking outside our own culture,"This is an interesting look into a the culture of Java and the position of women in that culture. Parts of the book are a bit disjointed but this is a translation and that may account for it. The author has about 30 books in all and I am planning to try another. I read this for a book group discussion and in general, we liked it and learned a good bit from it. Thought provoking story."
1,Did not get it,I got the heel cushions. I ordered them the same day as the Splint. I didn't receive splint yet. What is going on?
5,BRUCE & STANS GUIDE TO THE BIBLE,THIS BOOK WAS VERY ENLIGHTENING AND LIGHTHEARTED ALONG THE WAY. IT PUTS THINGS IN VERY COMMON LANGUAGE AND REALLY HELPS TO UNDERSTAND THE PARTS OF THE BIBLE AND SOME OF THE HISTORY OF CERTAIN PARTS IN EVERYDAY LANGUAGE AND SOMETIMES MAKES YOU CHUCKLE. THESE GUYS HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR WHILE GETTING THE IMPORTANT THINGS ACROSS. RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY. IT MAKES YOU WANT TO KEEP THE BIBLE NEARBY SO THAT YOU CAN RELATE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING TO THAT PART OF THE BIBLE. SO GLAD I FOUND IT.
3,Not bad,"Overall this is a good film. The potryal was wonderful.What angered me the most was how they made Cleopatra! OMG! Could it be any more Hollywood?!?!?!? She was GREEK first of all! She would have NEVER dressed like that, unless it was at a ritual, or banquet."
4,Imperator Caesar Ivlivs,"I liked this movie - and like all movies seem to do (sadly), this one is a little loose on timing, characters, and so on. But this does an admirable job of giving the uninitiated a ""conversational"" education about Caesar."
4,An Informational and Entertaining Flick,"A nice movie - if you're one of those people who loves to watch the History channel, then you'll enjoy this one. However, if you are looking for something to outline Shakespeare's play of the same title, then this isn't the one for you....it's more of a semi-accurate historical recreation of events, rather than the play. Good cinematography and production values - decent acting."
4,Julius Caesar,Quality rendition of what it may have been like in 34BC. Worth the addition to your Ancient Roman Empire library.
2,Julius Caesar: His Time Has Come,"This is not one of the best movies that I have seen. However, Considering the timeframe the movie takes place I can't completely say it is all bad. Sure it's a movie but it shows possibly how Julius Caesar become who he was. How his accention to power proved to be his own downfall."
1,Garbage,"While it has a high production value, the historical inaccuracies are painful to watch. However you might feel about Caesar, the facts show us a man capable of both great and horrible things. This movie tries to make him out to be the consummate good guy, the Dudley Do-Right of Rome. I watched it hoping to show it to my 6th grade class, but I would never subject them to such a laughable take on history. Watch it if you're a fan of the actors or for a good laugh, but don't expect any historical value from it."
5,Great death/thrash,"This is one of the most underrated metal acts from the early nineties. Its a shame that they didn't have a breakthrough. ""Lay it to rest"" includes a couple of great tunes that are melodic yet aggressive. Superb instrumentalists and very good singing. The tracks ""Domination"", ""Possessed"" and ""Utilized"" and ""Aspects..."" are especially worth mentioning."
5,Branched drains to the rescue!,"With this book you don't have to be an architect, engineer or plumber to do a perfect installation of a ""Branched Drain"" greywater system. It's no exaggeration to say this new design is the ""best greywater system since indoor plumbing."" It is a brilliant, deceptively simple design. This manual covers adaptations for just about every conceivable context and provides step by step construction details in a fun, straightforward manner that eliminates all chance of making mistakes. Responsible technology enthusiasts will appreciate the extraordinary good design and extensive experience behind this book."
4,AT&T E6014B - E6012B,"This is a good one. I got the set that had 4 phones, indicated by the last digit in the model E6012B mine was a E6014B. I'm a hard person to please I think. This is a very decent purchase.First it's a ""COLOR"" screen such as it is its still better than that crappy mono. Life is too dull without color.Solid signal through-out my Florida house, concrete and wallboard with metal studsPurchase price was reasonable at $149.00 (retail) for 4 phones and it performed better than the V-Tech 3-phone set I bought for nearly 300.00 4 years ago.I doubt you will be unhappy with this. No buzzing, dropped signals or anything weird so far"
3,caller id,the phone works well enough..I would have liked the unit to also have the caller id on it. When the phone rings often it is easier to check out the base of the phone unit to see who is calling then to find the phone real quick!Also i would like the volumne button to be a bit louder on the base unit.And it must be me..but it takes a couple of times to get the delete unit to work..you have to play the message to get it to delete it seems.Otherwise it is a great unit!
3,A few flaws,"Maybe I got a lemon, but I constantly have to reset the time/day settings on the answering machine. Every few days it drops the time and starts flashing ""help!"" In addition the digital clocks on the handsets are too slow and are therefore unreliable. Otherwise usable as a phone. Good signal, good sound, no interference."
2,rabbits must be getting hungrier,"i used this product for a few years. i applied it as per the directions, spraying a wide perimeter, but now the rabbits run over it to get to the unsprayed areas. if i see them eating in an unsprayed area i apply the product there. it doesn't last that long because i have to water my lawn almost daily and it gets washed away. right now i am replacing the bare spots with new sod and watching for any new areas where they are eating."
4,Keep the Deer Away,There is no such thing as a perfect deer repellant (that does not repel other animals of the domestic variety). Liquid Fence comes the closest in my experience. It still takes a couple applications a week. I use a 2-gal sprayer. The concentrate is the cheapest way to go.
5,Liquid Fence,Works great. Totally does what it says it does. Repels deer and rabbits. I wouldn't have much of a garden without it.
5,Deer Really Gone,Liquid Fence works better than any homemade products I have tried.It is easy to mix in a gallon sprayer. It really smells strong for several hours and then I can not smell it. The Deer do and stay away for several weeks. I like to spray every 3 weeks or so. The first time I sprayed real heavy and follow ups are just a light quick spray. I bought a gallon cheaper on Amazon and free shipping than 3 quarts at the hardware store @ $39 a quart plus tax.
2,I frickin' hate rabbits.,"Used to think rabbits were cute & cuddly. Turns out they have no souls and incessantly destroy your beautiful plants without any consideration. They all must die. But if you choose not to kill them, this is a friendlier method. Doesn't last long, especially if it rains or if its irrigated where applied. Gotta be applied at least once/week, at least where I live with these evil furry unscrupulous raisin-laying mother-effers. Anyhow, mix enough product that you will only use for that day, since it is made from rotten eggs, it will form clumps of mold as it sits in your pressure-sprayer. These chunks in turn, will clog up your feed line & sprayer wand, rendering your equipment useless.Rabbits are the work of the devil."
2,meh,Doesn't really work very well in the real world to prevent deer from eating your plants over the long run
5,EXTREMELY GOOD DEAL,"I MADE A GOOD INVESTMENT BECAUSE THE BOOK OFFERS METHODS OF WRITING IN ADDITION TO BASIC THINGS LIKE WHERE TO PUT EXAMPLES, PUNCTUATING COMPLICATED SENTENCES, AND HOW TO HANDLE BOTH TYPES OF ESSAY QUESTIONS. I HAVE BOUGHT ABOUT FOUR COURSES (SELF-STUDY) COURSES AND NONE HAS THE METHODS.BECAUSE THE BOOK IS ABOUT WRITING ESSAYS, IT INCLUDES THE DETAILS A WRITING CLASS MIGHT GO INTO BUT WITH A LOGICAL REACTION TO ESSAY QUESTIONS. THAT WAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WADE THRU HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF UNNECESSARY MATERIAL LIKE SOME BOOKS THAT TRY TO MAKE MONEY BY CHURNING OUT CRAP.FOR THE PRICE, IT'S WORTH IT.I GOT MY BOOK IN DAYS BECAUSE AMAZON SHIPS WITHIN THREE DAYS. I DON'T BELIEVE THE WRITER FROM HONG KONG.TONI"
4,REALLY HELPED ME,"This little book is packed with all sorts of info that helped me. I could look at the examples and see the connections fairly easily, so I think it's a really good buy."
5,Excellent Review for Essay Structure,"This is really the first text that I've seen that gives concrete details on writing patterns. That's the focus: patterns and structure. And it gives the reactions to types of questions and how they are scored.I can't understand how another reviewer-a student at that-would know how these essays here would be scored by ETS. Something is fishy about the negative review, respecially in criticizing a college professor who does and teaches it for a living-my professor.Thanks Mr. A."
2,poorly written,I bought the book to prep for the written portion of GRE. I think I got 4.5 out of the written portion but not because of the help of the book.I think it is horribly written. I wish I had not wasted the money on it
1,It's a waste money,"I ordered this book amidst holidays and it eventually arrived just one day before my test. The ideas are neither succint nor helpful. A waste of money, though not so much a waste of time cos it should take one less than 2 hours to flip thru the whole book."
1,too technical,"This book went way back to basic sentence structure and how to do punctuation. Assuming that one has a degree already (since this test is for grad school apps), you have written papers and know where to put commas in a sentence.This gets too bogged down in way too many technicalities. Its overwhelming and overanalyzes too much."
3,Padded Review?,"Suspicious pattern - Whenever a bad review occurs, a few days later there is a cluster of five-star reviews all on the same day."
1,One of the worst I've read,"If you want to see what confusing and lousy essays look like, buy this book. Otherwise, I highly recommend the readers to seek other GRE reference materials, such as books and related websites, for the real and successful ways the issue and argument essays are constructed. I don't consider my time and money spend reading this book a complete waste, since now I can confidently discern the difference between 'good' and 'bad' essays."
4,Tight and Good illustrations,I was amazed at the concise illustrations in writing reader response essays. The patterns are there in outline type forms for different types of essays like cause-effect and comparison etc. so I feel like I made a good buy for the buck.Cutie Pie
5,Excellent for Writing Methods,"This is an excellent review for writing methods. Actually, it reviews things like punctuation etc. but brings out the big guns with other thjings like writing methods and spotting argument problems in essay prompts.I learned a super lot and I am vey, very happy with this product. My friend told me so now I recommend it too.Juanita"
5,"Nice, Compact Review and Guide","Very, very good for answering the prompts and recognizing the issues. This has been the best WRITING GUIDE by far. It gives the whole gamut of how to see and react to the test questions. The other books are just without any strategies or concrete tips."
5,Straight to the Point,"I didn't have time to waste so I followed advice from a friend and got this. I could not be any happier.If you're busy, this is the top pick because it gets right to it with no extras."
1,Poorly organized and poorly structured,"I returned this book after reading the first 10-pages. I bought this book with the expectation of finding the type of quality you can have from Barron's or Kaplan's as applied to the writing assessment section of the test. To my chagrin I found a 'primary school' type of guide that made emphasys in elementary aspects of grammar. This guide provides a number of fake-essays which do not even closely relate to the real GRE essay questions. It provides NO guidance or advice on how to develop an strategy to answer essays in an structured manner under time-limited conditions.In summary, Do not waste your time and money on this guide. Buy Barrons GRE guide which contains a concise yet thorough section on how to write the Argument and Issue essays of the GRE. If you need to polish up your grammar I would suggest to go to your nearest public library and get a quality grammar book."
4,Super Good for Basic Overview and Pattern Development,"This was really good for the basic overview plus as a guide to patterns. I have gotten Barron's,Princeton, the free downloads, and Prep Course. There is NO magical formula I have seen in any of the books on stylistics but this definitely shows how to set things up and respond accordingly. Stylistics is only hoopla and developed individually. This one is very well worth a ten dollar bill and some change !"
4,Good Book-Easy Reading,"This is a good read, very helpful. I recommend it because there is no HYPE (tripe is intestines) and simply shows how to do it."
4,Very helpful,"I purchased this book for under $1, the book was in great shape and it is very helpful and easy to understand. I would definitely recommend this item to others."
4,Good study guide!,I am a current MCSE NT 4.0 going for my MCSE 2003 with 10 years experience.This book did well in covering most topics for the exam. I passed with a 905 after two weeks of studying. There were questions on the exam that I would not have known just from reading this book. Questions relating to bluetooth were not covered in this book. Overall it was a good study guide.
4,Good....but not Great,"Good is good enough. I passed the 70-270 exam on the first try after reading this book and taking practice exams from two major exam prep testing software packages. Still, the exam is wicked hard."
2,Suspect,This square breaks almost every rule in the pimp rule book and has the nerve to call himself a master pimp. any true mack that read this book knows this Johnny Benford was always a square whos constantly getting Georgia'd by broads dont waste your time IceBerg Slim & Goines are all you need to turn out.
1,Pretty Weak piece of NA propoganda ... a total joke.,"You don't realize until towards the end of this book how much of a joke it actually is. This kid tries to front like a Master Pimp but in fact he is a FairyTale square. Although he plays it like some sort of story of his life sans the realism ... making it an allegory teaching the ins and outs of the game, you start to realize in sheer horror towards the end of the book that the whole thing is a piece of Narcotics Anonymous propoganda masquerading as a booking on pimpin'.What a farcical piece of tripe.After reading Grandmaster Slim, K-Flex, or even A.S. Jackson, it's no wonder this dorkwit had to spend his own money to publish and distribute his book. Any real publisher would have told him that his game needs so much work that he needs to go back to the school of hard knocks and STAY THERE FOREVER."
4,the pimps rap,"This man is brilliant he weaves a story of street life and morals that is compelling.This is definately a must read for any young man living the street life,trying to see good in himself and life.A rare gem giving a glimspe of urban life with glitz & flare abound.Master Pimp tells a story we all can gain something from."
5,An indispensable guide - make this your Ireland B&B Bible,"This compilation is not overly inclusive nor is it too limited. A sensible price range is represented, as well as a good variety of different style lodgings (Farmhouse B&B, Guest Houses, Castles, etc.) These are the places you want to stay in while visiting Ireland. Descriptions of the rooms, furnishings, views, history and proprietors are succinct and accurate. Cross-reference with other guides and use Sawday's recommendations as a stamp of approval -- you won't go wrong."
4,Great reference for finding the top tier Irish Home-Stays,"This is must use resource for those who want to stay in a charming Irish home with a few more amenities. A place which is just a step above a regular Bed and Breakfast.If you want your own bathroom, a little bigger room, a little nicer bed, a little prettier setting and hosts who are serious about the hospitality they provide - - this is your reference. Each home has an entire page with a picture and a very good backgrounder on the accomodation which typically includes detailed information about all the facilities, pricing, local attractions and a nice note about the proprietors.It is similar to the ""Friars' Guide to New Zealand Accomodation for the Discerning Traveller."""
3,Dedicated Black Crowes fans will enjoy this,"This is a decent CD of an interview with the entire band. Chris and Rich (Robinson) do most of the talking, with some interjections from Johnny Colt and Steve Gorman. One MAJOR flaw in the CD is the fact that you cannot hear the interviewer's questions. It is almost as if he doesn't have a mic. This is pretty frustrating when you can hear this low murmer from the interviewer followed by a hearty laugh from Chris or an answer that doesn't reveal much about the question. The total playing time of the CD is around 38 minutes. No source or date of the interview is given, but the time frame is sometime after the Shake Your Moneymaker album was released. All in all, not a bad album for those who enjoy hearing what the guys in the band have to say for themselves and their music."
5,Field guide for the Trenches!,"You know how it goes...""I wish I had found a book like this years ago."" Well, it's true. It would have made my journey to the heart of new media much easier. If I read this book early on, my start-up costs would certainly have been less!Avgerakis divulges tons of useful knowledge, tips, and info that only an experienced media producer would know. His writing style is light-hearted and friendly. His information and techniques are very approachable to the person just beginning in this area. And with this book, even the professional has practical, insider know-how to help gain a competitive advantage. Highly recommended!"
1,Medical info for Spanish speakers,"These CD's are USELESS. I'm not sure who could benifit from buying this. There is no English spoken. You will have no idea if this is even Medical spanish unless you are already fluent in medical spanish. I speak a little spanish and was pissed that I wasted my time and money on these CD's. After going through the first CD I fast forewarded every CD just to see if maybe more was said later, but no. There is no explination in English of what is being said on the CD's.DON'T WASTE YOU'RE MONEY. If you really want it...you can buy mine."
5,Superb,"When I visited the museum at Wounded Knee, I asked the woman at the counterwhat she would suggest as the definitive book on the subject. She told meshe was Lakota and her favorite book so far on the accuracy of what happened therewas this book..""Moon of Popping Trees"". I could not put the book down...and wasamazed to find out that nothing has changed much in the dispatch of militarypersonnel to places unfamiliar with the ""American Way"". Had the military doneit's homework and left in place the officers that KNEW the Lakota, this tragedymay never have happened. This is a book of history, told true and told very well."
4,great deal,well put together and great for last minute costume shindigs that come up and you dont feel like going all out for
1,Save your money,It doesn't work. The pressure from normal garden hoses is insufficient to make the bladder expand. Without expansion no pressure builds up and the product is useless.
4,Great Live Performer,I happened to stop by a club in the City of San Juan Capistrano last night and was treated to a surprise performance by LA Jones. It was a great night of music. This guy can really play a guitar!
1,Only lasts for 2 weeks,I really liked this product...for about 2 weeks. But then I started noticing that when I woke up in the morning my foot would be extended out as if I hadnt even worn it to bed. my foot started hurting again. I tried fastening the velcro tighter before bed but I would just wake up in pain as the circulation was being cut off in my foot. The hinge is still in place so the best I can guess is that the strength of the plastic on the side broke down so it bends with the pressure of my foot and blankets. I don't recommend.
2,Needs a little more thought,"I bought the cub for a bout of Plantar Fasciitis, and it worked really well...for about 3 nights. The boot began to have too much give in it. It does not hold my foot in the propoer position any longer. It needs to have straps on the side, or a much stiffer piece of plastic on the bottom. The comfort of the boot is definately a plus though."
2,Just did not meet expectations,I was given this exact splint by my Podiatrist to heal my Plantar Fasciitis but have since (3 months of use)found it does not keep the foot flexed as it should. I agree it needs a side strap as the plasticis too easy to flex therefore you end up sleeping in the same position you would normally sleep in without it due to the weight of the covers and such. I would recommend one with side straps for the proper control needed to treat this problem.
2,Not as informative as I had hoped,"Being a parent of my first child, now 2 weeks old, I must admit that I didn't think the book was as informative as i had hoped. Don't get me wrong, it does explain the basics, but after being around my child for 2 weeks and then reading the book I learnt nothing new.Possibly this book is more valuable if you are still expecting your first child rather than having just brought your child home, because I guarantee after having the child home for a few days you get to know the basics naturally VERY quickly."
5,Great last-trimester read to get you in the baby mindset,"I found this book to be very helpful to read to get my head around the changes about to occur as I neared the end of my pregnancy. It is reassuring that the authors are doctors, but it is their knowledge as parents and doctors that really offers the best advice. I liked the straightforward, non-medical way of writing, and the short chapters so that you don't get information overload like other books do. I used it a lot as a reference after we brought baby home, too, and was glad that I had read through it once before I was sleep-deprived. A very useful ""user's manual"" for baby."
1,Needs more real help and fewer jokes,"Wow, this book had such great reviews, but I was really disappointed. There is some useful information in it, but the authors shy away from making actual recommendations, which becomes a little annoying. It seems like they are trying to please everyone.But what was most annoying is all the dumb, useless sarcasm and joking in the book. I get it, the authors think they are funny, but when you haven't slept in a week and are looking for help to get your baby to sleep I don't want to be reading things that are suppose to make me chuckle and just want help... which I did not get.My pediatrician's office hands out their own ~15 page book to all new patients and they actually helped me and I could read it quickly and get what I needed out of it. I wish I would have had it before the kid was born and I could have saved time and money wasted on this book.Oh, and I found their use of the term, ""burrito wrap"" instead of swaddle really annoying."
3,Meh,I didn't use this book very much. I liked the authors style and sense of humor but the information was very basic and not very practical. You can find better information in the hospital brochures and online. The newborn stage is also very short and you don't have time to read! I would recommend instead The New Dad's Survival Guide ( for mommas as well as for dads) and What to Expect from the First Year.
4,new dad,Looked through the book and have found some great tips. Not going to be a dad for another month but it looks like this book will be a good reference.
5,baby facts,"My last baby was born over 30 years ago so I needed a refresher for my new grandson. Needless to say, things have improved a lot! This book had many useful drawings and well arranged instructions. I especially like the burrito wrap details. It works!"
5,Brilliant book to prepare you for bring baby home!,Great book. It is informative and gives you a good base of information to feel prepared for bring baby home. We would highly recommend this as a core book to have in you bookshelf!
3,"OK, but nothing original","The book has a lot of good information, but it is very generic. I was hoping for more of a reference manual and this was definitely not that kind of book. Most of the information I knew already either through classes or common sense."
4,Very useful practical advice,"As first time parents, this book was invaluable. I read it during my wife's 3rd trimester and after the baby was born we frequently refer to the pages. For example, My newborn had trush in her mouth and we quickly referred to the book to learn that it was nothing serious. The only complaint is that the details are scant and on a few topics(breastfeedig) we really wish the authors had gone a little in detail"
3,"Good Book, but very common sense advice...",The book is well written and has good thoughts for parents who may not know one little thing about parenting. I read this book while pregnant and kept looking for the 'aha' moment but it never happened. A very general book written to maybe conquer some small parental fears. I think a lot of what's written is complete common sense or you probably have heard through friends/family.I spent $ on this book when I should have started to read more about Babies and their developing minds. Something more tangible!
4,What a Book!,quality and content as expected. quality and content as expected. quality and content as expected. quality and content as expected. quality and content as expected. quality and content as expected. quality and content as expected. quality and content as expected. quality and content as expected. AN investment in the future.
2,ok,This book could be better I have only used this a handful of times as a reference finding other books that I have with more detail in comparison.
4,Cliff notes for your newborn,"It is a good quick synopsis. A caring for your newborn cliff notes. They address all the major topics, deciphering cries, poop, bathing, diapering, sleeping, car safety, illnesses etc. If you are going to buy several books regarding your baby than you could do worse than to purchase this one. However, if you only want to purchase one book, getwhat to Expect the 1st yr. They have an entire section devoted to newborn care. It basically gives all of the information that you could find in here. Plus, you are able to use it as a resource for more than just the first few weeks."
5,Well worth the purchase!,"This book is WELL worth the purchase! It is very straight forward, is extremely well written, and is very well organized into only the chapters that pertain to newborns (which is what I wanted and expected). I just finished reading chapters regarding breastfeeding/formula feeding and choosing the right bottle/nipple for your baby and I enjoyed every moment of it. I also love that this book was written by women but also that it was written by doctors who are part of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The book is of course fact-based but also gives helpful ""real world"" recommendations and suggestions.I highly recommend this book to anyone expecting their first child!"
5,Quick Five Stars,"You MUST have this book if you are about to become a new mom/dad!! It is everything you need to know, and I am not exaggerating! I did not buy another book because I didn't need to. I also never seemed to be able to put this one down because it is so easy to read and humorous at times. I got a copy for every new mother I've known since then. It is so non-bias, non-judgmental and highly informative about everything - I love it!"
4,Great book for new parents,"Not as informative on specific things as Baby 411, but overall a very helpful book when you're faced with your first pregnancy and not sure what to expect. The layout is great, the sections on feeding, sleeping, jaundice, just everything is wonderful! I had to flip back through it several times as soon as we got her home and everything was easy to find. Great book, great tips, I enjoyed it and found it a great help when I didn't know what to do!"
5,All the useful basics,"Many baby books are either intended as a reference that you can search for specific info or are just so long that you can't possibly take it all in and are therefore really only useful as a reference. I wanted a book that I could read cover-to-cover that would give me the basic information I'll need on a regular basis, and the most common danger signs that I should be aware of. This book was perfect for that; a good read to prepare yourself if you're expecting or just home with your newborn. I now feel like I know the essentials of feeding, bathing, comforting and at home medical care, and when I should and should not be contacting a doctor for at least the most common medical problems I'm likely to face as a new parent. Also, not at all preachy about the behavioral aspects of child-rearing, which I've come to really appreciate compared to some of the other baby books out there."
4,Excellent Resource,Good book for new parents with functional and useful information which is very straight-forward.....highly recommend purchase prior to baby's arrival.
4,Pediatrician moms give practical advice,"Covers the basics, clearly states what to worry about and what not to worry about, letting reader know the surprising large range of ""normal"" infant behavior."
3,A Good Movie,"Set in the old South, the story of Queen is a sad, but poignant one. The prejudice against her and the confusion and fear she endures because of her mixed heritage sheds light on the suffering of the times. The acting was great. I think this was one of the first leads for Halle Berry and she does a marvelous job. The only problem I had was her makeup. It's like they were trying to make her look lighter than what she was and her skin color would come out chalkie sometimes. Also, there was no way to confuse her with being white (because of her coloring and features), even when she was young (played by Raven-Symone), yet there was references to her being almost white as a sheet or something like that. Queen couldn't find help from white or black. Being of mixed heritage myself, it's hard enough these days, but during slavery times it was dangerous. But in the end, Queen finds a place for herself in this world with a man who loves her. It was a riveting story!"
5,In this movie tells the truth about cruel slavery.,in queen you can really feel like your watching real slaves at that time.they told nothing but the truth and i appreciated that alot.the reason why i want to own this movie is because i want to let my children know how hard it was back then.
3,Good,"I saw the movie before reading the book and I must say that the book was more interesting. I think that can be said for most books turned movies because of the detail books allow. However, I don't think the change in character was necessary to the movie to save any time. After all, much the time the book takes to read is due to the detail given to physical features, setting the scene, and describing supporting characters. The visual of film slashes those burdens instantly. On another note, I understand that Queen is the focus of the movie but I feel that more could have been done to develop the characters of people like Lizzie. Her upbringing and personal feelings of insecurity had as much to do with her treatment of Queen as the social order of those days. Even with all this, the movie is touching. The acting was excellent for the most part."
2,Too $$$,"Buy the 25-pack on Amazon. Also, the price each for the (CAT5e) item is about 40% higher than Lowes' 5-pack ($17.00)"
4,I really tested the seasons through Vanessa-Mae's play,"I am leaving in an Asian country with two seasons, i.e. dry and rainy seasons, and have never been living in a four-season country. I was expecting to taste the four seasons' atmosphere when I purchased Vanessa-Mae's The Original Four Seasons album; and yes, listening to the music I felt as if I lived in a four-season country: Spring has come, the birds announce it in happy song, and the brooks flow at the breath of zephyrs. Summer, swarms of gnats and flies, thunder shakes the heavens and breaks down the wheat. Autumn, the game flies and follow its track being frightened by the hunter. Winter, shivering, frozen in the chilling snow and blasting wind. I pray may Vanessa-Mae be given long live, good health, so that she would be continously sharing with us enormous fun through her playing violin. Vanessa-Mae, I love your musical philosophy and performance......my best regards to you."
4,"(I forgot what I wrote before, would be the same)","I am living in an Asian country with two seasons, i.e. dry and rainy seasons, and have never been living in a four-season country.

1,completely worthless product,"I just tried EnurAid and found it did absolutely nothing to solve the problem. I wonder if it's just a placebo because it has absolutely no effect whatsoever. Please take this useless product off the market and above all, stop taking people's money for it."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I was looking for an explanation of financial instruments in the petroleum market - APO's, calendar swaps, etc. At best I was hoping for some quantitative background, at worst I was expecting a listing of instruments. This book provides neither.This book is a short history of petroleum spot and futures markets. Fine if you need it, but terrible if you don't."
4,John's Last Interview,"Recorded the morning before he was murdered, ""The Last Word"" is an intriguing listen. John talks extensively about the making of ""Double Fantasy"" as well as his time with the Beatles and subsequent solo career. Much of this material was lifted for use in the ""Imagine"" documentary and the Beatles ""Anthology""."
4,Absolutely Wonderful!,"As soon as I saw that Ms. Furey had written another book, I bought it. I didn't read the back, I just bought it. I have been avidly awaiting any new books written by the author of the Aurian Saga. This book was everything that I hoped it would be. The characters are extremely realistic, the plot is excellent and you get drawn into the story on the first page. I can see in my mind the plights of these people and how the author is drawing them all together in what will be a magnificant climax in a future novel. My ONLY complaint is that Ms. Furey is known for writting multiple novels to finish one story and I hate to wait. I give this novel 4 stars because I'm bitter about having to wait another year or so before I can read the sequal. Oh well, anticipation makes the story twice as good."
5,Very interesting book,"This starts off very well and it keeps your attention from the start and you find your self very much hoping that the charachters survive and are delivered some nasty suprises and shocking events that you find your self hoping didnot really happen or was all a big mistake. The wonderful list of charchters and the way that they all come together (even though not all of them are human) with the aid of telepathy, is a very nice idea. I cant wait for the next book!"
2,Poor characters,"I found the characters shallow and after several chapters gave up. I gave it to a friend, and he gave up even sooner than I did (I am a Kate Elliot, Cherryh etc. fan - characters first!)."
2,A tragic dissapointment,"The plot and basic storyline of this book is intiguing. Maggie Furey creates a magical world filled with mythical beasts with a surprising twist. Each species is divided by a magical curtain that protects both the weaker species from the more aggressive ones and the different environments that each species needs to survive in seperate. I will stop here to avoid spoiling the story, because if I hate one thing about book synopsis or movie previews is that they give away the whole story before I even get a chance to read or watch them.However, the reason why I give this book two stars is because the writing style kills any enjoyment that can be obtained by reading this book. I find it surprising that such a terrible writer can be published. I mainly blame the editor that could have done a better job at cleaning up the run-on sentences and overuse of discriptives."
3,Gift,Purchased as a gift. Recipient was reading other works in the series and wanted this one. . . . . . . . . .
2,Some Good Info,This CD has some good information but sound quality is bad. It must have been recorded more than 20 years ago. I expected more direction from the program than it provides.
1,Psycho-Cybernetics,Another psycho-babble book from another time. Another system to try - massively boring and there are better methods or ways to look into our lives and learn to live them. Guess it was popular in its day.
5,The ideas in your mind tend to manifest in your life.,"Excellent overview of how a good idea in one's mind can grow into something real in the physical world. In this one book, Dr. Maltz says that as well as almost anybody (except the Bible) in my view."
3,Received in good condition,Bought this book for Book Club discussion. Would not have bought it otherwise. Still reading it and discussing at Book Club meetings.
2,psyco-cybernetics,not nearly as in depth as the book. much preferred the book. wouldn't recommend it to someone just being introduced to the concept.
5,Helped My Life for over 25 Years,"This book was recommended reading for my high school wrestling team. The coach wanted us to be able to see ""in the mind's eye"" the moves we needed to do.I'm 39 years old now, and being able to visualize in detail has helped me in athletics, dating, test taking, public speaking, parenting, and business. Your mind literally doesn't know the difference between an imagined experience and a ""real"" one, and you can ""see"" yourself succeeding in all kinds of scenarios.This talent lays the pathway for success in any endeavor. The book is not the easiest read, and it takes a few chapters to get into ""the meat"" of the book, but it is worth the effort!This book truly is one of the top ten of my life, and I have read thousands. To go beyond visualization, try ""I Create Reality - Beyond Visualization""[...]"
5,Sometimes you and your brain need a rest,"Most people are so on the go they don't even stop and think what they are doing. I bought this book 2 times, and kept going back to it, for things that happen over the course of ones life.It helped me in business, not to judge others, and if you feel uncomfortable with something, follow your thoughts not someones elses,you will learn from this book, this is not a Dr. Phil, Wayne Dyer type of book, written in the 60's the writer was way ahead of his time, your past has nothing to do with the present."
2,"A collection of stories, some of them factually inaccurate and self serving","This is not really a book but a collection of stories, which I missed before ordering... This could be alright, but they are told by people who have a vested interest in the revisionist history of Apple. Unfortunately they never really come together to tell a story, and what they do tell is obviously one side of the story and misses much of the historical importance of what was going on at Apple and other companies at the time. The book also contains some inaccurate information talking about things being invented at Apple that really were developed at other companies earlier or at the same time. The best part of the book is the great art work, pictures, and design artifacts shown throughout the book. I'm sure this will appeal to some people but it really missed the mark for me, I was hoping for a complete story of what was going on inside of a Apple."
4,"Great read, but maybe only for the enthusiast","This is a great book for anyone who loves the Macintosh or that great phase in the early 80's where microcomputing was all the rage. The book is mostly text, but the few photos help to illustrate the story. It's done in journal style, with each entry lasting from one page to about five pages. This makes it easy to put down, remember your place, and resume from the next entry.The only negative thing is that it's technical - very technical. There are times where even myself as a self-confessed computer nerd just found all the information way above my head. That said, this is only a small portion of the book, and those who are die-hard Mac fans will probably understand everything that is said.It was exciting to read about how the Mac team gew, how Steve Jobs showed through in his personality, and what little things kept the Mac team going to get out a great product in 1984."
5,Great Stories... a must for any computer fan!,"I am a Mac user, and I loved Apple products since I was a child but also like PC machines and I use it for games or work stuff.I was very interested in this book because I though I will find the little stories that show you the steps that original computers engineers had to make to transform those big monsters computers to the now common user friendly computer that all of us are used to work with...And the book didn't dissapoint me, almost all the stories are funny or has something that make it worth the reading.Pros:+ A lot of mac stories+ Some stories are just great for mac lovers.+ A lot of description about Steve Jobs and key apple engineers.Cons:- Very mac centric- Very short, I read all the book in 2 days!- Some stories deserve to be extended!"
3,Entertaining book... but why?,"The book is a fun read for any Macintosh fan, but all of these stories are available on folklore.org. I thought it was a dubious purchase when I bought this seven years ago, and now I'm even more sure of that. Good read, but just go to the website for all the same stories."
2,low-res,"There are low-res illustrations in the Kindle edition but it would be OK if the book itself wasn't rather ""low-resolution"" about technical matters, and almost completely ""null-res"" about business matters/politics at Apple during the Mac development time. It does provide some glimpses upon Jobs personality though, but these are ""too few, too late""."
3,Cool book,"It's a cool but, but the thing for me is, it's written in bite-sized bits, so reading it that way is a lot more comfortable. Reading two or three tales at a time is a little better. It's fun, regardless, and provides an extensive insider's look at how the legendary Mac was created."
3,It's ok.,"It's a good book for collection, but I can't say it's a great book as other reviewers say. It's better to see the book before purchase it."
2,OVERVIEW OF PROGRAM NOT AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IT WORKS.,"This book is intended only for the elected members of the Order of the Arrow (OA), a Boy Scout supported program for the promotion of camping and service to others. As a handbook it provides precious little information to members about what is expected of them and what they can expect from the OA. For example, it does not tell you how long it takes or what is involved in reaching the various levels of membership. It also does not share any of the ""privileged"" information for OA members. My suggestion is that unless you're a ownership freak, save your money and borrow a copy from a Boy Scout troop library."
2,Fighting for Comprehension,"Paul Richards writes this book from a controversial -- and certainly not typical -- perspective. While refreshing in this innovation, the argument is poorly structured, and Richards' writing nearly impossible to follow. I found reading this work unbelievably frustrating, and the convoluted presentation of both fact and theory inappropriate to a work of social science. Where were the editors?!?"
3,The most basic mouse ever...,I actually bought this mouse to replace a lost mouse ball for my more expensive logitech mouse. I did plug this mouse into my computer and since I was used to using a scroll wheel it was a pain to view web pages and excel spreadsheets. So if you want a mouse maybe for your kids computer or a backup or replacement this is the one.
5,Important reading,"Czech's treatise on the steady-state revolution should give pause to anyone who is concerned about the future our younger generations will inherit. Other alternative economic paradigms have been proposed, but few are as relevant to long-term sustainability. After reading Shoveling Fuel, one cannot help but stop chanting the perpetual growth mantra at least temporarily."
3,Rampant overspending begins with buying this book,"I was drawn to this book after it was suggested as an alternative here at Amazon to a so-called ""perpetual growth"" tome (a book, by the way, that actually points to no such thing), but I've decided against buying Czech's book for fear of becoming an overspent American. Sorry, but I'm not contributing to the royalty check of Czech."
2,Dishes for left overs,Am disappointed in this product from Corning ware. The containers are the right size for leftovers for 2 but I gave it 2 stars because the lids are impossible to remove without breaking a nail.
5,LOVE these bowls and lids!!!,"Durable, dishwasher safe, lids are very sturdy and i love the vent feature. Great for storing chili, soups, and take to work next day."
4,Great for soup,I bought this just for heating frozen french onion soup. It fits my onion soup perfectly when I bake it. I have not used the lids yet so I will update when I have a chance to use it. I bought this on sale at Macys store for $19.99.
3,Disappointing by half,"I bought this from another store and ended up returning it. The smaller bowls had lids that were so difficult to get on that it would've been a mess in the making trying to snap them closed if they had anything in them. Fortunately I tested the lids before trying to use them. The mugs, however, looked perfect and the lids fit securely without being a hassle. I wish I could've kept those and just returned the bowls!"
5,Really sturdy and don't spill,"My husband and I pack a lunch for work every day, and after the BPA revelation we have been trying to stay away from microwaving any food in plastic. We didn't buy this exact set (we bought 2 mugs and one of the flat, round dishes as separate purchases at our local Walmart) but we love them and use them all the time. We've probably had them 4 years and use them every week and they still don't leak. We've bought similar dishes from Pyrex and Rubbermaid and they aren't as good - at some point the lids warp and start leaking. I think the fact that they have the second lip on the lid is the key. I just wish CorningWare offered this type of dish in more sizes and shapes. I could use a couple slightly deeper and larger versions."
3,A more complicated read.,"The author goes into greater detail discussing the history of Celtic Christianity than some of his peers. With historical documentation being limited, he uses some supposition, but uses it well.I'd make it the second book that I read on the subject, after, possibly, ""Celtic Christianity"" by Joyce."
5,NOT JUST A STRAWBERRY HULLER!!!! :-),"Ok, I have to confess that although this does a great job of plucking out those leafy, strawberry stems, I actually bought this for another reason. Prepare yourselves...I bought it to remove the chalaza from eggs after I crack them to cook, which for some reason, just grosses me out even tho, I love eggs. This is also handy for removing black spots or bruised places from soft fruits, potatoes, etc. Multi-purpose item. Works for me!!!"
3,Magnavox 19MD357B HDTV Strange Aspect Ratio,"This TV has an excellent picture in both SD and HD modes, with cable, antenna, and DVD. It is an outstanding value for the price. I would have rated it 5 stars, but I deducted 2 for the screen size. The screen is 16"" x 10"". (I got one extra inch free.) Why Magnavox would do this is a mystery. I contacted them, and actually reached a support person in a reasonable time, but their only answer was a replacement, so obviously they did not understand the problem. Instead of a 16:9 ratio, it is 16:10 aspect ratio. A standard def picture is 4:4 ratio instead of 4:3. The TV automatically adjusts to fill the screen. This is not defeatable. In HD, 16:9 (or really 16:10) is the only selectable format. So everyone in HD always looks tall and skinny. I may or may not keep this set after I research to see if I can find anything close in value in the proper 16:9 aspect ratio. I'm getting used to it. Jay Leno looks like an athlete."
2,"Very disappointing, only lasted 1 year","I bought this TV/DVD combo exactly 1 year ago to use in my bedroom. It was a fairly easy set-up and the picture quality was fine. However, this TV has a very annoying feature: EVERY time you change the channel, a pop-up menu shows up, and there is NO way to get rid of this. (I checked the Magnavox website to make sure.)About a week or so ago, the TV started acting up. Right after turning it on, it would make a loud blaring noise, sort of like the severe weather alert on TV stations - but louder - and then shut off. Usually the picture quality went bad, too. Then the TV would turn itself back on.Over the past week, it has gone through this shut off-come on cycle more and more, sometimes taking about 5 cycles before it would stay on.After googling this issue online, I see it's a common problem with Magnavox TVs, so I've now ordered a Toshiba. Once that arrives, I'm just tossing the Magnavox in the trash. What a disappointment."
1,Magnavox Lemon,"I too had problems with this TV. It would never play any of my DVD's even new ones. After about 3 months, the picture just suddenly died. I can still get sound but no picture. I would never buy another Magnavox."
1,Piercing sound then shuts off then repeats - POS,"This is the least played tv in our home. It is only 2 years old. We play it just before we go to sleep for the news. As soon as you turn on this POS it shrieks a horrible high pitched sound then turns off. Takes about 15-25 tries to get it to work.Never again Magnavox. Forget about it! There should be a law that such inferior products that have such a mass scale problem, should be forced to give us a replacement or credit to get another TVNever again Magnavox. You screw me once shame on you. You screw me twice shame on me. There will never be a second chance for this awful manufacturer. I will never get a Magnavox tv again for the rest of my life !I will use it as a 9mm target practice in the desert.Magnavox used to be the very best. Oh well, stuff happens."
1,Poor Product,"Magnavox 19"" LCD HDTV w/ DVD PlayerBought Nov '07, started malfunctioning June '09. When turned on after being off for sometime (tipically overnight), the sound would cut off or a piercing whistle would start after a few seconds. None of the controls would work and the unit had to be unplugged, wait a few seconds, replugged, turned on again. This dance would be done 10-15 times before it would settle down and work normally, although with a few crackles and pops for the first few minutes of uninterrupted operation. A search on the Internet indicates that this is a generic problem with many Magnavox models, not just this one. Too bad, as it has a very good image and vibrant colors, good audio (when it works!). Now the unit is out of production, but the problem is carrying over to newer models. Magnavox is not fixing it and I will stay away from their products as well as Norelco and Philips."
1,Piece of Garbage,"I remember when I had televisions growing up that were from the 70's - not the most visually pleasing units, but they worked. Well, this POS Magnavox TV is broken a little over a year from the initial purchase. I can't eject my DVD, and I can't turn the thing on. I doubt my warrant will cover it, but I've learned a valuable lesson. Don't buy Magnavox!"
3,I like it.. not a lot but for 200 I think that it's worth it.,Magnavox 19MD357B 19-Inch LCD HDTV with Built In DVD PlayerI obtained this tv as a promo through direct tv. It was free with a two year contract. I ended up cancelling the contract and the tv ended up costing me [...] bucks. I have found it to be a capable little tv dvd combo. Do not expect very much from it but it is good for the kitchen or an extra room I suppose. The divx player has come in handy. The remote and interface are bulky and lack serious settings. Not to many options. I have it hooked up as my computer monitor and have a hi def tv as an alternate display off the comp. THe tv produces much darker colors and lacks a vibrant look. It is always warm but sometimes this works to its advantage ( well....sometimes) ahh its ok. nothing more.
1,Disposable,"Very, very disappointed. Our first problem was the design of the DVD player. It allowed multiple DVDs to be inserted...which our toddler did unbeknownst to us. Then the dvd player stopped working altogether. So maybe that's not the fault of the TV. The thing that has me thoroughly annoyed is the same issue that others have reported. Our TV is barely a year old and it now screeches annoyingly loud 'beeps' for lack of a better term. You can not adjust or mute it or even just live with it. It's LOUD! The screen cuts in and out during this process. We now have to replace the whole TV."
1,"Wrought with problems, will not last for more than 1.5 Years","Similar to other reviews by users, the DVD will work only intermittently, the TV will randomly turn on and off and the sound has a high pitch fuzz for 10-15 minutes after we turn it on. Really a piece of junk, I bought another LCD at the Black Friday sale this morning. Will not buy another Magnavox product."
2,Not worth it,"This TV worked great until about 2-3 months ago. Then it started just randomly turning off after a few seconds of being on. Then it started emitting a high-pitched shriek after a few seconds of being on. This would alternate between the sound just cutting off. I'd had this tv for about 1.5 years when it started acting up. It was a nice tv when it worked, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. But seriously, a tv should last longer than 1.5 years, especially for this price. I'm waiting until the after Thanksgiving sales to buy another one, so until then I have to just deal with turning my tv on and off for about 10 minutes until the sound works, the shrieking noise goes away, and it stays on on its own. I came on here to see if this was just a weird problem of my own, but I've read several reviews of this happening to other people, even sooner than it happened to me. I would definitely not recommend this to anybody."
4,Small but good,"I thought this would be larger in size....it's only about 3.5"" diameter. The two size magnifications are good. I think it's pricey but it works for me. I'd recommend."
1,True Stories ? I'm afraid not...,"I looked very much forward to this unauthorized biography on one of the worlds most renewing bands ever; I have followed the 'Heads carreer from the early 80s and have seen them live many times (both as a band and during solo appearances). I am very disappointed by this book. It basically tells only one side of the story and leaves too many of the *real* questions unanswered. In case of Talking Heads, there's at least four sides to every story, but the way the ""Byrne vs. Weymouth"" issue is described here is very subjective and unaccurate. A band that made so many great songs must have had fun in their carreer as well -the book doesn't say anything about this and only tries to get the dirt out. Don't waste your money on this one. Put on some (early) Talking Heads music in stead, go to the Talking Heads web site and read everything you can find there to form your own opinion."
2,"wow, david bowman LOVES david byrne.","don't get me wrong, i love david byrne too. but david bowman may have been better off just f***ing him and getting it over with.this book is pretty well written, if poorly edited, but is so laughably skewed to make david byrne appear to be an infallable and ethereal genius and to make the other members of the band look like absolute monsters. the author obviously hates tina weymouth and can't include a single quote from her without interpreting it to mean that she's untalented, stupid, bitter, spiteful, and jealous. he can't include a single quote from david byrne without explaining that if he comes off as a little rough, it's just because he's misunderstood (and a genius, and handsome, and creative).i enjoyed reading this book but didn't take any of it seriously. david byrne is clearly the creative force behind the talking heads, but bowman is basically a talking heads denier-- he doesn't even believe anyone else was in the band besides byrne."
1,Backstage Pass To Nowhere,"I was really looking forward to this book, despite the fact that this guy wrote that totally unreadable Bunny Moderne book, which should be pulped. There are some nice little bits in here, but not much that you havent read before in about five places. And the really assaultive bit is that the writer seems more enthused and impressed with himself than with the band. Not up to the task for the mighty heads, and a completely engorssing and definitive book on them is still waiting to be written."
4,History of the Talking Heads,"This book gives an informative if not entirely balanced account of one the greatest bands ever. While I agree with some faults noted in the other reviews, I bought this at a deep discount so it was worth the price. Any Talking Heads enthusiast should at least pick up a cheap used copy."
2,Talking Heads Deserve a Better History,"This book is poorly written, insufficiently researched and terribly edited. There is enough good information to warrant a second star, but Mr. Bowman's attempts to place the Heads' music into a broader cultural context are laughable at best. I agree with the reviewers who found that there is far too much clutter about non-TH art, like Twyla Tharp. This book is only worth reading if you're a total TH fan (like me), but definitely isn't worth buying."
2,Warning Sign,"The Heads were probably the most important band to emerge from New Wave, and they richly deserve a serious ""life and works"" bio. This ain't it. Bowman's book is wretchedly edited and sloppy with facts (not a huge surprise, given the imprint). But what's astonishing, given how big a fan the author professes to be, is how poorly he understands their work and how ineptly he reads the songs. I'll give it two stars only because some of the dish is new and intriguing."
3,Much too David/Tina centric,"TMBTP is not poorly written, but it's not terribly well-written either. I wish Bowman could have been more objective! I didn't expect such an incredible bias towards David Byrne. I'm a huge fan of Byrne, but I like the rest of the band just a much, and I DON'T feel that I got the whole story.Still, it's the only Heads biography still in print, and though it reads like a soap opera/Behind the Music episode, it IS interesting, if hard to swallow."
2,The great Talking Heads biography hasn't been written yet,"Talking Heads was my one of favorite bands of the 80s so I was looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately I don't know what to trust in terms of what is accurate or otherwise. How much trouble would it have been to fact check if James Brown actually sang ""More Bounce to the Ounce"" as Bowman writes? (He didn't. The great funk band Zapp recorded the tune.)I also would have preferred a little more balance in Bowman's reporting. His bashing of Tina Weymouth puts the integrity of his story into question."
3,Like a long Vanity Fair article,"The book was terribly engrossing and a quick read, though I question some of the information. For instance, how could David have had a tooth he chipped when he was four or five years old repaired when he was in his 20s? The damaged ""baby"" tooth would have fallen out and been replaced by an undamaged tooth in the meantime. Others have commented on the author's apparent lack of knowledge the music world of that time. (Calling Patti Smith's second album the worst CBGB-spawned album out at the time is ridiculous unless all the other albums were pure genius: while ""Radio Ethiopia"" is no ""Horses,"" it is intermittently brilliant.)The book reads like it was written by a younger Dominick Dunne, with lots and lots of name dropping. Still, nothing else I know of provides so much information about the band. I listened to Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club and David Byrne albums while reading. It left me missing them. I recommend it."
2,Doesn't Come to Life,"I found this book too much about the author, with too much name-dropping,and not enough well-researched story of early radio and television. It's more of a biography and less about the general history of these shows. Itwas interesting to learn how briefly the flowering of radio dramas really was."
1,"This, like all the pedometers I tried, was inaccurate","This pedometer seemed to have more features and was more practically designed than the 4 others I tried. However, they ALL had one thing in common - they were to inaccurate to be of any use. Worse, the inaccuracies were compounded with each increment of distance traveled!I gave up, bit the bullit, and got a Garmin 305 and so should you :)"
2,Too many crashes,"This game has serious potentional, but it crashes too much. I have the latest video card and no other game I have ever played before has this many problems. It has outstanding graphics, but even on minimal settings, it still crashes before a battle or during one. I would be careful before buying this one. Find someone who owns one first and try it on your computer and see if it works first. I am both a simutaltion and strategic game fan, this one has them both, but I am putting this one on the self until the designers update it and make a few patches. So buyers beware. see if you can rent or borrow first."
2,Problems with the game,This game crashes to much to be of fun. I hope the developers issue a fix soon.
2,"Right idea, but...","PACIFIC STORM is a great idea. A RTS game combined with an arcade-like battle sequence, along the same lines as the TOTAL WAR titles. However, unless you have a relatively new system with lots of graphics power and memory, it's going to crash a lot. And sometimes the battles aren't very realistic (I once fought four aircraft carriers, none of which had any aircraft on them). I think follow on efforts by this company are going to be great, but I would stay clear of this one. It's often fun when it works, but it doesn't work that often."
2,poor quality,lets look at the track record all the way up to patch 1.6. one patch made all the guns shoot backwards. Now if you update to version 1.6 all of your text turns to german. There is a work around fix for this but it's just another sign of really poor quality control to actually release patches like this to the public. after all of these patches the game still crashes usually when leaving a battle and going back to strategic.the biggest problem is there are no other games out like this to play right now. if there was then this game would be in the recycle bin. I do play this game though and get some enjoyment out of it(between crashes).
2,Saul vs Michael,I have listened to several Nero Wolfe books now and enjoyed them immensely as read by Saul Rubinek but I purchased the unabridged version of Second Confession and it is read by Michael Pritchard who while he enunciates very clearly lacks emotion. He ruined Archie Goodwin for me and the funny lines that are usually Archie's were wasted. Just my humble opinion.
2,Not up to my -- or Wolfe's -- usual standards,"This mystery has all the hallmarks of a hasty, poorly reasoned book. Red herrings are sprinkled throughout the book -- why were the Emersons so upset? why were mother and son searching Rony's apartment? why did they change their mind and welcome Rony to their home? Finally, the big resolution scene never satisfactorily explained how Wolfe figured out ""who dun it?""Light on the usual atmosphere and definitely short on the key to a good mystery -- Stout has done much better."
4,Entertaining,"I don't understand the reviewers who complain about loose ends. Do you normally expect the second book in a trilogy to wrap everything up? I'm guessing that those reviewers didn't realize that Zeck appears in three books (And Be a Villain, The Second Confession, and In the Best of Families, in that order). At any rate, any ends left loose in this book are tied up in the third.But even if you know and care nothing about Zeck, you should still be able to enjoy this books; he does not dominate it. Wolfe and Archie are both in top form, and the ploy Wolfe uses to expose the murder is both enjoyable and clever."
5,a great step-by-step practical solution,"I have just started using this book and it is such a relief. It is immensely practical and effective.This is a newer edition; for more rave reviews from people who have been through the whole program, check out the older edition:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/0446670537/(The link will be slow because it has to rebuild ""your"" view, but just give it time).If you really want to get better, if you're ready to do whatever it takes (because it does take hard work!), then this book can really help you take those steps. It's one of the few that are genuinely about ""self-help"" - how to gain internal strength and heal yourself. Good luck!"
2,"You can't judge a book by the cover, or the title.","Misleading title and misleading ideals on culture.I don't know if one can ever really know everything about one culture. The writer wears many hats for this book; and sometimes it makes the book nothing other than an interesting look at history and music. Unfortunately, there are many historical and cultural aspects neglected (probably because that would make this the longest book in the world) and it leaves something to be desired.I wouldn't call this book negligent if you are one who likes reading books on this topic. My guess is the writer is counting on this. Debates over who originated what, where, and for whom seems to be the secondary concern. Talking about the process of innovation seems to be the primary interest of the author. Collaborative forces at work to achieve separate goals."
1,This book is a joke!,"I can't believe I actually paid for this book. According to this clown Jerry Garcia is GOD and Eddie Van Halen is a joke. I'm not making that up. He says Jerry Garcia is GOD. He knocks almost every popular guitar player since 1973. For example, I don't care if you like AC/DC or not, Angus Young's best work was not ""Ride On"" off Dirty Deeds. Personally I like the song but it is in no way his best effort. Remember that little album Back in Black? He manages to list at least five hundred guitar players that NOBODY has ever heard of. I could go on and on. This book is as bad as it gets. I wish Pete Townsend would beat this guy over the head with a Les Paul Deluxe!"
1,Read up on Speed Reding,"Read this wikipedia article on speed reading:[..]I also was at a loss when referred to ""the workbook"". I downloaded the online audiobook from the library. It does seem to spend a lot of time telling you of all the benefits rather than starting you learning.When I teach people something, I first give them an easy task with some level of challenge to overcome. When the concept is grasped, and can be immediately reused successfully, the learner will want to do more. Why can't such ""self-help"" books provide this?!"
4,Jwin I188WHT iPod dock,This item fits the bill perfectly. I was looking for an iPod speaker for my 14 year old daughter to use in her room that would also charge her iPoad as well. I did not want to spend too much money as she has a tendency to break things. The I188 dock works great and does everything i needed it to do. The device arrived safe on a timely basis.I could not be more satisfied with either the service provided or the product purchased.
1,Hiss Noise,"Returning this product, had a horrible and very audible hissing noise coming from the speakers. Couldn't pinpoint the cause the hiss came and went, even with the iPod just on pause.If it helps anyone the label say it was manufacture June 2007.Also I have a friend that has these speakers too and it works fine for them."
2,Poor Quality Docking Station,"The quality of this product is poor. I wanted something inexpensive for my 8-year-old, but even my 8-year-old son deserved a better sound quality docking station."
4,Compatibility Check,"Hello, I would like to know if the I188WHT is compatibility with the ""Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player"", thanks you"
1,Authors don't understand the Yugioh Card Game...,"The book is a good reference for 'viewing' all cards available. If you want to simply view all cards and not go any further, this book is for you. This product seriously lacks the passion of the game. i.e Heart of the Cards.If you're looking for a book to give a enlightened view into the current card playing landscape and how each card may affect the landscape or a particular deck class (beatdown, card control, exodia, ect) this book will make you un-happy.The Authors of the book seriously show their ignorance of the game as a strategey guide. Prima thought they could push out another title and serously under-estimates the Yugioh card environment.I play Yugioh with my son weekly. We laughed at this book. It gathers dust on my shelf. I would strongly suggest the 'Pojo' set of Yugioh book guides."
1,delivered with shattered top,"The potpourri pot arrived when expected, but the top of the pot which was ceramic, was broken and shattered. It can't be used without the top, so is useless. Did not want to spend the money to return it, as the item didn't cost much. I was very disappointed."
3,Aroma Potpourri pot,I bought this because it thought it was a good price. I found exactly the same one i Walmart for the same price.
1,Junk,Didn't work well at all .. barely hot enough to get get it smoking even with the top off. I returned it.
4,Good Item,"This is a good item, house smells real nice. It dosent't get as hot as the older ones made do. But is still a great item."
1,Might have been great in one piece,I ordered three in order to get free shipping. Two were shattered and the third was cracked. Had to send all three back.
3,"Okay, but not that noticeable","I bought this potpourri pot hoping that I could make my living room smell amazing. Unfortunately the aroma stuck in one corner within a 1 1/2 foot diameter. I can use a candle for that. Also, when using water make sure all of it has evaporated before you turn it off. This will take quite a long time as the pot does not get that hot. Unfortunately I did not check the first time I used it and the stagnant water cause a very unpleasant odor that could be smelt in the entire room. All in all it is an ""Okay"" product. Just didn't live up to my expectations."
3,produit dÃ©fectueux/transport,"bonjourj`ai commandÃ© 2 pot-pourri, donc 1 Ã©tait dÃ©fectueux (ne chauffait pas du tout)..je suis allÃ©e sur votre site..pour la garantie, mais cecui n`est pas avantageux pour moi.. je dois assumer les frais de retour, ensuite assumer encore les frais d`envoi de votre part, pour un item d`une valeur de $9.99... a commence Ã  faire beaucoup de transport.. en plus des 2 articles Ã  $9.99 ch, vous m`avez chargÃ© $20.00 de transport.. quand j`ai demandÃ© un courrier(non urgent)... si je retourne cet item Ã  $9.99 en plus du transport de $20.00 et vous en retournez un autre et je dois encore payer $20.00 cet article me reviens Ã  $30.00 oÃ¹ est mon DEAL !!!..merci"
1,Did not give off strong enough scent,This did not even give off a strong enough scent to smell up a small bathroom with a closed door. Waste of money.
5,Great for house with birds.,"I have a Quaker Parrot and so I can't use Glade Plugins, regular candles, incense or room deodorizer because of the deadly fumes they give off that could harm or kill my bird.(I lost one bird to the fumes from the self cleaning cycle on the oven)So I am very careful. This is NOT a nonstick coating so its safe around my bird. I use a little vanilla extract, cinnamon sticks from the $1 store and orange peels in some water and turn it on. My room smells like Christmas and my little girl is safe. I add water everyday and change out the items every few days. My Mom liked mine so much that she bought two for herself and is going to get some for her friends."
5,Little pot with lots of fragrance power,"I now have two of these little potpourri pots. The first was purchased at a local store over 3 years ago and is still going strong but I wanted a second one and no one seemed to carry it any longer. I looked everywhere before going online and luckily finding it! I love my home to smell ""inviting"" so I have both pots plugged in ( one upstairs and one downstairs )to go on at different times with timers...filled with liquid potpourri! I also like the fact that they're very simple and attractive...I'm not one for flowers or objects printed on things! People who come into my home always comment on how great it smells! Great little pot!"
2,Perfect except not hot enough!,"What a shame! This little potpourri pot was exactly what I was looking for to replace an old one (that I should never have gotten rid of!). The size is perfect, small enough for just about any surface in any room, and the lid prevents any splatters onto furniture. Was not nuts about the stainless steel finish, too kitcheny, would prefer a pretty design, but that's not a big deal. The problem with this little pot was that it did not get hot enough to diffuse the oil scent into even a small space! So, it is useless. I returned it. Haven't decided whether to try another of the same (maybe this one was defective?) or just continue looking for a better product. sigh. Amazon was great about the return, as always. Gave the pot two stars anyway because of its potential."
4,A father-daughter diary,"This tender love story chronicles a father's feelings towards his little daughter. It's a tale of the pain and the pleasures of watching her grow up during her first seven years, of savoring each milestone in her young life, and then of being falsely accused of abusing her. The story, written in verse, is autobiographical. Fathers will enjoy sharing the book with their little girls, but they will want to ""keep to themselves"" the portions that deal with the anguish of a broken marriage and of being wrongfully charged."
5,Very pleased,"Purchased this set and had it hooked up to Dish Network on Dec. 10th. The picture is extremely good and, believe me, I checked out LCD TV's on-line and in-stores for over 2 months to get best bang for the buck. No glitches or problems so far. I did buy mine through Sears on-line due to no interest until 2010 and got free delivery, plus the price was only $899. Had a 14 yr old analog Magnavox 27"" and it gave us years of trouble free viewing so decided to stay with what I felt was a quality product. Do not hesitate to check out this TV!"
5,Just got this for $648 at Target!!,"This baby is now on sale at Target for $648! Plus if you sign up for a Target RedCard it's an extra 10% off for a total of 583!! So far, it looks great. I cannot wait to see the HD channels once I get the box hooked up."
2,OK quality - until it breaks,"Worked fine for about 9mo, then everything went berserk. Initially, the TV wouldn't turn on at first. Then, when on, it wouldn't recognize inputs from the cable box, dvd, or over-the-air broadcast. Then, the speakers would either (1) not work or (2) emit an ear-piercing shriek. These various problems happened about 1 in 2 times we would turn on the TV, though now the TV won't turn on at all. Luckily we bought the extended warranty. Do yourself a favor and save up for a better TV."
2,great for a few months,"i bought this tv from wal-mart for $750 with an extended warranty...it worked fine for about 3 months, then just last night the speakers started crackling....this morning i turned it on and there was no sound....the speakers just stopped working altogether....took it back to wal-mart and, of course, there are no more in stock...i just had to settle for a refund...now i guess im going to save up and try to upgrade...it was a great tv while it lasted....i guess you do get what you pay for....im bummed."
2,Disappointing for green tea,"This decaf green, like every other brand I've tried so far, is not green in color and is missing that light, fresh, ""green"" flavor of a good caffeinated Japanese-style tea. I'd say it is actually a bit smoky, sort of like a Chinese-style green tea, which is not what I'm looking for. I like smoky green teas, like Hojicha, but I don't like that flavor in plain green tea. I've drunk green tea my whole life and tried many kinds from restaurants, groceries and Asian markets, and this one just doesn't do it for me. It was surprising given the glowing reviews at Amazon that influenced my decision to buy it. So far Stash's decaf has been the best, but I'll keep searching for better."
3,Yuck Twice!,"I do not like the taste of this tea. It IS a better tasting green tea than many I have tried, but it is still not enjoyable to me. I bought a bunch of it to, based on the positive reviews, for the health benefits. I guess I am just not a green tea person. I am going try adding some spices or flavorings. I have tried and like very much the Constant Comment Green Tea from Bigelow but it, of course, has flavorings."
4,Great movie with a twist,"I may be naive, but I never saw the ending coming. Great movie, really great."
4,Thinking outside the academic feudalist dogmas...,A great departure from conventional academic 'black box' thinking that most likely will prove to be correct as more evidence mounts over the years. An invitation to expand thinking about human origins and life on Earth and not be confined by the taboos determined by the self-appointed 'elite' of university parasites that rule scientific establishments. To be read and re-read by anyone interested in alternative explanations to unresolved questions on the dawn of humankind.
4,Great to hear Gwen again,I always have liked Gwen Verdon and wish she was still around to entertain us. She actually was a better dancer than singer. Still she had a very unique voice that one could easily listen to. The quality of this CD is good and it is fun to listen to her sing some old standard songs.
2,Wasted my $13,"Liked her singing, no stylization. 34 minutes - taken from an LP. All (all) the songs I knew had stanzas, choruses, verses left out or repeated - typical of a pop album with good material. A real drag. A few unknown (to me) Styne/Robin songs. Robin was a wonderful lyricist, yet who's ever heard of him - did you know he wrote (with Styne) the songs for Gentlemen Prefer Blondes? Like his words much better than Sammy Cahn's - sinatra's favorite. That's sinatra. Wish I hadn't bought it. A few cute songs I hadn't heard before plus ""I've Got the World on a String"" and ""Daddy"" which I wish they'd left out. A very disappointing album. And like her better in her OBC albums."
5,A Different World,"In a better world this is the music I would hear when I'm shopping, or in the elevator, or maybe just relaxing on my couch on a Sunday afternoon..Now don't equate this with muzak-I just mean that this is both soothing and/or demanding music..You can listen to it while cleaning the house,just let it pass by you without interpretation or you can listen to it and if you put in a little work, it will take you places that you have never been before..This is the Jade Warrior of the Island records era, when owner Chris Blackwell,on Steve Winwood's urging offered them a contract in 1974 in answer to Virgin records success with Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. It was their 3rd LP for Island and it stood out from the other two previous Island albums because instead of one theme throughout the album it was broken up into two themes-one for each side-(remember vinyl).It's based on Zen Buddhism, very oriental in flavor and musical consruct..This is uplifting and entertaining music"
3,What to put in the center?,"A great addition to your Mikasa IC collection, but what do you put in the center of the dish, especially when you are refrigerating the eggs? We have been putting one of the Mikasa IC fruit bowls in the center and then covering with plastic wrap."
3,"""New"" plate arrived with brown stains","I opened the box for this deviled egg tray to find it splashed with brown stains that had to be scrubbed off with a scrubbee and Bar Keeper's Friend. Packed in new packaging and had manufacturer sticker on it but very strange how dirty it was. Very nice otherwise, once all cleaned up."
3,Green ums,"The product appears to be helping, but the dogs are still killing the grass with their urine. I'm not noticing as many areas of kill as their was before."
2,A decent reference for a graduate level,"Provides all the classic elasticity solutions in a single, concise volume. It's not the most readable textbook you'll find on the subject, but it's a decent companion for a graduate level solid mechanics course."
2,It is not a textbook,Like all Timoshenko's books it is not a textbook. It is a collection of solved problems. This book does not provide the general vision of elasticity -one of the most beautiful physical theories.
4,Insightful Read,A book which skilfully interweaves historical facts with the anecdotes and day-to-day life of a woman struggling to find her place in the Middle East.Was left with a sense of awe from her accomplishments and the beginnings of an inkling as to the political and religious turmoil and troubles of this region based on the history retold by Janet Wallach.
2,Gertrude Bell as Victorian Victim,"The most interesting life and times of Gertrude Bell are lost in this steamy, bodice ripper masquerading as biography. For entertainment, not a bad choice. For anyone interested in Ms. Bell or the history of Iraq during the Mandate Period, look elsewhere."
5,Why Didn't I Read This Sooner?,Janet Wallach knows how to write a biography and - at least as important - how to pick a subject.Gertrude Bell may be the most fascinating historical figure you never heard of; she helped craft the political organization of the Middle East that has riveted our nation's attention for the last several years.Wallach did a masterful job of creating a portrait of Bell's personality as she told the story of Bell's contributions to history. It's a riveting read that lends understanding of the problems we see in today's headlines.
4,The Desert Queen,Very comprehensive and detailed account of an extroardinary woman whose influence still shapes the Middle East today.
3,It is a shame such a shame such a fascinating woman could no,"This is a story of such a fascinating woman, but why could not another, less-dry writer have written her story? I find myself believing it will get better and I will be able to ""not put it down"" later on. However, all I do is put it down for months at a time. Such a story needs to be told and re-told and certainly not be lost to oblivion, but with this version, I am afraid it is a true possibility."
5,"Great read, amazing woman.","What an outstanding woman, she helped shape the middle east as we know it today. A dry read as it's so factual, but well worth reading."
5,Great read,"Gerturdue Bell: what a remarkable woman. A friend recommended this book and I found it so fascinating that I bought it for yet another friend. Strong women who make a difference are so interesting, and Janet Wallach does an excellent job relating the events and influences of this incredible woman with her biography (and photographs.)"
1,This book needed an editor,"I began to read this book with anticipation. I was a put off by the sort of breathless tone more worthy of a bad romance novel.About twenty pages in, I was surprised by a reference to the Ottoman Empire expanding since the 13th century from Constantinople. The Ottoman Empire expanded around Constantinople from the 13th to the 15th centuries, until they finally took the city in 1453, and promptly renamed it Istanbul.I soldiered on, until I was informed that British were fighting Germans in the Boer war in the late 1890s. The Boers, descended from Dutch colonists, would have been surprised to hear themselves described as German.These two mistakes, obvious to anyone with a decent knowledge of history, ruined my willingness to accept anything else in the book. I put down the book, never knowing if Miss Bell was able to overcome her lost early love.Gertrude Bell's life seems to be worthy of a good biography. This isn't it."
4,Interesting,"Overall I found the book a good introduction to the events that led to the creation of the Middle East as we know it today. The first part of the book is interesting from a strictly biographical angle on Gertrude Bell. Though I found the profuse gushing by the author about ""almighty England"" and on Gertrude Bell and her family rather annoying.The second part deals with the political intrigues which eventually created the Modern-day Middle Eastern States. From a historical perspective it really helped me to better understand the very complicated politics of that area."
4,exceptional woman,"I enjoyed learning about the fascinating life and accomplishments of Gertrude Bell and the delicate and complex Arab culture and political history. I sadly realize that the knowledge and lessons that the history provided for us so abundantly are not being applied by our current government. Should we make presidential candidates take mandatory history tests in order to qualify for their candidacy? I am not much of a history reader, but this book certainly inspired me to learn more. Also it is a shame that a person as influential as Gertrude Bell has not been well known to us as much as she deserves. The writing of this book was complex but coherent, very easy to follow and enjoyable."
3,gertrude bell - queen of denial,"I don't have a problem with the way the book was written. I believe it was Gertrude Bell's shallow spin on the world that makes it seem a dull book to some. While she had independence and money, she was mainly bent on self-promotion, schmoozing, and pleasing daddy. She makes no mention of the million and a half Armenian citizens of Turkey slaughtered under her nose at the time. The book is worth reading for a look at the obtuse charecter of a privileged, disturbed individual with connections."
3,A fearless warrior,"The book offers a valuable insight into the British involvement in Mesopotamia, today's Iraq, through the life of a remarkable woman who served as a senior colonial officer, and their nation-building strategy which resonates eerily with today's ideology dominating the US and UK occupation of Iraq. Gertrude Bell, a product of Victorian England, is accurately, though at times romantically, presented as a fearless individual who ironically discovers her true self and value in a region which relegated women to second-class citizens."
4,Fascinating bio of an unconventional woman & interesting info about Iraq,"Bell was an incredible, fearless woman who made herself an expert on the Middle East and then ended up working for the British government. She was involved in the creation of Iraq after WWI. Great glimpse into the early 1900's in terms of the history of the middle east, women's roles, and creation of a nation-state."
2,good concept but hard going,"This was my book group's pick and I could hardly wait to get it and read it; it sounded timely and fascinating. Unfortunately, it was like reading a textbook, interesting but WAY too dry. No one in our group finished it and even the brilliant woman who loves a book best if no one else understands it, didn't want to read it. I only stuck with it to page 50. Maybe it gets better as you get the author's rhythm, like Dickens. As much as I would like, I can't recommend it."
4,Surprisingly good read for what might be a dry subject.,"Ms Wallach keeps us reading as Gertrude Bell crosses the deserts and explores the Arab World before anyone, man or woman, knew very much about any of it - politics, cultural practices, foods, and morals. A great way to learn about the mid east and enjoy a good book at the same time!"
3,an amazing woman of the 20th century,I THINK THE BIOGRAPHY OF GERTRUDE BELL'S LIFE IS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND I AM ENJOYING READING ABOUT HER LIFE.IT IS VERY DETAILED AND VERY INFORMATIVE.
3,"interesting, but for many readers there are better places ..","Bell lived a compelling life: an uppercrust Victorian debutante too prickly to land a boy, one of the earliest woman graduates of oxford, and a self-starting desert archaeologist, linguist, diplomat, and political officer. If you enjoy other desert stories, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, The English Patient, etc., this will likely hit home, though I unfortunately must agree with other reviewers: it's tedious in the details, and Ms. Wallach is a bit hagiographic: rather than simply letting the story tell itself she seems defensive or eager to 'sell' the reader on how cool old Gertie really was. If you have a thirst for the desert or the mideast you're better off reading the classic ""From Beirut To Jerusalem"" or the other two mentioned above before you get around to this one. But if you've got an itch you just can't scratch for 'Victorian Women who Broke Cultural Molds to Influence the Formation of Iraq', get ready for a real belly-scratcher."
1,"Outstanding woman, mediocre biography.","As has been mentioned by others, I too wonder at the literary excesses of this book. ""She sensed his profound hunger...."". ""....her heart pounding, her cheeks burning hot, and as his blue eyes burned with desire, he took her in his arms"".Gertrude Bell, an outstanding woman, deserves a better, a more maturely written biography. Thankfully, they are out there."
4,"durable and fun and a bit ""plain jane"" if a display",This is the Tie Advanced Starfighter flown by Darth Vader in Episode IV(I would have made it his regualar duty to fly it in all episodes). I cool ship and virtually indistructable as in the polycarb-like plastic but some peices could get lost and childeren could get those guns in thier mouths if they fall out of the front(the only loose peices). Darth Vader does look cool in the octo-pain windshield. Without his helmet too.education is the design of the grid solar sails(yes that is what those flanks are..) Lucas can be a jerk but he is smart in designing and it was he who desinged this detail initially.
2,Have fun constantly putting the wings back on every 15 minutes.,"OK, the wings stay on like a loose tooth the first month, after a few 1000 wing attachment tries - these wings flop everywhere. I used to like this toy because it looks cool, but my 5 yo son is always fixing it, I get depressed just watching him waste his life fixing another garbage Hasbro Star Wars toy - and don't give me that line ""Well the wings are designed to break away...""Kids toys should be made to take a beating. Period. I don't like the pc belief that these toys are actually designed to break - I mean, is a kid going to be killed if they screw on the wings??? Most likely 99% of them would enjoy this toy more.I hate the fact that fans let Hasbro get away with murder by dishing out Star Wars toys that fall apart. Thank God Hasbro isn't in the parachute business...but Star Wars fans would probably still buy them while plummeting to their death...Lego at least gets Star Wars right."
5,This Works!,"After trying many products, this product opens ear canals and is the best at preventing ear infections in my 4 children!"
4,Orignal New Music from the heart of West Africa,"This refreshingly original suite of Manding music carries out some daring experimentation by providing a modern interpretation to traditional rythms and melodies. While the instrumentation still remains all-acoustic (highlighted by the kora, balafon, ngoni, and the rarely heard fiddle and flute), they are arranged with a rare panache and gusto. Listeners who enjoy this should also check out Toumani Diabate's ""New Ancient Strings""."
4,This is a very nice cover,This is a very nice cover and easy to handle. Has protected my saddle from the elements. I want another one!!
4,Nice looking rack,"This wire DVD/game rack is simple and cheap, holding 30+ DVD/games per rack. Some of the bars, vertical and horizontal, on mine were bent when I received it so I was unable to attach the two towers together or get the stand to fit on it. I just mounted them to the wall separately and it looks fine so no big deal, just something to consider when buying. The horizontal bars are pliable and easy put back into place..."
4,4 Stars---Drawbacks But Worth It For The Price,"I purchased the 28 count rack. It's is exactly as advertised. Light, pretty cheap, but does what it is supposed to do.It only came with 2 wall mounting brackets and 2 screws even though there are 4 holes in the mounting frame. I mounted both in the top, the weight of the blu-rays holds the bottom of the unit to the wall fine for me.Grab a drill and it will take you about 5-10 minutes to mark the wall where the holes are, drill the holes, push in the mounting brackets, and screw the unit into the brackets via the frame and screws. Feels sturdy and looks pretty good. FYI I have 2 of them right next to each other as opposed to 1 long 65 count unit."
4,Kind flimsy but ok,I m happy with it but that's because I screwed it onto the wall. I wouldn't love it as much if i had it free standing. It's so flimsy.
3,Flimsy,"It does the trick but wobbles a lot. It comes in 3 pieces that just slide together (base, top half and bottom half). I think if you wall mounted it that would make it more stable."
4,solves the clutter problem!,"Clean, simple, easy to put together. Very pleased with this product. These are just extra words. here are some more."
3,Alright,"I like the product but unless it is hung on the wall, as soon as movies or games are put on it, it starts to lean and tip over."
5,Can't get much better!,"These towers are functional and very versatile. They are free standing or you can mount them to a wall; they come with screws and drywall anchors. I really don't know what else you'd want in a DVD tower: they fit a lot of DVDs, they're sturdy, they look good, and they hold more than DVDs! I've used them free standing and I recently mounted them to my drywall. I can confirm that they DO hold Blu-rays: PS3 games and BR movies, fairly well. I also have some bigger DVD/BR cases that hold multiple disks and, with the help of some wire cutters or dykes, you can easily modify these towers to accomodate them. There are handles on the top so that the towers can be moved around easily (if you're into that) and the base keeps them standing well on carpet. They're also welded well and they aren't too heavy.-D"
5,I love it!,"I actually bought three of these and plan to buy at least two more. My family has one for our kids videos, another for commedies and a third one for video games. We hung them on the wall and they look awesome! I couldn't be more thrilled. I will definitely be buying more of these in the near future."
2,worthless: unable to assemble,"At first I thought this product would be useful for storing dvds, games, etc. The product came in three pieces: the base and two actual tower parts. I was unable to assemble the product and upon closer inspection, saw that the bars on the two tower pieces were not completely straight, making connection between the parts nearly impossible. I would probably only be able to use this product if I bent the bars in the angle they were SUPPOSED to be made. I gave up with it and am going to return it. I am extremely disappointed at the product's lack of quality and especially since there were good reviews for it."
5,DVD tower,"Mounts easily, looks great hanging on the wall (keeps everything out of reach of the kids!)... fits DVDs and video games."
3,great for will mounting but could be sturdier,"have purchased 5 of these, all wall mounted. They hold games, blu ray and dvd, the only ones i own they will not hold id the star trek directors cut. There is one double slot in the middle of each that allows for the storage of one double jewel case like this. Where the racks fit together it could be a tighter fit but when wall mounted this isnt a problem."
5,Great DVD Tower,"Love this dvd rack! My husband is disabled and can't bend over. So instead of sitting it on the floor, I took the legs off and mounted it on the wall - perfect height to reach the movies. We liked it so much that I went back and bought a second one. Now, it will not protect your dvd's from dust, since they are completely exposed. But a feather duster or disposable dust cloth works fine. And if you have alot of ""boxed sets"", there are only a couple places they will fit in this unit. This rack has the most space for single disk cases. IT HOLDS ALOT!!"
4,Very tall storage tower,"This item is similar to two other storage towers that I own, but quite a bit taller. Be sure to measure your space! (I obviously didn't)It took a second person's help to stabilize the bottom part of the tower while manipulating the top part of the tower to fit together, but once they went together, the tower felt very sturdy. I like the fact that it can be wall mounted or attached to the wall for stability."
3,Look ok not too stable,"Delivery was prompt, bu the stand itself is not too sturdy. I put about 30 DVDs on it and it wobbling. I had to put a phone book on the base."
2,Lear's complex,"The fact surprised us because it came all of a sudden: Caetano got old. Worst: nobody here in Brazil ever thought it would be possible. It is against all evidence. He was a synonym for ""new"" in Brazilian music since his first song in the 60's. But it happened. His ""Livro"" (""Book"") is a strange mixture of lyrical efforts, ""cool jazz"" and standardized rhythms. His sincere defense of Bahian popular music of the 90's is a prove that his greatest problem is not having left inheritors of his gift and his achievement in Brazil. The sonority of ""Alexandre"", for instance is characteristic of AxÃ© Music: the musically poor but rhythmically apelative music of contemporary Bahia. Since his musical sons proved to be mere promises he has to invent new ones. He has to prove that his legacy is not going to perish, that he invented Axe Music and it is worth his powers. PURCHASE ""ESTRANGEIRO""."
1,Caetano's worst album ever,"To the eyes and ears outside Brasil, Caetano is a genius and a very cool cat. Here in Brasil he has a loyal following, but he is not considered a genius by everybody. I think that Caetano is a fine singer and a good composer, but he surely can make horrible music, like the music on this CD. It's simply horrible. Caetano is trying to sound hip and up-to-date, but his ideas and his music are old for Brasil and for the rest of the world. It's ironic to see how americans and the people of other countries misjudge Caetano, seeing him as an inovative artist. This CD is a complete mistake. You have to be brazilian to understand this mistake. Sorry, guys. If you want to hear the REAL brazilian music, begin with PAULINHO DA VIOLA. He is the real genius, samba's greatest poet. You'll hear a brazilian master, not an old fart who's trying to convince people that he is cool and young."
3,An Uninteresting Cover of Veloso by Veloso!,"This a Grammy record. Unfortunately, Veloso won his first Grammy for an album which is not representative of his master career. Hardly all songs reminds older ones: maybe like a re-making of his own compositions with new lyrics."
4,Still has it!,"I am not from Brazil, i am from NY but i love brazilian music and i am sort of an officinado to the people that know me. I love Caetano Veloso especially his older stuff. His musical career is as varied as a landscape, you can love him one second and not the next so do not judge the ""music of caetano"" by listening to one or two albums it is vast. If you dont have caetanos older albums and you just heard this but didn't like it, check out ""Qualquer Coisa"" or ""Joia""."
2,Leave a lot to desire!,"This is far from the best work of Caetano. It is just plain dull ! I have most of his music, I will continue to get it, but this was a real let down ! I agree with the Brazilian reviewer from Porto Alegre."
4,Exceptional,"I love this album, even though there are flaws towards the end of the collection.At first I was uncertain about my wisdom in purchasing this record, but repeated listening bares fruit.Veloso combines beautiful orchestration and melody with driving rhythms spiced with a strong dose of the avant-garde.I may not like a song or two, but the album as a whole is exceptional. It continues to fill me with awe and wonderment."
4,Another Grammy for Brazilian Music,"This CD got the ""World Music Grammy"" this year. Caetano is an icon (or an iconoclast) of Brazilian music and culture. This CD, like all the others of his career has a spirit. He brought the cool sounds of jazz to the rythm of the drums of Salvador (Bahia). The result is singular music with singular poetry. You can also try a really 5 stars album of Caetano, called ""Muito(Much)""."
5,"Help, I need somebody, Help!!!","I could have beaten this game without a guide to help me. However, I would have gotten my first social security check before hand. This guide defenitely a must have for anyone that wants to beat this game during this century."
3,Buckeye Wisdom from Earle Bruce,"Good book by former Ohio State football coach Earle Bruce. Earle shares some of his thoughts on coaching and Ohio State. Great section on Chris Spielman, former Ohio State linebacker. Not alot of Ohio State history in this book, but good insight on Earle. I would recommend."
4,"A Funny, Quirky Read",I agree with the other reviewers. This is a great detective story -- with plenty of noir and intriguing characters.
2,Love and Devotions Christian CD,"The description of the CD said praise and worship, but the songs on the CD are a little slow for my taste. With the words praise and worship I was expecting a more upbeat CD. This cd is ok, but I wouldn't recommed this unless you are looking for slower music."
4,jerky strips,"shipping was really good,and i got what i ordered on time. will buy from again,alittle pricy but my little dog likes them."
4,"Dang hard to find, it seems","CV has serious chops at the level of guys like Robben Ford, Eric Johnson, Allen Hinds, Larry Carlton, etc. He can play great lines over complex changes and make it look easy. I have Garage Sale, but only on cassette, and at the moment, have no way of converting it for my digital collection, and I really want to because the version of Holly House on Garage Sale rocks soooo much harder than the version on Rumor Mill, which I do have on CD. If anyone wants to swap my CD of Rumor Mill for a digital version of Garage Sale, let me know at ivor.blog @comcast.net ."
1,The book that ended up in the trash can.,"I am most surprise to read the reviews about the book. Because I as a beginer just couldn't understand the authors way of explanations of the various topics. I have done my level best to make sense out of their way of vividly illustrated pages but to no avail. After I followed their instruction the last time and ended up not finding the discribed keys and icons the book ended up in the trash can. As far as I am concerned the book is garbage. This book was the 56th insruction book I read during the last two years and it was amongst the worst. I am a very organised person. This is where my first trouble started with the book. The chapters are there but without index. I ended up making an index. The explanations are there, but the way it is written is most difficult to understand for a beginer. It was a good romance at the start but it ended up in disappointment and now it is garbage."
2,WOW this book is confusing,"This book is confusing and not for the beginer, the content keep jumping back and forth, it is hard to catch. have to return the book. :("
2,A let down&#65533;,"I have to agree with the last reader. I had placed my order last March and was eagerly waiting what I thought was going to be another excellent addition to the WOW! series...I was sorely disappointed. I really love the series but like the last reader said wait until Photoshop 6 WOW! comes out with, hopefully after enough negative feedback, some new material."
2,Not useful if you are already familiar with Photoshop,"I really like the Wow book series for Photoshop and Illustrator. However I am quite disappointed at this one. Some examples are not new at all. This one is not useful to those who have the verions 3 and 4 Wow books. If you are new to Photoshop, you may find this book useful.I recommend beginners to read ""Classroom in a book"" and ""Photoshop Artistry"" for the advance users. Then buy a used book for version probably at half price."
3,"Ok, but not what I was hoping for...","We were doing a kitchen remodel, and I hoped this would be a nice replacement for my wife for a couple of months. Did ok, but oven took forever to preheat and even then took almost 2 times as long to bake things. Burners boiled water and made hamburger helper real well, but had to have both on to be able to use the larger burner at maximum heat. If you don't mind waiting for something to bake and boil, it's ok, but I think there might be better alternatives out there."
3,Just okay,The description said there was some highlighting and notes . . . but in reality there are so many notes I can hardly read the pages.
3,A Mildly Entertaining Let-down,"The reason I gave this book 3 stars is because I would automatically slap at least 3 stars on anything C.S. Lewis wrote (but usually it would be 4 or 5). And when I got this book, I was hoping that it would contain some great insights from his other books--but simplified so that I could see how even children are able to understand some of the complexities of the Divine. But it's nothing of the sort. Most of the letters contained in the book are rather dull, and many talk about the same books and characters ad nauseum. Also, while reading it, there is a feeling of discontinuity. If you have read every single other work by C.S. Lewis, then I guess maybe you should read this book--but otherwise, there are many other books that would be more worth your time."
5,EXCELLENT ADVENTURE!,"Michael Palin on his whirlwind trip through eight African countries is a blast! (literally for Mr. Palin when he stood too close to a flintlock rifle and suffered a slight injury) These DVD's are entertaining, informative, historical, exciting, educational, and memorable. At one point you feel you are on a camel trek across the desert with him. He uses every imaginable transportation in these four episodes that could so easily have been expanded to 6 episodes. He practically lives off camel and goat during the entire trip. These include Roman ruins, oil fields, cities, armed guards in Algiers and it was an eye opener to discover that the U.S. isn't the only country with immigration problems.Illegal immigrants try to cross from the African continent to Gibraltar and many lives are lost in the attempt. Please watch the special features for additional footage and Mr. Palin's interview on disc 2."
5,SO useful!!!,"I'm addicted to netbooks and most of mine (Yeah, more than one. What can I say?) have chargers that are bricks with a long fixed cord that runs from the brick to the netbook and a long detachable cord that runs from the electric outlet to the brick. The total length is always much longer than I need and the excessive length and weight make the charger a pain to carry. Enter the 1 foot figure-8 plug. It makes the charger more compact and loses a few ounces besides! Highly recommended when weight is an issue and the fixed cord from brick to unit is long enough."
3,Not sure if this a UL listed cord...,I purchased the 1ft one. The fitment of the plug is fine. It looks to be a quality product on the outside... but it just came with a generic product barcode label with Made in China printed.There is no indication that this cord is UL listed...I dont feel safe hooking this up to one of my recording device and just leaving it unattended while I am away. So I have not used it yet.
2,Way over 1FT,"Not sure why this item is listed as being 1FT. By my measure, it's about 20"", and it's labeled as being a 8121-0889, which google tells me is a 0.5M (1.6') cable for some HP product.Cable quality seems fine, but it's a good 60% longer than advertised. At the very least, the description should be changed."
1,"Great product, 5.99 shipping?","The product itself is nice and very useful, but why charge $0.45 for the product and then $5.99 for the shipping. If you add two to your cart it's 11.98 for shipping... guess these tiny cables weigh too much to all fit into one shipping envelope. Wait no the seller is just deceiving and knows that a $0.45 price tag will attract more customers to look."
4,difference in fabric according to color,"I had ordered this same bra in black a few months ago and it is the perfect bra for ladies that need support and pushup, nothing will fall out or move. Ordered this same one in cream/nude just recently and theres def a difference in fabric and feel between those two colors. The cream bra is even a tad looser on the top, thing that does not happen with the black. Just in case, I get professionally measured before a bra purchase when a lot of time has passed so I did get the right size. Above all, the bra still fits very well but I suggest buy the black one."
1,terrible--drastically inferior versions,"This is a shockingly terrible EP. This 'alternate' version of ""Come Together"" (for video/ airplay purposes) is toothless and has lame lyric changes--it sabotages the fact that it's a great song. The roughly 15-minute 2nd track is wholly aimless & awful--an all-time low point--does Jason seriously think this is good stuff? The ""Broken Heart"" versions here are unbearably lame as well. This EP, like the ""Medication"" EP before it, finds Jason offering drastically inferior versions of songs of which the album versions are brilliant, which is quite a strange & admittedly interesting phenomenon, however as far actual listening value of this EP is concerned, forget it."
1,Several swings below par,"Spiritualized have scored a first: They have delivered a release that is not worth listening to. J. Spaceman's drunk/stoned visions have devolved from beautiful fever-dreams to the DTs. The opening track is *essential* to MTV-watchers and the second track is a must-have for David Lynch fans, but overall this CD is an embarrassment. Skip it and wait for the Albert Hall CD."
5,Incredible!,"This will be a very short review. First of all, Volume 1 is better than 2, but 2 is still excellent. Second of all, this is simply the greatest live album of all time and will be pretty near impossible to surpass."
2,Must have Velvet Underground,"If forced to choose, I would pick ""live w/ lou reed"" volumes 1 and 2 over their mighty, mighty box set. The perfect introduction to the Velvet Underground. Perfect renditions of Ocean, Sweet Jane, etc., etc. My personal pick for best live album recorded ever."
4,Late Velvet Underground live,"This disc is consistently good. It reflects the late Velvet Underground which is indisputably Lou Reed's band. I can't imagine why they ever tried to make a studio record after Lou Reed left, but apparently they did.Each of the four Velvet Underground studio albums is a very different experience. Although this live disc pulls material from all four albums, it is played through a post-Loaded prism which is usually more straightforward rock-oriented. They play rock as well as anyone, but I still think the dynamic between John Cale and Lou Reed was what gave their early work such a special quality.That said, a lot of these songs are played to the point where monotony becomes positively trance-inducing, and with a casual, absolute conviction that you won't find many places."
4,the cover is the best part,"No, no, that's totally unfair. I didn't really give this album a listen until recently and I was surprised that I hadn't given it more time before. If you've heard ""Live at Max's Kansas City"" and are expecting more of the same, then you're in for a surprise. Caught on a rare excursion outside of New York, The post-Cale VU puts on a surprisingly good set of shows on ""1969,"" and what stands out most of all is Lou Reed's sense of humor. The between-song banter is pretty entertaining (though not on a par with ""Live Take No Prisoners""). If you buy volume one you're sure to want volume two. A good document of a great band."
5,Where alternative bands come to pillage,"Along with the MC5, the Velvets were the most undeservedly overlooked band of their time. This album and its companion, Volume 2, are still every bit as fresh played today as when they first came out. Eight, nine, ten minute songs without a wasted note, great versions of ""Waiting For My Man"", ""Sweet Jane"", and a thrashing ""Heroin"" are all here plus more. Lou Reed and the late Sterling Morrison run a hefty guitar clinic, and the banter onstage is pretty rich. Great stuff. Five stars also for the second volume."
3,Pretty but not the best quality,"Currently in the midst of a kitchen remodel, I spent many hours searching for the perfect pendant lights.When I saw this model online, I fell in love! It has a dark coppery gleam and makes a unique statement. It is a metallic mesh in the form of a lampshade with a neutral cloth lining. Protective opaque glass is fitted at the bottom of the shade. Depending on the bulb used, this pendant will not give off an extreme amount of illumination.We bought 3 pendants. The problem is that 2 out of the 3 pendants came with some of the metallic finish scraped off the surface. A tin/aluminum color was underneath the finish. The flaw is noticeable from a few feet away. For the price, I felt this was unacceptable. Although a unique design, it is not of the highest quality and does not look like more than an expensive light."
4,Overall great value but difficult-to-read numbers,"I like the 5 kg. capacity and the auto shut-off feature and am thinking of buying another for strictly non-food applications. However, the digital display is very dim and the numbers are very hard to read if the item being weighed is bigger than the platform, for example if they are in a big bowl. If I were to redesign this scale, I'd place the digital readout on one side, in a slanted position."
4,"small, light, cute and very useful!","just what I needed. I am very satisfied with this product. I just hope it will last because the material is very light and I don't know how sturdy it will be. But so far, just great!"
5,A welcome Chicken,"Think of Ernie Kovacks, Think of early NBC's Saturday Night Live, mix in animation and you have Robot ChickenThis off the wall show spares no one. It don't need character to drive it like South Park. It takes pop culture and turns it on ear.My favorite is the SUPERHERO version of BIG BROTHER. I am still laughingI am depressed, this is only two disks. I WANT MOREBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
3,really undecided,I watched a couple of episodes on TV... and laughed a lot.. decided to get the two set CD..... watched CD 1 for a while... laughed a little...CD 2 (this one) is just as up and down.. but really think this cd should be watched with a group of people... some of it is funny.. some not so funny... I feel that I could have spent my money elsewhere for better value..
4,Hillarious but CENSORED!,"About 3 minutes is missing from ""Vegetable Funfest"" - there's a ""Teen Titans"" sketch which featured Beavis & Butt-head, and apparently MTV/Viacom took issue with this, so the piece was cut from the DVD.Keep your broadcast recordings to see it uncut!"
2,False Advertising,"This set is not uncensored (and in fact bleeps the word ""ass"" out of the commentary). Only 3 of the 12 episodes of Sweet J are on the DVD, and the entire Teen Titans segment from Vegetable Funfest and the Christmas episode were cut."
4,I was dissapointed but it still has its moments.,"I purchased this after watching the two uproariously funny Robot Chicken Star Wars specials. This first season is not nearly as funny. There are moments of course that are just flat out hilarious and others that are simply groan inducing. If you like the show, its a great buy. If you dont, id pass."
5,BEST TV SHOW EVER,THIS IS THE BEST SHOW EVER HILLARIOUS 15 MINUTE SKETCHES THE BEST SHOW ADULT SWIM HAS EVER CAME OUT WITH IT DEFENENTALLY SAVED ADULT SWIM FROM EXTICNTION LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER NEW SHOWS DEFENTALY ORGINAL RECCOMENDED FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES HILLARIOUS 15 MINTUE SKETCHES IF YOU STILL HAVENT SEEN THE SHOW THEN BUY THIS SET OR PRE ORDER SEASON 2 AND OR JUST TAPE IT OFF OF ADULT SWIM THOUGH ITS DUMB THEY NEVER DID A SEASON THREE BUT WHO CARES!!!!!
3,"Pretty funny but when it misses it's mark, it misses hard.........","Alright show. Out of the skits they'll have on each episode, I tend to find that 1 of them will be unbelieveibly funny, another 1 will be alright funny, and the rest will make you wonder why you're watching this program. I'm not some 6 year old nerd coming on this site to give a good show a bad rating to piss everybody off. Trust me this show isn't all what it's hyped up to be. Just like Family Guy, this show is highly overrated while much greater shows like The Venture Bros., Mission Hill, The Boondocks, and Samurai Champloo go unnoticed. It probably is worth the buy but all the episodes have too many skits that aren't funny to make it a really good show. I hope they'll fix it in Season 2. (P.S. I judge every show fairly. I don't just watch 1 episode and judge it. I carefully examine each episode before I make my decission..."
2,NOT the release the fans Expected!,"First of all....in the episode ""Nutcracker Sweet"" in the ""Robo-Served"" Skit the music has been changed (must be due to licensing) all the episodes are NOT uncensored or uncut and there is not Christmas Episode included! - A SERIOUS DISSAPOINTMENT for Robot Chicken fans I was a fan of the show but after this little stunt I am thinking twice about season 2 and beyond!.... if these details don't bother you then by all means you must aquire this release since it does have most the episodes and decent special features."
3,Some funny stuff...,"Robot Chicken is a different show that is much welcomed. It has lots of ideas and they attack lots of different subjects with their stop motion antics.The only minor problem is that because of the young age of its creatorstheir material is often geared at young adults. Yes they do touch subjectsthat older people will reckonize and enjoy. Bottom line, if they expandtheir reach, their audience will also expand. Good creativity.Enjoy"
5,Finally!,"I really like this show beacuse is funny how they make spoof of your favorites movies and shows with black humor sketchs,my favorites sketchs are 3 Fast 3 Furious,Meteorgeddon(a armageddon spoof),The Surrealer Life(a spoof of the lord of the rings trilogy),Kill Bunny(a kill bill vol. 1 & 2 spoof),Big Brother(Freddy Kruger,Jason Vorhees, Leatheface stars into a reallity tv show)and Napoleon Bonamite(a Napoleon Dynamite spoof), one the most noteable thing about Chicken Robot actors and actress like Ashton Kutcher,Burt Reynolds,Topher Grace,Jon Heder,Ryan Seacrest(the presenter of E! News Weekend),Matthew Lillard,Scarlett Johanson, Sarah Michelle Gellar and many others put their voices to some episodes of the show,the dvd contains a lot of good material i can't wait to see the second season of this funny show."
5,Robot Chicken,This DVD set is awesome. It's everything I love about Robot Chicken... I just wish there was more.
5,IT'S ALIVE!,"I stumbled across this show late at night when I was bored out of my mind, I could not believe what I was watching.This is funny, out of control, and random."
5,Robot Chicken Season 1,Excellent DVD set for anyone who is a fan of stop motion and Pop culture. This show is hilarious and has an excellent behind the scenes featurette of how the show started and is created.
5,so ridiculous it has to be hilarious,"I've introduced all my friends here at college to Robot Chicken. It's been a huge hit. Late nights after parties when you're just looking to relax, pop in Robot Chicken and you'll all be laughing hysterically (and even reminisce over all the old toys and pop icons they use). My friends and I can't wait for volume 2 to come out."
1,Awful,"I've seen many of this shows episodes simply because I love Adult Swim overall. I have to say that of all the comedy shows on Adult Swim I find all of them at least slightly amusing except this one. You can say I don't get it, but I love other shows that some people think are awful (Tim and Eric). Every joke in this show is predictable. I've tried to look deeper into the jokes to see if I'm missing something but I don't think so. Seth Green is not funny. This show is just plain awful. The writing (and voice acting) is what makes it so bad. It's like I know what is coming in every scene before it happens, and when it does happen it happens in the most unfunny way possible. How did Seth Green ever become famous?"
2,An honorable but desperate attempt at comedy.,I admire what Seth and company are trying to do with this show but at times it just reeks of desperation to get any kind of a laugh out of you. You may get one quality skit in its 11 minute time span. The show is getting better with every season but this first season shows that they didn't quite figure out what they were trying to do.Their are some inspired skits but not enough to warrant a purchase for this other wise sub par adult swim show.
4,Horror,I get upset when i have to keep reviewing over and over again this is the 3rd time i have done this with this one to and i pray i don't have to keep doing this as before its a so so movie
5,Silver is just another gold.,"This is the 3rd release for Justin Broadrick under the name Jesu. The results are a highly listenable but sonically experimental heavy indie rock record. ""Silver"" is filled with stuff similar to things found on previous releases- low tuned guitars, effect laden vocalizations (check out ""Dead Eyes"" which has Justin going through a vocoder), keys, drum machines and real drums alike (on the title track anyway), loops, feedback, and simple yet orchestrial melodies. Those that might of been put off by Godflesh or previous Jesu releases should consider giving this one a chance. Personally I love them all equally- but this one feels a little more special. I can't wait to hear the next full length. I'm sure it'll be Jesu's best one yet."
4,"Useful to review, not to learn with.","I bought these cards because I already speak Korean and wanted an easy way to keep it in my mind a little bit, so for about an hour twice a week I go through the cards and it actually does help. There is a varied set of vocabulary and even though the romanizations are usually pretty bad, if you can read Korean, then it doesn't really matter. If you do buy these cards, you should realize that some of the definitions use a less common translation. One example of this is pang hyang ??;which they translate as perfume. A better word for perfume is hyang su ??. And a better translation for pang hyang is heading (as in a plane). Other than these seldomly found mistakes these cards are exactly what I wanted."
5,Giogio Armani Emporio Armani She,Completely satisified with this product. Purchased two and my daughters love the fragrance. Very satisfied.
4,"A fast, fun read makes for a great stress reducer.","Writer, Eppie Taylor, lives on a golf course. When a stray ball hurtles through her window crashing into her computer, it sends sparks flying and her beloved cat fleeing the flames that level her home. With her manuscript cremated, we learn her money-hungry agent cares far more about living high on the hog than Eppie's homeless state. Then the millionaire dot-commer that hit the golf ball enters the picture through his lawyer. When all the characters come together it sets in motion a fun, rollicking read that zips along as fast as a well hit golf ball. The agent is a hoot. Before the story ends, the flames of romance are ignited. This is an intelligent read by a writer that may also make a niche for herself as a screenwriter."
3,Another good Mrs. Pollifax outing,"(Based on the audiotape, no longer available (?) )For once Carstairs sends Mrs. Pollifax into the thick of it, to a Swiss spa where some plutonium thieves are thought to lurk. Once again she meddles in side issues, in this case a child who seems strangely frightened, which turns out to be at the heart of the whole situation. This is also where she meets jewel thief Robin and helps turn him to the straight and narrow. Another entertaining outing, well-read by Rosenblat, as usual."
5,Mrs. Pollifax is a Gem,"Dorothy Gillman's books about Mrs. Pollifax are a ""don't miss"" for anyone enjoying a spunky, older woman who works as an undercover spy. I have read all of her books and I would like to get them for my Kindle. Books about Mrs. Pollifax are as good to read the second or third time around! Don't pass up an opportunity to read any of these mysteries."
1,Over-used book,"I bought this as a used book, but it was OVER-USED! There was so much writing in this book by the previous owner that it ruined the book & i hate it"
5,A beautiful book about the Akha,"When Jim Goodman first published Meet The Akha there were few good books giving information or insight into the lives of the Akha.Now with The Akha: Guardians of the Forest, he has once more presented valuable photos and information to the world. Akha children removed to missions will seldom know who they are as portrayed in this book, a beautiful people who shouldn't spend a lot of time apologizing for who they are.Let us all help preserve their culture and protect their human rights.Matthew McDanielThe Akha Heritage Foundation"
5,perfect,"This is a great song! It may be a cover song, but the Wallflowers make it great! I highly recommend that you get this. I got the Godzilla album just for this song cuz I liked it so much. It's the only song that I listen to on that album pretty much."
5,Wallflowers Rule!!!!,"Hey people. I just wanna say that i bought the Godzilla soundtrack because it has the Wallflowers in it and they are the best! I love the song ""Heroes"", it is so cool. You should really get this cd because it's great and you won't regret buying it a such a low price. The Wallflowers have a new cd (or so I heard) coming out on September 2000 so be sure to check that out. In the meantime, keep the Wallflower pride alive, they are the best!"
5,Enriches Daily Living,"I have had the privilege of being a student in two classes with Dr. Stookey. His language is superb, and his insights are unique and expanding. While I have used this as a daily devotional for two years, I find something new each time I meditate on the suggested readings. I give it to friends as a gift often."
5,Wonderful Information,"This book is required reading for my Holistic Nutrition Specialist Certifcation, but I think it is a must read anyone who is interested in nutrition."
4,Great Nutrition Resource,"I've only read the first 150 pages, but so far this book is a wealth of knowledge about nutrition, supported by various scientific studies across the world. It seems like a lay man's equivalent of a nutrition text book. Just what I was looking for!"
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I've been using the phone for 12 months and it hasn't been as good as I initially thought. Granted, this was a top of the line phone a year ago and it wouldn't have been possible to get anything much better.Gripes: (1) Voice quality is not that clear. A colleague also complained about this. (2) It randomly re-boots, including in the middle of calls. Something seriously wrong here. (3) Photos are noisy although this is not unexpected in a fixed-focus device. (4) The 'slider' form-factor is a pest. I found my previous clam-shell phone easier to operate.Update - after 12 months this phone has now been 'scrapped'. No one in the family is interested."
4,Pros and Cons,"I bought this phone in the islands and I really like it. THe sound quality is GREAT and the size and weight are also easy. Also, I like the way it locks when it is carried. Unlike wth razor or other phones where you have to go through a million changes to lock and unlock your phone so that the settings dont change in your pocket; this one is EASY.THe only thing I dont like about this phone is that the menus are a bit cumbersome. Although they are clear, it takes too many steps to get to where you want to go. Nokia does a better job of this."
3,Condensed version for younger readers.,"""Sara Crewe"" is a condensed version of the wonderful classic, ""The Little Princess."" Although the text is written for younger readers, it is no match for the original."
2,ASP Tricks OK,"I have spent a good amount of time working with ASP and other forms of VBscripting. This book has taught a thing or two about ASP, but I believe that it would have been much more useful for me as I was learning to use the technology. I believe this book has little to reveal to experts but it's something very useful to have if you're a casual programmer or teacher.Homer deals with a great number of common ASP problems, errors and how to make scrips more efficient and reliable."
1,It wasn't bound like it was advertised,"It wasn't the binder version which was advertised, which is what I wanted because you can add notes. This is the paperback and not user friendly. I let the person who I bought it from know this and she would not take it back!"
4,Great book!,Anyone who has used this reference knows its a great little book with a bang for your buck. Covers all topics with general information involving diagnosis and treatment. Its a good starter book!
3,Super small print.,"It's a good guide and has good information for students and Vet's. But, It's very hard to read for more than 5 or 10 minutes because of the very small print. Strains your eyes!! I have to scan and enlarge the info. that I most often need to read."
2,"OK, but not entirely accurate","As a quick reference, this book is alright. I am almost finished with clinics, and I found several mistakes in the book throughout the year. The dentistry section has a diagram of the teeth improperly numbered, and in the anesthesia section I found several things that weren't consistent with my vet school's protocols. I feel as though some of the ""information"" in the book is an opinion rather than widely-accepted fact. From what I understand, Dr. Yin created the book from notes she took while in school, so some things may have changed since then. All in all, it's okay, just not my go-to reference."
5,I'm gonna pass Boards!,"Great book, well-organized, easily accessible information, super easy to use. This book is gonna get me through Clinics and Boards."
3,Pretty Good Mystery,"This mystery reminds me of the Agatha Christie novel, And Then There Were None. Guests come to the Mimosa Inn for a ""mock"" murder weekend only to find that one of the actors has actually been murdered. It was interesting to discover all the actors' true identities as their mock ""storylines"" had me convinced that they were someone else. The silly thing about this book is Claire's lack of supervision of her daughter with a murderer running around. Also, I think reading the first novel would be advisable as there is obviously a prior storyline between the Detective and Claire. Overall, it was a fast, light read."
4,A classic Joan Hess mystery!,"Joan Hess, creator of the Maggody series, introduces a new slueth in this amusing romp. Claire Malloy is wonderful as the bored bookstore owner looking for some excitement in her life. Claire's daughter Caron is every mothers' teenaged nightmare. The book provides a great introduction to this series of amateur detective fiction at it's funniest."
5,Amazon Does It Again!~Great Service Great Buy.,"My order arrived when stated, and I am pleased with the condition. Looking forward to continuing reading this series. I have looked at discount book stores, trying to find additional books in several series, and have had no luck finding the older editions that I have not read in a series I accidentally discovered one of the newer books. Thanks for offering these books so I can catch with the series."
2,Beginners Ballet Knowledge Required,"I thought there would be more of an introduction at the beginning. In my opinion, you need at least a beginners knowledge of ballet before using this video. If you have no knowledge of ballet, this might not be the video for you."
5,Loved it!,Half hour segments make it easy to work into my morning routine. Jennifer is a joy to watch and listen too. She sends me dancing through my day.
4,Excellent Parallel Ruler,I have used this ruler for awhile now. The parallelism of the rule is right on. The clear plastic does not distort. The small cork circles do help hold the ruler in place. The small handles are well placed and easy to use. Could not be better.AD2
4,Homunculus is a Roller Coaster...,"Homunculus is a roller coaster of excitement. I think Blaylock may have lived in 18th century London, and might actually know the secret of the carp bladder himself.I have a theory, in fact that James P. Blaylock is none other than his own character Ignacio Narbondo, and these books are simply his own autobiography. Of course he threw us off his trail when he killed himself in the ""Digging Leviathan"".This book, and series is excellent (I'm half way through Lord Kelvin's Machine). However, it's not as good as ""The Elfin Ship"", ""Disappearing Dwarf"" and ""The Stone Giant"". I don't know if these are available any longer, I may have the last copies on earth, but if you can find them, do read them..."
2,Flaky,"I didn't particulary like this book. The characters are either indistinguishable from one another, or completely over the top (or some combination thereof). The villians are stereotypically ridiculous, and there's just way too much fish-gutting for my squeamish tastes. May I suggest The Anubis Gates instead?"
4,An entertaining romp,"This book is not for the faint of heart for it involves fish-guts, dead/undead bodies, and on top of that it involves 1870's London.On the other hand, it has entertaining characters ranging from hunchbacks to crazed priests to tinkers and intellectuals. The language tends to get a bit thick, but this better serves to describe the oddness that entails within.If you prefer your tales a bit more serious this may not be the book for you. However, if you do enjoy the occasional weird event or humorous encounter this book is great!"
2,Horribilus,"""Homonculus"" is Blaylock's unhappy attempt to maintain apace with his friends Tim Powers and K.W. Jeter, at a time when each was writing a pastiche set in a London of the 19th century. Jeter produced the amusing and strange ""Infernal Devices"", Powers wrote the now-legendary and award-winning ""Anubis Gates"" and Blaylock, well, Blaylock wrote this mess.James Blaylock seems to suffer from the worst kind of Chris Columbus fantasy imaginings. Plot slowing down? Throw in a big, anachronistic machine! Don't waste time with character development, just dress 'em up and make 'em talk funny. That'll do it.Overall, Blaylock seems unable to rise above mediocrity."
1,ME's not for you,"This is strictly material for anyone authoring a biography of Peter Gabriel. It's an old interview from the early 80's, and not particularly enlightening even from a research point-of-view. No music of any kind on this disc... Just talking."
3,"Images are charming, but the content is not clear.","""There's a party today for Winnie the Pooh! Let's tag along and learn shapes, too!"" This sweet little board book captures babies attention with a pleasantly rhythmic beat while teaching shapes: circle, square, rectangle, triangle, heart, oval, diamond, and star. The illustrations are charming and appeal to young children, however, the text does not reference the individual shapes as a reinforcing teaching tool. For instance, the word SQUARE is placed next to the ""square shaped blocks"", but does not appear in the text itself. Emphasizing the word to the shape facilitates better learning, and the reason why this book receives a three star review. ""Shapes,"" is not my favorite in the Learn and Grow Board Book series, however, the images are charming, and the prose is pleasing. Birth and up.As a recommendation, Julie Aigner-Clark's, ""See and Spy Shapes"" by The Baby Einstein Company is an excellent book for teaching shapes."
5,All you every wanted to know about roadsters,"I got this while waiting for my 1969 Datsun to be shipped from California. It's good eye candy, decent reference, and a great view of how the car was percieved when still available new. I'd recommend it for anyone considering this neat little car."
4,great for preschoolers,"The Children's Choice video collection has many different young children's books come alive on video. Many of the stories included are classics or Caldecott Award winning books. Some book titles include, ""Where the Wild Things Are"", ""The Mysterious Tadpole"", ""Danny the Dinosaur"", ""Caps for Sale"" and ""A Story, A Story"". The videos use music, sound effects and great narrators to bring the stories alive. My four-year old son loves to sing-along to the ""Come on along..."" opening song. He likes to read along in his books as the story unfolds on the video. He runs to the video section of the library and we always bring home a ""Come on along"" video home with us."
4,"Cheap, easy","Fairly reliable, durable, under continuous daily use we go through 2 to 4 units a year. Light Duty is good enough for daily use, who would have guessed?"
1,Very out of date,"I actually followed the mead making instructions written by the authors in my first attempt to make a batch of basic mead. A complete waste of honey. The fermentation barely started and finally fizzled out after about six months with most of the honey still unfermented. I later found out (from another book listed here on Amazon in which the word ""complete"" is misspelled to read ""compleat,"" that honey is slightly acidic and ADDING more acid (as recommended by these authors)actually retards fermentation explaining my results.I'm not sure when this pamphlet written, but my copy is dated 1990 and it notes that it entered it's sixteenth printing in 1984. Apparetnly an awful lot has been learned about honey and mead making since then and I would strongly recommend NOT using this outdated information. It might just convince you that mead making is impossible, but it's actually fairly easy (much easier than beer making for example) and fun!"
1,Problems with Fedora (Core 6 and 10),"Bought this to enable me to use a 1 TB eSATA drive (WD Office Edition) with Fedora. I had to update the firware when I got it. It was running the latest from Sabrent, but SIL had a newer one. Otherwise it would just hang on bootup when it detected an attached FW drive. Fedora picks up the card and the drive, but it starts throwing errors and drops the eSATA link after running for a bit. I was originally running Fedora Core 6, so I upgraded to Fedora 10 to see if the SATA drivers might have been part of the problem, but I still got the same problem. I thought it might be the cable and not getting a good connection to the eSATA drive (the cable shield seems to keep it from going all the way into the eSATA drive port on the WD), but that wasn't it. I gave up on the eSATA and am just using FW400. It's more reliable and built-in to the system. I'll probably just junk this card as it's not worth returning it for a refund."
2,Wish it were more realistic,"I am a newlywed who was given this book by my mother as a gift and to help us start off on the right foot. Neither myself nor my husband have much experience cooking. This book has wonderful pictures but the recipes are way to hard. If you are experienced, this book may work for you but if you really are a beginner, look for something more practical."
5,Seasoned cook,"I have been cooking for nearly 40 years. This is by far the best cookbook I have ever owned. I usually use recipes as a guideline and add my own touch. Rarely do I follow the recipe exactly and my friends think my cooking is chef quality. Having said that, this cookbook is so fantastic I follow the recipes and have been very very pleased. My daughter-in-law gave me this book when I asked for the recipe for the dinner she cooked (fajitas, delicious!) I bought a second book for my lake home so no matter which home I am at I have access to these recipes. Give it, buy it, use it, you will love it."
2,Maybe in a few years,"I wish I could recommend this book a little higher because it is very beautiful. And I wish that I could make more of the recipes in this book because the pictures of the finished dishes look beautiful as well. But I'm not a chef and I'm not a caterer, I'm a beginning cook and while I do have patience and desire to learn to cook, I don't have hours each evening to prepare dinner.I'm hoping to use this book in the future when I have a little more experience under my belt. I think it's a little misleading because it represents itself as a cookbook to help you learn how to cook. If I had received this as a gift, I may not have been so disappointed but this was quite an investment for a cookbook."
2,I thought it was okay,"The pictures are great - I mean the book is really beautiful! The dishes are a little on the gourmet side to me. Like if I were staying at the little bed and breakfast down the street, they might serve a lot of this stuff. Which is great, but I was hoping to have more everyday type stuff. It's really pretty though :)"
5,JUST FOR TWO,"Although I have been married for an eternity, I really love those recipes created mostly for 2. Very nice and almost simple dishes I had forgotten. Love the coconut rice."
4,"For a more intimate present, you may want to try . . .","I am an avid, but amateur chef and am getting married in Fall 05. I've looked at a number of bride-groom cookbooks. So far, my favorite is NOT ON LOVE ALONE by Jessie Carry Saunders. It has a friendlier, more intimate tone than any of the others -- it feels like something written by a bride for other brides.It has a friendly, appealing feel, like the author is in the kitchen with you, telling you stories about the recipes as she teaches you how to make them. Also, it's just a higher quality book -- it's a hard cover, the pages are nice and thick, and the watercolor illustrations on every page make the book seem like something you could display on your coffee table as easily as you could use it in the kitchen.If you want a good cookbook, any of the various newlywed cookbooks will work fine. If you want an excellent present for a wedding or a bridal shower, my recommendation is NOT ON LOVE ALONE."
2,Not Very Practical,"To me, this was more of a ""gourmet"" type cookbook. Pretty to look at, but not very practical. Especially for someone just learning to cook. For instance, the recipe ""Pork Tenderloin With Mango Salsa and Blackberry Syrup"", the recipe calls for Rasberry Vinegar. Perhaps they have that at a specialty store, but I've never seen it at the stores I shop. Another recipe ""Chicken With Prosciutto, Fontina, and Mushroom Sauce"". I don't even know what Prosciutto is, and I've never heard of Fontina Cheese. Anyway, you get my point. Phyllis"
5,Use this book at least once a week!,"This is a wonderful cookbook. I have been married 5 years and still use this cookbook on a weekly basis! If you aren't a great cook, this cookbook will give you a chance to try new cuisine at a moderate level. The recipes are delicious, and the dessert section is especially a great resource for any new wife!!"
1,Romantic Collection - France,The actual CD does NOT have the same titles that the advertisement claims.I specifically purchased this for my French wife who wanted to hear Lucienne Delyle's 'Domino' however the CD does not have this track nor another that is advertised. There are 19 tracks on the CD and 21 advertised on the website.VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON.
2,Same old same old -- sounded like on repeat same song,"I purchased this cd after listening to two tracks that came on my new laptop which I loved, but didn't realize all the ""Childrens Songs"" would have me skipping over them on my iPod any time I heard the tinkling vibraphone over and over. I've deleted all these tracks from my playlist and continue to listen to the two tracks which were not reflective of the rest of the album."
4,CrÃ³nica gallega de una EspaÃ±a...,"Para aquellos de nosotros fieles a nuestros voceros literarios e histÃ³ricos, La Cruz de San Andres se presenta como una crÃ³nica de la EspaÃ±a gallega sÃ³lo en sus detalles puesto a que desenmascara una rica variedad de personajes que son alumbrados tanto por su papel en la vida de la protagonista como por sus aventuras y particularidades.El libro merecedor del Premio Planeta por un escritor luego galardonado con el Premio Nobel forma parte de una tradiciÃ³n literaria que deja al lector buscando la siguiente novela del mismo escritor.La manera en que esta compuesto el texto tiene algunas similitudes con el libro de Gabriel Garcia Marques:""El otoÃ±o del Patriarca"" en el sentido de que vuelve a los mismos circulos y seÃ±ala brevemente eventos histÃ³ricos.Es un libro que se disfruta y pasa a complementar las propuestas escritas espaÃ±olas."
1,warmer at best no star is more appropriate,"this is amazing,I can't possibly understand the creation of this product,it would make a nice warmer for a buffet but to actually COOK with it you'd need to have a whole lot of patience,I'll just go to Ebay and get the ever-reliable FARBERWARE grills that actually get HOT (quite necessary where cooking is involved) this is ridiculous."
2,Smokeless--on what planet?,"I desperatly wanted to love this grill. I had visions of ordering them as Christmas presents for my entire family later this year. Sadly, I doubt I'll get much use out of it.I'm experienced with indoor grilling, and I followed the directions to the letter. I turned my exhaust fan on high, placing the grill directly under it, yet my apartment was filled with smoke. Even after cleaning the grill and the entire kitchen it stinks in here. I've sprayed air freshners and can still smell it.If I can't cook simple hamburgers on it without setting off the smoke alarm and having to air the place out for days, what use is it to me.Two other things are troubling. The thermostat dial is too vague, making it hard to determine at what temperature your grill is functioning and the ridiculously shallow drip pan makes emptying it an Olympic sport.I'll try it again, using a higher tolerance cooking spray, but I don't hold out much hope for success and certainly wouldn't recommend it."
3,Not at all what expected.,"I brought this grill thinking that could really help me in the kitchen,but you food will be dry an burnt before its done.do not like it at all, gave it to my son."
2,Not worth it!,Used it one time....And 1 year later ( TODAY ) I sold it for 20 bucks at a yard sale!! doesent get hot enough! and takes long to cook meat! So now we just grill in the yard only...no need for indoor hassel!
2,I Sent It Back,"I sent the grill back without using it because it is so slim top to bottom that the bottom was practically sitting on my counter top. The only thing separating the heating element from the counter top was a thin metal tray about an inch off the counter. With the tray itself causing heat transfer, this was a disaster waiting to happen (IMHO). In order to keep from causing heat damage to my counter, I would have had to sit it on my stove top (not enough room) or on top of something heat resistant (don't have). I'm not sure why Sanyo didn't think to make the body of the grill higher, but it was a definite deal breaker for me. I was happy that Amazon took the grill back without question and gave me an instant refund."
4,I love my grill!,"I love this grill! It is perfect for smaller families and especially nice that you dont have to go outside and start a huge grill for just a small piece of chicken or something. It has a nice size cooking surface and seems to cook everything evenly. My only complaint for it is that it doesnt have a lid, however, I have been using a disposable lasagna platter for a makeshift lid and it works quite well."
3,used it once,"I used this once ...and can't say i didn't like it. It just wasn't so ""wow"" that I've ever thought of using it again. I have moved to an urban condo where I can't grill on my patio. So, i really missed grilling...can't say this gave me that fix."
2,Worked OK for only two years,Bought this for replacement of a Farberware grill purchased twenty-five years ago. This grill only lasted two years before the heating element failed.
4,Electric Indoor Barbeque Grill,"Sanyo HPS-SG3 200-Square-Inch Electric Indoor Barbeque Grill, BlackThe size is big enough to do just about anything one want's to cook. But when it comes time to clean it, is is to big for my sink, so cleaning does take some time by hand. While it says it's smokeless, it sometimes fills the house with smoke while cooking. When the time comes to replace it, I will be looking for another way to cook stuff inside."
4,Great indoor grill,"We've only used our Sanyo grill a few times but have found it to be extremely easy to use and are very pleased with the meals prepared on it. Yes, it takes a few minutes to preheat but not excessive....and the cleanup is not as easy as I'd like but still not too much trouble. I definitely would recommend this indoor grill to my family & friends."
4,Works well,This is not a bad grill. Unlike the Forman grills your meat must be 100% thawed before you cook on this grill. I cook for 4 people on here and some times 5 and it has enough room for all of us.
4,Sanyo Indoor Grill Great,"Too cold to grill out -- thought I'd try this indoor grill. Hamburgers, hot dogs, and steaks have turned out great. Sure beats going out in the cold or rain for that grilled flavor! My 23 year old grandson liked mine so much, I ordered him one as a Christmas gift."
4,Bought another one for my Vegan sister,"I bought this a few years ago when i lived in an apartment and it woorked great. Genuis idea to whoever came up with it. I love to make the burgers and sausages and grill chicken and skirt steaks, and I never thought it could be used for anything else. Last week, I bought one for my sister who is a strict vegan along with a vegetarian grilling cookbook. She absolutely loves it. She said that the tofu kebabs came out great and she like the searing that came out on the veggies and tofu. She also tried some vegan sausages which tasted better on the grill than in the pan.She also grills bread and adds soy butter on it."
4,review,"It works pretty well, sometimes though the food does not cook evenly. It is worth it when you live in a place where the weather does not always allow you to do outdoor BBQing"
3,Not so easy to clean...,"The grill heated up a lot quicker then everyone's reviews said it would. However, I found it very difficult to clean. You don't just have to clean the top, each grill line by grill line, but you also have to clean underneath and the grease got all over the underside of the grill. The drip pan was easy enough to clean. It definitely got the oil out of the food and the food has the grill stripes like it should, but without the charcoal or propane it just doesn't taste like grilled food. For what they say it should do, it does the job satisfactoraly..."
2,It looks like a BBQ grill but looks aren't everything!,If you are thinking this item to be sizzling alternative to a conventional BBQ grill... think again. It is not. It seems to be good as a hot dog cooker.
3,Too big for apartment dwellers,"I purchased this for a party and it worked fine. The temperature controller doesn't keep the temperature steadily but it's hot enough to grill after around 5-10 minutes.The problem crawled in after the party. I live in an apartment and still have quite a lot of storage space (with IKEA cabinet). But there's no proper space to keep this bulky animal. I assume that the product doesn't have to be this big, and most buyers probably someone who live in a smaller space like myself. I would doubt that people with backyard with a fancy barbecue grill will need this. Simply it's too bulky. So, if you consider buying it, I recommend checking your storage ability in the kitchen first."
2,O K,"It's OK would not buy again. You have to overcook/burn the outside, because takes long time to cook inside. If you like a bloody steak in the middle you'll love it."
3,OK grilling.,this Print is OK. I think I still have to get the hand of it. Every time I cook with it my steaks are tough or my chicken is dry. I guess practice make perfect. It's actually my husband's gift and he is still trying to work it out also.
1,Arrived Broken,"Sadly. my Sanyo Electric Grill arrived broken and had to be returned. There were no more in stock, so I cannot review the product."
1,too big,I purchased this item because I had other brands and was always satisified but unable to find them again. When I saw that this item was almost the same I bought it only to find that it was extremely too big to fit on any of my counter tops. I returned it immediately.
5,This thing is a beast,"Anyone who complains about a $40 grill this big having cheap plastic parts is missing the point entirely. I dropped the power plug within the first few days and the temperature dial broke, but that's my fault for dropping it. After a while I just got used to figuring out how exactly to adjust the temperature without the dial. I have never had any of the plastic parts melt on me. This thing is enormous and is low enough on the smoke (depending on what I'm cooking) not to choke me in my tiny apartment. The most important aspect of it of course is how well it cooks, which is great. You just can't beat it for the price and the size."
4,It needs a top!,"I *love* this grill but it needs a top to hold in heat and to make it cook faster. We have used it grill everything from chicken to fish and it does a very good job. The surface is big enough to hold several pieces of meat to feed a family of four. It really needs a top though, and if you can tolerate the smoke in your kitchen and imagine that it's the smell of an outdoor barbeque, you'll love the grill"
5,Sanyo Indoor Grill excellence,I like the grill because it is simple to use and simple to clean. Also I like a big enough surface to cook for the company and free shipping. Thank you Amazon.
3,You get what you pay for,"After having this unit for about 6 months, I can say that it will not replace the outdoor grill, or the indoor frying pan, but I guess I had high expectations. Still, the grill works, and I'll use it when in a pinch.Cons:I think the biggest detriment is the lack of a lid. Without one, the grill takes a about 15 minutes to cook 1/4"" patties of ground beef on the highest setting. I've improvised, and have been using the lid from my portable Weber gas grill and it helps significantly. Finally, I have found that the grill is anything but smoke free, and produces a lot of smoke and odor.Pros:The price for this grill is outstanding. It heats up pretty quickly, and is easy to take apart and clean."
5,Works Great!,I bought this grill as a gift for my cousin...I have to tell you he just loves it! Easy clean up...multiple temperature levels...no complaints here!
3,Does a great job,"Cooking - this is great. One big down side is its size. The plastic tray is HUGE and will not even fit into the dishwasher. So, storing it is a bit of a pain."
3,Good Idea but..,"Unlike older styles with the heating element under the grill, this sanyo SG3 has a non stick grill that is the heating element. Less parts, less to cleanup, I thought great idea and bought one. On my first try I already notice the flaw; The food has to touch the grill to cook properly. Any food that curls will be a problem to cook properly. Anything thats thin and flat cooks fine. If this product pumped out more heat it would be perfect."
3,Not hot enough,"It is ok product for the price but I found out it was not the right grill for the cuisine that enjoy which is Turkish. It takes forever the grill shish kebabs, adana kebabs, koftes, chicken drums, eggplants, green peppers, onions etc.But if you like to grill hot dogs and thin sliced chicken breasts, you are lucky. You can do it on this as long as they are not thick.The problem I see is that it is just not hot enough. Maybe none of the electric grills is hot enough. That is why I gave up on electric grills and planning on going with gas grill when I have the enough money to purchase one."
5,great buy,"Sanyo has really set the bar high with this one! As a father of two little ones I am cooking all of the time and as anyone with kids knows that time is a rare commodity. After cooking up Mac & cheese with green beans for the 14th day in a row, I'm finally able to break the monotony and make something good for a change. Winters are long and I don't like going outside when its 5 degrees, even to grill. This grill from sanyo is definately a lifesaver in our home. Unlike other kitchen appliances that notoriously sit in a cabinet for months on end, this is becoming a permanent fixture.It heats up fast and any smoke coming from it is a non issue, unless your burning your food. In short, this is a well built, high quality machine that I would not do without. Way to go Sanyo!!!!"
4,Sanyo HPS-SG3 200-Square-Inch Electric Indoor Barbeque Grill,"GREAT FAST DELIVERY, WORKS GREAT! ONLY THING BE CAREFULL WHEN USING IT ON THE COUNTER, IT REALLY HEATS UP AND IS HOT."
4,Grilling inside during Cold weather,"Have only used the electric grill once, but enjoyed it. Seared the meat nicely, tho took longer than on charcoal grill. Even got the sear marks on the meat...which psychologically, seems to makes the meat taste better. The water in the plater underneath the grill seems to capture any smoke, as well as taking in the ""grease"" from the meat. Cleaning the pan was easy. Cleaning the grilling area easy. Would recommend the pan for ""winter use"" when an outside grill not convenient. Better than pan frying and only a little more effort in clean up. Does a better job than the George Foreman Grills."
4,"Great, especially for the price","This was a good purchase. The grill has enough space to cook multiple items for a few people and it has a pretty good temperature range. We don't have a deck outside, so it was good to have a grilled steak again. Make sure to spray the grate with cooking spray and it is pretty easy to clean."
4,I love it --- but....,I really love using my Sanyo grill. The only drawback is that it's difficult to empty the greasy water in the drip pan after cooking. It says to cover the bottom of the drip pan with water. But that takes so much water that there's no way to remove it later without spilling it.
2,Don't waste your money,"I opened the box today with great anticipation having read the other reviews, put my marinated chicken pieces on the hot pre-heated grill and cooked and cooked and cooked. After 90 minutes, the inside of the chicken was still way under- cooked (thermometer 110 degrees). The outside was great, but I ended up putting the chicken into the oven for 20 minutes more to finish it up. Had I not dropped the grill on my foot, breaking off a piece of the handle (cheap plastic and lots of it), I would have returned the item. It just doesn't hold the heat evenly or continuously. However, putting the water under the grill as instructed did eliminate all the smoke, and if it cooked evenly it would have been great."
3,underpowered,"this grille is ok,but not great!!good for hamburgers and small thin pieces of meat,but is not hot enough to do a good job on a ribeye steak!!it doesn't get hot enough to sear the meat,which is very important for a nice juicy result.also the non-stick on the grille surface comes off with a scotch brite pad!!to me that is unsatisfactory!!!"
3,"Good grill, but it's a little big for the table","I picked this up thinking i could use it for a table top grill for Korean style grilling. The grill itself works great, and it's not that bad when cleaning, but i think it's a little too big for my table. I may buy the smaller one.I'm sure it's great if you have a big island in the kitchen."
3,Too big,Too big for the shelf and counter. Food doesn't cook properly.Burnt on the outside and raw on the inside.If you put it on low the food will never get cooked.
1,sanyo grills quits after 1 use,Sanyo grill stopped working after 1 use. Heat control failed to work. Needless to say I won't be buying any more sanyo products.
3,before i buy,is this really smokeless? cause i don't have a balcony and want to grill in my apartment. so is this really smokeless? someone please verify to me. thanks.
4,Sanyo Indoor Electric Grill,"I have grilled corn on the cob (in the husks). It was great! Also grilled asparagus, chicken, shrimp and steak. The grill was easy to clean and the kitchen did not get as hot as when I use the oven or broiler."
3,Not Smokless But Cooks Great,"I live an an apartment that has a kitchen vent that recirculates the air back into the room. I ordered this unit hoping I could grill food and that it would be ""smokeless."" Not so. This unit produces less smoke, but it still smokes. Interestingly the box does not say ""smokeless."" I gave it 3 stars because it does a great job cooking the food. A couple of reviewers mentioned the problems with emptying the drip tray. I also experienced this. To resolve this problem, I lined the inside of the base and drip pan with heavy duty aluminum foil. This creates a drip pan that is 2"" deep. Problem solved.I returned this unit to Amazon. Wish I could have kept it but it did not work for my situation."
4,Can't go wrong for the price!,"We purchased this unit as an alternative to the George Forman grill we've had for several years. The main reason, the G.F. weighs a ton. They are not comparable so I will focus on the Sanyo. I've used it several times and I like it. It's extremely light weight and takes up little counter space when in use. The drip pan is a plus but just a bit too shallow. A little deeper would make it easier to get that water to the sink. It does take a good 20 minutes or so to get to full heat and since you are cooking on one side (without a hood) a 1"" piece of meat will take a while. I have to agree with some of the reviewers that claim that the grilling surface tends to ""gum up"". I'm experimenting with different oils to see which one works best. That said, we use it at least once a week and overall we are quite satisfied with the product especially for the price."
5,review,"I think the indoor grill is great, it meets all of my expectations, I have recommended it to friends. I know of 1 person who ordered, she is completely satisfied."
1,Wimpy,This grill does not get hot enough to cook in a reasonable period of time. I took the chicken off and cooked it myself in a pan on the stove because after the recommended cooking time at the recommended temp it was still pink inside. I returned it. Too bad.
1,Very disappointed.,"I purchased three of this, one for myself, and two as gifts. After reading such great reviews I thought it'd be a good investment. Wrong. The product does not live up to its reviews. It is the biggest disappointment. I used to live with my parents and they have the best indoor grill so I figured I want one for myself since I love to grill. Here are reasons to not buy this product.1. It is like the George Foreman grill. Why is this bad? Well, when you cook meat products it does not taste like how it should taste when you would cook it on an outdoor grill. It is not at all a grilled taste.2. It heats up really slow. I mean S-L-O-W! Not only that it doesn't heat up high enough to cook a thin slice of steak. You would probably spend more than 4 hours for one piece of thinly cut steak.3. Just don't get it. It is a waste of time and money."
2,A bit disappointed,"I purchased this item to be able to grill during the winter months when it's too cold to be outside. It looks very nice and clean up is super easy. The problem seems to be in what you decide to grill on it.The first time I used it, I grilled chicken breasts and they turned out fine and by keeping water in the drip pan, I had no problem with smoke.This is great, I thought. The next time I grilled hamburger patties and even though I followed the same procedure as before, it smoked up my whole house. (these were not high fat content burgers either) I added more water to the pan thinking it may have not been enough and it continued to smoke even more. It was not a pleasant experience. Right now it is sitting on top of my fridge and it may stay there until I decide to give it one more try. If it fairs better next time I will return and give it a better review..maybe."
4,Great inexpensive grill,"This is a great smokeless grill. Very light weight, all most to light! Mine dropped and the handle broke off. I can still use it but hate that its damaged.It cooks hamburgers super. Grill marks and taste. I love it for a quick easy no mess dinners. I've cooked pork chops,hamburgers and steaks and its great. Spray little Pam on the grill and its cleans up great. I recommend this."
5,Love it,"I came across this grill (or one looked like it) on Martha Stewart show when one of her guest grilled the steak and it looked so good. It gave me the idea for simple & painless indoor grilling. I did some research and finally ordered this light weight Sanyo grill from Amazon for my condo in Hawaii. I loved it, and now I'm thinking about to order a second one for my other house. I had a couple of friends over for dinner last night,saw it,loved it,and they came home ordered one too. It gave out very little smoke if you remember to fill the tray with water. Cleaning is very easy, just soap & water & sponge. The dial is little difficult to read when you're doing dozen things at once but really no big deal for me, I just fooled around a bit and got it to the right temperature. Nothing is perfect anyway, definitely it's the best value you can find out there. Buy it."
4,Great grill!,I use this thing about 3 times a week and love it. It's pretty easy to clean and doesn't take up much room.
5,Love This Grill,This grill is so like grilling outdoors. The food is moist and juicy. The cleanup is a dream.Would recommend this to my friends.
2,No grilled flavor...disappointed!,"We bought this to get a nice, easy grilled flavor. The grill marks are nice to look at, but because no juices fall on the element, there is NO grill flavor. I would return it if possible and go for one with the heating element UNDER the food. Not a good buy for us."
3,nice product,Takes a while to eat up to max. Cooks great...Empting the water pan is a pain in the rear. Would be easier if the pan was stronger
4,Family Grill,"This is big enough to feed a family of 6. Love the non stick top. The only down fall is that the other side of the grill, your food will stick to it, it is a pain to clean, spray it with PAM or another spray and you will not have that problem. Otherwise a great grill."
3,Ginormous,"The grill is absolutely huge. It works well, cooks the food evenly. But did I mention that it is HUGE? Way too big for family dinner. Cleaning it is also a major pain because of the size. Trying to manipulate a big drip pan full of water and grease is a major undertaking. I have yet to empty the thing without spilling it all over. Grill is too big for the dishwasher so you're making a committment to hand washing. Does not work for me. 3 stars because it grills well (and because it's my fault for not checking out the dimensions before I purchased), but I donated it to my church and I'm going for something smaller and easier to clean."
5,Lovable,I already used it 3 times an really love it. I will let my freinds and family know about this grill.
3,"Overall, pretty impressed.","Overall, I was impressed with this grill--especially the heat it generated to cook. Unfortunately, shortly after I got it I dropped it on the floor and broke it! I replaced it with a DeLonghi grill because it had a deeper grilling area. I found the food fell off the Sanyo grill pretty easily. Haven't found the DeLonghi grill as efficient with heat. If I could combine the two grills I would really be happyI"
1,not a good grill,"Even with water in drip pan, it still smokes too much (sets off smoke detectors). Takes too long (over 30 min) to grill brats."
2,Indoor Grill No Thrill,The indoor grill does not generate enough heat to do a good job of cooking meat that has a fair amount of thickness to it. It takes too long to cook most items and the unit is not made very sturdy.
4,Easy to use,I just used mine for the first time last night for cooking turkey burgers. It was really easy to set up and clean up. The only problem I had was pouring out the water from the grease tray with out spilling it. I may have put too much water in the bottom. The cool down was pretty quick so it didn't have to sit out too long to clean it. This grill is large so be prepared if you have limited counter space that it will take up some space. It did smoke a little but no more than what a George Foreman would produce. It is disappointing that you don't get that outdoor grill taste but the burgers were well cooked and pretty moist. It's a great product and works well if you don't have an opportunity to grill outside.
5,Skeptical,"I had one of the first indoor electric grills many years ago, it was messy, smoky and hard to clean, I was skeptical about this Sanyo grill. What a pleasant surprise! This grill is AWESOME! The price is very reasonable, no smoking during the cooking process, heats up quickly and the clean up is so easy, most of the cooked on frime sprays off with water, just takes a quick wipe a soap and cloth to finish the job. Light weight and low profile makes storage a breeze! I highly recommend this grill for any indoor cooking solution!"
4,Very pleased!,"I couldn't believe how big this grill is! Yep I read the description, but my math skills didn't help to translate the reality. However, despite the size it's super light. Plus it will actually fit a full meal for five. It has the hotter/colder spots I expect from any grill, but that's why you rotate everything. Very easy set-up and clean-up, only problem I'm having is finding a good place to store it. Great product, especially for the price. We're really pleased!"
3,Sanyo Indoor Grill,"It took longer to reach a specific temperature than anticipated. Water in the tray below the grill is difficult to empty when there is a lot left after cooking. Cooked meat & vegies well. Flavor doesn't compare to a charcoal method, which was to be expected so the term ""Barbeque"" should be eliminated."
5,Great Product,"This is the most wonderful product, that is according to my wife, whom l bought this for. lt is well made, and does just as the advertisement say's it will do, she uses it 3 to 4 times a week. If your in the market for something like this, this is the one to buy."
2,Slow Cook Time,This grill is very slow to cook and was a disappointment. I tried a hamburger and two hot dogs and it took a half hour to cook. The hamburger was done and the hot dogs were luke warm. I would suggest getting a better model if you want a normal cooking experience.
2,Sanyo indoor griller - not impressive in Australia,"We have bought two of these indoor grillers, via Amazon, as they are not available here in Australia. The first one worked well the first time, but when I washed it later, it didn't work again. An electrician had a look at it and said that the element had 'blown' as evidenced by a burn mark about half way around the element. I thought it was because of the way I'd washed it but now I think the element was defective. About three months later I bought another unit, the exact same model. When it was turned on, it went POP and a small flame was seen at the same place on the element where the burn mark on the previous unit had appeared. Amazon refunded the purchase and shipping costs.I didn't make as claim for the first unit as I thought it was my fault but now I don't think it was.I got the impression that the power 240volts in Australia is too strong for these units.Sanyo HPS-SG3 200-Square-Inch Electric Indoor Barbeque Grill, Black"
4,"I really like this grill, cooks good, cleans easy and stores well.","I really like this grill, cooks good, cleans easy and stores well. I have to use it on the sink, though, as the pan that holds the water underneath isn't very deep and spills over easily. But it gives me an alternative to baking and frying, without all the calories and still has a good grill taste."
4,Sanyo Electric Indoor Grill,I have always wanted an indoor grill and when this one popped in up an email I went looking for a good price. I found one on Amazon and after looking at the different models decided to purchase this one. I have only used it once so far (grilled chicken) which cooked in the time the guide book stated it would. Which is longer than it would take on a gas or charcoal grill. It will take a little experimenting to get used to cooking directly on a regulated heat source but other than that I was completely satisfied. No smoke from cooking and cleanup was very easy. I will be using this grill more often now that the weather iscooler.
5,Big and awesome,"I don't often review products on Amazon because I'm not really inspired to do so. But I absolutely love this grill. It is big and cumbersome to store, but it is fantastic. I have grilled hamburgers, sausage, steak, and chicken on it, all without ""smoking"" that my old indoor grill caused. It is so easy to clean. And the temperature control gives me so much power to cook as quickly or as slowly as I need. The grill gets really hot, but the outside does not. It's just so nice to have the ability to grill foods well indoors during the winter!"
4,Good,"For an indoor grill, it does pretty good. I make carne asada, steak, chicken and porck chops on it and they turn out pretty decent. Hot dogs on the other hand? Not to much."
4,GOOD GRILL,"Used grill for first time, did not take long to heat up (quicker than my deepfryer), easy clean-up and little to no smoke for burgers. However, if you are single or a couple, this grill may be too big, get the SG2 which is smaller. I cooked four burgers and it is really to big for that."
1,NOT non-stick at all,"This grill was a great disappointment. It's coating holds on to food very tenaciously, and it takes a tremendous amount of scrubbing to clean it - so much so that I finally just threw it away, since the return period had elapsed. If you cook at low temperatures, it's OK, but real high-heat grilling is not this products forte."
2,I am disappointed,"I love my old Farberware and have been trying to find something equally good, but less trouble to use. I have purchased and given away several grills in this quest.First, this Sanyo is way too big for two people and is also a problem when it comes to storage.However, my biggest complaint is that it doesn't get sizzling hot and takes a very long time to heat up. I have left mine for 30 minutes hoping to see the light go off at 425 deg., but it never happens. Maybe 400 deg. if I'm lucky.I do like the hint from someone else which says to put newspaper in the bottom and then pour water over that. It certainly makes cleanup a lot easier.Would not buy this again. I will continue to treasure my old Farberware."
4,"Great Grill, But know how to clean...","Great Indoor Grill. Love it. My only caveat is that it takes some time to clean, the bottom gets very grimy from the grease but the quickest and best way I found is to use the sponges with the green rough pad on the bottom, I forget the brand but they work great on the non stick side.After a few uses I have found it easy enough to clean and have a routine. Portable as well. Great Product."
2,mccarron,hi i got asanyo HPS-SG3 grill the first one burnt out the 3 time i used it. The 2 one went on fire and knocked of the power. there is a fult in them would be a good item if it worked. seamus mccarron.
2,Not what I expected,"All it is, it's like a George Foreman type grill. Only thing it is good for is grill marks, you do not get a grilled flavor or anything."
4,Indoor Grill,I was disappointed that the chicken thighs did not do well on the grill. Took too long to cook. But the steaks turned out excellent. It does what it says it will do.
5,Love it!,"At first I was going to get the smaller one (it's just my husband and I) but I'm so glad I bought the larger one. Now I can have guests over and grill a steak for everyone at the same time. I haven't had this very long but I sure use it a lot. It's easy to clean, light weight, and works great! With beautiful grill marks to make your dinner look even more appetizing. I marinated 4 boneless/skinless chicken breasts in a teriyaki sauce last night and grilled them for dinner, the chicken came out juicy and tender w/beautiful grill marks. And with the non stick surface they slid right off the grill. So if you're thinking of buying one, buy it here at Amazon at only $39.99 that was the best price I found anywhere."
5,Love it!,I am so happy with this purchase! It's very easy to take apart and it's nonstick surface is a breeze to clean. I used to have a smaller Sanyo grill when it was just the two of us and this one is perfect for the large family meals now. I can cook 10 burgers at once. There's more than enough room for 4 large steaks or 4 large flattened boneless chicken breasts.
5,Grill me crazy!,"This is a great indoor grill. We use it to cook korean food since a number of Korean dishes, such as bulgoki and galbi(short ribs,) are designed to be grilled. Food tastes much better than cooking it in the oven, and it's simple to clean up, too."
3,Sanyo HPS-SG3 Electric Indoor BBQ Grill,- Not enough depth on the grill; items can tend to slide off too easily- No cover/lid
4,Great indoor grill,"this indoor grill is large and fantastic! Food comes out great on it! It is a little clumsy trying to wash and store because of it's size. I've had some issues with it smoking when I am cooking marinated or BBQed meats, but I expect that. I just open a window a crack to pull it out. I'll take that over standing over the outdoor grill in the winter any time :)"
5,Great grill But?,"We like the grill, but it is a pain to clean after use. All in all a good buy. I am happy with the quality. We have had it for over a year and love it. Quality.Plus."
5,Sanyo HPS-SG3 - a great buy!,"This grill is absolutely great! The first two weeks we had it we grilled hamburgers and steaks every other night. It's easy to use and easy to clean (although it is a hand-wash item). Granted, the thermostat control is not the most refined or exact ever, but it really does work well. For many months, I had my eye on another much more expensive electric grill. It was hard to believe a grill this inexpensive could be a quality product and actually work. But I took a chance and it has been a quick, easy to use grill which we use to cook for a family of four. We use it under our existing kitchen stove overhead fan, which complements it perfectly. I happily recommend this grill, and if I needed another one I would not hesitate to order this model. I anticpate doing alot of grilling over the winter, which I could not do as easily outdoors with the gas grill."
5,AWESOME ITEM!,"Sanyo HPS-SG3 200-Square-Inch Electric Indoor Barbeque Grill, BlackThis is an awesome indoor grill! I gave it as a Christmas Gift and we've used it a number of times already and have been very happy with it each time! Definitely a GREAT value!"
2,Good for grill marks and thats about it.,"It took about 10 minutes for this thing to heat up to 325deg F and I'm still not sure it even got that hot. I cooked lamb shoulder blade chops and salmon fillets on here and both took way longer than the instruction book recommended. The lamb came out ok but the salmon fillets dried out because by the time they finished cooking all of the juices had been cooked out of them. Also, the plug in heating element came a little damaged as well so maybe that played a part in this grill not living up to my expectations. I was so excited when this grill came. However, I feel severely let down. It also would have been great if it came with a lid but that's neither here nor there now. I'm returning and buying one a little more expensive and with a lid.P.S. THIS GRILL IS DEFINITELY NOT SMOKELESS. NOT VIRTUALLY, NOT EVEN WITH WATER IN THE DRIP PAN, NOT AT ALL."
5,Nice addition to our kitchen appliances...,Nice addition to our kitchen appliances. The size is perfect for our family of four (but I still use the George Foreman when grilling for just a couple of us.) Sets up and cleans up easily. Seemed to heat up quickly and cooked the food evenly.
4,Very pleased with this one!,"I like grilling for a healthier and tastier way of cooking my food. We live in an apartment, which means no bbq's allowed. We purchased the Le Creuset Oblong Skillet Grill which performed below our expectations. Smoke filled the apartment within 10 minutes of use because of seasonings and juices that had fallen in between the grill slots. This has a drip pan that you fill with water to catches excess juices and as the box says, makes it ""almost smoke-free."" As a former grill cook, I would have to say this is my grilling preference next to a traditional bbq grill."
4,The Grill is great,"The Grill is great, I love it. It heats up really fast and I love the way it cooks the food evenly. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not smokeless. You have to use it in a well ventilated area. All in all it's a great grill. It's a great grill for the price"
4,Good indoor grill,"Easy to use and to clean. Lots of space grilling. For the ones who loves cooking, I recommend this product."
3,SO -SO,"I was somewhat disappointed at the amount of smoke that was made by this so called ""smoke-free"" grill. Also if the pieces are too thick, it will not cook properly. And they could have made the drip pan a lil deeper and less flimsy. However, it is a great device for veggies, shrimp and thin cut fish steaks."
4,Open indoor grill,I really have not used this yet but it is very roomy and I like the fact that with water in the drip pan it should be smokeless. I really like that it comes apart very easy for wash up and should be a breeze to clean. I think if I had used it I might give it an even higer rating but I'm still grilling outside. I like an indoor grill for the winter and if I only have small items.
1,only works for a short time,bought this as a gift for my husband used it about 10 times or less but then it just quit heating in mid use the light was on but no heat so if you want a disposable grill i guess this one is for you!
5,Awesome,I was a bit skeptical but I was just tired of using my barbeque to grill a few small things. This grill is extremely easy to use and clean up. I've made everything from large sirloin steaks to chicken with no problem. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to grill things with ease in their kitchen.
2,a pain to clean,"I was surprised that this appliance had so many high-star reviews because this is a pain to clean! Yes, the grill part is removable but doesn't seem to be immersible. Even if it was, the bottom of the grids have grooves in them, making them very hard to clean. I think you would need a special brush to get this cleansed easily. I am returning mine, maybe I will cough up the extra dough for one that is dishwasher safe."
3,Sanyo grill,"I ordered this grill based on reviews of previous purchasers. I like the grill but the first one I received had a broken handle, not anything that would affect the performance still when I purchase something new I prefer it not be broken in any way shape or form. I returned and ordered a replacement. This was handled in an expedient manner but when my replacement arrived it was broken in the same manner as the first one, must have something to do with the packaging. I kept the grill, bought some super glue and decided to just live with it."
3,"5 star, if not for the price","This product should received a 5 star if not for the price.My 2 dogs only eat Cesar, 4 cans a day.I bough it fm Walmak .67 eachsome time they sell it at .63 @Petmak sell 24can case at $18.99 and now look at the price of this online store !"
1,What a disappointment.,I was so looking forward to it. Then this. The star locating computer simply refuses to be turned on. After hundreds of tries it was on once. Then I turned it off. And then it couldn't be turned on again. What a joke. Don't they have any QC? I have to call tomorrow and hopefully I can exchange one that works. Let see if they have better customer service than QC.
3,Too much,I am not familiar with rain storage and was looking for an intruduction and guide. This book was too detailed for me!
4,Great overview of water storage comcepts,"This book offers an excellent overview of water collection theory. Included are a few detailed build schematics, but this book relies heavily on owner ideas to creat a system dedicated to the individual. I got some great new ideas and can honestly recommend this read."
1,BASIC - Too Basic,"""Specific"" information on a 'few' types of systems. If you're like me and want to build one your next question will be: ""So now what do I do? I guess I better find someone that builds them or buy another book!"" This book did absolutely nothing for me."
2,Water,"Book ok, just hard to get through all the details. Should give general subject matter, and then at the end have a technical section to elaborate further."
3,Lot's of info,"The book has a lot of information but it does leave out some as well. For example it talks about building the cistern in general terms. The author could probably have dedicated at least 2 chapters on that alone. Since most people will be building these projects from scratch and are inexperienced, it's important to talk about not just what works but what didn't work, the failures he's experienced.Good book. Just needs to be about 4 times as thick."
3,Water Storage Tanks,Good book if you uses metric measurments on a daily basis or are familiar with conversion. Neither applies to me but the ideas provided in the book are excellent.
4,Good book,Bought this book for a family member and she loved it. She said it had a lot of really good information in it on water storage.
3,Water storage,I haven't been able to read this book in its entirity as yet but it appears to cover all of the basics.
4,"Water Storage: Tanks, Cisterns, Aquifers, and Ponds for Domestic Supply, Fire and Emergency Use--Includes How to Make Ferrocemen","This book can help you for how to planning the different water systems in rural and urban areas, the best is how to make ferrocement water tanks."
3,"Water Storage: Tanks, Cisterns, Aquifers and Ponds.",Too much social and environmental commentary which I have noticed is common for books on this subject. I just want information on how to best design and build a water collection system. The benefits are obvious to anyone who would buy this book so why use half the book to convince the reader?
2,Not for home use,This book was mainly for large scale water storage and containment. It didn't fit my needs for small scale home use
4,Cheers!,"Have a Christmas cocktail with the Rat Pack! What could be better?Nice album; standard holiday sellections, always a good listen"
2,Lacks Character Development,"This is my first Dale Brown book, so I haven't read enough to make a judgment on the author. However, I found it hard to keep my interest in this book. The character development consisted of little more than their name and call sign. The characters all tend to be petty, and self centered with little variation. The 'no one is better than me' attitude was tiring in the beginning, and the trend stayed through the entire book. It was very much like a soap opera.On a good note, the action scenes were enjoyable, but I found myself not really caring what happenes to the characters in the end. I just wanted to get to the end so I could know what happened, and not completely waste the couple of bucks that I spent on the book. My recomendation if you want to read this book is to check it out at the library."
1,Technodull,"As soon as I saw the recommendation from Clive Cussler I should have known....Dale Brown has written some good stuff but this is awful. Overly technical and the first half reads like a soap opera! No action until way into the second half of the book and while the action is well handled, the characters are on the dull side.I am sure many of you will now enjoy voting that this is an unhelpful review, but this was a painful read at times.Zzzzzzzzzz."
4,Time capsule,"Listening to this is like finding an old reel-to-reel recording made by your parents from a radio show. It's more a historical recording than a ""good listening"" recording, although the restoration is brilliant. If you're interested in hearing (the young) Elvis at his very best get the Sun Sessions CD. If you want to hear Elvis and feel like you're sitting in the waybackradiomachine, get this one. No reason you can't have it both ways...get one of each!"
5,"Of all the Versions of Elvis on the Louisiana Hayride, This is the Best Version Available!!!!","I have listened to all the other versions of Elvis Presley on the Louisiana Hayride, but this version, is definitely the best. You get better sound quality, a more variety of songs/performances, stage talk, etc. So, if you want to hear Elvis on the legendary Louisiana Hayride Radio Show, broadcast live from the historic Shreveport, Louisiana Municipal Auditorium, & the Youth Building, at the Louisiana State Fairgrounds, during the mid 1950's, this is definitely the best option available. By the way there is a statue of Elvie Presley in front of the historic Shreveport Municipal Auditorium. Thanks!!!"
4,Early Elvis,"They played this entire CD on a country music program on our local public radio station, KEXP (where the music matters!) and about halfway through I was clicking on ""One Button Purchase"" for that CD from Amazon. What we have here is a live radio program (well, it was live when they were making this CD!) with a very young Elvis Presley going through his gyrations. You could hear the girls screaming in the background. They even have a couple ""Lucky Strike"" commercials, just to give you a feeling that you are sitting around the radio on a Saturday night in 1954, perhaps in Checotah, Oklahoma, and you are listening to the beginnings of something new - Rock and Roll.Yeah, it's good. Oh yeah - there is at least one song that I thought something bad happened when it went from the CD to iTunes, but no, looks like they had twisted some knob too far when they were recording and they got a little distortion. Oh well. Gotta take a little bad with the good I guess.SeeyaATB"
5,elvis 30#1 hits,"this cd is the best you could possibly get. a must for anyone, even if they'r not an elvis fan. great sound,clear and very good. i give it 5 stars."
2,Whaddaya expect from New Order?,"Steven & Gillian mumble a bit to a reporter.No bombshells.No surprises.Happy I have it, though."
3,Sumner vs. Hook,"Quiet boring but its quiet weird to hear Hook/Sumner without Ian's trembling voice at the back. Joy Division/New Order/Electronic/Other two/Revenge/Monaco fans, get it now!!!!."
3,Interesting. Great writing.,"While preparing for a trip to New Orleans, I came across this book and thought it might give me some interesting background info on the city. The book is a collection of stories and articles written in the late 1800's. Most don't relate to anything that a tourist could currently visit but it does give some interesting insight into the life of the city and Hearn is a fantastic writer.I am a chef and restaurantuer who originally had a deep fascination with Creole cuisine. The section toward the end of the book with recipes was a bonus.Anyone with a more than casual interest in New Orleans, Cajun/Creole, or life in the south back in the late 1800's will find this a worthwhile read."
1,Skating book with Tony Hawk,"Matt Christopher is on the Halfpipe WIIIIITH......no idea what a half pipe is. Matt's a writer, not a skater and it shows. You'd be more satisfied with documentaries or interviews on Tony Hawk if that's what you're interested in. Save your money!-CalebVisit our skate shop online!<a href=""http://www.myboardshop.com"">www.myboardshop.com</a>"
5,Food for heart and mind,"I first heard this album on the car cassette player of a 1980 Ford (imagine the sound quality..), but I was hooked from the first song. The strangely beautiful lyrics give you food for thought, while the music - a mix of reggae basslines, Native American singing and drumming, melodious guitar and Joy Harjo's wonderful saxophone - will haunt you for days. If you have to choose between buying food and buying this album, buy the album. You will forget your empty stomach when you hear it!"
3,kinda good and bad,"blue eyes ultimate dragon you cant get by password,or skull dice,tri-horned dragon,serpert night dragon because they have no pass.this book does not list the booster or what cards you get in the booster but it tells you about the tiers duelists, the password for blue eyes white dragon is 89631139 it works and also dark magician girl has no pass"
2,Not the original recordings,"I love her music but Old Cape Cod and other songs were re-recorded and not as good as the originals. There must be over a dozen greatest hits albums to choose from, so I'd go with another one."
4,Fun History,"This ABC book is a wonderful way to introduce your child to some of the fun and interesting history of Iowa. Readers will discover some little known facts about the state, through real-life pictures and cute illustrations. Mrs. Gensicke really understands what will captivate a young audience and employs her knowledge of the young reader in this book. Audiences of all ages will be surprised at facts they will pick up about a small, but very wonderful state."
3,So so,It does what it is supposed to do to a point. I lost a lot of volume on my headphones and everything sounds much tinnier than without the device. Hard to complain for under $10 though.
1,Gross!,When I was a little girl my Dad and brother watched a lot of B horror movies on TV and this was one of the ones they watched and that movie totally grossed me out with that icky jelly monster thing and I don't think I could ever watch it again without getting spooked and grossed out!
1,SUSPICIOUS TRANSFER TO DVD!,"I completely agree with the other keen reviews concerning the unprofessional transfer of this classic film onto DVD. Mine is not the Criterion copy, although the customer reviews for both products are placed together here, which is ridiculous. The overall quality of the disc and case artwork I purchased is poor and amateurish and I, too, suspect that this is a DVR disc onto which this film was copied. Who is the manufacturer of my DVD and why is it not produced and released by the film's original studio Paramount Pictures? If the film has been considered classic enough to have been added to the Criterion Collection at four times the cost of my cheesy copy, then what could Amazon be thinking by allowing this knock-off item to be included in their inventory, especially after the sharp reviews and comments by so many other customers? I am requesting a refund and will purchase the Criterion DVD, hoping to see an enormous difference in quality."
3,Absorbing Performance,"While Steve McQueen and the other human actors seem to be honing their acting skills, the Blob itself gives an absorbing performance. In addition to the monster's performance, the story is what makes this 1958 production an essential addition to any collection of science fiction movies. Like The Invasion of the Body Snatchers before it, The Blob deals with the idea of dormant alien life drifting through space, just waiting for a chance encounter with an unsuspecting planet. Hey, it could happen. It may have already happened."
1,This IS NOT Criterion! BEWARE!,"This DVD looks as though it was built on someone's local computer. The movie quality is poor. The box artwork is poor. The disk artwork is poor. No extras.The disk itself is a plain writable DVD!! You can tell by looking at the bottom of the disk. (Purple back DVD)I am dissappointed to find that Amazon.com is even selling this and that I was conned into buying it because the other reviews are talking about the Criterion Collection WHICH THIS IS NOT.I typically do not publish reviews, however I am so utterly dissappointed it is shocking....Had this not been purchased for me off of my Wish List, I'd try to find a way to make Amazon take it back....I would have prefered the Criterion Collection..."
1,False Information... Unfair,"This particular copy of the BLOB,(Telefilms International), a great classic movie, is using the same reviews from the Criterion Collection make. I purchased the Telefilms copy and had to returned it because it skipped and stopped in many places through-out the movie. The seller was nice enough to exchange it without even accepting the bad one in return. (I wonder why???!!!)... When I played the replacement it did the same thing in the same places. Now I have to bad movies that skip and stop though-out the movie. I just gave up trying to get a good copy and / or another replacement. I finally purchased my Criterion Collection copy. I am very happy with my new Criterion Collection copy and would avoid the Telefilms International copy. I think it is very unfair that Telefilms International are allowed to use the same reviews of a different film company. Especially a company that has made the effort to put out a GOOD copy. Just a warning. Thanks"
1,Terrible transfer,"The Blob is a classic ""cult"" sci-fi which I so looked forward to owning on DVD. I received the DVD and was so very disappointed to see such poor quality, It was hard watching this blurry, fuzzy, video. I don't know who is responsible for this terrible transfer to DVD, but I suggest you same your money. Worst quality of any DVD I've ever bought."
4,The original classic,"I watched it last night on this DVD and saw the movie for the first time since I saw it in the theater as a kid. It's the original Blob with Steve McQueen, and it was great. I didn't give it a 5 because there is nothing else on the DVD besides the movie. No extras at all. But the quality of audio and visual seemed OK."
3,A Cheesy Classic,"Influenced by the British television series ""The Quatermass Experiment,"" the films ""The Quatermass Xperiment (notice the X),and ""X: The Unknown,"" this film would later be followed by other ""blob"" movies including ""Caltiki, the Immortal Monster,"" ""The Angry Red Planet,"" and ""The Green Slime."" This is the best of them all. Plus it has plently of humor. It is one of the films that is so bad, it's good. Rent it before you buy it."
3,The Blob,We have to consider that this movie was made many years ago and when I watched in TV it was very very scary (but then I was very very young too). Steve McQueen was going upwards to reach stardoom although all caracters in this movie seems so infantile now; I rate this *** just because there wasn't any of the current special effects in those days.
5,a must have for you sci-fi collection,this is one of the best in classic sci-fi.it gets 5 stars from me.oh and the whole family can watch it!
3,Good and Still Kind Of Creepy!,This is a good movie but it is also kind of creepy. I remember watching the Blob a couple of times with my family and being okay and another time I watched it at a friend's house and the movie freaked us out and for the longest time I couldnt watch the movie again but a couple of months ago I watched it again and I liked it and though not as scary as remembered I still found myself getting spooked by the scenes with the blob creature though I really enjoyed watching this movie and seeing Steve McQueen in his first leading roll in a movie and he plays a teenager named Steve and I also enjoyed seeing Aneta Corseaut in the movie playing his girlfriend Jane as the only other roll I ever saw her play was Helen Crump in The Andy Griffith Show and I think this is a good movie and I recommend it!
4,Classic Science-Fiction from the 50s.,"The Blob is classic 50s Science-Fiction with a pretty good performance from a young Steve McQueen. Good special effects for the period and a decent plot that holds interest. Overall, a good classic sci-fi flick."
4,B-grade Sci-fi movies,"A nice, tighly written B-grade Sci-fi movie when a lot of things were still new. There aren't enough good B-grade movies anymore. Too many movie production movies concentrate on either the special effects or a high concept or both. Too often they fail and give B-grade movies a bad name. Today's movie makers and writers should stick to the basic idea: entertainment."
2,Go buy the Criterion collection version The Blob 1958=5 stars out of 5!,"I hate this DVD. There's no menu, yeah I'm serious a DVD with no main menu. I love The Blob 1958 but there was no care put into this DVD release however the film quality is quite good. I don't care about there being no special features but I care about there being no scene selection. I will not be buying the criterion collection dvd any time soon because I buy a dvd mostly for the main feature and this dvd does have a vhs type feel that I like. The DVD gets a 2 stars while the actual film get's 5 stars out of 5.The sequel Beware the Blob 1974 is quite good fun and the 1988 remake is good fun too check them out if you get the chance.DVD:Main feature only"
1,The Blob,"I bought this version:http://www.amazon.com/Blob-Vincent-Barbi/dp/B000AQKU72/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1360518215&sr;=1-1&keywords;=the+blobbecause I love collecting both current and classic sci-fi movies. I got it, and the packaging looked great. However, I put the dvd in and the picture quality is terrible. You can tell it was copied from a VHS version of the movie that was recorded in LP Mode because of the streaking at the bottom of the screen and the horrible audio (back in the 80s and 90, New VHS versions were about $80.00 on their release dates, but you could find $5-$10 versions of the cheaper, LP VHS tapes at Walmart). The dvd has no menu options and stops at certain points in the movie and has to be restarted (I am assuming this is a defective dvd). I am searching for a better quality version and will be returning this one."
4,"""This has never happened before! What'll I wear?!""","The Criterion edition is fabulous looking; the color is crisp and bold (like Pop Art). The Blob has never looked better (it's aged well). I can't say the same for the shucks-gee-whiz-gosh dialog though. And since they waste an inordinate amount of time on these ""teens"" (Steve McQueen was rapidly approaching 30 at the time!), it is a bit tedious to wade through these scenes, anxiously waiting for the good stuff to happen. Thankfully, there's a lot of good stuff to enjoy. I especially love the poor guy, upon hearing the air raid siren, who doesn't know which hat to wear to the emergency.Fun. One of the few horror movies that displays little in the way of horror. (I always spend the bulk of the film worrying about the first victim's little dog.)"
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed, movie is a copy, not original. Thought I was buying and original DVD from the studio. Looks like it was copied from VHS Tape."
5,The Blob,"As a lover of classic sci-fi/horror movies of the 50s and as a connoisseur of same, to me ""The Blob"" ranks right up there with all of the classic sci-fi/horror movies of the 50s. Now the first time that I saw this movie was on the ""Late Show"" way back in 1974, but since it was on TV they took out all of the best parts, but nevertheless it was still worth watching. And now with the advent video cassette recorders (VCRs) and video cassettes I can now watch this classic uncut and unedited-the way it should be-and the way that it should be seen."
3,"Great Movie, Poor Quality DVD","This DVD has a great price, but the quality doesn't compare with the brilliant Criterion release. The picture is soft and the color murky in this print. After having watched this edition numerous times, I was amazed when I watched the Criterion release and saw all sorts of details that simply aren't visible here. This version also is missing a few bits of the film, though not enough to really alter the story.For those just interested in checking out The Blob, this low priced DVD may be fine. If you love the film, by all means spend the extra money and pick up the beautiful Criterion Collection print."
5,"The Blob: 5 stars for the movie, 1 star for Criterion.","First of all, I want to say that 1958's The Blob is a landmark picture and a fantastically fun sci-fi/horror film. Steve McQueen is perfect in it, and it's quite possibly the best sci-fi cheese to come out of the 50s.HOWEVER, I'm fed up with the Criterion Collection. What this company seems to intend to do is snatch up the rights to many, many great movies, ""class"" them up with minimal special features, and sell them at obscene prices. This edition of The Blob has ONE DISC, and the only special features are two commentaries. And we have to cough up $40 to have it.There are no other options; If you want to own this masterpiece, you have to be able to fork up forty dollars to do so.Criterion is trying to target great films that should be enjoyed by everyone to a wealthy group of people."
5,The Blob,If you love classic movies this is a movie to own. Steve McQueen is a young Steve McQueen and he knows his character very well. I am buying these classic movies now before they are gone for good.
3,"pleased, but unpleased","I am very pleased with the quality of the movie, the promptness of the shipper to send it. However, I am very unpleased that the movie did not have the security factory seal, nor the poster it is supposed to have inside the box. I think that for the price paid, the movie shoud bring all what is satded on the back cover."
2,Buy LEAPS at your own risk,I did and lost big time. LEAPS are just as dangerous as any other option. Stay away from options unless you are a professional.
4,Best coverage on Leaps,"This book is written in a very methodical manner with detail coverage of each topic. The book is not one you set down a read in one or two settings but requires careful reading and study. In fact, I have read about 1/3 of the book in depth and proof read the remainder for an overview of its contents. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is I have not applied any of the trade stategies in the book and secondly there are no stock charts in book. Stock charts are an important part of deciding which option trade to apply."
1,The worst See/Dee ever,"Seriously, I'm from the same city this man calls home. I am ashamed that this florida native has migrated north for the duration of his rap career. His music is the worst thing ive heard since the 436 AC/DC album... Seriously...I almost committed sep-i-ku the first time i heard ""Prime Time Players"", a single this man released. hiphop would be better off if every rapper was Cam'ron as opposed to having one Mission(ary) Man in our midst. In order to justify the one star I have to say one thing that is positive...He'll die someday..."
1,Did not like this software,"the software would not load properly onto any of my 3 computers. I have the newest windows 10, windows vista and windows xp. Now I have software that I cannot use"
5,Hysterically Funny and Close to Home,"I got my copy of The Days of Whine and Noses and gave up precious mommy sleep to finish it all into the wee hours of the morning. I laughed, snorted out loud in hysteria and nodded in such sympathetic understanding. Knee deep in my own days of whine and noses,this was a bridge over the Barbie shoes, dirty baby wipes and animal cracker crumbs. Keep it up, Lisa!"
4,NOT BAD AT ALL,"What's up mob fan's? this is james45 and I disagree with Just Another Opinions'review.Hit Man's Journal is a sad story about the not so glamorous life within the rackets ! Danny Aiello is good as always so is his supporting cast,all of them!! from Mark Margolis to Raymond Serra on down.It's sad because Mr.Aiellos' caracter seems to know his time is short due to the road his friend,(William Forsythes' caracter)is travelling, a road vincent surely travelled himself on the way to becoming respected.In the end he's not surprised,he simply moves over for the next up and coming mafioso.sad atmosphere but that's the life."
3,"Not, a good buy if not a huge fan","This, is of course a talking CD, and contains no music. So if you're someone who doesn't already have all the Smashing Pumpkins albums, your money is better invested in that.But, if your wishing to expand your already extensive colloction. It contains interviews from all four members, including information about their childhood, starting the band, and about what has happened to them up to 1995. Not the best topics, but still gives good insight into the band"
3,"Not entirely engaging, but informative","This book describes the life of a merchant (Abu Taqiyya) and some details about his family. You see how he traded, where he traveled, how he negotiated, etc. Also, you see how his family was affected by Abu's merchant lifestyle. It's informative cultural history. But, it's a little slow.The details sometimes get a little too detailed. It's not a sweeping novel, by any means. This was written by a scholar, so expect to see more detail and analyzation than you would in say, a historical fiction novel.The book does its job -- teaching you about merchant culture in 17th century middle east. It's just not a ""fun"" book compared to most."
1,Don't buy this bike,"Notice that all the good reviews are five years old.This bike fell apart gradually during the first two weeks I owned it. i tightend screws and aired up the tires.The final straw was when, after only two week of use, I was two miles from home when the left pedal fell off.The metal threads were stripped and would not screw back on. I consider myself lucky I wasn't injured.Spend a little more and get a bike you can trust."
2,Feels like a cheap product,"Bender was bent. Box was damaged badly when arrived. Did not feel sturdy, or safe, feels like a cheap product. Seriously, better to get a better quality for 10$/20$ more or even the same price. I returned mine and got a much better, sturdier Huffy (almost same price)."
4,Great bike! Watch out for bent rims and dented fenders!,"I love my new bike! After reading the reviews, I was leary about purchasing it. My bike did come with a dented fender and a bent rim. I called Amazon and they made things right with me on this purchase. If you are looking for a cruiser and don't care if it may come with a ding in the fender, I would suggest it!"
3,Good bike fore money,Bike was good. It was a little bent in box.Amazon was unable to ship it by Christmas so it was a few weeks late.They did very little to help me out. Gave me a $10 credit for my trouble.Should have charged them my hourly wage for following up on the order 6 times. Then they would have paid me to take the bike!
2,Poor package and handling,"Love the bike and the look of it, but when it was delivered to the door the shipping box was falling apart and both of the chrome fenders were badly dented, and none of the tools to put it together were there, they probably fell out. If you really like this bike go to a nearby bike store or target and pick it up. very disappointed."
3,The Ghost of Randal Malone,"Randal Malone's character gets axed (yeah, I went there) in the first movie but returns as a ghost to haunt the Lizzie Borden-possessed chick with an axe to grind. Formulative and tired script still manages to entertain due to crisp camerawork and keeping most of the action in and around the stylish setpiece of a house that has appeared in at least ten of Sterling Pictures's movies; the plot is simple, crazy girl (possessed by Lizzie Borden) murders her doc, escapes the nuthouse and goes back to college to lure stupid pretty people to their deaths...standard slasher fare and worth at least one look. Lots of blood and a large dose of ham."
1,I havent received my book yet...almost a month now,I am still waiting for my book...it hasn't arrived...its been a few months since I ordered and still no word.
2,"Great wires and boot, weak connectors","I was impressed by the silicone boots and quality appearance of the wires. Unfortunately, the weak connectors on this wire set weren't strong enough to keep the boots ON the spark plugs. Slide it on a spark plug, click the connector, then, the boot would return back to its normal shape, slipping up and off the spark plug. Same thing happened on the distributor cap end. If they improved the spring strength of the connectors these would be a great wire set."
4,Cool LP/Cool Label,"This would be great on vinyl, but I never saw it. Afro Art is a great label and this is a cool compilation with a great variety of electronic sounds - fantastic artwork too."
2,"Boring, couldn't finish","I'm a big fan of most of the books by Terry Brooks, however the First King was the first book of his I couldn't bring myself to finish. I read the original Shannara years ago and now going back and rereading all of them.Overall the book was very slow and boring. Found myself skipping many pages at a time till I finally just gave up on it. Either I've mistaken with how good the original Trilogy was (since it was about 10 years ago when I read them) or this book is a far cry from the originals."
4,A great prequel,Length:: 1:21 MinsA wonderful prequel to a great series. Gives a lot of background info and character play
4,Refreshingly intense fantasy novel,"This is the first Shannara novel I have read in about 14 years. In that time I was surprised to see how graphic and violent the novel was. Most fantasy books I have read simply gloss over the fact that people die. Brooks makes sure you know that there was a loss and you feel it more. Another refreshing change was one of the main characters dies. I did not want to see the character pass, but it was nice to see that sometimes heroes fail. After being halfway through this book, I started looking at the Shannara series to see which ""Trilogy"" I should read next and I found out that this book contains a spoiler in reference to the Heritage of Shannnara series. Oops. I guess I will have to just act surprised. All in all I would recommend this book to any fan of fantasy, It was truly enjoyable."
4,the warlock lord is trying to be kept from taking over.,I think that this book is a good mixture of tolkien's books and classic fantasy. brooks writes well enough that you feel like you are there living it with the characters. Bremen is an awesome character to put in this book and you will find yourself rooting for him and kinson the whole time. this is the first book by brooks that i have read. it ranks right up there with robert jordan and j.r.r. tolkien in by book.
3,First King is good - but not his best,"Terry Brooks is a masterful writer, that cannot be denied. His previous work, especially in this series, is outstanding. However, this book never seemed to hook me the way the others did. It is a solid tale, but holds few surprises and as a prelude to the others in the series, it's ending is essentailly known to all but first time readers. While the story was a bit of a rehash of old material with a few extra details, Brooks does a fairly good job of keeping it interesting. I recommend this book, but I would also advise you read his others as well as they are of better quality."
4,'professional' critic?,"I echo the positive reader reviews that follow this one. The only thing that puzzles me is why the bone head who wrote the professional review at the top of this page can't understand what a prequel is. The story takes place PRIOR to The Sword of Shannara not years after and explains much of what is talked about in 'Sword' - Brona, Bremen, the failure of Jerle Shannara. Anyone who had read 'Sword' would have recognized this fact, even without prequel written all over the book, which makes me wonder if the reviewer has even read a Brooks book. Anyway, this book foreshadows a darkening of Brooks' writing that emerges fully in the 'Voyage' series. Great book."
5,"I've never read a better book , I've only read equals .","This is even better than LORD OF THE RINGS .I finished it in a night and a day !Here is the plot :Bremen , an outcast of the Druids , has discovered that Brona , the Warlock Lord , has gathered a force to attack the Four Lands .He warns Athabasca ,the High Druid of Paranor of this danger ,but he doesn't believe him .Bremen ,knowing that Paranor will be lost , goes to the Hadeshorn to find out how Brona may be destroyed . He is provided with two visions :an elf , with a gleaming sword , and a vision of the Black Elfstone .So he sends Tay Trefenwyd ,an elf after the Black Elfstone ,and his dwarf friend Risca to the Dwarves , for they are surely going to be attacked next,and they must know it , and Bremen himself searches for a way to forge the sword ."
1,Getting worse by the minute,"This tiresome, overrated series seems to grow worse with each new book, ""expanding"" on the horribly shallow mythos that is the world of Shannara. This novel represents the depths of the series that should never have moved past the very first book, The Sword Of Shanarra, and would best be avoided by any who don't wish to drag themselves through hundreds of pages of bland narration and thin dialouge."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I like Terry Brooks. I've read Wishsong and the Heritage books. I really didn't like this book. It was super boring. It was kind of neat to read about the fall of the druids and Bremen. But the story was terribly predictable. Originality was scarce. It felt like I had read the story before in a much better form. If you haven't read Terry Brooks before, read Wishsong. If you have, don't bother with this."
1,Just as boring as someone said......,"The entire story is very boring. No enthrill. No depth.And most of all, you could easily expect what will happen next.What can be more boring than this?"
5,This book is bound to keep you interested!,"I generally didn't think I would like these books, but as soon as I started reading I became hooked. Once I started I couldn't stop. It took me about 3-4 days to finish this book, and when it ended I knew I couldn't stop there...I knew I had to read onward, and quickly went to the libaray and found the next. I hope you try to read this and find it as interesting as I did."
5,Fantastic fantasy,"I read the original trilogy at 15. At 30, I have rediscovered Brooks. The First King was exciting. I couldn't put it down. A very enjoyable pace, great plot. I loved it so much that I read First King and the three in the Heritage of Shannara series all in the same month. I couldn't get enough. Now I am reading the Sword over again which is slow in comparison. My only wish is that Brooks would write more in this series. He is a literary artist. His style of writing is as interesting as the stories."
5,Great book read this review!!!!!!!,"In this fabulous book, one of Brooks best, the outcast druid, Bremen learns that the rebel druid Brona, the worlock lord,is building an army to destroy the druids. Bremen then tries to the tell the rest of the druids but they send him out. But a few believe him and decide to go with him. The group then goes to the hadeshorne, aplace where the dead rest, to talk with the dead. The dead give bremen 4 visions. Bremen alone goes back to the druid keep only to find them all dead. Now he and the rest are left to warn the rest of the world and prepare them for what lies ahead. Bremen then goes to work to find the soon-to-be maker of the talisman which will destroy Brona."
4,"Outstanding, this story rivits you to read on!","Terry Brooks does it again with the prelude saga of the Shannara origin. This book answers all of those interesting questions raised in the other Shannara trilogy. Where Bremen came from, the origin of the Sword of Shannara, the Black elfstone, and other interesting origins of other characters. Many exciting battles are fought between orc, trolls, gnomes, elves, and dwarves. Along with use of blue druids fire and evil Warlock black magic. Read it today!"
5,The First King of Shannara,"The Warlock Lord (an ex druid by the name of Brona) is trying to take over the Four Lands. The druids will not acknowledge that. It is left to Bremen, Kinson, Mareth, Risca, and Tay to defeat a creature who calls up monsters from the netherworld to do his bidding and his army.After the druids are defeated, the five people separate. Risca goes to fight with the dwarves in their fight with the Warlock Lord. Tay goes to ask the elves to help the dwarves and mount a search for the black elfstone. Bremen, Kinson, and Mareth search for a master smith who will help create a sword that appears to be able to defeat the Brona, and the man to wield it.Can they save the Four Lands, or will the races be destroyed?The Four Lands is a huge place. It has elves, dwarves, and other creatures from the time of faerie, however, it also has trolls, gnomes, swamps, and other dangers not worth saying. It is a wonderful place filled with many dangers."
5,A great addition to a great series,"Yes, it's a prequel, and if you're just starting on Brooks' series then by all means, read it first. I'm reading them all for a third time - and I don't read ANY fantasy or science fiction novels. That's how good the Shannara series is.I really admire the way Brooks has reached back and tied the characters together once again, allowing us to see the long ago history of the characters we've followed through this series. It's quite entertaining for a fan of the series to see the familiar names cropping up, and being able to see how these families were entwined in one another's fates from generations earlier than the first installment."
4,I loved it!,"I can almost forgive the travesty that was ""Talismans of Shannara"" after this book. Brooks broke away from the old formula and gave us one more exciting story in this mostly entertaining series."
3,Mediocrity at it's best,"The writing reminds me of that of a college student brainstorming the night before a paper is due. There is potential but Brooks seems to have a cheap and fast cop-out arranged for each intense part. It's as if he's constantly 10 minutes away from his deadline. Instead of constructing ingenious escapes and daring attacks, Bremen too often comes forward and says he just devised a new magic. Sure it's dangerous and he will be weak for the rest of his life but it just might work. And of course it works. Suddenly, 20 pages later, the characters are in a jam and, lo and behold, Bremen constructs a new magic more dangerous than the one before. But it just might work....."
3,First and last to read,"I'll focus on why I rated this book a 3, without using a spoiler.-1 The idea of a dark power, never resting, gathering an army, to destroy all races... Hello, how many books copycat Tolkien's?-1 Predictability of the plot. The enemy will live on, people who are single will die, people who are in love will live, the book ends pretty much as it starts, i.e. expect a sequel with similar plot.+1 The characters are deep, I always love that in a book. There's more than one main character and each one is well depicted.+1 The language used, particularly for describing surroundings is amazing. One rarely stops to reread an enviroment description in a book, as in this one."
5,Great fantasy action. A must-read for Brooks' fans,"I've been a fantasy fan since threee years now. I guess my favorite authors are Tolkien and Brooks. ""The First King of Shannara"" is one of the best books I have ever read. I recommend that you read first all of the Shannara saga first because of some details (for example: the one who forged the sword, the true story about Allanon, etc) that are better appreciated by the ones familiar to the story of the Four Lands. Overall, it's a great title (perhaps the best in the Shannara line)."
2,Not all to waste,"This is the first book - in well over 500 read - that I have ever left unfinished. Terrible, from start to half-finish. Skip this.(it got two stars because the cover was nice, and I'm not mean enough to give just one)"
2,Brooks needs to get a life,"Terry Brooks hopped on the Tolkein fantasy badwagon in the seventies, one of the first truly copycat writers to do so. Since then, fantasy authors like Jordan and Silverberg, Feist and Bradley, have largely succeeded in exploring new realms and systems, new races and generally developing new ideas--all except Brooks. He struck gold with the first book and has been milking that vein ever since.As an author Brooks in not utterly without talent, though that talent is still largely undeveloped after all these years. The world of Shannara didn't have the depth of Tolkein's to begin with, and has long since run dry. Mr. Brooks should either get off the teat and write something new, or he should retire this series and live off the royalties."
3,Back To The Classic Style,"Like many young readers of my generation, I grew up with The Sword of Shannara. The easy to read text, the episodic adventures reminiscent of Alexander Dumas, and the thrilling Brothers Hilderbrandt illustrations made this book a juvinile classic. However, I never liked the two immdeiate sequels [Elfstones; Wishsong]. Their major problems were uninteresting premises and lots of intangible magic. The ""Heritage"" series gradually restored the feel of the original book, introducing fun influences from the Oz series. But First King is the only Shannara book as good as the original. Although Brooks [like Baum] can be deadly dull, First King has the same brisk air of high, childish adventure. The characters are broad [described in a few lines - in the manner of a good Jr. High-School book report], the battles big and exciting, the conclusion satisfying. I hope that Brooks indulges in a few more ""prequels""."
5,A TRULY SPLENDID BOOK. HOURS OF ENJOYMENT.,"The First King of Shannara is the eighth installment inMr. Brooks' magnificent Shannara series, yet it is actuallya prequel to the series. In this book, many of the thingsalluded to in the in the preceding books are revealed indetail: the fall of Paranor and the Druids, the forging ofthe Sword of Shannara, the discovery of the Black Elfstone,the origin of Allanon, and more. Whether or not you haveread the other Shannara books, this book is still extremelythrilling. I cannot recommend this book enough."
2,Didn't get cover art on my Kindle,I'm very disappointed the publisher did not include the cover image for this ebook. It dampened my expeience as it felt like I got a damaged incomplete product for the price of a new book.
4,something about this book,"This book explains a lot which is hidden in previous novels of Shannara saga. But it's not clear why author has chosen the only person as a keeper of druid legacy (Bremen is followed by Alannon, then by Walker) Another feature which spoils Shannara's books a little is the fact that women images are very similar to each other. There is always the same type: the boyish girl. Though the heroines with tragic destiny (see ""The Elfstone of Shannara"" and ""The Druid of Shannara"") are exclusion. Well, the author has described gorgeus landscapes full of incredible creatures and magic. The most magic scene, I suppose, is the birth of Sword. Despite my remarks it would be a good idea to make a film."
5,The story is mesmerizing!! Another masterpiece by Brooks!!,"I found the book captivating... but I always do when I read a book by Terry Brooks! I've read the entire ""Shannara Saga""... three times!! I always did want to know how it all started. I just hope it doesn't end! Terry once again writes with a skill that let's you experience the story as if you were right there traveling and fighting along with the characters. Absolutely thrilling!! ""The Elfstones of Shannara"" was the first Science Fiction book I ever read, and I have been hooked ever since! Thanks again,Terry, for another great novel! I'm looking forward to the next one!"
3,"Long, too long","The book is too long for the storyit brings, so I think.And the story is not all that good, but if you like big series, this is one to take a look at."
3,First King of Shannara,"This is the first book in a trilogy and I have only read half of it. So far, I am happy to continue the journey through the other books. I find the characters interesting and the their ultimate goal to destroy evil worthwhile.As a criticism, I feel like the adventures (so far) have all been written into a shopping list and the actors are running through them in order, checking them off one at a time. The fact that their actions have all been fortold by the 'dead' is not leaving me any doubt as the reader that they are going to accomplish their goal of destroying evil. Good heroes need good villian(s) who have just as much chance of implementing the evil plan as the heroes have of thwarting it.There is still time to suprise me so I still have high hopes for the other books. I know that I am a critical type person so don't under rate my 3 stars. It means that I would recommend the book to others to read."
2,Terry Brooks is losing his Shannara touch,"All i have to say is WOW! This book was a huge disappointment. It's been quite sometime since i've read other installments in the series, and i am trying not to let this one keep me from reading the others again. It was unimaginative, rehashed, cliche fantasy material, enough said. It seems for fans of the series that no matter how generic, it suffices. Which is ridiculous. It could be the fact that i just finished Tolkien's works, but even so, i found it dull and waited patiently for the last page hoping Brooks would redeem himself. The characters are boring and all the same. Except for difference of career, none of the many characters in the novel have distinguishable personality traits. Simply put, a big snooze, a waste of 400 some odd pages of reading. The only benefit i got from it was knowing what NOT to do in my own writing undertakings."
3,"Fairly Standard Fantasy, but an enjoyable read - Really 3.5","Terry Brooks burst onto the fantasy scene with his fantastic epic, The Sword of Shannara. First King of Shannara is the prequel of Sword of Shannara, and faces the problem of many prequels: you know what is going to happen.Despite this handicap, Brooks weaves an interesting story, creating a believable cast of characters. But, this book may be better appreciated by readers who read this book prior to reading Sword.Character development exists, but it seems that the rich writing that made Sword such a major fantasy event is lacking in King. A lot of time is spent setting up events for the future story to be found in Sword. Naturally, this is the purpose of any preguel, but it does cast a shadow over the storytelling aspects of this book.First King of Shannara is a good book, but does not qualify for greatness. It should be enjoyed by all fans of Brooks' Shannara series."
3,Good and not-so-good,"In many ways this book is well-written, don't get me wrong, but I had a few problems with it. First, Brooks shows that he knows nothing about the Druids - He really shows his ignorance here. I would expect an author to put just a little effort in research. Second, the characters are just a little flat. Third, I had a hard time focusing in on a main hero. At first I thought it was Bremen, then he would disappear for several chapters. But this book did have some very well-written scenes. It could have been better.(and please Mr. Brooks, do some research on the Druids! )"
3,"Straight-forward, Simple, Predictable","What more to say ? Although I am a fan of Terry Brooks, especially the original trilogy and some of his other books, the ""First King"" brings nothing new to the table, in a predictable, simple fantasy story the precludes the Sword. What happened to creativity in developing and writing a story ?"
3,It's Okay,"It's okay. Has short verses and nice illustrations. It really isn't something that I wanted though. I wanted a traditional book that had Psalms in them or something.Anyway, it's hardcover, arrived within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping. Arrived brand new and nothing was damaged during shipping. I bought this directly from Amazon."
4,Easy To Assemble And Blends In Nicely,"This shelving unit was one of the easiest that I've ever assembled, and I've assembled plenty of them since I have to house over four hundred CDs and nearly two hundred DVDs. I have owned everything from cheap units to rather expensive and complicated to build units. I put this one together in under ten minutes and the only hang-up was spacing the DVD shelves properly. I remedied this quickly after I placed my first shelf in by taking a DVD and placing it on the shelf, then putting the next spacer in place.Like another reviewer stated, this unit is somewhat flimsy, but it comes with a stationary strap that you can attach to the wall if you so choose. Personally, I think that once you have the unit assembled and the bulk of your media on the shelves, this unit will stay put unless you get a little rough with it.Overall, not a bad unit for your media. It has a nice look to it and it blends into the background rather well."
1,doesn't match the picture,"I returned this shelf unit because it is a shiny silver stand. It appears much darker in the picture. Also, it is a very tall and narrow stand that would fall over easily if placed on carpet."
4,Good DVD rack,"Easy to assemble. Seems a little unstable, but it should stand up without a problem as long as you don't walk into it."
4,Solid,Solid DVD tower. no real complaints. dont expect anything special but certainly does the job. reliable quality
3,6tier translunce adjestable multimedia shelving,"it's very good , product and i'll have to buy another one , i all ready have others , so i will buy more . They are strong and well made ,that's way i buy them."
1,"Crappy product, plain and simple","I wish I could give this form 0 stars. It's just plain junk. It wobbles, you can barely get a pin through it and it gaps when you turn the dials to make it larger. It also falls down at times. I've had my form for a while now and the only reason I haven't thrown it out is because it holds my jacket and scarf and looks cute from the window. BUT, if you want something you can really use for other than window dressing, I'd say pass this form by. And for over $100 are you kidding me? That's just plain silly. From the looks and feel of this thing, I'd say it cost a 10th of that to make it."
2,Wrong size indicated on box. Not a 10-16 as indicated.,"If you're an American Size 4, order this dress form in Size 10-16 as indicated by its description and on the box itself. Had to return this item twice because the dress form was no where near a size 10 even with all the dials completely maxed out. I'd say it about a size 8 at best. I did give it at least two stars because the quality of the product itself (aside from sizing) is pretty good. Nice upholstered body form which takes pinning very well. Too bad the sizes don't match up."
1,dress form singer,"piece of junk I sew every day and the dress form does not stay up! it constantly falls down when you adjust the height. do not buy F--- maybe if they made the pole with some kind of grip but nooo they make it slippery metal.HIGHLY disapointed.If you are sewer you will not like this in fact, I feel like throwing it in the garbage!!!!what a waist of money very cheaply made junk also the inches on the dials are not understandable."
3,Meh.,"Eh... It's okay. Now that I have it, I wish I would have just saved up and bought a professional one. I guess it's good if you arent serious about sewing or anything but all it feels like is a cheap plastic mold covered in foam and fabric on top of a broom stick that was stuck into a Christmas tree stand. It's wobbly, twists a lot, and there isnt much to pin to... I guess I had higher expectations for the price. It's not completely terrible... But I dont know if it'll work for all my projects (Costumes, everyday wear, formal attire, refitting...)."
5,PAYOFF,"SOMETIME WE GAIN A FEW POUNDS,AND BUY NEW CLOTHES, THIS MANIKIN WILL SAVE YOU MONEY, IT WILL STRETCH YOUR CLOTHES IN THE AREAS YOU NEED A FEW INCHES, IT`S NOT ONLY GOOD FOR SEWING PURPOSES GOOD BUY ."
3,It's ok...,This dress form is not sturdy and made of plastic. If you use it as a hobby it's OK but for everyday sewing it would be better to buy a professional one. The hemline attachment is nice and the felt cover could be better.Again it's OK for a few projects and if you have patience to deal with a flimsy dress form.I was very mad once I took it off the box... now I accepted her :)
4,pretty good,"pretty good, kinda expensive for what it is though. just plastic with some felt over it..."
3,Large mannequin vs small mannequin,"I bought a smaller and larger one. The smaller one-dubbed Lovey Dovey-is gray and I purchased brand new. It appears to be symmetrically assembled. The larger one-Fanny- was bought as used. All parts were in the box, including the instruction owners manual. But I think I can figure out why it must have been previously purchased then returned. The hips don't exactly match. I will not be returning it though as I am a recreational sewer and I think I can make do with it. Price wise this was the best way to purchase these tools as in the stores they cost no less than double the amount. Having these ""ladies"" makes me look forward to my projects."
3,adequate,"This dress form does the job, but is flimsy (for being over $100) and wobbly. I am satisfied, but wish it was a more stable and sturdy model. The nice thing is it is lightweight and easy to move, but the downside is that it is all plastic, and easily warped during shipping. The felt-topped outside is, again, just adequate for pinning.The hemline attachment is useful.All in all, though, this was the best price for an adjustible dress form."
4,Great dress form for the money,I had read some negative reviews about this brand of dress form and was hesitant to buy one. I did buy one and found the only thing I found that is poorly constructed is the base which is made of plastic instead of metal. This is not a problem with me as I do not expect strong winds to be passing through my house any time soon. Since having this form I have found it to be of great value. I am sewing clothing for my daughter who lives out of state and they are fitting her beautifully. No more guessing at sizing.
4,Does the job!,Bought this for me wife. She loves it! It gets the job done and it's easy enough to move out of the way when necessary.
3,FLIMSY,This product is VERY flimsy! It wobbles around easily and the body is very light. The part that attaches to the pole and helps to measure the bottom of skirts/dresses/etc. broke off immediately. Please consider buying something of better quality. This is a reminder to me why cheaper is not always the best way to go.
5,There's only one Albert Ammonds; all the rest are copycats,There's only one Albert Ammonds; all the rest are copycat
4,Great vintage racing footage.,"Being a Jag owner and enthusiast, I thought I'd give this video a try. It does portray a lot of good, never before seen at least by me, racing footage from different race tracks and Le Mans during the golden years of sports car racing featuring not just Jaguars, but many other marques also. Found it to be quite entertaining and recommend it to anyone interested in vintage racing history."
3,That's what saudade is all about,"Saudade meaning longing in Portuguese,it must have invaded Caetano while creating this album.He was about to return to Brazil from exile when he embarked in this project.Eventually a cult disc and not a commercially succesful LP,TRANSA(making love)has its ups and downs.The English language tracks are a mixed bag while the Portuguese language songs are definite hits.Mora na Filosofia is my favorite.Not the best work of Veloso,but not the worst either."
2,"An ""invidious"" book to read","This tome (scholarly book) may have a great purport (purpose), but the message is hidden in the sempiternity (endless amount)of $5 words. In fact, after reading this book, I feel like I've mastered a study in Roget.It seems obvious to me the authors had their thesauraus wide open while writing this book, and only for the purpose of impressing us with their vast command of the English language. The author also continually speaks in parantheses (meaning, he slices a sentence in two, therefore distracting the reader from the original intent). Sarcasm intended.In summary, find a book that is readable. This one isn't."
4,Brilliant book but ...,"This book contains a wealth of information on EA. However it is based on an older version of TOGAF. But one is able to relate the information to more recent version of TOGAF, so I can still recommend this book for anyone who wants to go more in depth on TOGAF."
4,Good Book,A must for anyone that works on there cars. Good price and very detailed information about all the repairers you want to do.
1,Not very helpful as a trouble shooting manual,"I recently ordered this book to help me troubleshoot an electrical problem with my 1997 Grand Prix. I am quitedisappointed with the quality of this book. It is printed on newprint paper (very low quality), and feels quite flimsy.More importantly, since this book covers such a wide range of GM ""W cars"", it contains very little specific information tohelp me with my problem. All in all I found this to be a waste of money."
5,Discovery of Love,"Kathryn Chilcote's first book is a short endeavor, but packed with emotion and fascinating insights into the life and love of someone devoted to opera. The story moves quickly, but creates vivid pictures. The reflection of deep love strikes home to all.Chilcote's choice of words is colorful, meaningful, and to the point.Recommended way to read: Put on a good recording of ADA, pour yourself a glass of red Italian wine, and prepare for a moving experience."
4,great music,I won this cd in a sweepstakes. I had never heard of David Frizzell. I listened to the whole cd and I loved most every song on the cd. That is rare. I suggest this cd to all country music lovers and everyone else.
3,Very complete and professional,Harder than I thought it would be making bread. Techniques are explained but they are too professional as the writter is. I gave up trying most of them...
5,wonderful resource,"I am loving this bread baking book! Although I have been baking for years, I have never had such instruction in texture, temperature, technique, and feel as I have in this book. I have tried the pizza, bagels, and sandwich bread from this book, and have been very satisfied and successful with each of them. This is a great addition to my library!"
5,Great Starter Book,"My New Years resolution was to learn to bake artisan breads at home. I looked over many books on line and chose this one. I am very pleased. The author provides great background on the bread making process so you understand the importance of the detailed steps he provides. I started with Baguettes and they were a hit with my toughest critic - great aroma, appearance, taste and bite. I am eager to try the many other types of artisan breads in the book."
5,Wonderful!,"I love bread, always have, it's been an ""obsession"" of mine and therefore I simply HAD to have this book due to the reviews and recommendations.The recipe I mostly use from the book is the pizza dough and the cinnamon bun recipe, though all of them look great, easy and the science behind the bread is just so interesting. I highly recommend the book for anyone intersting in making good bread, recently I also purchased a baking stone, and so i'm eager to try more recipes, using a mixer makes things very easy, the dough always comes out perfect.I love this book so much, I even left some clothes behind just to be able to carry it back with me when I was on travel."
3,Actual Breads just ok,"It would be nice if there were some points on what to do next time if your bread doesn't turn out as planned. All of my breads turned out much heavier than illustrated in diagrams. My Italian & Ciabatta breads were better but nothing like shown in the pictures (Those use 100% bread flour). The Ciabatta bread did not require a window pane test so I was hoping that would come out better, in case I wasn't really passing it, even though I thought I was.The Lavash Crackers show different shades and textures. Mind came kind of the same except were the thinner parts were somewhat over done. In general it was too thick, bread like. I thought I rolled it out to more than 15"" x 12"" he called for but adjusted for the fact I held back more than half to try to make a pita, not sure what he mean't by ""paper thin"".It is inspirational, if only my breads actually turned out better. I have cooked for awhile, but this is my first attempt at bread."
5,A great book on bread baking.,This was just the book I needed. It gave the philosophy of bread baking and helpful tips on improving the product. It is not just a book of recipes.
5,Wonderful book,"This book is both clear and well-written, and its pictures are very useful. If you're just getting into breadbaking like I am, this book is a MUST!The author addresses the process from beginning to end, and each of the concepts are explained in a way that is easy to understand. There are personal anecdotes that help to drive the lessons home, and I never feel as if the author is underestimating my intelligence even though the information is so accessible. Overall, a worthwhile purchase."
5,My father has made great bread with this book,"Well I usually do pros and cons for video games so I'll do that for this tooPros:*Many great bread ideas*Takes you though step-by-step*Teaches you the basics and the more advanced*The end result is great bread(Trust me on that one)*Teacher you how to make sweets, healthy bread, the basic delicious bread and more*A great book for the beginers, and more advancedCons:I can't think of any..."
5,Simply Awesome!,"I bought this book due to comments made by members at TheFreshLoaf.com. It was recommended as the first book you should buy if you want to learn how to bake your own bread. I was a little worried the recipes may need exotic ingredients (due to a review I read somewhere), but was happy to find this not to be the case. I live in Australia and have had no trouble finding any of the ingredients (although there are a couple of recipes I am yet to attempt, whith ingredients I haven't looked for yet). I have made several of the breads in this book, with great success in every attempt! My families favorite thus far is the Vienna, and I'v just baked a fantastic Sourdough Ciabatta. As a bread baking beginner, I cannot recommend this book highly enough!.......nor would I hesitate in buying any book written by Peter Reinhart!......& it's only $20!........Simply Awsome!"
5,wonderful baking book,Another great book by Peter Reinhart. I purchased all his books. Love his writing style. Instructions is very clear and pictures throughout the book. There is alot of wonderful recipes to try out.
2,Disappointed,"This book is excellently made, beautiful images, very detailed instructions, exact formulas (or not?).I bake my bread because I want perfect bread, and after following Mr Reinhard guidelines my breads are still a long, long way from the breads pictured in the book, breads come out correctly but don't even get near the breads pictured despited the huge efforts I've been doing. I follow some of the formulas and I see in the picture how they hold a beatiful dough while my dough slips between my fingers, his doughs raise beautifully while mine get thick and dense (tasty anyway).I don't understand how I'm the only one to rate so low this book but I assure you that before reading the book using fresh yeast and tweaking the recipies more or less by intuition I got better results. The use of this book, up to the moment has been very frustating to me.Despite the extensively detailed explanations I guess Mr Reinhard keeps a lot of secrets for himself."
2,Not for the beginner,I found this book to be overwhelming. There are only a few recipes that take less than 48 hours to prepare. I appreciate the quality of the final product but this book is not for the apprentice it is for the seasoned professional.
2,bread baker.s apprentice,This book is not for the amateur! I also is capable of causing divorce and obesity. Cleaning up after this mess whilr put astrain on you marriage. It mostly requires a lot of counter space and a huge refrigerator.
2,Not Great,"I'm not a novice baker, yet certainly not a professional but I found these recipes to be complicated and time consuming. Baking good bread should be time consuming, but not to this level. Perhaps someone who is going to school or already a professional would enjoy this, but not me. There are many better books out there and I found it very strange that this guy uses shortening instead of butter, which changes the taste. I'm glad I checked it out at the library instead of wasting my money."
5,"The most authentic Italian Bread not made in Italy-- Jackson, MS","This book is incredible. Reinhart really breaks down the process of making a great loaf of bread in a very reader-friendly way. He explains everything on why you use certain types of grain, what will happen in different situations, why you have to use steam, how to shape the loaves, etc etc. My first bread-making experience was w/ the recipe for Italian Bread, and it came out almost exactly like the bread I had while studying abroad in Siena, IT. Now I'm trying my hand at the French bread recipe, and the fermenting dough is in the fridge as I type."
5,I love this book. It is astonishing.,"I have baked from this book for four years and I love it no less than the day I got it, amazed and intrigued, as a spontaneous gift from a family member. It remains one of the most life-altering gifts I've ever received. Reinhart brought out the bread nerd in me, and I have spent countless hours honing my bagel boiling and my baguette shaping. If you are looking for a comprehensive introduction to artisan bread baking for a beginner, or if you have baked bread and want to know more about the science of baking and the lore of varietals from several (western) cultures, this book is unparalleled."
5,Beautiful Book,"I just received this book. All simple recipes using only flour, water and yeast. Sooooo many variations. Try the lavash-yumm!"
4,I like it,Has a good inforamtion about the bread and the different kinds of bread that can be prepare with it. Nice
5,A great beginning,This book was perfect for my daughter who is just beginning to understand and and make bread. We were very satisified.
4,Wonderful book,"Lot's of great info, especially for those wanting to learn the basics. Terrific recipes,some very easy, and some a bit more complicated. I would have given this a 5 rating, however, I found a bit too many recipes requiring pre-ferments. Just too much work for many. I think that more recipes without having to spend 2-3 days preparing would have been helpful."
5,great learning tool,"I kept borrowing this book from the library, so I decided I really needed a copy of my own in fairness to other patrons! This book tells HOW bread works so that the reader can become independent and creative. If you want more than just recipes, you've got to read this book! You'll be given the knowlege to create a style and methods of your own. A must read for anyone wanting to master the art of bread baking."
5,The best bread you will eat outside of Paris,I bought this book for my fiancÃ© along with a digital scale and now the house is filled with the smell of baking bread (and the sink full of bowls and dishes and wild yeast growing into sourdough starters). This book teaches the science and art behind the bread making and now his loaves from other bread recipes are even better. The pain l'ancienne and the Kaiser rolls are amazing! Perfect for learning to make a wide range of breads and also practical advice about what gadgets you need or don't need.
2,The bread baker's apprentice-mastering the art of extraodinary bread by peter reinhart,"Hi,I bought this book a long time a go and I am waiting and waiting and I never see the book. This book already paid. I just wonder how long you have to hold this book.And I want to know when are you going to send me the book. This book, I bought on October 1st, 2011. You see how long that I've been waiting for it.The title of this book: The Bread Baker's Apprentice - Mastering The Art of Extraodinary Bread By Peter Reinhart.Thank you"
3,Printed in China cost it 2 stars,"As a book, it is fabulous. The recipies hold plenty of promise for a bread baker's apprentice. There are illustrations, bakers' percentages, explanations... that earns it 5 stars.Then, it comes the country of origin. The book was printed in China.Don't they print books in the United States anymore, or what?I was going to give it 5 stars, until I saw the ""printed in China"" label. That is -2 stars, because book as informative and beautiful as this one, it just deserves to be printed at home."
3,Good book,"This is a beautiful book and addresses the science of bread making and the chemical processes that occur during it in an in-depth fashion. The question then becomes, why don't I use this book more? I bake bread weekly and, although I have made several of the recipes in this book, I usually find myself turning to other books, where the recipes are clearer and quicker.Most of the recipes in this book require 2 days to make. The selections are beautiful and tasty, but seem more like breads for special occassions, rather than the everyday fare I'm usually looking for. If you're thinking about getting into the business of breadmaking, I'd certainly recommend buying this book. If, however, you just bake for your family, I think you can find more affordable books that will give you extremely good recipes.Check out ""The Garden Way Bread book"" if you want a more eclectic book with very tasty recipes."
4,Good but you need time plus ingredients,"This is a great book. I had tried some recipes off the web, but this book really gives a good, broad look at various forms of bread. Besides having all the right ingredients, you need to plan ahead for several of the recipes. And I don't mean hours, I mean days. Many of the recipes like challah and bagels take 2 days. Plan accordingly.Overall, everything I have made from this cookbook is fantastic. Great cornbread, tasty challah, and solid white bread. This cookbook is definitely a keeper."
4,one of the best bread books,"being in culinary and pastry school i have heard time and time again how great this book is. i received it as a gift, but it didn't disappoint, it's a great book and i highly recommend it if you enjoy baking bread. has charts and info"
4,Good New Information,"This book gives a lot of tips and tricks that allow you to make loaves of bread that don't appear homemade. However some of the recipes, such as the pizza dough, are a little overcomplicated without a lot of reward. I've tried many of the recipes but found I can get great results (and many times better tasting bread) by using the knowledge from this book, with recipes from other books. Another thing I found was that the measurements for water in most recipes seemed too low and I've had to make slight adjustments."
5,Bread Bakers Apprentice:,This is the best bread making book I have EVER purchased. I make a lot of bread and the recipes I have tried so far (5) all have tasted as good as the artisan breads sold at the bakery. Crusty bread is a real must for me.Most take two days to make but well worth the time and effort.
4,one of my favorite bread books,"Appropriate for novice and advanced bakers alike, this book is full of excellent recipies and clear explanations of fundamental techniques.I was not impressed with Reinhardt's recipe for Panettone, but the Stollen recipe turned out very well as did most of the hearth-style breads.Definitely a worthwhile investment."
5,THE BREAD BAKERS BIBLE,"I am overwhelmed by this book. It's every bread entusiasts must have book.Peter Reinhart shares every ounce of knowledge he has encompassed over his career so far with us, the reader.This book is easy to read and the recipes are easy to follow.From the start the author gives us the history of bread in the world and what flavours and techniques they use.I would recommend this book to everyone."
4,"Really, quite good.","I'm not going to make you read a tome just to find out what i think. This book has such a wealth of knowledge to help you improve your bread baking skills. The formula instructions are clear and easy to understand. The only drawbacks that this book brings are in it's quality of publishing. The book was published in China, it is hardcover but, the cover stock used is very weak and flexes under the weight of the book.Just wanted to let you know that the quality of the information surpasses the quality of the book itself."
5,VENDORS WITH AMAZON,"THE BREAD BAKERS APPRENTICE-COOKBOOKJUST WANTED TO APPLAUD THIS SELLER.SHE WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO MAKE THIS A SPECIAL EVENT,THE BOOK WAS PERFECT,THE SELLER WAS SUPER AND I WILL BE BACK . ANNIE IN TEXAS"
1,Good Bread Shouldn't be this Complicated,"This book may be good for a professional but if you want good bread that's uncomplicated and easy to make, skip this book. The directions are complex and difficult to follow. All the recipes take many days to complete while the end result is rarely as pictured or described. This is not a book for a novice baker."
2,Hype,"People have been baking bread for eons. Some have been doing it very well. Many lots better than what is described in this book. Lousy Ciabatta, dubious starter. Seems to be a case of not seeing the forest for the trees."
3,Great book for bakers,Ever want to make a braid bread that didn't look like three worms in love? Wonder why your rye bread was hard as a rock? This book is full of tips and insights that will help you be a better baker.
3,Just OK.,"The pictures are beautiful. I learned more from the photographs than the written content. When I'm reading instructions for a recipe, the last thing I want to do is have to refer back to a previously written book for the explanation of what something means or how it's done. Great way to plug your previous book, but who has time for that?"
2,"It says 6"" but it's not it's smaller than that","My 6"" chemminy pipe bigger than this tee 6"" and when I checked it it's 5"" some that why it's lose"
4,Great evangelical message with super content!,"This small book of 9 chapters reads like 9 sermons, all filled with Biblical references and examples from Moody's own life.It details all the reasons to find God and is particularly convincing in layman's terms. I'd love to see how a non-believer would respond to these messages.In particular, I loved the example of the man who chose to commit his life to Jesus, even though the ""revelation"" he felt was minimal. In his mind, he believed in the Gospel and wanted to know God. At the moment of saying yes, the revelation struck him. Great to read as in this modern world, so often we emphasise the ""feeling"" aspect of believing before we accept Jesus. Sometimes God works through the head too.There's a super chapter on Repentance which I particularly liked.This is a powerful book that focuses on the theology of a very personal and loving God, who so desperately wants intimacy with all of us. I'd recommend it to everyone."
4,Interesting looking over a 100 years ago at Faith,Fun and quick to read. Should be read by a person who is solid in their walk with the Lord.
4,The Way to God and How to Find It,"I have enjoyed this book. I haven't finished it yet, but I will. I go back & forth sometimes with books."
2,Sorry,"A mediocre book on a very important subject. The authors points are presumably valid, but boring to read, as he explains the same concept in many repetitive ways. I would not recommend"
4,The Way to God.....,"This book was good and I liked it, but I found that some of the vocabulary was a little too deep for me to understand right away. (Just pushed on word to define on my kindle). Other than that, I found it to be enlightening and a great read."
3,It is OK lether case for ZS7,"Leather Camera Pouch LAGOS6B is perfect fit for ZS7, but the belt-loop is too weak for camera.The Cameta Camera sent the case on time."
1,lkt,"I was able to remove about 4 links and push 2 pins back in, then it quit working--it wouldn't push the pins out anymore. The pin pusher wasn't centered properly, and as I twisted the screw it moved around so much it was hard to get it centered onto the watch pin. This is a very cheap pin remover, not worth the money."
1,dont buy this junk,this thing is a piece of junk..i just got it out of the box..and the pin that removes the links is already bent..and i so far i have 1 link removed..dont even waste your money on this piece of trash
1,Do not spend money on this unit,"Seller sold me a unit that could not even resize the band for one watch, He told me in the initial email it could be defective unit, I think it is sellers responsibility to replace the defective unit. when I contacted about it to seller after initial email he just ignored it and never returned replies to my email, I will not buy anything from this seller again very poor service."
3,Not quite the same.,"I've used this product for 7 years as it has morphed through a few branding changes with name and packaging, however, the product had always remained the same. However, this time although the packaging is the same, the tint is lighter, not quite as dark in color. Moisturizing aspect seems the same, however, the lighter tint is a bit disappointing."
5,Nice & Refreshing,"Daniel Austin is an awesome addition to the jazz & pop industry! Nice fusion between the two genres. It's an awesome, light, refreshing album!!! You got your occasional sax, elecric guitar, constant good beats, nice vocals, backup singers, even an intro from what seems to be a chinese flute in one of the songs.If you're having a nice light-hearted party, this is a must get! Serve it up with a bottle of nice wine and you got yourself a good delightful evening! You and your friends will definitely enjoy the light beats that'll fill every moment of dull silence. Some even called Daniel Austin's album ""the top 20 soul album of 2004"". And indeed, I would agree 100%. Daniel Austin is a must-check-out upcoming jazz artist. Don't fall behind! -get the album today ;)ps. Your can hear some sapmle songs @ http://www.danielaustin.com/Enjoy!-CB"
1,What a waste,"They decided to leave out a great many sets. No UD any year, any set: no Playoff any year, any set: no Upper Deck Pros & Prospects, Classics, Pro Sigs, or Leather & Lumber, Origins, Topps Turkey Red. These are just the sets we found missing so far. According to Beckett, this book has ""Complete checklists and pricing for every important baseball card set from 1909 to present"", yet they skip some of the most actively traded sets on the internet. Seems they are either totally out of the loop to what is important, or else are hoping to add more customers to their Online Price Guides. This book really doesn't even rate 1 star. If you want complete pricing, better look elsewhere."
3,its alright,"For the price i got it at ($3.50) it was pretty good. It doesn't go as far as other spring pistols but hey, for 3.50, what'd you expect? I'd reccomend buying this gun AS A BACKUP, at no time should you use it on its own.By the way don't shoot with he bb's it comes with, those bb's are deformed and can damage or destroy your firing mechanism"
1,Not worth buying,"Feels extremely fragile and rightly so, since it broke the first time I test fired it. Fortunately, I got it for free with another purchase. I wouldn't recommend this gun even for beginners."
3,Should have been great - what happened?,"It seems like it should be so easy to make an excllent short film. Not too much time to have much go wrong right? WRONG!These were terrible. I have to confess, I didn't make it all the way through and started some furious fast forwarding hoping to find something salvagable in my 3.99 rental.Wish I had 1 positive thing to say. I would say it. But this was just bad. Sorry!"
4,works fine,"Unlike the other review, my avanti compact freezer/fridge did not soak everything. It kept food nice, cold, and dry. I used it mainly as a freezer and it fit in quite a lot for its size. One great thing about it is that it does go down to true freezing temperature and easily keeps ice like a normal freezer, very unlike a unit that has fridge and freezer in one. And it has the capability to be a fridge as well (though not at the same time as if you used it as a freezer). My only complaint is that it can be a bit noisy for my taste. If you keep it in a room you don't sleep in, it shouldn't be a problem. Or if you have a studio, it would be ideal to keep it in a cupboard or nook to minimize the noise. Bur really it wasn't annoyingly loud just enough to notice if you were sleeping in the same room with it."
1,Lousy fridge or freezer,Everything in the unit is kept soaking wet because the unit does not work properly. It's discontinued for a reason I guess.
4,It Turned Me On,"I don't dig real hard music. Go ahead, call me a little girl, but i just like mello stuff. But I do dig this album, it's very cool, the lyrics and vocals are very good, and the drums kick my teeth in. they are hard to find, but the music videos for this album are...interesting. If you don't have it, but it."
2,I have read much better,"This book left much to be desired. It lacked detail, words were misspelled, left out, or not the correct word for the application. The book was incomplete."
2,A poor copy of HP's included documentation,"HP ships ""HP-UX System Administration Tasks"" with each machine or copy of the OS. It is a FAR better book than Marty's. This is a weak introduction to sysadmin at best, and has been done better by many others. (Nemeth et al. for instance)Don't waste your money."
1,total junk,"The edge bars welded onto the circular post holes are unevenly spaced - you can't get a single shelf to lay flat on a hard surface.The bottom bars are bent or warped, which is crazy for a shelf - how hard is it to make a flat surface in 2011.I can't believe Amazon would even sell this product. Now I have to waste my very limited time packaging this back up, creating a return, and taking it to UPS. Then I get to wait 2-3 weeks for Amazon to refund this piece of junk.I'll probably take/post some pictures tomorrow to save people from this product."
5,light weight a real plus,"I am pleased with this scope. I do not have experience with many scopes so I could not comment on the relative image quality compared to others. The larger Kwan scopes receive high ratings by reviewers, but I did not find a review of this smaller Kwan . The big plus with this scope is the relatively small size and light weight. This feature makes possible using a lower cost and lower weight tripod such as those designed for a camera. Thus, the whole package can be easily transported."
1,Save Your Money.,"Too much money for 32 minutes of Geddy is very bad value for money. Do yourself a favour and spend your coin replacing some of your Rush vinyl with one of the band's CD remasters. I suspect if RUSH were aware that this crap existed they'd be very disappointed in the producers of it.Definitely a ""C minus, must try harder"" for this item."
3,Constricting freedoms,"3 1/2While it is easy to appreciate Veloso's unique effect upon his country's music, often I am just not rubbed the right way with his recordings. Remastering could help a lot, since it sounds like a combination of elements conspire to keep these impressively written numbers datedly at bay."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"To try and confuse people more, this version of the Legion of Super Heroes, entitled The Legion, decided to add Superboy to their roster. This is yet another different Superboy, and a rather reckless young lad, diving headfirst into attempting to solve some of the problems he encounters in the 30th century.A strange thing to do, this."
4,Good stuff.,"From Letters to Cleo to ""Josie and the Pussycats"" and the ""10 Things I Hate About You"" soundtrack, I really dig most of Kay Hanley's work. This EP is no exception. It's solid, and despite the title, she hasn't lost that aggressive edge that I've always enjoyed. Most comparable to ""Cherry Marmalade"" in sound and style, if a little more ""slow-and-steady"" on the whole. A must-have for big Hanley fans, a ""you won't be disappointed"" for general lovers of polished, female-lead pop-rock."
2,This interview was terrble,"This interview sounds terrble! Don't blame ozzy! It sound terrable cause they recorded it at a public place with lots of people around(AND A STINKING VIDIO GAME ARCADE!) By the sound of that interview, The interviewer was trying to get Ozzy drunk but the interview took too much of his own stuff! LOL! Don't buy it."
2,Stick To Singing Mr.Ozzy!!!!,"First of all,I love Ozzy's music. The man is a legend but let's get real. Ozzy has done alot of drugs in his day and it has affected him. The interview could be cool but Ozzy can barely speak at times and his constant mumbling makes this thing barely listenable."
2,"Great concept, not-so-great execution ....","This might have been a very nice, useful product. However, the tweezers are 3rd-rate: uneven, offset, and the tips don't meet down the entire length. The light is bright, and the general idea is excellent. But these are supposed to be tweezers, and that part just doesn't work that well. In fact, it barely works at all. Two stars for the light only -- I think I may be able to remove the tweezers and use the light as a mini-flashlight"
2,cheap but not great,"I bought this tweezer primarily because it was so cheap (less than $5). While the packaging is great, and the concept ingenious, the end product is mediocre at best. With the light, the tweezers are quite heavy and did not meet to a perfect point giving me only a 1 out of 5 hair success rate. Also, the light is a very narrow, very bright, white light which only marginally made it easier to locate hairs. I thought it might be a fun gift but after trying it out for myself, decided against gifting it."
3,LED light is BRIGHT.,Not a bad product but don't point the LED directly at your eye for any reason. I happened to look down at it and had to look away for a few seconds till I could see properly again.
5,Excellent,The product came right away and was in excellent condition. I'm taking a class online and the product and it has already been a great resource.
2,Disappointed !,"I got a Stedman's Dictionary with a class I'm taking and found it to be disappointing if you're just beginning to learn new terms. The definitions are longwinded and often abtuse. I didn't feel a flow of jumping from word to word and understanding what I'm reading without having to consult an online dictionary. This dictionary got me frustrated after looking up a few words.I'm looking into purchasing a Mosby's since that seems to be the one online with the clearest, most concise definitions. I'll see how that turns out. The only advantage of Stedman's Medical Dictionary that I can tell is that it has about 100,000 terms in it, about double the Mosby's, so I would keep it around for once you're at an advanced level of learning."
3,You can't trust a book by it's cover...,"Good dictionary. However, there are better ones (particularly Tabers). I have less physically attractive medical dictionaries with no color and a boring cover that seem to have the definitions I am looking for when Stedman's doesn't. Adequate dictionary but perhaps Taber's in a better value."
3,Not for medical professionals,"This is a good book. It provides basic information on many topics; however, it is not a worthwhile investment for a medical student. Medical students and doctors are held to a significantly higher standard of knowledge than this book (or really any book of this sort) can offer.For quick reference you'll do better using UpToDate or any of the numerous electronic references avalable at any good medical school / teaching hospital.If you are not looking for an MD level of knowledge then this isn't a bad book. Of course you could save your money and get the same thing off the web faster, but that is really personal preference."
1,Broke in 2.5 months,"I enjoyed this LCD, even though several sources not to trust Magnavox/Philips electronics. The Magnavox has really cheap speakers, a non-universal remote, problems with bright reds, but it was still a decent LCD for the price and had a max res of 1080P. However, after 2.5 months the Magnavox developed a bad column of pixels, which ruined the display."
1,Has Problems!,When I first got this tv I was amazed at how I got such a good deal. The picture quality is excellent and the price was great. After about 3 months it started having problems. It started taking longer and longer for the tv to turn on. Now it takes about 10 to 15 min to turn on. Also after 6 months it is starting to have trouble with the ATSC/Qam tuner. HD channels are starting to go blank. I wish I could return it but now I am stuck with it.Thanks Magnavox.
4,not a bad tv,"i've had this tv for almost a year now. it looks great with my verizon fios hd service. i havent had any problems with it, so i dont what others are talking about. good bang for the buck"
5,Usage,"I bought this set from another vendor. So far haven't had any problems, Excellent picture, great color, can't say anything about reliablility, only had it TV for a week. Seems to be a great TV."
2,Unreadable (what a pity),"I SO wanted to read this book all the way through--and love it--because the basic idea is excellent. But from the first paragraph, it's all cutsey-pie, puke-inducing prose that you can't believe someone really used to fill up an entire book. Not only that Everything Is In Title Case, Which Makes It Very Difficult To Determine What's Important And What's Not. Why didn't they just use ALL CAPS? SAME ANNOYING THING. I put it down after a chapter and a half, and it's a pity because it probably has some really good ideas buried within. I likely won't bother with the first one unless I thumb through it at the library."
1,"Crass, tacky grrls","Filled with name-dropping, label-dropping, and snobby ""witticisms,"" this book is an ugly, mean book. Far from a book on how to behave, it's a guidebook on things *not* to do. If it's meant to be funny, it failed, at least for me."
2,Got what I expected,"I can't complain about the seller. Price was right and the clothes arrived quickly. Unfortunately, I quickly learned that I don't like tack cloths.They're _very_ sticky (significantly more so than I expected) and you really need to use gloves with them. I didn't at first and it took a while before I got the crap off my hands. I also found they didn't do a great job at removing residual dust from the wood I was working on since you couldn't really run them over the wood easily. In the end, I didn't use them at all. A good lint free cloth, some compressed air and a vacuum attachment got the job done well."
2,Be Careful of this product,"This is a nice scanner so far as it goes, but it is very old and does NOT work with newer operating systems such as Windows Vista or Windows 7. HP stopped supporting this product with updated drivers a few years ago and it won't work with a newer computer. I just purchased this scanner for home and we are still running Windows Vista, and it DOESN'T WORK! So unless you are running a Windows Operating system that is at least 10 years old, it probably won't work! I would check the HP site for drivers and what it works with before purchasing this product."
1,"No book, No Answers","I ordered textbooks from several sites and received all within a week. Order from this seller still had not arrived after 20 days. Worse yet, I sent three emails which went unanswered even though I specifically asked for confirmation that the emails were received."
3,ok Study Guide,"The book was labeled as good but was pretty beat up. The pages were very wrinkly due to water damage, and there was a torn page in the book. The book was pretty cheap, so I guess I got what I paid for.Study Guide for Organic Chemistry: Structure and Reactivity"
5,Great book,"Great book so meaningful! I really enjoyed this very encouraging and exhorting book, would recommend to anyone, a very short read"
4,Well written history!,"This book is a good read for anyone who has a limited knowledge of astronomy, especially from a historical perspective. I would have rated it five stars, however I would have like to have seen a little more discussion about celestial mechanics (the movement, alignment, and rotation of the planets) along with illustrations. I found it somewhat cumbersome to intereperet some of the early models of the universe without charts or other illustrations. Overall though a very well written book."
5,it's really lovely,"This LP in it's original Double-album form was one my favorites of the era (the early seventies being a little sparse and sometimes unoriginal), but when the CD's came out, they split the thing into 2 separate discs. So this one has lots of dreamy, drug induced pop (""pale blue eyes', ""I'll be your Mirror') , and some atmospherics ('Ocean')as well as the classics (""Heroin, White Light/White Heat').Good for fans, good for people who liked their studio stuff, also."
4,There is Live 1 and Live 2,Why they broke this up could only be motivated by greed. However this helps you appreciate Lou Reeds roots. Probably one of the underated American song smiths. Many of these songs form the basis of Lou Reeds Solo Career.
5,This review should not be necessary,"Why they didn't just pack it together as one double CD is beyond me, as the original record was all one set. This just means I have to write two ***** reviews instead of one. But yes, Volume 2 is just as good as Volume 1, and they both are classics. In fact, I like a lot of the songs on this one (""Herion"", ""Sweet Bonnie Brown"", ""Pale Blue Eyes"", ""White Light/White Heat"") better than the originals. In the case of ""White Light..."", it's probably because you get a longer version of a good thing.This makes it the rarest of live albums, in that the material here is at least as good or better than the original. I also like that you can hear the band really get down and rock on a few numbers, just to show they are a ROCK band, and not the toys of the art crowd.I thank those who released this, as it was a very hard to find work for awhile."
5,THE BEST Velvets Album,"This is one of the rare cases when volume 2 is better than the first. Of course, it would be best to buy both but if you have to pick one, pick this volume.This is the album that made me really appreciate the Velvets. I love live music and this album really captures the band as they were meant to be heard -- Jamming, Moody, Rock and Roll. The first 3 songs especially (Ocean, Pale Blue Eyes, and Heroin) have reverberated in my musical memory for a very long time.A GREAT FIRST VU ALBUM! If you know the Velvets or even just think you might like them, you can't go wrong with these live concerts."
4,If you have the 1st one you must get this...or vice versa,"Volume 2 picks up where the first one leaves off, opening with a ten minute version of OCEAN, complete with Crashing waves of cymbals. This also has rare gems you cant find anywhere else like the short but sweet OVER YOU, and the 50's rockabilly, speed freak sounding combo of SWEET BONNIE BROWN/IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.Then there is the extended noise drone of WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT.Just more evidence that the VU were a real loose dirty rock band who were more at home playing in dive bars than the early Warhol era trendy art crowd."
4,Cute As A Button!,"Got these for my grandson (6 yr old) for his first concert (Maiden). They are very small, but the size advertised...1 in. Still pretty cool. I think he'll love them. I received them quickly...ordered Aug. 3rd and received them Aug. 9th."
4,Sir Elton at his best ...,"There's something amazing and magical about seeing a master performer such as Sir Elton John live on the stage. Gives one a natural high! Well, for those of you who haven't been lucky yet to see Sir Elton live, this CD has three tracks recorded live in Paris. It's the next best thing to ... (you know how the rest goes!) ... highly recommend it. A fan in Atlanta."
5,There's More Where That Came From,"Lee Ann Womack can ""REALLY' sing all types of songs but, she is at her best when she sings those sad country songs! This album just came out and I'm already looking forward to her ""next"" one!But, no rush Lee Ann, this one was well worth the wait! Thanks!!!"
5,Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!,From start to finish-a fantastic cd! Future Album of the Year winner without a doubt! Way to go-Lee Ann! You've done it again!
3,Some strong songs,"While this album isn't as consistently good as her first two, it's heading back in the right direction. My guess is her handlers realize the ""I Hope You Dance"" Faith Hill-Shania Twain pop-fluff era of ""country"" is being chased out of town by the likes of Gretchen Wilson and Joe Nichols. ""I May Hate Myself In the Morning"" and ""There's More Where That Came From"" are far and away the strongest cuts, many of the rest are pretty mediocre and don't reflect well on the person who ultimately made the call (the producer?) on their inclusion."
5,WOW!,"Just another great CD. I especially love ""I'm Gonna Love You Tonight""-- it brings you back to the true days of country but can surprisingly still appeal to lots of people. Its such a good song, I really like how she can produce songs that are true to the country roots. ""Stubborn"" is a good song, too. Can't quite emphasize how great of an artist Womack is-- she puts so much emotion into her songs that you love it from the start! I'd buy it if you haven't already."
2,Fans can never be objective,"From an OBJECTIVE reviewer...it's nice background music, but nothing memorable."
3,I May Hate ....,"My rating is based only on the single I May Hate Myself in the Morning, and after hearing that, something sounded very familiar, so I dug out my copy of Luckenbach Texas. She completely 100% remade that song, just re-wrote the lyrics to suit her. I'm not saying her song (cover) isn't good, it is, but I would have expected to see some kind of recognition for Luckenbach Texas besides the music of the chorus sounding like ""Hank Williams pain songs, Newberry's train songs and blue eyes cryin' in the rain""."
2,THOUHGT IT WOULD BE BETTER,"I BOUGHT THIS CD BECAUSE ""IM GONNA HATE MYSELF IN THE MORNING"" IS A GREAT SONG. BUT THE REST OF THE CD WAS NOT WHAT I HAD HOPED IT WOULD BE. LEE ANN WOMACK HAS A GREAT VOICE, BUT TO ME SONGS ON THIS CD WERE NOT THAT GOOD. I JUST REPEAT IM GONNA HATE MYSELF......... OVER AND OVER BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT SONG."
3,OUTDATED state info--but the rest of the book IS useful!,"The book has 300 pages of supposedly ""state-specific"" information of where speed traps are located, but I wouldn't exactly call it that. While the book does list scanner frequencies for the various police agencies, I have found that most of them are OUTDATED. The book even has pictures of police cars from some of the states, but the pictures are of 1980's cop cars--very unhelpful. The first 50 pages has info on how to avoid tickets, as well as technical, AND USEFUL information on radar, laser, and radar detectors. While most, NOT ALL, of the state info is useless, I still think that this book is worth buying. The info on radar and laser, etc. is very detailed, and you'll have a good idea of how they work, and the errors they make, after you read this book."
3,Decent interview which captures an era,"This is a Cd of an interview with Ian Gillan, conducted in 1984 during the rehearsals which led up to the Perfect Strangers tour. The Mk. 2 lineup had just gotten back together, and the acrimony between Gillan and Blackmore had not quite sunk in yet. The band was excited about their new release (decent but not the best album ever), and they were raring to go. Gillan offers his candid insights on the music business, about the press' perception of Deep Purple, plus his approach to songwriting (the music comes first, then the words; he uses ""Rat Bat Blue"" as an example and then discusses his own band's ""Lusitania Express""). He also admits he's never listened to Burn and Stormbringer and claims that he's never going back to his solo stuff (which proved to be untrue, as the 89-92 period found us with a deluge of solo stuff). Gillan's personality comes through, very friendly and unassuming, but how many times will anyone besides a Purple diehard listen to this?"
4,"Great pictures will satisfy divers, snorkellers","This book has what snorkellers and SCUBA divers demand most from a fish identification book: Plenty of great color pictures on high quality glossy paper. Strong binding and good paper mean that you can take it with you to the water without it falling apart. And if that were not good enough, the text is informative and complete enough for all but the most committed ichthyologist. A keeper."
3,meh expected more out of the Singer brand,"Cheap thin plastic, cheap knobs, form is partially distorted on one of the hip sides - I really expected a lot more out of the Singer brand. For local stores to charge in upwards of $200 for this item is nothing short of a rip off. At half that on amazon I feel its still too much for the lack of quality. $60 maybe $75 would be fair but anything more than that keep looking."
4,Super cool retro,I bought this for my mom for her birthday as she sews clothing. It is so awesome. It's a beautiful dress form and durable and just as the pictures depict and the description shows. A+.
3,Flimsy,"I was a little disappointed that the dress form was as flimsy as it was. The parts are almost all plastic, even the stand. I keep it in a corner where it won't get bumped because I don't think it could take too much abuse. I was a nervous wreck when my son started turning the dials and asking, ""what does this do?"". It definitely couldn't stand up to boys! All in all I suppose its ok, especially considering the great price I paid compared to what they wanted at the fabric store."
2,Not a Helpful Tool,"I bought this dress form because my previous dress form was no longer my size and I needed a replacement. I chose this one for the price and it was a brand name. I was very disappointed in the shape of the form. The waist is too low it is really at the top of the hips and the natural waist line area never changes; so when you adjust the form, you end up with a wasp waist and a huge lumpy bottom! The shape that takes place is not at all correct. When I would adjust for the hip, the ""waist"" got bigger! The dials are cheesy and this just isn't a quality product, even for a low price item. I returned it."
4,Serves it purpose,Well... what can I say? It's an adjustable dress form. That's what it does. It works as promised. It's easy to put together and works well.
2,Very cheaply made,"When I first saw this dress form I was very excited about getting it. Amazon and Company shipped the item in great timing but when I got it. Overall, the item was poorly made. I was very dissapointed and sent back the product. The company refunded my money without incidents."
3,which are the materials that made this article?,"please give me an Paking LIST of this article, I need to know what materials is developed.I look forward to your prompt response.Thanks in advance."
3,Check Size Carefully,"I was a bit frustrated to find after I ordered this that a dress form size medium is *nowhere close* to a women's size medium. When I ordered the product, the size was not clearly stated in the product description. I guess they have updated it, now saying that the Medium dress form is for a women's size 16 - 22.I did miss the inch measurements, so the order is partly my bad. But be sure to dig through the fine print to ensure you are ordering the proper size. Wish it had been front and center so that I didn't have to order / return / reorder again."
2,Does not last at all,"I don't make that many clothes, but compared to the real dress forms that cost a few hundred dollars, this is junk! First out of the box it seems pretty cool, but after a while the gears start to become difficult to turn and pieces will stick. The cover is also really hard to pin into, you have to pin it like you're piecing fabric together, but when you're using a dressform, it's easier to just stick a pin in like a push pin! Also it is not realistic. If you measure your body and adjust, it is not a good clone to you. The boobs especially are problematic, the torso slopes into them too much instead of having it be more realistic. This is a problem if you like to make very structured and fitted clothes. And the gaps are extremely annoying when working with it. If you are serious about sewing clothes for yourself, look into other alternatives because this just doesn't cut it."
2,Get what you pay for,"Low quality item. I got this form expecting Singer to provide a good quality product. I was sadly mistaken and sent it back the very next day after I got it. I would like to give this product a good review because I don't want to drag Singer's name through the dirt, but it just is not up to par. The plates of the form overlap at the smallest settings and, even at the larger settings, do not stay put. You definitely will get what you pay for. Also, be cautious when choosing the size of the form if you do choose to get this one. The small/med is more like a med/lrg-xl. If you are a petite person, it might be better to go with a petite-sized form. The good news is that Amazon return policies were simple and great about a quick full-refund! Thanks, Amazon.com!!"
5,A Nice CD-length Interview!,"This CD is an interview recorded somewhere around 1987. The CD label fails to cite the date, or name the interviewer! A very nice interview consisting mostly of late 60s Beatles stories about the failure to finish Let it Be, the breakup of the partnership, and the effect it had on them. Paul also discusses coping with John Lennon's death, the highlight of the cd. There are no Wings or solo-era questions asked during the interview, oddly enough. One annoying part of the interview is all the car horns honking outside--until Paul gets up and closes the door! Sound quality is decent for what sounds like a handheld tape recording."
2,Verizon FIOS,Got this for my media box to run all my TV cables to when I hooked it went from a good signal to poor singal and a hugh lost in picture quality. upgrade to there 2GHZ vresion Leviton 47690-8C2 1X8 Passive Video Splitter Module to see if it would work still same thing ended up with very poor quality picture end up having to go back to my old radio shack splitters very disapointed was looking forward to have a nice clean and organized spliter. The other thing I didn't like about this was lack of labling there was no sticker or diagram to know where each cable went to and from all it has is 8 label IN and the 1 labled OUT
2,Not impressed,"After using several individual splitters, I wanted to clean-up my distribution box along with addressing periodic digital signal/channel drop out on a couple of our TVs. Immediately after installing all 4 of our TVs through this splitter, I had digital reception issues on several of the sets. It seems to work ok on my newest LC LED TV, but my older Sharp Aquos LCD and another set do not recognize any of the digital channels. I tried going through the TV set-up on both sets and could not restore those channels without by-passing this splitter. I am going to call TW before returning it, but I am optimistic this type will work for my needs."
2,Sexy lady - high class ho - not much going on in the script,"Just a simple textbook crime spree by thrill-seeking, amateur kleptomaniacs. Which ends in the expected. Lackluster script that moves waaay too slowly; not many ideas. The lady's sexy, and for gay or female viewers, the men are not bad either, but otherwise? Teh!"
4,The Definitive Book on Valuing Players,"For those of you that have wrestled with the issue of dollar values, position scarcity and valuing a player's future value in preparation for your rotisserie draft, this book is for you. McGee outlines a step-by-step method to set up his insightful valuation method in a spreadsheet. It really makes sense and it works too! I have been using the McGee method for the past two seasons and it has noticeably improved my draft performance. With all the information readily available to fellow owners it is much more difficult to find an edge at draft day. My spreadsheet gives me that edge.It took me an hour or two to set up the spreadsheet the first year, but since then, I just plug and play."
4,Easy to follow method for analyzing players,"The book is great for beginners and for experienced roto guys. McGee lays out a simple way to value players as well as a more complicated option theory approach. The only drawback I see is that the baselines he uses are a little dated (1996) because of the home run explosion and expansion. Overall, a great book."
4,Glad the rest of my fantasy league doesn't read it.,I believe some of the option logic to be flawed. But as a basis for how to create dollar values for players its the only solid full explanation source I know of.
2,Fight through the Numbers...,"If you have ever read up on the physics behind the principles of combustion, force, and friction to be able to fix your car's motor, then this book is for you. If, however, you trust that the people publishing roto projections and dollar amounts can't be too far apart on their methodology, then take a decent average of the amounts given in various magazine publications and leave this one on the shelf. This book has a high level of research that you'll have to do to make use of it's contents, and you'll need a computer spreadsheet for the data entry and calculations required, but if you've got the time (and no wife...) it's a winner."
1,"The closerm season 7, episode 12","I just viewed the episode 12, of Season 7 and it was the worst bit of writing, acting and directing I have ever witnessed.What a waste of time! I know it is difficult to remain fresh after so many years, but why not just show reruns instead.Yuk can't even begin to express how awful it was."
2,the closer season 7,"hi! the closer is in its 7th and last season,now we know why, here's hopeing they come up with a ending that meets the cast skills."
5,"Always good! Cannot seem to get enough, Going to miss this show!","I really love this last season, I am sorry to see Brenda go! I especially liked the last episode, she summed up all the seasons in the last episode."
5,The Closer: Star Turn,I love these programs. A strong but flawed woman/human being is juggling her personal life with a successful career and is strong enough to not always play exactly by the rules. My favorite type of person!
4,What will happen to Brenda?,Will she have a guest appearance next season? What about the leak in her department? Nothing feels resolved. I liked the episode but the storyline is left hanging.
5,Great Show,This was a fantastic end to a great show. Well done!!! I would watch this show over and over again.
2,Unimpressed,"Poor visual quality. I was hoping for HD, but it looked more like VHS. Maybe I should have order the DVD instead."
2,Disappointing (Season 7 Episode 12),"At a time when we know the series is coming to an end they make an episode centered on Fred Willard with lots of camera time for his drunken, barfing, nasty character rather than letting us in on what's going on with the lawsuit, Fritz and Brenda Lee, and hints of how the other characters will fare when the series ends. I have watched this show because I care about the regular characters, so much camera time of the drunk Santa was an insult. Unfortunately this is absolutely the worst episode of the entire series."
5,Deputy Chief Johnson Will Be Missed,I had a standing date with Brenda Leigh Johnson every Monday night and I always ended the evening feeling satisfied that justice had been served and the Major Case Squad stood firmly on the size of right. I have every season of The Closer and watching favorite shows is like visiting with an old friend. The supporting cast is excellent but my favorites are Sgt. Gabriel and Lt. Provenza. It's a pleasure to watch the team work together and solve the puzzle that is criminal behavior.
5,TOTAL Closer Fan,"LOVE this show and miss it. As all of us Closer Fans know, this was probably one of the best seasons for the show (although every season had its various episode GEMS like Good Housekeeping and Ruby, just to name a couple). I will say I was disappointed in the Season Finale ... I think it should have been two hours and not so rushed, but still had the poignant ending and gave the show a good send off and nice seguay into Major Crimes."
4,Road Block,"As usual this show starts off with power and then pulls it up the rest of the way. And the characters that are usually two dimensional in most shows are three, maybe four dimensional, in this one. That is one of the things I love about these shows, even the ""backup"" characters can develop and shine."
5,I hated it when Kyra Sedgwick left the series.,The Closer's series was such a treat. Real thinking required as the Closer fought to solve every case and not necessarily according to the law but certainly justice for the victim.
5,The Closer; series,"This is a series I loved, I have all six series and am awaiting the release of the seventh episode to complete the set.Kyra sedgwick is a very good actress and plays her part really well. There is also the odd bit of comedy it makes for very enjoyable watching.Acquarius"
1,can not download on galaxy tab,I was not able to download it on my samsung galaxy 2 10.1 tab. thi needs flash and the tab will not allow it so I can not view any of my digital downloads.
2,$52?!?!? YOU MUST BE KIDDING!,"Even for one of the very best written, acted and produced shows in the history of television, this price is unbelievable and a non-starter. I've read how cheap it is to make DVDs, so this feels like highway robbery. Too bad. I'll just have to wait and hope it comes down to a more affordable - and reasonable - price."
1,My review is of amazon not the episode...,"Since I can't watch the episode, this is a review of amazon. I just downloaded the last episode and paid for it on amazon and can't watch it. What gives? I've never had a problem watching an episode on Tuesday on my IPad."
1,No Woman no Cry...?? Huh?,I thought the series was back on track with the shooting in the drug house.... Then the Deputy Chief has to be rescued by one of her detectives... I guess her blond hair got in the way???Then as if that was not bad enough she gets a confession out of the blue?... And this time instead of the Closer crying... Another woman cries at the end???Who is writing this crap? The series was a hit because of strong female character....Blah! My 10 year old nephew can write a better story!
4,Sad when a good thing comes to an end.,"Brilliant show, but the last three episodes were emotionally draining. You could tell that Deputy Chief Johnson was tired and it was approaching the end. She had faced enough death and with constant watchers surrounding her, her ability to get to the truth was being strained."
5,Love it!,Such a great show with a marvelous cast. We enjoy popping in an episode every now and then in the evening.
4,not complete,"I have watched every episode on TNT from the pilot until the last one when Brenda said good-bye. My mother owns every season, I just purchased Season 7 for her. I watched every episode and found one episode clearly absent from the set. It's the episode where Flynn was targeted to be killed. Why wasn't it included in the series? I'm very disappointed, my mother doesn't have cable or satellite tv so she relies on the series dvds. Not happy because it's not complete as advertised."
4,The Closer: The Complete Seventh Season,"As with all the seasons and shows of this wonderful series, this was well worth the wait and price. I will watch it for years. It certainly completes the set."
1,Agreement on this being the worst episode ever,"Like the previous reviewers said: if you want to see a pathetically acted drunk Santa pawing all the female characters and all of the guys drooling over the guest actress who played Buzz's sister, then this is the one for you. Everybody's acting was off... even the best actors looked like amateurs. The humor was not funny. The writing and directing atrocious. There was no plot development of the other major plot lines. It was definitely the worst episode ever."
4,Goodbye and Thank you very very much,"I thought this was a good premise to have Stroh back, but everything seemed way too rushed.Was it just me or did the characters all feel like they were talking super fast ? A two parter was an absolute necessity. I had so many questions like what happen to Rusty's mom ? Will Brenda and Fritz adopt him ? The kid who played Rusty was wonderful and loved how him and Brenda were so much alike in temperment and life.You have to watch last rites episode first because things are said about her mother which will not make sense otherwise. Also Stroh showing up at her house , seems very unlikely. He is way too smooth to do something that stupid, rattled or not. I thought the ending was hysterical and well crafted."
5,"IF YOU LIKE DRAMA YOU WILL LOVE ""THE CLOSER""",A well written drama. An excellent set of cast members. Humor is included. You get to know the personalities and interactions between their other actors. I was sorry to see the series. end.
5,The Closer,This was a gift for the wife and an absolute winner!!!! Too brad it had to end. She has the whole series.
5,Closer not finished till summer 2012,"The Closer is my all-time favourite TV show and I have to come to the States to watch current episodes since it's not available in Canada. There were 10 shows in the summer, 5 this winter, and the final 6 next summer, so the seventh season won't be out until after that. I'm surprised that Amazon is listing the DVD for pre-sale already. I wish TNT was taking a page from Glee and offering the final season in two parts so I'd be able to purchase Part 1 now. I'm working on being very patient. I'm going to miss Kyra Sedgwick's fine acting and her Brenda Leigh character."
5,And so it ends...,A spectacular season once again. It is very disappointing to see the end of a spectacular show. Very well completed and wraps up all the loose ends still leaving it open for rebirth if we could only be so lucky.
5,it can't be over!,But i guess all things must come to an end. I suggest getting the whole series and watching from the very beginning to the end. No commercials and you are in control.
3,The Last Closer Episode,"Thanks Amazon for making it possible to get the last story of the Closer series. I watched them all but something came up and I missed it.To me the last episode did not give the feeling of a true end of a story. Brenda was going back to Atlanta for what? To hep her Daddy move? For the funeral? What? It was the perfect time for her to do something for Fritz....he wanted to move somewhere to advance his career. Why wasn't that worked in? Why did the Commander be left in his position or take Brenda's? The only true ""Brenda"" scene was the pocketbook scene. I love it. I love the whole series, just the LAST ONE sucked."
5,the closer,"Loved this show for the last seven years! I will truly miss Brenda, and ""Thank yaw!"" The show's supporting actors were also great, and it was so special to see them present her with a new bag. I was shocked about her mother's sudden death, and Brend's powerful reaction upon finding her mother has died in her sleep.The cast is great, and the shows had you on the edge of seat until the end. What a show?"
3,The perfect recipie!,"So, I'm a huge fan of the bottled raspberry iced teas. I've loved all of them I've ever tried, except for the Brisk one. Anyways, I wanted to stop throwing my money away, and start making my own. I bought this type of tea and boiled it on the stove, to find it had a very deep red appearance. When I tried the tea, it was very VERY sweet and didn't at all taste like tea. So, I was thinking about the bottled tea I drink, and noticed how it is brown, and has a hint of raspberry taste. So, what I did was I combined half a cup of regular brewed Lipton tea with this raspberry tea, and WALA! It was exactly the iced tea I had been wanting. It's a must-try! This tea is much too sweet, and tasted like a raspberry extract instead of tea at all. But adding Lipton to it makes it perfect."
4,Good Value!,"I think this is a great set for the money. These are my impressions of the components in the package:1) Battery - Identical to the one you receive in the package for the SD500. This will be an added bonus for days where you are taking lots of pictures without having to worry about missing any shots (unless of course your memory card is too small) because of a dead battery.2) Case - Nice to have, especially to avoid scratches on your new camera. (Although my personal opinion is this case should have been included with the camera.)3) Neck Strap - To me it is worthless, to others it may not be. I do not see myself hanging the camera from my neck. The wrist strap included with the SD500 is sufficient to hold onto the camera.Overall the set is worth the money. Just be sure to check that the battery and case sold separately are not less then this set."
3,Good for under $25,"... but DEF. not worth $40, considering that the Metal Neck Strap is barely useful. The case is great, but does not hold any accessories that you'd like to caryy most of the time (ie. SD card or extra battery). I actually found a better Lowe Pre case for $12 that holds everything. And I got an extra battery online for $12."
5,Nice product - Good price,"It is a nice case, the extra battery is very useful, and the long strap is nice to have when using the camera on the ski slopes etc. where it would be easy to drop the camera."
4,A nice and useful companion for the Canon SD camera,"My existing battery aged and I started to look forward a replacement. After I read several reviews, I preferred to choose the original one, because of heating and performance problems. Therefore, I found a good bundle price If I'd selected the cord, battery and case for my sd100 camera. By the way, I did not have a good case as this new one. I rated 4 stars, because I preferred to stay with the original cord."
4,Good camera protector.,"Although this is a good batch of accessories, the camera case itself is a little unhandy at times. It has no carry strap -- the camera strap sticks out through a slit in the top. So, if you want to carry the case by a strap and you decide to take a picture, you must open the case, pull the camera's strap through the slit, then lift the camera out. It would not keep me from buying this but it does make it unhandy."
3,"Good, Better, Best","Good for the camera case. Others have pointed out the only problem with the case it that it discolors the camera's exterior with spots which cannot be removed. (Supported by Canon's support site which confirms this but disclaims, ""Does not effect the operation of the camera."")Better is the necklace to hold the camera. Major problem is the necessity to remove the hand-carry strap, thus creating a wear it or carry it decision.Best is the battery. It takes and holds a charge as it should, and ordering in combination with the other items makes it a buy."
1,Skip this!,"The camera case only works if you wear a belt-- there is no clip on. The case itself holds only the camera, not even space for a spare battery or memory card. (I've heard the case will darken your camera, but I didn't end up using the case). The neck strap is not useful, it's too long. At '34 inches, if you're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it. (The Canon Camera rocks, however.)"
1,Does not work,"I bought this for my father for Christmas. Before you can program the voice features, you must enter a programming code to pair the device's functions to your appliance (TV, cable box, vcr, etc.) Unfortunately, none of the supplied codes worked with my father's standard Sony TV. I tried to use the code search feature--that failed as well. I took the remote home and tried it on my Hitachi TV--same problem. So, I tried to access the Invoca support web site listed in the documentation--www.invoca.net; the site does not exist. I bought this device from Brookstone--they take anything back at any time; thank goodness because I'd otherwise be out $50 for a useless piece of junk.Don't buy this item. It doesn't work as a universal remote, let alone a voice-command remote."
1,not a good choice,We got it programmed and it worked but not very good and we used it like a regular remote vs. a voice activated remote cuz you needed to yell to get it to work. 1/2 the time we lost it in the couch and it had a thing to find it but it wasn't loud enough . I would just by a regular universal remote this one is bulky and not worth it.
2,Not what I expected.,"Despite the reviews, I don't connect with this book. It had nothing memorable. Sorry, it's going to get donated to the local library."
5,so simple/so complex,Upon finishing the title story i just laid on my bed and stared at the book for a few minutes. Then I went out on the back porch to smoke a cigarette. About three or four drags later emotion gave way to physical expression and I quietly began to cry.
2,sleep inducing,"I'm not crazy about most of these short stories. But I found out I can't blame Raymond Carver after reading the cover story for the Aug. 9, 1998 ""New York Times Magazine."" That cover story shows that Carver is only vaguely the ""author"" of a lot of his stories. His editor and sometimes his wife did a great amount, and sometimes most, of the work. When the reporter was looking at the evidence of this ruse in the library that holds Carver's papers, a librarian came up to him and said, ""I stopped looking in that file when I saw what was in it."" She couldn't handle that Carver had so much ""help"" on his short stories. That's probably why he never wrote a novel. A literary Millie Vanillie, perhaps?"
3,Over-rated,"""Cathedral"" itself is a pretty good short story, but I've found most of Carver's stuff to be uneventful tedium. And Carver seemed to have never imagined anything. All his stories were just reportage from real life. Hemingway said the best of fiction is imagined. ""Cathedral"" itself actually happened. And Carver himself was a chronic liar and a con man. Scholars tend to excuse this part of Carver as something endearing. But his conning and lying bordered on sociopathy, in my opinion. I feel sorry for current and future college and high school students who are going to be force-fed Carver's dullness as part of their literary education. Read Delmore Schwartz--an unsung American short story master-- before you subject yourself to Raymond Carver."
4,Carver delivers,"""Cathedral"" was actually the first time I read a collection of Carver stories. I'd heard his name alot but don't read short stories much. Great realist storytelling about working class people facing changes/crisis/alterations in life. It made me think of my 70's childhood and the adults around me then(since I think the stories were from that period). I also recognized one of the stories from Altman's ""Short Cuts"" movie. I plan to read more Raymond Carver."
3,Good reading,"This book was highly recommended by an old friend, so I purchased it and waited anxiously for its arrival. I enjoyed reading it, but honestly was not blown away at all, however, I would still recommend it to others."
2,Bad product. Was marked by someone.,Product was mentioned as a NEW CONDITION. BUT I got a red marking (like a 5 cm line) on a side of my book. THAT IS UNacceptable.
2,Simply Stated: Overrated,"If Raymond Carver is considered one of America's greatest writers, it's no wonder the best writers are of European stock. I cannot believe garbage like this gets published. This book was a solid waste of time (I'm extremely glad I did not spend my money on it). The stories are littered with easily forgettable characters, and plots centered on nothing. Whether or not the ""nothingness"" of these stories was Carver's point, we'll never know. Also, Carver is one of the worst prose stylists I have ever read as his style is very uneven. Also, several of the stories in this collection were so short and pointless they make the others seem like grand-master works of fiction. All in all, this book is truly the epitome of art without purpose."
2,Blah...So What??,"This collection of short stories is mildly interesting and compelling at parts, but as a whole it merely provides a bland and unsurprising read. There`s really nothing special or remarkable here, since Carver presents slices of life about lonely, depressed and lost american souls who haven`t much of a life. Some moments are intriguing (the short story ""Cathedral"", for instance, about a couple and a blind man), yet the overall result fails to rise above average, dull and bleak material. Certainly overrated, this book recieved more praise than it truly deserves.A letdown."
2,over-rated,"Carver was credited with the ""revival"" in short stories in American literature. But what has happened since his ""influence""? THE NEW YORKER went from publishing often 2 stories an issue, to one story. ESQUIRE often doesn't publish any short fiction at all anymore. MADEMOISELLE stopped published short fiction ever. Maybe Carver actually killed the short story in American lit, because he bored everyone to death. When half-way through this book, you may wish you had bought a book by Raymond Chandler instead."
1,A complete waste of time,"Personally, I feel that Carver is given too much praise. This book was a waste of my money and of my time. Most say that the content in this book is too depressing if they dislike Carver, however, the focus on the bleak does not disturb me. Carver's writing style is what i find annoying. The only story that i found even worth reading in this compilation was Catherdral itself, other than that his udder lack of ""action"" (and i mean action in the sense that SOMETHING... ANYTHING... is ment to happen) i also found that the word usage itself is mundane. I recommend, to ANYONE thinking of buying this book... DON'T."
4,People Who are Down on Their Luck,"This collection of short stories are primarily about people who are down in their luck economically, emotionally or both. Many have alcohol problems. I am usually not a fan of minimalist style but it works with these stories. It is so sad that Raymond Carver died in his prime and did not get a chance to write more. His work is very important.Of this collection, my favorites are:--The Compartment--A Small Good Thing--Vitamins--Careful--Fever--CathedralAnyone who likes reading short stories will not be disappointed by this collection. Most of the stories are very good and some are even brilliant."
4,Quiet collection of riveting stories,"Carver's collection is fascinating in its simplicity. The stories are about ordinary people in ordinary situations, and yet each one grabs you because you relate to the characters. Whether looking at broken relationships, lost jobs or physical disability, Carver infuses the completely human element of vulnerability. Cathedral is an honest and plain look into the human spirit and worth a read."
4,Good Integration and Measure Into (A Bit Expensive Though),"The exposition of integration in this book is the clearest I have read. I also found the chapter on modes of convergence, where it laid out the relationship between things such as L^P-convergence and convergence in measure, to be extremely useful. The second half, where it covers topics like Lebesgue measure, repeats some of the same information from the first part which is a bit iritating if you are reading straight throught, but contains a lot of good information. The book is also quite small making it easy to take with you as a quick reference.Let me warn you though that this is an introduction to integration and measure _not_ an introduction to real analysis. It does not cover important topics like L^P-approximation, differentiation, etc. For a complete treatment of real analysis, I recommend the books ""Lebesgue Integration on Euclidean Space"" by Frank Jones and the slightly more abstract ""Real and Functional Analysis"" by Serge Lange."
5,If you are a Montessori teacher of considering being one..,"This is a must have. Read one a day, helps you through the day! Thinking about what you do and why it is so important to you!! Give it as a gift for someone in training, and just for appreciation!!"
4,Ther Tao of Montessori,I received this book as a gift and purchased multiple copies to use as gifts. Great for Montessorians.
3,The Tao of the Montessori Teacher,"This is an awesome handbook for every teacher to read. It is so inspiring to read a brief chapter and realize what educating children is really all about! I highly recommend this book for teachers and parents! Wonderful, absolutely wonderful!"
5,2 THUMBS UP....ABSOLUTE MUST-SEE!!!!,"As the first story ever told on big screen of the antecedent Vietnamese refugees to arrive in the U.S right before the official fall of Saigon, director and script writer, Timothy Linh Bui, depicts the utmost astonishing insights from these refugees' perspective of the aftermath of the Vietnam war: innumerable lives lost, both American and Vietnamese, and families' grievances; the refugees' uncertainty and fear of separation from each other in foreign land, of what the dim future could hold; the struggle with humility as even former doctors and lawyers need to adjust and start all over with lowly manual labor jobs; with hope and determination and family as the only remaining possessions they had to rebuild everything in this new, foreign land.....A movie with different insights that almost any generation or age group can relate to."
5,DVD Freen Dragon,"I'm vietnamese,so I would like to watch my people at first escape from VietNam.this film describe the way the refugees liing in refuge camp in California.The film is very interesting!You should a Vietnamese like me to feel the hapiness to come to a free country ,USA.Thank Amazon Co. sent me the excellent film that I wish to watch long time before.Thanks to seller too who kept this DVD like new(100%).Sincerely yours,Quy Vu"
5,Fantastic video!,I have used this video as a teaching aid for teaching tolerance in young people. It is well-received and the storyline provides for an historical teaching moment and an understanding of what it was like for people in the internment camps. Patrick Swayze excels as usual and Forrest Whitaker is exceptional.
3,Have to be patient,"If you watch this movie, you must be patient. I say this because their is a lot of non english speaking in the movie. Which means lots of reading of subtitles. However, their is english also spoken in the movie. The movie is a true story and is very sad and interesting. It shows how the vietemese lived a harsh life; during and after the vietname war."
1,Green Dragon,"I never understood the plot of the movie, and 90% was subtitled and the writing wasn't on the screen long enough to read. I wouldn't recommend this movie. I'm a huge Patrick Swayze fan, but this is the worst movie of his I've seen."
2,Boring a good sleeper,"Patrick Swayze worst movie ever you hardly ever seen him in the movie, Forest Whitaker scene's may been the the best thing about the movie pluse you had to read the whole movie it may been better if it wasn't in a letterbox verson i gave it a 2 star instead of one just because it was base on a real war"
5,"Detailed, not much numerical data, B&W. Some WW2 documents.","While limited to B&W pictures, and having not much numerical data on the vehicles, the book contains a VERY large and varied picture library of WW2 German tanks and antitank vehicles and guns. This includes the various 'Waffentrager' and 'Grille' series, as well as prototypes and experimental vehicles. Most of the pictures are from photos, but some are line drawings. Almost the only complaints that can be levelled at this book is that it contains few specifications and other similar numerical data, and that it was written without mentioning the ""E-series"" or 'Entwicklung' vehicles planned late in the war."
5,Great soundtrack....just can't find a few songs,"I've already bought most of the songs on iTunes, but I cannot find Cruel Summer anywhere and it's not even available on mp3 downloads on here...same with Big Love. Any suggestions? The song that goes ""We are, we are the youth of the nation"" is ""Youth of the Nation"" by P.O.D."
2,Where is Children of the Nation?????,"I purchased this CD because I thought it was a complete soundtrack! But one track is MISSING, the corus is ""We are, We are the Children of the Nation""...I do not know who did the song for the movie, I do remember it being a hit!Beuller...Beuller...Beuller? Anyone, Anyone help me find this missing track!!!!MC IN Dover NH"
5,blue crush is da' bomb!!!!!!!!,"this sound track is the bomb!!! the movie is too!! i love all the songs on this album especially ""rock star"" and ""youth of the nation"" but it is so stupid that ""youth of the nation"" is not on the soundtrack because that song is the bomb its by P.O.D by the way. anyways this soundtrack is sooooooo good and by the way you should also check into the movie both are extremly good! by the way kate bosworth is a really good actress and also by the way did i mention that this is the bomb movie!!!!!!!!???????????????????????????? by the way, bye!!!!!!!"
4,Amazing CD!,"This CD is sooo awesome. Every song on it has meaning and they all rock. The Cruel Summer remix is awesome, and so is The Doves' Firesuite. Every single song is worth listening to. I was kind of disappointed that P.O.D's Youth Of The Nation wasn't on it, because I'd heard it in the movie...overall, this is definitely a CD worth buying!"
5,Awesome,"This soundtrack is much cooler than I expected. I bought it for the Blestenation remix, which is great to dance to in the car :), but there's a whole mix of stuff on here and nearly every one is great. My particular favorites are Daybreaker by Beth Orton, the N.E.R.D. remix, Front 2 Back by Playgroup, Everybody Got Their Something by Nikka Costa, and Destiny by Zero 7. I've never really listened to much reggae, but I like what's on this album. I personally don't care for the Lenny Kravitz song, but that's pretty much my only complaint. Oh, and also that they didn't include ""Alive"" by P.O.D., which they played in the preview for the movie, on this CD - I hate when they do that :P. Otherwise, I think this is an awesome album."
4,Not bad!,"I recently bought this CD for a couple of songs in the movie that I really liked. I was very disappointed to find that one in particular was not included in this soundtrack (POD's ""Youth of the Nation"")Overall, it is a great mix of artists and songs. While it is a a soundtrack for a surfing movie, it is a far cry from the old Beach Boys or Jan & Dean genre.Nice job!"
4,a few corrections to other reviews,"Bob Marley tracks: #5 ""Big Love"" performed by Chicken and #9 credited to Damian Marley (Bob's son).Additionally, the Blestenation ""Cruel Summer"" mix does NOT feature Ace of Bass' original version because the original version of that song was performed by the 80s group Bananarama (they're even mentioned in the Blestenation lyrics) of ""Venus"" fame.I do wish the producers had arranged for POD's ""Youth of the Nation"" to be included, hence the 4 stars."
4,Unknown Song,"This was a great cd, puts you in various moods for different things, but there was one song during the make-out scene at the hotel and i cant find it, does anyone kno it?"
1,Not exactly the music in the movie!,"Blue Crush was awesome, and the music in it was awesome, so I was really disappointed when i heard the soundtrack! Do yourself a favor, and download the songs before u buy the CD to see if u actually like the music on this CD! Somehow I just enjoyed the music that was actually in the movie much better."
1,Not a good purchase,As soon as I opened the box I knew I had made a mistake. In big red letters on the side of the pedestal was a warning that this pedestal was not designed to be used in boats that would be traveling at speeds in excess of 10 miles per hour. Fortunately the return process was easy and I paid a bit more and got a much better seat pedestal.
1,Buyer Beware,"This product is listed in ""Liters,"" not pounds. This is really a eight pound bag of this excellent ""Koi"" food. The vendor doesn't see any problem with listing it in liters which, I think, is decieving. What I thought was a really great deal turned out to be an overpriced bag of fish food. This is NOT a 25 pound bag. Don't be fooled - buy it cheaper at some other site! The vendor DID offer to take it back, but only after the third back and forth message. My fault for not being more careful when I was attracted to this add. DON'T BE FOOLED..."
3,"Good buy, but Koi don't like it.",I think this product is far more economical than the brand I used before. But the three Koi in my pond do not eat it as quickly.
5,Fish love it,"The fish love it! I noticed seen I have been feeding them the food, the fish colors seen more intense."
3,Nice Necklace,"Nice Necklace, it was too thick for the barrel on the pendent I indented to use it for. So I had to return it. It could have been used alone. But I did not need another silver necklace. It would be good to give a mm comparison in the description. Other sites use the ruler to show the thickness. This would have been helpful for me."
3,"3 stars only because the Tooth ""Rock Out""","A ruined album . I'd love to own a copy of this album with Pierre Henry removed from the mix. Spooky Tooth are tight on this one but it's totally ruined by Pierre Henry's ""Music Concrete"", Luther Grosvenor really rips on this album building on his amazing work from Spooky Two."
2,The electronics ruin this recording.,"This is pretty bad. I like Spooky Tooth a lot, and I am also impressed with the religious content of the songs. However, I cannot listen to this because the electronics are totally out of context with the music and worse are mixed way out front. This may have been considered a bold experiment at the time, but it doesn't work at all. (The main reason I give it 2 stars is that the cover art is pretty cool).Get ANY of Spooky Tooth's other albums before investing in this mess."
4,The album that almost killed Spooky.,"From what I've read, Spooky Tooth's 2nd album was a hard rock masterpeice, and they were set for the big leauges. Then they put this out, and it drove them to the edge of the abyss.Ceremony may not have been the best tactical move for this band, but it is a very good album. Most of the songs stand up as hard rock, though the hard rock on here is far darker than on their first two, blues-based albums. Think of the difference between The Faces and Black Sabbath and you'll understand.The electronics can be destracting, but only becuase the songs hold up by themselves. For me, I like the 60s wierdness Pierre Henry adds to this. It is almost like you are playing two completely different albums at the same time on two turntables. The collaboration between him and the band is just so bizzare, you can't help but like it.That alone makes Ceramony worth owning."
2,A bizarre record,"Pierre Henry's electronics sound very abrasive. I like a lot of the musique concrete records from Nonesuch like Stockhausen and Xenakis, but I haven't warmed to this. I guess I was expecting things to...gell more. From a prog-rock perspective, I actually prefer both of the Electric Prunes releases more than this because the David Axelrod production is so crisp and clear. As another entry in a short-lived experimental, and somewhat lost era of rock, perhaps it is worth another listen."
5,One of the very few true rock applications to classic genres,"'Ceremony, An Electronic Mass' may be one of the very few classic Rock works where the rock idiom in its (relatively) pure form is applied to a classical genre, the Mass. There are some well-meaning but weak attempts, as with the Electric Prunes attempt which simply does classical phrasings with rock instruments. I hope to do a much more thorough review of this work soon, but I'm moved to put in my two cents quickly, as I misstated the title of this album in my review of 'Tommy', one of the other very few genuine translations of classic genre into the rock idiom.I would say this about few albums, but this work demands your attention simply because of its great ambitions to accomplish a difficult task. Even if you don't believe the composers succeeded (I think they did) it is important to listen to and be aware of this important signpost in the history of Rock."
3,'Spooky' is right!,"This is the only lp I ever owned by this band. I must admit, I was disappointed with it. If it were not for the added effects by Pierre Henry, it would have been a good piece of music. I liked the idea of setting a set of hymns to rock, but it was a little too gloomy from what I recall when I first got it in 1970. Maybe I would appreciate it more now. I regret trading it in for cash but maybe I will obtain another copy."
4,Summer of '76,"The comparisions to ""Summer of '42"" are inevitable. But aside from the coming of age story of both films, they are completely different. The ""Inkwell"" is essentially a Shaggy Dog tale that flows nicely from beginning to end. Give credit for Matty Rich's abililty to create an authentic '70's atmoshphere with the use of very little of that era's well known music (""Dancing Machine"" and ""Let's Get It On"" are the only two). ..."
5,teen years,"I saw myself in this movie in so many parts. That I thought it was my life story. This is my second time purchasing this movie, from the music to the underline story behind the story. Just about everyone had that stuff animal when they was growing that had to let go of. Till this day I still have mine, it was more then a stuff animal but a friend. The life changing events in this movie is a coming of age movie about a boy that had a traget experince and learning to date."
4,The Inkwell,"One of my favorite movies. The case and disc, was in mint condition. I love Lorenz Tate. Its definitely worth the price."
1,fake bustas,"I don't know what beach manny rich went to, but if I perved on the females dressed like Greg Brady talking to an ugly doll...yo, I'd suffa a serious beat down! keep it real"
1,it did not work,"i love this movie and bought it so that I cold retire my VHS copy. unfortunately, it does not work in my DVD i am i the process of returning it"
5,DVD Review,The DVD was shipped promptly after payment and arrived intact. It is a great addition to my collection.
2,Good Movie Sidelined by Stupidity,"What could have been a wonderful coming-of-age film dealing with many issues (relationships, conflicts, growing boys, disappointment, psychology, etc.) was absolutely sidelined by the unsuccessful attempts at over-the-top humor. Never have I seen adolescent boys behave the way the group were portrayed. It was simply another Fat Albert-style farcical attempt to make the boys and feuding brothers-in-law appear utterly ridiculous. The director/producers didn't know whether to make an outrageous comedy or a drama with moments of good humor. Regrettably, they made neither.Such a shame, because many moments in this film were truly enlightening and poignant. This could have been a tremendous drama! A remake done correctly would be wonderful!"
2,"Not bad period flavor, but YECHHH!","Being that I was 12 during the Summer of 1976 when this film took place, I'll agree that they got some of the period flavor of the era correct (outrageously fake afros aside), but this movie stinks to high heaven as a whole. Not only for the atrocious acting and meandering story, but for the ending with the father (Glynn Turman)congratulating his young teenaged son for bedding down a GROWN MARRIED WOMAN!? What kind of MESS is that to show in this day and age? This one needs to be outta here like ""London After Midnight!"""
5,An Excellent Film,"Every once in a while, I come across a movie that jerks me out of my normal hollywood funk (""hollywood funk""-the effects of watching various movies with virtually the same storyline repeatedly as if the plots were recycled for long periods of time) and reminds me what movies can be if enough thought, creativity, acting, care, and other special qualities are poured into the film. ""The Penitent Man"" is one of those movies and and it's a relief because it's been a long, funky, dry spell.The movie has no special effects. It has no explosions or car chases or stunts of any kind. What this movie does have is superb acting (highlighted in this category is Lance Henrikson as he was in top form), strong scenes, creativity, and a great amount of story and imagination.I won't give anything away but you should give it a little over a half an hour. If you don't like it by then, well...you'll know by then. I strongly recommend this film for whatever my recommendation is worth."
3,Writer needs to read more,"The story starts out with delicious, tantalyzing indicators that it is going to be one of those excellent little independant films that comes along occasionally and threatens to tell us big truths.But the threat is never made good on because the writer (direct, producer, Nicholas Gyeney) hasn't gone far enough in his thinking to take us anywhere.Lance Henrikson is the one bright spot, making his character and the story believable as long as he is talking, and showing real depth and nuance.Lathrop Walker, local Seattle actor, just doesn't have enough of a character to work with and ends ups being whiney and sad....and, well... whiney.I hope this writer takes this up again in a few years. I have a feeling he does have a story to deliver when he puts the pieces together."
1,What was the point,"I picked up this book for my daughter because we are not far from Johnstown and wanted to learn more about this time in history. It was an easy read. It gave insight into family life at that point in time. But what I objected to is the blaming of 'those millionaires from Pittsburgh' for shaving off the top of the damn. There is another reference to ""It's all the fault of the greedy rich"". What was the point of blaming the rich? If the people at the time saw some objectionable practices, like lowering the height of the damn or the removing of the drainage pipes, why did they not speak up? Nothing like a broad generalization to start the wealth envy in the young. I would not recommend this book."
5,Outstandingly Resourceful!,"this book is very precise and chronologically correct. each chapter leads to the next covering nearly every aspect of the artist/songwriter-end of the music industry. i especially liked the sparatic quotes from interviews with successful artists, A&Rs, CEOs, publishers and producers in the industry. don't buy this book if you're looking for an easy way to land a deal, but do buy it if you are willing to work at advancing your music career and would like a practical guide to give you an advantage over the competition. i highly recommend this book, it's a must-read for anyone that desires to MAKE MONEY with their music and aquire basic knowledge about the music industry including what common mistakes to avoid straight from the mouths of industry big-wigs."
2,There is more to it than this.,"If only getting a record deal were so easy. A lot of the info here works great in theory, but not in practice. I recommend something by somebody who actually works in the industry rather than just writes books about it."
2,I'm hoping for an expanded second edition....,"I ordered this book based on the other review here onamazon.com and was looking for a bit more. A fair bit of the contentis already covered by free application notes on the web and sales literature that the makers of DMA instrumentation pass out for free. If your looking for a solid treatment of the polymer physics of DMA testing, that's not this book; maybe it hasn't been written yet. If you just want to relate DMA testing to real world environments and effects, then there aren't enough good examples in the book or a method to make this book worth the price.This would make an acceptable guide for a technician who was just introduced to a DMA - I was looking for more."
5,Some of the greatest Down Home American music ever recorded,Read all the other reviews of this timeless record then stop wasting time and order it. My original copy saw so much play it sounds like a waterfall. This record blends clever hooks with traditional Appalacian Bluegrass to create the first true Cross-Over piece of its genre. The fine tuned harmonies and sense of musical joy delivered on this record leave you with a lasting smile. Enjoy...
4,This was a very good book,"I liked this book, I am very interested in these things, but I really would have liked to learn more about HOW they find the planets, for this was not really explained in detail."
5,"Excellent, detailed, informative and a good read.","Ken Croswell's book, ""Planet Quest"" is a must for anyone interested in the search for planets outside of the solar system. The book reads well, telling a fascinating story from the beginnings of speculation about the existence of alien worlds right up to the present when information is coming to us all the time about strange new worlds around distant stars. Anybody with an interest in the possibilities of life elsewhere must read this book."
4,Cute and fun,"The dragon is exactly as pictured. I had no trouble mastering the mechanism, the only issue is as stated elsewhere, the mouth does not close completely so, it takes away from the realism a little, but overall, a great fun puppet and a worthwhile purchase."
4,Dragon shoulder puppet,"I'm a great lover of dragons, and a director of a church puppetry group, so this item intrigued me. It is quite a complex puppet for what I will call a toy-grade puppet, and the kids all love it. Ventriloquism skills are definitely needed to give it a personality. The controls are a bit awkward and are definitely made for someone smaller than the average adult, but are not difficult to work. My only complaint is that the dragon's mouth does not fully close, which makes mouth movements somewhat unrealistic. It's a great, fun toy, though!"
3,Hoover Through Friendly Eyes,"Herbert Hoover: The Man and His WorkThis contemporary view by a man who worked for Hoover in the distribution of food to starving millions in Europe during and after World War I is neither balanced nor critical, but it gives a detailed close-up of Hoover's executive style in successfully completing that amazing task. The early sections cover Hoover's childhood, college years, and professional career as the leading mining engineer of his day."
5,Front Floor liners work well,Liners fit the front area well and are tall enough to protect carpet area. No Problems and easy to clean!
4,Great looking. Solid construction.,"Not much to say really. These bags are very sturdy and have a great feel. The stitching and construction is heavy and seems like it will last forever.I've seen other cheaper bags, but they didn't really compare to the Eco Bags.If you need some canvas bags, these are the ones to get."
5,"Great bag, great price","The Eco Bag is great. I gave them out as Christmas gifts, everyone liked them. Very roomy."
3,canvas totes,"Nice canvas bags, although they shrunk up a lot after the first wash. But they are durable and a still a good size for groceries."
4,"same thing, cheaper at walmart","This same item is at walmart.com for $13.97. Seriously, these people are overpricing this like crazy. It should be a crime!"
2,Spiderman Lamp,"I was disappointed with this one. I was expecting it to be bigger, and stand up by itself. The weight of the cord pulls it over if it's not ""balanced"". Had it been bigger and stood up, it would've been perfect. My 4 year old still loves it."
4,Great product but it looked used before,We received this product and it had some plastic pieces that were broken plus the load bars had scratches on them. It was obvious that someone had used it before. With that said we kept it because frankly its a roof rack and we didn't need it to be pretty. The functionality is great. Being able to remove the load bars with a push of two buttons is extremely useful. We were also happy that we could get a cargo box PLUS our tandem bike rack on this rack at the same time. You of course need to get the right cargo box to make that work. Would have gave it 5 stars if the product actually came new like advertised.
2,Not a bargain,"There is a 7-piece set (includes a lid for that stock pot) with a 10' fry pan at Macy's for the exact same price ($419). It gets 2 stars because it's still All-Clad quality, but this isn't worth your money."
2,Misleading description,"I was searching for a music disk, these disks maybe historically accurate, but they are not like , Joan Shenandoah's disks. I bought two, and listened to both of them twice. Now they are stored on a back shelf.I have listened to Spirit several times."
5,I bought five copies of this book,"I liked this book when I first read it so I bought five copies of it to give to friends to read. It confused everyone, because my name is Ira Spector too-although I was not the author of this wonderfully crafted novel. the genius of this book is how well Ira blendselementary human survival and the technical world of today in this intriguing tale. Although first published in 1999, it reads like itwas hot off the press today. Christmas is coming, and I just might buy five more copies."
3,smells like fish and pineapples,"it works great as a conditioner, but i can't stand the smell. i thought i was the only one having this problem. but seriously, if you want your hair to smell like fish and pineapples, then this product is for you."
4,A Big Bargain,My wife got hooked on this when she was exposed to it at her hair salon. Amazon's price is simply superior.
3,Can't stand the smell,"I like the product ok, but did I get a bad batch? It smells like rotten fruit. Wish it smelled better."
5,Very good hair conditioner.,Very good contitioner especially when used with the TIGI shampoo. Local prices are very high. In this size it is a very good price and well worth the price. That is why I orderer 2 of them.
4,Pace Rework Station,"I believe this product to be good. I am not the end user but just the purchaser. Since it hasn't been returned, it must be working just fine."
5,Good bargain edition for Kindle,"I must say, I don't share Judge's disappointment with this edition for the Kindle. Granted, if you want the book for reference purposes, then the lack of a linked subject index is a major flaw. However, if (like me) you simply want to read Madison's Convention journal, this edition is perfectly fine.This edition has very few typos and is appropriately formatted. It has a linked table of contents that enables you to jump to each day of the Convention. And the price is more than fair."
1,An unindexed bunch of pages.,"The convention lasted several months in 1787. This should be indexed by day. While the editors created index links, all of the links point to page 1. By using a Kindle, I sacrifice the ability to scan pages. the trade-off is usually a good index. Not in this title. Hence, a worthless sheaf of pages."
4,Seatrain,"Great music, saw them in 72. But cd is hard to find. If it's not available here, try Ebay, copies of this and Marblehead Msg are common."
5,Seatrain,"I am looking for the Seatrain CD also! Did anybody have any luck, we must be able to get it... Please Email me if you have any info. on how we can get it too.Karen55938@cs.com"
4,This is the real deal!,"Just to confirm...I received this CD and it really is the original first recording of SeaTrain on A&M in 1969(re-issued on Edsel). And I have been looking for this for 28 years! Correction to my earlier review: The first record by this band lineup (a spinoff of the great East Coast band, The Blues Project) was issued on Verve, not A&M. But this was their first record as SeaTrain. None of the SeaTrain records after this one are actually the same lineup, (Richard Green carried on)nor do they come close to this one."
4,This is an excellent cd from the spinoff of Seatrain.,"Seatrain was a great compilation group in the 1970's featuuring Richard Greene on fiddle and Andy Kulberg on flute. Capitol stopped producing the original title (I'm Willin, 13 Questions, Out Where the Wind Blows etc) which was then produced by One Way Records. It doesn't seem to exist anywwhere. If anyone knows where I can get a copy please, please e-mail me at mslater612 @aol.com. Thanks. For those of us who know and love Seatrain you know why I am so anxious to find a copy of the original CD."
5,Looking for CD,"I still have the Seatrain LP (I'm Willing, Song of Job, Waiting for Elijah, etc) and it's in pretty good shape considering! I listen to it on a regular basis and my kids have fallen for it too. Does anyone know where (or if) a CD version is available?"
4,Sea Train SEA TRAIN (not the George Martin one),"I'm really glad to see other people appreciate this brilliant debut album by Sea Train--it should be released as a twofer with Blues Project PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE, which contained the same band members. I agree with the sentiment that called it was one of the greatest non-classical rock records ever (relevant because of the album's baroque stylings and virtuoso musicianship) and also one of the geekiest yet strangely moving records ever. From the time when experimental bands could still get signed...terrific violin and guitar, truly adventurous arrangements, musically all over the map, sounds like no one else and yes, it rocks too. Most of the music appears to have been written by Andy Kulberg, the flute player! I even dig the effete vocals, which fit nicely. Not to be confused with Sea Train SAME produced by George Martin which aims for a similar ecleticism but doesn't have the songs this one does...."
4,still relevant 5 years later,"The book was written at the end of the dot com era, perhaps as a reaction against the intense high-tech stress undergone by many people. It is now 5 years later, but the text is still relevant. After all, while the dot com era is now clearly seen as overly inflated, the technology did not go away after the crash. In fact, it has continued to improve, and no doubt the stress levels are still present for many people.So the book's advice about maintaining a balance between your professional and social lives is very germane. It is also worth keeping in mind, when, and not if, another cycle of high technology frenzy spins up."
4,Quintessential Gladiators Compilation,"This is a phenomonal collection of the Gladiators in one place. It is missing some of my favorites, but you need to get deep into old LPs to really get their greats (""On the Other Side of the Mountain""). I think the real gem of this album is ""Tribulation."" Haunting and euphoric. This album made me dig a lot deeper into Gladiator roots and I will always cherish it for that."
3,gladiators,not a bad album.the one to get is virgins frontline. DREADLOCKS THE TIME IS NOW a seriously wicked album
3,Good mix of songs from one of reggae's enduring artists,"I'm not going to pretend that I was around when the Gladiators made their debut, so I have no idea how ground-breaking or revolutionary this music was. What I DO know is that it's damn good roots reggae that's easy to listen to.Albert Griffiths and the Gladiators have a nice sound, reminiscent of the way Bob and the Wailers sounded in the beginning of their careers. Several voices singing at once, in simple, effective harmonies. But the band incorporates a lot of sounds indicative of later, rock-steady reggae. It's a good sound, amplified by some of reggae's hey-day producers.My favorite songs have to be ""Roots Natty,"" ""Watch Out,"" and ""Mr. Sweet."" All the songs but one found on ""Studio 1"" have never been released on CD before, so this will be an interesting introduction to the Gladiators for those who've never heard of them, and a welcome treasury for those who have."
5,Delightful!,"Accompany Christopher Robin through the Hundred-Acre-Wood as he gives ""colorful"" treats to each of his friends. This sweet little board book teaches colors while capturing babies attention with a delightfully rhythmic beat, ""A GREEN one for Rabbit, a RED one for Pooh, an ORANGE one for Tigger, and YELLOW one, too!,"" and so on. Additional colors include: purple, pink, brown, blue, gold, gray, black, and white. The illustrations are charming and appeal to young children. ""Colors"", is a charming book with simple images for easy comprehension. Birth and up."
3,Gray lollipops?,"Cute book, cute rhymes, cute illustrations. The concept is even cute - Christopher Robin sharing lollipops with all of his friends. But the part that has me baffled is the page for the color gray. ""Christopher Robin likes gray ones the best,"" and there's our pal Chris holding up a delicious gray lollipop. For real? What flavor is a gray lollipop supposed to be? Soot?I don't get what the editors were thinking here. It's an otherwise fine book, and my son loves it, but gray lollipops? Yuck."
3,A Misnamed Book,"If this book had been named 'The Invention of Heterosexuality in the United States', it would probably be worth 5 stars. Great book, but not sufficiently up-front about its limited scope. Anyone looking for a broad-ranging history of homophobia and its causes would do better with Greenberg's 'The Construction of Homosexuality'. Anyone interested in an American perspective should buy Katz. (I am American, so it's not a matter of anti-Americanism; I simply didn't find what I was looking for with Katz.)"
2,"Wonderful interview, yet a little boring...","Natalie shows enthusiasm about the interview. Discussing her 10,000 Maniacs career, it is a little troublesome to understand her words. Some information is great, some is dull. I am a true fan of hers, but this album just didn't make me happy."
4,the climax,my great grandfather wrote the book. My sister is reading it and says it's good and uplifting. I haven't had a chance to read it yet
2,1/4 Sheet Pans- I didn't realize,"For their size they are very nice - even though it stated it in the title, I was unaware of how small they were."
3,Glo Care Bear,"I bought 2 this year, one for my grand daughter and one for my child from the Giving Tree. After watching my grand-daughter (3 1/2) with this one, I would say it is definitely for younger children - this is one she played with for about 5 minutes and was done with. Although Care Bears are great, I definitely recommend this for a younger child."
4,Works great - wish they made an unscented version,Works great removing stains from carpet. Agree with past review that the smell is overwhelming when applied. Odor seems to dissipate once it dries. The company should consider making an unscented version.
3,fresh and clean odor and stain eliminator,I bought this because I inherited a dog that is not fully house trained. I really don't like the smell of it. I had to open up the window to air out the room. I used it on the carpet. It is fairly good but not a great product as claimed.
1,It smells like Fabreze.,"The original formula was wonderful and really worked well. . . . this new formula smells like Fabreze and is very strong. If I wanted Fabreze, I would have bought Fabreze! I don't like it at all!"
5,Great Stuff!,This stuff takes away stains and leaves a clean smell behind. I like this product far more than any other product I've tried.
3,Boost accessory,Item didn't make any difference in signal strength or quality for my use. Older devices may be useful for this device but not newer ones.
5,reef sandles,"all was great, although i thought the shiping was to much, other then that, it was all good."
1,defective,"The pair I ordered was defective and I had to return them. The strap was placed to far back on the shoe bed, so it didn't fit the contour of my foot correctly. I've since purchased this shoe elsewhere and I'm very happy with it."
5,AMAZING FLIP FLOPS!!,"These shoes are pretty much the most comfortable flip flops I've ever worn (I collect flip flops-my collection has over 20). They have amazing arch support, and tends to run a tad bit skinny on the straps, so if your feet are a little wider, you may want to size up."
1,Suspicious these aren't real,"I've owned at least half a dozen pairs of these sandals over the years. Typically they are excellent. These, however, were much more flimsy and cheaper than my older pairs, and the bottom tread looks completely different compared to my others. They are also too small, even though I've always worn the size I ordered. Either Reef has gone incredibly down hill, or these are fake shoes."
2,metallic colors don't work,The comfort of reef sandals are great -- i have owned several pairs but the metallic colors are plain ugly. oxy-moronic styling in a beach flip-flop. Amazon's color selection is very limited -- these metallic colors and all black are the only choice. Reef has lots of additional colors -- would be great to see them offered on amazon.
5,not bad!,"I thought the straps on this would bother me after parting with my old leather-strapped Reefs, which are no longer sold. I bought these along with a newer version of leather straps, and I favor these, surprisingly. I love them, and haven't had any problems with them yet!"
2,Not for small feet,The big toe divider on these flip-flops were much too long for my small feet and I couldn't keep them on my feet. I returned them. I also didn't like the curved sole---which made walking harder.
3,Straps get twisted,"The sandals are cushy enough and seem sturdy, but the straps get twisted every time I put them on and if I don't take the time to straighten them out it makes it uncomfortable to walk. I've never had this problem with a pair of flip flops. Maybe the straps are too thin."
5,Perfection! Great Investment.,"After 12 years(!!) of enjoying the comfort of my previous pair of brown Reef flip flops it was time for another purchase. You really can't go wrong. They are plain brown and will go with anything, they offer SO much comfort and won't bother your feet...ever, and they are durable. I put my other Reefs through the ringer--they've been through a LOT. I feel as though the quality of my new pair is just as great.YAY. Do it. Buy a pair. You won't regret it."
4,pretty good flip flops,"I really like these flip flops, but when I walk in them they make a lot of noise. The flip flop noise if you know what I mean! They are the loudest flip flops I have ever owned. When I walk I try to hold them closer to my foot (so they won't be so loud), but it does not seem to work. Other than that, it did take alittle while to get use to the arch support. I have only ever had flat flip flops. I'm not sure if they are the best for walking long distances which is what I wanted. But basically they are comfortable and look nice."
5,"great, cute flip-flops",this is my second pair of Reef Ginger flip flops. The first pair lasted two summers with almost daily wear. They're squishy and super comfortable and have a little arch support that justifies them being a little more expensive.
2,Straps are floppy,"I bought these flip flops to wear at the health club pool. It appeared from the picture that the straps were stiff so I could slip them off and on easily. They aren't. The 'thong' straps are fabric and they flop so that you have to use your fingers to situate the straps on your foot. Be fine if I was wearing them all day, but I'm putting them on and taking them off and it's annoying, especially when your feet are wet."
5,Great flip flops,This is my third pair of Ginger's over several years and I love them. They are soft and comfy and wear extremely well even when getting wet a lot.
5,My favorite black flip flops!,"I love love these Reef Ginger flip flops! I already have a pair but I wanted to order another as a back up pair. This is my 3rd pair and they are my go to comfortable cute black flip flops! I'm a 6 1/2 in normal shoes and I take a 7 in these and they fit perfect! Definitely recommend these to anyone looking for comfortable, cute, black flip flops!"
2,ginger reef sandals,The product is great; but I got sent the wrong color. It was listed as black/blue and turned out to be black/purple and shiny silver. Someone must be color blind.
5,Favorite flip flops!,"I love to wear flip flops, but since beginning my career as a teacher, I've had to switch to ""normal"" shoes. I will say this is the only pair of flip flops I can wear without having major foot pain at the end of the day. They've held up well over a long period of time, and they come in a variety of colors (I personally own 3 different colors). They are my favorite pair of flip flops and I'm considering buying a spare pair of black ones in case they ever get worn out."
3,sandals,"umm..these sandals are comfortable but kind of big..I selected the right size but it was kind of big..but it's not too bad. overall, good quality and comfortable :)"
5,Reef Rocks!,"My Reef sandals really ROCK! They're cool, comfortable, affordable and most importantly, they do NOT hurt my feet. I'd never been able to wear 'flip-flops' because I would inevitably have to change shoes after a few minutes. The design and workmanship of Reef make them the only flip-flop/sandals I can wear for hours on end and never be uncomfortable. I highly recommend them and will be purchasing more in the future!"
3,Not up to Reef's standards,"These flip flops are not the same as the Reef GINGER flip flops I bought a couple years ago and still use. There is not as much arch support as my old pair and they feel kind of like cheap styrofoam soles. I'm still going to wear them, but if you are buying these to replace an older pair... they are not the same. On the positive, they are true to size. I wear a size 8 and they fit."
5,"Affordable, wearable and durable! Love it!","Better than your typical flip-flop! The sandal gets better over time as the foam bottom conforms to the shape of your foot to give you better support than a flat bottomed flip flop. I also will only buy sandals with cloth straps because it won't chafe my foot and give me horrible blisters. If you're like me and not willing to shell out $40+ for a pair of Rainbows, these are definitely a great alternative. I've been wearing mine for over a year!"
3,Not as great as Reefs bought in the past.,"I normally love Reef sandals but these are different than sandals I have bought from them in the past few years. I held these up to last year's sandals and the same size has about a half inch trimmed off all the way around. Sure, my foot still fits on the shoe but just barely. I should have returned them but I was hoping I could make them work. I don't think I will ever wear them in public because it looks like I can't afford to buy shoes that fit. I'm really disappointed with this change in their sandals."
5,favorite,these are my favorite flip flops of all time. i always make sure I have at least one pair. They are so comfortable.
5,My favorite!,I love the way they mold to my foot shape. They are so comfortable. The color selection is very extensive.
3,Could be ok but ...,"I purchased these looking for something with arch support. I hate wearing shoes in the summer, but need to have good support to keep my plantars fasciitis in check. These do have good arch support, but the shoe itself is not wide. Seems like it is made for very narrow feet. I also think they were a bit expensive for a basic pair of flip flops."
4,cute and comfy,Nice little arch support -- firm enough to do some good & last a while. The thong is just a little short for me -- hoping wearing them little by little will stretch the thong & squish down the sole just enough to be perfect.
1,"Not the Reef quality I expected, don't fit either","Ordered these for my daughter. She normally wears 7 1/2 - 8 Medium width. I ordered 8M for her. When she got these they were smaller than any of her 7 1/2 sandles and MUCH narrower. Totally unusable. Marking on the back was US 8. NOT! Also the quality, look, and feel was on par with the $3.99 stuff you see in Walmart, et al. Not worth the trouble of returning. Amazon...I trusted you and you let me down!!! Amazon should screen their suppliers better, are they trying to grow too fast??? Reef - you need to watch your quality better - don't lose your image just trying to make your quartlerly numbers. BTW - the label said ""made in Indonesia""."
4,they do it again,"for all those who love the detroit cobras this album is terriffic. i picked up for import price without giving it a second thought, i had to have this album after hearing the two previous releases. this album doesn't dissapoint at all. life love and leaving will probably always be my favorite, but baby is well worth the money."
5,Just great rock n roll,"I happened to be at borders listening to some cd's and I saw this one and thought the cover was interesting, so I decided to try it and was blown away. These guys are great. Just great retro garage rock n roll all the way, they can play and rachel nagy is one of my new favorite singers. She can sing, is warm, but sultry and very inviting. I play the cd almost everyday and havent tired of it. I will anxious to hear their other cd's. GO, DETROIT COBRAS."
1,piece of junk,metal used is too thin and can bend easily. one of the rivets that fastens the handle to the blade is loose making the scissors wobbly. i chose this one over the others because it's a product of singer but i guess sometimes you can't rely on a name. i am greatly disappointed.
5,"useful, small, and sturdy",I got these scissors to put on my keychain and they come in handy all the time. When im out and about I dont carry a lot on me so these scissors are convienent.
3,Not Really what I wanted,"I have owned the very best of this is acid jazz 1 for years now and LOVE it! So I figured I would buy the 2nd one.It has to be good,right? wrong.This is way too much influenced by techno and hip-hop.Also,seems to be very repetitive as well.Keep saying the same things over and over again.Can you tell I didnt enjoy this very much? Buy the first one.MUCH better."
2,"New, but not new!","Unfortunately, what the description above does not include about this book is that it is a reprint of a book originally published in 1898! Nice print job, if you want to read history, but I was looking for something on the current state government."
4,Great gift,"I bought this for my step father as a Christmas gift kind of a what do you get someone that has everything gift. Well, he has probably 40 -50 watches and thought this would be a good start. I ordered it a little late, but when i gave it to him he was very happy. As a matter of fact he commented just the other day how happy he was when he opened it & saw what it was. He could of bought it for himself but never thought about it. It holds large watches well & is weell constructed"
4,Mr. Nice Watch,"Very nice construction; plenty of room to hold larger watches. Overall, a quality product that I would recommend. the pillows for the watches are nicely done as well."
4,Great storage watch box!,"Very nice cost/benefit item, beautiful and functional, its a nice way to have all your watches stored in the same place in an elegant and fancy way, without paying more for this! Really soft and fine interior. I really recommed it! I've would have given 5 stars if it was real leather... but, looks great anyway!"
1,Complete garbage - DO NOT BUY!,"Was very excited when I found this product and even more excited after reading the reviews.You can imagine my disapointment when I opened the box. For starters, the case is not leather like the descripton leads you to believe. It is a composite blend, that does not feel, smell nor look like real leather. In fact, one of corners was pealing up confirming the leather is not genuine.The look inside is not bad. I was pleased with that, but upon further inspection (like another review), the interior material is cheap as well. Also, the latch does not line up so of course the ability to use the lock and key is missing.The description states ""Handcrafted"" and ""holds 10 of your finest watches"". Well my fine Tag's and Rolex's will never see the inside of this. Do youself a favor skip this case. I will be returning immediatly."
2,leather watchbox,The description says the exterior is leather but it looks like plastic. Glued plastic. The interior is not exceptional but passable. Very dissatisfied.
2,The author who could not present himself as an observer,the author could have come out of cantonment sentiment and describe - what he has - in more detail that why bengalis felt the way they had and then it would have been complete.
5,Three Fine Comedies and One Odd Misfire,"This volume contains some of Sturges' best work, including the immortal comedy The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, together with The Palm Beach Story and Unfaithfully Yours. Five stars for The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, perhaps the funniest, most subversive movie of the 1940's.The biggest curiosity here, though, is Sturges' script for his odd dental-anesthesia biopic The Great Moment. This film was heavily altered by the studio prior to its release. Sturges' original script would probably have been a better picture, but it's hard to imagine this project succeeding in any case."
4,4 1/2 stars---great unknown melodic rock,"I bought this album simply because I LOVED Velocity's ""Impact"" so much. While this early '90s collection isn't quite as rocking, it is still a melodic pop/rock gem. ""Getaway Machine"" is a great start to the album and just screams Rick Springfield at his best. ""To The Top"" is a fantastic mid-tempo rocker, and the title track has a gorgeous laid back feel to it. ""One Minute To Midnight"" is also on the Velocity album--the version here is also great. ""Summer Rules"" is a great song to close the album. All in all, this collection is definitely a worthwhile purchase for fans of Rick Springfield or Velocity--or melodic rock fans in general. Definitely a quality melodic rock listen."
1,way overrated,"Ophiel is way overrated. Ok maybe its just me, his writing style is so chatty. Just get to the point. I forced myself to read the book all the way through. Good Glorious I still don't know what he was talking about. If you want a good book on visualizing start with The Silva Method. This book was wack"
4,tireless fun for about $10,"My then 6 month old son got this for Christmas and now at a year old is still entertained by this toy. He loves the way it lights up and is very pleased with himself when he gets it to play a song. In the 6 months we've had this toy, with constant use, I have only had to replace the batteries once. It is also not too annoyingly loud, although there is not adjustable volume."
2,Wish I had bought a cheaper version of this classic toy,"I like a ring-stacking toy to assist in the development of eye-hand coordination of my little one. I chose to purchase this musical version since my son seems to love hearing songs and tunes. However, because of the design, the only sounds that my son hears are of those similar to those produced by a slot machine when the handle is pulled. My husband and I frequently comment how we are reminded of a casino when our son is playing with this toy. If we want him to hear the tunes, we have to push the correct button for him.Therefore, I wish I would have just bought the classic ring stacking toy, and used the savings to purchase an additional album with music for my son to listen to."
2,fragile,"It was fun while it lasted. It has tiny light bulbs that are not child resistant. The second time my son dropped it, they all broke."
2,Used Item,"We really love the toy but I am very disappointed that we bought a new toy, paid full price and it came to us clearly used.... the package was taped back together and there are scratches on it... i should have just went to the store and bought it.."
4,Long Lasting Fun,"My daughter is currently 15 months old and loves this toy. She has been playing with it since she was 6 months old and it has always been a favorite. She started out chewing on the stars and smacking the pole to make the lights come on. Now she actually stacks the stars. Great toy that will have a long life. My only criticism is that I wish it had an off switch for the sound. The sounds aren't too annoying, but anything for a long period of time can be a little much."
2,Strangely scary,"I bought this toy for my granddaughter and she loved it while it was still in the box. The first time I took it out of the box and she heard the music, she cried (age 6 months). I thought it was a fluke so I put the toy away. I gave it to her a month later and the same thing happened. I also tried it last week (she's 8 months old today) and she still cried. I cannot explain this because she has several other Fisher-Price musical toys that she loves. Maybe, some day, she'll enjoy it.Edit: At 11 months, this toy became one of her favorites. She now plays with every part of the toy and constantly finds new creative ways to play with it."
3,Cute but a little disappointed,This toy is entertaining because of the lights and music. I was a little disappointed that the center post is one continuous size so the rings can be put on in any order. I think that kind of defeats the purpose of a ring stacker since it doesn't teach stacking them by size order.
1,Bad idea,"This toy makes no sense. As a ring stacker, why all the bells and whistles. Also the yellow star on the top? What's up with that? All is needed are the rings and the stacking poll. The yellow star does not even stay on, and keeps falling off the top of the stacking poll. Shame on you Fisher-Price! The person in your company that came up with this idea should be demoted to cleaning the bathrooms."
3,Battery life in this toy doesn't last too long,Got this for my son as I thought he'd enjoy it. I think he plays with the other stacker more (and that one is super cheap and no frills). Noticed the batteries do not last very long. It could be because the lights are very flashy and use up a lot of energy each time a star is removed or the top is pushed down. It is cute though.
5,One of Tyler's favorite toys!!,"We bought this toy for our baby's first Christmas, and he is over 2 now, and still loves it. He likes to take the stars off, and play the music. We call it his music stick, which he carries allllll over the house spinning to the music until he falls. The lights just make it even better to him. A great toy, not too expensive toy."
2,Broke Within 6 months,"My son especially liked playing the tunes by pushing the top button on the stacker, and I liked the toy too--until it suddenly died. He hadn't been rough with it or anything, and we tried changing the batteries and everything, to no avail."
2,Love the lights but Hard to get rings on and off...,I was excited to get this for my little boy cause he LOVES lights and music. My husband wanted to get the plain jane stacker like what we had when we were kids but I had to get this one. I wish I would have listened to him. This is great to catch my sons attention however it doesnt serve its purpose. The rings are hard to get on and off because there is a button on the side when you put the rings on make it lightup. I have a hard time putting them on sometimes so you can imagin how diffucult it is for my 8month old. If I hadnt destroyed the box when I opened this toy it would have went back.
2,Impossible to Actually Stack,"This toy looks great and seems like a new twist on an old classic. However, its functionality is severely diminished by the fact that the little button at the top that triggers the music makes it extremely difficult for an infant to stack. It's a big problem with this toy, especially when you consider that the thing is billed as a ""stacker"" but doesn't function well at all in that regard. My 10-month-old can pull the rings off until it gets to the button, where it gets stuck. Same principle for putting them back on, they get stuck at the very top. I now realize we would have been better off getting the old school stacker, since it actually allows a child to stack."
3,Two stars don't slide easily on and off the yellow pole,"Baby loves playing with the stars but when it comes to stacking them on the yellow pole, 2 of them are resistant. As for removing them off the pole, they don't slide easily up, actually the whole yellow pole comes off the floor when I try to remove 2 of the stars, I have to put one hand on the pole base to be able to remove them, imagine how hard a baby has to pull !!!"
4,7 month old baby girl,It was fun my daughter like playing w/ the rings and they are also fun fo the bathtub their really good chewing toy for those babies who are theeting. Overall I liked it she plays w/ every toy on it seperately she doesn't play with it the way its suppose unless I do it for her and it keeps her entertained for the most part. It was a good buy and I would recommend to a friend.
4,"This toy is great, but...","The battery life ends quickly.( Other than that, it's really quite durable) If they lasted a bit longer, I would have been inclined to give it a 5 as it is one of the most adored toys in the nursery. It's one of about 3 or 4 other items that my 19 month old son will play with for more than 5 seconds, and for that, it's gotta be good! I would recommend this toy as we are overall pleased with it."
5,my son still loves this,My son is 15 months and he still loves this toy. He has now learned how to put the stars back on and is so proud of himself. I would recommend this to anyone.
4,very bright and musical,"my son got this toy for christmas last year and it is still one that he plays with, but just the base the stars are at the bottom of the toy box. he figured out that if he just pressedthe bottons on the base thelight as music would play. he loves to use it as a hammer. i suppose yo would call it a god toy being that he plays with at least part of it a year later"
3,fisher price super star stacker....,we got this for my daughter when she was 8 months old. she did not actually play with it until she was 15 months old and by then it was out of batteries.
2,so so,My baby doesn't pay much attention to this toy no matter what sounds or lights are going off on it.
1,Very overwhelming,"This toy is very loud and overly stimulating. When we bring it out my daughter initially sits and stares at it, then quickly goes from staring to crying, and to down right scared. This might be fine for a baby who has siblings, or who is used to a busy home. In my house, this toy does not fit in. My daughters doctor likes to call this toy the ""seizure toy."" With all of the lights, and sounds you are going to quickly find out if you can cause your baby to have seizures. This comment coming from a cranial surgeon made me think twice about letting my daughter play with it."
1,Not pleased!,"I was very excited to receive this toy because it looks like so much fun on the picture. However, I was very disappointed with the quality of the product. I would recommend spending your money on something else. Honestly, I rate almost everything a five star because others on amazon have made great recommendations but this product didn't work out."
5,wonderful toy for baby,My baby loves how this toy lights up and plays music when she stacks and unstacks the stars. I think the lights and music helped her to understand how to use the toy. This toy is one of her favorites. It keeps her entertained longer than most of her other toys and it's not very bulky.
3,now buying non-musical stacker,"In my opinion, the fact that this toy plays music completely overshadows its stacking ability, which is what you are supposed to do with this toy. Until she was around 2 years old, all my daughter wanted to do was push the button and play the music. I don't think she has ever pushed the star down to play the music. For her younger sister, we have bought the basic non-musical stacker, and this one is in the closet."
5,Beautiful Toy!,"My 6 month old daughter loves this toy! The star shapes are easy to grasp and the toy ""twinkles"" and plays a sweet sound every time a star is removed or placed on the stack. The star on top is a little wobbly but actually makes it easy for her to remove. When you push the top it plays a song which brings a huge smile to her face everytime she hears it. It plays nice classical music at a perfect volume. This is a great variation on the typical ring stacker!"
3,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Little Super Star Classical Stacker,I only gave it 3 stars because it was dead on arrival despite telling me it included batteries. It's really not all that educational. Maybe my daugther isn't old enough to understand the concept of stacking yet. She does however love the lights and hitting the stars to make a sound.
3,Not intresting!!,"I bought this for 10 month old son, he barely touched it. There is no on or off button for the music to stop or controll the volume. Also, the base of the stacker is not that stable, keeps tumbling on carpet and floor. Its the basic stacker with little lights, music and unstudy surface nothing intresting."
3,Fun toy but a little tricky!,"Love the toy, flashy, lights up and has music but a little tricky when you try to put on or take off the rings! It has a ""catch"" so when you pull the rings off or put them on, it will make sound. Frustrating for little ones. Overall, a neat fun toy though."
3,He enjoys it.,"I bought this gift for my son as a Christmas gift, which he was 6 months old. I didn't buy it as an educational toy or as a sorter like I see others did, I bought it because it lights up and plays music, I thought that it would excite my son. He didn't get it at first and at 9 months he gets ecstatic about it when even it goes off! I see him take the stars off 1 by 1 and does try to put them back on and has succeeded at this several times. He likes to eat and toss the stars, so I enjoy this toy! It's not the best gift ever, but it is really cute to see his face light up when the lights and sounds go off!"
3,Not that great for my 9 month old,"My daughter, who is 9 months old, only spends a minute or two with this toy before she gets bored. The stacking stars get stuck on the button that triggers the lights/sounds, and must be tugged decently hard to get them off. This is frustrating for my little one, who pulls on them a bit and then gives up in favor of some other toy. The toy's only appeal to her at this age is that it will play a song for a few seconds when she pushes the top star. Maybe it will be more interesting for her in a few months as her hands get bigger and she gains coordination."
4,Pretty good for babies!,"This is a very engaging toy: the music is pleasant, the pieces sparkle, and the star is just too cute! The pieces are a little hard to get on and off but it's not a deal breaker. The only major improvement I could suggest would be making the stacking pieces softer! When I saw the pictures I thought they would kind of be a teether-material, kind of gel-like with a squishy foam star. I was way off though because the pieces are REALLY hard! My baby smacked herself in the chin with a few and it was not pretty. Obviously my fault for misinterpreting the picture but it would have been much better! Still, great value."
2,Not durable,We bought this toy two month ago and it's not working now. It looks fine but there is no more music and lights... We changed new batteries and tried everything we could... We are very disappointed about the quality and durability of this toy.
4,More Music!!!,Our daughter is still playing with this...our stars are a little different but it's the same toy. She has started playing with this more...and likes to push the button on top to play the music and get it to light up. I would suggest this for a gift.
4,Fun,It's your standard stacking toy with a few upgrades! It has mesmerizing lights and music that isn't too annoying for parents. I like that it makes a rewarding little jingle every time a ring goes on or off and play a song when you push the button or put the star on the top.
5,Lots of action,"This is one of the best toy I have seen for babies. I have purchased them as gifts after watching my grandson play with his. The lights, music and action keep them interested. I liked the happy colors and pieces the baby could easily pick up himself."
4,Fun Spin on a Classic,"This is a fun toy for our 9 month old daughter. It is a classic toy with a fun new twist. It still teaches the same way, but adds lights and sounds. Its colors are fun, and the lights make it even more festive. It's also very durable, as our daughter's favorite use of the toy currently is to bang the stars together and throw them. This is a fun toy for an infant."
3,"Nice colors, annoying music!","My 12 month old daughter doesn't really seem to enjoy this toy much yet. She does like to throw the stars around, and push the button to make the music play. Hopefully as she gets a bit older, the stacking part will be something she enjoys!"
4,Wow! Pretty!,"This was a gift for my Daughter. She loves to push the buttons and here the twinkle sound or the music. Only problem...she likes to take the stars off and use the base as a bat. It hurts. Bad. But she likes the pretty colors when the stars light up! Also, the star on the top doesn't stay in place very good..but..it's still worth every penny her Grandpa paid for it! :)"
1,Buy the original!,"What I love about the original stacker is that the child has to put the rings on in the correct order for them to properly fit. With this electronic one, it doesn't matter which ring goes on first - the rings slide all the way to the bottom lights and music will go off. I was looking for a toy that would help teach my child about size/proportion and problem solving. This version quickly went into the get rid of pile and I bought the original stacker, which my son loves!"
3,Lights Are Catchy - But.......,"Ok, this toy catches your eye. It lights up and make music, however, my daughter tries to grab the star pieces and they are way too 'thick' for her hands to grasp. she gets frustrated and cries... If I place it on it's side - she is able to 'slide' them off but otherwise this is a great toy if the parent wants to remove or if your child has BIG HANDS!!!! I wouldn't recommend for a small child."
1,Stopped working after 1.5 month,My 11 month old loved it. But it is the first sound making toy of the about thirty we own that stopped working. And we only just got it a month a half ago and the return window is closed. Not happy.
5,Great toy,"This is a great toy, we bought it for my daughter when she was 8 months old and she played with it every day until she was about 18 months. She loved making the light and music go off and never tired of playing with it. This was a great buy!!"
4,Bright and Colorful Entertainment,"This was a gift from a grandparent before our baby was born. Our child loves it, and has since she was just a few months old. I would press the button for the music and she would watch the stacker light up and play music. Now she can play with it on her own, and even though she doesn't always get the stars on in the right order, she still has lots of fun. I think this toy is durable (it has survived multiple drops out of the playpen!) I also like that it plays classical songs and not just nursery songs, it doesn't get quite as irritating that way. Its also a nice volume, not too loud."
5,A favorite of both old and young alike,I even like playing with this toy and I'm a grandma!!! Both my toddler granddaughter and infant granddaughter love this toy! As you take off the stars it makes pretty music and the lights flash. Same thing when taking the stars off. When you place the top star on it plays more music!!! Such a pretty toy and a delight to play with!!!I wholly recommend!
3,I wish the stars individually lit up,"My baby really loves this toy. A friend recommended it to me who had a son that started playing with his at 4 months old. My baby was just short of 6 months when I got this for her. She really loves how it lights up and she loves to play with the pole piece. She disregards the starts once they are taken off, though. If they lit up, too, or had beads inside or something more to them it would be the perfect toy."
2,Meh...just ok,"I got this toy because of all the good reviews...and you'd *think* that this was something a baby would like. And I suppose plenty of babies do, but my son really couldn't care less. He likes looking at the lights sometimes and maybe chews on the rings some, but he wouldn't even notice if this toy was gone. He's just not really into it and hasn't been very interested in pulling the rings off or putting them on. And there's not much more one can do with this toy...so kind of a waste of money for us. But I'm sure other babies think it's awesome, so maybe just a matter of preference!?"
2,There is no OFF switch!,"There is no OFF switch and no volume adjustment...need I say more? It's an okay toy - neither my 11 month-old daughter nor I has ever found it to be very impressive, and the fact that it has no off switch nearly caused me to return it immediately upon receiving it. I kind of wish I had. It lights up and plays a loud song every time you touch it; how can there be no way to turn it down or off?! I'd like it if she could play with it sometimes without all the noise and overstimulation."
4,Nice stacking toy,My 6 month old daughter enjoys it and I'm sure as she grows she'll continue to play with it. It would be nice if there was an off switch so I can move it without the music playing.
5,This is one of the few toys my son will play with!,"First off let me state my son has special needs so he is much older (by years) than the age group this toy is intended for,but his therapist suggested a stacker type toy to help him with his motor skills. He loves this toy! He literally only plays with 4 toys even tho he has a closet and room full of them ,yet he will play with this toy for hours! Seems really sturdy as it has been dropped and banged on the floor repeatedly and is still going strong! I love it ,he loves it and I would def purchase again!"
4,So Cute,"This was one of the toys I got our little granddaughter for Christmas this past year. She just loves it. She is only 6 months old, so she is not using it fully yet, but so far it really gets her attention every time. The music and noises it makes are so sweet. Not at all loud and obnoxious. We will see how it holds up as she grows and uses it more. So far, however, it has become one of her favorites."
4,Fabulous Fun Toy,"My 7 month old grand daughter's favorite toy. She loves chewing on the rings, banging them anywhere, and watching the lights. The songs are just awesome and very entertaining. Very durable construction. An excellent update of an old favorite."
4,Music and on button is more fun,My son enjoys the tower more than the star rings. He walks around pressing the little button to make the music play. He will do this repetatively during his play time.
5,Star stacker,"My son is still too little to understand stacking the stars back on the stacker, but he loves activating the music and watching the stars light up to different classical tunes. Fisher Price has made a classic toy even better with lights, music and multi-colors. Makes a great baby shower gift."
5,Great toy-Great value,This is one of my daughters favorite toys. She will just sit and stare at the lights and listen to the music. She's at the age where everything goes into her mouth. Each piece has a different texture. This is a great toy.
4,Adorable but a little disappointing,"The Stacker is absolutely adorable, just like in the picture. There are some points about it though that I found very disappointing. They were :1. The volume of the songs is very low2. The songs are very short3. The star on the top does not sit still. It wobbles and I always feel like it will fall off and get damaged, so I can't handle it freely.All in all, it is a nice toy for a baby. I don't think that a baby would care too much about these things, but as a mommy, I was a bit disappointed. I used to have the older model for my older kids (the one with the white base) and that was really fantastic. It was cute and played much louder and longer, so I hope that Fisher Price would revert to these old design features."
3,Great Toy for learning skills,Our 9 month old understands the concept of the stacker however she rather just press the button for the music since she has figured out that is the fun part! We are not a fan of plastic noisy toys but we will let her keep this one :)
5,an improvement on the classic,"My daughter's daycare has this toy (I think thye usually use it without the batteries...). At 13 months, it is simple for her to stack the rings. I believe this toy is more developmentally appropriate for this age than the toy that I grew up with (just like what we have at home), which Fisher Price calls Rock-A-Stack. On the Rock-A-Stack, the pole is slanted, so the rings have to go on in a particular order in order for them to all fit. That skill comes much later than the ability to stack. With this toy, the rings can go in in any order, thus isolating stacking as the relevant developmental skill."
2,Mediocre Tale of Horror.,"I am a fan of Tobe Hooper who directed the original ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" and ""Poltergeist"" but this episode does not live up to his reputation. The story is blurry, unoriginal and not scary at all. It is a tale that has been told many times before. An angry demon of the earth, this time oil under the earth, enters the body of a father and the son witnesses his father brutally kill his mother. Now years later it's time for the evil spirit to inhabit the son's body and cause mayhem and destruction throughout the town he lives in. The story has no real clarity, and there is a no suspense or thrills just mass confusion in the film and outside the film as a viewer. It looks like it was just thrown together at the last minute. If you want some originality and horror watch Hooper's Season 1 contribution called ""Dance of the Dead"" and save yourself some time and money here."
1,"Pointless, dull and definitely NOT horror","The story follows a main character who is trying to cope with the untimely death of his 6 year old son from a rare heart condition. He also seems to suffer from an incredibly acute sense of hearing, which worsens with time. Common, everyday sounds begin to torture him as much as the death of his son.After approximately 10 minutes, I got the general premise and waited for the story to become more profound, more interesting, to insert a twist or two, to do anything other than annoy me with an orgy of overly loud everyday noises. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Oh, and absolutely no horror in it, unless you count the predictably lame ending... and I do not.Save yourself a buck or two, and more importantly, your time."
4,Brilliant Packaging,"I told my wife that she was getting this for her birthday and she went absolutely over the moon. She's already made space for it on the shelf -- next to her Hellraiser puzzle box DVD set and the other Masters of Horror set in the crypt. It will look great next to the Blade Runner briefcase set and the other fun and unique DVD releases that we've managed to collect and enjoy.Packaging can be ho-hum and boring, or it can be half the fun of the DVD release. This falls into the latter category. Great work, Anchor Bay!"
4,"Great series, cool packaging, worth it!","Regardless of previous gripes of packaging, the skull is pretty dam cool. Its a sturdy hard plastic, and as long as the discs are seated properly in the grooves, they are fine. This is probably the only DVD box set I would display, the skull also has some nice details and paint. I don't get some of the nick picky reviews on here anyway, people just find and look for things to complain about.Anyway, this is the long awaited boxed set of the second season of Showtime's phenomenal horror series. Done in the style of Tales from the crypt, but with much better stories and less cheese. Some of the stories were downright gory and some had great horror style twists. A must own for any horror fan."
4,"Very good content, but don't rely on 100% for the Exam.","This book has some very good value. Besides the spelling and grammar errors, there were few shortcomings to speak of. The book gives you good sight into Windows 95, but not enough. I recommend that you do not rely on this resource 100% for your exam. Get other forms of information in addition to this. If you're on the MCSE quest to only get enough info to pass the tests, this book is NOT for you. If you are interested in learning the basics and fundamentals of the OS and getting some information to build on to prepare for the exam, then this book IS for you."
4,Book Review,Pretty Good. Lots of good information for beginners. Kinda boring for experienced users or administrators and support people.
3,"Certainly not bad, but need more for the test","I read this book in preparation for the test, and I found it to be worthwhile. The test is A LOT harder than this book will prepare you for, but some chapters were helpful. I recommend this book in addition to other study materials if passing the test is your main goal. The book does have some typos but they're obvious and not a big deal (just scribble your own corrections!)"
3,Behind the Scenes of Scenes of Behinds.,"I ordered this DVD thinking it might be interesting. It is muchmore than just that. It portrays not only the problems of makinga successful film but it also gives insight into the personalitiesof the people who put it all together. A lot of beautiful bods, tobe sure, but it was good to discover that, inside those beautifulbods were some lovely human beings and some equally lovely guys whoshowed them off to great effect. Can't wait to get hold of theresult of their labors, ""BuckleRoos"". I feel that my journey isonly half over."
5,True affection only,Gay means Happy and this show makes everyone aware of that. Go on buy the DVD and be soothed. If not make a stink about it I don't care the movie was excelent. There is far more to making a picture than fun and games. These characters make friends into family. What a breath of fresh air in this beaten down world!
4,Wonderful!,"What a great extended trailer to the movie BuckleRoos! After watching it, I went out and bought the movie......LOVE IT!!!!!"
2,Not what I was looking for.,"I really was looking for porn not a documentary, but there was nudity and I like nudity.:)"
5,Woolf's essays present the author's stream of consciousness.,"The Second Common Reader is merely an extension of Woolf's own literary genius as she enters into the minds of authors such as Donne, Hardy, DeFoe and Swift, among others. She uses her ""stream of consciousness"" literary tool to incorporate the life of the writer into his or her own work. This book is necessary for anyone interested in stream of consciousness writing and criticism. Woolf, once again, never ceases to amaze me."
4,Anti-suicide-bomber,"The film is clearly anti-suicide-bomber. Reviewers who claim otherwise may be limited by their emotional responses to the film's bias towards the Palestinian perspective. But it's a Palestinian film...The film's intent is obviously to change the thinking of those who would become ""martyrs."""
2,A celebration of death,"The film is a failure. Notwithstanding Hollywood's praise of this film,it fails to offer insight as to how such a culture of death would be celebrated and offered to Palestians, especially children. It attempts to justify those heinous acts which can not be justified. Putting a ""human face"" on evil does not humanize it .. Evil remains evil."
1,sickening,"I guess I feel guilty now of enjoying movies about serial killers (based on true stories such as bundie or sam), the thing that enrages me in regard with this movie is the humanization of suicide bombers, There is no dillema, the suicide bombers do not think twice during their last 24 hours before the deed. Why won't they make a movie about the suicide bombers of 9/11, how poor they were, how pure they were, how they loved thier families, and fighting for freedom, and how they had no choice in doing what they did. Obivously this movie has an agenda supporting the martirdom of a dark age society. There is art, and there is propaganda, there is no peaceful conclusion to the movie, no positive message. Its not even crafted right. If you never been under the knife of terrorism, and never felt the hate, and you are a mindless idiot, then you would like this movie."
1,Terrorisim,This movie is a little too one sided for me. The whole movie shows the hardships of the Palestinians but fails to show the hardships of the Israeli's. How could someone justify terrorisim? Do you see Jews blowing themselves up in German malls today? What will killing civilians benefit? The movie is great at making you feel bad for a terrorist but then again movies can be made about Hitler and Stalin to make you feel bad for them. This is a terrible one sided movie.
1,Sad :-(,"In this movie, they say that they already live in a hell, but in death it will be paradise. It's sad that they don't have anything to live for. People like Jamal who are too weak and scared to do the dirty work themselves, put brainwashed people in their place and send them out to kill innocent people because they don't have any drive in their life. They don't have jobs or education etc so this gives them something to live for. They think they will be collected by angels after the act is done, but they won't.This movie shows two young men who are sent to be bombers. One is really eager, the other a little hesitant. Things don't go as smoothly as hoped for. It is an interesting look at their lives and the reasons behind why they want to do this for their families and their people. But I'm sorry, I just can't accept their choices. We aren't supposed to be pro-terrorism."
1,Zero stars if possible,"This movie makes these terrorists out to be martyres. They are not. They are cowards who blow up innocent people. I thought we were supposed to be opposed to terrorists. The information on this page says this is set in Palestine. When I last looked on a map or atlas, there is no country called Palastine. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Your money would be better spent on almost anything else."
5,Masterpiece,This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. It's brings you close into the Palestinian/Israeli issues without being heavy handed. The characters are as real and believable as you can get and the insight to the situation that you take away with you is indispensable. This is film making at it's best!
5,cinema at its best,"There is a new film movement happening and it is using film as median to tell a humanly story. It is not for entertainments sake; but more for the sake of intrigue. This film in particular stands out among the films of this movement in which the stories are told in underdeveloped places, and the characters all display a raw human quality. It's the perspective we don't get from the news and the media. I would recommend this film to anyone."
3,Very mixed feelings,"This is purely a political piece. Quite a good one.It starts off with the two main characters are close friends who are on some sort of a list to be a suicide bomber. At first, both are keen to do so. Its clear from the start that they are considered by their handlers to being weapons not people. However after awhile, one realizes that this is wrong. He tries to persuade his friend not to do it. His friend however goes ahead with the suicide bombing and for good political effect it is shown to be tough soldiers that he is going to kill.The movie acting goes back and forwards from being extremely good to dismal.Basically the Palestinians are presented as victims, when the Palestinians could have had peace with Israel if they wanted it."
3,"It's the economy, stupid.","One sided view, but worth exploring as food for thought.Bring the standard of living to Middle East, jobs, education, health care, everything that the western world has, and they would forget about suicide missions in an eye blink. Allah panderers and hatemongers would be out of job the next day.Keep the region unstable and impoverished, and there will be unlimited supply of desperate and/or indoctrinated kids like these. Makes you wonder if someone out there benefits from keeping the Middle East a powder keg... Hm, some sticky deep dark stuff..."
2,Very disappointing.,"I wanted this movie to be good so badly. These are deep issues that need to be brought to our attention; however, in the end the film did little to communicate a vague thesis with no conclusions either way.I am also disappointed in Warner Brothers trailer, this film was not the film or the message you see in the trailer. The marketing department worked their magic by changing the color, pacing, adding pop music and the ever dependable deep voice to completely change the films feel, message, and identity. It's one thing to try to resurrect a $100M blockbuster you've blown your summer budget on, it's something completely different to manipulate viewers when the themes, issues, and opinions run so deep!"
4,"Important, challenging and disturbing","Seeing this film a second time, I found it more powerful and more disturbing. I had read the script, and pictured the two leads played by much younger people, which I imagined would give the film a deep sense of the tragedy of the loss of innocence. So I was disappointed when I first saw the finished project.But that's not a fair way to judge a film. What's important is what's on the screen, not what's pre-conceived in your head, and this time I could appreciate it for the excellent, intelligent, emotionally and morally complex and challenging film it is. Any film that can make suicide bombers 'human', without justifying their actions, or can really make you understand the roots of violence and terrorism without condoning for a moment it is an important film for the modern world, and an important film to see.Beyond that, its finely crafted, with terrific performances, and directed to create amazing levels of tension, without feeling manipulative."
5,Great Movie That Is Fair and Promotes Peace,As to the previous reviewer: you should not attack a film you have not seen...In reality this movie does not glorify or demonize the two main characters. The central message of the movie is one of peace as transmitted through the only glorified character in the movie: the rational Suha who only wants peace. The film accurately depicts the state of utter desolation and poverty that Palestinians are living in today. I believe the movie is a great device whose purpose is to give the world another viewpoint on the psychology of many Palestinians and why suicide bombers exist at all.
4,Very good...if you remember it is fiction.,"I think this is an extremely well made, powerful film showing some of the inner struggles of a pair of suicide-mass-murderers. It has some really intestesting things to show about how terror masters manipulate people and how a society where pride/shame is so central can become so terrible.Things to keep in mind: Unlike how it is shown in the film, most victims of Palestinian terrorism are civilians, including children, not military personnel. The film's characters recite ""facts"" about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that are hardly factual. This isn't necessarily problematic from my point of view. I am sure terrorists really do subscribe to that world view and a piece of art (as this surely is) is entitled to artistic license, but I'd hate for it to be confused for an accurate desciption of the facts underlying the conflict."
4,"Good product, directions ok, swing seats not very comfortable.","Adults may hate the seats, kid seems to be OK with it. Cost around $[...] for the lumber and stain to finish it off. Took about 4-6 hours to put together and I have every tool known to man. Make sure to use a pencil and mark the angle of the cross member (2x6 on A frames) saw cuts. Don't do what I did and assume that it is 45 degrees. Instructions were bad on that part. I did two 2x6s for the top beam, screwed and glued together. It was OK, but I think that the 4x6 way may have been better. This is due to the lack of a seam where the swing hanger holes go, if you used a 4x6. Under the weight of a two hundred pound guy this swing moves around a little. Which is to be expected but I think that its pretty study, more than enough for a kid or two. So I guess I'll leave it to them. Good luck."
3,Bad Run of Swing Hangers!,"I don't know how many units were affected, but the kit we got had lots of issues with the swing hanger bolts.The threads on the bolts flattened out just by going through the beam, 2 of them broke while tightening the lock nut and 3 others had the first bit of thread get stripped with the slightest pressure from the nut. Only one swing hanger actually worked.Needless to say, we were concerned with the safety of the kit with all these issues. However, we called the company, they confirmed there was a bad run of hanger bolts and immediately shipped us out 3 new sets. Those bolts all worked fine and the kids are loving the swing set now.Other than this issue, it's a great kit, but I wish they had caught the issues with the swing hangers earlier, or at least notified anyone who bought the kit of the problem."
3,Don't look at pic.,Kit was good and easy to build with the instructions. But buyer beware read the fine print the glider swing doesn't come with the kit.Although the picture with it attached is one of the reasons I ordered this model
3,Extra steps,Well not bad for the Price BUT there are a couple of minor problems.First only one of the quick links was found in box.Second the threads on the Swing bolts has crappy plating and you will need to run a die over the threads.Note big pile of shavings after you do.I found this out as the first bolt broke. Not a happy camper here.Now I have to find replacement bolt and a quick link.But over all it is a good swing set kit.Once they fix the threads on the swing mounting bolts.
5,I love this book,"This book has helped me tremendously in my professional career as a pharmacist! I am reading this book daily and bookmarking pages like crazy! Great read, great author"
4,Put things into perspective,"While the references and time frames in this book are out-dated, the stories and messages that stress and worry have been around since recorded history should be a lesson that we control our own destiny and it is all of us that make a world that can be beautiful or slow torture."
4,Tackling problems head-on,"This book while not a classic like How to Win Friends... still is worth buying and skimming through. I found it repeatitive with too many antedote-page-fillers. That said, though I read it for the first time many, many years ago, the central messages of stopping the build of anxiety through facing a problem head on and thinking through and coming to terms with worst-case-scenario, has stuck with me and proved useful to this day."
5,a must read!!!,this is by far one of the best books I have ever read. Its advice is even more relevant now than when it was written more than half a century ago!
3,It's OK- you will have to pick and choose what works for you,"It's an OK book. I was not familiar with the author. You can definatley tell it was written some time ago, so as far as advice and self help I find it more pratical for myself if I read from current authors. Still there are some useful ideas, you will just need some heavy picking, choosing, and modifying on what will work for you."
5,Incredible,Light yet profound. Entertaining but trueful. I highly recommend this book and/or audio to anyone. The audio is read by an incredible narrator. He has a good clear voice that makes listening enjoyable.
5,Words to live by.,"This book had been on my ""to read"" list but I am just now getting to it. Worth the delay and worth the price."
2,not quite authentic,"Carnegies book was written many years ago, but it can be seen that stuff has been added from more modern times. It remains a useful self-help book on improvimg relationships."
3,"Several good insights, but a lot of anecdotes as well (which is not necessarily bad), making this book feel pretty long.","Several good insights, but a lot of anecdotes as well (which is not necessarily bad), making this book feel pretty long."
5,Inspirational,Not only is it great leadership advice you can use it in your every day living. I recommend taking the Dale Carnegie class also.
2,Cliche Read Today,"Reading this book was a little tiring. While the ideas may have been original at one point in time, today it reads like one cliche after another. I'm dropping off after reading 50% of the book.I wouldn't recommend this book except for, perhaps, its historical significance.My experience was a little surprising to me as I really enjoyed How to Make Friends and Influence People -- that one, despite its age -- seemed to still be alive and interesting."
5,Perfect Fathersday gift,I wanted to drop a line and say that I purchased this for my father and it came quicker then expected the person was really polite and easy to deal with and my father was estatic about the gift itself. thank you for the wonderful product and service.
2,Kindle edition is very frustrating,"This review is not about the contents of the book, but about the quality of the Kindle edition. I don't know what technology was used to convert the paper edition into electronic (I am guessing - scanning and OCR software), but it definitely needs a major improvement. Almost every dash and hyphen was converted into a comma by this process. Sometimes commas are entered in the middle of the word! This makes reading of otherwise great book a very frustrating experience."
5,true to life and practical,"This book is true to life and practical, giving real life examples that we can follow to achieve true success. I was very impressed. I usually don't leave book reviews, but would encourage anyone to read and apply the principles in this book. I have began applying them and they are effective."
5,A must read for high stress jobs,I have a very difficult job and dealing with stress is a difficult thing. Just reading this book helped me gain new perspective. I recommend this to anyone looking to feel comfort from short stories coupled with lessons of relief.
4,Helpful Book,"I found this book helpful. Obviously, some sections struck a chord with me more so than others. I took quotes or lines out of the book and made my own list of inspirational quotes to read through when I need a reminder not to worry about something. I felt this book was easy to read and the multiple examples helped drive home the point."
3,How To Stop Worrying and Start Lifing,"Some advice is timeless and Mr.Carnegie makes some major points. However, one really has to be open to change prior to picking up this book."
4,It's Really GOOD !!,"I was having this book for a long time in my library, but recently i've read it, the techneques which was described in the book are very simple, easy to use and IT WORKS !!It will not stop you from worrying but for sure it will reduce it.I recommend anyone who is jobless or with a searious illness or dispert to read this book."
5,A book for everyone,"Dale Carnegie uses personal stories from years of his students and some of humanities biggest icons. These stories back up each idea and help the reader relate everything to his or her own life. Everyone has stress in their lives and many of us let it get the best of us, especially when we dont realize it. This book and ""How to win friends and influence people"" changed the way I look at life everyday!"
3,Lonely Spirits Overrun Tokyo - Very Few People Notice...,"...Which is precisely why I enjoyed 'Pulse' (a.k.a 'Kairo') . I can see why, given the current J-Horror vogue for explicit scares and evil children, a lot of people got annoyed with it. It is ponderous, slow and somewhat lacking in the scares/weirdness department compared to something likeJu-on (The Grudge)orRingu Anthology of Terror (Rasen/Ringu/Ringu 2/Ringu 0)and it's delayed release has only served to make the internet technology look obsolete - but what you've got to remember when watching it is that its not really a horror film at all, its an examination of the dehumanising effect of technology as well as the alienation, tedium and loneliness that's a staple of modern urban living. If you enjoy contemplative, impressionistic film-making that defies linear conventions of exposition, its well worth a look."
3,Dark and creepy,"This movie is a real downer. Seriously, don't watch it if you're depressed. Loneliness and despair are themes that are stressed (very effectively) throughout the film, which features many dark settings and images.Similar to ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"", the plot was a little hard to grasp and tended to jump around. The characters were not that developed, except for the young guy who played the lead, so it was kind of hard to get a handle on who was who and what their relationship to one another was. Basically, a young guy commits suicide and his friends are thrust into a strange world of spirits, ghosts, and odd images on computers. There are some genuinely creepy images and scenes. At the end we find out that this problem has affected all of Tokyo, where the movie takes place, and the film takes a post-apocalytic turn.If you're looking for gore, you won't find it here. The horror in this film is much more psychological and subtle."
1,Pulse won't make your pulse beat any faster,"I was hoping for something really scary, but Pulse's plot moves slowly and just isn't that frightening. In the beginning it's a little scary, but once you finally discover the concept you'll see it's pretty lame and the ending is even lamer. By the middle of the movie I was so frustrated with it's slowness, poor sound effects and lack of scariness that I was ready to turn it off and put in another DVD. Unfortunately, my friend made me see it through and he was disappointed with the movie as well. Afterward, we imitated the movie's sound effects and pretended we were the ghosts in the movie and had a good laugh. Definitely do not rent this if you've seen any good Asian horror movies before. Don't let the good ratings on Amazon fool you!!"
2,Boring,"After I first saw this I gave it a much too kind 3 star review cause I was a big fan of Kurosawa's 'Cure' and I wanted to like this movie more than I did. Yeah, 'Pulse' has got a number of creepy moments, and it could be decent if you chopped it down by 40 minutes, but at this length it's just remarkably tiresome. The characters are utterly unmemorable and the the horror scenes themselves are generic, played out Asian horror cliches. They're passably well done as far as that kinda thing goes, but nothing exciting and the movie has a remarkable amount of down time which is filled simplistic, existentialist prattling. People wanna tell you this says something about alienation in the technological age, but it doesn't, nothing beyond the basic assertion that we are alienated.Not recommended. If you wanna see some Kiyoshi Kurosawa films, check out 'Cure' or 'Doppelganger' or maybe 'Seance'. (Though that last one definitely ain't great.)Grade: D+"
5,Sublimely transcendent psycho-socio commentary in disguise,"Anyone who has had friendhips fade away and into the past, tried to ""stay connected"" through the internet; or re-connect, will understand ""Pulse"". Anyone who has watched a real world friend disappear into the virtual world of MySpace, blogs, internet gaming and the like will understand. Anyone trying to hold on to the past will understand. Anyone who has ever had to let go will understand. All of us who have ever lived haunted by ghosts will understand.Anyone looking for a slasher flick or even ""The 6th Sense"" will not understand."
4,"Watch this version, not the remake","I saw the American remake first and was put off the idea of an original. Friends talked me into getting a copy (thank you) and as usual the original film is far and away the better version.A very disturbing film about ghosts, technology, internet despair, loneliness, and the collapse of society.Fascinating that special effects can be sparse, but you can have the wits scared out of you by one good professional contortionist. The movie does a great job of playing into visual and auditory notions of right and wrong."
2,all style - no substance,"like most current ghost and horror movies coming out of japan, in ""pulse"", almost nothing happens and what does is incomprehensible. some reviewers have raved about this flick being a masterpiece of a metaphor about the fragmentation of interpersonal relationship at least partially caused by the internet. if so, i missed the boat. it is all style, no substance, but the style of many of the images: deserted, burning gray tokyo, the grimy interiors and exteriors of housing, the horticultural workplace of some of the protagonists, the university computer room, the deserted factory, can be compelling, hence the two stars."
2,What's Up With These Subtitles?,The movie is GREAT but I have a real problem with the subtitles. I've been watching subtitled movies for years and this is the first one where the actors speak and i have to wait a second to read the subtitle. Is anyone else noticing this? it doesn't kill the movie but it is definitely annoying.
3,I don't remember it being like this...,"Well, the comment about the subtitles is true, there is a 2 second delay. When I saw it in the theater, the caption was in real time. The captioning is somewhat messed up. An example is when they displayed the title of the movie, the captioning was under the Japanese text and not in the middle of the screen. No doubt it is a great movie, but it seems that scenes were cut from the original. Like the music would just suddenly cut into a new scene. Hmm, strange. And another thing, its listed unrated, but in the back its clearly rated R. Is it just my copy cuz if it is I'm totally POed."
3,Spanish Scam Artists,"This was a non-comedic, Spanish version of ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels."" It tests whether you can deal with having a main character be villanous. ""The Talented Mr. Rpipley"" did the same thing. The scenery reminded me of Almadovar's work, but the film lacked is quorky messages about gender, sexuality, and sundry topics. It was more interesting near the beginning than by the end. Watching this was a great way to listen to more Spanish and bone up on those skills. This wasn't award-winning, but it wasn't terrible either. Why not peep it?"
1,Terrible study material for the exam,"I can't believe others gave this A+ Complete Study Guide great reviews? This book was horrible. I had to study other textbooks and materials so I can pass the real exam. If I just study this book alone, I would fail the actual exam. The book is so wordy! Blah! Blah! Why do I want to hear long sentences. Just get to the point! And the sentence structure was terrible. I don't understand what was going on most of the time. Just focus on the subject without the jargon. Not enough on Windows XP and networking, but many questions had these on the actual exam."
2,Good for only the Basics,"If you would like to know the basics of PC hardware and Microsoft Operating systems then this is the book for you. If you want to have the confidence of passing the A+ exam then I suggest you look for something else. I was able to pass both exams the first time but I had to depend on twenty-years plus of being a ""computer geek"" to pass. Maybe half of the exam was discussed in the book while the other half was questions that hinted at or not even discussed."
3,Where are the customer reviews?,What happened to the customer reviews? I guess it won't matter what I write here because apparently the reviews have all been nuked and nobody will be able to read this anyway.
3,too much useless information,I read this book from front to back and did all the pre-tests and bonus exams and all the flash cards too. I failed the hardware exam with a 485 (515 is passing).This book is best with tech's who already have plenty of on hands experiance and are finially taking there test after a year or so of working in the field.I read the sybex lab manual as well. I should have gotten the Fast Pass book instead of the lab manual. I will get that and maybe a network+ book too.Be warned there are way too many networking questions on the A+ exam then there should be. You might need get network+ exam cram just to pass the A+ exams.
3,I passed 2day...,"Hey..I just came back from the testing center and I passed with 769 out of 900..anyway, the exam wasn't that hard, mostly basics..it had some tough questions, but not 2many of'em...the book is well organized and the practice tests are good, but I don't recomend depending on only one resourse.therefore, I think that a second guide should be used..the key to pas the exam besides hard studying is to solve as much practice questions as u can...Test King questions are great...Kinan."
4,One Small Problem,I love laffy taffy and I cant get enough but the variety package has candy bits on the watermelon and cherry and its just not the same. You need to order them seperately to avoid the hard candy bits thats mixed with the taffy.
3,Gram Parsons' last Flying Burrito album.,"'Burrito Deluxe' isn't as immediately attractive as its predecessor, 'Gilded Palace of Sin'. for one thing, it is short on those blood-freezing ballads to which Gram Parsons' beautiful voice, worn by experience, was so well suited. We have to wait for the closing track for an authentically affective moment, a cover of the Stones' 'Wild Horses', a reworking superficially faithful to the original, but burring with its own maudlin country feeling. Despite the title, it is more like a slow-motion visit to the knacker's yard. By contrast, 'Lazy Days' rollicks with energy, and is typical of the album as a whole, good-time bar-room rock tinged with Nashville stylings. while these songs are thoroughly enjoyable, full of imaginative musical flourishes, and transport you to some lively hoe-down in a mythical barn, they are rarely as memorable as the sardonic lyrics, an exception being the hazy 'Man in the Fog'."
1,"Wow, how did this woman get published???","After reading Tamar Myers, Phyllis Richman, and Diane Mott Davidson, I was really looking forward to another clever culinary mystery series. WOW, this one really misses the mark! The writing was clumsy and amateurish, with an abject lack of character development and not a shred of wit. I kept thinking, surely it will get better. It didn't. This is bland, poorly written prose wrapped around a thin plot. Pass this one by...."
4,Kansas City at its best - or worst?,"I'm an avid mystery reader and I really enjoyed this book. Heaven Lee, the heroine, is not quite as lovable as Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum or Diane Mott Davidson's Goldy. But she definitely has potential and the storyline makes for a cozy read on a rainy day.To all those of you who found the book ""depressing"", let me say this: you have to have been to Kansas City to understand. I've been living in the KC area for 10 months now (on the Kansas side, mind you...haha) and it REALLY is THAT sad. You don't even have to get out of the car to get the picture.Lou Jane Temple is not making this up....she describes what she knows. Kansas City at its best - or worst.With this in mind, I just know that you'll find her other books more enjoyable."
4,Gene Clark IS the Roadmaster,"Excellent tunes, excellent singers, and excellent musicians; what more can you want? Even though these guys never got together at one time to record these songs, they still sound solid, cohesive and excellent. Gene Clark's ""I Remember the Railroad"" is no doubt autobiographical. You can hear the yearning and aching in his voice. This album, for me, points out how unique and impressive the Byrds were - too bad they didn't last longer in their 5 man configuration. Crosby's harmonies and McGuinn's leads are icing on the cake while Chris Hillman's bass playing is outstanding - easily one of the best bass players of our time."
5,A lost country rock gem,"A delightful odds 'n' sods collection; a couple of lovely tracks cut with the original Byrds in '69 or '70, one with the post-Parsons Flying Burrito Brothers, and eight tracks from a solo album attempt in '72 with various Byrd/Burrito types playing backup. 'In a Misty Morning' in particular will get right under your skin, and qualifies this for inclusion in any 'Grievous Angels' collection. Fans of Gram Parsons, early Joe Ely, and/or Whiskeytown will like this one."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!,This is by far Gene Clark's finest hour in and outside of the BYRDS. The songwriting is impeccable. There is even a full Byrds reunion within the first two tracks on this album. Anyone who is a Gene Clark fan must track down this album.
5,Great!,"I am doing this show in my theater, and needed a soundtrack to listen to----to do choreography with, etc.----and this was great! It has some fantastic voices and gives me all that I need!"
4,Necklace extenders,"These were a well needed item in my jewelry armoire. They have worked beautifully with most of my necklaces. The only challenges I've had were on necklace clasps that have a skinny oval shape. The round clasps on the extenders ends are too big to fit through the ovals. Needless to say they rest right where the lever piece goes in and out of the clasp.I use 4 of the five as I'm not a wearer of gold. I like the variety of sizes and the various looks I can get with my necklaces.Also, the extenders come individually packaged in their own plastic bags with anti-tarnish paper. The 5 bags are placed in a neat ""burlap-esque"" teal pouch which is then packaged in a teal gift box with cotton padding. I was very impressed with the packaging.A helpful hint: I measured each extender and wrote the size on the outside of the bag so I knew which was which."
2,Picture is misleading - links are very large!,"I ordered this expecting that the links would be fairly small from the picture. They aren't, the links on each of the extenders are very large, and don't match any other jewelry I own. They'll do what they're supposed to do, but they're not as I expected at all. If you don't mind large links, then you shouldn't have any issues with this product."
1,Watch out! Caution! Junk!,"Item is Junk. Service is bunk. Need a zero star.Sorry to tell you, but this is JUNK! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, EFFORT OR MONEY ON THIS TRASH.The extension I used for just under 2 hours dropped my necklace on the ground like a rock. Luckily, I wasinsightful enough to test it at home, and did not lose my necklace. Returned faulty items and was charged aHEFTY 20% restocking fee for this trash. thanks alot Amazon, thanks alot Carolyn Pollack Jewelry. Thanks for NOTHING!I will never buy anything from Carolyn Pollack Jewelry AGAIN!!!!"
